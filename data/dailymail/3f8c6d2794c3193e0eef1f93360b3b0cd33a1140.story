A mother of three who is awaiting a double arm transplant at a Boston hospital has had her home burglarized repeatedly since her amputations in 2010.

Katy Hayes, 44, lost all four limbs to a flesh-eating bacteria and has been approved for a double arm transplant at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital in what will be the first such procedure performed in the United States.

But while waiting for the operation, Katy, of Kingwood, says an intruder 'took sentimental items we can never get back'.

'That really hurt us deep. They took 
the necklace my grandfather wore through a Nazi prison and my great 
grandmother's ring we were going to give to our daughter,' her husband 
Al Hayes told KHOU.com.

Katy's
specially modified van was also attempted to be stolen on another 
occasion while her neighbors where out of town at the start of July.

The
family then received another blow when they were asked to leave a hotel
in Connecticut on July 3rd because Katy's disability made the owners 
feel uncomfortable.

Her 
husband said: 'I called the front desk to say the TV wasn't working and 
they guys said we're really not comfortable with your wife's disability 
and we'd like for you guys to check out.

'It was humiliating and frustrating', he said.

The
family have continued to stay positive throughout adversity though and 
Katy says the first thing she wants to do with her new arms is 'smack my
husband.'

Al told the 
Houston, Texas, new site: 'We're blessed. We're lucky. We've won the 
lottery and we're still married even if she's going to hit me when she 
gets her arms.'

Katy will receive two new arms above the elbow but the former massage therapist still hasn't had a date approved for the transplant.

Approved
by the pioneering hospital for the transplant after undergoing a 
rigorous evaluation, Katy has battled through two years of 
rehabilitation as a result of losing all her limbs after giving birth to
her third child in 2010.

'I want my life back,' said Hayes to reporters at a press conference last September.

'I want to hold my children, I want to hug my husband, I want to cook dinner.'

Hayes
lost her arms and legs to a Group A Streptococcal infection that 
accelerated into flesh eating bacteria four days after giving birth to 
her third child.

The former
runner and yoga enthusiast had her arms amputated above the elbow, her 
legs above the knees and also lost her uterus and her large intestines 
as doctors battled to keep her alive.

'I never thought about how much a gift your hands are,' said Hayes at the press conference. 

'When you don't have hands, you can't wear rings.'

After raising $200,000 to cover living expenses, Hayes and her family moved from Texas in July 2012 to prepare for the surgery.

'She knew from day one she wanted arm transplants, not just prosthetics,' her brother-in-law Tom Phelps said to the Boston Herald.

'I’m just shocked and amazed that science has come this far.

'Katy
is just a wonderful and fabulous person, and the tragedy of her getting
the strep and how it ravaged her body was just a nightmare, but she’s 
so strong, she just pulled through.

'I’ll
never forget when she woke up from the coma,' he recalled. 'She was 
like, ‘OK, let’s get to work,’ and we were all saying, ‘No, you need 
some down time.’

Hayes also underwent psychological and physical screening at the hospital to determine her eligibility for the grueling surgery and long recovery.

The transplant could give Hayes the ability to flex and extend her elbows and to lift herself out of a wheelchair.

The level of function she will acquire, especially in her new hands, is uncertain, said Bohdan Pomahac, director of plastic surgery transplantation at the Brigham.

All the previous above-the-elbow arm transplants similar to the procedure being planned for Hayes have been performed in Munich, Germany, by Dr. Christoph Hoehnke.

When the operation is carried out a team of 40 doctors will be involved said Dr. Pomhac.

The double transplant will connect skin, muscle, bone and blood vessels in both arms.

However, while doctors and experts do not doubt the ability of the surgical team at Brigham and Women's to attach arms onto Hayes, some are unsure whether full function will be restored.

This is due to the fact that unlike internal organ transplants, hand and arm transplants are dependent on nerve regrowth to function normally said Dr. Vijay Gorantla, the administrative medical director of the Pittsburgh Reconstructive Transplant Program at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Nerves regrow at the speed of around one millimeter a day said Gorantla, who has been involved in previous Brigham and Women's surgical procedures.

'The recipient nerves have to regrow in the donor shell,' said Gorantla to ABC News.

'At this point, there's no technology to expedite that growth.

'Theoretically, there's a risk that these patients may not be functional or as functional as a distal hand transplant.'

Hayes has paid tribute to the medical team at Brigham and Women's as she prepares to enter the next phase of quest to regain arms.

'These doctors are true rock stars. They’re giving so much hope to people, especially veterans, who are coming home with missing limbs,' she said.

Hayes touched the heart of the nation in 2010 when it was revealed she had contracted a flesh eating bacteria while giving birth to daughter Arielle.

Surgeons in Houston, Texas, had no choice but to amputate her arms and legs to save her life.

After returning home Hayes, a massage therapist, struggled to come to terms with the loss of her limbs.

She was fitted with prosthetic arms allowing her to hold her baby daughter for the first time.

Hayes learned to cope with her new life with the help of her two other children, 18 year old daughter Amber and eight year old son, Jake.

Decision: It was after delivering her third 
child, a baby girl, that Mrs Hayes woke to find her husband had made the
life-saving decision to have doctors amputate her limbs

The mother of three told WFAA TV that she was looking forward to the simple things with the arm transplant.

'Brushing my teeth; washing my face; wiping my own butt,' Hayes said. 'You know — things that everyone takes for granted.'

Her husband, Al, said he is also dreaming of the smaller things.

'I think about things like feeling her arms around me, or feeling her touch my hair,' he said. 'I'm looking forward to her rediscovering the joy in simple touch.'

Brigham and Women’s is working with the New England Organ Bank, a New 
England-based organ procurement organization, to find Hayes a donor.
