Sir Alex Ferguson is set to lift the lid on David Moyes's disastrous reign as Manchester United manager.

Ferguson will give his opinions in an updated version of his autobiography, which will be released later this year.

His view of Moyes will be particularly interesting as he was instrumental in his fellow Scot getting the United manager's job.

However, as the club's season unravelled Ferguson was greeted by more hostility at Old Trafford, where he regularly watched matches.

United eventually finished seventh - the first time since the Premier league's inception they had finished outside of the top four - and did not win a trophy.

United said on their website that Ferguson's updated book would be coming out in October.

They would not reveal the exact contents but said it would, 'offer reflections on events at Manchester United since (Ferguson’s) retirement as well as his teachings at the Harvard Business School, a night at the Oscars and a boat tour around the Hebrides, where he passed unrecognised.'
