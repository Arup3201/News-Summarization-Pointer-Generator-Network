A woman was stung on the hand by a scorpion just as she was getting ready to fly out of Los Angeles.

The eight-legged creature landed on another passenger's shoulder before it was flicked on to the woman right before the Alaska Airlines flight took off towards Portland, Oregon.

Alaska Airlines spokesman Cole Cosgrove says Flight 567 was taxing on the runway Saturday night when the passenger was stung. 

An Alaska Airlines flight was getting ready to take off from Los Angeles International Airport when a woman was stung by a scorpion that landed on her

He says the plane returned to the gate and the woman was checked by medics. 

She refused additional medical treatment but didn't get back on the plane.

Meanwhile, flight attendants killed the scorpion and checked overhead compartments for any additional arachnids. 

The flight then took off at 8:40 pm, about an hour late. 

It's unclear how the scorpion got on the plane, but the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico. 

Members of Oregon State University's men's basketball team were on the flight, Mr Cosgrove said.

'The woman was a real champ. She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck. They had to take her away in an ambulance,' Oregon State Coach Wayne Tinkle said.

Oregonian reporter Tyson Alger posted on his Twitter account that the arachnid first landed on a man's shoulder but he flicked it off and it landed on the unidentified woman

The stung woman was two rows in front of Mr Tinkle, according to ESPN. 

The plane was also carrying the University of Portland's women's basketball team and Oregonian reporter Tyson Alger. 

He posted on his Twitter account that the scorpion first landed on a man's shoulder before it was flicked towards the woman and stung her.

'Chivalry is dead,' Mr Alger added. 

Only about 30 types of the 1,500 scorpion species can inflict deadly stings, according to Mayo Clinic.

While for healthy adults the stings are painful but not lethal, such incidents can be dangerous for children.

It is not known which type of scorpion stung the woman flying to Portland.
