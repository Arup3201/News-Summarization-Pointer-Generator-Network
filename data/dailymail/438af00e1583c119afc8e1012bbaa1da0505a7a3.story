It's one of the nation’s best-loved television shows and has just celebrated Golden Globe success in America.

But Downton Abbey has failed to impress Simon Schama, who has launched a scathing attack on the programme, claiming it’s a ‘steaming, silvered tureen of snobbery’.

According to Professor Schama, one of the country’s leading historians, Downton is guilty of ‘cultural necrophilia’ and is littered with inaccuracies and cliched storylines.

The 66-year-old, a professor at Columbia University in New York, said: ‘It is a servile soap opera that an American public desperate for something, anything, to take its mind off the perplexities of the present, seems only too happy to down in great, grateful gulps.’

Writing in Newsweek, he added: ‘Nothing beats British television drama for servicing the instincts of cultural necrophilia.

‘So the series is fabulously frocked, and acted, and overacted, and hyper-overacted by all the Usual Suspects in keeping with their allotted roles …

‘All the main plot lines were anticipated a long time ago by Upstairs, Downstairs.’ Downton regularly pulls in more than ten million viewers in Britain, and the first series has been sold to more than 100 countries.

In the U.S. it is broadcast on Sunday nights on state-funded channel PBS, and attracts more than four million viewers – double the usual audience in that time slot.

But Professor Schama suggested this was simply down to the ‘unassuageable American craving for the British country house’.

The historian said that Fellowes had sacrificed historical accuracy for a 'bromide of romance'.

'If
Fellowes were really interested in the true drama attending the port 
and partridge classes... the story on our TV would be quite different,' 
he added.

Producer Gareth Neame defended the show, saying: ‘Downton is a fictional drama, not a history programme.’

The stinging attack from the respected historian comes just days after the show's creator Julian Fellowes collected a Golden Globe for the series.

He was joined by Bonneville, who plays Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham and actress McGovern, who plays his wife Cora, Countess of Grantham. Downton has been an enormous success in the U.S., doubling the Sunday evening audience for the PBS channel.

Downton has suffered a torrent of 
criticism over its historical accuracy. A string of blunders have 
appeared in the outdoor scenes, shot mostly in the Oxfordshire village 
of Bampton.

They have included a television aerial fixed to a home, a modern-style conservatory appearing in shot, as well as double yellow lines on a road.

Viewers even claim to have spotted a modern street sign in the background and to have noted that a piece of music which was featured in one episode not yet been written at the time the series is set.

A sting of historians have also blasted the drama. The 'fantasy' portrayal of Edwardian country house life in Dowton Abbey is 'b*******, basically,' A.N. Wilson said.

Controversy

Wealth

A humble background, winning scholarships for his education. Signed a book deal in 2003 worth £3 million - the biggest advance deal ever for a TV historian. The highest paid and most successful historian on TV.

While Edwardian expert Jennifer Newby criticised Fellowes for his portrayal of servants in the country house drama, who look too clean and act far too familiar with their employers. She said the programme was 'infuriating' to watch.

Oscar winner Fellowes, the son of a displomat, has previously dismissed his critics as 'socially insecure, left-wing nitpickers'. But the latest comments are from the most high-profile historian yet.

And they will be particularly poignant, given that Schama and Fellowes both moved to the U.S. in the 1980s and share a passion for the country. Schama became the highest-paid historian on television and his latest series, The American Future, has proved popular. Fellowes has praised the 'mobile society' of the U.S.
