At least 40,000 Australian couples signed up for the intimate challenge of 30 Nights of Nookie throughout the month of September.

The couples were set intimate daily tasks and given a Nookie box of goodies before they began their quest with the end result aiming to bring them closer together in their everyday hectic lives. 

Relationship expert and coach Jacqueline Hellyer says there are endless things that you can do to get in the mood.

'Think of it like a toolbox – lots of different activities and its a different one every single evening,' she said. 

'You can use those to help the two of you connect and have a lovely and intimate time together.'

The idea came for the challenge came about after Durex’s annual State of the Nation survey revealed that almost three in four Aussie couples want more emotional and physical interaction from their partner and 70 per cent are unhappy with the amount of sex in their relationship.

Sydney Swans player Ryan O’Keefe and his wife Tara have shared their 30 day journey and how they coped with juggling looking after their two children and finding the time to spend on themselves.

WEEK 1: THE BASICS  

Tara said the first week was quite challenging to find the time for each other.

'We implemented things like embracing each other a bit more throughout the day,' she said.

'We tried to take technology out and it mean you're not just picking up calls and it’s the simple things but sometimes they are the most effective things.'

'We are addressing everyday as it come and just looking at it quite openly - it's nice to be abel to experiment and work out what works for us and then move forward with that.'

Ryan spent five minutes tidying up the lounge room once the children went to bed  to help get them in the mood 

'It was good to just put everything front of mind - stepping outside yourself,' he said.

'We all can be a little bit self-consumed sometimes so it makes you feel good when you are thinking about others and doing stuff for others than just for yourself.'

Ms Hellyer said kissing is one of the most intimate things a couple can do – it's also one of the most effective ways of getting in the mood and staying connected

Ryan said he hoped the tasks became easier and more natural as the weeks went on.

'You think after so many years will be easy but when you are forced to do it you think "why is this so difficult?".'

The couple found the first week was quite challenging to find the time for each other

WEEK 2: TOUCH 

Ryan said this week was more difficult than the first seven days which involved communication and that probably your biggest thing in a relationship

'Tara is probably more affectionate than I am – she enjoys the hug and the touch – whereas I can take or leave it a little bit more,' he said. 

'Giving her a massage is comfortable and easy although the other stuff is different but it's good to know what each other's likes are.'

Tara said agreed that it was helpful to discuss what each other enjoys to have done to them.

'That’s something that sometimes you wouldn't necessarily chat about as a couple so it's good raising these little awarenesses to these points that you can then get something out of it,' she said.

'Now we are into week two we have been able to roll into it a bit easier.'

WEEK 3: EXPLORE 

The couple were hesitant about a couple of the this week's exploration tasks including using a camera in the bedroom. 

'I felt this week with using a lot of props – it was OK but it didn’t feel natural – I'm a pretty easy going guy - I don’t really need too much to please me,' Ryan said. 

'As you get further into the program – it's more in depth and taking you out your comfort zone.'

Tara said her husband was working on becoming more affectionate in the program.

'It's something that he is following through with and being really mindful of - he gives me glimpses of back at the start how he used to be with our relationship,' she said. 

'We referred back to a couple of other days we enjoyed in the week and we tried to implement those things again.' 

The third week involved exploration tasks which took the couple out of their comfort zone

WEEK 4: MOREPLAY 

This week focused on different ways to make love and keep the creativity flowing.

The task on day 26 of waking the neighbours was a daunting prospect for them.

'Our house is pretty noisy as it is,' Ryan joked. 'But I'm looking forward towards the end when we have special nights where you focus on each other.' 

'A lot of times we have had a good giggle,' Tara said.  

At the end of the four weeks, the couple felt more connected and really in sync with each other.

'Its been fantastic - we’ve been able to take on the challenges more confidently – we are very much on similar pages in terms of the things we like to do in our personal time,' Tara said.

'Its amazing when you focus on something the better you become at it – we have both improved and grown,' Ryan said.

Ryan even found value out of the more cringeful tasks. 

'The things that do stand out are the ones where you think "nah these aren’t us",' he said.

'With role playing – we looked at it and said "nah it's not for us" although the good things are the things that work - you also learn from your mistakes so to speak.'

'It's something we have really enjoyed-  the journey has been fun and the results of it has strengthened our relationship and really get back to what it used to be like - I think it’s a great concept, ' he said.
