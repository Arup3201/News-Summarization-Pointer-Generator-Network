These charming pictures show an almost impossible cute baby gorilla playing with and being cuddled by his mother in a German zoo.

Jengo was born in December and has recently been joined by another baby, which was born during the night between March 10 and 11.

Its sex is still unknown but the birth is a cause for celebration as it is the second gorilla baby to be born within four months in the same group at Leipzig Zoo in the east of Germany.

Adorably, Jengo is also pictured playing with grandmother Viringika at the zoo, which houses the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center, where researchers study the behaviour, perception and communication of apes.

Like the other great apes, gorillas have many traits considered human abd can laugh, grieve, develop strong family bonds, make and use tools, and even think about the past and make plans for the future.

As well as gorillas, the centre has chimpanzees, bonobos and orang-utans.

Practice climb: Jengo clambers up the back of his mother, Kimbara, and pokes out his bright pink tongue

Love: New mother Kumil tenderly holds her new baby, born just days ago. Gorillas are capable of many emotions we consider human
