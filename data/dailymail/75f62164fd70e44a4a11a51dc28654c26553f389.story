Wannabe WAGs have descended on a charity shop after England international footballer Ben Foster donated thousands of pounds worth of designer clothes.

The haul - estimated to total more than 200 items - includes a £700 pair of Christian Louboutin shoes being sold for £50 and a Stella McCartney sequin cardigan worth £855 priced at £70.

Thrifty fashionistas queued for hours outside the Women's Aid charity shop in Shirley, near Solihull, West Midlands, waiting for it to open this morning.

They had been alerted to the bargains after the West Bromwich Albion and England goalkeeper tweeted he had dropped off a pile of his wife, Kate's unwanted threads last Wednesday.

The 31-year-old goalkeeper tweeted: 'Just dropped off a tonne of top designer women's clothes, shoes and children's toys @womensaid on Stratford rd in Shirley, go check it out.'

Included in the four boxes and two bags of donated clothes were sunglasses by Chanel, Prada and Dior all which can be snapped up for £45.

'Normally we'd be lucky to see a couple of people on a Monday but to have some queuing before we opened is madness.
