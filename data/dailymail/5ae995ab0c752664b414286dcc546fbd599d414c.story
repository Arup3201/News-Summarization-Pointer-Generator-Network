It was late Saturday afternoon at Flushing Meadows when Andy Murray and Ivan Lendl finally caught up, having trawled through the bowels of the humming stadium complex to seek each other out.

In these same corridors two years ago they celebrated the Scot's historic U.S Open championship victory, this most eyecatching player-coach relationship having done precisely what it was designed to do.

The odd couple pairing – Lendl had never coached before - came to an end in Miami back in March, and now they were meeting for the first time since the 54 year-old Czech effectively walked out, citing the insufficient amount of time he was able to give to the job.

Success: The pair formed an odd but impressive duo, taking Murray's game to a whole different level

It is clear that there was no personal animosity on either side and Lendl chose this weekend to break his silence on the multiple factors that lay behind his decision to quit, and open the way for another groundbreaking appointment, that of Amelie Mauresmo.

Having won Wimbledon, you might have thought that Murray, who plays his first-round match today against Dutchman Robin Haase, would have needed less of his mentor's time.

In fact, as Lendl revealed, he believed the opposite was the case. 'Everyone is different. And when you win a big tournament like that, it's not easy sometimes,' said Lendl. 

'Some people find it easy, some people find it more difficult, and I'm glad Andy found Amelie who can give him the time he needs.'

As revealed in Sportsmail earlier this month, Mauresmo has committed to 25 weeks travelling per year, while the Czech felt by the end he was only able to give barely half that.

'I also felt that in my opinion Andy needed more time for the job to be done properly. Even 20 weeks was going to be hard for me and I think he needed even more than that.

'I didn't feel I could give Andy the time that he needed. That's what it was and there was nothing else behind it, which is why I have come in today to see him and the guys,' said Lendl, who travelled in from his home in the neighbouring state of Connecticut.

When asked if it was also a factor that the exhilaration of winning the Olympics, U.S Open and Wimbledon would be hard to match he admits 'Yeah, and that too,' but also emphasises the changes in personal circumstances which led to the shock decision six months ago. 

'It was lots of little things combined. Like playing more on the vets tour, and one of my daughters returned home (he has five in all). The youngest one is 16 and she had been away at horse riding school and but now she has come back to live with us.

'My Mum is now 79 and lives in Prague, I need to go more to the Czech Republic than I used to. The planes are a pain in the arse. The places, the hotels - England was good, Australia was good, here it was alright. It was the smaller trips I didn't like.

'All these things combined. And you know with Andy, after his surgery and after winning Wimbledon and all that, I felt that if anything he needed more time rather than less time.'

He admits that it was an awkward evening when they went out for dinner in Miami and he explained how he thought they needed to go their separate ways: 'Yes it was difficult, we sat down and I said "Look if you can come up with a way how it can work please let me know" but neither one of us could figure out a way of making it work.

'Some of the evenings watching him play were not easy either.,' he joked. 'Yeah it's never easy. As they say, everything good comes to an end.It was a different role, different experience and I'm very grateful for that because I never thought I would be coaching, and of course Andy winning made it that much more enjoyable.' 

New team: Amelie Mauresmo began coaching the British no 1 before this year's Wimbledon

Lendl was reluctant to be drawn on the subject of Mauresmo, but did offer the suggestion that she works closely with Dani Vallverdu, Murray's ever present assistant coach who has been the cornerstone of his support team.

'The person who knows Andy the best from the guys in Dani, he is fantastic. He certainly didn't get enough credit. People don't understand how much I relied on Dani. And I hope Amelie relies on Dani as well because he knows Andy so well.

'Many times he would come to me and say "Hey, you need to stop the practice." And I would say "What? He's done? He looks fine to me." And Dani would say "No, he's done."  

More to come: Lendl believes that with Mauresmo coaching him Murray has the potential to win more Slams

'And two or three minutes later he was done. So you hear that two or three times when he's right and you start listening much better.'

Lendl does not rule out a return to coaching: 'Maybe eventually if the situation is right. But the time now is not right. It wouldn't have worked if Andy had called me two years earlier, or if he had called me two years later. 

'And it has to be someone I feel I can offer something to. If it was John Isner for example I am not going to be able to tell him how to hit a serve.'

What he is convinced about is Murray's ability to win more Slams: 'Andy's a great player. He can, simple as that. He is fully capable of winning more majors.'
