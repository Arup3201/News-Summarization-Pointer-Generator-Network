It took the supermarket world by storm when it began selling the French delicacy of champagne at slashed prices.

Now Lidl is hoping for the same result as it forays into the Scottish market with its new range of cut-price kilts and sporrans.

The German supermarket chain, which has become increasingly popular with Britons over the past few years, is offering Scots a Highland Dress outfit for little more than £50.

Lidl has launched a Highland Dress range, featuring cut-price kilts, ghillie shirts and leather sporrans 

The poly viscose kilt retails at a penny under £30 while a set of children's playable bagpipes are just £12.99.

Those who want to add a polyester ghillie shirt can do so for £11.99 – along with a no-frills leather sporran and chain for £9.99.

The outfit will be rolled out across 610 UK stories in the run-up to Burns Night on January 25.

The chain said it has launched the range following a successful pilot in Scotland in July, ahead of this year's Glasgow Commonwealth Games, which saw stock sell out within a couple of days.

During that trial, kilts were £10 cheaper and also three yards shorter - but they now measure the traditional eight yards. 

Lidl non-food buying manager Josie Stone said: 'This fantastic range, at unbelievably low prices, will give everyone the chance to celebrate Burns Night in proper Scottish style whilst showcasing Scotland's proud heritage and traditions.

The leather sporran and chain for £9.99 will be sold in the run-up to Burns Night on January 25 

Traditionalists can also get their hands on a set of playable children's bagpipes for £12.99 

'Highland wear can often be unaffordable to many, costing hundreds of pounds, so it's great to be able to offer an eight yard kilt for under £30.' 

The kilt, available in two tartan patters, has a 24in drop and, unravelled, measures eight yards – the exact length of traditional specifications.

The discounter said it would also promote Scottish food across its UK network from mid January, including Ben Bracken Blended Malt Scotch Whisky Aged 12 Years for £17.99 and a haggis for 99p.

The discounters from the continent have already made the most of their wide-ranging appeal with British shoppers, with Aldi having launched ski and equestrian ranges.

Lidl has made the most of its wide-ranging appeal and is continuing to make gains at the expense of other major players in the market (stock image) 

Both supermarkets have continued to make gains at the expense of the major players.

November figures from Kantar Worldpanel show Aldi's sales 25.5 per cent higher than a year ago while its market share is up to a record 4.9 per cent.

Lidl also performed strongly, seeing its sales jump 16.8 per cent and taking its market share up to 3.5 per cent.  

Standard traditional kilts retail for around £350 and are made from wool.

A Jacobite shirt is about £65, a sporran can cost £300 and a top-of-the-range dress kilt can be as much as £700.

Traditional bagpipes start at £1,200.
