Paul Oddysses vanished from Hollesley Bay on the Suffolk coast on Saturday sparking a major police search

A dangerous robber serving a life sentence is being hunted by police after he escaped from an open jail. 

Paul Oddysses, who was jailed for armed robbery, vanished from Hollesley Bay on the Suffolk coast on Saturday sparking a major police search.

Officers have warned that the 49-year-old should not be approached if any member of the public sees him.

Oddysses, who has connections in Essex and Hertfordshire, also has tattoos on both arms and a scar on the back of his head.

Hollesley Bay is a category D jail which on an 85-acre site which houses 420 inmates over the age of 18, many serving long terms of imprisonment for serious crimes.

More than 100 prisoners are allowed out of the prison on a daily basis to work in the community but police say Oddysses was not permitted to leave the jail. 

Oddysses is described a white man who is 5ft 6ins tall, clean shaven and thin. 

His disappearance follows a string of high-profile escapes from prisons in recent weeks. 

Police are still looking for convict Charlie Casey, 22, who walked out of Sudbury prison in Derbyshire on April 30 where he was serving a sentence for a £365,000 fraud.

Police believe the drug addict has since attacked a woman in Dorset leaving her with serious stab wounds.

Last week Anthony Peloe, 43, who was serving an indeterminate sentence for possessing firearms with intent to cause harm, and convicted robber John Arnold, 30, absconded from Thorn Cross open prison.

Prison officials at the jail in Warrington, Cheshire, discovered the pair were missing at about 10.30am on May 20 and alerted Cheshire Police who launched a manhunt for the inmates.

Arnold was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence carrying a minimum term of two years after being convicted of robbery in May 2006.

Peloe was convicted of possession of firearms with intent to commit harm in December 2005. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence with a minimum tariff of three years.

Following the string of prisoners escaping jail the government has ordered changes to stop convicts with a history of absconding not being held in an open prison.

The government ordered immediate changes after knife robber Damien Burns, 39, and convicted thief Dean Jackson, 27, fled from a Category D prison in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

They walked out on Monday night – just a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley fled from an open prison in Kent, before being caught four days later.

It is the latest in a series of escapes that has heaped embarrassment on ministers and prompted critics to brand the prison service ‘beyond a joke’.

Burns was serving an indeterminate sentence, since 2007, for a knifepoint robbery and Jackson was on remand awaiting a sentence for a theft related matter.

Their escape came just a day after a murderer who absconded from an open prison was arrested after going on the run for the fourth time.

Arnold Pickering, 44, who stabbed a blind man to death, was held for being unlawfully at large at an address in Oldham.

The killer was recaptured by Greater Manchester Police after failing to return to jail on Saturday afternoon.

Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Dean Jackson (right), 27, from 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, failed to return to the open prison HMP & YOI 
Hatfield in Doncaster

Thomas Moffett, a violent thief and fellow inmate with Nazi tattoos who was also on temporary licence, also absconded on the same day from the same prison. Moffett was arrested and is also being held in custody.

MPs have attacked the 'absolute scandal' of murderers being allowed out of prison 'willy nilly'.

In 1991, a judge said Pickering appointed himself as an ‘executioner’ when he decided to kill 53-year-old Thomas Leigh, who was wrongly thought to be a paedophile.

He was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on Saturday. His three previous escapes have been from Strangeways in Manchester and open prisons in Lancashire and Sussex.

Recent cases: Murderer Arnold Pickering (left), who stabbed a blind man 
to death, was arrested earlier this week after going on the run from 
jail. Another inmate, Thomas Moffett (right), 51, also
 failed to return from day release but was arrested for 
being unlawfully at large

Pickering and Moffett, 51, had been allowed out from HMP Kennet – an open category C prison in Maghull, Merseyside – at 9.30am on Saturday. They failed to return as agreed at 4.30pm.

Moffett, who has swastika tattoos on his arms, was jailed for seven years in 2006 for a two-month spree of ‘professionally executed robberies’.

He threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on off-licences in Blackburn. He was caught after an employee slipped an explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash.

Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said last week: 'Keeping the public safe is our priority and I will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders [to] undermine public confidence in the prison system

'Absconds have reached record lows under this Government but I take each and every incident seriously.

'I have already ordered immediate changes to tighten up the system as a matter of urgency.

'With immediate effect, prisoners will no longer be transferred to open conditions or allowed out on temporary release if they have previously absconded, and there will also be no unrestricted "town leave' .

'I am clear that open prisons and temporary licence remains an important tool in rehabilitating long term offenders but not at the expense of public safety.'

Ian McLoughlin was convicted of murdering Graham Buck while on day release

The day release programme is designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training.

But it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed, dangerous criminals.

The government has admitted that more than 1,600 criminals were granted day release last year.

Triple killer Ian McLoughlin last year murdered a man while on day release from prison.

Last July, Ian McLoughlin was convicted of murdering Graham Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day release.

Murderer Joseph Williams carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010.

And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £14million cocaine deal.

Earlier this month it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons, which have minimal supervision.
