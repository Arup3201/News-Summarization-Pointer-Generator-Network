Kitchen cabinet: Ed Balls (pictured) and his wife, Yvette Cooper, have been wining and dining political allies

Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper were last night accused of a ‘lasagne-gate’ dinner party plot to undermine Labour leader Ed Miliband.

The husband-and-wife Labour frontbench duo have each been tipped to succeed the embattled party leader if he is forced to resign before the next Election.

They have been wining and dining hand-picked Labour MPs at their London home and in Westminster.

The couple say that the events are merely intended to boost the party’s morale.

But critics have accused them of disloyalty, claiming that they are attempting to build up their own power base ready to make a leadership challenge.

At a gathering over New Year at their North London home, Mr Balls cooked lasagne for more than 30 of their closest political allies and afterwards the couple’s children performed a party piece.

When a guest cheerily observed to one of the children, ‘Well done! You would clearly make a great leader of the Labour Party,’ the youngster replied: ‘No, my mummy is going to get that job.’

The Balls-Cooper charm offensive has not gone unnoticed by allies of Ed Miliband’s brother, David, who remains determined to avenge his defeat in the contest for the Labour leadership in 2010.

Blairite David is a long-standing personal and political foe of the Brownite Mr Balls. A source close to the former Foreign Secretary said: ‘The Balls-Coopers are like the Borgias. They invite you round to lunch, then pour poison in your ear.’

Mr Balls also reportedly discussed Ed Miliband’s future at a separate dinner he had with a fellow senior Shadow Minister.

According to one account, Mr Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, asked the dinner guest if they thought  the Labour leader would survive.

Worried about falling into the trap of saying something disloyal, the guest declined to answer.

The ‘lasagne-gate’ affair comes after a series of polls showed support for Ed Miliband falling away badly, even among Labour voters.

Mr Balls and Ms Cooper, Shadow Home Secretary, are understood to have invited MPs, peers and other key Labour figures to lunch, dinner and late-evening whiskies.

The party over New Year was held for members of their respective Treasury and home affairs teams.

Mr Balls remains bitter at his defeat by Ed Miliband in the contest that took place after Gordon Brown stepped down as Labour leader following the 2010 Election.

But he has recently been overtaken as a potential future leader by his wife, who is seen as being more attractive to the public than her husband, who has a reputation as a political bruiser, despite making attempts to soften his image.

Under fire: Balls has reportedly raised the questions of Ed Miliband's political survival among his dinner party guests

In recent times, he has toned down his aggressive style and talked of his love of cooking and how he was learning to play the piano.

Mr Balls has also said he cries while watching the TV programme Antiques Roadshow and has claimed that he would happily stand aside to let his wife become leader.

But some observers have said this would be untenable, claiming it would be impossible for the formidable Mr Balls to remain Shadow Chancellor because people would suspect he was still pulling the strings behind the scenes.

He is still viewed with great suspicion by many Labour politicians, and in particular those close to Tony Blair, who say the Shadow Chancellor was at the heart of the Blair/Brown feuding when Labour was in government.

However, other Labour MPs view Mr Balls as one of the party’s few ‘big hitters’, whose warnings that the Coalition is strangling economic growth by slashing public spending too quickly are increasingly being borne out.

A spokesman for Mr Balls last night said that he and Ms Cooper had no comment.
