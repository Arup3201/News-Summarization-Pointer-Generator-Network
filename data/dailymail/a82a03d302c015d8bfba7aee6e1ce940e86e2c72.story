A California murder suspect and his 16-year-old kidnap victim have been spotted hiking together deep in the wilderness of the Idaho mountains - 1,000 miles from his San Diego County home where the teen's mother and little brother were found dead.

About 150 federal agents have converged on Idaho's Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness in the search for 16-year-old Hannah Anderson and her suspected abductor, 40-year-old James Lee DiMaggio.

Tests confirmed that a child's body
found in a Southern California house fire was that of eight-year-old Ethan 
Anderson, whose sister is believed to have been abducted by fugitive DiMaggio, authorities said late Friday.

Police in San Diego revealed today that two riders on horseback believe they saw DiMaggio and Anderson in the rugged 'River of No Return Wilderness' outside Cascade, Idaho, on Wednesday.

Hannah appeared healthy and safe, leading
San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore to conclude: 'As far as we know, it didn't appear she was being held 
against her will.'

San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said Hannah was reportedly healthy and 'did not appear to be held against her will'

Hidden: DiMaggio's Nissan Versa was found covered in brush, hidden in a hard-to-reach area of Idaho wilderness on Friday morning. Police are searching the vehicle for booby-traps

DiMaggio's Nissa Versa car was found this
morning in a remote, hard-to-reach area. It was covered in brush in an 
attempt to conceal it and its license plates were removed.

Authorities have not said whether they think Hannah knows her mother and little brother were murdered at DiMaggio's house.

Police said Thursday they feared that 
DiMaggio, 40, might have rigged the vehicle with explosive booby traps. A
bomb squad was still working to reach the car Friday afternoon and 
inspect it for bombs.

The riders said they encountered a man and a young woman hiking in the wilderness on Wednesday. The pair had a tent and each was carrying a backpack.

DiMaggio is said to be an avid outdoorsman and authorities had previously said he could be hiding out at a campground or in the forest.

The Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness is 2.3million rugged acres of cliffs and mountains and river valleys. It is the second-largest wilderness area in the contiguous United States.

When the riders returned home at the end of the day, they heard news reports of the nationwide hunt for DiMaggio and 'put two and two together,' San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said in a Friday news conference.

The pair called San Diego police Wednesday night to report that they believed they had seen DiMaggio and teenage Hannah.

Missing: Ethan Anderson, 8, and his sister Hannah, 16, have been missing since Sunday, when their mother's body was found in a burned down home. A second body at the scene could belong to Ethan, police said

Suspect: The body was found in the home of James DiMaggio, a family friend who police believe snatched Hannah. Friends said he had a crush on the 16-year-old girl, who did not like being alone with him

Friends say DiMaggio 'had a crush' on teenage Hannah and that he states he would date her if he was her age.

Police
fear DiMaggio is armed with improvised explosives  and could use them 
as weapons if confronted. They also believe he may have booby-trapped 
his abandoned car.

'Working
on the theory that he abandoned the car, we think there is a 
possibility that the car might be rigged,' San Diego County Sheriff's 
Office spokeswoman Jan Caldwell told CNN.

A nationwide manhunt has been was launched after the 
murdered body of Hannah's mother, 42-year-old Christina Anderson, was 
found at DiMaggio's burned home on Sunday night. A child's remains were found in the 
garage and are believed to by the body of Hannah's eight-year-old brother Ethan.

A source told the Los Angeles Times that investigators believe Christina was bludgeoned to death with a crowbar.

DiMaggio was described as being like an uncle to the children.

But Hannah's friend, Marissa Chavez, said 
Wednesday that DiMaggio had developed a crush on Hannah and told her that he would
date her if they were the same age.

'He
said he had a crush on her, but didn't mean it in an intimate way,' 
15-year-old Marissa Chavez told The San Diego Union-Tribune. 'He said, 
"If I was your age, I'd date you."'

Chavez, Hannah's friend, said she witnessed the 
exchange when DiMaggio was driving them 
home from a high school gymnastics meet.

Hannah asked Chavez to join her
from then on whenever DiMaggio drove her to meets because she was 
uncomfortable with the attention, according to Chavez.

'She was a little creeped out by it. She didn't want to be alone with him,' Chavez said.

She
also said that DiMaggio took her to Hollywood in late June or early 
July for her birthday, and that he cut the week-long trip short because he was 
upset that Hannah was paying more attention to her phone than to him.

'After that she never responded to his texts and e-mails,' Chavez told the San Diego newspaper.

DiMaggio was in a 'close platonic relationship' with Hannah, a sheriff’s statement said without further explanation.

Brett Anderson, Christina Anderson's husband and father to Hannah and Ethan, flew to San Diego Tuesday to be interviewed by investigators and to plead with DiMaggio to return his daughter safely.

'Jim,
I can't fathom what you were thinking. The damage is done,' he said 
outside San Diego County Sheriff's Department headquarters.

Addressing Hannah, he said he loves her very much and pleaded, 'if you have a chance, you take it. You run. You'll be found.' 

Sorrow: Their father, Brett Anderson, pleaded for the children's safe return at a candlelit vigil on Tuesday

Mr Anderson lives in Tennessee after moving away from the area for a job a few months ago.

On
Tuesday, Mr Anderson joined hundreds of family friends and neighbors at
a candlelight vigil in the parking lot of El Capitan High School in 
Lakeside, where Hannah was about to start her junior year.

Pink
paper cups stuffed between holes in the fence read 'Pray Hannah' and 
dozens of white, blue and pink balloons lifted into the air.

At the vigil, Mr Anderson and other family members address the large crowd.

'Hannah
will come back and Ethan and Tina, I love you both,' he said. 'We all 
love you. I know everybody’s here for support of all three of them and I
want to thank you all. God bless.'

Destroyed: The body of the children's mother, Christina, was found in DiMaggio's burned down house

The remains of a home owned by 40-year-old James Lee DiMaggio, a suspect in the murder of 2 people, is shown in the Boulevard neighborhood of San Diego County

Her Facebook page reveals a popular teenage girl with a passion for dance. She was also a gymnast on her high school team.

'You would never see her without a smile on her face,' said Marlee Friszell, 16, who attended Hannah's birthday party last week.

Ethan Anderson liked to play football and baseball and go fishing, neighbors said.

DiMaggio is believed to be driving a blue Nissan Versa with California license plate 6WCU986.

He is described as white, 5-feet-9-inches tall, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes, and is currently clean-shaved without the goatee beard seen in his photo.
