A man who was told he would never walk again after a childhood brain tumour left him confined to a wheelchair has defied the odds stacked against him to become a personal trainer.

Adam Low,  of Sunderland in Tyne and Wear, underwent emergency surgery for a brain tumour when he was just nine years old.

But the tumour robbed the now 22-year-old of his sense of balance.

He was left with permanent double vision and was confined to a wheelchair for the next two years, with specialists warning he would never stand or walk again.

But after watching his school friends race around and play football in the park Mr Low was determined to defy their predictions. 

Adam Lowe, 22, of Sunderland in Tyne and Wear defied medics to become a personal trainer, even though doctors had told him he would never walk again after a childhood brain tumour left him in a wheelchair

With the help of an eye patch Mr Low (pictured left) eventually overcame his lack of balance and embarked on his dream career - as a fitness instructor (pictured right)

During his childhood Adam Low endured gruelling physio sessions to teach him to walk again, and he was so determined to play football he would practice for another five or six hours a day

His resolve meant that over the course of his teens he slowly learned to stand and walk, then to run and play sports.

And with the help of an eye patch he eventually overcame his lack of balance and embarked on his dream career - as a fitness instructor. 

Mr Low said it was devastating for a boy who loved sport to be told he would never walk again.

He said: ‘They told me that I would never walk again. I was absolutely gutted - I loved sport, I loved playing football.

‘Lying in the hospital bed I was trying to get up on feet, mum and dad would help me down to try to stand up.

‘When I got home I saw my friends out playing football and I couldn’t do anything.

The brain tumour left Mr Low with double vision, with balance problems, and unable to walk

Before being diagnosed with a brain tumour that was causing excruciating headaches, Mr Low loved sports and games, especially playing football with his friends 

But practising every day meant he began to see positive results.

He said: ‘I had one hour’s physio every other day but I would practise a good five to six hours every day.

‘I had to teach myself to walk again from scratch - it took a good two years.

‘But as soon as I started walking again, I noticed changes in myself, and I wanted to help others who had difficulty with fitness.’ 

Wanting to spend his life helping people, Mr Low launched a personal training business as soon as he left school

Mr Low started developing excruciating headaches as a boy and went to the doctors.

Eventually he was sent to a specialist who recognised the symptoms and rushed him into surgery that same day.

The operation was a success, removing 90 per cent of the life threatening tumour, but left him wheelchair-bound with severe balance problems.

Determined not to give up on sport, he immediately started teaching himself how to walk and would get his parents to help him out of his hospital bed so he could attempt a few steps.

He soon began gruelling hour-long physiotherapy sessions every other day, practising in his hallway for up to six hours a day, using the walls for balance.

After two years he was finally able to walk and by the time he reached 15 he was back playing football with his friends. 

He decided he wanted to spend his life helping other people and after leaving school launched his own business, Adam Low Personal Training.

He now hosts fitness classes, intense cardio sessions and goes to the gym himself five times a week.

He said: ‘I knew as soon as I left school what I wanted to do.

‘I did my first qualification about four years ago when I was 18, ever since then I have been doing more.

‘My initial plan was to help people with disabilities, but I thought there wouldn’t be enough, so I started to help people who wanted to lose weight as well.’

He added that although he is still affected by his ordeal, his personal training allows him to focus on helping others achieve difficult goals.

He said: ‘My balance is still not perfect; when I’m walking I sometimes stumble.

‘I’ve learnt to live with it and correct it and to just get on with it. Now the goal is inspire others to overcome their biggest challenges.’
