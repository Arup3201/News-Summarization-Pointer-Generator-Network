Liverpool's player showed their enthusiasm for Tuesday night's return to Champions League action after arriving at Anfield just after midday - more than seven hours before kick-off against Ludogorets.

Brendan Rodgers' side are back in Europe's elite club competition for the first time in five years and Steven Gerrard and Co are determined to make the most of the experience starting against the Bulgarian champions.

Reds skipper Gerrard was pictured outside the club's famous stadium with team-mates including Mario Balotelli and Raheem Sterling as they begin their final preparations for their first group game.

The trio, along with the rest of Liverpool's squad, arrived in their cars before hopping on a coach and heading off to spend the rest of the afternoon as a team.

Balotelli, who has recently worn bright red trainers to show off his new club colours, donned a similarly garish yellow pair to match his official club polo shirt.

With Champions League holders Real Madrid and Swiss outfit Basle also in Group B, Rodgers will be well aware of the importance of three points on Tuesday night.

The former Swansea boss, who worked as a youth coach for Chelsea during the Blues' run to the final in 2008, has admitted that his life's ambition is to make it there as a manager himself.

'I remember walking out of the tunnel when the teams were coming out,'he said.

'I was behind them and I was picturing myself as the manager in a Champions League final. I was wondering what it might be like.

'With all the experiences of games in that period, they all helped me because in my mind I was looking at the game and making decisions as a manager. To arrive and be at that level is great.

'When we were walking out in Moscow, I was framing the mindset that one day — if this was to happen to me — then I will have been here before. Hopefully, it is something that becomes real.'

Gerrard has plenty of experience in the Champions League, having led Liverpool to their fifth European Cup with a dramatic comeback against AC Milan in 2005.

But having failed to sample the competition for half a decade, the Reds skipper is determined to ensure the club continue to qualify year in, year out.

'This isn't a reward for finishing second last year. I don't see it as a reward. This is where Liverpool should be — and should be consistently,' he said.

'It's the responsibility of myself and the players to give it our best crack. It is important that we have got the Champions League next year as well.

'The players who haven't sampled this and then get a taste of it — once they have had that taste I know they are going to love it. Hopefully, it will drive them on to want to keep it at Liverpool for a long time to come.'
