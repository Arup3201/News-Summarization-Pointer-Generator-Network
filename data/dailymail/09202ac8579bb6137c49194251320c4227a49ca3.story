We've had a freezing past few days in London and I've come to accept the fact that winter is now here to stay. 

Although I love a good night out, with the colder weather it's so much more tempting to stay in with a cup of tea and a DVD. 

Every once in a while it's nice to sit back, relax and have some well-deserved 'me time', as well as pampering my face, body and hair with all my favourite beauty bits.

Binky has been treating herself to a few pampering evenings as the cold nights set in

So this week I thought I'd share with you how I'd spend a perfect relaxing evening in during the winter.

BINKY'S RELAXING PAMPER NIGHT IN

For me, there's no better way to start a relaxing evening in than a hot bubble bath. I love the sensuous indulgent aroma of the Tisserand Signature Blend Luxury Bath Soak, which is made up of natural ingredients to relax the body and mind. 

If I'm feeling particularly stressed I also add in a few drops of the ultra-calming lavender and mandarin scented Tisserand De-Stress Blend Luxury Bath Oil.

While relaxing in the bath I'll usually apply a cream face mask to rejuvenate my skin. As I wear a lot of make-up during the week, it's important for me to keep my skin fresh and hydrated so it doesn't end up looking sallow. 

The La Roche-Posay Hydraphase Intense Masque has a velvety gel-cream texture which is super-soothing on the skin and leaves it looking glowing.

Binky says that it is important to rejuvenate your skin and hair with masks 

As I use a lot of heated appliances on my hair during the week, when I'm having a pamper evening I also take the opportunity to treat and repair my locks with an intensive conditioning mask such as DHC Rich & Moisturising Care Treatment. 

Moisturising your body after bathing can sometimes be a tedious task, but not when you're using a gorgeous smelling body butter like L'Occitane Shea Butter Ultra Rich Body Cream. 

 

Binky's Essentials For A Girly Pamper Night

The thick, comforting formula leaves skin feeling nourished and supple without leaving any greasy residue – plus the cream's marshmallow and sweet almond extract means your body will be smelling divine for hours.

Long baths can sometimes dry your hands out, so I always use the luxurious rose-scented Paul Edmonds Cashmere, Rose de Mai and Patchouli Hand Lotion after bathing – its light, nourishing texture leaves my hands feeling amazingly soft.

Once I've slipped on a fluffy dressing gown and settled myself in front of the TV, I like to relax with a cooling gel face mask like the DHC Bio Cellulose Mask to keep my skin feeling plumped and refreshed, as well as reducing any redness or agitation on my face. Simply leave on and chill out for 20 minutes to reveal a thoroughly more radiant complexion.

These are Binky's pampering picks for a luxurious night in

If you suffer from under eye bags, I thoroughly recommend the DHC Revitalising Moisture Strips for Eyes. Place the cooling gel patches under your eyes for around half an hour for visibly brighter and more awake-looking peepers. Perfect if you've had a heavy weekend!

To round off my pamper evening, I love lighting a scented candle like Yankee Candle in Clean Cotton – which fills my whole bedroom with a beautifully crisp, fresh aroma – and painting my nails a new shade ready for the week ahead.

I tend to opt for deep, dark and mysterious tones on my talons during the colder months; my current favourites are Michael Kors Glam Nail Lacquer in the shimmering indigo blue hue Femme Fatale and my very own Binky London Gel Nail Polish in Beaufort Burgundy.

Hope you enjoyed reading about my perfect relaxing evening in – you can get all the products I mentioned from Escentual.com. Will you be planning something similar soon? I'd love to hear what pampering products you'd go for!
