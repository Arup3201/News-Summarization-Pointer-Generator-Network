An Apollo 8 astronaut who was among the first to orbit the moon is set to help re-enact the 1968 Christmas broadcast from space.

Millions tuned in on December 24, 1968, when Commander Frank Borman, Bill Anders and James Lovell took turns reading from the Book of Genesis as the Apollo 8 orbited the moon.

Lovell is expected to attend Monday's event at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, where the original Apollo 8 Command Module is.

The crew circled the moon 10 times on Christmas Eve, according to NASA.

The famous 'Earthrise' photo was taken during the same mission.

As the Apollo 8 crew headed back to Earth, Mr Anders read a passage from Genesis in the Bible.

He
 then added: 'And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, 
good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you - all of you on 
the good Earth.'

Illinois Governor Pat Quinn is expected to attend Monday's event marking the 45th anniversary of the broadcast.

The famous 'Earthrise at Christmas' photo was taken by the Apollo 8 crew in 1968. Since then the festive season and space have been entwined

'The world needed an uplifting message
 in 1968 and the heroic Apollo 8 astronauts delivered,' Quinn said in a 
statement ahead of the event.

Lovell
 took part in several missions, including as pilot in the Gemini 7 
flight in 1965, a command module pilot on Apollo 8 and a commander of 
Apollo 13.

The Apollo 8 mission happened the year before U.S. astronauts walked on the moon.

But the iconic Christmas broadcast proved seminal for many of the space crews who followed in their vapour trials.

The Skylab 4 crew were next to spend Christmas in space in 1973. The crew made a Christmas tree out of food cans to get them into the right spirit.

A Russian and American crew celebrated the holiday on the Mir space station in 1996. Then in 2000 the Expedition One crew spent a quiet Christmas on the fledgling International Space Station, opening gifts and talking to their families.

Astronauts have been in space on every Christmas Day since then. Festive activities have included assembling and frosting a cake in the shape of a candy cane and tucking into a traditional turkey.
