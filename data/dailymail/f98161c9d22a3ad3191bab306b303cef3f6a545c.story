A teacher who allegedly plied dozens of teenage pupils with drink and drugs and took them home for private bondage sessions has been banned from the classroom indefinitely, a hearing has heard.

Glyn Adrian Bevan, 55, was caught with a cache of inappropriate photos of teenage boys depicting a decade of drug-taking and bondage parties.

Bevan was a French teacher at Risca Community Comprehensive School, near Newport, South Wales, for almost two decades until he was suspended in 2010.

He later resigned.

Police raided his home in Rogerstone and found the photographs and equipment, such as gaffer tape and rope, which could have been used as bondage gear.

They went on to trace a group of 26 of the boys depicted in photographs seized and found 10, aged 14 to 16 when the images were taken, willing to give statements.

The veteran teacher was later charged with three counts of indecent assault on a boy under 16, all of which he denied.

Bevan, who had suffered a brain haemorrhage in 2009, later failed to show up for a court hearing in April 2011.

Police eventually tracked him down to the Forest of Dean where he was living rough.

He was acquitted of all charges last year when he was ruled unfit to stand trial.

A General Teaching Council for Wales (GTCW) hearing today found all the allegations of unacceptable professional conduct against Bevan were proved.

They included claims of sexual activity with teenage pupils at his school upon which he avoided criminal prosecution due to ill health.

The hearing, which Bevan did not attend, examined evidence alleging he engaged in inappropriate and/or sexual activity with teenage boys, including one or more pupils at the school.

The professional panel, which sat in Cardiff, heard the allegations covered a period from September 1991 to December 31 2000.

Specifically, they alleged that he encouraged pupils to visit his home, supplied them with illegal drugs, plied them with alcohol and gave them money.

He was also accused of creating or getting pupils to create inappropriate and/or indecent photographs and indecently assaulting one or more teenage boys.

Panel chairwoman Jacquie Turnbull said: 'The facts proved above constitute "unacceptable professional conduct", meaning conduct which falls significantly short of the standard expected of a registered teacher and seriously undermines public confidence in the profession.

'Mr Bevan's conduct is fundamentally incompatible with his role as a registered teacher.

'He posed a serious risk to the safety and welfare of pupils.'

The panel went on to impose a Prohibition Order against him, removing him indefinitely from the register of qualified teachers.

He has the right to appeal to the High Court within 28 days.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
