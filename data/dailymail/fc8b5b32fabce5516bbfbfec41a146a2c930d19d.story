Almost 200 vintage travel posters from around the world went under the hammer on Tuesday night in New York, fetching winning bids totalling over $510,000 (£322,496).

Featuring designs from Australia and Great Britain, the posters are a throwback to an age of travel where beach holidays were for the well-off, steam trains were the norm, and commercial aircraft had propellers.

British seaside resorts featured heavily in the auction, as well as train routes, and many of the posters were placed at railway stations throughout the UK between the 1920s and 1940s.

The painting of British seaside resort Felixstowe was sold for $5,500 (£3,370)

Rail companies used the posters to beautify ticket offices and train platforms while advertising their routes - this design sold for a staggering $20,000 (£12,250)

The posters were designed in the 1920s and 1930s for large railway companies that operated around the United Kingdom with the intention of filling seats on their trains

A holiday to the seaside gave an opportunity to family and friends to enjoy themselves

The London, Midlands and Scotland (LNS) London Necropolis Railway (LNR) poster, showing a night train en-route to Scotland with the slogan 'It's quicker by rail' fetched a staggering $20,000 (£12,250).

One buyer was keen to get his hands on a poster for a holiday in Southport, painted by Fortunino Matania, shelling out almost $10,000 (£5,800) for the piece, which featured smiling faces of bikini-clad women around an outdoor swimming pool.

A painting publicising beach time at Felixstowe went for $5,500 (£3,370), while a design for Blackpool, at a time where stag and hen parties were nowhere to be seen, went for $1,875 (£1,150).

One advertising the famous Yorkshire resort of Scarborough features a demure couple picnicking on a hill overlooking the town's golden beach.

Another, for nearby Bridlington, shows young couples sitting on a promenade wall enjoying a cigarette with a packed beach in the background. 

Beach holidays were a thing for the middle and upper classes back in 1930s Britain

Rail companies knew by using smiling faces and great scenes, it could tempt people to use their services

The rare posters are a throwback to a golden age of train travel when Britons’ family getaways were much simpler and staycations were the norm

The total amount of money raised from the sale of almost 200 iconic travel paintings was $500,000 (nearly £322,500)

About 50 of the lots were Australian-themed travel posters either produced by railway and tourism bodies or shipping companies and airlines. Amazingly 48 of these were owned by one collector.

The Australian collector in fact owned just under half of the lots put up for sale at the Swann Auction Galleries event.

Nicholas Lowry, president of Swann Galleries, said: ‘These posters were designed in the 1920s and 1930s for the large railway companies that operated around the United Kingdom with the intention of filling seats on their trains.

‘They also wanted to beautify ticket offices and train platforms where most of these posters were intended to be displayed.

‘The posters bear striking, colourful and eye catching images from destinations which the different rail companies serviced. Some show lifestyle images giving visual snapshots of the way of life of the elegant people who vacation in those spots.'

A major push for travel from England to Scotland made the rail companies commission posters to demonstrate how easy it was

The promotional posters fetched thousands of pounds when they were sold in the New York auction

With vertical and horizontal folds, this poster for Great Yarmouth and Gorleston on Sea went for $3,500 (£2,200)

The collection also featured a number of Australian travel posters - not surprising since just under half of the entire lot was owned by a mystery Australian man

The Australian collector, as well as wanting to show off his own country, evidently had a penchant for Great Britain

He added: ‘I have never been to Scarborough nor Southport, but I can certainly imagine that even at the time these posters were created that the areas being promoted did not, in fact, look as glamorous in real life as they did in the posters.

‘Neither have I been to either Skegness or a British holiday camp, but I cannot imagine that such a parade-like, attractive, happy riot of humanity is what the average holidaymaker encountered upon their arrival there.’

He said: ‘It is without doubt the single best selection of British travel posters that have ever been offered for sale at any one time in terms of being the highest in quality and the rarest and most desirable.'
