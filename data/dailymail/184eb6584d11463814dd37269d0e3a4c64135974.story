Shamed CIA boss David Petraeus has spoken out for the first time since his affair with his biographer became public, forcing him to resign - and revealed he is determined to make his marriage work.

Breaking his silence almost a week after he dramatically stepped down, Petraeus also revealed he has not spoken to his mistress, Paula Broadwell, since the scandal emerged and denied he had ever given her classified military documents.

He maintained that his shock resignation on Friday had nothing to do with hearings about the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, which he was due to testify at this week.

Instead, Petraeus, speaking with HLN reporter Kyra Phillips, said he stepped down as he was deeply remorseful about the affair and the only honourable thing left to do was to admit his failings.

Speaking out: David Petraeus, whose affair with biographer Paula Broadwell led to his resignation last week, has said he is committed to making it work with his wife and acknowledges his mistake

And, relaying her conversations with Petraeus to HLN on
 Thursday, Phillips said he was now focusing on repairing the damage inflicted on his family, including his two adult children, Anne and 
Stephen.

He admitted to
 her that he had 'screwed up terribly' and that he 'felt fortunate to 
have a wife who is far better than he deserves,' Phillips said.

'He knows he made a big mistake,' she said. 'He does 
want to move forward making things work with his family. He doesn't want
 to throw 37 years out the window with his wife.'

'This woman is strong,' she added of Holly Petraeus. 'She knows what she wants. She's 
obviously, according to people that know her well, not happy about this 
- very, very upset about this.

'I do not know if she's committed to 
working this out with Petraeus... But I
 do know that Dave Petraeus does not want to throw 37 years away and 
would really like to make this work and make things right with his 
family.'

Petraeus, 60, revealed 
very little about his ten-month affair with Broadwell, 
which ended in July, but said they had not spoken since Friday.

'They have not talked since this story 
broke,' Phillips said. 'They talked a couple of times when he ended this relationship 
which was a couple [of] months ago. But they have not talked since the 
story broke.'

These 
previous conversations have been confirmed by sources who saw Petraeus 
and Broadwell chatting at an intelligence event in Washington on October
 27, weeks after the start of the FBI probe.

In
 a further twist to the scandal on Wednesday, it emerged that Broadwell, a married mother of two, 
had admitted taking military documents from government buildings to her home.

The revelations, which caused FBI 
agents to swoop on her house in Charlotte, North Carolina on Monday night, added to fears that the 
affair could have allowed a national security breach.

But Phillips added: 'He
 has insisted to me that he has never passed classified information to 
Paula Broadwell. As long as I have known him, he has never wavered on 
classified information, ever.'

Phillips
 added that Petraeus denied that the scandal was leaked in order to 
allow him to step down before testifying about the September 11 attack 
in Benghazi.

'He has said this has nothing to do with Benghazi and he wants to testify,' she said. 'He will testify.

'He has maintained to me all along this was a personal failing... which, as I said, to me was quite stunning and to many other people... And so he has made it very clear that this was about an extramarital affair and not over classified information or Benghazi.'

In the week since the affair emerged,
 the scandal has implicated an increasing number of players, including a
 top U.S. general whose job now hangs in the balance.

Petraeus
 and Broadwell, the author of his biography 'All In', met during his 
2006 visit to Harvard, where she was a research fellow, and they kept in
 touch, eventually starting an affair as he took over the CIA in 2011.

The
 relationship came to light after Jill Kelley, who organised military 
social events in Tampa, Florida, began receiving anonymous threatening 
emails telling her to keep away from Petraeus.

Implicated: Jill Kelley, a Florida socialite who organised military parties, reported threatening emails she was receiving from Broadwell to the FBI and during their investigation, the affair was discovered

Latest addition: Kelley told FBI agent Frederick Humphries about the emails and he allegedly became 'obsessed' with the case, sending her a topless picture - which he has since called a 'joke'

Kelley, who became friends with Petraeus and his wife through her work with the military, reported the emails to the FBI, who traced the emails back to Broadwell.

Some emails contained classified information about Petraeus' whereabouts that was not publicly available, so the FBI, believing there had been a security breach, launched an in-depth investigation into the sender of the messages.

In the process of their investigation, they uncovered emails revealing Broadwell had conducted an affair with Petraeus and later, in October, interviewed both parties, who admitted to the affair.

On November 6 - Election Day - the 
FBI told Director of National Intelligence James Clapper about the probe
 during a phone call. He then spoke with Petraeus and advised him to 
resign.

Two days later,
 President Obama was told about the affair and Petraeus visited him at 
the White House to hand in his resignation.

Obama accepted Petraeus' 
resignation and he stepped down as the head of the CIA on November 9.

The
 scandal also dragged in another general, the U.S. Commander in 
Afghanistan, General John Allen, as the FBI investigated Kelley's emails
 from Broadwell.

During the
 probe, they reportedly uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of email 
correspondence between Allen and Kelley, both of whom are married with 
children.

While they both 
deny any wrongdoing, officials have claimed some of the emails were 
'flirtatious' and another likened the contents to 'phone sex'.

Allen, who will be promoted to NATO 
supreme commander in Europe, remains in his position but the promotion 
is on hold while the investigation continues.

And in yet another odd twist, the FBI
 agent Kelley initially contacted about the threatening emails, 
Frederick W. Humphries II, was dismissed from the case after reportedly 
becoming 'obsessed' with it.

Involved: During the FBI's search, they also reportedly discovered thousands of 'inappropriate' and 'flirtatious' emails between Kelley and Gen. John Allen, pictured with his wife Kathy and their daughter Bobbie

Backing: President Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, both left, said they have faith in Gen. Allen, right. They are pictured with David Petraeus as their roles were announced in 2011

He even sent Kelley a topless photograph of himself, but Humphries now insists he was never assigned to the case and the picture was simply a 'joke'.

As the scandal seemed to engulf an increasing number of people connected to the military, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has said he is 'unaware' of any more names of those involved.

But in a memo, which does not explicitly name the scandal, he has asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review ethics training and to brainstorm on ways to steer officers away from trouble.

His press secretary, George Little, said the memo was the product of internal Pentagon discussions that began before Petraeus announced he was resigning due to his affair.
