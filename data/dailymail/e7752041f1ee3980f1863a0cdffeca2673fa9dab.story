A policewoman who was guarding Downing Street on the night the Plebgate affair unfolded was arrested yesterday.

The 46-year-old constable from the Diplomatic Protection Group was held over alleged leaks to the Press.

She was on duty when Andrew Mitchell, who was the Tory chief whip at the time, asked officers to open the main gate so he could cycle through.

Investigation: Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, right, ordered an investigation into the 'Plebgate' affair that forced former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, left, to resign

When the officers refused, Mr Mitchell swore at them before pushing his bicycle through the pedestrian exit.

A police log, which was written by one male and one female officer, claimed Mr Mitchell called officers ‘f****** plebs’.

The September 19 log was leaked to a newspaper and led to the resignation of the chief whip.

Last night it remained unclear whether the officer who was arrested was the policewoman who helped write the log.

Fresh evidence, including this CCTV evidence, has emerged since the row which has raised questions about what really happened

The constable was arrested at her workplace in central London on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.

She is the fourth arrest in the investigation, which is called Operation Alice.

A 46-year-old male officer was arrested on Thursday and was bailed to a date in March. He has been suspended from duty.

Four other constables in diplomatic 
protection have been told they are under investigation and three of them
have been placed on restricted duties while their conduct is probed.

It is not known whether these officers were on duty in Downing Street during the exchange.

Mr Mitchell has always denied using 
the word ‘pleb’ but admitted swearing at the officers. He claims he 
said: ‘I thought you were here to f****** help us.’

He believes he is the victim of a 
conspiracy by police officers after it emerged that an officer who 
claimed to have witnessed the row while off duty later admitted he had 
not been in the area.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
