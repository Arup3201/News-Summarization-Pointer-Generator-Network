A three-bedroom bungalow on a Thames island once awarded to Admiral Nelson is going up for sale for £700,000.

The small isle is known as 'Pharaoh's Island' after it was given to the famous naval commander to celebrate his victory in the Battle of Nile .

The bungalow, named Pyramid after the battle's Egyptian setting, has a riverside lounge, luxury kitchen, two bathrooms and within the grounds are two summer houses.

The three-bedroom bungalow, called Pyramid, on Pharaoh's Island near Shepperton Lock, Surrey, is up for sale for £700,000

The property has a garden overlooking the river, where Admiral Nelson - who was given the island to honour his victories - used to fish

The only problem for a potential owner however is that the house is only accessible by boat. Many residents of the island have their own private boats but there are also communal rowing boats to get to shore.

The bungalow features a stunning river garden on the water’s edge, where Nelson used to fish, but which has now modernized with a raised Jacuzzi hot tub.

Pharaoh’s Island is on the Thames just upstream from Shepperton Lock, Surrey and the bungalow, named Pyramid, is one of 24 houses on the island.

The isle was one of many honours Admiral Nelson received after winning the Battle of the Nile in 1798 - and each house has an Egyptian name.

After reaching the island by a short boat trip, there is a central pathway leading through the wildlife haven to a large green used for various events in the island's social calendar.

Admiral Nelson, pictured in the painting by Lemuel Francis Abbott, was given the island after his victory in the Battle of the Nile, and he used to fish in Thames

As well as being private because of its boat-only access, the house boasts a 31-foot riverside lounge, seperate guest accomodation, Jacuzzi hot-tub and a 61-foot deep water mooring

Estate agents say the property offers great views of the Thames, and the area where Nelson used to fish has now been modernised with a hot-tub

The house - named Pyramid - is one of 24 on the island, which all have names linked to Egypt in honour of Nelson's battle

Estate agent Robert King, who also lives on the island, said: 'It's a unique property and really a way of life for any prospective buyer.

'The island community is very close, it's not just a wave as you go past, it's "how are you? Can we help you?"

'Lots of residents on the island have their own boats, but there are also ferry boats which you can row across yourself.

'It's also very handy for day trips out of the Thames in both directions and obviously we have had a lot of interest because of the history of the island.'

The Battle of the Nile was fought between the British and French navies at Aboukir Bay off the coast of the Egypt in August 1798.

The British fleet, commanded by Nelson, had been pursuing the French fleet, under Admiral Paul D'Brueys, across the Mediterranean as French general Napolean Bonaparte sought to invade Egypt to constrict British trade routes to India.

The fighting was ferocious and Nelson himself was hit in the forehead, but with a fleet of just fourteen ships, he managed to capture six French vessels and destroyed another seven out of a total of seventeen.

The British suffered 218 killed and 677 wounded but French losses were far worse, with an estimated 5225 men killed, wounded and captured.

The victory meant Napoleon's army in Egypt was cut off and forced to surrender by a British force in 1801.

The battle has since been immortalised in a number of famous paintings, including the 1825 masterpiece by Mather Brown, pictured.
