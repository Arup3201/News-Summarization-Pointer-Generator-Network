Could the current conflict in
Syria be the latest sign of the end of days? Apocalypse buffs with unlikely predictions of impending Armageddon seem to think so - including an author who
claims to have been a consultant to former Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin
Netanyahu and who seems to have the ears of former presidential candidates Rick
Santorum and Rick Perry.

'The innocent blood shed by the Assad regime is reprehensible and 
heart-breaking and is setting the stage for a terrible judgment,' best-selling author and self-described Jewish believer in Jesus Joel C. Rosenberg wrote in a blog post last year.

However
unlikely the wild theory may seem to established foreign policy experts, the
fringe belief that the conflict in Syria could be the beginning of the end for
mankind stems from an Old Testament prophecy called the 'burden of Damascus,'
which is found in Isaiah 17.

Armageddon? Evangelists fear the conflict in Syria is the beginning of end times, as described in the Old Testament

Burden of Damascus: Author Joel Rosenberg's biblical theories about the Middle East are getting a lot of attention as the crisis in Syria escalates

The prophecy contends that conflict in the Middle East will ultimately leave Damascus - Syria's capitol - in ruins, which, the prophecy claims, will bring the world one step closer to Armageddon. 

'Damascus is about to be removed from being a city, and will become a fallen ruin,' the prophecy states, implying that the city will be destroyed by God on behalf of Israel as one of the final struggles for mankind.

How will Damascus fall? As Rosenberg notes, the Bible isn't exactly clear. However, one of his books offers his prediction - and it starts starts in Damascus.

Rosenberg's Twelfth Imam series describes the emergence of
the Mahdi, the Muslim messiah, which leads to the rise of a new Islamic 
caliphate in the Middle East.

The new caliphate, Mother Jones explains, then 'prepares to decapitate Israel by 
launching nuclear warheads from Damascus.'

Powerful friends: Rosenberg has the ear of former presidential candidate Rick Santorum

Texas Governor Rick Perry subscribes to Rosenberg's theory on the 'burden of Damascus'

Rosenberg's series is described on Amazon as 'a
great read for anyone interested not only in the prophetical future of 
Israel but for Iran and Syria as well…[It] makes one want to keep his or
her eyes wide open on current day Middle East events, and see if they 
line up to eschatological Old Testament passages.'

Rosenberg's prophecies may seem somewhat out there, but he's regarded by many as 'a modern-day Nostradamus' for his expertise on nuclear policy, particularly as it pertains to the Middle East. Santorum even wrote a foreward for the hardcover version of Rosenberg's most-recent novel, Damascus Countdown, and even had him on his radio show to discuss the book last spring.

Texas Governor Rick Perry - who ran for the presidency in 2012 and is expected to do so again in 2016 - met privately with Rosenberg in March to discuss Damascus Countdown

Other Christian doomsday mouthpieces are capitalizing on the burden of Damascus theory - Jan Markell, a Christian radio host frequented by former Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, sent out an email blast last spring warning of the tension in Syria leading to the end of the world.

Doomsday: Rosenberg plans to meet with Kansas Governor Sam Brownback this weekend to discuss the situation in the Middle East

On Friday, just before President Barack Obama announced he was taking his plan to launch missile attacks on Syria to Congress, Texas-based evangelist Hal Lindsey - who has been warning of the burden of Damascus for years - offered a dire warning on his television program.

'As I prepared for this weeks program, I was again struck by the speed 
with which events are moving into the scenario the prophets predicted 
for the end times,' he told his audience. 'I believe we're there. People
on the street are talking about what all of these things mean. Folks 
that wouldn't go darken the door of a church or pick up a Bible are now 
very curious. This may be our greatest opportunity—maybe even our last 
opportunity—to share the gospel of Jesus Christ before we're silenced by
political correctness.'

Rosenberg has plans to go to Topeka, Kansas on Saturday, where he will meet with Republican Governor Sam Brownback to discuss the conflicts in the Middle East.
