Gary Neville has defended Robin van Persie following his slow start to the campaign, insisting his Manchester United team-mates must do more to help the misfiring striker. 

The Dutchman has netted just three times in nine Premier League games and fired another blank in Sunday's derby defeat by Manchester City.

Van Persie already lags seven goals behind rival Sergio Aguero at the top of the scoring charts as United have got off to their worst start to the season since 1986. 

However, former Red Devil Neville insists the 31-year-old needs better service to trigger a scoring spree. 

He told Monday Night Football: 'There's pressure on Van Persie, people want more from him.

'He's got to do better in long situations and needs to make better runs. But his team-mates aren't finding him as much as [Paul] Scholes and [Michael] Carrick were two years ago.

'I called him a burglar before - he lives off back of centre-backs. The type of pass he wants is into space. 

'In defence of Van Persie I don't think his team-mates are in synch as they were two years ago. Maybe Carrick coming back will help him.'
