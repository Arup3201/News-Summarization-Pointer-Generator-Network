Alistair Darling has revealed he will stand down as an MP at the next general election with a warning that Scotland could face another independence referendum unless Labour halts the SNP advance.

Mr Darling, who led the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence, spoke of his disappointment that Labour had not capitalised on the 'No' vote in the referendum.

It comes amid recent opinion polls that suggest Labour is on course to lose the vast majority of its Scottish seats at Westminster to the SNP at the next general election. 

Former Chancellor Alistair Darling has announced he will stand down as an MP at the next general election

He told the Financial Times: 'My frustration is that we actually won. You can't say it often enough. We made the arguments, we had confidence in ourselves.' 

The Labour MP for Edinburgh south west backed former Scottish secretary Jim Murphy to reverse the party's fortunes in Scotland following the resignation of Johann Lamont last week.

Three candidates - MP Jim Murphy and MSPs Sarah Boyack and Neil Findlay - are standing to succeed Ms Lamont as leader, with Kezia Dugdale MSP and the MP Katy Clark hoping to become deputy.

He said: 'Jim has the enthusiasm, the energy and above all he's a fighter. For too long we have sat back when we needed to fight.'

Mr Darling, 60, said he wanted to step aside from politics while he was still 'relatively young'. 

He may now forge a lucrative career in the private sector, but has hinted he may return to front-line politics to fight to keep Britain in the EU during an 'inevitable' referendum. 

In a separate interview with the Edinburgh Evening News, he said: I've been an MP for 27 years, many of them on the frontbench, I was Chancellor during the economic crisis and I’ve just fought a gruelling referendum campaign. Now it’s time to move on.

’I'm sorry to go, but it’s better to go when you’re still enjoying it rather than hanging on too long.

'I hope I’ve got many years in front of me, but I want to go and do something different.'  

His departure comes despite some Labour backbenchers wanting Mr Darling to return to the party's front benches, possibly as a replacement for Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor. 

Mr Darling, who entered Parliament in 1987, served as Chancellor between 2007-2010 after a holding a range of Cabinet roles following Labour's election in 1997.

Alistair Darling had 'fundamental disagreements' with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown over key economic policies during the last Labour government

He led the Better Together campaign which last month defeated the 'Yes' campaign by 55 per cent to 45 per cent. 

Prior to that, he served as Chancellor under Prime Minister Gordon Brown during the collapse of Northern Rock and the subsequent global banking crisis.

In his memoirs, he spoke of the tensions between the two men which increased markedly.

'Relations between myself and Gordon became progressively more difficult,' he said.

'We had a fundamental disagreement in 2008 as to how bad this (the financial crash) was going to be. And then during 2009 we had this whole argument about what you do about the deficit.'

And he said the last 18 months of Mr Brown's government had a 'permanent air of chaos and crisis' about them.

He said he always feared Mr Brown regarded him as a 'stopgap' chancellor and said he resisted efforts to replace him with Ed Balls, a close ally of Mr Brown, in June 2009.

Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna said Alistair Darling had made an 'immense contribution' 

Jim Murphy, who Mr Darling has backed to lead the Scottish Labour Party, said he 'deserves all our thanks' 

Tonight Labour MPs paid tribute to Mr Darling, who also served as Secretary of State for Transport, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Secretary of State for Scotland. 

Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna said: 'Very sad to hear Alistair Darling is standing down at the next election. He has made an immense contribution to our country and our party.

'When Alistair Darling gets up and speaks in the Commons, all sides of the House of Commons shut up and listen. He'll be greatly missed.'

Jim Murphy, who Mr Darling has tipped to lead the Scottish Labour Party, said: 'History will judge Alistair Darling to have made an immense contribution to Labour, Scotland and the whole UK. Deserves all our thanks.'

William Bain MP for Glasgow north east said: 'Huge contribution to public life made by Alistair Darling. He showed politics can be honourable, decent and change countless lives for the better.'

David Miliband, brother of Labour leader Ed, said: 'My retiring friend and colleague Alistair Darling is a gentle giant of politics: high on integrity, low on ego.' 

Mr Darling's departure will come as a further blow to Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was found to be even less popular with voters than Nick Clegg in the most recent YouGov survey.

Just 18 per cent think Mr Miliband is doing well, giving him an overall satisfaction rating of minus 55 - one point behind Liberal Democrat leader Mr Clegg.  

During a near 30-year career in frontline politics, Alistair Darling rose from being a 'safe pair of hands' minister to greater prominence as chancellor.

He spent his formative years in Edinburgh, attending the city's exclusive Loretto public school.

He became an advocate in 1984, two years after being elected to the former Lothian Regional Council.

After becoming an MP in 1987, Mr Darling rose quickly through the Labour ranks.

In opposition he served on the front bench in several roles, including as home affairs spokesman. 

Following Labour's 1997 election win, Mr Darling served as chief secretary to the Treasury.

He then replaced Harriet Harman as social security secretary (a job later re-named work and pensions secretary).

Mr Darling once said he would like to be remembered as 'the minister who began to eradicate poverty', but was targeted by pensioners outraged when their pensions were raised by only 75p.

The episode led to a rebellion at Labour's conference in 2000.

Mr Darling, said to have a skill for mastering complex briefs in record time, became Secretary of State for Transport in 2002, when Stephen Byers resigned amid the collapse of Railtrack.

His proposals for road pricing - not universally popular among drivers - sparked fierce debate.

Mr Darling's later comments, while at the Department of Trade and Industry, that Britain's future energy needs may have to be met partly by a return to nuclear power, also raised eyebrows.

Alistair Darling rose from being a 'safe pair of hands' minister to greater prominence as chancellor

Following Gordon Brown's elevation to Prime Minister in 2007, he was handpicked for the job of Chancellor.   

Mr Darling, memorably warned in the summer of 2008 - not long before the collapse of Lehman Brothers - of the worst financial crisis in 60 years.

The chancellor later said the resulting Brown camp backlash was like having the 'forces of hell' unleashed on him, but Mr Darling stood firm.

When Mr Brown apparently tried to evict his long-time ally (and neighbour) from No11 in the summer of 2009, it was widely reported Mr Darling threatened to resign. 

In his memoirs, published after Labour was voted out of office, Mr Darling said there was a 'permanent air of chaos and crisis' when Mr Brown was prime minister. However, the pair were reconciled during the referendum campaign where Brown played arguably the crucial role in helping to keep Scotland part of the UK. 

Despite losing the election, Mr Darling was possibly able to take some comfort that his prediction of financial meltdown was, as he put it, 'fairly accurate'. 

Despite initially insisting he was not interested in leading the pro-Union Better Together campaign Mr Darling returned to the fray and helped defeat Alex Salmond in the independence referendum on September 18.
