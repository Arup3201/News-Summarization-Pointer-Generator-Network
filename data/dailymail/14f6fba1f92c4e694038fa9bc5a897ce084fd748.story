In a message dedicated to safety and stronger laws, the Prime Minister said that national security was a priority, and that the Government was working towards 'a stronger and more prosperous Australia'.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten reflected on some of the challenges that 2014 had thrown at the nation, and said that Australians had 'responded to division with unity; fear with strength'.

Mr Shorten said he would continue fighting for a 'fairer Australia', addressing the push to recognise Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. 

The Opposition Leader called the move 'the challenge of a generation, and one we cannot abdicate,' reported The Australian.

He addressed the need for the Labor Party to continue encouraging the 'march of Australian women through the institutions of power'.

Mr Abbott also called for greater opportunities for all Australians, addressing economic concerns. 

'So the Government’s priorities for 2015 will be to create more jobs, to reduce costs for families, to build roads, to strengthen national security and to create opportunity for all,' said Mr Abbott.

We can expect 2015 to bring its share of challenges and when they arise we will do what we have always done: we will turn to each other, we will work together and we will make whatever decisions are needed to strengthen our country and its people,' he said.

The Prime Minister said that the national security was a priority, and that the Government was working towards 'a stronger and more prosperous Australia'

While pledging to fight for a safe and secure nation by updating counter terrorism legislation, Mr Abbott also addressed the upcoming centenary of the Gallipoli campaign, calling it 'the most significant commemoration in a generation.' 

'In remembering the ANZAC’s sacrifice, we will draw on our own strength and confidence for the future,' said Mr Abbott.

'So this New Year’s Day, let us re-dedicate ourselves to building a better Australia – with more opportunity for everyone,' he said.

'Happy New Year Australia!'
