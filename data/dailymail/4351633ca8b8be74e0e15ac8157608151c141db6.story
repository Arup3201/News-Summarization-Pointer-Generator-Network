An 80-year-old passenger is dead and a 52-year-old pilot is injured after a small plane crashed into the parking lot of a San Diego retail store on Wednesday, according to officials.

The female pilot is being hailed a hero for landing the single-engine aircraft in a parking lot between Costco and Target, avoiding scores more deaths.

The aircraft bounced while attempting to land at the Montgomery Field Airport around 5:25 p.m. local time, became airborne again and then crashed in the parking lot, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor.

The female passenger was pronounced dead at the scene and the pilot was transported to a nearby hospital after she was pulled from the burning aircraft by good Samaritans.

No one on the ground was hurt by the crash itself.

Helicopter pilot Vince Carter said he heard the pilot tell the control tower in a radio transmission that her 1988 Mooney M-20L had lost power on take off.

The Montgomery Field radio tower received the distress call right before the crash.

'Problem now. I'm not getting any altitude her,' the pilot says calmly in the call.

'27 mike-pappa, full throttle,' the tower answers.

'I'm full throttle,' the pilot replies.

'27 mike-pappa, turn back to the field if you're able,' the tower says.

'I'm going down,' she says, now clearly frightened.

Local news video footage showed the charred remains of the plane, with one of its wings and its nose crushed.

According to CBS News, the plane clipped the top of a store before it crashed.

The pilot has serious injuries but police LT. Steve Behrendt said she was expected to survive.

He told 
reporters, 'We were very fortunate that it crashed right between both 
stores and didn't hit anyone or any vehicles on the ground. ... We were 
very lucky this time.'

Carter praised the woman's skill to avoid injuring far more people.

'This
 is a miracle and testament to her skill as a pilot. I really hope she 
comes through everything okay. This could have very easily killed a lot 
of people,' he told NBC.

'You could imagine, just shopping at Target, and a plane comes through the roof full of fuel.'

Gregg Smith was working in a nearby office building and saw the plane in trouble. It nearly hit his building, he said.

'I knew they didn't have enough power to do the things they needed to do,' he told KNSD-TV. 'I knew it was going down.'

Smith said the plane left his view at that point, but he heard a loud thud and then the crash.

'The next thing I saw was a bunch of black smoke,' he said.

Smith said he ran outside as he called 911.

He said 15 to 20 people were standing around the plane, some with fire extinguishers, and they managed to get the fire out before it reached the plane's fuel tank.

Television news reports showed the white plane mostly intact, but its nose and one wing were torn up.

'The front of the passenger compartment, the engine is essentially broken off,' city fire spokesman Lee Swanson said. 'The landing gear is off, it's lying flat on its belly. There's some debris for several yards in each direction.'

The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the accident, officials said.
