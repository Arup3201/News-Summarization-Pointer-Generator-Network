In a recording obtained by the Daily Mail, Norman Lamb warned of a looming £30bn-a-year black hole in the Health Service’s finances

The NHS is about to run out of cash and ‘absolutely vital services’ will have to be slashed unless billions can be saved, a health minister has claimed.

In a recording obtained by the Daily Mail, Norman Lamb warned of a looming £30billion-a-year black hole in the Health Service’s finances. By 2021, he said, the scale of the funding gap threatens ‘dire’ consequences for patients.

It is the first time a minister at the Department for Health has admitted the financial problems facing the NHS.

Speaking at the Orange Book Conference – a Liberal Democrat event held last month – Mr Lamb, minister of state at the Department of Health, said that the NHS faces a ‘funding gap of £30billion per year’ which austerity measures meant the Government would not be able to fill.

‘If you take health…by 2021 if things carry on as they are, there is a funding gap of £30billion, £30billion per year, and so to be in the position to suddenly find vast amounts of extra money to throw at service, and given the state of public finances and indeed the changing ratio of people of working age to people who aren’t, quite dramatic in our society, that seems to be an unlikely prospect,’ he said. 

‘The potential consequences of the status quo are that across the country you lose absolutely vital services which people rely on, and for me the consequences of that are too dire to contemplate.

‘So there is an absolute imperative that we think about how we get a better value from public services.’

NHS England has warned that within the next few years the service is ‘about to run out of cash in a very serious fashion’. 

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied there is any existing black hole in the NHS, and insisted the Government is making savings to contend with increasing demand for services.

Asked if he would have to request a bailout from Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Hunt told Radio 4’s Today: ‘No, and I think it is wrong to describe it as a black hole.

‘Every year, because of an ageing population, we have additional demand for services and we have to make efficiency savings. Over this Parliament, we have found about £20billion of efficiency savings which we are investing in more doctors and nurses on the front line.

‘And every year we have a challenge in the NHS to find those efficiency savings.

‘We have had a very difficult few years as a country but every family up and down the country has learned to live within its budget, and we too must live within our budget in the NHS. We are doing that and I’m sure we will continue to do that.’

Some members of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet want the party to commit to increasing National Insurance by a penny to pay for extra NHS spending.

The rise would replicate Gordon Brown’s 1 per cent rise, which was introduced in the 2002 Budget to increase investment in the Health Service.

David Cameron told MPs this week that for the first time, the independent Commonwealth Fund had ranked the UK’s Health Service as the best in the world.

‘It has happened only under this Government,’ he said.

But Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘You can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.

‘Despite hubristic claims to the contrary, we now know there is a crisis, and it’s due to the bad decisions and botched reforms David Cameron has made.’
