Manchester City fans will be eagerly anticipating the return of striker Stevan Jovetic after seeing the 25-year-old showcase his keepy-uppy skills at City's training base - with an American football.

Jovetic posted a video on Instagram of him freestyling with the football on Thursday, showing some impressive footwork during the short clip.

The Montenegro striker is currently sidelined through injury with fellow strikers Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero also out, giving Manuel Pellegrini real selection problems in attack.

Jovetic is one of a number of high-profile forwards Manchester City have on their books

Jovetic, who signed for £22million over 18 months ago, is still yet to complete a full 90 minutes in the Premier League for City.

But judging by these tekkers he has displayed, the forward will have no problem getting plenty of minutes on the pitch between now and the end of the season.

City take on Crystal Palace on Saturday as they look to cut the three-point gap on leaders Chelsea.
