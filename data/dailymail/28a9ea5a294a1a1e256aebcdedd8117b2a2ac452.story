A pair of brothers who were convicted of killing a drug dealer may be freed after 25 years in jail.

Raymond and Thomas Highers, now 46, were found guilty of killing elderly marijuana dealer Robert Karey, 65, at his Detroit home in 1987.

They are now awaiting a new trial, after a chance Facebook encounter uncovered new testimony.

Last night they were released on bond and were greeted by a cheering crowd as they walked out the William Dickerson Detention Facility in Detroit.

'It's kind of overwhelming, but it's a great day,' said Raymond Highers, reported Detroit Free Press.

'Thank God for this day.'

They are not completely free as they are now awaiting the possibility of a second trial in a killing that happened in 1987.

Two weeks ago Wayne County Circuit Judge Lawrence Talon threw out the convictions and ordered a new trial after a 2009 Facebook post prompted new witnesses to come forward.

Conditions: Each were granted a $10,000 bond but required to post only 10 percent to be released

A new trial was granted after a Facebook post by a former resident of the neighborhood where the brothers had lived led to the discovery of new witnesses which cast doubt on their guilt.

Among the findings, one new witness said they saw Mr Karey being shot by two black men, but the brothers, who are 11 months apart, are white.

Prosecutors argued that the new evidence was not credible and suggested there was a conspiracy to free the brothers, who have always maintained they were not guilty in the killing.

The two men have scores of misconduct violations against them, according to prison records, with offenses including assault and battery, substance abuse and disobeying orders.

'We've maintained our innocence all these years because we are innocent. ... We're not running from nothing,' Thomas Highers told Judge Talon earlier in the day in asking for release.

'We're looking forward to our day in court.'

Yesterday Judge Talon released the brothers on bonds of $10,000 each, requiring them to post $1,000.

Decision: Raymond Highers, left, and brother Thomas. Two witnesses, a psychologist and their former warden all said they did not think the brothers posed a threat to the community

Prosecutors argued against the low bond, but Wayne County Circuit Judge Lawrence Talon said he didn't believe the brothers were a threat to the community.

Judge Talon requested a recommendation from prison officials on their behaviour behind bars, before making his decision.

Two witnesses, a psychologist and their 
former warden all said they did not think the brothers posed a 
threat to the community.

Both brothers stood before the judge and
spoke passionately in brief statements, assuring Talon they know the 
risks that face them and how hard they will work to reintegrate with 
society.

'The question is, are they the same people they were 25 years ago or not? And the court doesn't believe that they are,' Talon said according to the newspaper. 'So, I am going to grant a bond.'

Rules of their bond, include prohibitions on drugs and alcohol, addiction-recovery counseling and random urinalysis tests.

Outside court the brothers aunt said they would enjoy 'spaghetti and meatballs, two beautiful beds ... and family' on their first evening free.

A pre-trial hearing is set for August 29.
