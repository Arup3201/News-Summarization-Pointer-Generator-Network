As he strolls on the beach with his beautiful girlfriend, Max Chilton betrays not a flicker of nerves at the task ahead of him.

This weekend, with the eyes of his country upon him, the former public schoolboy from Surrey will live out his childhood dream: racing in his first Formula One Grand Prix.

The 21-year-old Briton, who will race as part of the Banbury-based Marussia team, is the newest and youngest British driver to start the new F1 season on Sunday.

Mr Chilton, who was relaxing in Barbados with girlfriend Chloe Roberts, will line up on the grid in Melbourne alongside more experienced British drivers Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button.

After a childhood spent watching the prestigious races on television, he says he is looking forward to realising his dream at the pinnacle of motor racing.

'Ever since I can remember I sat on the living room floor on Sunday afternoons watching F1 races,' he said.

'I would not step up to Formula One unless I was ready and I 100 per cent believe that I am.'

Mr Chilton, whose wealthy businessman father Grahame is proprietor of the Carlin Motorsport team, was educated at private Ardingly College in Sussex.

He began his career at the tender age of ten in go-karts and showed a flair for racing, quickly graduating to T-car racing at the age of 14.

After finishing second in the Championship, he graduated to Formula Three at 16, and then on to Formula Two at 18, where he finished fourth.

Two years later, in 2011, Mr Chilton 
was chosen by the Force India F1 Team to take part in their Young Driver
Test.

He did so well in the Marussia F1 Team Young Driver Test at 
Silverstone the following year, they promoted him to Reserve Driver, 
before making it into the final team for this weekend's race in 
Australia.

Mr Chilton is 
one of two drivers for the Marussia F1 Team in the 2013 season, the 
other being 23-year-old Frenchman Jules Bianchi.

The
team, which debuted at the Bahrain 2010 Grand Prix, is the only one 
with two novice drivers and is run by Pat Symonds, former race engineer 
to Michael Schumacher.

Also lining up on the grid on Sunday will be fellow British drivers Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton.

Like
Max Chilton, Mr Button, now 33, began his racing career young, racing 
go-karts at eight, before making his Formula One debut with the Williams
F1 team in 2000.

Lewis 
Hamilton, 28, from Stevenage, had grand ambitions from the start.Â  At 
ten, he approached McLaren team principal Ron Dennis and told him 'I 
want to race for you one day'.

Mr
Button and Mr Hamilton are glamorous figures around the world's tracks,
and both have the attractive girlfriend that is de rigueur for F1 
drivers.

The British drivers were out on the track in Australia today in practice sessions ahead of Sunday's big race.

Lewis Hamilton was running second in the second practice before careering across the gravel and nudging a tyre wall.

Meanwhile, last year's winner Jenson Button found himself languishing in 11th place after two practices.

Sunday's Grand Prix, which is said by motor racing experts to be wide open this year, will start at 6am UK time.

Melbourne's Albert Park will host Sunday's Grand Prix, where drivers will have to do 58 laps of the 5.3km (3.295m) track
