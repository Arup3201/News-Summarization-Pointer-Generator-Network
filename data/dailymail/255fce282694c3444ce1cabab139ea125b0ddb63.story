Saido Berahino has been backed to return to scoring ways by Alan Irvine after five Premier League games without a goal.

The 21-year-old striker has not found the net for West Bromwich Albion since converting a late penalty against Crystal Palace in October.

Irvine refuted the suggestion the spotlight from Berahino's England call-up or arrest for drink driving had affected him and revealed he is studying clips of Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa in an attempt to improve.

Berahino has seven Premier League goals this season and is keeping record signing Brown Ideye out of the team.

'We’ve asked a lot of a young player,’ said Irvine. 'He had a very, very good start to the season, there was a lot of interest in him, a lot of talk about him.

'He last scored against Man United and that proved to be a vital point as far as being selected for England squad – it’s been a lot of focus on a young player. He’s handled it well overall.

'But I don’t think any of us would be surprised to see Saido dropping off a bit. But I believe he will come back. He’s a good finisher with both feet. The goals will come again.’

Asked if he might bring in an experienced striker in January, the West Brom head coach replied: 'You’re always looking to see if you can bring in players who will make you’re group better.

'Experienced players will help Saido, if he plays enough with Victor (Anichebe) he’ll pick up things too.

'We talk to him about movement of Aguero and Costa. He looks at that himself. He’s a young player and like any other striker he goes through spells when not scoring.’
