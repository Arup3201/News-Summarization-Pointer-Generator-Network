The gunman who opened fire at a Delaware courthouse on Monday killed his son's ex-wife and her friend, who were preparing to appear in court to continue a long-running legal battle over the shooter's three granddaughters.

Thomas S Matusiewicz, 68, was reportedly furious with Christine Belford - who had gained full custody of his three granddaughters after his son was sent to prison for kidnapping them in 2007 and taking them to Central America for 18 months. 

Belford and her friend Laura Elizabeth 'Beth' Mulford were at the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday morning for a child support hearing against Ms Belford's ex-husband, David T Matusiewcz.

Murdered: Christine Belford, center, was killed when her ex-husband's father opened fire in a Wilmington, Delaware, courthouse. Her ex-husband abducted the couple's three daughters in 2007

Tragedy: Matusiewicz opened fire in the lobby of the courthouse, before he had to pass through metal detectors. He shot four people, two of them fatally

David Matusiewicz was in the lobby of the courthouse when his father opened fire with a .45-caliber pistol and shot dead Ms Belford and Ms Mulford. Thomas Matusiewicz also shot two Capitol police guards in the chest before he was killed in an exchange of fire with the officers.

The officers were saved by their bulletproof vests and sustained only minor injuries.

Police detained David Matusiewcz on Monday and questioned him for several hours. It is unknown whether he played any role in the shooting. On Tuesday, he was scheduled to appear in federal court for an unrelated probation violation hearing.

Released: The dead woman's husband was David T. Matusiewicz, who served four years in federal prison and was released in April

Thomas Matusiewicz watched both his son, who was once a promising optometrist, and his wife Lenore go to federal prison for the 2007 kidnapping of his grandchildren from Ms Belford.

The Wilmington News-Journal reports that Matusiewicz seemed convinced that his former daughter-in-law was abusing his granddaughters. He told the newspaper in 2009 that he had hired a private detective to investigate their home life.

'Once that stuff seemed to start happening, he wasn’t shy about accusing his daughter(-in-law), talking about drugs and saying all kinds of things, like "She shouldn’t have the kids" and, "They’re no good,"' former neighbor Walter Rieth told the News-Journal.

He said Thomas Matusiewicz owned several guns and talked about hunting on property he own in New Jersey.

Ms Belford's neighbors say she was terrified of her ex-husband's family.

They say she installed cameras and a security system at her house and took other steps to protect her children.

'She had all the windows changed with special locks. She had cameras around the house. She had two huge dogs. She didn’t know whether she should get a gun. Her house is like Fort Knox, so I thought she was safe,' neighbor Lois Dawson told the News-Journal.

Witnesses said Thomas Matusiewicz's rampage had deadly efficiency. He stepped off the elevated leading from the parking garage to the lobby of the courthouse and immediately pulled out a pistol and opened fire on Ms Belford and Ms Mulford.

He then fired on two officers who were guarding the entrance to the courthouse.

The shooting occurred about 8.10am in the lobby, where up to 60 people had lined up to pass through metal detectors to enter the main part of the building.

David Matusiewic's 2007 kidnapping of his daughters became national news and was featured on programs like 'America's Most Wanted.'

Deployed: Heavily-armed SWAT officers fanned out around the courthouse to ensure there were no other shooters

Secured: The New Castle County Courthouse has rows of metal detectors and up to ten security guards. However, the gunmen opened fire in a lobby while people were waiting to pass through security

In March 2009, authorities found the 
girls living with Matusiewicz and his mother in a squalid, cramped 
trailer in Nicaragua along with Lenore. The daughters were ages 4, 6 and 7 at the time. One of the girls is autistic.

Matusiewicz
 was arrested for kidnapping and also convicted of forging his wife's 
signature so he could take out a $249,000 home equity loan. He served 
four years in federal prison.

He was released in April 2012.

Ms
 Belford contacted the News-Journal in December and told a reporter she 
had an upcoming court hearing with Matusiewcz to confront him about back
 child support.

'Kids are doing ok. Some lingering issues, as expected, for all of us,' she wrote.
