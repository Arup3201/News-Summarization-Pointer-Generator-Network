Appeal: Brady, who appeared at the tribunal via video-link, wants to be transferred from Ashworth secure hospital back to prison to die

The astonishing £300,000 a year cost 
of keeping Ian Brady in a secure hospital was highlighted yesterday as a
key reason to send him back to jail.

Lawyers for the Moors Murderer said he was merely ‘an elderly, socially isolated man talking to the television’.

They complained the killer had been 
‘tired’ during his self-glorifying four-hour testimony to his mental 
health tribunal on Tuesday and accused the authorities of treating him 
as a ‘special case’ by denying him his wish to die in jail.

The annual bill for keeping the 75-year-old at Ashworth on Merseyside is almost eight times the £40,000 cost for a jail place.

The difference is accounted for mainly
by the army of medical staff. Despite accommodating no more than 228 
patients, Ashworth employs 937 staff, with an annual running cost of 
£67million.

That includes 11 consultants and 649 
nursing staff along with psychiatrists and psychologists, social 
workers, occupational therapists, teachers, physical health care staff, 
chaplains, cooks and cleaners, quite apart from security staff.

Relatives of the five children 
murdered by Brady and Myra Hindley in the 1960s have said the money 
would be better spent tracing the remains of Keith Bennett, which have 
never been found.

In closing submissions yesterday to 
the tribunal, which itself is costing £250,000, his barrister, Nathalie 
Lieven QC, said he suffered from a ‘static’ personality disorder rather 
than mental illness and argued there was ‘no therapeutic benefit’ in 
keeping him in hospital.

She said the psychosis which resulted 
in Brady’s transfer from prison in 1985 had not returned, and claimed 
episodes psychiatrists had classed as hallucinations were no more than 
‘an elderly, socially isolated man talking to the television’.

During his evidence on Tuesday Brady,
who is seeking to be moved back to a normal prison, referred to his 
killings as ‘existential’ and ‘recreational’.

But Miss Lieven said his ‘refusal to 
accept blame’, ‘lack of empathy’ and ‘sense of grandiosity’ could be 
explained by personality disorders which could be addressed in prison.

He would also have been tired from giving evidence at the end of a long tribunal, she added.

The killer also refused to accept that
by eating toast and soup he was no longer meaningfully on the hunger 
strike he began in 1999, a stance Miss Lieven put down to wanting to 
avoid ‘loss of face’.

She also highlighted previous Press 
reports that Brady had a penchant for Creme Eggs as an example of how 
his life at Ashworth was susceptible to leaks.

Miss Lieven argued that Ashworth was 
treating Brady as ‘a special case’, questioning whether it had been 
‘drawn into a battle’ with him and ‘lost perspective’.

‘Is he to be kept for ever in hospital
at massive public expense because of the possibility of a relapse 
despite more than two decades without one?’ she asked.

Victims: Keith Bennett, whose body has never 
been recovered, left, and John Kilbride, right, were two of the 
youngsters killed by Moors murderer Ian Brady during the 1960s

Lured to their deaths: Brady and his partner 
Myra Hindley killed Edward Evans, left, in October 1965. Pauline Reade, 
right, 16, disappeared on her 
way to a disco on July 12, 1963

Eleanor Grey QC, for Ashworth 
Hospital, however, said Brady continued to suffer ‘chronic’ mental 
illness for which he refused therapy, adding that ‘the nature of the 
case of untreated schizophrenia is that it does not vanish’.

Miss Grey also said Brady had not 
given a ‘cogent’ reason for why he wanted to return to prison, instead 
telling anecdotes about being locked up in the 1960s with other 
notorious criminals.

Judge Robert Atherton said the panel hoped to announce its decision by the end of the week.

Along with Hindley – who died in 2002 –
Brady murdered Pauline Reade, 16, John Kilbride, 12, Keith Bennett, 12,
Lesley Ann Downey, ten, and Edward Evans, 17, between 1963 and 1965.

Victims were lured to their deaths, sexually tortured then buried on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester.
