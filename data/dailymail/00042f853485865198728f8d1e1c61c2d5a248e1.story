There are few obvious similarities between superstar Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard and Hull's Scottish keeper Allan McGregor but both share the honour of being penalty perfectionists.

Hazard is understandably confident from the spot, having scored 17 goals from 17 attempts in domestic competition for Chelsea and his previous club Lille - but David Meyler says McGregor is the man to stop the Belgian should he get the chance on Saturday at Stamford Bridge.

The former Rangers keeper has been impenetrable from 12 yards since his move to Hull, saving three penalties starting with Frank Lampard's effort in last season's opener against Chelsea.

Since then he's saved a penalty from QPR's Charlie Austin and last week he was hailed Hull's hero as his stop from West Brom's Graham Dorrans helped Steve Bruce's side salvage a scoreless draw.

While Hazard's record from the dot is impressive, the best in any of Europe's top five leagues, he's faltered in Europe and McGregor's team-mate David Meyler says McGregor could have his number.

'He's a fantastic keeper,' Meyler told The Sun's Graeme Bryce of McGregor, who joined Hull from Besiktas.

It was was not so long ago that McGregor was the subject of Republic of Ireland international Meyler's abuse from the Celtic stands while he was in goal for Rangers.

Meyler's no doubt happy to have the 32-year-old on his side after he famously saved Georgios Samaras's penalty late in the season in 2011 in an undoubted turning point in that year's Scottish title that went the way of Rangers.    

'He's been inspirational since day one ... He works really hard on penalties with our other goalies Steve Harper and Eldin Jakupovic, as well as Gary Walsh our goalkeeping coach.

'They all talk through penalties and go through the information about whatever side we're playing. Allan really studies up on all that stuff and he's clearly doing it well, as the stats prove.'
