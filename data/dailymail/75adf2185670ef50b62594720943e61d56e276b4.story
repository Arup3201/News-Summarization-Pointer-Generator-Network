Brown, who is still on parole following his recent release from jail, had been talking with Knight before the shots were fired.

At around 5:45 a.m. LA time, Brown tweeted about the incident.

'It's disappointing that we as a society can#t have fun or enjoy ourselves without any altercations sometimes. Miss me with the bullsh*t!!!' he tweeted. 

The suspected gunman was apprehended by police, but his identity has not been released.

Roads around the nightclub were immediately sealed off by police, as the nightclub was evacuated, with several partygoers detained for questioning.

Guests at the event had also included singer Justin Bieber and rapper The Game.

Knight, the co-founder of Death Row Records with Dr. Dre and the rapper The D.O.C., is no stranger to the effects of gun violence.

His friend Tupac Shakur was shot multiple times during a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996 - although during a previous visit to 1OAK, Knight told reporters that no one had ever been charged with Shakur's murder because he wasn't really dead, and was instead living on an island.

Knight also suffered a gunshot wound to the leg during a shooting at a 2005 pre-VMA party, hosted by rapper Kanye West.

The Los Angeles branch of 1OAK - which stands for One Of A Kind - is a spin off of the New York club, while there are further branches in Las Vegas and Mexico City.

The club, which bills itself as 'Bringing a New York nightclub experience to Los Angeles' has been open on the famous Sunset Strip since the start of the year and has proved popular with many celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Rihanna.
