She’s the business mogul who transformed Jimmy Choo from a cobbler in Hackney to a multimillion pound global brand adored by A-List celebrities.

You’re no one unless you’ve a pair of ‘Choos,’ and the shoe empire would be nothing without Tamara Mellon.

But with the designer name behind her and an own-brand collection going strong, Tamara says she’s the happiest she has ever been, and credits much of it to her daughter Araminta, 12.

Mellon, 46, who was awarded an OBE in 2010 for her services to the fashion industry, has been open about her very public battles with her mother (the two are still not on speaking terms) and her acrimonious spilt from Jimmy Choo - the brand she built with the designer – in 2007.

In her memoir, In Her Shoes, published last September, Mellon said of her daughter, known as Minty; ‘I was in a very dark and dangerous place and I’m sure the only thing that saved me was Minty.’

And now, as the book is re-released in a paperback version, Mellon reveals the business and life lessons she will pass onto to her daughter.

And despite not even reaching her teenage years yet, Araminta is wasting no time learning the ropes so that she can one day follow in her mother’s own fabulous footsteps.

‘She travels everywhere with me and sits in on all my meetings,’ Mellon tells MailOnline.

‘She’s learning about what I do from osmosis, from actually doing it. And I think that’s the best education. It’s giving her confidence and experience. She’s very smart. If she has an idea, she contributes.’

Mellon
 lives with her daughter in New York, where her business, Tamara Mellon,
 is based – ‘a gorgeous little office on Madison Avenue next to 
Barneys,’ Mellon gushes about her workspace.

Born
 in London in 1967, Tamara was raised between England and California, 
attending two British boarding schools and a finishing school in 
Switzerland. Travelling in the world is as much in her blood as fashion.

She
 continues: ‘My daughter and I bond over the business and decided, 
together, she’s going to travel with me and be in on my meetings.

‘It’s such a great way for us to bond. I love having her with me, I hate leaving her behind.’ 

Whether Minty will take over the reigns from her mother one day is still to be decided, however. ‘It’s a little early still,’ laughs Mellon. ‘But she loves fashion. She’s got strong opinions, which I like.

'It’s very good, though I don’t get a say in what she wears. Unless she asks for my advice, I stay out of it!

‘If there was a stage that she was wearing really inappropriate clothing then I would put my foot down, thankfully we haven’t hit that bridge yet!’

Mellon became Accessories Editor at British Vogue in her early 20s before decamping to set up the Jimmy Choo label.

By the late Nineties, it had become stratospheric; Kate Winslet, Uma Thruman, Julianne Moore and Jennifer Lopez were just a handful of the early A-List supporters.

It became a
 household name after Carrie Bradshaw wore the shoes in Sex And The 
City, and over the course of the series, the brand was mentioned 34 
times.

By
 the end of 2000, Jimmy Choo was turning a profit of around £3m a
 year. There was a London boutique and the brand was represented at 450 
more stores, including Harrods and Selfridges.

The
 relationship between Mellon and Choo, however, was strained - and got worse over the years.

Once the 
business had been sold off to various equity companies, Tamara found the brand she grew from little, was being stretched and moulded into one
 she couldn’t recognise.

'My huge regret was knowing that all the women at Jimmy Choo were underpaid. And not fighting more for that.

‘That’s when my involvement in Jimmy Choo started to dissolve, as it was turning into something I didn’t want it to be. I didn’t like the direction it was going in. It was difficult.’

Going out on her own, after finally leaving Jimmy Choo for good in 2011, was one of the hardest, bravest and most rewarding things Mellon says she has ever done.

‘I had the
 decision: Do I leave now and start again and risk it, or stay, make a 
ton more money and be very safe but not be doing the work I am proud of
 and see my management team treated unfairly?' she says.

‘I just couldn’t do that. It’s about the people and team, not just making money.

‘That
 ethos developed over time, certainly when I had my daughter and as I was 
growing the business and dealing with financial difficulties and private
 equity people.

‘I wanted to motivate and empower women as I went on. I wanted to create a different culture and build a business that really 
supports women and I want Minty to go into a work environment like that 
one day, whatever she decides to do.'

Whilst Tamara Mellon is still in its 'early stages,' says Mellon, she has big plans.

She says: 'My team have to hold the reigns on me! I have 
visions for fragrance and makeup and homewear and swimwear and have 
moodboards on every product category you can imagine.

'We’re still 
building the core business but when I feel that it’s ready I can’t wait 
to expand.'

She adds: ‘When I left Jimmy Choo, I thought it would be very distressing and I’d morn it for a long time.

‘But once my focus was on creating something else, it’s amazing how quickly we move on – so much faster than I thought I would.

‘Jimmy Choo is another life it feels so distant. New focus, and once I’m focused on creating something else, if I’m creating a product then I’m really happy.
