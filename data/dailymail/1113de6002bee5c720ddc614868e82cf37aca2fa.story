A heroin addict and her partner whose two-year-old son died after drinking his mother's methadone at home wept uncontrollably in the dock today as they were jailed for his manslaughter.

Sally Dent, 33, and Shaun Binfield, 45, were found guilty by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court last month over the death of Riley Pettipierre, who died after drinking the heroin substitute last March.

The pair cried today as Dent was sentenced to seven and a half years for her son's manslaughter and her partner Binfield, who is also Riley's father, was jailed for four years on the same charge.

Tragic: Riley Pettipierre, two, of Belper, Derbyshire, died in hospital last March after drinking methadone from a child's beaker that was left on a set of drawers in his parents' home, Nottingham Crown Court heard

The pair had denied the charges, but 
Dent was also found guilty of a separate charge of cruelty to a child 
under the age of 16 for failing to keep methadone out of the reach of 
her child.

Sentencing the couple from Belper, Derbyshire, at court 
this morning, Judge John Milmo QC said: ‘You will both have his death on
your consciences for the rest of your lives.’

The child's green and yellow beaker 
had been placed on a chest of drawers in the couple's bedroom at the 
flat so that Dent could easily drink the methadone if she needed it 
during the night.

The next day Dent awoke to find 
Riley's lifeless body next to her in the bed after he had drunk the 
heroin substitute from the cup.

Dent, who had been addicted to heroin 
since she was 16 and cocaine, called 999 but the toddler's heart had 
stopped beating and his lips were blue when the paramedics arrived.

He 
was pronounced dead shortly after his arrival at hospital. Post-mortem tests showed that Riley had enough methadone in his blood, stomach and urine to prove fatal.

He is believed to have consumed 
between 10ml and 20ml of the heroin substitute, the court heard. Traces 
of cocaine were also found in his hair.

The trial had heard that Dent had been
prescribed methadone to help her get rid of her heroin addiction but 
had struggled to kick the drug.

Today the judge accepted Binfield's 
culpability in Riley's manslaughter was less than his partner's but 
condemned the couple for failing to move the cup out of the toddler's 
reach.

'You will both have his death on your consciences for the rest of your lives'

Judge John Milmo QC

Mr Milmo said: ‘You both knew the 
beaker was in a place to which he had access. Ms Dent showed a reckless 
disregard for the child's safety by asking Shaun Binfield to move it.

‘But you Mr Binfield didn't bother to 
check the next morning whether there was methadone still in the cup at 
the side of the bed.

‘You had the last opportunity to 
protect your son and you failed in that duty. There was no excuse for 
leaving it where Riley could get to it.’

The judge said he had taken into 
consideration that the family had ensured the physical safety of their 
child by installing safety gates around their home and that witnesses 
during the trial had spoke of a well-cared for and clean home.

But Mr Milmo added: ‘If one parent is addicted to Class A drugs, there must be a risk to a child.’

In mitigation, Dent's barrister Simon 
Clarke said the family had tried to minimise Riley's exposure to the 
drug by installing child-proof gates around their home and ensuring 
Binfield looked after the children in a different room while Dent took 
her drugs in the kitchen.

He said Dent would be ‘punished for the rest of her life’ for failing to move the cup.

Defending Binfield, Paul Mann asked the judge to bear in mind the 45-year-old's personal loss when sentencing him.

'You had the last opportunity to protect your son and you failed in that duty. There was no excuse for leaving it where Riley could get to it'

Judge John Milmo QC

He said that Binfield had tried to persuade Dent to get off the drugs during their relationship.

‘Riley was a daddy's boy. They had a close bond. Mr Binfield has lost his son and his liberty,’ Mr Mann told the judge. I ask that you impose punishment measured with a degree of mercy.’

Family and friends sobbed in the 
public gallery as the judge jailed Dent for seven and a half years for 
manslaughter. She was handed a three-year sentence to run concurrently 
for the second charge of cruelty to a child.

Binfield was jailed for four years for manslaughter as the judge said he was satisfied his culpability was less than Dent's.

The pair were told they would serve half their sentences before been released on licence.
