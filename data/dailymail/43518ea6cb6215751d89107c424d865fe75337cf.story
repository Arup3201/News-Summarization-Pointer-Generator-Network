Speaking out: Jacqui Janes, pictured holding a portrait of Jamie, believes parts of her 20-year-old son's body were retained without her permission

A mother whose Guardsman son was killed by a Taliban bomb in Afghanistan has called for an inquiry after discovering parts of his body ‘went missing’ following his return to Britain.

Jacqui Janes believes 20-year-old Jamie’s arms and hands were retained without her permission.

When her son’s coffin was opened so she could take a lock of his hair, she was shocked to discover that his arms and hands had been replaced by padding under his uniform. Yet a post-mortem report mentioned injuries to both arms and hands, and even noted a tattoo of his girlfriend’s name on one arm. 

Mrs Janes, 49, has 
repeatedly raised her concerns with the Ministry of Defence over the 
past three years, but has never received the answers she desperately 
needs.

She has only broken 
her silence now that the Royal Military Police have admitted breaking 
rules and keeping the body parts of other dead soldiers at the John 
Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford – where her own son’s  post-mortem 
examination was held.

When 
Jamie died in 2009, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown famously misspelt 
his name in a handwritten letter of condolence to his mother. But the 
enduring question of why her son’s bomb-damaged hands and arms had been 
removed without permission has caused Mrs Janes far deeper anguish than 
the controversy over Mr Brown’s note. 

Yesterday,
the MoD announced that another soldier from Jamie’s unit, 1st Battalion
Grenadier Guards, was killed in Helmand Province on sentry duty.

Jamie – a soldier from the age of 16 – died on foot patrol in Nad e-Ali, central Helmand, on October 5, 2009, blown up by an improvised explosive device which also wounded three of his colleagues. 

He was pronounced dead after failed resuscitation attempts on a rescue helicopter and at the field hospital at Camp Bastion.

Afterwards, his body was escorted by the military police’s Special Investigations Branch (SIB) from the operating theatre to the mortuary at Camp Bastion and on his repatriation flight to Britain, arriving on the morning of October 9. Once his body had been repatriated at RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire on the same day, it was transported by the SIB to the John Radcliffe Hospital.

The Mail on Sunday has seen documents confirming that a Sergeant Griffin of the SIB accompanied the remains in a sealed bag which was opened at the hospital and identified to Warrant Officer Andrew Bishop, of the SIB’s Forensic Department.   The body was stored in a secure refrigerator, awaiting a post-mortem examination by Home Office pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt.

Dr Hunt’s report of October 12, 2009 – seen by this newspaper –recorded multiple wounds and referred to Jamie’s hands and left arm being badly ‘disrupted’ – a medical term meaning the normal shape had been altered after layers of tissue were blown apart.

And in his ‘descriptions’ he makes note of ‘a tattoo which appeared to read “Kelly” running vertically down the outer aspect of the left upper arm’. There were also mentions of injuries to forearms, elbows, wrists and fingers.

Afterwards, Jamie’s body was photographed and routine DNA tests carried out. On October 16, SIB officers took the body to Albin International, a repatriation and funeral company contracted by the MoD.

There, Jamie was dressed in his ceremonial red tunic, white gloves and black boots. On October 19, Mrs Janes was driven to a London chapel of rest to see her son’s body for the first time, but she only glimpsed his head and shoulders as the coffin lid was only moved partway. Afterwards, his coffin was screwed shut.

Shocking discovery: Jacqui Janes asked for her son's coffin to be opened when his body was taken to this Brighton funeral home, it was there she discovered his limbs were missing

She then drove in convoy with the undertakers from Albin’s chapel of rest to a local firm, Caring Lady of Hove. Wanting to take a lock of her son’s hair, Mrs Janes asked undertaker Angela Spencer to unscrew the casket lid.  

Mrs Janes, who has another son currently serving in Afghanistan, says when she looked inside Jamie’s coffin his hands and arms had ‘disappeared’. Her account is supported by Mrs Spencer. 

In the front room of Mrs Janes’s terraced home in Portslade in Brighton, on the edge of the South Downs, photographs of Jamie in his uniform are all around and his beret, medals and ceremonial belt hold pride of place in a glass case. 

On the coffee table, piles of documents attest to her three-year battle for answers from the MoD. ‘I wanted to bury all of Jamie,’ she said.

‘I think parts of him have been dumped somewhere. This is horrific, shocking. I won’t rest until I find out what they’ve done to him.’

How did the scandal of soldiers’ retained body parts come to light?An MoD whistleblower contacted the media to claim that at least 60 items of human tissue and major body parts of soldiers killed in Afghanistan were being illegally kept against the rules of the forensic department by the Royal Military Police Special Investigation Branch, both at their HQ and  Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital. 

What does the law say?Under the Human Tissue Act 2006, it is illegal to remove, store or use human tissue without consent, or to store tissue or organs for a purpose not stated. Penalties include a fine and up to three years in jail.

Why was the Act brought in? The organ-retention scandal at Liverpool’s Alder Hey children’s hospital in 1999 brought issues such as consent and tissue use and storage under the spotlight. It became apparent that existing laws needed updating.

Are the rules different for soldiers’ bodies?Post-mortem examinations on members of the Armed Forces killed in combat are carried out under the jurisdiction of a Home Office coroner. Tissue samples required as part of the investigation are retained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. The samples must be stored on behalf of the coroner until an investigation is complete and written instructions on the relatives’ wishes are received.

What action has the  MoD taken? The MoD has refused to reveal if anyone has been disciplined over the scandal but says it has contacted the families involved to inform them and apologise.

Mrs Janes’s doubts began as soon as Jamie was flown home. She said: ‘I was introduced to a lot of officers at Jamie’s repatriation ceremony at RAF Lyneham. I asked a lot of questions, about the incident and the state of Jamie’s body.

‘Eventually, they told me he had lost his legs but that he had arms and hands. They seemed very awkward speaking to me.

‘As we got closer to the funeral, I was getting more and more suspicious about what had happened to Jamie and what state he was in. Jamie’s officers were being evasive so I wanted to see for myself.

‘I also wanted a lock of his hair. So I asked Angela if she would unscrew the coffin, we could cut off some hair and check the body ourselves.

‘Angela removed the lid of the coffin and felt down Jamie’s arms and looked inside his gloves as I was standing next to her. There was padding where Jamie’s arms and hands should have been. She said: “Jacqui, I am sorry. I would like to tell you his parts are there but they are not.” ’

Mrs Spencer confirmed: ‘By feel and looking, I could tell there weren’t any limbs there. Removing parts of the body should not be part of the preparing or embalming process.’

Mrs Janes added: ‘I was devastated, as any mother would have been. What had they done with the rest of his body? I rang all the officers from Jamie’s battalion but I didn’t get any answers.

‘I received the post-mortem report in March 2010 and was horrified. What had happened to Jamie’s hands after they were inspected by Dr Hunt? I rang his office but I was told he was unwell.

‘Then I was watching the news  last week and I heard that the  Special Investigation Branch had been caught out retaining body tissue at the John Radcliffe Hospital, where Jamie was examined, and I thought: I am going to speak out publicly. I am not going to wait any longer for answers. As his mother, I am entitled to be told, even if it is an entirely appropriate process. What happened to these bits of him?’

A spokesman for the MoD said: ‘The MoD is dealing with this case as a matter of urgency and an investigation has been launched. Our foremost concern is always to support the families of the deceased and our thoughts and concerns remain with them. We make sure the return home of all our fallen comrades to their families is conducted with the utmost dignity and respect.’

The Mail on Sunday tried to contact Dr Hunt, but he was on holiday. A colleague  at the Forensic Pathology Services said: ‘We spend a lot of time ensuring where possible that all body parts are repatriated with the deceased for burial or cremation. We certainly would not just throw body parts away.

A spokesman for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the John Radcliffe, said: ‘Forensic post-mortem examinations  on members of the Armed Forces killed in combat are undertaken under the jurisdiction of a Home Office coroner.

‘Tissue samples are stored in an entirely secure and respectful manner until no longer required by the coroner . . . and the families have expressed their wishes.’

A spokesman for Albin International declined to comment ‘due to the terms of our MoD contract’.

Gorden Brown managed to turn a humanitarian gesture into a political catastrophe when he handwrote a letter of condolence to Mrs Janes in 2009.

The then Prime Minister’s note was full of spelling errors, and most notably it began: ‘Dear Mrs James.’

He also spelt Jamie incorrectly and corrected it by writing over the last letter. The other mistakes were: Greatst for greatest, condolencs for condolences, you instead of your, and colleagus for colleagues. 

All PMs write to the next-of-kin of fallen troops but Mr Brown’s effort fuelled claims that he was being irreverent to Britain’s forces. At the time, Mrs Janes said: ‘It’s just disrespectful.’
