These pictures show the vile conditions inside a fried chicken shop that was closed down.

Describing QFC in East London as one of the filthiest inspectors had ever seen, Waltham Forest council released the pictures to act as a warning to other takeaways.

As well as having grease and left over chips strewn across the floor, the shop in Wood Street, also had a mouse infestation.

One Waltham Forest council environmental health officer described the takeaway as 'the filthiest premises I have seen in a long time'

Councillor Clyde Loakes who sanctioned the release of the pictures said: 'It begs the question, what does the Q in QFC stand for?

‘Queasy? Questionable? Certainly not Quality, that’s for sure! In all seriousness, the photos I have seen connected with this inspection tell a pretty disgusting tale.

‘It is truly shocking
to find businesses like this that have an utter disregard for the 
health and well being of their customers.'

QFC was closed down on November 18 immediately after inspectors arrived to check food hygiene practices in the business.

Within two days a Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Order was secured from Stratford Magistrates’ Court.

The shop will now only be allowed to re-open if health and safety officers deem it to no longer be a risk to customers.

The shop has now been shut down and will not be able to trade unless environmental health officers deem it fit to serve food
