The only thing protecting Earth from a 'city-killer'-sized asteroid has been 'blind luck', according to former astronaut Ed Lu.

But despite the serious nature of the threat, a recent report claims Nasa's efforts to protect the Earth has fallen short.

The space agency won't meet its goal to find 90 percent of potentially dangerous asteroids larger than 460ft (140 metres) in diameter, the agency's Inspector General said.

Nasa won't meet its goal to find 90 percent of potentially dangerous asteroids larger than 460ft (140 metres) in diameter, the agency's Inspector General said

The shortfall comes despite a 10-fold increase in Nasa's annual asteroid budget over the past five years - from $4 million ($2.47 million) in 2009 to $40 million ($24.7 million) in 2014.

The money was set aside to track and assess potentially dangerous asteroids and comets, or so-called 'Near-Earth Objects' (NEOs), that fly within about 28 million miles (45 million km) of Earth.

The agency's efforts are poorly coordinated, ill-managed and under-staffed, according to a 32-page report.

The report, titled 'Nasa's Efforts to Identify Near-Earth Objects and Mitigate Hazards,' was led by Nasa's Inspector General Paul Martin.

This graphic shows the orbits of all the known Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), numbering over 1,400 as of early 2013. These are the asteroids considered hazardous because they are fairly large (at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size), and because they follow orbits that pass close to the Earth's orbit

Humanity, says Brian Cox, is at risk of being wiped out by asteroids – and we’re not taking the threat seriously.

‘There is an asteroid with our name on it and it will hit us,’ Professor Cox told MailOnline. In fact, the Earth had a ‘near-miss’ only a few months ago.

‘We didn’t see it,’ says the 46-year-old physicist. ‘We saw it on the way out, but if it had just been a bit further over it would have probably wiped us out. These things happen.’

The bus-sized asteroid, named 2014 EC, came within 38,300 (61,637km) miles of Earth in March - around a sixth of the distance between the moon and our planet.

No one really knows when a serious impact could happen. ‘It could be tomorrow,’ Professor Cox said. ‘The thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it.’

But ideas such as this aren’t progressing fast enough, he claims. ‘I think its human stupidity we need to worry about. ‘It’s the way we behave, but also just the way we don’t accumulate knowledge at the rate that we could.’

‘We just don’t. I mean, you can see it by the figures. We spend virtually as much on it as everyone else, which is sod all.’

'Nasa estimates that it has identified only about 10 percent of all asteroids 460ft (140 metres) and larger,' Mr Martin wrote.

'Given its current pace and resources, [Nasa] has stated that it will not meet the goal of identifying 90 per cent of such objects by 2020.'

A one-person office manages a 'loosely structured conglomerate of research activities that are not well integrated and (which) lack overarching program oversight, objectives and established milestones to track progress,' the report said.

Nasa has found about 95 per cent of the largest and potentially most destructive asteroids, those measuring about 0.62 mile (1 km) or larger in diameter.

About 66 million years ago, a 6.2-mile (10-km) -wide object hit what is now Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, triggering global climate changes that are believed to have led to the demise of the dinosaurs.

More recently, a fragment of an asteroid estimated to be just 59ft (18 meters) in diameter exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia.

The force of the explosion last year matched the energy released in 30 atomic bombs, blowing out windows and destroying buildings.

More than 1,000 people were injured by flying debris.

'Recent research suggests that Chelyabinsk-type events occur every 30 to 40 years,' the Office of Inspector General report said, adding that most impacts would occur in the ocean rather than in populated areas.

The aftermath of Chelyabinsk. Although Nasa is monitoring the skies, no one really knows when a serious impact could happen. As of July 2014, the agency has discovered about 11,230 NEOs, including 862 of the largest asteroids

Since 1998, Nasa has spent about $100 million (£61.6 million) on programmes to find, assess and mitigate potentially threatening space neighbours.

As of July 2014, the agency has discovered about 11,230 NEOs, including 862 of the largest asteroids.

That figure includes only about 10 per cent of the smaller nearby asteroids that are about 460 ft (140 meters) wide, far short of the agency's goal to find 90 percent by 2020, the report said.

The report made five recommendations for improving up Nasa's asteroid detection efforts, including adding at least four to six employees to help manage the program and coordinating projects with other U.S. and international agencies and with privately funded initiatives.

Nasa's Associate Administrator for Science John Grunsfeld said in a letter to Mr Martin he expects a new NEO program to be in place by September 2015.
