Vulnerable patients are to be given control of taxpayers' money to fund their own treatment under new plans to save money and keep them out of hospitals, the head of the NHS said.

NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens told the Guardian that from April the elderly, disabled children, the mentally ill and those with learning difficulties will be able to control budgets to spend on carers, physiotherapists and psychotherapy sessions.

The paper reported that most patients on the scheme are likely to get more than £1,000 from health service and local government coffers, with some with complex requirements receiving larger sums, though they will all retain the right to free GP and hospital care.

NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has revealed plans for vulnerable patients to be given control of taxpayers' money to fund their own treatment to save money and keep them out of hospitals

Mr Stevens said more than five million people could be using the system by 2018, funded by 'billions' of pounds of public money.

He wants to use it to improve the quality of care the four groups receive, which is currently fragmented and has been hit badly by local authority funding cuts.

He said: 'We are going to set out the biggest offer to bring health and social care together that there's been since 1948 - a new option for combining them at the level of the individual.'

Patients would not receive money directly under the plan, but would be able to control how it is spent after agreeing a care plan with their doctors.

Mr Stevens took over the £189,900 post as head of the health service in April, replacing Sir David Nicholson.

He will outline his plan in a speech to the Local Government Association conference in Bournemouth today.

The plans provoked widespread support from charities but experts urged the Government to ensure patients' are armed with the right information to make the right decisions for their needs.

A spokesman for the Alzheimer's Society welcomed the news.

He said: 'Pooling health care personal budgets is a massive step forward for integrated health and care for people living with dementia.

'The current system is fragmented, in many cases not user-friendly and often failing to need the needs and expectations of an ageing population.

'Managing health and social care in silos is simply letting people with dementia down.

‘For this ambition to become a reality we need to fix the structural problems of the system.

'One in three people over the age of 65 will develop dementia so their needs must be at the core of the NHS and social care system.’

And Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, added: 'Personal budgets will empower patients and give people more control of their options in health and social care.

'However, in order for these reforms to be truly effective, it's critical the Government provides quality information and advice so people can make the right decisions for their needs.'
