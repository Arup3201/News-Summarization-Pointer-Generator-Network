A Tomahawk missile managed to punch a hole all the way through a moving ship, paving the way for the US Navy to improve its use of long range weapons on moving targets.

A test of the explosive off San Nicolas Island in California showed the missile ploughing through a shipping container attached to a moving ship with such force that it punched a hole and emerged on the other side to bounce along the surface of the water.

If the Navy can perfect the technique to launch the missile this could give an almost 1,000 nautical mile extension to its fleet of guided destroyers and solve a current problem with a lack of long range anti-surface missiles, USNI reported.

A Tomahawk missile punched a hole all the way through a shipping container attached to a moving ship as it was tested off the coast of California, and could pave the way to improve the Navy's missile fleet 

'This success further demonstrates the existing capability of Tomahawk as a netted weapon, and in doing so, extends its reach beyond fixed and re-locatable points to moving targets,' Captain Joe Mauser, Tomahawk Weapons System (PMA-280) program manager for Naval Air Systems Command, said in a statement. 

The Tomahawk Block IV – unlike earlier versions of the missile – has the ability to adjust its flight path based on new information given to the missile allowing it to hit moving targets.

Unclassfied video footage of a Raytheon Tomahawk missile test in January was obtained by USNI news. It shows the explosive being launched from a guided missile destroyer USS Kidd. 

The missile is fired powerfully into the air in a plume of smoke and travels considerable distance before it is seen punching through a container.

In an unclassified video the missile is shown heading for the red metal shipping container as it moves

The explosive then emerges out of the other side and bounces along the surface of the ocean.

A previous tomahawk missile with a 200 nautical mile range was previously developed by the Navy in the 1980s, but there was a lack of technology to control it or ensure it hit the correct target.

Due to its limited success and the danger of hitting friendly or neutral ships, the missiles were developed into land attack tomahawks. 

Video footage shows the missile being fired, at long range, from USS Kidd, in the middle of the ocean 

As the missile tears through the air it hones in on the metal shipping container out at sea 

It is hoped the successful test could pave the way for missiles to be used to boost the American navy's fleet

Success of the test means the US Navy could be able to use the Tomahawk missile in future to improve use of long range weapons on moving targets
