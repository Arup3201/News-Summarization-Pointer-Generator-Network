The family of Private Cheryl James, 18, pictured, died from a single gunshot wound to the head at Deepcut Army Barracks in Surrey in 1995

A female soldier was subjected to sexual violence before her death at Deepcut Army base in November 1995, it has been claimed. 

Private Cheryl James was one of four soldiers who died of gunshot wounds at the base between 1995 and 2002.

The 18-year-old recruit suffered a single gunshot wound to her head. 

An army investigation ruled that Pte James took her own life, while a coroner returned an open verdict just three weeks after her death. 

Now Pte James' family want a new inquest following the discovery of new evidence which could provide a different explanation for the tragedy.

Last July, the family were successful being granted a new inquest, but the hearing his being delayed by Surrey Police.  

The family's legal team claim that new ballistics evidence as well as claims of bullying and sexual violence in the weeks leading up to Pte James' death. 

The 18-year-old from Llangollen, Denbigshire, north Wales died on November 27, 1995. She suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, with the bullet entering between her right eye and the bridge of her nose. 

Ballistics experts claim that it is highly unlikely that the bullet wound suffered by Pte James could have been self inflicted. 

Just five months before Pte James' death, Private Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex was discovered with five bullet wounds to his chest. 

The army maintained that Pte Benton took his own life in June 1995, despite ballistics evidence suggesting that only one of the five rounds was discharged at close range. 

In September 2001, Private Geoff Gray, 17, from East London suffered two gunshot wounds to the head while on guard duty.

On March 23, 2002, Private James Collison, also 17, was found with a single gunshot wound to the chin. 

Once again the army insisted that another young recruit had taken their own life.

Although the families of the dead soldiers believe that authorities are trying to cover up the real cause of the deaths. 

During the most recent hearing, Alison Foster QC told the High Court: 'We will present shocking details which will pertain only to this girl. 

Private Sean Benton 

The 20-year-old of Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead at Deepcut with five bullet wounds to his chest in June 1995. Despite ballistics tests suggesting only one bullet was fired from close range and the others from a distance, the Army says he committed suicide.

Private Cheryl James

The 18-year-old of Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a single bullet wound to her head at the barracks in November 1995. An Army inquiry concluded she committed suicide while a coroner records an open verdict three weeks after her death.

Private Geoff Gray

The young recruit,17, from Hackney, east London, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head while on night guard duty in September 2001. Five shots had been fired and the other three bullets were not found. A coroner records an open verdict after hearing that a figure was seen running away from the area.

Private James Collinson

The 17-year-old, from Perth, was found dead with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin while on night guard duty at the barracks in March 2002. The Army says he killed himself, but his parents do not accept this, insisting he had been happy. An inquest in February 2006 recorded an open verdict

'We will be looking at the circumstances surrounding Cheryl's death including ballistics, harassment and sexual violence towards her.' 

Pte James' family want to have their daughter's body exhumed for a new examination which they hope prove that the young recruit did not take her own life. 

The 20-year-long legal battle is being supported by Liberty.

Pte James' family are anxious that the new inquest into their daughter's death is opened as quickly as is reasonably possible. 

But Surrey Police want the inquiry delayed as the families of the three other recruits may wish to reopen their inquests. 

Pte James had been stationed at the controversial Deepcut Barracks near Frimley in Surrey for just 11 days at the time of her death as part of the Royal Logistics Corps.

She was found on November 27, 1995 at 8.30am near her guard post. 

The was armed with a standard-issue SA80 rifle. 

Surrey Police conducted their own investigation into the death which formed part of a 44-volume case file. 

It included statements, documents, notes, photographs and forensic evidence. 

Liberty successfully managed to force Surrey Police, using the Human Rights Act, to hand over the dossier, which is central to the latest legal bid. 

Emma Norton, Legal Officer for Liberty, said: 'Cheryl died in 1995. Surrey Police held onto all the sensitive material about Cheryl’s death, refusing to hand it over to the family until 2012 – and then only under threat of litigation using the Human Rights Act.

'The content of the disclosure is shocking and it was on the basis of that evidence that the High Court ordered a fresh inquest.

'After almost 20 years her case is finally ready to proceed. 

'That it should now be Surrey Police – again – that is standing in the way of the investigation by asking for the case to be delayed is deeply upsetting to Cheryl’s parents.' 

An independent investigation into the four deaths published in 2006 found 'clear evidence of found abuse', 'institutional failings' and a 'culture of intimidation' at Deepcut Barracks. 

But the report, which had been commissioned by the Ministry of Defence found that Pte James and her comrades had not been 'bullied to death' and had probably taken their own lives.

Last July, Mr Justice Mitting and Judge Peter Thorton granted permission for a new inquest into Pte James' death. 

After reviewing the most recent evidence, they agreed there had been 'an insufficiency of inquiry' during the 1995 inquest and quashed the open verdict. 

Judge Thornton added: 'The discovery of new facts or evidence made a fresh investigation including a fresh inquest necessary or desirable in the interests of justice.'

A spokeswoman for Surrey Police said: 'Surrey Police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into the circumstances in which Pte Cheryl James died. 

'The Force continues to provide voluntary disclosure of documents relating to Pte James and has as a dedicated team to complete this as quickly and effectively as possible. 

'At a pre inquest review on February 27th, His Honour Justice Barker was asked to consider the merits of holding any new inquests arising from the deaths of Pte Cheryl James, Pte Sean Benton, Pte Geoff Gray and Pte James Collinson, together or individually. 

'This was raised as a matter for consideration and Surrey Police will fully support the coronial process. Our thoughts remain with the family of Pte James.'
