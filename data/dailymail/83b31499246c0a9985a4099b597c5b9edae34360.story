With the cost of watching live football rising every year, one owner of a club is instead offering to pay fans to come through the turnstiles.

Jamie Waltham, 33, the owner and manager of newly formed non-league Hull United AFC, says he will give £2 to everyone that comes to watch his team play their first home game.

He said that many people in the city feel priced out of watching their much bigger rival Hull City in the Premier League so he wanted to offer an alternative.

Generous: Jamie Waltham has offered £2 to everyone who comes to the next Hull United home game

'Everyone in Hull is really proud of what Hull City have achieved,' he said.

'But I speak to a lot of people who feel priced out and prices go through the roof when you are in the best league in the world.

'I’ve felt for a long time we needed a top non-league club and that’s our goal. Hull City started a long time ago by people playing at a similar level of football so I see this as the beginning of a journey for us and the fans that come along.

'I’m offering £2 to everyone that comes through the door, but if people come in and spend £4-5 then we could make a bit of money. We are doing pints of beer for £2, food at discounted prices and we want it to be as affordable as possible.

'If 500 people come through the door then I’ll pay out £1,000 because I feel that sometimes you have to give before you get back. It’s about offering an alternative and an incentive to come down and watching something a little bit different.'

Club runner: The 33-year-old is the owner and manager of the newly-formed non-league side

Having bought the ground Dene Park, Mr Waltham is confident that in five years time they will be a well established non-league team and has set his sights on eventually joining the Football League.

And his aim started well as they won their first game of the season last weekend away from home, beating Hessle Rangers 3-0.

He said: 'If we get five promotions then we will be in the conference so in five years time I want us to be a top non-league club. And then I believe the goal for a top non-league club should be to become a league club.

'If you don’t have that set in your sights from the start you will never get to it.'
