Cats are notorious for being rescued from trees but this Sydney kitten experienced a death-defying ride in the wheel arch of a car and now has an extraordinary tale to tell.

Firefighters were called to a car park in Greenacre in western Sydney on Monday afternoon to rescue a frightened kitten after the driver heard strange noises coming from under his car.

The man had been driving for 25 minutes on his way home from work when he decided to stop and investigate the sound.

This little kitten had to be rescued by firefighters after he was found in the wheel of a car in Sydney on Monday

When he realised it was a trapped kitten, he promptly called in the professionals.

Fire crews found the kitten huddled in the space between the wheel arch and the mudguard area.

Rory Richardson from Lakemba Fire Station saved the distressed animal and took it back to the station to feed it.

The kitten, now named Rory after his rescuer, has taken up residency at the RSPCA's Yagoona shelter until a new owner is found.

'She's very bubbly and very vocal and very lively,' Dr Angela Sun from the RSPCA told Nine News. 

Mr Richardson is quickly earning a reputation for his feline rescue missions - this is his second successful cat rescue in less than two years on the job.
