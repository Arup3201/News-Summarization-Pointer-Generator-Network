One of two people charged with enslaving a mentally disabled woman for two years with her child denied on Wednesday that she hurt the woman or locked her inside a filthy basement room.

Jessica Hunt told jurors that she tried to help the woman care for her daughter and blamed two others who already pleaded guilty and testified against her and her boyfriend.

'I was not doing bad things to her,' Hunt said in federal court.

An FBI affidavit says Dezerah Silsby, 21, admitted she used ice cream to lure the woman and her daughter from their relative's house to captivity

Jessica Hunt, 31, and Jordie Callahan, 26 are accused of keeping Shannon Eckley as a slave for two years - threatening her and milking her of government benefits

Hunt and Jordie Callahan have pleaded
 not guilty to charges accusing them of raiding the woman's bank account
 and public assistance and forcing her to cooperate through sexual and 
physical abuse.

Prosecutors said Mentally-disabled Shannon Eckley and 
her five-year-old daughter were held in modern-day slavery - they allegedly were threatened with a python and pit bulls while being forced 
to live in a damp, dark basement with a lock on the door and no bathroom
 in the northern Ohio town of Ashland. They said the ordeal lasted from 
early 2011 to late 2012.

The two victims were kept her in a 
room with a free-ranging iguana and were ordered to feed the reptile 
fruits and vegetables her daughter was denied, according to court 
papers.

'The living conditions were simply subhuman,' said Steven Dettelbach, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio.

Threats: The suspects are accused of threatening to make their snakes and their pit bulls attack Eckley and her daughter if she didn't do their bidding

The
 mother and daughter were sometimes forced to eat dog food, according to
 a law enforcement source with first-hand knowledge of the 
investigation.

They were also frequently denied access to the bathroom.

The two people who pleaded guilty earlier in the forced-labor case are scheduled for sentencing this month.

Dezerah
 Silsby, who was accused of using ice cream to lure the woman and her 
child to captivity, entered a plea under the terms of a sealed 
agreement. She earlier testified that she drove the woman and Hunt to an
 ATM to get money using the woman's government funds debit card.

Hunt
 said that the woman gave her the debit card because she didn't have a 
purse to keep it and that she never ordered her to give it up.

The
 woman volunteered to injure herself, Hunt said, to help the defendants 
obtain pain pills. Hunt said Silsby slammed the woman's hand in a door 
and then smashed her hand with a rock before she went to a hospital to 
get the medicine.

'I didn't tell her to do that, and she offered me the pills,' Hunt said.

Hunt also said she told the woman that she could leave any time.

The Ashland case has dark similarities to last month's revelation in Cleveland that three women had been keep captive for a decade

Daniel Brown is accused of aiding Hunt and Callahan

Police
 first got involved when the woman was arrested on a candy bar 
shoplifting case and asked to be jailed because people had been mean to 
her.

Authorities said 
the abuse allegation was a ruse complete with a video staged by the 
suspects. They said the suspects had forced the woman to act as if she 
were mistreating her child.

The
 woman later pleaded guilty to child endangering and was sentenced in 
February to about five months in jail. She served only part of that 
sentence.

Between May 
2011 and October 2012, Eckley and her daughter were locked in the 
basement of an apartment in Ashland, Ohio, and forced to do housework 
and look after Hunt's four children.

All the while, Callahan and Hunt stole her government benefits and used the money on themselves, authorities say.

Eckley's enslavement bears chilling 
similarity to the case of Ariel Castro, the man who was charged last 
month with kidnapping three woman and keeping them against their will in
 his house for ten years while he repeatedly raped, beat and emotionally
 tortured them.

Castro's house of horrors is located in Cleveland, Ohio, 65miles northeast of Ashland.

Federal charges allege Callahan and Hunt also repeatedly beat Eckley and her toddler daughter.

When they were not beating them to keep them in line, they used their pets.

The pair kept a poisonous coral snake, a ball python and a Burmese python that weighed 130 pounds as well as lizards, spiders, scorpions and 'numerous' dogs - including pit bulls.

The pair used these pets to terrify and menage Eckley and her young daughter - threatening to turn them loose on the captives if they didn't behave.

Callahan allegedly used dogs to threaten Eckley, as well

Callahan posted numerous photos on 
his Facebook page of he and Hunt handling the creatures. One picture 
shows a snake coiled around a rat. Another shows Callahan apparently 
feeding a live chicken to his massive Burmese python.

Callahan also allegedly used a gun to threaten Eckley on one occasion, as well.

Callahan
 and Hunt invited Eckley and her daughter to come live with them in May 
2011. Authorities allege she arrived in a living hell. Once she moved 
in, the pair began treating her as a slave.

They
 initially locked her in the basement and forced her to sleep on the 
concrete floor without a mattress. They deprived her of food - while 
lavishing attention on their animals.

The pair allegedly harvested the money Eckley received from government benefits and used the money for themselves. They also used her to get drugs.

In December 2011, Callahan allegedly bashed Eckley's hand with a rock. He then took her to a doctor - leaving her child at the apartment - and told her to request a prescription for Valium. Once she got the narcotics, Callahan and Hunt used them for themselves.

They executed the stunt a second time, as well. On that occasion, Callahan kicked Eckley in the hip.

Brown is accused of aiding Callahan and Hunt by allegedly catching Eckley when she tried to escape. Authorities say he lied to her and said he would help her when he saw her outside the apartment.

The couple also allegedly sent Eckley to the store to run errands, though they always kept kept her daughter at the house.

In October 2012, on one of her trips to the store, Eckley was arrested for shoplifting after stealing a candy bar - and that's when the alleged house of horrors was .
