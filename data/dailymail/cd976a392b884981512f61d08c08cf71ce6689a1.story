A map showing the types of retail stores that are most popular in each US state has been compiled.

The survey reveals that car battery retailers are the store of choice in five states, including Texas and Ohio.

The data, compiled by Yelp and Huffington Post, compared online business listings with the national prevalence of different types of stores.

By doing this, the survey was able to list the 10 types of store most 'disproportionately common' in each state - or the businesses that appear most often when compared with the national average.

A new map showing the types of retail stores that are most likely to appear in each US state has been released. Car battery shops were the most commonly found in five states, including Kansas, Georgia, Maryland, Ohio and Texas

The list includes everything from the best state to find brewing supplies to where to go for best chance of buying fireworks.  

It is unsurprising that Alaska has a higher proportion of knitting suppliers and Florida has 602 per cent more swimwear shops than the average state. 

But there were other, less obvious results. For example, Alabama and Indiana came out best known for having more flea markets than anywhere else.

Colorado had nearly 620 per cent more billiard shops and South Dakota is the place to go for art galleries.

The data compares online business listings to the number of those businesses nationally. It looks at everything from brewing supplies to fireworks (pictured)
