Carnival Cruise Lines year lurches from bad to worse with the news the FBI is investigating the mysterious death of an 18-year-old high school senior board a Caribbean voyage returning to New York.

Seth Younes died on the last night of a Carnival Cruise in the early house of Tuesday morning

Initial reports have speculated that Seth Younes, from New York, died after becoming extremely drunk on the last night of the eight day cruise, although where and how he began drinking is not yet clear.

A Carnival Cruise Lines spokesman confirmed that Younes died on board one of their vessels at around 3 a.m. on Tuesday but denied that he was served alcohol by any staff member of the embattled firm.

In an emailed statement to The 
Saratogian, Vance Gulliksen said the cause of Younes’ death has not yet 
been determined, but 'with regard to speculation that he may have died 
from alcohol poisoning, we can confirm that, based on the preliminary 
investigation, there is no indication he was served any alcohol by 
shipboard personnel.'

The
New York City Medical Examiner's Office have said that the teens 
autopsy had proved inconclusive and that further testing including 
toxicology was required.

And
the FBI have confirmed that they are investigating the tragic death to 
determine whether a crime was committed and if so, by whom.

Younes
was on the eight-day cruise with his family, which departed New York 
February on 18th bound for the Bahamas and died in his cabin according 
to Gullisken.

An 
individual posting on the Cruise Critic forum online claiming to be related to Younes has said that the boy was intoxicated prior to his 
death.

'This 18 YO happens to be my husbands cousins child,' said the poster who uses the name TRESE online.

It has been claimed the 18-year-old was away from his parents drinking and died in his cabin after falling asleep

'The parents were asleep and figured their 18 YO son was fine being out of the room. He DID get very drunk...was brought back to his room, and had trouble breathing.'

She added, 'The family is not blaming anyone for this tragedy.'

'All I know is security called the parents, told them their son was drunk and they needed to come get him. They took him to the infirmary and the nurse said there's two things they could do.

'Either leave him there and be charged or take him to your room and watch him. Either way, he will wake up tomorrow with a hangover. They chose to take him to the room.

'He fell asleep, snoring,,,,then suddenly had trouble breathing, gasping for air. Parents called the emergency number and started CPR. His step-dad is a Saratoga firefighter.

'He continued for 30 minutes, exhausted, it took that long for emergency personnel to show up. They started CPR as well and Seth never came back.

Seth Younes' classmates at Saratoga Springs High School spoke of their shock when told of his death on Wednesday

'It truly is a tragedy and now his parents are making funeral arrangements for a kid who had a great future.'

According to J. Peter Donald in the New York field 
office of the FBI, the Bureau is investigating the death, but would not 
comment on the cause of death.

'That is part of what we're investigating,' Donald told Cruise Critic.

Classmates of Younes, were stunned to hear of the news.

'He was one of my good buddies, an outstanding person,' said classmate Craig Smith.

'If you were having a bad day and you were talking to Seth, he would make you laugh. His smile was contagious and there’s just not a bad thing to say about him.'

Other students also recalled his friendly disposition.

'Seth was one of the friendliest people I had the pleasure of meeting,' said Megan Stevens, a member of the class of 2012.

'Even if he didn’t know someone that well, he treated them like a friend regardless.'

February has been a difficult month for Carnival Cruises. Earlier in the month the Carnival Triumph liner broke down in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,000 people on board.

Passengers and crew had to endure terrible and unsanitary conditions as toilets began leaking and some were forced to use plastic bags to go to the bathroom.

And in the days after the ill-fated Carnival cruise ship returned to Mobile, Alabama on February 14th, guests spoke of the gruesome ordeal after enduring five days of overflowing toilets, mushy floors, food shortages and stomach-churning odors.

Passengers described to relatives and the media via cellphone the conditions on board the Triumph where cabins had raw sewage running down the walls and interior passages sloshed with waste.

Last resort: The urinals were covered up and trash cans lined with plastic bags for people to use for bathrooms on board the luxury liner

Squalor: Many of the passengers on board the Carnival Triumph immediately took pictures of the horrible conditions on board once they had charged smartphones and cameras

Passenger Kendall Jenkins, a 24-year-old self-employed property manager from Houston, Texas said conditions on board the ship were ‘like the Hunger Games' as guests looked out for themselves and hoarded food.

Rian Tipton, a 29-year-old from Chicago who was on a bachelorette party with her girlfriends, told People that some passengers ignored the general rule imposed of defecating in a biohazard bag.

She said: '[There] are people who just don't follow the rules, so they either go in their toilets or in the public restrooms.

'Toilets started to overflow and so were the trash cans! People were literally peeing and pooping in the trash cans.

She added: 'The worst that I've heard is people going into the public bathrooms and seeing feces on the wall.'

Ms Tipton was one of many passengers who described a gut-wrenching stench on parts of the ship and complained that toilets and drainpipes overflowed.

Foul: Passengers were reduced to going to the bathroom in biohazard bags and placing excrement outside their cabins in the hallways

Grim: Passengers did their best in the condition on board by keeping waste outside the cabins but the smell was described as unbearable by those on board

'The stench was awful,' said Robin Chandler, a 50-year-old from Dallas who spent her birthday on the ship. 'A lot of people were crying and freaking out.'

Jacob Combs, an Austin, Texas-based sales executive with a healthcare and hospice company, praised the ship's crew.

'Just imagine the filth,' said Combs, 30. 'People were doing crazy things and going to the bathroom in sinks and showers.

'It was inhuman. The stewards would go in and clean it all up. They were constantly cleaning.'

One woman who was on the arduous voyage told ABC: 'Our toilet just sort of exploded and we've been on the balcony ever since.'

Some passengers said conditions deteriorated rapidly on the Triumph earlier in the week.

One passenger Norma Reyes told reporters waiting on shore that the hallways were 'toxic'.

There were reports of people getting sick and passengers being told to use red, plastic 'biohazard' bags as makeshift toilets.

Passenger Tammy Garcia said: 'It wasn't a vacation anymore it was like survival mode. Eat what you can. 'Snack when you can. It was awful.'
