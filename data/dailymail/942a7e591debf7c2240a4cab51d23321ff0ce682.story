A Washington D.C. police officer is under investigation for allegedly running a prostitution ring out of his apartment.

Officer Linwood Barnhill, 47, has not been arrested but is on paid administrative leave after police found a missing 16-year-old girl in his home Tuesday who told police Barnhill had arranged for her to have sex for money.

The girl told police that Barnhill had 
arranged for her to engage in sex acts with a man for $80 and that he 
told her that her working name would be 'Juicy.'

Cash: From a Photobucket account attributed to Linwood Barnhill, this photo shows a police officer handling wads of cash

Incredibly, a Photobucket account 
belonging to Linwood Barnhill discovered in an online search contains 
numerous pictures of scantily clad young women, a photograph that 
clearly shows a large amount of marijuana, a police officer in uniform 
handling piles of cash and several blank spaces that Photobucket has 
removed as inappropriate content.

Barnhill brazenly used his full name for the account, which has photographic evidence of potentially illegal behavior.

The girl told police that Barnhill took nude pictures of her and that six other women had also prostituted themselves for Barnhill.

A search warrant affidavit filed in federal court alleges sex trafficking of a minor and production of child pornography.

The Washington Times reports that in the apartment, located at 3066 Stanton Road Southeast near St. Elizabeth's Hospital police also found marijuana along with a large number of condoms and nine pairs of women's high heeled shoes.

Linwood Barnhill is a 24-year veteran of the city's 7th District Police Department.

Girls: Linwood's online photo account has numerous photographs of semi-naked young women

The Washington Post
reports that investigating officers stayed at the Southeastern 
Washington DC apartment Tuesday night and most of Wednesday, and after 
obtaining the search warrant confiscated various items including women's
lingerie, computers and cell phones.

Court
documents state that the girl told officers she had been to the 
apartment at least twice. Barnhill took nude pictures of her in sparkly 
high heels and showed them to a potential customer, who was scheduled to
meet with the girl and pay $80 for sex.

Barnhill would keep $20, she said, and also pay for her to have her hair done and new clothes and shoes.

It's not clear whether the girl had actually met with the customer.

Marc Washington: The 32-year-old officer from the 7th District Police Department has been arrested and charged with child pornography

The investigation comes just days after another 7th Division officer, Marc Washington, 32, was arrested and charged with child pornograpy for allegedly taking nude pictures of a 15-year-old girl after she had returned home after being reported missing.

Prosecutors say he told the girl he had to take photos of her injuries, even though she protested she didn't have any. He made her take off her bra and boxer shorts and photographed her.

At a hearing Thursday, it was revealed Washington had hundreds of similar pictures on a digital camera, some of domestic violence victims.

Authorities say the two cases are unrelated.

D.C. Police Chief Cathy L Lanier said in a statement that the department 'is very concerned about the recent allegations of egregious conduct.'
