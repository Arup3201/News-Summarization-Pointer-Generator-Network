United Nations weapons inspectors are
investigating reports that three further chemical weapons attacks were 
carried out in Syria after the 21 August Damascus incident, which 
sparked threats of international military strikes.

A UN statement said that a total of 
seven alleged incidents of chemical weapons use were under 
investigation, and that an inspection team currently in the country was 
meant to wrap up its investigation on Monday.

Attacks are alleged to have included chemical agents in
Khan al-Assal on March 19, Sheikh Maqsoud on April 13, Saraqeb on April
29, Ghouta on August 21, Bahhariyeh on August 22, Jobar on August 24, 
and Ashrafiah Sahnaya on August 25.

More chemical attacks: A convoy of vehicles carrying UN inspectors crosses into Lebanon from Syria. They are investigating allegations that there were further Chemical weapons attacks in the war-torn region in late August

The revelation of further chemical 
attacks comes on the day that the UN was set to discuss a disarmament 
plan for the war-torn country, which could see a full inspection 
programme of Syria's chemical arsenal begin by Tuesday.

After the US and Russia agreed to the
text of a draft agreement for the disarmament of the country, the 
executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons (OPCW) are to discuss an inspection programme tonight.

Chemical weapons watchdog will discuss Friday a disarmament plan for Syria that calls for inspections of the civil war-torn country's chemical arsenal to begin by Tuesday.

The OPCW has authorised inspectors to look at 'any other site identified by a State Party as having been involved in the Syrian chemical weapons programme, unless deemed unwarranted by the Director-General'.

That goes beyond usual practice, as the organisation has only previously inspected sites that have been declared by UN member states.

It further lays out the target of destroying all of Syria's chemical weapons and equipment by 'the first half of 2014'.

The disarmament plan represents a significant breakthrough and rare unity between Russia, which has supported Syrian President Bashar Assad's government, and the US.

According to the plan, Damascus must provide more detailed information on its arsenal within a week of the decision being approved.

Syria must provide: the name and quantity of all chemicals in its weapons stockpile; the type of and quantity of munitions that can be used to fire chemical weapons; the location of the weapons, storage facilities and production facilities; and the destruction of all chemical weapons production and mixing or filling equipment.

The decision calls on Syria to 'co-operate fully with all aspects of the implementation of this decision, including providing the OPCW personnel with the immediate and unfettered right to inspect any and all sites in the Syrian Arab Republic.'

The recent flurry of diplomatic activity was triggered by the August 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb, and President Barack Obama's subsequent threat to use military force.

When US Secretary of State John Kerry said Syria could avert US military action by turning over 'every single bit of his chemical weapons' to international control within a week, Russia quickly agreed.

Mr Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signed an agreement in Geneva on September 13 to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control for later destruction, and the Syrian government accepted and quickly signed up to Chemical Weapons Convention.

Syrian activists say a car bomb near a mosque in a town north of Damascus has killed at least 30 people.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group that monitors the crisis, says the explosion struck as worshippers at the al-Sahel mosque in Rankous were leaving after Friday prayers.

Observatory’s director Rami Abdul-Rahman says dozens of people were also wounded in the bombing.
