Soprano Sarah Brightman, pictured, will blast off for space on September 1 aboard the Soyuz-FG rocket to the International Space Station 

Just before 11am on September 1, a mighty Soyuz‑FG rocket will blast off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome deep in the desert steppes of Kazakhstan.

On board will be a space capsule containing three highly-trained cosmonauts bound for the International Space Station (ISS). The crew will be commanded by Colonel Sergei Volkov, a 42-year-old Russian who will be leading his third mission into space.

Assisting him will be 35-year-old Danish Flight Engineer Andreas Mogensen, the holder of a doctorate in engineering from the University of Texas. The third crew member will be a 55-year-old English soprano called Sarah Brightman.

Hang on a minute. Sarah Brightman? The big‑haired Phantom Of The Opera star who was once married to Andrew Lloyd Webber?

Yes, that very same Sarah Brightman will be boldly going where no multi-millionaire singer has been before.

Brightman, who ironically once fronted Hot Gossip for their 1978 smash hit I Lost My Heart To A Starship Trooper, is becoming a cosmonaut.

It seems like a joke. But the star, who has sold more than 30 million albums, is deadly serious. Recently, she was shivering in sub-zero temperatures in a forest outside Moscow during survival training with her fellow cosmonauts.

This week, Brightman announced that she’ll hold a press conference on March 10 to discuss the mission.

It turns out the singer has always hankered after being the Brightman on the moon.

‘I think I was eight at the time. I remember watching the first man on the moon on TV, and something flipped,’ she said in an interview.

‘I’d been quiet and reticent as a child, and suddenly my mind opened and I thought: “I want to do something very, very special. I want to go there, where they are; I want to go up into space.” That moment, things changed for me.’

The singer’s fascination with space travel may seem surprising — in fact, a cynic might suggest that the whole thing is just a publicity stunt.

But if that’s the case, then it’s a stunt that is financially truly astronomical. The most reliable estimate suggests that Brightman’s ten-day sojourn on the ISS will cost her £34 million.

Brightman may be rich — but not that rich, surely? Space tourists tend to be billionaires, not mere multi-millionaires.

Besides the question of who is funding the trip, what sort of training does a middle-aged woman have to do to be taken around the world 16 times a day? After all, in order to fly into space, you need to be a lot fitter than your average Ryanair passenger.

That’s why, back in July 2012, Sarah travelled from her home near Los Angeles to Houston, where Nasa subjected the singer to the most rigorous medical checks to see whether she could make it as a cosmonaut. Turns out she could.

‘The doctor, who has worked with a lot of astronauts, was saying: “I don’t believe this: even on the brain scans you’re coming out perfect,” ’ Brightman said.

The singer’s next port-of-call was the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City, near Moscow, where she was evaluated on a whole range of simulators.

Perhaps the most gruelling was the centrifuge — a giant arm-like structure that whisks its poor occupants around at something approaching 200mph, simulating the massive g‑forces that astronauts are subjected to when they sit on top of a rocket hurtling into space.

Apparently, Brightman remained calm, with her pulse barely increasing. Other tests included being strapped to rotating chairs, and a psychological evaluation.

‘It was full-on,’ she said. ‘It was far more than I could’ve expected.

‘But I’d already sort of been trained for it by all my years of touring, in terms of the uncomfortableness, not knowing what to expect, having to create something out of nothing.’ Brightman may well have been prepared by the man she has most recently been romantically linked to, a flaxen-haired Californian inventor and aeronautics engineer called Dezso Molnar.

According to Molnar’s website, he worked at Truax Engineering, one of the first companies that attempted to commercialise private manned space travel, and is currently developing a flying motorbike.

With or without his help, Brightman passed through Star City with flying colours. Over the next six months, she can expect training to get even tougher. It will include working in space suits underwater, experiencing weightlessness in specially adapted aircraft, working on her physical and mental fitness, learning some Russian and getting to know her way around a mock-up of the ISS.

The regime would be gruelling even for someone half her age.

However, we must return to that thorny question of who is paying for all this. One clue could be found at the press conference in Moscow in October 2012 when Brightman announced her stellar ambitions.

Sitting alongside her was a man called Neil Ford, who is the director of the sector for external relations and public information of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation).

As it happens, Brightman is a UNESCO ‘Artist for Peace’, which means she is an international advocate for its work.

Ford and Brightman gushed about how the trip into space would ‘reach out to be a force for good’, promote ‘sustainability’ and encourage more women to enter the fields of science and technology.

Brazenly referencing Dream Chaser, the album she would release in 2013, Brightman gushed: ‘We want to engage a generation of dream chasers from all walks of life to help us create a more sustainable future.’

Such sentiments are very worthy but they’re rather woolly. It is unclear how Brightman’s chasing of her own dream will, in reality, improve the planet and the advancement of women.

However, according to a spokesman, UNESCO is not forking out a bean for Brightman’s mission. Nevertheless, its backing naturally makes the singer’s reach for the stars look more humanitarian than purely egotistical.

If UNESCO is providing credibility, then another body is backing the aspirant astronaut in rather more practical ways. In Beijing in July 2013, Brightman signed a deal with the Reignwood Group. Reignwood is a vast Chinese collective firm that — among other activities — develops property, distributes the soft drink Red Bull, owns resorts, runs health centres, has its own aviation firm and has even recently bought Wentworth Golf Club for £135 million.

Also in its portfolio in the UK is 10 Trinity Square in the City of London — now a luxury hotel, club and apartment block.

At the ceremony, Brightman agreed — for an undisclosed fee — to be the ‘image ambassador’ for Trinity Square, and would ‘attend cultural exchanges organised by Reignwood’ every year for the next four years.

She also agreed to perform a concert during her time in the space station that would be streamed live back to Earth ‘during an event organised by Reignwood’.

It is undoubtedly a great coup for the Group. Brightman is a huge star in Asia, and her perceived sophistication is a big draw for the type of clientele that Reignwood wants to woo.

A concert from space given by Brightman will be a fantastic publicity stunt for Reignwood, and would help to cement its global brand.

The Group is worth many billions, so it is conceivable that Reignwood can bankroll most, if not all, of Brightman’s space trip.

Sarah might have secured what may be the ultimate freebie. She may once have lost her heart to a starship trooper, but in order to get her to the heavens, it’s now been won by an Asian conglomerate.

Ultimately, to get into space, it’s not dreams that Brightman has had to chase, but the reality of cold, hard Chinese cash.
