A North Texas police department has fired a jailer and released unsettling video of an man arrested for public intoxication being slammed face-first to the floor during booking.

Denton Police Officer Ryan Grelle said that Wednesday's release of the 20-minute video is a way to apologize to the public and to transparently show what happened.

Jailer Darius Porter was fired last Friday when police concluded he used excessive force during the July 19 booking of Jason Bishop. Bishop says he suffered a broken nose, two black eyes and a cut on the head.

Police say Porter misapplied a technique called a leg sweep that tripped Bishop, whose head struck the concrete floor.

Bishop, 38, who was treated at a hospital, told the Denton Record-Chronicle on Wednesday that his head still hurts but he's otherwise healing.

In the video at the Denton Police Department jail, Bishop is initially seen not following any of the directions given to him by police following his arrest near to the University of North Texas.

He is then lifted off the bench he is sitting on, slammed down onto a desk, hitting his head and then taken into a holding cell.

It is inside the cell that Porter applies a leg sweep that causes Bishop to crash face first down onto the floor.

In the video, which Denton Police released to refute any rumors or accusations that Bishop was beaten, he is seen to lie down for two minutes.

When rolls over, a pool of blood can be seen.

Eventually, Bishop is taken to Denton Regional Medical Center where he was treated for a facial contusion, cut lip, wrist injury and broken nose.

The resulting investigation by police discovered that Porter did not apply a leg sweep properly and because of this, he was fired.

'We are absolutely sorry that it happened to him,' said Grelle to NBC DFW. 'That is not a normal takedown that we usually do.'

He admitted it was up to Bishop to decide if he wanted to pursue any charges against Porter.

However, Grelle added that police have had more than 20 run-ins with Bishop and that he is notorious inside the department.

'There's a lot of rumors going around that he was beaten in the jail, he was handcuffed in the jail, that it wasn't a leg sweep that took him down and caused the facial injuries. We wanted to be transparent and let people see that this is what happened,' said Grelle.
