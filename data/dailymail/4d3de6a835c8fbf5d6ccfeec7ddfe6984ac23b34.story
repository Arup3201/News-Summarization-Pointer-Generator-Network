Tea Party favorite Michele Bachmann has a new political option after her early exit from the GOP presidential race - she can run for office in Switzerland.

The Republican U.S. Representative, whose husband Dr Marcus Bachmann is Swiss, recently activated her right to become a dual U.S.-Swiss citizen along with three of their five children.

'Congresswoman Bachmann's husband is of Swiss descent so she has been eligible for dual-citizenship since they got married in 1978,' said Bachmann's press secretary Becky Rogness.

'However, recently some of their children wanted to exercise their eligibility for dual-citizenship so they went through the process as a family.'

A spokesman at the Swiss embassy said Bachmann had activated that citizenship in March.

In an interview with Swiss television, Bachmann - who pulled out of the race in January for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination - laughed when asked if she would run for office in Switzerland.

'There's a lot of competition ... and it would be very stiff because they are very good,' she said.

Christian counsellor Dr Marcus Bachmann, 55, met his wife at a Minnesota university and they have been involved in politics since working together on Jimmy Carterâ€™s presidential campaign in 1976.

Dr Bachmann is president of Bachmann 
& Associates, a Christian counselling firm based in Lake Elmo and 
Burnsville - two cities around 30 miles apart in Minnesota.

Togetherness: Marcus and Michele Bachmann, right, have raised five children- as well as 23 foster kids - and decided to go for Swiss citizenship as a family

He has been a clinical therapist for more than 20 years after studying at Winona State University in Minnesota, Regent University in Virginia and Union Institute and University in Ohio.

They have raised five children and 23 foster children together.

Mrs Bachmannâ€™s hardline approach throughout her campaign on issues from gay marriage to energy-saving light bulbs saw her win support from the far-right wing but in the end she was seen as little more than a fringe candidate.

She ended her run for the White House in January after a disastrous sixth-place showing in the Iowa caucus.
