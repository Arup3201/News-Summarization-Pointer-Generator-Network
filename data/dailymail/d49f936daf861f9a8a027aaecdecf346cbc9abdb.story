A heroic corner shop manager saved his assistant from a knife-wielding armed robber by pelting the crook with crates of lager.

The masked raider burst into the Nisa store in the wealthy village of Kelvedon Hatch, Essex, brandishing a sharp chef’s knife and ordered Claire Pizzey to open the till.

But as the petrified shop worker, 38, went to hand over the cash, her brave boss Aman Singh Mann came charging out of the shop's storeroom.

Quick thinking: The first crate of Carlsberg lager flies 
through the air at the armed robber who tried to hold up the Nisa store 
in the wealthy village of Kelvedon Hatch, Essex

Brave: Heroic shop manager Aman Singh Mann 
prepares to hurl a second box at the robber, who had burst into the shop
carrying a sharp chef's knife and ordered assistant Claire Pizzey to hand over the day's takings

The fearless 29-year-old picked up a 12-pack of Carling from a nearby shelf and dashed it overhead at the unsuspecting bandit, who tried vainly to bat the box to one side.

Mr Mann kept up his counterattack, grabbing three more of the heavy boxes and hurling them, with one smashing the hooded robber on his leg.

Another case crashed into shelving, causing a stack of baskets to tumble to the ground. Deterred by the fierce resistance, the would-be robber ran from the shop and fled on foot.

A shocked woman who was shopping for some groceries was caught up in the clash last Sunday evening, but also escaped unharmed thanks to Mr Mann's quick-thinking response.

The defiant shop manager has been hailed a hero for his actions and police have released CCTV footage of the beer battering in a bid to trace the robber.

Mr Mann said: 'I just wanted to make sure that Claire was safe and when I saw she was okay and he did not have hold of her, I started to attack.

'The beer was just there in front of me so I grabbed it and threw it. It was just a natural reaction - I did not have much time to think about what I was doing.'

Counterattack: Mr Singh stormed out to confront the robber after hearing a commotion from the shop's storeroom. He said: 'It was just a natural reaction - I did not have much time to think about what I was doing'

Sustained: Mr Mann sent a total of four crates 
of Carlsberg flying at the would-be robber, until the crook ran from the 
shop and fled on foot with nothing to show for his criminal behaviour

Mr Mann, who has managed the store for the past four years, said the raid had come as a surprise.

'You don’t expect that kind of thing to happen around here,' he said. 'But people should not be able to get away with doing that.'

Ms Pizzey was left shaken by her ordeal, but also escaped without any injuries. 'Aman was very brave and his actions saved me,' she said. 'It could have been a lot worse - he is a hero.'

Police were called to the scene and arrived within six minutes. Officers with sniffer dogs searched the surrounding streets but could not find any trace of the runaway robber.

The shop remained closed for more than two-and-a-half hours whilst detectives took statements and dusted for prints.

Mr Mann's uncle, Des Dhesi, 47, owns the shop. He paid tribute to his nephew's fearless reactions.

'What Aman did was quite brave really,' he said. 'We get some occasional shoplifting but no-one has ever come in with a knife before.

'I just want the robber caught so that he does not do that sort of thing again because we are lucky that nobody was hurt.'

Detectives are hunting for the raider who they have described as white, aged 20 to 30 and about 5ft 9ins tall. He was wearing jeans, a black hooded top and a black leather jacket with a dark scarf covering his face.
