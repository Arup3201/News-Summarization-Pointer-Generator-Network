With his pricked up ears and large 'puppy dog' eyes, two-year-old German Shepherd Harry looks the picture of innocence.

But behind that friendly lolling tongue lurks something of a destructive streak, with the pet causing £5,000-worth of damage since his owners took him home as a 12-week-old puppy.  

Despite hardly ever being left alone by owners Kay and Kyle Gregory at their home in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, Harry turns 'destroyer' whenever he is left 'for an hour or two' - or even when the family are asleep.

Scene of the crime: Harry the German Shepherd has caused £5,000 worth of damage to a couple's home in two years since they got him as a puppy, and often gets to the morning post and magazines before his owners

In the past two years, Harry has managed to ruin 15 pairs of shoes, five handbags, four purses, several baseball caps and hats, eight dog beds, bras, coats and countless books.

The pet has also taken chunks out of numerous rugs and carpets, chewed on sofas, door frames, tables, and bannisters - as well as eating several dog leads.

The long list, revealed by Mr and Mrs Gregory - who both work for holiday firms - also includes a George Foreman grill, a Black & Decker garden strimmer and a Dyson vacuum cleaner.

All three electrical items were 'bitten to pieces' by Harry, who left them broken on the floor when he had finished with them.

The list goes on to include two pairs of Mr Gregory's spectacles, ripping up lino floors and chomping on the floor covering - and also biting through and wrecking several wedding presents from when the couple got married on June 2 last year.

Mrs Gregory, 38, said she and her 31-year-old husband 'dare not think' about how much Harry's antics have cost the family, but estimates it to be around £5,000.

Putting his foot in it: In the past two years Harry has destroyed 15 pairs of shoes, including these boots, which had belonged to Mrs Gregory

Pulled apart: Harry has even pulled apart eight dog beds, which his owners then have to replace 

'We got him at 12 weeks old and babied him far too much,' she said.

'We took him to puppy school for three months but he didn't get anything out of it and he started destroying the house one day when he was left on his own while we were at work.

'Luckily, because of our shifts he's only ever left for a couple of hours at a time, but he's destroyed 15 pairs of shoes in his two years living here.

'He used to be able to unlock the shoe cupboard but my husband has moved the lock higher up so he can no longer reach it."

Efforts: Mrs Gregory says she had tried 'almost everything' to stop Harry's destructive streak, taking him to dog trainer for three months, getting a dog behaviour expert in and leaving him with chewy dog toys and treats

She added: "The most shocking thing he ever ate was our George Forman grill.

'We used it in the morning and left it out planning on cleaning up when we got home.. but when we got back it was in pieces - Harry's teeth can cut through metal!

'He has eaten handbags, purses, had a good chew on my coffee table, eaten half the rug and we've just had to pay for the settees to be re-upholsted as he ate them.

'He ate the lino floor and this is our fourth stair carpet so far.

'In fact, last time he ate the stair carpet it had been down less than a week and we couldn't afford to replace it all so we just got the guy to come round and replace the first few steps, which he ate last week.

'He has eaten a lot of the bannister on the stairs and the door frame in one of the rooms.

To tell the tooth: Harry has also taken chunks out of numerous rugs and carpets, chewed on sofas, door frames, tables, and bannister - as well as eating several dog leads

'A few days after our wedding we arrived home to find he had destroyed some of our presents - we don't know what they were as we hadn't opened them - I cried for hours over that."

'He's eaten two pairs of my husband's glasses and my son Michael's favourite baseball cap....I could honestly go on for a long time.'

Mrs Gregory says she had tried 'almost everything' to stop Harry's destructive streak, taking him to dog trainer for three months, getting a dog behaviour expert in and leaving him with loads of chewy dog toys and treats.

Remorse? Mrs Gregory says Harry enjoys destroying things too much to think ahead

No matter what, however, Harry snubs any attempt to change his 'wayward behaviour'.

'Sometimes the damage he does is actually when we are in the house, just last week he crept into our bedroom at night, stole a teddy bear from a shelf and crept downstairs with it,' said Mrs Gregory.

'In the morning the bear had one eye and was looking worse for wear.

'We always know when he's done something wrong as he looks very guilty and looks away and tries to hide.

'He does seem to have some remorse but enjoys destroying things too much to think ahead."

She added: 'When he was a pup we took him to dog classes, to try and train him to be obedient.. it did nothing for him.

'We once had a dog expert come to the house for a couple of hours to see if she could "fix" Harry.

'She was a believer in the primal way of training a dog, the Alpha theory - she certainly knew her stuff but we didn't feel it was the right thing for Harry.

'We had already very much made him our baby so weren't prepared to start growling at him."

'We also set up cameras around the house to see if we could see what was triggering off his destroying.

'We didn't really get anything from it but did see that he was ignoring his toys, bones and chews, instead preferring to munch on furnishings and personal belongings.

'He has many interactive toys and we swap them around so he doesn't get bored of them.

Best pals: Mr and Mrs Gregory say that regardless of everything Harry has destroyed their pet is 'so, so loved'

True love: Harry is also obsessed with cats and is 'best friends' with the Gregory family cat Jess - snuggling up to her and grooming her

'Regardless of everything he has destroyed, he really is the centre of our world. He is so, so loved.'

Harry is also obsessed with cats and is 'best friends' with the Gregory family cat Jess - snuggling up to her and grooming her.

Mrs Gregory said: 'Harry loves cats. He is obsessed with our female cat and is often found trying to snuggle up to her and she spends half of her life with a wet head as he is always licking and grooming her.'

Insurance companies almost never cover 'pet damage' - limiting polices to cover 'vermin' like damage caused by rats and insects, not household pets.
