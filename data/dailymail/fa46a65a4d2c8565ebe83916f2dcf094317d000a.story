Not one to be outdone by a rival, Samsung has unveiled a new curved handset just days after LG declared it was working on flexible displays for smartphones.

Called the Galaxy Round, the Korean firm's new handset has similar specifications to its Note 3 device, but additionally has a 5.7-inch concave screen fixed to curved casing.

It's designed to fit in the palm of a hand more comfortably, but as Android expert Kellex from Droid Life exclaims: 'This is a Galaxy Note 3 with a curved display and a couple of extra gimmicky 
features. We still aren’t seeing a point.'

Apple could also copy rivals Samsung and LG by launching the iPhone 6 with a flexible display, similar to the Galaxy Round, pictured

Display: 5.7-inch curved AMOLED screen

Thickness: 7.9mm thick

Weight: 154g

Battery: 2800mAh

Camera: 13MP

Operating system: Android 4.3

The phone is only currently available in Korea through mobile operator SK Telecom, and costs 109 million won (£632).

Samsung has not announced if or when then the handset will be made available in other countries.

Samsung's Galaxy Round is not technically flexible because it can't bend or change shape, but it is said to be the world's first smartphone to have a curved design.  

The size of the screen makes the Galaxy Round the same size as Samsung's Galaxy Note 3.

It is 7.9mm thick and weighs 154g. Samsung has said that its overall design and curve offers: 'a comfortable hand grip feeling to users, and exclusive experiences of [a] curved display.

Samsung announced in September it was working on phones with a curved display.

Earlier this week, LG Display said it had developed flexible display technology, and its research arm LG Chem confirmed it is almost ready to unveil its bendy batteries.

LG's 6-inch display will be made of bendy plastic substrates, rather than glass, and the panel can be attached to any curved device.

The design is 0.44mm-thick and has a protective film attached to the back, making it 'bendable and unbreakable.'

It has a radius of 7cm, weighs 7.2g and is vertically concave from top to bottom, whereas Samsung's display is horizontally concave. 

The curved Galaxy Gear smartwatch is set to follow Samsung's foray into curved TVs, and likely use the technology found on Samsung's curved phone, the Galaxy Round, pictured, launched in October

Other features of the Galaxy Round that take advantage of the curved display include what's dubbed Roll Effect.

This lets users roll the phone towards them to see the date, time, missed calls and battery life without pressing the power button or activating the home screen.

The Galaxy Round additionally has a 2800mAh battery and a 13MP camera, as seen on the Galaxy S4 and Note 3. It runs Android 4.3 and has 3GB of RAM with a 2.3GHz quad-core processor. 

Both Samsung and LG have already used curved displays on top-of-the-range OLED TVs. On TVs, the curved screen is designed to improve the viewing angle and make shows and films feel more 'immersive.'
