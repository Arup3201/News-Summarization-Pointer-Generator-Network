There you have it. After an hour delay the scrum of journalists and cameraman had a quick chat with the Norwegian, who seemed to be incredibly relaxed having just joined the 10 time European champions! Lets hope he lives up to the hype.

Here is Odegaard posing at his press conference holding up the prestigious Real Madrid shirt that he hopes to wear for years to come at the Bernabeu

The teenager is saying all the right things: 'Its difficult to single one (Madrid player to look up to) but Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world right now.'

The 16-year-old, despite a language barrier, is managing to express his joy at signing for Los Blancos: 'If Ancelotti wants to use me for the 1st team I’ll be really happy and if he doesn’t I’ll play for Castilla and I’ll be happy,' said Odegaard.

Sportsmail's Pete Jenson with some great insight: 'Butragueño confirms player's dad will work at the club as a coach in the lower levels.'

Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: 'Butragueños confirms Odergaard will train with first team and play for B-team in what is left of this season. Good decision by Gazzetta journalist to ask Emilio because Odergaard not giving anything away.'

'It’s a dream come true, it’s unbelievable and it’s incredible I’m ready for the best club in the world - it’s an honour,' claims the youngster.

Finally underway with Emilio Butragueño welcoming a very happy Odergaard to the club.

Nice and brief from Butragueño. Now to the questions for the player who speaks a little English and no Spanish...

Spending £2.3million on a teenage footballer could be seen as quite a risk. It's not always turned out so well for teenage prodigies.

Pete Jenson: 'Martin Odegaard has just left the clinic inside Valdebebas where his medical has been carried out and is on route to the press room.'

Pete Jenson: 'Around 20 Norwegian journalists sent to Madrid today for Odegaard's presentation.

'Still no sign of the sixteen year-old who will become Real Madrid's youngest ever debutant if he beat Jose Rodriguez' record of 17 years and 354 days. Odegaard only turned 16 last month.'

'Well for that money, all you can be sure of is he must be bloody good!

It’s a gamble but Real Madrid are no fools. They will see the wages as a big part of the overall cost of buying somebody so young.

Every now and then a player from around the world comes to the fore and their age doesn’t seem to matter. We saw it with Wayne Rooney breaking through and I’m sure somebody would be offering similar money if we put the clock back.

But it’s a shame to see a kid almost professionally marketed around Europe but then you can’t deny a talent like.'
