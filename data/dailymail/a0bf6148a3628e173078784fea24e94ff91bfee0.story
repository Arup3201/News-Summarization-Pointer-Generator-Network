Residents of Maryville, Missouri say they’re now besieged by threats and in-fighting thanks to national media attention on the Daisy Coleman rape case.

Townspeople fear they’re being cast as villains as the case of the new girl in town who accused two popular teens of rape—only to have the charges suddenly dropped—is being reopened.

As the residents are forced to choose sides, news viewers across the country eager to create their own justice have even begun to threaten people related to the case using phone calls and the internet.

Victim: Daisy Coleman accused Maryville, Missouri teens Matthew Barnett, 19, and Jordan Zech of raping her when she was 14 in January 2012, but the charges against them were dropped by prosecutors, some say suspiciously

Matthew Barnett, now 19, and Jordan Zech, were accused by then 14-year-old Daisy Coleman of rape after she and a friend went drinking with the boys in January 2012.

In the months after the case was dropped because of an apparent lack of evidence, Daisy’s mother Melinda Coleman has been on a quest to get justice for her daughter.

She and her family were new in town, and Barnett’s family had local political connections that some believed helped him and his buddy get off scot-free despite Daisy’s allegations she was given a ‘clear liquid’ that left her incapacitated before she was raped.

Reopened: Charges against Matthew Barnett, left, and Jordan Zech will be revisited, but news of the circumstances under which they were dropped in March 2012 has the town of Maryville, Missouri taking sides and has the public eager for justice in the case of Daisy Coleman's rape accusations

¿Your son is going to get a bullet through his head': The A&G restaurant in town has become the focus of threats from hacktivist group Anonymous, though the owners aren't associated with the accused rapists

And it all came to a head after the Kansas City Star published the Coleman’s story last weekend and Daisy’s story appeared on just about every internet news outlet.

Many residents say it put them in an unfair light.

‘The worst thing to my wife and me is that we have this wonderful little town here and you (the media) have made us look like a bunch of scum,’ 83-year-old Mahlon Fairchild told this Kansas City Star. ‘It’s done a disservice to Maryville, a disservice to our legal system. We’re hurting. We’re hurting. It’s explosive.’

'The media have made us look like a bunch of scum': National media scrutiny has many residents, even those who haven't chosen a side in the case, seething. It¿s done a disservice to Maryville,' said Mahlon Fairchild, 83

Opening up: Paige Parkhurst Borland, seen here with her mother, was with Daisy on the night of the alleged rape. She said that the ordeal was 'very scary'

The case has lit a fire under so called online ‘hacktivist’ group Anonymous, who’ve made threats to physically harm some residents and to destroy their property and livelihood.

The owners of the A&G Greek restaurant in town say they get threatening phone calls every day, and though their son was attended the party where Daisy claims to have been assaulted, he was not implicated in the crime.

‘We got a phone call last night: “Your son is going to get a bullet through his head,”’ one of the owners said Saturday.

Scrutiny: Daisy, at right with her mom Melinda, has graced covers and homepages of major media since news of her saga went national last weekend. The town of Maryville has also become the focus of intense scrutiny, much to its chagrin

Dig deep: Shirley Barnett, left, is the mother 
of Matthew Barnett, 19, one of the high school footballers accused of 
raping Daisy Coleman. She called on everybody to 'dig deeper to find the
truth' around the case and said her son is the real victim in the case threats on her son's safety pour into the tiny town

'We¿re hurting. It¿s explosive': The home Daisy shared with her family was mysteriously burned after they left town. A threat to torch the Maryville high school has since come from a California Twitter user

Their business’s Yelp review page has been hit by Anonymous, too.

‘SO GENEROUS!’ read such post before administrators removed it. ‘Even once you’re stuffed, they keep bringing you food — almost like it’s against your will! When I told them to stop, they smiled and reassured me that I was asking for it.’

In a statement, Anonymous expressed their outright support of Daisy.

'We demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of (the victim’s) case. If Maryville won’t defend these young girls, if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs, if the justice system has abandoned them, then we will have to stand for them. Mayor Jim Fall, your hands are dirty. Maryville, expect us.'

Rumors: All parties involved with the alleged sexual assault attended Maryville High School. Rumors now abound about bomb threats being called into the school and its football field

Second chances: Though she and her family have fled Marylville, wedged in the center of the ongoing saga is Daisy Coleman. Her case, according to county prosecutors, will now be revisited

Nodaway County prosecuting attorney Robert L. Rice, who says neither politics nor connections played a role in his decision not to pursue the charges, has asked for a special prosecutor to reopen the felony case. Meanwhile, threats and division within the towns own ranks continue.

Resident Tess Fornander, 46, fears what her 11-year-old daughter could be exposed to in the town.

‘I didn’t want her to even possibly hear anything about the girl being wrong,’ she told the Star. ‘Her house was burned down. She had to leave town. It’s just crazy.’

Indeed, the home where Daisy lived with her family was mysteriously burned after the family fled town.

Perhaps to make a statement about the fire, a Twitter user in California posted declared he would burn down the high school.

Murmuring about bomb threats have also fluttered through town, though they are unfounded.

Barnett’s mother Shirley Barnett, who has staunchly defended her son, has called on the public leave the townspeople alone.

'There are universities in the state with children from Maryville and they are having to be walked to class because of threats made over the internet, threats that are being made to them. It’s getting worse and worse,’ Barnett told MailOnline last week.

Former school superintendent Roland Tullberg said opinions of his town are worsening, too.

‘It makes Maryville, to people at a distance across the land, look like a community that doesn’t care about the individual. I want you to know that this community is a very fine community,’ he told the Star. ‘It makes people think we don’t care. We do care.’
