'For the past few centuries, we [in the West] have defined beauty as tall, slender figures, femininity and white skin,' thundered model Cameron Russell in a recent talk for the TEDx series of lectures.

'This is a legacy that was built for me, and that I have been cashing in on.'

Now, just weeks after the talk, which has already received 2.3 million Youtube views, the Victoria's Secret Angel, 26, has returned to the attack in a new interview with the Telegraph.

Outspoken: The model during her TEDx talk in which she described herself as a 'pretty, skinny, white woman'

Career: Despite appearing on the Victoria's Secret catwalk (left), she says modelling is 'not a career path'

In it, she urges girls not to become models, describing it as 'not a career path' and criticises the effect that the relentless bombardment of images featuring young, skinny, white girls has on other women's self-esteem.

She's also at pains to point out that even when you're as genetically blessed as she is, you don't always feel good about yourself.

'I have received all these benefits from a deck that is stacked in my favour, and it doesn't always make me happy,' she explains.

'If anyone were to think that looking like a model is the key to happiness, they just need to meet a group of models.

'Because they have the thinnest thighs, and the shiniest hair, and the coolest clothes, and are probably the most insecure group of women on the planet.'

Undue attention: Cameron says her views get more attention than they deserve because of her career

Russell, who has modelled for more than a decade and has worked for Calvin Klein, Prada and Armani as well as Victoria's Secret, has made more than $3million from her work according to Forbes magazine.

She also admits to having gained countless advantages from her looks, despite describing herself as the beneficiary of a 'legacy of gender and racial oppression' during her TEDx talk.

'It's hard for me to see it these days,' she explains. 'You don't realise you are being treated differently, and you think maybe someone is being nice and altruistic, but it happens over and over again, and then you are with someone else and you realise it doesn't happen for them.

'I have no idea what advantages I truly get, but I know people talk to me and give me time of day because they like how I look.'

She worries too about how her TEDx talk was received, worrying that it might perpetuate the white, skinny beauty ideal she hopes to tackle.

'I gave the talk because I wanted to tell an honest personal narrative of what privilege means,' she reveals.

'I work hard but my modelling career gives my views undeserved attention.'

But while her views have certainly been attracting attention, as far as the women who feel under constant pressure to match up to unattainable ideals and many others are concerned, undeserved it is not.
