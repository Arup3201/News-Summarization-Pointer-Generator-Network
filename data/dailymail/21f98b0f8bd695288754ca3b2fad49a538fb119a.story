This is the moment Pharrell Williams and his backing dancers made a 'hands up' gesture in the middle of their Grammy performance. 

The artist took to the stage to perform his track Happy during music's biggest awards ceremony.

While viewers concentrated on his bizarre bellhop costume the music paused for a moment during the song- allowing the performers to raise their hands in unison.

It took place during a successful evening for Williams - who took home Best Solo Performance and Best Video for the track.  

Symbolic: This is the moment Pharrell Williams and his hooded backing dancers made a 'hands up' gesture in the middle of their Grammy performance.

Missable: While viewers concentrated on his bizarre bellhop costume the music paused for a moment during the song- allowing the performers to raise their hands in unison

The gesture is the same used that has recently been used demonstrates protesting the death of unarmed black men at the hands of police. 

The use of hoods was used after the death of Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012.   

However the 'hands up'' refers to Michael Brown, who was gunned down by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, last year. 

Some accounts of the deadly incident claimed the unarmed black teenager had his hands up when the cop shot him. 

A movement which followed adopted the slogan 'Black Lives Matter' and has been used by various celebrities during high profile events and awards ceremonies. 

Prince was one of the stars who used the phrase during the ceremony.  

Before presenting the award for best album, he said: 'Albums... remember those? Albums still matter. Like books and black lives, albums still matter.' 

Successful evening: Williams won Best Solo Performance and Best Music Video for Happy during the night
