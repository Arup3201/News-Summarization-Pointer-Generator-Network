A holidaymaker has told how he cheated death when he was gored by a rampaging bull.

Brian Gage, 57, was tossed and dragged 200 yards by the 1,300lb beast during an annual 'running of the bull' festival in Portugal.

He’d climbed a tree to escape the enraged animal when it speared his leg with its horn and pulled him down.

Lucky to be alive: Mr Gage recovering at home. He suffered extensive wounds including a dislocated shoulder and five broken ribs. He also needed 300 stitches

Mr Gage, of Chingford, Essex, and his friend Stuart Field, 42, were at the bull event in the town of Moita do Ribatejo when he was attacked.

Local people then fought to save Mr Gage by pulling on the bull’s tail.

He was eventually freed and taken to Sao Jose Hospital in Lisbon, where he underwent initial 10-hour surgery for a raft of horrific injuries, before the family endured an anxious three-day wait as Mr Gage was treated in intensive care, with his wife Jill by his side.

Ten weeks after the ordeal he is home, but still confined to his bed.

He was on a three-week holiday with family and friends when the attack happened.

Mr Gage had just finished a family meal in the town of Moita when he decided to step outside with three of his friends, beyond the restaurant gate.

During the annual bull event, gates and bars are installed in front of bars, clubs and restaurants to protect the public.

Two of Mr Gage’s friends crossed the street and climbed a tree to watch the event and Mr Gage was standing near a closed gate and suddenly realised he couldn’t get back into the restaurant.

He said: 'I walked towards a tree and then the bull appeared directly opposite me. As I climbed the tree a bit, the bull had gone around the tree and stuck his horn through my leg and dragged me down off the tree, at which point, I thought that was it.

'The bull pushed me along the ground and threw me up in the air. It pushed me against a wall and continued to gore me (in the stomach) from left to right and went through my scrotum.

'It gave me five broken ribs, took my arm out of its socket, and resulted in me needing over 300 stitches where it slashed me to pieces.'

Happier times: Mr Gage (centre in the beige shirt) before the attack. Ten weeks on and Mr Gage is still bed-bound. He cannot put any pressure on his right leg as he may tear the skin graft and he is only just able to lift his left arm

Local people taking part in the event 
tried to get the bull away from Mr Gage by tugging its tail and banging 
objects on the ground.

However, Mr Gage was thrown around and dragged 200 yards, saying he didn’t feel a thing as he was in shock.

When the bull released Mr Gage, local people moved in and placed him on a stretcher and he was rushed to a first aid centre.

The victim (right) before the accident. He has praised the medical staff in Portugal who saved his life

Mr Gage praised the people at the festival and the medical staff at the hospital.

He said: 'Without a doubt, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them.'

But he said getting on a plane and returning to the UK was also terrifying.

He cannot put any pressure on his right leg as he may tear the skin graft and he is only just able to lift his left arm.

Mr Field watched the drama unfold from up a nearby tree.

He said: 'The bull charged at him front on, pinned him up against a wall, flipped him to the ground, rammed into him several times, and then started dragging him.

'The horn got under his skin, split open his right leg, went up the back of his left leg, and across his groin.'

And Mr Gage’s daughter Vicki, 26, was full of praise for the medical staff in Portugal.

She said: 'The injuries my dad suffered were awful, absolutely horrific and it has been a very stressful situation because he could have died.

'The care and treatment he has received from the staff has been fantastic and the intensive treatment unit is one of the best I have ever been to.'

At a similar 'running of the bull event' event in Pamplona, northern Spain, 15 people have been killed at the annual festival since records began in 1911, and 200 to 300 are usually injured each year.
