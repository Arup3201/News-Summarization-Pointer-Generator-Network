Passengers could soon see the end of liquid limits at airports thanks to an innovative new scanner.

The award-winning technology is currently on trial at Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London and 63 airports in Europe and Australia, where it is playing a vital role in allowing passengers to eventually carry standard containers for drinks, cosmetics and toiletries.

With the aim of stopping threats and speeding up queues, the table-top machine uses a laser to analyse the liquid contents of bottles – without opening them – for bomb ingredients at airport security checkpoints.

Limits: Plane passengers are currently restricted to 100ml limits on liquids in hand luggage

Award-winning technology: The scanner uses a laser to analyse the liquid contents of containers

Cobalt Light System' scanners are currently on trial at 65 airports, including Heathrow and Gatwick in London

The machine has been developed by Oxfordshire-based company Cobalt Light Systems, which is in discussions with the US government about the technology, said CEO Paul Loeffen.

Air travellers are currently banned from carrying liquids over 100ml in their hand baggage, and the smaller containers must be placed in clear plastic bags.

It leads to extra delays for those who fail to prepare ahead of time and more waste as many travellers are forced to throw out full containers that are too large. 

The rule was implemented in 2006 after authorities foiled a terror plot to use liquid explosives to blow up several aircraft travelling from Heathrow to the US and Canada.

It is the European Commission’s goal to lift the ban and screen all liquids, lotions, powders and gels by January 2016 using technology such as Cobalt’s Insight100.

The company’s liquid explosive detection system is able to scan containers up to three litres in size, and its new Insight100M version allows airport screeners to inspect metallic containers.

Cobalt says the chemical analysis is rapid and accurate, and its reliability reduces delays and costs associated with missed flights, confiscations and extra security personnel.

He told MailOnline Travel: ‘It’s part of the solution towards the legislation that is aiming to lift the restrictions on carrying liquids into cabin baggage over the next few years. 

Future uses? Cobalt says the scanner could one day be used for non-invasive cancer screening

The Insight100 uses a laser to determine the chemical composition of liquids in containers up to three litres in size without opening them.

It uses a technique called Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical make-up of a liquid by analysing scattered light and recognising patterns made by different materials.

The scanner works by firing a laser into the liquid at different angles. A small proportion of light penetrates the surface of the liquid and bounces back to give the scanner data.

It then subtracts data about the container from the overall reading to leave it with a faint signal from the liquid. It cross-checks the remaining information with a library of dangerous liquids. And all this takes just five seconds.

The machine is able to separate harmless ingredients from those like hydrogen peroxide that can be used to make bombs.

‘It’s only part of the solution but it enables ultimately passengers to carry liquids in the way they used to do prior to 2006.’

The false alarm rate at the 65 airports is less than one per cent and the average scan time is three seconds or less.

Mr Loeffen said the false alarm rate is key because erroneous scans can lead to delays. 

The £40,000 device has earned Cobalt widespread praise and attention, and led to growth within the firm.

Earlier this year, Cobalt received the MacRobert Award from the Royal Academy of Engineering, the UK’s premier engineering prize.

And there are plans to use the technology for other purposes.

In addition to identifying liquid explosives, Cobalt said the machine could one day be used for non-invasive cancer screening or detecting narcotics, precursors and toxic chemicals, and counterfeit products.
