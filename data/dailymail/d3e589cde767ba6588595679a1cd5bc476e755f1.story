Football agents are threatening to injunct the FA from introducing new FIFA regulations in April, following world football’s ruling body washing their hands of controlling the game’s middlemen.

The Association of Football Agents met on Friday and will take legal action against the fresh set of rules governing their conduct. That is if their complaint to the European Commission and a couple of planned meetings in Germany fail to resolve the turmoil.

Mel Stein, chairman of the AFA that represents almost all the UK’s agents, said: ‘We will have no option. It’s a total disgrace that FIFA are passing the buck to national associations having recommended an unworkable code. And it will be the Wild West out there, with anyone able to act as agents.’

The FIFA recommendations include national associations registering only intermediaries of ‘impeccable character’, all deals annually published online, agents’ fees limited to three per cent and no monies earned by them for negotiating deals for players under 18.

The FA, Premier League and Football League have been discussing how best to cope with FIFA opting out. All have serious concerns about how the system will work in Britain and abroad, especially in under-developed football territories.

A FIFA spokesperson said: ‘The new approach is about having better control of the activity and follows a lengthy, in-depth reform process with numerous options considered.’

There is no chance whatsoever of Gordon Taylor, 70-year-old chief executive of the PFA, being asked to resign by his management committee — be it for running up huge bookmaking debts or making deplorable comparisons this week between the Hillsborough disaster and the Ched Evans case. Taylor surrounds himself with ultra-loyal staff at his private fiefdom.

Graham Bean, the former FA compliance officer who was brought in for a period by Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino to stabilise the troubled club, is himself facing a £100,000 pension fraud charge in Manchester on January 19. 

Bean will vigorously defend the charge, brought by HMRC. He will claim to have been victim of a pension scam by a professional advisor who has fled the country after being struck off by the Financial Services Authority.

ITV Sport, who have rights to the Africa Cup of Nations starting on January 17, will be producing all their programming from London — sending no one abroad.

Yet the BBC are spending licence-fee money funding an army of over 20 personnel. They will be going to Africa to service the overblown website, Radio 5 Live and the World Service. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea’s London embassy report numerous visa applications from the BBC.

There is a worry at the top of BBC Sport that the Corporation will lose one of their flagship rights properties this year. The two most vulnerable are Match of the Day highlights and the Open championship. 

The golf contract is most in danger of being lost to Sky after 2016 — which Sports Agenda was the first to reveal as a significant threat last July. One thing is for sure. If Sky do capture the Open, there will be no more ridiculous schedule clashing with the Lord’s Ashes Test, which happens again this summer.

There has been an understandably negative reaction in Scotland to flu-hit Mo Farah pulling out of Saturday's Great Edinburgh cross-country international. 

It is the third time in less than six months he has let down athletics fans north of the border, following his withdrawals from Glasgow’s Diamond League meeting and the Commonwealth Games. 

Meanwhile, Lord Coe would like to see cross country included in the Winter Olympics to encourage African interest. Joe Williams, from Coe’s first athletics club Sheffield’s Hallamshire Harriers, represented GB in cross country the last time it was included — 1924.

If departing chairman Giles Clarke fails to win enough county support to stay on the England Cricket Board in a new president’s role, Glamorgan chairman Barry O’Brien, a London lawyer, will challenge Notts’ Peter Wright for the vice-chairmanship vacated by Colin Graves succeeding Clarke.
