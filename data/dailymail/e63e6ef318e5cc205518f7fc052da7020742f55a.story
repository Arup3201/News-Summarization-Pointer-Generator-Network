As managers up and down the land were frantically trying to make final adjustments to their squads on deadline day, Wolves boss Kenny Jackett could afford to put his feet up.

Heading into the international break, Jackett’s side sit third in the SkyBet Championship having won four of their first five games back in second tier.

Inheriting a club in total disarray last summer, Jackett has shown himself to be an expert in squad building.

Means business: Kenny Jackett has revamped a Wolves since taking over at Molinuex 

In little over a year in the Black Country, he has transformed a playing squad with no coherence, direction or belief into a well-drilled machine that looks capable of back-to-back promotions.

Jackett has overseen a clearout of massive proportions, with 15 players leaving Wolves since he joined.

In his own methodical and calm way, he has rejuvenated the club, giving it a clear identity and direction in building his side around a first-rate academy that was criminally ignored by predecessors Stale Solbakken, Dean Saunders and, to a lesser extent, Mick McCarthy.

Jackett has fielded the same starting XI in each of Wolves’ five league games so far this season. Of that side, David Edwards is the oldest player at just 28, while three academy products - goalkeeper Carl Ikeme, centre back Danny Batth and full back Matt Doherty - have been key, with a further three home-grown Wanderers on the bench.

Chief executive Jez Moxey and owner Steve Morgan have invested total faith in the former Millwall manager to turn their club around (in fairness, they gave the same backing to Solbakken and Co, just this time the manager knew what he was doing).

All smiles: Wolves sit third in the Championship after winning four of their opening five fixtures 

There are still five more players on the transfer list and training away from the first-team in the shape of defenders Roger Johnson, Kevin Foley and Georg Margreitter, winger Razak Boukari and striker Kevin Doyle, though Jackett has not let that disrupt his building of what is now very much his team.

The signings along the way have been in keeping with his vision of a young, hungry group of players.

This summer, Dutch winger Raymond van la Parra, midfielder George Saville and versatile former Peterborough captain Tommy Rowe have enhanced a squad stregnthened last season with the additions of the likes of Kevin McDonald, Nouha Dicko, Michael Jacobs and James Henry.

What is has left Wolves with - excluding the exiled five - is a squad of 26 which includes no fewer than 13 academy graduates, with a further two in Zeli Ismail and Jake Cassidy impressing out on loan in League One with Notts County. Another out on loan is talented teenage centre back Kortney Hause, signed this summer from Wycombe.

Shrewd move: Wanderers landed Peterborough United skipper Tommy Rowe in the summer

Remarkably, captain Sam Ricketts is the only player in Jackett’s squad over the age of 30, while there are only four over the age of 27.

Jackett has not backed youth for youth’s sake, just as he hasn’t sold for the sake of it either. Bakary Sako, for example, fitted in to the bracket of high-earners signed by Solbakken, yet Jackett recognised the brilliant talent he had on his hands and has moulded Wolves’ attacking structure around the French winger.

Sako is probably the best wide man outside the top flight and has been rewarded for his loyalty - as may Wolves fans be come May.

With no standout side coming down from the Premier League, the promotion race looks set to be wide open and there is no reason why Wolves can’t emulate the recent achievements of Southampton and Norwich in earning back-to-back promotions.

Good week for ... PETERBOROUGH. Having lost top scorer Britt Assombalonga and captain Tommy Rowe over the summer, Posh looked like they could struggle to make the top six in League One heading into the start of the season. But following Saturday’s 3-1 win at Colchester, Darren Ferguson’s side sit top of the third-tier tree. Peterborough had a similarly strong start last season, however, and can’t afford to fall away like they did if they are to win promotion.

Missing? Peterborough lost striker Britt Assombalonga to Nottingham Forest but are still scoring goals

Bad week for ... CARLISLE. Time has run out for Graham Kavanagh following Saturday’s 5-0 defeat by Cambridge. After an up-turn in fortunes following Kavanagh’s appointment in September last year, it has been a miserable 2014 for the Cumbrians. Despite boasting one of the strongest squads in League Two they are yet to win this season and an immediate return to the third tier already looks like wishful thinking.

That's your lot! Graham Kavanagh was sacked as manager of Carlisle United on Monday morning

Talent scout: Cameron Lancaster (Stevenage)

Did he mean it? Probably not, but Lancaster’s debut goal for Stevenage following his release by Tottenham was one to savour. The 21-year-old forward earned three points for Graham Westley’s side with a curling 40-yard effort from the touchline to seal a 3-2 win at AFC Wimbledon. Lancaster’s career has stalled badly since making his Spurs debut in the Premier League in January 2012 but with time on his side and first-team opportunities available in League Two, he can add plenty more to his goal tally.

What a strike! Cameron Lancaster is mobbed by his Stevenage team-mates after scoring against Wimbledon
