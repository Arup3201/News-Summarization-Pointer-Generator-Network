Pioneering pilots who died leading the way into Britain’s Jet Age will be given a permanent memorial.

Plans have been unveiled for a memorial centre to honour the pilots and crews who died at RAF Westonzoyland in Somerset, which was used as a training base for flying early jets like the Meteor.

The base, located between the villages of Westonzoyland and Othery, was in operation from 1926 to 1958 - but only some patches of land covered in concrete and abandoned buildings now remain.

Remembered: The village of Westonzoyland in Somerset has 13 graves of those who died at the airfield

Historian Robbert Turner is hoping to 
build a permanent centre in Westonzoyland, which will also look at the use of the airfield.

He
said: ‘After the First World War and the inception of the RAF, this 
would have been the earliest days of that new organisation, and they 
were scouring the whole part of the southern region of the country 
looking for a suitable site.

‘After
they came to Westonzoyland they didn’t look any further - back in those
days there weren’t many trees to worry about, no electrical overhangs. 
It was a pilot’s dreamland, really.’

The
village of Westonzoyland has 13 graves of those who died at the 
airfield and, according to Mr Turner’s research, another four pilots 
lost their lives at sea during sorties over the Bristol Channel.

It is believed up to 800 pilots lost their lives during the early years of the jet age across the country.

Frank Whittle, of Coventry, West Midlands, worked on combining gas turbines and jet propulsion while at the RAF College Cranwell and filed his first patent in the 1930s.

With the threat of war towards the end of the decade, the Government began to back his idea to give the Allies more strength in the air.

The first aircraft to fly with a Whittle gas turbine was the Gloster E28/39 in 1941. Its technology was shared with the U.S. to help the war effort.

The first ever jet airliner took off in 1952 from London to
Johannesburg, with five stops. The BOAC Comet G-ALY was hailed a success, but had
three fatal accidents in its first few years.

It was later realised that a major design flaw resulted in an area of the aircraft constantly
weakened at high altitude until air burst through a small gap. All of the planes were grounded and redesigned, before they
went back into commercial service in 1958.

But many airlines then opted for the new
American Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8.

‘We’re talking the early 50s,’ Mr Turner said. ‘Although people don’t realise it, these jets - or the early versions of them - were flying in 1951, 1952. They were doing a lot of low-level flying here with sorties out over the Bristol Channel.

'Some of these were not ejector-seat installed, so really there was no chance of escape if something went wrong at low level.

‘A friend of mine, Ian, was as a young boy offered a flight in one of those but he turned it down, as they were known as flying coffins.’

The aim is to collect more stories from people who worked or lived near the base to compile a history of the airfield. This project will also run in tandem with fundraising efforts for the new centre.
