Nine months ago, Anna Trickett was a popular, enthusiastic schoolgirl who enjoyed spending time with her family and friends.

Now her parents say their beautiful ten year old has turned into a violent ‘caged animal’ who lashes out at them, screams and refuses to walk or talk.

The cause of the disturbing transformation is a rare condition which Anna developed after suffering a minor ear infection.

Anna Trickett was a popular, bubbly child until she got a simple ear infection. After the infection, she developed Pervasive Refusal Syndrome - a rare psychological condition. She is pictured before she fell ill

She is the third person in the UK to 
be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder known as pervasive refusal 
syndrome (PRS).

It is a debilitating condition in which sufferers shun 
daylight and become violent towards those around them.

Anna now spends 
most of her time under blankets in her room with the curtains closed, 
lashes out at her parents and often has to be force-fed.

The once lively little girl has not 
voluntarily been outside in the day or seen any friends for nine months.
She even has to be taken to the bathroom in a wheelchair because she 
believes she cannot walk.

Her parents Scott Trickett, 40, and 
Libby Bryant, 49, first took their daughter into hospital with a viral 
ear infection last November.

PRS is a rare but serious psychiatric disorder that was first described in 1991.

It’s characterised by refusal to eat, drink, talk, walk, or self-care, and a firm resistance to treatment.

The
disorder usually begins with a virus that results in the need for 
consulting a doctor or going to the hospital, even though no substantial
cause can be found.

PRS starts slowly, but the child then worsens quickly becoming reluctant to, or not capable of, doing anything for themselves.

They refuse to accept others caring for them, or helping them eat, and are very depressed and distraught.

It is not guaranteed that recovery will take place, and it is a lengthy and complex process, involving specialist medical care.

In the weeks that followed, her personality
transformed drastically and she became withdrawn and aggressive. 

She has been diagnosed with PRS – a 
rare disorder that has affected only a handful of people in Britain 
since it was recognised in 1991 and makes children ‘abandon involvement’
in their lives.

The disorder is triggered by a virus 
or infection.

Anna developed an intolerance to sunlight and needs 
black-out blinds, thick curtains and a duvet to block any trace of light
in her bedroom.

When family members and doctors have 
visited at home, Anna’s outbursts have been so violent that frightened 
neighbours  have called the police.

Miss Bryant, a lifeguard from 
Plymouth, Devon, said: ‘It’s been horrible. Anna went from a lovely, 
polite, well-mannered child to a little girl who seemed possessed.

'It 
was as though someone had taken our little girl away and replaced her 
with a disturbed and completely different person.

‘Police have barged in a couple of 
times thinking we’re abusing Anna because it sounds like she’s being 
violently attacked because of all the banging and intense screaming.

Our
house is now flagged on the police system so if they get called again 
they are aware of her condition.’

She added: ‘We always knew that 
Anna’s out-of-character behaviour was not her fault. When we got her 
diagnosis it all became a lot clearer and made much more sense.

‘She’s got a very serious illness and we love her just the same in spite of everything.’

After Anna's condition worsened in February, she spent six weeks in Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where she was kept in isolation because of her violent outbursts and was force-fed through a tube. She is pictured here before she became ill

February she spent six weeks in hospital where she was fed through a 
tube and kept in isolation because of her violent outbursts.

Anna’s parents, who also have an 
eight-year-old son called Toby, decided to bring her home to provide 
24-hour care. Mr Trickett, 40, a leisure centre supervisor, said: ‘She 
hides under her duvet for protection. It’s as though she’s in her own 
little world.’

The couple say, however, that there 
have been glimpses of the old Anna since she came home.

Anna's parents hope that she is starting to improve as she left the house voluntarily for the first time in months and has started to show interest in drawing and painting again. She is pictured here before contracting the ear infection

Dr Stephen Westgarth, medical 
director of Child Psychiatry UK, said PRS was a complex disorder  that 
was not included in the standard psychiatric classification systems.  He
added: ‘The severity of pervasive refusal disorder varies from child to
child.

‘One child may simply refuse to go to school as a result of the disorder, while others may refuse to clean, eat or even drink.

‘As is seen in this case, obsession 
and anxiety are common effects of the disorder. The child often feels 
they need control, routine and predictability for safety reasons.

‘At its worst the disorder can be life-threatening.’

Anna's parents are now raising money to get her treatment from a London-based specialist. She is pictured as a young bubbly girl before she became seriously ill with the psychiatric disorder

It is not certain whether even treatment in London would be able to help Anna (pictured before ill)
