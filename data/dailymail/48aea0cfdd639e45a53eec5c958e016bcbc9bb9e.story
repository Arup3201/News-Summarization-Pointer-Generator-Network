Former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are worth between $10 and $50 million, according to their financial disclosure forms – but taxpayers will still pony up nearly $1 million this year to fund their post-White House lifestyle.

Like the three other living former presidents, Jimmy Carter and the two George Bushes, Clinton receives a $201,000 annual pension. But that just scratches the surface of the government benefits he shares with his wife Hillary.

The total for 2014 also includes $157,000 for staff salaries and benefits, $414,000 for office space and $9,000 for phone bills.

In all, The Washington Post first reported, taxpayers are providing Clinton with $944,000 in post-presidential pay and benefits.

Overkill? Bill Clinton costs taxpayers nearly $1 million every year, five times what his salary was during his presidency

Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is scrambling to redefine her public image, with husband Bill saying Tuesday that focusing on their joint wealth is 'the wrong debate' to have as the 2016 election season approaches

Public art subsidy? Former president George W. Bush got $1.28 million in government payments and benefits this year while he painted portraits

Nice digs: Taxpayers shelled out $414,000 this year for Bill Clinton's office in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City

That tab was $1.28 million in 2002, the year after he left office, according to a Congressional Research Service report cited by the Post and the Washington Free Beacon.

Hillary Clinton was lambasted in the press for saying on June 9 that she and Bill were 'dead broke' after their White House tenure.

Her rhetorical play at poverty during an ABC News interview included the claim that she and Bill 'struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea’s education, you know – it was not easy.'

The CRS report, issued in April, also noted that government payments and benefits for former President George W. Bush outstripped Clinton's in every full year since Bush left the White House.

Bush the younger is costing taxpayers $1.28 million this year, and averages 4 per cent more annual than Clinton.

The government's General Services Administration inexplicably budgeted $102,000 for Bush's telephone expenses in 2014, and planned to spend $135,000 more on furniture, computers, office supplies and other miscellany.

The former president and first lady both tried to pivot away from the national frenzy over their elite financial status on Tuesday, with Bill Clinton saying that his wife is 'not out of touch' with the middle-class Americans.

During an annual Clinton Global Initiative conference in Denver, he told event moderator David Gregory of NBC’s 'Meet the Press' on stage that discussing their millions is 'the wrong debate' to have in the run-up to the 2016 election season.

Instead, according to Businessweek, he claimed the public should focus on how to counter the 'demise of the American dream.'

He acknowledged that Hillary didn’t 'give the most adept answer' to questions about whether they were as wealthy as Republican politicians who have been tripped up by insinuations of upper-class snobbery.

'You can say, "OK, I gotta clean that up," which she did,' he claimed.

But 'it is factually true that we were several million dollars in debt,' Clinton said, and reporters 'should put this in some sort of context.'

He also claimed that he had 'the lowest net worth of any American president in the twentieth century when I took office, but I still could have been tone deaf. And, you know, now I don’t. And we’ve got a great life and I’m grateful for it.'

'But I still, we go to our local grocery store on the weekend. We talk to people in our town. We know what’s going on. The real issue is, if you’ve been fortunate enough to be successful, are you now out of touch and insensitive to the agonizing struggles other people are facing?'

Pivot: On Tuesday in Denver Bill Clinton tried to reposition his wife Hillary, the former secretary of state, describing her as a warrior for poor and middle-class Americans instead of a wealthy, out-of-touch elitist

At the same Denver event, Hillary Clinton repositioned herself as a warrior for the downtrodden, including poor children.

Upward mobility 'really does take a village,' she said.

Mrs.
 Clinton hasn't yet said whether she will run for president. Her 
missteps in recent weeks, along with lackluster sales of her memoir 
'Hard Choices,' have become the first chink in what was thought to be an
 unassailable political armor.

The Former Presidents Act of 1958 provides one-time residents of the White House with pensions, office expenses, professional staff, coverage for medical care, and lifetime Secret Service protection.

Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz tried to change the arrangement in 2012 with his Presidential Allowance Modernization Act, but it died in committee.

The legislation would have capped the government's total spending on any former president to $400,000. And that amount would have been reduced dollar-for-dollar by any money they earned.

Ka-ching: Bill Clinton and George W. Bush together collect more than $2 million each year in taxpayer money and benefits -- not including the cost of Secret Service protection -- and will continue that pace until they die

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, George W. Bush costs taxpayers more in his post-presidency than any other former president

Under that scenario, Clinton would have received nothing this year and last year. His earnings for individual speeches reportedly can top $500,000.

'Nobody wants our former presidents living the remainder of their lives destitute," Chaffetz said at the time, 'but the fact is none of our former presidents are poor.'

'Reports actually indicate that between book tours and speaking fees, these men are making millions of dollars a year. There's little reason why American taxpayers should be subsidizing these former presidents when they're doing fine on their own.'

Jimmy Carter, who left office in 1981, spends the least among the four living former presidents. His office space costs just $109,000 per year, and the GSA budgeted $466,000 for his total upkeep in 2014.
