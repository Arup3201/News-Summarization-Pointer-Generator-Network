Criminal: Ian Watkins, 35, pictured with former girlfriend Fearne Cotton, faces jail after his guilty pleas

The lead singer of rock band Lostprophets was refused bail today after being accused of plotting to rape a child aged under 13.

Ian Watkins, a former boyfriend of Radio 1 DJ and TV presenter Fearne Cotton, was remanded in custody charged with six child sex offences.

The 35-year-old was charged with conspiring to engage in sex with an underage girl.

He faces three separate charges of possession, creation and distribution of indecent images of children.

The singer, from Pontypridd, Wales, is also charged with possession of 'extreme pornography'.

Cardiff magistrates court heard that 40 images of children and child abuse were being investigated by police.

Two unnamed women, aged 20 and 24, from Doncacster and Bedford, have also been charged with 'similar offences'.

Making an application for all three to be refused bail, prosecutor Mrs Suzanne Thomas said: 'They are the sort of charges which will cause public revulsion. The penalty would be a custodial sentence if they were found guilty.'

Watkins was arrested on Monday as part of an ongoing investigation into child sex offences.

The rock star dated presenter Cotton for less than a year in 2005, although the pair are thought to have remained friends and were pictured together in 2008.

He appeared in court today wearing a black jacket with a high collar and was watched by his mother.

A forlorn-looking Watkins did not speak during the 90-minute hearing.

Lostprophets, whose hits include Last
 Train Home, are one of the most successful bands to have emerged from 
Wales in recent times, selling around 3.5 million albums worldwide.

They were at the forefront of the UK's burgeoning nu-metal scene, appealing to teenage fans.

Their
 second album, 2004's Start Something brought global recognition, with 
the album going gold in America, amassing sales of more than 500,000, 
and the band embarking on a world tour.

Tattooed Watkins formed the band in 1997 with friends from the small former mining town of Pontypridd.

Weapons, Lostprophets's fifth studio album, was released in April and was supported by a UK tour.

But while the band once sold out 
Wembley arena and headlined major festivals, such as Download, their 
success has waned in recent years.related]

A police spokesman said: 'A Pontypridd man 
has been charged with sexual offences against children and is due to 
appear at Cardiff Magistrates' Court today.

Singer: Watkins was one of three people charged by police. Two women, aged 20 and 24, were also charged with 'similar offences'

'The 35-year-old has been charged with
 conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a female under 13 and 
possession/distribution of indecent images of children.

'In order to assist their 
investigation, South Wales Police has named the man as Ian Watkins, a 
member of the rock group Lostprophets."

Senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Peter Doyle said specially-trained staff were available to speak to anyone with concerns or information regarding this investigation.

'I want to encourage anyone who has any concerns or information which they think may be relevant to contact us,' he added.

'Safeguarding children involved in such cases is always a high priority and as such measures have already been taken.'

Speaking after the case John Cameron, head of child protection operations for the NSPCC said: 'We can confirm we are working alongside South Wales Police and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre on this investigation.

'Itâ€™s vital we send a clear message to those who have experienced abuse that they can never be to blame for what has happened to them.

'That they have somewhere to turn and that they will be taken seriously.'
