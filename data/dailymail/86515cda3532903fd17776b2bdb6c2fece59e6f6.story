A new study has revealed the best places in the world to live, with Paraguay residents saying they are the happiest.

For the first time, the entire top ten of Gallup's Positive Experience Index is from Latin America.

The two countries with the worst happiness ratings were both in Africa, with Sudan scoring right below Tunisia, the site of a terrorist attack earlier this week.

The United States tied for 15th with a index score of 79, eight higher than the global mean of 71.

Latin American countries dominated the upper echelons of Gallup's Positive Experience Index. Above, Colombian girls smile outside their home in Buenaventura, despite widespread violence in the city

The United Kingdom tied for 43rd with six other counties, receiving a score of 75. 

The Gallup study polled adults in 143 countries and asked them a series of questions about the previous day including: Did you feel well-rested? Did you feel respected all day? Did you smile or laugh a lot? Did you learn something or do something interesting? and Did you feel enjoyment?

More than 70% of people throughout the world said they experienced  enjoyment, respect, rest, and smiles the day before.

Respondents were also asked about their experience of positive and negative emotions.

Paraguay also claimed the top spot last year, though its score has moved up from 87 to 89.

Colombia, whose contestant also won Miss Universe 2014 earlier this year, was ranked second.

None of the Latin American countries that rank the happiest have Gross Domestic Products in the top 25, according to the World Bank.

The United Kingdom tied for 43rd with a number of other countries. It scored two points higher this year than last. Above, Racegoers at the Cheltenham Festival smile as they cheer on their horses

Top 10 economies ranged in rank from 15th, the US, to 85th, Russia. 

Researchers say the results stem from the continent's culture, which tends to focus on the positive. 

Little has changed at the top of the chart, with only Denmark falling out of the 10 happiest countries.

Countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe see generally lower scores.

Nations formed after the fall of the Soviet Union generally show less positive as well as less negative emotions. 

Gallup did not include data for Syria and several Gulf Cooperation Council countries such as the United Arab Emirates, which was ranked 15th last year with a score of 79.

Syria tallied the lowest-ever positive emotion score last year with 36.

The worldwide positive experience indicator has remained relatively constant, hovering around 70. 

Interviews were conducted through various methods, including face-to-face interviews and by telephone. 

Tunisia, which ranked second from the bottom on the happiness list, was struck by a terrorist attack earlier this week
