A police officer is being treated in hospital after being sprayed in the face with a noxious substance, believed to be ammonia.

The attack happened after the male officer, who was in uniform, stopped a man on a silver moped on York Place in Battersea, south London, at around 3pm this afternoon.

The suspect then sprayed the substance into the officer's face before fleeing the scene.

Attack: A police officer was sprayed in the face with ammonia on York Place in Battersea, south London

The officer, from the Met was taken to a central London hospital for treatment. His current medical condition is unknown, but it is understood that the injuries are unlikely to be life-changing.

Police have been analysing the substance and is understood initial indications are that it was ammonia.

Ammonium hydroxide is commonly used in household cleaning products and garden sprays. While not likely to cause permanent damage, it can cause irritation if exposed to a person's eyes, nose and mouth.

Police are now hunting for the moped rider and have appealed to the public for information.
