The historic vote on whether Scotland should break away from the rest of the UK will be held on September 2014, it was announced today.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond fired the starting gun on what will be a tightly-fought over the merits of independence.

It is thought he will use the 700th anniversary of the Scottish win at the Battle of Bannockburn to bolster patriotic fever.

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond told MSPs in Edinburgh that this historic vote will be held on 18 September 2018

By holding the vote in 2014, Mr Salmond hopes to use the 700th anniversary of the the Battle of Bannockburn to bolster patriotic fever

Mr Salmond, the Scottish National Party leader, declared that would be the 'historic day when the people will decide Scotland's future'.

Signalling that there were 547 days until polling day, he told MSPs: 'I believe it will be the day we take responsibility for our country, when we are able to speak with our own voice, choose our own direction and contribute in our own distinct way.'

Leaving the United Kingdom and becoming a separate country would give Scotland a 'new, more modern relationship with the other nations of the UK" that would be a "true partnership of equals'.

He adding: 'I believe on September 18 the people of Scotland will vote Yes to create a better country than we have now, one we can pass on with pride to the next generation.'

The vote is taking place after the SNP won an unprecedented majority in Holyrood in the 2011 election.

Former chancellor Alistair Darling (second left) said pressure would mount on Mr Salmond to spell out what independence would mean. He is leading the Better Together campaign against independence, with (left to right) Scottish Labour Party Leader Johann Lamont, Scottish Conservative Party Leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie

Mr Salmond said: 'Next year the choice facing the people is one of two futures. A No vote
means a future of governments we didn't vote for, imposing cuts and 
policies we didn't support.

'A Yes vote means a future where we can be 
absolutely certain, 100 per cent certain, that the people of Scotland will get 
the government they vote for.'

Former chancellor Ken Clarke today warned pro-independence campaigners not to bank on a North Sea oil boom.

Speaking in Edinburgh, the Conservative minister told Alex Salmond not to ‘bet the ranch’ on figures ‘pulled from the air’.

His comments followed the release of figures which showed North Sea oil and gas tax revenues will drop from £34 billion to £33 billion between 2012-13 and 2017-18.

The change appears to leave an £8.5 billion gap between the OBR's revised figure and the Scottish Government's least optimistic estimate.

Mr Clarke, the UK Minister without Portfolio, said: ‘I don't find them very convincing. Nobody believes that (oil) is an answer to our economic problems.

‘If we were to have an independent Scotland, it is not the case that it would not somehow have to face up to the consequences of economic crisis.’

He added: ‘The main thing I pick up is concern among my political friends in Europe. The average Spaniard and the average Belgian is far from excited about the prospect of having a referendum of this kind,’ Mr Clarke said.

Mr Salmond announced the date to Holyrood as the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill was published.

He has already put forward legislation to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to take part in the crucial vote.

In January the elections watchdog 
today threw out an attempt by Alex Salmond to skew the question in the 
Scottish independence referendum to coax people into voting Yes.

The Scottish Government wanted to ask voters: 'Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country? Yes/No.'

But
the independent Electoral Commission has demanded 'more neutral 
wording' and insisted voters have a clearer idea about what severing 
ties with the rest of the UK will mean for Scotland.

The question voters will be asked in next year's vote will be: 'Should Scotland be an independent country? Yes/No.'

Former
chancellor Alistair Darling, the chairman of the cross-party Better 
Together group campaigning to keep Scotland in the UK, said there were 
still unanswered questions about independence.

He said: ‘I think most people in Scotland are desperately anxious to know the facts here, to know what the details are.

‘Of course I'm ready and I'm willing to put forward a powerful case for why Scotland is stronger and better as part of the UK.

‘What is singularly lacking on the other side though is anything remotely resembling a compelling case for making a complete break, it really is buying a one-way ticket to a deeply uncertain destination.’

He added: ‘This is the biggest single decision we will make and that is why I strongly believe we need the details from the other side, from the Nationalists. They have failed to provide that so far.

"It's all very well to produce the date after this long and unnecessary delay, but we now need to get the details so we can get stuck into a serious debate."

Earlier Blair Jenkins, the chief executive of the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign, said the announcement of the date was ‘another important landmark day that brings us closer to the referendum’.

He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "For those of us who believe the best future for Scotland is as an independent country it's a very significant day.

"It makes the referendum much more imminent and gives an added reality to it. We move from the stage where a lot of the debate about independence has been at a theoretical level, a process level. I think people are engaging more and more with the issues.’

The Electoral Commission also recommended the main Yes and No campaigns be allowed to spend up to £1.5million each in the run up to the big vote.

Better off in: The Scottish Social Attitudes survey revealed only 23 per cent of people want Scotland to be independent, the lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999

Pro-independence campaigners suffered a major blow in January when a major survey revealed support for Mr Salmond’s dream of going it alone was now at its lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.

Experts claim increased publicity for the SNP’s campaign to leave the UK has meant more people are now fearful of what independence might mean.

Just 23 per cent of people want Scotland to leave the UK, the annual Scottish Social Attitudes survey for 2012 revealed.

It shows a dramatic drop from 2011 when 32 per cent supported independence. Almost 60 per cent of those surveyed now say they are ‘quite’ or ‘very’ worried about independence, up from 46 per cent in 2011.
