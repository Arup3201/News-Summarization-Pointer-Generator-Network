An Austrian businesswoman has embarked on a venture that sounds completely barking - she has opened a hotel that caters specifically for dogs.

When takings at Friederike Zaubek's Alpine retreat fell off after the credit crunch hit, she decided to reinvent the resort as a completely unique getaway.

The Sun Hotel in Carinthia now offers a menu of freshly cooked gourmet treats, doggy sun loungers, fitness rooms and swimming pools for guests to dip their paws into.

'People may cut back on spending for themselves but they always seem to have money to spend on treats for their pets,' said Ms Zaubek.

'We will take humans, but only if they're accompanied by a responsible dog.'

Pampered pets wallowing in the lap of luxury can choose between stretching out in deckchairs at the Â£90-a-night hotel, or taking their owners for walkies up local mountain paths.

Ms Zaubek said her dachshund Alfi had always been so happy at the hotel that they decided to open it up to other dogs and add bespoke features.

The menus, created by the hotel chefs specially for the dogs, were all tested by Alfi in advance.

The gourmet selection includes roast beef with oats and carrots or baked salmon and potato.

Portions can vary depending on the size of the dog, according to Ms Friederike.

Qualified personal trainers are also on hand to teach old dogs new tricks.

The experts can help owners to gain dog licences that ensure reduced pet insurance costs and are demanded for certain breeds in parts of Austria.

It may be a dog's life for those working at the hotel, but the unusual idea looks set to pay off.
