Tributes have flowed for James Teague who died in a New Zealand hospital after falling 10 metres from a hotel balcony at ski resort in Queenstown three days ago.

The Sydney teenager, 19, died at Dunedin Hospital at midnight on Saturday after suffering a major head injury when he fell onto a concrete carpark in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Friends and family have described him as 'one of the most charismatic students' and 'an incredible young man who had such an impact'.

Mr Teague's parents were by his side in intensive care when he passed away after rushing to New Zealand on Friday following the accident.

The University of Sydney student from Paddington, Sydney's eastern suburbs, had been staying in a second-floor unit at The Glebe Apartments in the popular tourist town with four male friends, three aged in their late teens or early 20s.

The group had been drinking alcohol before he fell at 3am, police said.

Messages of support flowed in for Mr Teague after friends of the avid rugby union fan asked NSW Waratahs to pay tribute to the 19-year-old at their Saturday night clash against the ACT Brumbies.

A Waratahs spokeswoman told The Sydney Morning Herald a tribute would be read out before Saturday's 7.40pm kick-off at the Waratahs-Brumbies game.

Since then, more condolence messages for Mr Teague and his family were tweeted.

'Such a shocking loss. One of the most charismatic students I've ever had the pleasure to teach. James will be sorely missed,' Brian Jones wrote.

Josh Allerton tweeted: 'Rest in peace my brother. I'll see you on the other side. Your life was cut short, but you've left a mark on all of us. Love you.'

Mr Teague was also described as 'a son, friend, brother. An incredible young man who had such an impact' by Alex Michael.

'You will be forever in our hearts, you improved our world by being in it,' Caval tweeted.

Before the match, the team took to Twitter and wrote: 'Join us at @AllianzStadium tonight as we send our thoughts to the Teague family & Tahs fan James, who was due to be there. #ClapForJames.'

One of the man's friends thanked the team for the tribute: 'HUGE thankyou to the @NSWWaratahs for their support and help with the #ClapForJames tonight. Friends, family and i are ecstatic!! Thankyou!!'

Friends and strangers of the teenager used the hashtag, #clapforjames, to send messages of support.

'Massive thanks to the @NSWWaratahs for recognising an incredible guy and friend! #ClapForJames,' @angelaha12 wrote on Twitter.

@emrawrr tweeted: '#ClapForJames this is a beautiful notion for a beautiful boy, we love you jamesy <3'.

Some of Mr Teague's friends changed their Facebook profile pictures as a show of support.

The 19-year-old's father is Sydney psychiatrist Robert Hampshire who is described as a 'society psychiatrist', The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

He had a case brought against him by the Health Care Complaints Commission last year for seeing patients without professional indemnity insurance for 18 months in 2008-09, and for not following restrictions placed on his practice, such as only being allowed to see up to 25 patients a week.

Dr Hampshire was ordered to pay $4950, but blamed the practice's shortcomings on his blood pressure which was causing his brain to swell.

His father is well-known psychiatrist Robert Hampshire (pictured with Mr Teague in 2011), from Sydney, who was prosecuted by the Health Care Complains Commission last year
