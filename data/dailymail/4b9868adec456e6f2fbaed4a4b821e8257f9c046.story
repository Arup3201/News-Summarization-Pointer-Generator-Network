Rumor has it that a well-known British tycoon has been dropping those monster tips in Utah.

MailOnline has learned that Virgin Chairman Sir Richard Branson may be the person behind at least onee of the massive tips left in the Ogden, Utah area around August 17.

Sir Richard was in town and seen going out, according to multiple sources.

The three tips, totaling $7,000, have garnered worldwide attention as people try to figure out who left gratuities big enough to bring one server to tears and to take down a bar’s computer system.

The small town 40 miles north of Salt Lake City was abuzz last weekend when a bar patron left a $5,000 tip on a check just over $214 at a local bar named Brewski’s.

This act of kindness was followed the 
next night by a tip of $1,000 on a $49 check at Alleged, another local 
bar. The tip was so big that it had to be charged as a separate sale 
since the bar’s computer system only allows for tips up to 100 percent, 
not 2,000 per cent.

These two acts of generosity were preceded by a $1,000 tip being given to a girl running the beer cart at a local golf course. The girl was brought to tears by the gesture, according to a local paper.

Alleged owner Jared Allen, when reached by MailOnline, denied that his bar saw Sir Richard the night the large tip was dropped, but Allen did say the famous billionaire was in town that weekend.

It also has not been confirmed that only one person left all three tips.

When reached by phone at Brewski’s, a person identified only as ‘Delaney’ would not comment on the tip to MailOnline and said a manager who wasn’t in for several days would have to be reached. ‘The owners are hardly ever here,’ she added.

Brewski’s owners have not spoken to other outlets looking for comment on the tip.

Sir Richard may have been in town as part of the planning for the Summit Series, an annual conference for entrepreneurs that recently bought an entire mountain to make its home base, according to the conference’s website. Ogden is the closest town to the mountain.

'The rumor is that Branson was in town meeting with organizers of the Summit Series,' another source wrote in an email MailOnline.

A keynote speaker at the 2011 conference, Sir Richard has been said to heavily involved in planning future events.

Sir Richard is Britain's sixth-wealthiest person with a net income of $4.6billion, according to Forbes.

MailOnline was not able to reach Sir Richard or his reps for comment.
