Kris Humphries may be used to fighting in divorce court by now, but the basketball court is a different story.

The Brooklyn Nets forward was ejected - along with two other players - after a massive melee broke out during the game on Thursday night in Boston.

In the second quarter, Humphries set Celtics forward Kevin Garnet to the floor as he jumped up for a shot.

Melee: Security guards get involved in the fight as it spills out into the seats

A split-second later, Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo retaliated by charging Humphries, shoving him into the fans sitting courtside.

Nets forward Gerald Wallace leaped into Humphries' defense by joining the skirmish also.

It took less than a minute for coaches, referees and security guards to separate the players. When it was over, Rondo emerged from the pile-up without his jersey.

After looking at a replay of the dust-up, referees slapped Humphries with two technical fouls and Wallace with one. Both were ejected.

Rondo was also ordered out of the game. Later on Thursday, it was announced that he would be suspended for two games.

In addition, Wallace was fined $35,000 and Garnet was fined $25,000 for 'escalating' the fight, the NBA said late Thursday.

Referee James Capers said: 'When he 
and Humphries go into the stands, they are involved in a fight. Fighting
is an automatic ejection.'

Even without Humphries and Wallace, the Nets held on to defeat the Celtics 95-83.

Rondo left the Celtics locker room before it was opened to reporters, and was not available for comment.

Garnet told the Associated Press: 'We
all back each other. We take a lot of pride in putting 
on this jersey. I know I do. This ain't the Girl Scouts or the Boy 
Scouts. That's what it is. It's the NBA. You've got to get used to it.'

After the game, Celtics coach Doc Rivers
told reporters: 'Kevin could have gotten hurt. He's in the air. He took
a bad fall. And so Rondo saw that and probably reacted, and 
over-reacted, obviously.'

Battle wounds: After the game, Humphries posted this picture on Twitter with the caption, 'Anyone know where I can quick get a Tetanus shot in Boston?'

'I think guys just try to defend 
themselves,' Nets coach Avery Johnson said. 'I think the league should 
really take that into account. Because I don't know if guys can just 
walk away all the time. They've got to kind of protect themselves.'

Humphries kept in good humor about the situation, posting a photo of his scratched left shoulder with the caption, 'Anyone know 
where I can quick get a Tetanus shot in Boston?'

The photo was met with some criticism on the microblogging site, as one fan mocked him as 'cry baby Kris.' Another said: 'Don't mess with Boston brah... Cuz it bites back.'

Fox Sports commentator Erin Andrews tweeted: 'Really?? tweeting a post gm "scratched" arm photo from a hoops gm? have you seen the injuries NFL and NHL players get? #taketheskirtoff.'

Rage-on: Rondo, who was rejected from the game, was suspended twice last year for violence toward NBA officials

Rondo is no stranger to NBA discipline.

He was suspended for one game in the first round of last year's playoffs against Atlanta following an incident with referee Marc Davis, whom Rondo chest-bumped
while complaining about a call in the final minute of a Celtics loss.

In the 2011-12 regular season, he was suspended for two games for hurling a basketball at one of the officials.

'Usually he goes after the refs,' Rivers said. 'This was another guy, so this was better.'

While
Humphries has been playing in the NBA since 2004, the Nets power 
forward launched into national consciousness with his televised 
courtship of reality starlet Kim Kardashian.

Brief romance: Humphries was married to reality star Kim Kardashian for just 72 days in what was widely viewed as a new low for celebrity marriages. The divorce proceedings are still ongoing

The camera followed their engagement and star-studded wedding on August 20, 2011 - a ratings powerhouse for the E! network.

But it all came crashing down just 72 days later when Kardashian filed for divorce.

Humphries
fired back, petitioning for an annulment on the grounds that he was the
victim of an elaborate sham orchestrated by the Kardashian clan to 
further their own interests and products.

The spectacle was widely viewed as a new low for celebrity marriages.

While Humphries has been linked to on-again, off-again girlfriend Myla Sinanaj, Kardashian continues to get hot and heavy with rapper Kanye West, but their divorce is still not yet final.
