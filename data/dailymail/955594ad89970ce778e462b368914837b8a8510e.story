A young woman who suffered from anorexia for more than six years has beaten the eating disorder  thanks to Pilates.

Emily Sullivan, 22, suffered three heart attacks while suffering from anorexia and bulimia, a battle which started at the age of 15 and saw her weight drop to just six stone by the time she was 20.

Ms Sullivan, who says she developed an eating disorder to cope with bullying at school and the death of her grandmother, was told by doctors she only had months to live unless she changed her habits.

Back to health: Emily Sullivan, 22, from Cheltenham, Gloucester, has been able to make a full recovery from her anorexia thanks to Pilates

At her lowest point, Ms Sullivan, from Cheltenham, Gloucester, was finally admitted to hospital in November 2012 after suffering three suspected heart attacks

On being discharged, she discovered Pilates and just a few months later had become a healthy size 8.

Ms Sullivan now wants to start teaching Pilates and is studying for a diploma in to become and instructor.

‘When the bullies used to tell me I was fat and ugly, I started to believe them,’ Ms Sullivan says.

‘I broke down my own self confidence 
from then on by being negative about myself, but what started as cutting calories spiralled out of control.

‘During
 treatment I wasn’t allowed to exercise, it was seen as a negative 
because a lot of the patients would use it as a way to lose weight.

‘When I was released from day treatment I felt really uncomfortable in my body, I was exhausted, depressed and had lost all my strength. I wanted to find something new to try and I had heard about Pilates.

‘I started doing about two classes a week and I soon found not only was I good at it, but I loved it, too.

‘I finally found my drive and ambition again which is something I thought I had lost.

'I was rebuilding my body and it felt amazing. It made me happy which was something I hadn’t felt in ages.’

At just 15, Ms Sullivan at first found it easy to hide her eating disorder from her family.

She lived with her mother who was training to be a midwife and working irregular shifts, making it easy for her to skip meals.

Where it began: Emily, pictured with a friend while she was ill, began controlling her calorie intake after she was bullied about her weight in school

Low point: Emily at her thinnest. 'When the bullies used to tell me I was fat and ugly, I started to believe them,’ she says

‘But then I realised that I could eat but that I could get rid of it straight away which is when I developed bulimia.

‘I was 20 when I was finally diagnosed, but there wasn’t enough help. The waiting list for the clinic in Cheltenham was about a year. Nothing really happened until I collapsed at university.’

Ms Sullivan was referred for day treatment but instead of making her better, it just made her worse.

She said: ‘Everyone there is so thin and it made me feel like I wasn’t good enough. My body couldn’t deal with it and even when I tried to keep food down I was regurgitating it every five minutes.’

The constant throwing up had done some serious damage to her body.

A healthy person has potassium levels between 3.5 and five, but hers had fallen to just two, which put her at serious risk of heart attacks or even organ failure.

Healthy weight: More than six years after she first fell is, Emily is now fully recovered from her eating disorder, according to doctors, but says she sees it as an ongoing process

Then in November 2012, she collapsed with a suspected heart attack.

She said; ‘My whole body cramped up. I couldn’t breathe and just curled up in a ball.

‘I had another two attacks, the first by the side of the road and another one in the consultant’s office.

‘He
 just took me into a room and said "this is getting ridiculous now". He 
told me I would be dead in a month - that I wouldn’t make it until the 
end of the year.

‘I was admitted to The Priory the same day.’

Onwards and upwards: Emily is now studying to become a Pilates instructor

Ms Sullivan spent two weeks in hospital where she had to eat three meals a day 
and drink high calorie, nutritional drinks.

She was only allowed access 
to a bathroom at certain times, and even then she was supervised.

She said: ‘It was incredibly difficult, but when you reach that point you get a sense of unison with the other people there.

'You can’t not eat the meal because you’ll be letting the others down.

‘I came out after a couple of weeks. The purpose wasn’t to feed me back up again; it was to condition me into not being sick all the time.

‘I went back into day treatment but again it didn’t help.’

But shortly after leaving day treatment, while undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy, Ms Sullivan discovered Pilates.

This is a system of exercises designed to improve strength, flexibility, and posture, and enhance mental awareness.

It gave her a new lease of life and for the first time in a long she decided to actively try and get better.

She said: ‘Finding something that made me happy gave me something to focus on.

‘As well as being a Pilates instructor, I want to go into schools and talk about healthy body image - there is too much focus on weight.

‘I will never see myself as recovered. You are never fully recovered from something like this. It’s an ongoing process. Recovery isn’t an easy road; it is full of bumps and setbacks.

‘But now I have the tools to cope and the opportunity to try to be as happy as possible, make the most of life and learn to love in the skin that I am in.’
