Bellslea Hills Pet Hotel and Spa in Ayrshire has 28 suites starting from the price of £29.40  per night

Each room comes with a webcam so pets can enjoy their favourite tv show, or feel cosy with a warm crackling fire on screen

The exclusive retreat offers 38 five-star rooms, which are able to house multiple dogs from the same family if owners wish. 

Will Aitken, managing director, said: 'Bellslea Hills Pet Hotel and Spa is the first of its kind in the UK; the only comparable facilities are located in Beverley Hills and Hollywood.

'Many dog owners put on a TV for their pet when they leave the home for any period of time during the day, which is why all our suites feature TVs for dogs to watch and listen to their favourite daytime show or, alternatively, the TVs can screen an image of a crackling log fire to give the suite a warm, homely feel.'

The TVs are also equipped with webcams which have 360 degree rotation and are able to be controlled by a smart phone. 

Owners are able to talk to their pets, wherever they are in the world, with the in-built dual audio system.  

There is also an infrared function with the webcam to give 24/7 vision on the pets, which owners can watch from around the world. 

The state-of-the-art astroturf area allows your pet to get the exercise they need while you are away

The bone-shaped pool is perfect for pets to play in while they have their luxurious hotel retreat

The Scottish-based hotel and spa is thought to be the first of its kind outside of Hollywood, and opened its doors this week

When pets are not relaxing in their suites, they can take advantage of the bone-shaped splash pool, or play in the indoor state-of-the-art hygienic artificial grass play area. 

Mr Aitken said: 'As a dog lover, I know what level of care I would want for my own pets and that is precisely what we have designed Bellslea Hills to deliver. 

'I'm convinced that, like me, rather than a standard kennel, pet owners would much rather place their beloved dogs in a facility offering the highest possible quality and providing exceptional levels of care and comfort.' 

Rooms can be booked so more than one of your dogs can stay in the stay suite for company 

Pets will be pampered from the moment they arrive, and you can observe all their antics on the webcams in their room.

For the ultimate pamper treatment, pet hotel guests will be able to head to the spa to unwind after exercising. 

The luxurious spa facility allows dogs to be washed and grooms with a range of different shampoos and conditioners, including hypoallergenic and colour enhancing options with different scents. 

Dogs will be massaged by aerating showerheads or for sensitive pooches, dried in a luxury spa box with gentle warm air. 

Spa facilities can be used for non-hotel guests as well. 

Mr Aitken said: 'If you've been down to the beach with your dog, or playing in a muddy field, you can pop along to use our spa facilities and have a peek at what else we can offer your precious pooch.'

Nightly rate are £29.40 per suite for one guest and £19.40 for each additional guest from the same family. 

The Bellslea Hills Pet Hotel and Spa is located at Roodland, Ayrshire.
