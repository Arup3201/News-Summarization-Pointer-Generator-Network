Chantelle Pringle, pictured in 2008, was just two years old when surgeons amputated her right foot and all the toes from her left

A two-year-old had one foot amputated and all the toes on another removed after a nurse failed to realise she needed treatment for a serious blood infection - and instead prescribed Calpol, a court heard.

Chantelle Pringle was lethargic, short of breath and vomiting - so her mother Keeley Grotz, 33, rang the out-of-hours medical phone line for advice.

The mother from Barmston, Washington, Tyne and Wear, told a duty nurse her child's symptoms and the medic prescribed Calpol. She then told her to ring back if she still concerned.

But Chantelle, now 11, deteriorated rapidly and by the time she got to hospital she was diagnosed with bacterial blood infection septicaemia.

Days later surgeons were forced to amputate her right foot and all the toes from her left.

Ms Grotz claims the worst damage could have been avoided if her child had received immediate emergency treatment.

She is suing Nestor Primecare Services Ltd, who run the out-of-hours service, for £1million damages at London’s High Court.

Acting on behalf of the family, Lisa Sullivan told the court Ms Grotz rang the line in the early hours of November 17, 2004.

She told the nurse Chantelle was 'wobbly, vomiting and just not right' and the toddler was 'burning up', the court heard.

Miss Sullivan claims the nurse should have arranged for an emergency ambulance to be called - but instead she suggested taking Calpol, an over-the-counter paracetamol syrup.

Chantelle 'kept waking up' and her mother called an ambulance in the morning after she noticed blemishes on her legs, the court was told.

She was then taken to Sunderland Royal Hospital.

The child was put on life support and spent eight days in intensive care where her hands and feet turned black.

In a two-hour operation on December 6, surgeons removed her right foot and five toes from her left. Her family remained at her bedside until she was allowed home on December 22.

Chantelle now has a false leg.

At the time, Ms Grotz told local media said: 'She came down with a temperature and was feeling a bit drowsy - I thought it was the flu.

'I called the emergency doctor and he said to leave her until the morning. Next day, I noticed she had a few spots.

'It took a couple of minutes for the ambulance to get here. I was shaking, but they took over. I didn’t want to watch. I had to leave the bedside because it was touch and go.

Chantelle, pictured aged 9, with her friend Lucy Hale. London's High Court heard how the child was vomiting and lethargic when her mother called the phone line for advice and a medic suggested Calpol

'I didn’t know anything about septicaemia. It wasn’t until they put her on a life support machine that they told us.

'They told me if I had waited for an emergency doctor to come, she would have died.

'The first 48 hours were the most critical, whether she would pull through or not. It was just a matter of hoping she would.

'Her feet were really black and her hands were too. You could tell they were actually gone. Her hands were saved by all the stuff she was on - the nine machines around her.'

Nestor Primecare’s barrister, Gerard Boyle, said the company accepted that Chantelle 'should have seen by a GP' within two hours of her mother’s call but said the outcome would have been no different.

She told the court the earliest Chantelle could have received antibiotic treatment would have been around 3am on November 17. This, he claims, would have been too late to stop the amputations.

The hearing continues.
