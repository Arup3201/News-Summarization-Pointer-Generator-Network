It has been claimed they are not on speaking terms, even when it comes to their daughter Suri, aged eight.

Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise - who divorced in 2012 after six years of marriage - 'have bad feelings about each other,' according to a Wednesday report from TMZ.

This comes one day after People reported the 36-year-old beauty has been dating the 52-year-old super star's old friend Jamie Foxx, 47, quietly for one year, and the same day UsWeekly shared a photo of the two holding hands.

Not talking: Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise - who divorced in 2012 after six years of marriage - 'have bad feelings about each other,' according to a Wednesday report from TMZ; here they are pictured in December 2011

'They want nothing to do with each other to the point they don't speak to one another, even about Suri,' a source told the site.

It was further added that Cruise and Holmes 'do not communicate at all.'

As far as co-parenting their only child together, it was claimed by the site that they leave that up to intermediaries. 

Their only child: 'They want nothing to do with each other to the point they don't speak to one another, even about Suri,' a source told the site; here Suri, aged eight, is pictured in Calabasas in October 2014

Even planning visitations and discussing how the little girl should be raised is done through others, it was alleged.

'There is no desire on either Tom's or Katie's part to mend fences,' it was added.

It was claimed that Tom has not seen Suri 'in months' because he has been shooting Mission: Impossible 5 in London.

But his team has insisted many times since his 2012 divorce from Holmes that the Top Gun star does make time for his child and sees her often.

Reps for Cruise have not returned calls to DailyMail.

TMZ insisted that Katie is upset the Oblivion actor doesn't see their child more.

The site added he has wrapped his film and will be back in LA soon, where Katie and Suri now reside.

She moved on: It has been claimed by People, UsWeekly and TMZ that the 36-year-old actress is now dating Jamie Foxx, 47, who used to be friends with Cruise

Katie is raising their daughter in the same Calabasas neighborhood where Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian live. The former Dawson's Creek star is in LA to film her arc on TV's Ray Donovan. 

Holmes does not seem too concerned about these reports. Very early on Wednesday morning she posted to Instagram a video of herself in dance class with a male instructor.

Her caption read, 'Kicking into Wednesday! Have a great day!'

In early March the Batman Begins star shared the quote from Nelson Mandela, 'May your choices reflect your hopes not your fears.'
