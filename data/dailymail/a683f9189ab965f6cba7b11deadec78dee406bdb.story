A flat tire may be the least of a driver's problems.

Nissan is recalling more than 220,000 Nissan Altimas because a latch defect could cause the hood to fly open while the car is being driven. 

The recall only applies to 2013 models of the vehicle, but CBS Philly reports that Nissan is investigating whether other models with similar designs may be involved. 

Nissan told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that the recall affects vehicles manufactured from March 6, 2012, to February 28, 2013.

Nissan officials said that the issue has to do with an interference between the hood inner panel and the secondary latch. 

A NHTSA recall stated that the panel and latch, combined with debris and corrosion, could result in the secondary hood latch remaining in the unlatched position when the hood is closed.  

The statement went on to say that if the primary latch is accidentally released when the secondary latch is already in the unlatched position, the hood of the car could fly open and possibly result in an accident.

Nissan spokesman Steve Yaeger told the Associated Press that the defect was first discovered when there were reports of a small number of hoods flying open and damaging the cars. However, no injuries have been reported. 

Yaeger also said that as long as Nissan Altima owners don't release the main hood latch when they're driving, there shouldn't be a problem.  

To remedy the situation, Nissan is recalling 220,423 of Nissan's top-U.S. selling vehicle and will have dealers modify the car's hood actuation lever and have the latch joint cleaned and lubricated if necessary, according to the NHTSA. 

Owners may have the latch system replaced if severely damaged. All repairs are free of charge.

The company has not yet provided a notification schedule to owners.

The AP reports that the more than 220,000 vehicles include 219,000 Nissan Altimas in the U.S., 10,049 in Canada, 5,267 in Mexico, 2,042 in South Korea, and a small number in Guam, Saipan, and Latin America.
