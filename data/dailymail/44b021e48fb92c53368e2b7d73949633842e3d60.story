It is too early to talk of dressing room mutiny but Barcelona coach Luis Enrique takes his team into Wednesday night's Champions League group game against Ajax with the murmurs of discontent gradually getting louder after two straight defeats.

There is a strong suggestion that some players felt they were ill-prepared for the recent Clasico, as evidenced by French defender Jeremy Mathieu's post-match comments that he was surprised to find himself playing at left back when he had played all previous matches at centre back.

Critics have been scratching their heads at what appears to be a breakdown in communication – surely the players would having gone over and over their defensive positions in the week leading up to the game? Was Mathieu not training in that position in the last few sessions before the match?

Enrique was asked about Mathieu's comments and he snapped: 'If a player who played regularly as a left back when he was at Valencia is surprised at playing there, then we might as well all pack up and go home.'

The Frenchman is not the only one that Enrique's abrasive style may have rubbed up the wrong way.

Gerard Pique was left in the stands for the team's last match against Celta Vigo after television images showed him using his telephone on the bench in the second half of the Catalan Super Cup final.

Ever since the start of the season Pique has been left in little doubt that his place in the first team is anything but assured with Javier Mascherano and Mathieu preferred by Enrique. And the World Cup-winning defender is not the only one out of favour.

Jordi Alba was dropped for the Real Madrid game, as was Ivan Rakitic, despite being one of the outstanding performers in the first few weeks of the season. Rakitic was replaced by Xavi in the Clasico – a player who the Barca coach had largely ignored before the fixture.

Players understand that no-one's place is secured but such unpredictable swings from favouring one to to another creates a sense of instability. Enrique was emotion-driven as a player, some Barca watchers are beginning to wonder if those characteristics need to be tamed now that he is in charge of such a big club.

Not everyone is exposed to the whims of the coach. Lionel Messi was consulted about whether he felt he should be taken off in a match against Eibar earlier in the season and appeared to tell the bench that he wanted to stay on. When Enrique was criticized after the game for giving in to his talisman he made a point of taking Messi off at the end of the next match. But it seems the Argentine is the one man who does know where he stands with the Barca coach.

Unfortunately for Enrique the areas of the team where he has been quick to drop important players is precisely the area where he now needs those players to play every week.

Mathieu is ruled out for the next three matches with a calf injury and that leaves Enrique with just Mascherano, Marc Bartra and Pique as his central defensive options. 

The Argentine Mascherano is increasingly being touted as an option for a midfield that is currently shorn of the injured Andres Iniesta's talents.

Barcelona have allowed Alex Song to go out on loan and sold Thiago Alcantara and Cesc Fabregas in the last two years while only bringing in Rakitic. And sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta has also failed to remedy a squad imbalance in the centre of defence.

Thomas Vermaelen has not played for four months after breaking down at the World Cup and is not likely to feature any time soon and the decision to make him the key central defensive reinforcement looks increasingly flawed.

The club is currently in the process of appealing FIFA's decision to ban them from signing players for two transfer windows. The court of arbitration in sport will tell them in December if the sanctions will end after the next window or if the ban continues into next summer.

Whatever  the result the immediate consequences of not being about to bring in reinforcements at the turn of the year remain very much in place. Barcelona have not been fourth in the table at this stage of the season since the 2003-04 season.

It is true that they have only conceded four goals all season and they possess the world's most feared front three. But Luis Suarez, Messi and Neymar failed to muster a goal at the weekend against Celta and there is a flat and forlorn feel to the side at the moment that only midfield spark and defensive security will help shift.

On Tuesday they travelled to Amsterdam knowing that a repeat of what happened in the Dutch capital last year will only add to the sense of ensuing crisis.

Enrique's team have been set three stern tests so far this campaign and failed them all. Paris Saint-Germain beat them in France earlier in their Champions League campaign, Real Madrid turned them over in the Clasico, and Celta Vigo brought their unbeaten away record to the Nou Camp and maintained it with a 1-0 win.

Last season Barcelona suffered their first defeat of the season at the Amsterdam Arena after 20 games without a loss. The 2-1 set-back cast doubts over then coach Tata Martino. The dark clouds of uncertainty are already rolling over Enrique's head.
