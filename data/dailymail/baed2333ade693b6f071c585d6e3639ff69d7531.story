English teacher Iimaan Ismail, 22, was arrested after her husband Nur Hassan fled to Syria to fight with extremists but she has not been seen since her release.

Ms Ismail, who studied Politics, Psychology and Sociology at Cambridge after achieving two A* and one A at A-Level, allegedly hid her husband's disappearance for six months.

She had been teaching English at Chorlton High School in Manchester but quit and has not been seen since. 

A police source also said that the bright young Briton showed 'wilful blindness' over who husband's extremist ideology, which she also kept from his family. 

Nur Hassan's decision to flee Britain to fight for ISIS was only revealed when he sent a message to his brother Nasib, 15, a keen footballer who had played for Manchester United's academy sides.

Nur's father Idris, 50, who fled Somalia and came to Britain via Finland in 2005 has pledged to 'kill' the people who radicalised his son.

But despite marrying an extremist, the Oxbridge graduate worked at weekends and holidays for Waterstones in its teenage fiction department, winning part-time Bookseller of the Year in 2010.

A keen online reviewer of books, she revealed in her five-star review of the first Twilight book that she read the whole saga in just five days.

She said she 'drove my family and friends up the wall' such was her obsession and said lovers 'Bella and Edward's journey is fascinating and unforgettable'.

In court: Jamshed Javeed admitted two terror charges this week and had intended to travel to Syria with Nur Hassan but his family confiscated his passport and belongings

Her Twitter account reveals how she kept in touch with friends from home and Cambridge, discussing films like Titanic. 

But she also was in a relationship with Nur Hassan, who was from the same part of central Manchester as her. 

Her husband, who will be extradited to his native Finland if he tries to get back to Britain,  was mentioned in a terror case at Woolwich Crown Court this week.

Yesterday it emerged a young mother who loved the TV show The Only Way is Essex has run away to Syria with her baby son after becoming obsessed with extremist propaganda she found online.

Tareena Shakil, 25 – a one-time Spice Girls fan, school prefect and Girl Guide – was so fascinated with the ITV reality show that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars.

Yesterday her parents said she was wearing items she bought there when she set off for Syria, lying to her family that she was taking her 14-month-old son on holiday to Spain.

In terrifying messages home, she told them ‘so many people died’ when they ‘got shot at the border’ but that she and her son Zaheem made it because she ‘ran across’.

She is the latest young woman to travel to Syria to join Islamic State, apparently as a ‘jihadi bride’.

Twins Salma and Zahra Halane, 16, who hoped to become doctors, also ran away from their home in Manchester to Syria, where social media posts show them learning to use assault rifles.
