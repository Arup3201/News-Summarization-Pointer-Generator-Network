Italy legend Paolo Maldini says he doesn't understand Roy Hodgson's decision to leave Ashley Cole out of England’s World Cup squad.

The former AC Milan defender, who played until the age of 40, called Cole 'one of the great left backs of all time' and praised the Chelsea man for his big game performances.

Maldini, who won over 100 caps for Italy before retiring from international football in 2002, said Cole would have been one of the first players on the teamsheet if he were in charge.

World class: Ashley Cole is still one of the best in the world according to Maldini

'I don't understand': The former Italy defender says he would have taken Cole to Brazil

Maldini said: ‘Ashley Cole is one of the great left backs of all time - and I have seen nothing to suggest that he is still not one of the best in the world.

‘The coach must make his own decisions - but he would have been one of the first players I would have picked.

‘Not only for his big game experience - but for the way he performs in the big games. How many times have we seen him keep the best attacking players in the world quiet in the big games - he is a player that rises to the occasion.

Service: Cole received a commemorative 100th cap last year, but has now retired from interantionals

Replacements: Leighton Baines (left) will start in Brazil with youngster Luke Shaw (right) as back-up

Tough call: Roy Hodgson described the decision to leave out Cole as the hardest he had to make

‘It is important to have youth in the side of course - but not to take one of the players who is still maybe the best in his position in the world - I just don't understand.’

Maldini's comments come after Italy manager Cesare Prandelli claimed that he wouldn't pick a single Englishman over the players in his squad.

England will begin their World Cup campaign against Italy in Manaus on June 14.
