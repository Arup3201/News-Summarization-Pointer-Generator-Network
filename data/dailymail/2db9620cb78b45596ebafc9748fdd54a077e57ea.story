MSNBC anchor Mara Schiavocampo had a rocky experience trying to sign up for Obamacare as the insurance marketplaces opened up to a rocky start Tuesday.

The long anticipated rollout came despite the government shutdown and the snags are expected to contribute to a slow start to enrollment and give increased ammo to Obama's Republican foes.

At least 25 of the 36 federally-run, state-specific marketplace sites posted error messages soon after open enrollment began at 8am, so Schiavocampo was far from alone.

Schiavocampo described her experience in real time as she created an account at HealthCare.gov.

She created a username and password and at first the process was typical.

'Pretty much like it would be for any other website,' she said.

After she created her account, Schiavocampo moved on to step two in the process, where she entered her and her family's information.

It was at step three, when the anchor would have chosen from among Obamacare plans, when she hit a snag.

'I keep getting this error page,' she said, 'It won't let me progress.'

After two phone calls and a combined 35 minutes trying to enroll in Obamacare, Schiavocampo gave up.

'If I were signing up for myself, this is where my patience would be exhausted,' she said.

The website was showing signs of trouble handling the volume of consumers on October 1, the first day of the 
six-month open enrollment period.

Federal officials are aware of the website problems and say they are working to address it as quickly as possible.

U.S. Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters 
says officials "have built a dynamic system and are prepared to make adjustments 
as needed and improve the consumer experience."

The site for Maryland, which is running its own exchange, 
displays a message saying 'We open at 12:00 noon on October 1st.'

Other callers to the federal call center where consumers can get 
help by telephone have reported long wait times.

The federal government also announced delays for small business and Spanish-language signups.

The biggest expansion of society's 
safety net since Medicare is now in the hands of consumers, and most of 
their concerns don't revolve around ideology and policy details.

People want to know if they can afford 
the premiums, if the coverage will be solid, where the bureaucratic 
pitfalls are and if new federal and state websites will really demystify
 shopping for health insurance. Full answers may take months.

People who don't have access to job-based health insurance can start shopping right away for subsidized private policies. Or they can wait to sign up as late as December 15 and still get coverage by January 1.

Consumers also could run into problems getting their right subsidy amounts.Â 

People with complicated tax returns and extended families living under the same roof could find they need personal assistance to work out the issues. Referrals to state Medicaid programs might go smoothly in some states, not so well in others.

'As this unveils, it is going to be very clear that everything can't be done on a computer,' Christine Ferguson, director of Rhode Island's marketplace, said in an interview prior to the launch. 'But by Day 60 to 120, and the year after that, it's going to get a lot more user-friendly and effective.'

Message: Obama recorded a video message for U.S. military personnel in which he avoided blaming the GOP, saying only that 'Congress has not fulfilled its responsibility'

Eventually, at least half the nation's nearly 50 million uninsured people are expected to get coverage through the Affordable Care Act, either through subsidized private plans sold in the new markets or an expanded version of Medicaid in states accepting it for low-income adults. Immigrants in the country illegally will be the largest group remaining uninsured.

People who do have access to employer-based plans will also see changes. Starting January 1, virtually all Americans will have a legal obligation to carry health insurance or face fines. Passing up the company medical plan in exchange for a bigger paycheck may no longer be an option. But employees who lose their jobs, entrepreneurs starting their own businesses and people in between school and work could have an easier time getting coverage.

Also as of January 1, a pre-existing medical condition will no longer be a barrier to getting health insurance.

A partial government shutdown, driven by Republican opponents of increasing the federal role in health care, will not stop what they call 'Obamacare.' Core provisions and benefits are shielded from annual budget battles. If other government services are shut down, the health care overhaul can largely keep going - much like Social Security and Medicare.

'Shutdown or no shutdown we're ready to go,' Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Monday. Federally operated markets in 36 states open at 8 a.m. Eastern time. The remaining states are running their own markets.

Polls show the country remains divided over the law, with opponents outnumbering supporters. Nonetheless, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey released over the weekend found 56 percent of Americans disapproved cutting off funding to expand coverage for the uninsured, as congressional Republicans have done.

The poll also found people in a fog about what the law means for them. Nearly three-fourths of the uninsured were unaware of the new insurance markets opening to serve them.

In states not expanding Medicaid, millions of uninsured people below the federal poverty level will likely be shut out of coverage. That's the case in Texas and Florida - both of which have large uninsured populations - and in many, but not all, Republican-led states.

It's because under the law, people below the poverty line - an individual making $11,490, a family of four $23,550 - can only get the new coverage through expanded Medicaid. And the Supreme Court gave states the right to opt out.

The other arm of 'Obamacare's' coverage expansion - subsidized private insurance through the new markets - is mainly geared to uninsured people in the middle class. The administration is hoping to sign up 7 million the first year. Young, healthy adults are prime customers, since they'll help offset the cost of caring for sicker people sure to sign up once insurers can no longer reject them.

Kevin Maass of Fairfax, Virginia, has been uninsured for more than a year, since he turned 26 and could no longer stay on his parents' insurance. He's got a background in statistics that he hopes to apply to criminology, but he's been working temporary jobs while looking for permanent employment in law enforcement.

'Not having health insurance has made me a little bit more cautious,' said Maass. 'I like to snowboard, but it's given me second thoughts. Heaven forbid I should break my wrist or my arm.'

Maass thinks he might be able to afford $100 to $200 a month for insurance. Early indications are that he'll find plenty of options. However, plans with the lowest premiums will have high deductibles and copayments, which means sizable out-of-pocket costs if he gets sick or has an accident.

Nonetheless, Maass says he's definitely planning to check out the health insurance market. 'My parents have been pushing for me to get health insurance,' he said. 'I might as well at least get something rather than pay (a fine) to not have anything.'
