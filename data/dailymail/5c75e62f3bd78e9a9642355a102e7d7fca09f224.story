A beautiful week of Spring weather began in Britain today as the country basked in sunshine, above-average temperatures and dry conditions.

But temperatures have dropped to a more normal level for the season after parts of the country enjoyed their hottest weather of the year yesterday.

The mercury reached 20C (68F) for the first time in nearly six months as most of the country basked in sunshine, Met Office forecasters said.

Most other parts of England experienced warmth around 18C (64F) with East Anglia and the East Midlands enjoying the best of the sunshine.

However, although temperatures are set to fall by 5 or 6C from the weekend high, meteorologists said the coming week will remain mainly dry.

Beautiful start: A couple walk along Tynemouth Longsands on the north east coast today, as the morning sun rises. The UK is enjoying above-average temperatures

Having fun: The glorious spring weather continues today as Gracie the Jack Russell plays amongst the crocuses on display in Darlington, County Durham

Three-day outlook: Although temperatures are set to fall by 5 or 6C from the weekend high, the coming week will remain mainly dry, according to forecasters

Met Office forecaster Laura Young told MailOnline today: ‘We always said that this week was looking to see good temperatures.

‘Part of the reason people are so happy about the weather is that it's so dry. To a lot of people this feels a complete contrast to January and February.

‘In December we saw 16C, but it is lovely now. And it's nice we can give some good news. This week is going to stay settled, right through to Saturday.’

But the weather may change at the weekend, with rain possibly moving into the North as 
the high pressure system that brought the warm spell retreats.

Ms Young added: ‘More unsettled weather is coming back in at the weekend to the north of Scotland.

‘You could even see some snow in the North on higher ground. In southern parts we're looking at the odd shower.

‘Towards the end of March and the 
beginning of April, you're looking at some showers coming in - that’s 
all standard for the time of year.’

Gravesend in Kent was the 
warmest spot in the country, recording a temperature of 20.5C (69F) at 
2.30pm yesterday, according to the Met Office. The average temperature 
for March is around 12C.

The
 last time the 20C mark was breached was on October 8 last year. The 
previous top temperature of 2014 was 16.9C (62F) in London on Friday.

The
 warmer weather means racegoers attending the Cheltenham Festival in 
Gloucestershire from tomorrow do not have to pack the waterproofs and 
gloves they needed last year, when the meet was at risk from snow.

Cheltenham racecourse clerk Simon Claisse
 said that the track was going to be good to soft but was expected to 
dry out as the week progresses thanks to a dry forecast.

Making the most of it: Many parts of England experienced warmth around 18C (64F) yesterday. Day trippers are seen enjoying the sun in Brighton, East Sussex

Splashing about: From left, Summer, eight, Chloe, 10, and Cheyney, 11, cooling off in Bradford City Park yesterday, on the hottest day of the year so far

Last year bookies offered 2/1 odds that any day's racing would see a sprinkling of snow.

Mr Claisse said: ‘The forecast is for dry and warm weather to continue, though it will not be as warm (as yesterday) on Monday and Tuesday.

‘The condition of the New Course, used on Thursday and Friday, will be monitored throughout the week as it is anticipated to continue to dry out.’

The Environment Agency still had 68 flood alerts, seven warnings and one severe warning in place for parts of England and Wales.
