Most people know that a sunburn can be extremely painful and tender to touch.

So when Tiffany Sherry had her sunburned bottom slapped by her boyfriend she reacted angrily.

The 24-year-old is alleged to have stabbed her boyfriend with a steak knife, after first ordering her two children to leave the room so they would not witness the alleged assault.

According to police, Sherry grabbed a steak knife and walked towards Martinez at their home in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Sherry followed him into the living room where her two children were watching TV.

As she poked Martinez in the chest with the knife, she told the children to leave the room, officials said.

When the children left, Sherry allegedly 
stabbed Martinez in the right shoulder and upper back, yelling that she 
was going to kill him.

Martinez called police after fleeing to his home and was taken to the hospital, officials told WFMZ-TV.

Sherry was charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, making terrorist threats and reckless endangerment.

She was committed to the Northampton County Prison on $25,000 bail, according to court documents.
