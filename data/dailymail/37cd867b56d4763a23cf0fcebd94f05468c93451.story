Paul Jackson billed his school £450 a day after being hired as interim headteacher

A temporary headteacher billed his school £450 a day and installed CCTV cameras without consulting staff, according to a report.

Auditors from Manchester City Council also found five iPhones had been bought at the school without evidence of any business case when they were called in after a whistleblower raised concerns over potential financial irregularities.

An interim investigation report highlights a list of ‘significant breaches’ of the school's financial regulations after Paul Jackson was hired as interim headteacher at St Kentigern's Primary School, in Fallowfield, on a consultancy basis in September 2011.

The report found Mr Jackson was paid £124,000 for 2011/12 at a rate of £450 a day, including payments for some weekends and school holidays which were not specified in his contract.

It also found the relationship between Mr Jackson and school business manager Kathleen Inniss, who had bought two Cheshire houses together worth £474,000, was not declared.

The investigators have said more than £4,000 was also paid to Core Communications, co-founded by Mr Jackson's brother Will, for training sessions with no procurement process.

Meanwhile, Mrs Inniss bought a 'covert pen camera' using school funds and 15 high-spec ‘inward focused’ CCTV cameras were installed, without any apparent staff consultation.

The investigation also found five iPhones paid for by the school at a cost of £2,400-a-year had been allocated to Mr Jackson, Mrs Inniss, her daughter Licia, the school’s inclusion manager and chair of governors Father Tom Connolly, without evidence of any business case.

The report states that financial controls at the school were ‘significantly inadequate’ and records incomplete, leaving it open to the ‘risk of error, omission and fraud’, according to the Manchester Evening News.

An interim investigation report highlights a list of 'significant breaches' of the school's financial regulations after Paul Jackson was hired as interim headteacher at St Kentigern's Primary School, in Fallowfield, on a consultancy basis in September 2011

It said: 'In our view the numerous weaknesses in financial controls and governors not being informed of a financial relationship between the headteacher and school business manager left the school vulnerable to the risk of irregularity and allegations of failure to demonstrate or achieve value for money, making poor or perceivably favourable decisions and financial mismanagement.'

Mr Jackson, 67, had been the school’s headteacher for more than a decade before retiring in 2010.

After being re-hired, auditors found he was paid via his company Paul Jackson Consultancy Ltd and in a number of cases was able to sign-off cheques for payment from the school.

The report also states invoices on behalf of the company were often prepared by Mrs Inniss using school computers.

Auditors raised concerns that governors had not been made aware of the scale of payments.

Investigators were called in on June 21 last year when a number of concerns regarding the voluntary-aided Catholic school were raised to the town hall.

Mr Jackson retired for a second time on June 24 along with Fr Connolly, who stepped down from his role as chair of governors.

Mrs Inniss agreed to take ‘time off’ on the same day and Ms Inniss, 36, had already left on maternity leave. Both left their roles after being suspended several weeks later.

Investigators found Mrs Inniss made three unreported and unauthorised visits to the school on June 23, 24, and 25 outside of school hours - and was joined by Mr Jackson on the 23 and Ms Inniss on the 24.

It was later discovered Mr Jackson and Mrs Inniss’s email accounts had large gaps in them and further investigation found the messages were deleted on June 23 and 24.

Links between Mr Jackson and London-based training company Core Communications are also being probed.

The council investigation found the headteacher did not declare the co-founder of the company was his brother, Will, and there was no evidence of a procurement process.

Paul Jackson even appears on the ‘About Us’ section of the company’s website, although it is not clear if he held a position with the firm at the time any contracts were awarded.

A final report will be published later this year after information has been provided from third parties, including grant providers and suppliers.

Mr Jackson could not be reached for comment and Core Communications failed to respond to calls.

A member of Kathleen and Alicia Inniss’s family said the pair did not wish to respond to the findings of the report.

Fr Connolly denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of an iPhone being allocated to him by the school.

He said: 'The council has never forgiven us for when we decided to become grant-maintained many years ago and I think this investigation is their revenge for that.'

Manchester council said it would not comment on the investigation until the final report is completed.
