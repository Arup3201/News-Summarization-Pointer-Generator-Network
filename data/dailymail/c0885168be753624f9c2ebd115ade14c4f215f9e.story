Here's one final picture of the Scot in his new role...

And that’s it. Not a single question from the floor about Manchester United. Suspect there will be when he speaks separately to the English media now.

I think Moyes will be hoping his pre-match press conferences aren’t this long. 70 minutes this one.

‘I’m not sure many British coaches have been offered too many opportunities.

‘But I’ve been given an opportunity to come here and I think it’s right for me. They’ve got a bit of Britishness in this part of the world. John Toshack came here and did a brilliant job. I hope I can add to that.

‘I will add staff in time. I can’t tell you how many people want to come and work here. I can't tell you how many players want to come and work here.’

‘I want to come here and stand on my own feet. I want to show I can work here. I need help with the people here. I will add to my staff as time goes on. But it’s easier to see what I need, make a more informed decision, once I can see what I need.’

‘I’ve enjoyed Zubieta. There’s thing I will change. I look forward to bringing my methods. I think one of my strengths is working on the field. The one direction we have to go is up the league.’

‘There were never any doubts but a family decision had to be taken. It was just making sure the family was supportive and everyone was looking forward to coming to live in San Sebastian. I had great support from my wife, my dad and my children.’

‘Yes, I have had several opportunities to go back into management. But I felt I needed the break.

‘I really hope my side will show personality. A lot of flexibility and attacking options. I am a fan of football. I want to entertain.

‘But I also want to win, and in the end I care more about winning than anything else. The job here is to win.’

‘I am planning to meet him next week. I’ve met him before when I played him in the Champions League and when I went up to watch them at Aberdeen. If he’s fine with it I’d like to meet him.’

'I have to assess the players we have here first. But the transfer window is five or six weeks away and the president and the sporting director have said they will do all they can to help me.’

‘I had the choice. The president gave me the opportunity. But I had a six-year contract at United and I lasted nine months. So don’t get too caught up in the length of the contract. I don’t pay much attention to that.’

'Probably more Mourinho. I’m tough with them, I work hard. I had 11 great years at Everton and I took over a club very similar to this and we grew it and got better and better. I’m hoping I can do exact the same here and all the vibes, all the messages, say I can.’

So far so good for Moyes here. Saying all the right things.

‘It’s got a great history. It's one of the big clubs. I want to work at a big club. I want to get success. It’s a chance to work with the good people here but I also think it’s a good team.

'The attraction was the club, the team, and the opportunity to work in such a great country in a great league.’

'Mikel Arteta told me I was a lucky man coming to a beautiful city and a great football club. He spoke very highly about the academy. He was very positive about the club.’

‘I see the players being better than what they are showing at this time. I think there’s more they can give. The first objective is to avoid relegation but my expectations are high and I want a winning team.’

‘Me and the president have had some long conversations. But I had to be sure I was climbing to a club with ambition, because I want to win. We’ve only won two games this season but hopefully we can improve on that. I see great morale among the players since I’ve been here and I think I have been lifted by the result they had last Sunday.’

We are now hearing a run of questions for the club's president, with the translator whispering what is being said in the new manager’s left ear.

‘I knew a lot about Real Sociedad from a long time back. I came here in 1982/83. I was with Celtic when we played Real Sociedad. I know all about the club, about the city. I also went to see La Real in Aberdeen when they qualified for the Europa League. I’m looking forward to getting stuck right into the job. I feel the job fits my character.’

‘Real have had a great history of having British managers. John Toshack and Chris Coleman. And some of the greatest British managers have come and worked in La Liga. Bobby Robson and Terry Venables. I’m not putting myself at their level but this is an opportunity to test myself against the best and hopefully I can do well here.’

'La Liga has overtaken the Premier League because of the quality of the teams getting regularly into the latter stages of the Champions League.’

'You know it's not my style.'

'I never had any doubt. I had several offers to manage in the Premier League. I spoke to several clubs in other leagues. But the only club that pulled me was Sociedad.'

'I'm well rested I've had six months off, I'm ready.'

'It was a big ambition of mine to manage abroad. To be completely fulfilled as a coach you need to try all the cultures.'

'What convinced me was the (club's) president. He was fantastically passionate about his club: how special it is, his love for the club pulled me.'

Carlos Vela - sound familiar? Estaban Granero - ever heard of him? Moyes will have two former Premier League players to take charge of in the form of the one-time Arsenal and QPR players.

Fair play to Real Sociedad. They’ve found an Australian chap to translate Moyes from English to Basque and then Spanish, and everyone else from Basque, to Spanish and then English. At least I think that’s what’s happening. The poor chap just asked us if there’s a distinction between ‘head coach’ and ‘manager’. 

(Er, looks like this could get rather complicated...)

... we'll be hearing from Mr Moyes live in the next few minutes.

There is a genuine sense of excitement here. A feeling that they have landed a seriously big fish for their modest football club. This morning the local paper devoted 10 pages to Moyes, including an interview with John Aldridge. Comments from my good self were rather less prominent, it has to be said.

After arriving at the club's Zubieta training ground on Wednesday, Moyes ran the rule over his new players, and was spotted talking on the phone while wearing a big grin. Hello, is that Marouane...?

Moyes had better get used to smaller crowds: While Old Trafford holds a mighty 75,000 supporters, Sociedad's Anoeta Stadium has a capacity of 32,000 and last season's average attendance was around 22,500.

Conference room filling up here but reports of 100 English journalists something of an exaggeration. I count seven.

For Moyes it is that the Sociedad hierarchy have asked their new manager to mould the club in the image of Everton: a tough, streetwise team built on a base of young players and barqain buys. CLICK HERE to read more from our chief sports reporter MATT LAWTON on the task facing Real's new boss in this beautiful corner of Spain.

When Moyes was sacked by Manchester United just seven months ago, did you anticipate that his next job would be in La Liga? Not at a high-flying club either - a struggling club from the Basque country, where money is tight and the squad is reliant on youth players. It's quite a challenge facing Moyes - although his track record at Preston and Everton shows it may be a situation that suits the 51-year-old down to the ground.

You might be more familiar with the usual greeting of 'hola' in Spain but in the Basque country the above means hello. Moyes gives his first press conference as Real Sociedad manager at 4pm today, and we'll bring you the best of what the Scot tells the media after accepting the top job at La Liga's 15th-placed club.
