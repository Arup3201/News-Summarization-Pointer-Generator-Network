In a fitting tribute to the star of hit movie The Hunger Games, actress Jennifer Lawrence has been immortalised as a 5ft 10in-high cake.

The 24-year-old star was the inspiration for the incredible winning entry at last week's Cake International contest in Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre.

Lara Clarke, from Walsall, took two-and-a-half months preparing her masterpiece for the baking competition, with the sponge cake requiring 150 eggs, 22lb of flour and 22lb of butter.

Lara Clarke said she had chosen to bake a replica of Lawrence - in full Hunger Games mode - because she was a 'massive fan' of the films

It is the second time Ms Clarke has triumphed with a Hollywood theme, having won last year with a Johnny Depp cake.

She said she found her second consecutive success 'hugely exciting'. 

Ms Clarke also won silver in the large decorative exhibit section at the competition, with a cake based on her favourite Game of Thrones character Tyrion Lannister.

During her two-and-a-half months of working on the cakes, Ms Clarke researched the actress's height, waist and bust measurements online and claims the 5ft 10in (1.7m) cake is exactly life-sized

She spent two-and-a-half months working on the cakes ahead of the competition at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre.  

When asked what she planned next year, she said she'd need a 'long lie down' before deciding.

How about a Victoria (Beckham) sponge or a Christopher Eccles-ton cake?
