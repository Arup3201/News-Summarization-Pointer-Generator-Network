A pensioner who spent a night queuing in freezing rain for the post-Christmas sales has been taken to hospital with hypothermia.

The 74-year-old woman began lining up outside Silcox, Son and Wicks 
store in Bath, Somerset, 
at 4.30pm yesterday but was rushed off for treatment when the owners arrived at 8am this morning.

She was just one of 13.3 million people estimated to have
 turned out for the start of the clearance sales - up two per cent 
year-on-year, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR).

Not even the threat of a fierce storm and
 lashing rain could deter ardent bargain-hunters from hitting the shops 
for yet another post-Christmas spending spree.

Nearly £2.2 billion is expected to be spent in sales across the UK - matching the amount splashed out on Boxing Day.

The CRR said £2.2 billion was spent in 
stores yesterday - five per cent up on last year.

Steven Madeley, centre director for St David's in Cardiff, said he expected the shopping centre to be even busier than Boxing Day.

'The sales got off to a great start in Cardiff yesterday, with over 150,000 bargain hunters visiting us at St David's,' he said.

'Today and tomorrow are likely to be even busier as stores open for longer and retailers begin to slash prices even further.

'We think up to 200,000 shoppers will visit us today and shoppers could spend up to £2 million.'

Meanwhile, managers at Cabot Circus in Bristol were predicting around 100,000 shoppers would hit the Christmas sales.

Centre director Stephanie Lacey said: 'Today should be one of the busiest days of the sale and we're expecting around 100,000 shoppers at Cabot Circus.

'Boxing Day was very successful for us as key retailers like Harvey Nichols and Next went into sale.'Customers were queuing outside Next from 3am.'

But the heavy rain and gales could put many shoppers off the High Street or venturing out at all. Instead, record numbers are expected to turn to the internet instead.

The CRR estimates that up to £370 million was spent online on Boxing Day, which could rise to £450 million today.

Joshua Bamfield, director of the CRR, 
said: 'Depending on the weather, we might get 13.5 million people going 
shopping today, but we think the storms will mean people only go for a 
short time and could head home early.'

Bosses at one of Europe's biggest shopping centres were bracing themselves another rush today following the Boxing Day surge.

Annabel
 Clementson, spokesman for Bluewater shopping centre, in Kent, said: 
'It’s business as usual at Bluewater today and we anticipate another 
busy day.'

Despite the weather, the rush for 
women to buy figure altering Shapewear underclothing in time for their 
New Year's parties is already in full swing.

Sales
 have risen by 98 per cent since Boxing Day and have been on the increase
 all week, according to Debenhams.

Many
 keen shoppers started queuing before dawn yesterday to ensure they were
 first in line when the shops opened, with international tourists 
spending big.

Tax-free shopping experts Global Blue 
said shoppers from Qatar spend the most on average per transaction 
(£1,714), followed by those from the United Arab Emirates (£1,372), 
although Chinese shoppers are the biggest spenders overall.

They spend £1,367 on average per transaction, but are more likely to return to the tills with more goods.

An
 increasing number of shoppers went online to begin searching for early 
bargains on Christmas Day, with CRR predicting £250 million was spent 
over the internet.

Department store group John Lewis said it saw a 19per cent rise in Christmas Day sales - with a record 76per cent of orders made on smartphones and tablet computers.

The group, which releases its five-week trading update on January 2, said sales in the week to December 21 were up 4.2per cent on last year at £164.4 million - breaking the £160 million mark for the first time.

Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The initial healthy news reinforces the suspicion that the clearance sales will be strong this year - at least early on - as still squeezed consumers will be extremely keen this year to take advantage of genuine bargains in the clearance sales.'

But he added: 'Interest in the sales could fall away pretty quickly once the best of the bargains have gone. This would put pressure on retailers to cut prices even more, thereby further hurting their margins.'
