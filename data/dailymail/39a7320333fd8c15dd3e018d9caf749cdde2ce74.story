Rising political star and Tea Party favorite Rand Paul announced backing for more lenient marijuana laws, saying it would be a 'mistake' to throw offenders in jail.

Speaking during an interview on Sunday, Paul said that he's not necessarily for marijuana legalization, but believes prison sentences for such a crime should be significantly reduced.

He says he's currently working on legislation with Sen Patrick Leahy for 'mandatory minimums.'

Pot's punishment: Paul says that he doesn't want to promote marijuana use, but he doesn't want to throw people in jail for making that mistake

Paul told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace: 'I don't want to promote that but I also don't want to put people in jail who make the mistake.

'There are a lot of young people who do this and then later on in their 20s, they grow up and get married and they quit doing things like this, I don't want to put them in jail and ruin their lives.'

He added: 'There are people in jail for 37, 50, 45 years for nonviolent crimes. And that's a huge mistake. Or prisons are full of nonviolent criminals.'

I don't want to encourage people to do it. I think even marijuana is a bad thing to do. I think it takes away your incentive to work and show up and do the things that you should be doing. I don't think it's a good idea.

Invoking reported drug use of President Obama and George W. Bush, Paul went on: 'Look, the last two presidents could conceivably have been put in jail for their drug use, and I really think, you know, look what would have happened, it would have ruined their lives.

'They got lucky, but a lot of poor kids, particularly in the inner city, don't get lucky. They don't have good attorneys, and they go to jail for these things and I think it's a big mistake.'

Paul gained national acclaim among conservatives earlier this month when he performed a 13-hour filibuster objecting to the administration's targeted drone strike policy.

Boosted by that notoriety, Paul put himself in the forefront of early presidential candidate speculation by winning this year's CPAC straw poll with 25 per cent of the vote.

He addressed that speculation during the Fox News Sunday interview as well, saying: 'Well, I'm definitely being part of the debate. I think the country is suffering right now, with 12 million people out of work. So I want to be part of the answers to it.

'Whether or not that actually is me, specifically, running for president, I don't know that yet.'

Paul's father, former Texas Rep Ron Paul, won the poll twice in recent years and has had his own unsuccessful bids for the presidency.
