Getting your dog spayed or neutered is accepted as being part of a responsible pet owner.

But two studies suggest that the  surgical procedure could increase the long-term risk of certain cancers in canines.

A  study conducted in 2013 found a link between neutering in Golden Retrievers and incidences of cancers including osteosarcoma, mast cell cancer and hemangiosarcoma.

Researchers from the University of California-Davis studied hospital records of 759 dogs between the age of one and eight years old.

They found that three times as many early neutered males were diagnosed with lymphosarcoma – the third most common cancer in dogs – as unneutered males.

And the percentage of late-neutered females, at eight per cent, was four times more than intact and early-neutered females.

Another study, published in 2014, focused on connections seen in the Vizsla breed and was based on a voluntary internet study for 2,505 dogs born between 1992 and 2008, Scientific American reported.

Scientists from Binghampton University, State University of New York, found correlations between spayed and neutered Vizlas and mast cell cancer, lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma - cancer of blood vessel lining.

Neutered Vizslas (stock image) were also found to be more likely to develop behaviour disorders

Dogs that had undergone the procedure were also more likely to have behaviour disorders, such as storm anxiety and the younger they were spayed or neutered, the earlier these problems may show, according to the study, which was published in the American Veterinary Medical Association's journal.

However the researchers said that more research is needed to confirm their findings.

Commenting on the study in a blog post, Dr Stephen Birchard, of Circle City Veterinary Speciality Hospital, in Indianapolis, Indiana, wrote: 'Of course the benefits of spay and neuter, such as controlling dog and cat populations and the many other medical benefits currently outweigh the adverse effects. 

‘But this study shows that we need to maintain a healthy level of surveillance of the potential adverse effects of gonadectomy and attempt to determine: is this association between cancer and spay/neuter true for all breeds, even mixed breeds, and what is the pathophysiology behind it.’

Phil Robinson, Veterinary Surgeon at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, told MailOnline: 'Our main reason for neutering is to prevent the dogs from being used for breeding.

One medical benefit of neutering is the prevention of prolonged seasons leading to potential womb infection in older age. 

'There are lots of reasons to support neutering, but it’s impossible to say for sure whether neutering or not neutering your dog causes cancer.

While the results of the two studies may sound bleak, Jessica Perry Hekman, a PhD student at the University of Illinois, noted that the Golden Retrievers studied in the 2013 paper were referred to an expensive, specialist hospital, so it does not take into account animals that have not been given the very best care from their owners. She said the research is biased in its selection.

Neutering is the removal of all or part of an animal's reproductive organs.

Vets and animals charities recommend the procedure to prevent the births of unwanted litters of puppies and cats.

Behaviours such as mounting and urine spraying, as well as some forms of male aggression, can be stopped because of the reduction in hormone levels in neutered animals.

There is weak evidence that spaying reduces the risk of mammary tumours in female dogs.

The risk of ovarian cancer and testicular cancer is removed, because the animals no longer have these organs.

However, animals are at risk of complications from the procedure itself.

Spaying and neutering cats may boost the risk of obesity, because a decrease in sex hormone levels is associated with an increase in food intake.

Researchers claim that neutered dogs are at a two-fold excess risk to develop osteosarcoma (bone cancer) as compared to intact dogs.

Studies of cardiac tumours in dogs showed that there was a 5 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma - cancer of blood vessel lining - in spayed females than intact females and a 2.4 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma in neutered dogs as compared to intact males.

The 2014 paper may be flawed in the same way, she explained, because although data was collected online, the survey was probably filled in by diligent dog owners who had seen it on canine-focused online communities.

Owners also filled in their dog’s medical history, so it may not be accurate.

‘The studies both have their limitations, which makes their findings difficult to trust or generalise to other populations of dogs,’ she said.

Another 2013 study by the University of Georgia, based on data from a number of referral hospitals, found that spayed and neutered Golden Retrievers,  lived longer on average than those with their reproductive organs kept intact.

They found that dogs with their genitals intact were more likely to die of trauma or infectious diseases, while those that had been neutered were more susceptible to cancer or immune-mediated diseases.

The experts concluded that while spayed and neutered dogs were more likely to get cancer, it didn’t automatically shorten their lifespans.

The study suggests that animals that had had the procedure lived long enough to get cancer, while those that did not, were more likely to die younger without reaching the time in life where the risk of cancer rises.
