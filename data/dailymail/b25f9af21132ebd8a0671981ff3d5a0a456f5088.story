With Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo heading towards 30, the look-out is on for a new generation of stars to make football glamorous into the next decade.

Neymar and Gareth Bale spring to mind and if last night’s dazzling display in the Maracana is anything to go by, Colombia’s James Rodriguez could end up the likeliest lad of all.

The 22-year-old had a growing reputation before this tournament – after his two brilliant goals against Uruguay the hype is now ready to go through the roof.

Football's next superstar? James Rodriguez has lit up the World Cup so far

Usurped... for now: He currently sits ahead of Lionel Messi in the race for the Golden boot

Back home: And Cristiano Ronaldo, who has already gone back to Portugal, managed just one

His stunning first rivalled Tim Cahill for volley of the tournament. The second was all about striker’s instinct following a good team move.

Put simply, the reason it’s Colombia - and not Uruguay – who will face Brazil in the World Cup quarter-final is down to one man. For that, we should all be grateful to him.

There was a bit of head-scratching when Monaco paid £37million for Rodriguez a year ago. Now we know what all the fuss is about.

Given the No10 shirt for the World Cup, Rodriguez opted to put his first name, James (pronounced Ham-ez) on the back, no doubt to the delight of his marketing men. 

Having scored in all of his group games against Greece, Japan and Ivory Coast, yesterday was the real test against opponents who know how to defend and were highly motivated after the Luis Suarez furore. He passed it with flying colours.

Uruguay defended stoutly for 28 minutes.  Then, Rodriguez found a little pocket of space outside the penalty area – and that is all he needed.

As Abel Aguilar cushioned a header into his path, he took a perfect first touch on his chest, serenely swivelled 180 degrees and sent a dipping left-foot volley that dipped neatly under the crossbar.

An exquisite finish and he even had the presence of mind to lead the hip-swivelling goal celebration afterwards that is a tribute to Colombia’s other famous export, Shakira.

His second goal after 50 minutes killed Uruguay’s hopes. To prove his range, this was simple and deadly, a ghosted run into the penalty area to convert Juan Cuadrado’s headed assist from close range, this time with his right foot. A brilliant team goal.

Every big club in Europe, the Premier League’s top guns included, will want Rodriguez now. He leads the race for the World Cup golden boot with five goals.

The only other player to have scored in every game is Messi. Rodriguez has a long way to go but one day he may take the Argentine’s crown as the best in the world.
