Almost 60 per cent of workers are failing to meet the requirements of their job within the first two years of being employed.

New research released by The Search Party - an Australian recruitment technology company - found 56 per cent of employees hired were not meeting the occupation's demands after two years at a company.

It also found that 50 per cent of employers were compromising on candidates because their existing hiring processes were too lengthy and 54 per cent could not get someone who met the job specifications.

A new survey has found 56 per cent of employees hired are not meeting the demands of a job two years after joining the company

One of the study’s respondents said despite knowing a candidate was being dishonest about their experience they still hired them because they were desperate for a hire.

The study was commissioned by The Search Party, but was carried out by independent researcher PureProfile in June.

It surveyed more than 500 Australian managers across a variety of industries - including finance and banking, information technology, local government, engineering, media and hospitality.

The research also showed almost half - 44 per cent - of the recruitment processes took more than two months, having a significant impact on business productivity and efficiency.

'The lack of an effective process to solve Australia’s recruitment headache is impacting all organisations – they are making do with sub-optimal talent,' The Search Party CEO Ben Hutt said.

'Bad hires have a huge impact on the productivity of a business and at a macro level, we know productivity in Australia has been falling since 2007, which just isn’t sustainable.'

The study also found the top method used to seek out candidates was through online job websites, like Seek (pictured), with 56 per cent using this process

Mr Hutt said to combat the issue uncovered by the research, organisations needed to change their approach to the hiring process.

'For too long the market has made do with a broken process and it’s time we addressed this head on,' he said.

'A 2013 PWC study of CEOs revealed that 77 per cent of firms are currently changing their talent strategy in response to this issue, so the appetite is there for change.

'We believe collaborative approaches, which combine best of breed recruiters, with verified, high calibre candidates, backed by a reliable and effective technology platform are likely to be the winners in this race. 

'The market is now very competitive, so organisations need to evaluate and rethink their strategies and the tools they use to attract candidates in high demand.'

But it seems managers already know they have to change their hiring strategies, with 70 per cent believing they should spend more on solving the issue. However only one in five were willing to increase their budgets over the next 12 months.

The study also found the top method used to seek out candidates was through online job websites, with 56 per cent using this process.
