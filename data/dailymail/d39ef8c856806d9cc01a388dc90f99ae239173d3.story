Britain’s resurgent economy is now bigger than it was before the great recession struck, figures showed yesterday.

Gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – increased 0.9 per cent between March and May, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.

The growth spurt meant output was 0.2 per cent higher at the end of last month than it was at the pre-recession peak of January 2008.

Analysis by the economic think tank NIESR shows the UK economy has returned to its pre-crash peak, but only after six years 

Experts at NIESR hailed it a ‘symbolic milestone’ for the UK as the longest slump on record finally came to an end.

Output crashed by 7.2 per cent between 2008 and 2009 and it has taken more than six years for the losses to be clawed back.

But
 Britain is now on track for its best performance since before the 
crisis, with the Bank of England expecting growth of 3.4 per cent this 
year.

A separate report by the Office for National Statistics, which will release official figures at the end of the month, also 
showed that British manufacturing is growing at the fastest pace for 
nearly four years.

It came after figures showed growth of 1.1 per cent from February to April.

'By this estimate, the level of UK has surpassed its pre-recession peak, and is approximately 0.2 per cent above where it was in January 2008,' NIESR said.

The recessions from 1920-24 and 1930-34 took almost four years to recover from.

After the 1990-93 recession, which saw unemployment soar and riots in the streets, it took just 30 months to reverse the economic contraction.

By contrast, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, with taxpayers bailing out British banks, the economy shrunk by 7.4 per cent compared with its pre-crash high.

The recovery only really took hold in the last 18 months, with steady and sustained growth. 

Mr Osborne is expected to use his Mansion House speech on Thursday to insist that more needs to be done to secure the recovery, including tackling Britain's debt mountain.

He will unveil plans to make it easier for developers to build on brownfield sites being held by public bodies, warning the only way to deal with soaring property prices is to build more homes.

The symbolic moment will be welcomed by Chancellor George Osborne, who has warned 'the job isn't done'

Also yesterday, the Office for National Statistics said factory output rose 2 per cent between February and April – the strongest three month performance since the Coalition came to power in May 2010. 

David Cameron wrote on Twitter: 'Manufacturing output is up 4.4 per cent year-on-year. More factories making more goods means more jobs. Our long-term economic plan is working.'

The UK was hit by one of the largest slumps among the world's leading economies, and has taken a long time to recover. 

Among the G7 group of major nations, only Italy is still below its peak seen before the crash.

After being in the economic doldrums for many months, the UK economy is growing faster than most major economies – and crucially is not relying on consumer spending to fuel the boom.

Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said at the weekend: ‘It is growth is fuelled both by consumption but also now investment, but not just public investment as we recommended earlier on, but also with private investment.

‘Exports is lagging behind a little bit, but those two big cylinders of growth, consumption and investment, are fuelling growth, which in our view makes it more sustainable than if it was fuelled exclusively by consumption as was feared a few months back.’

She warned risks remained on low productivity and rising housing prices, but asked if there was a property boom in Britain, Miss Lagarde replied: ‘No. What our team has clearly seen and acknowledged is that the housing market in the UK is multi-faceted.’
