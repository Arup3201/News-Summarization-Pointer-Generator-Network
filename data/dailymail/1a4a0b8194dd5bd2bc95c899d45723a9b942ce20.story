She was born so tiny, that doctors held out little hope for her survival.

But now Annabel Hately, who was once barely the size of a Biro, has celebrated the first birthday medics feared she would never see.

Annabel weighed just 1lb 5oz when she was delivered 12 weeks early in July last year.

Rachael Hately, 40, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, was even told at her 20-week scan if Annabel did not reach one pound in weight she would have to have an abortion.

The mother-of-two Rachael said: 'They told me and my husband Neil we were having a girl and took measurements.

'The hospital told us she hadn't grown as much as they would've liked and her limbs were really small.

'I needed weekly checks at the time as my placenta wasn't feeding her properly.

'If Annabel didn't reach one pound in weight they would consider a termination because she had little chance of survival.

'I asked the consultant whether there was anything I could do and he said there wasn't.

'When I got home I read forums online and other mums who were going through the same thing said they their babies had gained weight by eating more protein and healthier options.

'So I started eating more to try and pile on the weight and even though she put on some, it wasn't enough.'

NHS researcher Ms Hately was forced to give birth 12 weeks early by caesarean section after Annabel stopped growing in the womb.

She stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for eight weeks until she reached 3lb 7oz, while friends and family helped look after her and husband Neil's other daughter Eleanor, now five.

Ms Hately said: 'People can't believe the transformation now she is one-years old.

'She now fits into size nine to 12 month clothes, so she is still about three months behind but she's slowly catching up.

'We didn't have any problems with Eleanor so we were surprised at what happened.

But now the little girl has celebrated her first birthday with her family

'We want to say a big thank you to everyone who helped us at the hospital. Throughout the whole process the staff were just fantastic.'

Dr Charlotte Groves, consultant neonatologist at the hospital, said: 'It's lovely to see Annabel is thriving following her premature start to life.

'It's always gratifying to receive positive feedback from parents regarding the care their baby received while on the neonatal unit, as having, as having a small premature baby in a neonatal intensive care unit is often stressful.'

To celebrate Annabel turning one, the family laid on a special birthday bash.
