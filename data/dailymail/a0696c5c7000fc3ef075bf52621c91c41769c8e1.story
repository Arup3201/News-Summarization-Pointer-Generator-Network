Jonny Sexton helped Racing Metro to a narrow win against 2011 Heineken Cup finalists Northampton Saints.

The Ireland international kicked two penalties and a conversion and had a big hand in Racing’s only try to get their European campaign started with a victory.

Racing have never got out of the pool stages of Europe’s premier club cup competition but ground out a deserved win on Saturday.

George Pisi had Saints’ best chance to steal a victory in the second half but they will now need to beat the Ospreys at home next weekend to get their campaign back on track.

Racing took the lead when Sexton pinned Saints right back in their own half with a well-struck kick.

Saints lost the line-out five metres from their own line and, having shifted the ball out wide, centre Alexandre Dumoulin was bundled over.

Outside-half Stephen Myler brought Saints back to within four points with a penalty after 30 minutes as the visitors managed to weather a period of pressure.

A second Sexton penalty three minutes before the interval took Racing’s lead back to seven points but Myler again reduced the deficit with a penalty at the beginning of the second period.

Racing went down to 14-men when prop Julien Brugnaut saw yellow after taking a scrum down and shortly after this, Pisi intercepted a pass and raced clear only to drop the ball 10 metres from the line because of an apparent hamstring injury.

But Sexton added a penalty 11 minutes from time to secure the win for Racing at the start of the campaign.
