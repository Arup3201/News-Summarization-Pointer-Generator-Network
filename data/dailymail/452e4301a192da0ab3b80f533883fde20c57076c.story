Bless the mournful-looking Rottweiler that Battersea Dogs & Cats Home feared was too sad to find a home has finally been given new owners.

The six-year-old was found on the streets of London and had become the home's longest-staying resident after staff believed a lack of interest was down to her permanently sad expression.

But now the Rottweiler-cross has been re-homed with Geoff and Sylvia Shoesmith from Chelmsford in Essex, who were drawn to her loving personality and calm temperament.

Mr Shoesmith said: ‘She's fantastic, I can't fault her.

‘She's got that sort of face that never gives much away - but as soon as you put your coat on and it's time to take her out, then she positively bounces!’

Bless had spent five months being overlooked by visitors at the charity’s south London Home before staff published an article on their website about the ‘permanently sad dog’.

It was after seeing the media coverage that Mr and Mrs Shoesmith leapt at the chance to take the doleful dog home.

Rob Young, head of Dog Rehoming, described her as having a ‘heart of gold’ and a ‘gentle giant’.

Staff had hoped that Bless would attract as much interest as the mournful kitten, who became an internet sensation earlier this year.

The sad cat became popular after its owner Ashley Herring, 21, from New Orleans, posted photos to the internet.

Battersea's previous longest-staying resident was Shadow, a lurcher, who was homeless for 260 days.

Like 46 per cent of Battersea dogs, Shadow was brought in by his owners after they could no longer care for him.

After a desperate plea by the charity, he was rehomed with Nigel Andrews and his daughters from Suffolk. 

The charity takes in 9,000 unwanted or lost dogs every year and the average dog stays for 35 days.
