A Florida doctor whose close relationship with New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez is under investigation by federal prosecutors bills the most for Medicare in the country - and was paid a staggering $20.8 million by the program in 2012.

Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, whose offices were raided twice by the FBI last year, received the biggest sum from Medicare, a study of physician data has revealed.

He was among a tiny group of doctors -  344 physicians out of more than 825,000 - who were paid $3 million or more apiece that year, totaling at nearly $1.5 billion.

The eye-watering sums were revealed by an Associated Press analysis of physician data that was released on Wednesday by the Obama administration. The release was part of a move to open the books on health care financing to allow patients to make informed choices about their treatment.

The second highest biller was Asad U. Qamar, a 
cardiologist in Ocala, Florida, who received $18.1 million, mostly from 
putting in stents. A New Jersey pathologist received $12.6 million 
performing tissue exams, and a Michigan vascular surgeon took in $10.1 
million.

Some of the highest
 billing totals may be because a doctor has an unusually large number of
 Medicare patients, but in some instances, the high totals could signal 
fraudulent doctor behavior.

Among doctors accused of such conduct is Detroit cancer doctor Farid Fata, the seventh highest biller among the Medicare data.

He received $10 million in Medicare payments in 2012 and is now awaiting a fraud case, after he was accused of intentionally misdiagnosing illnesses and ordering treatments for people who did not have cancer. He has denied any wrongdoing.

The doctor who received the highest payout from Medicare in 2012 - a staggering $20.8 million - has been a key figure in two different federal investigations.

Dr Salomon Melgen, a 59-year-old ophthalmologist, had his South Florida offices raided by the FBI twice last year, in January and October.

The FBI launched an investigation against him after he was accused of overbilling by taking one batch of medication and giving it to multiple patients, billing each one individually. Federal rules stated that any medication left over from a single patient was supposed to be thrown out. Melgen denied any wrongdoing but was forced to pay back $9 million he was accused of overbilling.

His generous political contributions and close relationship with New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez are also under investigation by federal public corruption prosecutors. Dr Melgen, who has said the senator is 'like a brother' to him, has donated more than $700,000 to the senator's PAC. He also allowed him to use his private jet for trips to the Dominican Republic, but the senator was forced to pay back the cost of the travel.

Melgen moved to Florida from the Dominican Republic in the late 1970s and lives in a 5,000 square foot home in North Palm Beach.

Medicare data shows that he billed mostly for Lucentis, which is used to treat blocked blood vessels in the eye. It is made by a company that pays generous rebates to its doctors.

But speaking to the New York Times, Melgen's lawyer warned against presuming that the doctor's high Medicare bills meant he was involved in fraud. Instead he insisted that the doctor has a large practice.

But Dr Melgen's lawyer insisted that the physician simply led a large practice.

Melgen has been a key figure in two different federal investigations. His relationship with Senator 
Menendez made headlines last year after news broke that the lawmaker 
used the doctor's personal jet for trips to the Dominican Republic.

In addition to allowing the use 
of his jet, the eye specialist was the top political donor for Menendez 
as the New Jersey Democrat sought re-election to the Senate that year.

Menendez's
 relationship with Melgen prompted Senate Ethics and Justice Department 
investigations, and Menendez reimbursed Melgen more than $70,000 for plane 
trips.

The issue exploded in
 late January 2013, after the FBI conducted a search of Melgen's West 
Palm Beach offices. Melgen said he had done nothing wrong.

AP picked the $3 million threshold because that was the figure used by the Health and Human Services inspector general in an audit last year that recommended Medicare automatically scrutinize total billings above a set level. Medicare says it's working on that recommendation.

About one in four of the top-paid doctors - 87 of them - practice in Florida, a state known both for high Medicare spending and widespread fraud. Rounding out the top five states were California with 38 doctors in the top group, New Jersey with 27, Texas with 23, and New York with 18.

In the $3 million-plus club, 151 ophthalmologists - eye specialists - accounted for nearly $658 million in Medicare payments, leading other disciplines.

Cancer doctors rounded out the top four specialty groups, accounting for a combined total of more than $477 million in payments.

Overall, Medicare paid individual physicians nearly $64 billion in 2012.

The median payment- the point at which half the amounts are higher and half are lower - was $30,265, a tiny fraction of what its top paid received.

AP's analysis focused on individual physicians, excluding about 55,000 organizations that also appear in the database, such as ambulance services. None of those entities was paid $3 million or more.

The Medicare claims database is considered the richest trove of information on doctors, surpassing what major insurance companies have in their files.

Although Medicare is financed by taxpayers, the data have been off limits to the public for decades. Physician organizations went to court to block its release, arguing it would amount to an invasion of doctors' privacy.

Employers, insurers, consumer groups and media organizations pressed for release. Together with other sources of information, they argued that the data could help guide patients to doctors who provide quality, cost-effective care.

A federal judge last year lifted the main legal obstacle to release, and the Obama administration recently informed the American Medical Association it would open up the claims data.

'It will allow us to start putting the
 pieces together,' said Dianne Munevar, a top researcher at the health 
care data firm Avalare Health. 'That is the basis of what payment 
delivery reform is about.'

Doctors'
 decision-making patterns are of intense interest to researchers who 
study what drives the nation's $2.8-trillion-a-year health care system. 
Within the system, physicians act as the main representatives of 
patients, and their decisions about how to treat determine spending.

The
 American Medical Association, which has long opposed release of the 
Medicare database, is warning it will do more harm than good.

The
 AMA says the files may contain inaccurate information. And even if the 
payment amounts are correct, the AMA says they do not provide meaningful
 insights into the quality of care.

'We believe that the broad data dump ... has significant shortcomings regarding the accuracy and value of the medical services rendered by physicians,' AMA president Ardis Dee Hoven said.

'Releasing the data without context will likely lead to inaccuracies, misinterpretations, false conclusions and other unintended consequences.'

The AMA had asked the government to allow individual doctors to review their information prior to its release.

Over time, as researchers learn to mine the Medicare data, it could change the way medicine is practiced in the U.S. Doctor ratings, often based on the opinions of other physicians, would be driven by hard data, like statistics on baseball players. Consumers could become better educated about the doctors in their communities.

For example, if your father is about to undergo heart bypass, you could find out how many operations his surgeon has done in the last year.  Research shows that for many procedures, patients are better off going to a surgeon who performs them frequently.

The data could also be used to spot fraud, such as doctors billing for seeing more patients in a day than their office could reasonably be expected to care for.

Medical practice would have to change to accommodate big data. Acting as intermediaries for employers and government programs, insurers could use the Medicare numbers to demand that low-performing doctors measure up. If the data indicated a particular doctor's diabetic patients were having unusually high rates of complications, that doctor might face questions.

Such oversight would probably accelerate trends toward large medical groups and doctors working as employees instead of in small practices.
