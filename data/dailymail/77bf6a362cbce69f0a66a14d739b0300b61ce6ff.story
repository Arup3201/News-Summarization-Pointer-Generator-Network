Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said a quarter of Premier League players were black — but not a single manager

Premiership football clubs should be forced to interview at least one black candidate every time they appoint a new manager, a Labour MP has said.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said a quarter of Premier League players were black — but not a single manager. Across English football's four professional divisions there are just two black managers.

Mr Umunna said it was time to introduce the 'Rooney rule' – first introduced in American Football in 2003 to boost the number of black and ethnic minority coaches.

The principle was introduced by Dan Rooney – not Wayne, the Manchester United player – an NFL club owner who introduced a rule where at least one non-white candidate must be interviewed when a manager's job comes up.

Mr Umunna said: 'It's made a real difference in American football. Voices from both inside and outside the game, including PFA Chief Gordon Taylor, have said there is a strong case for examining this proposal and whether it can be introduced in English football.

'Personally, I have a lot of sympathy for this and would think it deserves consideration.'

Mr Umunna made the remarks in a speech in Brixton to mark Black History Week.

The Streatham MP said: 'We can't carry on like this — this has to change. Can we really say to our young people that we rate their physical ability more than their other talents?'

He also called for more action to boost the number of black and Asian people in university management and company boardrooms, suggesting there should be compulsory reporting by firms on their diversity, just as they have to reveal how many women get directorships.

Mr Umunna's father was on the board at Crystal Palace and was the only African director of any Premier League club when the league was launched in 1992.

But he said: 'Things haven't changed much in 22 years. Look at Premier League clubs now and you'll see most have no people of colour on their boards or in any senior roles.

'Out of 92 professional league clubs, there are currently only two black managers.'

Sport was often held up as 'an arena in which barriers have been broken' but the MP said: 'We rightly cheer the success of our many black footballers ... But take a look off the pitch, where a lot of power is wielded, and you see a different story.'

Television and newspapers also failed to reflect their audience, he said, pointing out that Amol Rajan, the editor of the Independent, is currently the only BME journalist to run a newspaper.

'How can you present an accurate portrait and reflect the experience of people of colour in our country, if those very people do not sit at your top table?' he asked.

Carlisle United's Keith Curle and Huddersfield Town's Chris Powell are the only two black managers throughout the 92 professional clubs in the Premier and Football Leagues.

Huddersfield are in the Championship and Carlisle in League Two, the fourth tier of English football.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was asked last week whether the Rooney Rule should be ntroduced to the Premier League but the Portuguese denied more needed to be done, saying: 'There is no racism in football. Football is not so stupid to close doors to people.'
