A woman's funeral was postponed because her heartbroken and 'utterly devoted' husband was found hanging just a day before the service.

Father-of-two Michael Hopper, 68, was discovered by police at his £400,000 home in Warminster, Wiltshire, on November 27.

His wife, 65-year-old chemist dispenser Christine, had passed away there 11 days before he was found.

Yesterday Warminster Rector, the Reverend Dennis Brett, said: 'I was going to conduct her service on November 28.

Christine Hopper's funeral service was due to be held at West Wiltshire Crematorium (pictured) last month

'Her funeral was postponed so there can be a joint service on December 16. It is tragic.' 

It is understood people had turned up to mourn her death at West Wiltshire Crematorium.

June Perkins, a former neighbour of the couple, said: 'They were so utterly devoted to each other. They were so very close. It is so very sad.

'He would not know what to do with himself after he lost her.'

Mr Hopper, a retired teacher, was found by the same police officer on November 27 who went to the house when his wife died on November 16.

Yesterday Wiltshire Police stressed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr Hopper's death.

Police also confirmed they went to the house 11 days earlier after a call from the Ambulance Service regarding Mrs Hopper's death.

'But there were no suspicious circumstances over her death.'

West Wiltshire Crematorium confirmed the double funeral would be held on 16 December.

An inquest at Salisbury, Wiltshire, was told that Michael George Jeffery Hopper was found hanging by a police officer at his home in mid evening on 27 November.

Toxicology tests were ordered.

He was confirmed dead at the scene and it is not known how long he had been hanging.

He was identified by the police officer who knew him from the earlier visit.

The inquest was adjourned to a date to be fixed.

Later the Coroner's office said: 'There will be no inquest into Mrs Hopper's death because she died from natural causes.'
