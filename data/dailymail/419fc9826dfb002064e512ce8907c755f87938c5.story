Plus size women are angry that Old Navy charges more for larger clothing, but one ESPN host has said they should focus their energy 'on a treadmill' instead.

Colin Cowherd, who hosts daily radio show The Heard, was addressing a recent campaign started by New York-based merchandiser Renee Posey to persuade the brand to scrap its controversial size-based pricing policy.

After Thursday's show, men and women took to Twitter to voice their disbelief, with one critic calling for his suspension. 

Sparking controversy: ESPN Radio host Colin Cowherd said that plus-size women protesting Old Navy's pricing policy should focus their anger 'on a treadmill' instead

Twitter user EliIsELITE remarked: 'Cowherd on those plus-size women complaining about Old Navy: "Maybe these woman should focus their anger and energy on a treadmill instead."'

Sports writer/consultant Jesse Peel tweeted: 'So how long will Colin's suspension be after saying plus sized women should "Get on a treadmill"?' 

Real estate professional Mary Ann Maiorana also had sharp words for the outspoken host: 'Most ridiculous argument ever for charging women more for plus sized clothing. Surprised at you Colin #sexist. ' 

Ohio resident Andy Huffman tweeted: 'I really hope the feminists get a hold of what Colin Cowherd is saying right now. I'd love for him to be off the air.'  

The smaller the size, the smaller the price: Old Navy's popular Rockstar Super Skinny Jeans are $34.94 if bought in sizes 0 to 20

Mr Cowherd, who has two children from a previous marriage, including a ten-year-old daughter, is known for his outspoken views on the ESPN show, which he's hosted for more than a decade.

Earlier this week, Old Navy tried to claim that 'unique fabrics and design elements' were to blame for the controversial size-based pricing policy, which has left women particularly frustrated given that menswear items remain the same price regardless of size.

According to Ms Posey, who is calling for the brand to scrap its 'discriminatory' plus-size up-charges, the discrepancy between the prices for larger men and women is nothing other than 'straight up fat shaming'.

'Plus size women like myself are kind of fed up with being treated like second-class citizens by retailers,' the 34-year-old told Today.com. 'I think it's reached critical mass and people are ready for a change.'

Unfair increase: Any women who buy a pair of the Rockstar Super Skinny Jeans in a plus size fit will be charged an additional $10, bringing the total price up to $44.94

After Ms Posey started a petition on Change.org, calling for the brand to change their gender-biased price policies, a spokeswoman for Gap Inc, Old Navy's parent company, released a statement blaming the increased costs for plus-size womenswear on the fact that the larger designs require additional details not found in the smaller sizes

'For women, styles are not just larger sizes of other women’s items, they are created by a team of designers who are experts in creating the most flattering and on-trend plus styles, which includes curve-enhancing and curve-flattering elements such as four-way stretch materials and contoured waistbands, which most men's garments do not include,' spokeswoman Debbie Felix explained. 

'This higher price point reflects the selection of unique fabrics and design elements.'

But Ms Posey insists that the statement does not address why there is not a single increase for any of the larger menswear designs, particularly as they also require the use of additional materials.  

'Every woman knows how hard it is to find a good pair of jeans: a pair that is the right fit at the right price,' she wrote on the petition. 'That’s why I was shocked when, during a recent visit to Old Navy’s website, I noticed that they were charging $12-$15 more for plus-sized women's jeans - but not up-charging jeans for “big” men. 

'If they are charging plus-sized women more to cover the cost of the fabric being used, then why aren’t they doing the same for men?

Fighting for change: Ms Posey's petition has been signed by more than 33,000 people

'I was fine paying the extra money as a plus-sized woman, because, you know, more fabric equals higher cost of manufacture. However, selling jeans to larger-sized men at the same cost as they sell to smaller men not only negates the cost of manufacture argument, but indicates that Old Navy is participating in both sexism and sizeism, directed only at women.'

And it seems that Ms Posey is not alone in her opinion; thus far her petition has gained the support of more than 33,000 people, with many agreeing that Old Navy's 'unfair' prices should be scrapped once and for all.

'I wear a plus size, and have noticed that other stores these sizes may be a bit higher in price, but not to the extent that old navy charges,' supporter Dorei Sparrowhawk commented on the petition.

Plus size discrimination: Old Navy offers a variety of plus size designs but 

'And in other stores, men are also charged higher for plus sizes. Why does old navy penalizes us because we are women? This discrimination needs to stop.' 

While many brands charge more for their plus size collections, blaming the additional fabric for the increased costs, the majority implement the same - or similar - price adjustments for both men and women. 

'When you’re talking about needing more yardage, it’s going to be more expensive - but that’s true for men as well,' Christine Hunsicker, chief executive of Gwynnie Bee, a monthly subscription service for plus-size clothing told Today.com. 'It doesn’t actually make sense to me why men’s is not priced differently.'
