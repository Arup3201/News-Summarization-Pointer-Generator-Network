Five people were killed and more than 80 injured when a series of blasts rocked Patna on Sunday, shortly before the BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was to address his party's much-awaited Hunkar rally.

The first explosion occurred around 9.30am inside a washroom on platform no. 10 towards the Karbigahiya end of Patna Junction.

This was followed by six more blasts in succession, both in and outside the Gandhi Maidan, the rally's venue.

Blasts: Smoke rises after a bomb exploded at the boundary of Gandhi Maidan

Emergency: Many of the injured were treated at Patna Medical College and Hospital

Address: The BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi appealed for calm after the blasts calling the attack 'saddening and unfortunate'

Bihar's Director General of Police 
Abhayanand said that altogether five persons were killed and 83 others 
injured in the seven blasts, apparently triggered by low-intensity 
improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

The police also recovered four live bombs, which were defused later. One of those killed is yet to be identified.

Timing

The first of the six blasts near the Gandhi Maidan took place near Udyog Bhawan at 11.40am, followed by another explosion 25 minutes later near Regent Cinema outside the boundary of the rally venue.

Response: An injured man is taken to hospital by a policeman after the blast

Two more blasts occurred in quick succession near the old Gandhi statue and Twin tower within the ground at 12.10pm and 12.15pm respectively. The last two bombs exploded outside the ground near SBI main office and the children's park at 12.20pm and 12.45pm.

There was, however, no blast after Modi rose to speak around 1.30pm.

The explosions created panic at the ground and tens of thousands of people gathered there started running for safety.

The DGP said a team of the National Investigation Agency had reached Patna to investigate the matter.

He also claimed the state police had followed the mandatory security procedure before the rally.

"The
police have also arrested a suspect who is believed to have been 
injured while planting the bomb [at the railway station]," he said.

Bihar
chief minister Nitish Kumar said the timing and day chosen for the 
explosions indicated a deliberate plot to vitiate the atmosphere.

However, he denied that there was any lapse on part of the state police.

"There
was no security input about the blasts either from the central agencies
or the state agencies," he said.

Nitish also refused to speculate over who
was behind the attack.

"It will be too early to come to any conclusion. Let the investigating agencies probe the matter first."

The chief minister, who announced an 
ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each for the families of those killed, said he 
had cancelled his scheduled visit to Munger and Rajgir in the wake of 
the tragedy.

He said the 
injured people were being treated at various hospitals. Denying the 
possibility of a political conspiracy, Nitish said the motive of the 
explosions was obviously to create disturbance in the country.

He said Bihar did not have a history of such incidents during political rallies.

"This incident is a blot on the state record in this regard. The conspiracy behind the blasts will be revealed soon," he said.

"Regardless of the political differences, we need to stay united to foil the designs of divisive forces," he added.

Conspirators behind the serial explosions appear to have hoodwinked the Bihar Police by planting a bomb at the railway station ahead of Gujarat CM Narendra Modi's rally at Gandhi Maidan on Sunday.

The bomb planted inside a station toilet exploded around 9.30am, more than two hours before the next bomb went off at the rally venue.

Five more blasts occurred in an hour on the premises of Gandhi Maidan. Investigators are probing if the bomb was kept at the railway station to divert the attention of top Bihar Police officers who were busy monitoring security arrangements for the BJP rally.

Senior police officers had reached Patna Junction with experts from the forensic science laboratory, a bomb disposal squad and sniffer dogs soon after the first blast at the rally venue was reported.

There are apprehensions among police officers that the terror suspects, who are believed to have carried out the operation, might have sneaked into Gandhi Maidan and mingled with the crowd when senior police officers were busy monitoring the situation at Patna Junction.

Patna SSP Manu Maharaj, meanwhile, said the arrested person had confessed to his involvement in the blasts.

Preliminary investigation hinted that the attacks might have been carried by Indian Mujahideen. The police said the arrested person is a relative of a top IM operative who has been absconding.

The Union home ministry swung into action soon after serial bomb explosions rocked Patna on Sunday and dispatched teams of the National Security Guards (NSG) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to Bihar.

Minister of State for Home RPN Singh said the NIA and NSG teams have been rushed to Patna to probe the blast sequence.

Initial reports indicated that the explosions were caused by low-intensity devices. The Centre assured full cooperation to the Nitish Kumar government.

"We are in constant touch with the authorities, who are updating us on the situation," Singh said.

The minister also claimed that there was no specific intelligence input about the blasts in Patna.

The ministry cautioned against politicisation of the blasts and Singh appealed to political parties to refrain from inciting people, as the blasts took place before BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally in the state.

The Centre has also sought a report from the Bihar government on the explosions.
