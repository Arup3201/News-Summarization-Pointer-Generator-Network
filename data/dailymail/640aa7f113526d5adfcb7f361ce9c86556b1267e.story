A mother has slammed discount supermarket Aldi after claiming she found a TOENAIL in her pasta sauce.

Tracy Arnold, 46, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, made the grim discovery after cooking spaghetti bolognese for herself and her daughter.

Horrified: Tracy Arnold, 46, found the man's toe nail in a jar of tomato sauce she bought to make her dinner

Disgusting: Tracy said she initially thought the toenail was a piece of gristle sticking out of her dinner

The pair were about to begin their meal when Tracy's 22-year-old daughter screamed at the sight of the huge toenail sticking out of the family dinner.

Mrs Arnold said she was completely shocked by the 'disgusting' discovery, which she had initially thought was a piece of gristle.

She quickly realised the foul object was a toenail that had either came from the pasta sauce or from a packet of minced beef she had bought from an Aldi store that morning.

She said: 'It was the most disgusting thing I have ever found in food in my life.

It was huge, it looked like it had been cut.'

Huge: The man's toenail that Tracy found in her food was more than 1cm long

The next day she took the toenail back to the supermarket in Wisbech where staff were shocked by her discovery.

But Mrs Arnold is still fuming because she says when she took up the issue with the Aldi head office they showed little care.

She is calling for all products to be recalled until a full investigation is carried out and wants to be refunded the £127 she spent on her weekly shop.

A spokeswoman for Aldi said: 'We work hard to provide high quality products for our shoppers and take customer complaints very seriously.

'We have requested that Mrs Arnold returns the product to store so that we can investigate the matter further with our suppliers.'
