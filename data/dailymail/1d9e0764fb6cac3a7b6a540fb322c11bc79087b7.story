Parade: A picture of a bus embossed with the Arsenal badge and strap-line 'FA Cup Winners' has emerged

The leaked picture comes after it was 
revealed earlier in the week, that the Gunners, without silverware for 
nine seasons, have seemingly pre-empted victory against Hull be planning
 an open-top bus parade.

Traffic notices have been served in Islington, north London, with Arsene Wenger's side set to parade the FA Cup 24 hours after Saturday's final.

Arsenal made similar plans in 2006 before their Champions League final against Barcelona in Paris.

Wenger's men were beaten 2-1 and the parade was duly scrapped.

Scrapped: Arsenal made plans for an open-top bus tour ahead of their Champions League defeat in 2006

The club's last bus celebration came in 2004 following 'The Invincibles' unbeaten Premier League season. They did not parade in the wake of their 2005 FA Cup victory over Manchester United; that was the last time the club won a trophy.

This weekend's planned parade would start at 11am at the Emirates Stadium before going through Drayton Park, Aubert Park, Highbury Park, Highbury Grove, St Paul's Road and into Upper Street and a reception at Islington Assembly Hall.The parade would conclude with a team appearance on the Emirates podium.
