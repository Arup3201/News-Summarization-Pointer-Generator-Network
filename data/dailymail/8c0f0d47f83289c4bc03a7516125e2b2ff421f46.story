We've had a whole book’s worth of party tips. We know all about her Friday night suppers. She’s even told us about her father’s Christmas costumes (one year, a sumo outfit).

As if that wasn’t enough information, now socialite-turned-columnist Pippa Middleton has regaled us with tales of her schoolgirl crush on her hockey coach – and how her ‘derriere’ helped her out on the netball pitch.

Alas, the ‘undeniably fanciable’ object of her affections may be less than delighted to find himself the subject of her latest column, ‘Confessions of a sporty schoolgirl’ – he has just started a new job as the head of a prestigious school.

Crush: Pippa Middleton, pictured in London earlier this week, has described her old PE teacher as 'undeniably fanciable'

Miss Middleton, 29, wrote the article for this week’s Spectator. She 
describes how she was the proud captain of the hockey team at 
Marlborough College in Wiltshire, which her sister Kate, now the Duchess
of Cambridge, also attended.

She writes: ‘When I close my eyes and think about school sports, I 
envisage myself on the hockey pitch, stick in hand, a luminous gumshield
locked on to my chops and a bandana across my forehead. (Bandanas were 
all the rage back then).

Pippa's old PE teacher Mr Markham

‘Boys are watching. I can also hear the booming voice of Mr Markham, our fierce but undeniably fanciable coach, urging us all on.’

She adds later: ‘Did I mention the boys watching?’ Last night the Daily Mail tracked down the object of her teenage crush, Richard Markham, 41, himself a one-time Welsh international hockey star.

He has just started a new job as head of a top private school in Hertfordshire, where his efforts to establish himself with his pupils are unlikely to be aided by Miss Middleton’s happy memories.

Twelve years older than Miss Middleton, he would have been in his early twenties and newly on the staff of Marlborough when she became a pupil.

Mr Markham, from Southampton, read history at Oxford University and represented Wales at hockey at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. He married his university sweetheart Kate Farquahar, the same year.

A physics graduate, she now works as a high-flying executive at a City insurance firm.

Last night Mr Markham was reluctant to discuss his former pupil. But his 71-year-old father, David, laughed when he heard about Miss Middleton’s description.

He said: ‘I think he will be abashed by the description. He is quite reserved. But Kate [his wife] will think it is quite funny.’

He added: ‘I would not say he was “fierce” but he does have what I would call a traditional school teacher look – he can look at you in a way that gets your attention.’

He said Mr Markham’s mother, Jennifer, who died a few years ago, would have agreed with the description. ‘She was a schoolteacher and she had that same look as well,’ he said.

New role: Mr Markham is now principal at the Hockerill Anglo-European College in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire

Mr Markham taught at Marlborough until earlier this year, rising to the post of director of studies.

He taught both history and history of art, and was the school’s master in charge of hockey.

He is now principal of Hockerill Anglo-European College in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, which charges up to £14,379 a year for boarders. He lives with his wife and their two children in a large detached house that comes with the job.

Last night he said: ‘I taught at Marlborough for 20 years and we categorically never comment on pupils or former pupils.’ But despite her fondness for Mr Markham, he was not the man Pippa was most worried about.

She recalls: ‘The other Mr M in my life (father and also coach) is on the sidelines, and I’m desperate to impress him most of all.’

Elsewhere in the column she reveals she also played netball, which she describes as ‘like basketball with all the fun bits taken out’.

But she said the shoulder-barging, though brutal, ‘turns out to have been very useful practice for handling the media in later life’.

Cheered on: Pippa, pictured (right) at Wimbledon with her parents, says that the man she most wanted to impress with her hockey skills however, was the 'other Mr M in her life' - her father Michael (centre)

She wrote: ‘You spend most of the time playing a complex version of piggy-in-the-middle, except the piggies are a pack of vicious girls. My petite physique enabled me to nip and tuck my way past the bigger-chested girls.

‘Elbows always helped; as did the derriere for defence (my “chest” hadn’t developed back then) and  a bit of shoulder-barging here  or there.’

She said her ‘piano legs’ helped her do well at cross country, adding: ‘We Middleton girls were always  at the starting line – albeit reluctantly – fuelled by Lucozade tablets and bananas.

‘Rain was inevitable and we’d get caked in mud from head to toe, in our tiny athletic shorts, white Aertex and all.’

She said the worst horror of all was the swimming gala, and in particular the changing rooms where ‘everyone had to walk around sheepishly in tight Speedo bathing suits’.

Miss Middleton was asked to write the article for the Spectator’s supplement on independent schools, on sale from today. She also writes a food column in Waitrose Kitchen magazine and is a contributing editor to Vanity Fair magazine.

In a previous Spectator column, she told readers that her father, Michael, liked wearing fancy dress at Christmas.

She wrote: ‘[He] typically gets a bit carried away – a couple of Christmases ago, he appeared in an inflatable sumo outfit.’
