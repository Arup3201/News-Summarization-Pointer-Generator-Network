The man arrested on suspicion of murdering a mother-of-two and her baby son was a new boyfriend she described as 'everything I want in a man' just weeks before her death, friends claimed today.

Yvonne Walsh, 25, and seven-month-old Harry, were found dead at their home in Birmingham on Sunday.

Friends of care home manager Yvonne said she had just started seeing the 28-year-old man now arrested on suspicion of the pair's murder less than two months ago.

Their relationship started after she split from Harry's father, Ryan Wotton, it was claimed.

Smitten Yvonne texted a friend on April 12 this year describing her new man as 'amazing'.

She wrote: 'Found someone much 
better...he is amazing everything that I want and need in a man lol 
sounds so soppy if you know me lol x'.

After news of the arrest broke friends assumed Ryan was the man in custody but later realised their mistake.

The friend wrote: 'Got to apologise it seems it wasn't the father of Yvonne's baby it was her new BF.'

It also emerged Yvonne worked at a care home for vulnerable adults in Moseley, Birmingham.

She had been manager at the Oak View 
branch of Aspects Care Ltd., which sits just a mile-and-a-half from her 
home in Chells Grove, Billesley, for three years.

Speaking at the home, which provides 
accommodation for adults with learning difficulties and mental health 
problems, director Paul Graham said: 'I can confirm that she worked 
here.

'She was a manager. She worked for us 
for three years and had been with the company that owned it before for 
three years so has been here six years.

'She was an extremely good manager and potentially had a very good career ahead of her.

'She was very dedicated to what she did and very diligent in her work.

'People are in shock because you never expect it to happen on your own doorstep.

'Staff are upset but we have a service to provide so work continues as normal.

'The police are here but I can categorically deny the suspect was from here.'

Police confirmed they had arrested a 28-year-old man in Sandwell, West Mids., on Sunday afternoon.

He was later sectioned under the Mental Health Act and deemed unfit to be interviewed by officers.

A spokesperson for West Midlands 
Police said: 'A 28-year-old man arrested in the Sandwell area on 
suspicion of both murders is currently in a secure facility following an
assessment by mental health professionals.

'He is currently deemed unfit to be interviewed by officers at this stage, but this is being constantly reviewed.

'Forensic examinations of the house in Chells Grove are ongoing and investigations are ongoing.

'Local officers continue to provide reassurance patrols in the area.

'Anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area late Saturday night or early Sunday morning are urged to call police.'

Forensic teams were still 
investigating the £114,000 terraced property today, where Yvonne lived 
with Harry and daughter Jessica, three.

Neighbours were still coming to terms with the tragedy on their doorsteps.

Builder Mike Partridge, 57, said his sister fostered Yvonne for a short period in her teens.

He said: 'Yvonne was 15 when my sister fostered her, so she was like a part of the family.

'She was a very bright and well-mannered girl.

'A superb mum and a lovely woman. It's not like her to mix with the wrong sort, but I never met her boyfriend.

'I'm distraught about it, that little boy was adorable, and now I'm never going to see him grow into a man.'

Susan Butler, 62, an accounts 
assistant who has lived on the road six years, said: 'I only knew Yvonne
to say hello to, she seemed a very quiet lady.

'Very pretty and always holding the baby.

'I'm just shocked, it's very raw because of how brutally they were killed.

'I don't get how anyone could do that to a poor little baby.'

Grief: A bunch of flowers and a teddy left at the scene in Chells Grove, Billesley, West Midlands - the scene of the horrific double murder of a mother and her young son

Home: The bodies of the 25-year-old woman and her nine-month-old son were discovered by West Midlands Police at a house on Chells Grove (pictured) in the Billesley area of Birmingham at around 10:30am

Due to previous contact with the 
arrested man West Midlands Police informed watchdog the Independent 
Police Complaints Commission who will examine his involvement with 
police.

A serious case review and domestic homicide review are also expected to take place in due course.

Post-mortem examinations are due to take place later today to determine the cause of the victims' deaths.

Meanwhile, forensic inquiries are continuing at the house in Chells Grove, which remains subject to a police cordon.

Last night officers had cordoned off 
the house while investigators examined the scene. The bodies were found 
after neighbours raised concerns about the safety of Miss Walsh and her 
son.

Neighbour Gulfraz Hussain, 30, said: ‘I can’t believe what’s happened. It’s tragic. I’ve had people nick my number plate 
and there’s burglaries but nothing like this has ever happened.’

Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I heard from 
people who had talked to the police that Yvonne and Harry were killed on
Friday and only found by police when someone rang to say they couldn’t 
get through to her on the phone.

‘Her brother arrived at the house 
earlier and was in floods of tears. It is so sad, she was a lovely, warm
person and a great mum, she loved her kids.

'We chatted when I saw her 
taking her kids out and I never had any impression she had any problems 
at home. She just seemed like a normal, happy mum.’

One resident leaving Chells Grove 
today said police had initially informed local people that a serious 
incident had taken place in the street.

The neighbour, who declined to give 
her name, told reporters: 'We saw her (Ms Walsh) around with her little 
baby but she kept herself to herself to be honest.

'It was really surprising when I heard
what had happened because I have not heard or seen anything happening 
at the house before.

'It was yesterday morning we saw the 
police arrive at about 10 o'clock - they told us there had been a 
serious incident and we found out on the news what had happened.'

Another resident, 62-year-old Susan Butler, paid tribute to Ms Walsh and described news of the deaths as truly shocking.

'You just don't envisage something 
happening like that,' she said. 'She was a pretty quiet girl and I saw 
her last week holding the baby.

'It's really, really shocking and all the neighbours are probably feeling the same.'

Superintendent Jo Chilton, from West 
Midlands CID, said: ‘This is a terrible crime and my thoughts are with 
the family of the victims.

‘We have a man in custody and are not 
looking for anyone else, but I am keen to speak to any witnesses or 
anyone who may have seen anything which could assist our investigation.’

Superintendent Andy Shipman, from 
Birmingham South local policing unit, said: ‘The awful murders will send
shockwaves through the community. My thoughts are with the family of 
those involved.

‘Officers will be highly visible in 
the area in the coming week, reassuring local people. I want to reassure
the community that we believe there is no ongoing threat to the 
public.’
