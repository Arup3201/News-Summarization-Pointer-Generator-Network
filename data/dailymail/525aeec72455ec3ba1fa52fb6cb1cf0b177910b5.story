This is the moment the deaf brother of reality TV star Josie Gibson was punched to the ground in an unprovoked nightclub attack.

Harry Mook-Gibson, 27, was left covered in blood with nose and lip injuries after being targeted by Charlie Radnedge in Dojo Lounge Nightclub in Bristol city centre in January last year.

Mr Mook-Gibson, the sibling of the Big Brother star who famously dropped six stone, had been out celebrating his sister's 29th birthday when the assault occurred.

Radnedge, 24, of Bradley Stoke, South Gloucestershire, was jailed for 12 months at Bristol Crown Court this week after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm and breaching a suspended sentence order.

CCTV footage released by Avon and Somerset Police today shows Mr Mook-Gibson lying on the floor in the stairwell of the nightclub (left) after being punched by Radnedge, who walks off and leaves his victim (far right)

Following his sentencing, Avon and Somerset Police released CCTV footage of the attack which shows Radnedge knocking Mr Mook-Gibson to the ground.

The victim can be seen stood in the corridor of the nightclub before a dispute ensues. Radnedge then follows Mr Mook-Gibson as he tries to leave through a stairwell before punching him in the face.

Mr Mook-Gibson, who was wearing a white shirt at the time, ends up falling to the floor covered in blood.

Following the assault in the early hours of January 26 last year, his sister Josie took to Twitter to claim he was targeted for being deaf.

She uploaded a photograph of her injured brother and accompanied it with: 'Lost all faith in mankind tonight. I went to the toilet and my brother got beaten up for being deaf.

'What a disgusting world we live in.

'I'm going to hunt the bullies who did this! The nicest guy ever was beaten up because they thought he was deaf & dumb.'

Radnedge's 12-month sentence included a three-month jail term for ABH and nine months for breaching a suspended sentence order.

Today, investigating officer PC Brett Stinchcombe said: 'Radnedge carried out an unprovoked and vicious assault on the victim in a city centre nightclub.

'In police interview, he tried to claim he was acting in self-defence but the CCTV footage showed a very different story.

'We identified Radnedge after releasing CCTV images as part of a public appeal for help and I'm grateful to everyone who responded to this appeal.

'The victim suffered some serious injuries to his face and the assault marred what should have been an enjoyable night celebrating his sister's birthday.

'We take all forms of violence seriously and will do everything we can to bring those who engage in violent acts to justice.'

Following the attack, Mr Mook-Gibson's sister Josie (pictured) said he was targeted because 'they thought he was deaf and dumb'. She said she was 'disgusted' with the attack which left her brother with facial injuries

After the attack Miss Gibson said her brother had been targeted because they 'thought he was deaf and dumb'

Several famous faces posted online in support, including Chanelle Hayes and Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace

Mr Mook-Gibson became deaf after suffering meningitis as a baby.

The trauma of seeing him on a life-support machine inspired Josie to organise a fundraiser for the charity Meningitis UK in 2012.

After the attack, several of her celebrity friends posted messages online in support.

Reality star and glamour model Chanelle Hayes tweeted her sympathy, saying: 'That is the most disgusting, disgraceful, vile thing I've ever heard of.

'Some people are sick. Sending love to ur brother.'

And media personality and fellow Big Brother contestant Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace added: 'Nooo babe I'm so sorry that's vile... don't let the vile thugs win.'
