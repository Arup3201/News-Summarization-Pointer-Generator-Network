'Spotted': Eppie Sprung Dawson, 26, has been suspended from St Joseph's College Dumfries after she was allegedly caught with the pupil in a layby

A married teacher has been suspended from a Catholic school after she was allegedly caught with a 17-year-old pupil in a layby after a school prom.

Eppie Sprung Dawson, 26, faces prosecution after officers  reportedly surprised her in the car with the boy.

Another pupil is thought to have called police after seeing the blonde teacher pull into the layby with the pupil after they left a school Christmas party on December 22.

Mrs Sprung Dawson, who teaches English at St Joseph’s College in  Dumfries, Scotland, has been married for almost three years to Ranald Dawson, 32, the son of the former Solicitor General for Scotland, Lord Dawson.

Last night, the blinds were closed at the couple’s house in a smart area of Dumfries and there was no sign of Mrs Sprung Dawson.

Her visibly upset husband refused to comment.

A spokesman for Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary said: ‘We can confirm that following the receipt of a complaint, a woman will be the subject of a report to the procurator fiscal.

‘As inquiries are continuing, it would be inappropriate to  comment further.’

It is not known if the 17-year-old sixth-form pupil involved in the police investigation was taught directly by Mrs Sprung Dawson.

A woman at his family home last night said: ‘He is the victim in this but I don’t want to talk about it.’

Prestigious institution: The pair were allegedly spotted together in a car after a school dance at St Joseph's College Dumfries

Wedding day: Eppie Sprung-Dawson with husband Ranald Dawson, 32, also a teacher

A close friend of the teenager’s family 
added: ‘This has just come to light and it is a really emotionally 
traumatic time for the family.’

A source at the comprehensive school 
said: ‘Apparently they were returning from a dance on Saturday when they
decided to pull in at a layby.

Rumours: Police confirmed that they had received a complaint and that the inquiries are ongoing

'The rumour is that another pupil spotted
them and called police.

'Mrs Dawson has always been a popular member of 
staff and is very dedicated to her pupils.’

A former St Joseph’s pupil, who asked 
not to be named, said: ‘I was very shocked when I heard.

Mrs Sprung 
Dawson was a very good teacher and well-respected.

‘It is a Roman Catholic school and is very religious. They still hold Masses in the mornings.’

One former pupil said Mrs Sprung 
Dawson often sent text messages, which ended in kisses, and was known 
for being ‘touchy-feely’.

Another ex-pupil had posted a picture of 
himself with her on Twitter, writing: ‘Me and Eppie (Mrs 
Sprung-Dawson)!!! Sexiest English teacher to ever grace this land, love 
you Eppie xxxx.’

Mrs Sprung Dawson’s parents live in 
Coventry but she moved to Scotland to marry Mr Dawson, a lecturer, keen 
golfer and one of the two sons of Lord Dawson, who died in 2007 from 
kidney failure.

The couple tied the knot in April 2010 at Victoria Halls in Selkirk.

Dumfries and Galloway council last night confirmed that a teacher had been suspended.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
