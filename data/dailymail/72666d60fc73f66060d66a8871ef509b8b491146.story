West Ham took a swipe at Jose Mourinho ahead of their Boxing Day clash with Chelsea, mocking the Chelsea bosses' comments from last season.

After watching his side draw 0-0 at Stamford Bridgelast season, Mourinho described Sam Allardyce's playing style as '19th-century football'.

And although the Chelsea manager has since apologised for the remark, the Hammers could not resist a jibe ahead of Friday's fixture.

The official West Ham Twitter account posted a picture of an old-fashioned horse-drawn coach, with Allardyce holding the reigns.

The image was captioned with the message 'The West Ham United team coach (and horse) has arrived at @chesleasfc for today's game #19thcenturyfootball' 

In the build-up to the game Mourinho admitted that he was unwise to use the 'silly' phrase about West Ham, who have played much better football this season. 

'Last season they were in big trouble,' said Mourinho. 'When you are fighting against relegation, you have to do everything to get points.

'Yes it was a turning point for them because it gave them the confidence they needed and after that they kept in the division. This team is different.

'You see the way they play every game, they are a better team, they have better players and I think also Big Sam is showing now he is not what people sometimes say - a defensive coach, only knows how to play defensively and direct with long balls.

'He is giving a completely different image about himself, which can make the game more difficult for us but at the same time more attractive for everyone.

'He has my respect. Last season I had a couple of words about the fact they started winning time after two minutes of the game, which I don't like.'

Allardyce was under pressure when he went to Stamford Bridge last year, but is in a better position now

Allardyce has defended the decision to line-up defensively last season, but claims his side could be more adventurous this year.

‘He plays like that as well when he needs to,’ Allardyce said of Mourinho. ‘But that day he was frustrated, and trying to deflect attention away. 

'Look, the way we played that day wasn’t very adventurous but I was staring down the barrel of a gun. I had to do what I had to do to save my position.'
