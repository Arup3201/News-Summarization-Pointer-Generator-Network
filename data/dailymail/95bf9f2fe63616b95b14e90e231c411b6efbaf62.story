A Taliban bomb-maker suspected of directing an attack that killed three British soldiers could be freed within weeks if lawyers win their battle to close the ‘British Guantanamo’, it was claimed last night.

Defence sources have told The Mail on Sunday that the terrorist leader is being held at a controversial prison within Camp Bastion.

But after pressure from human rights lawyers, the Taliban explosives expert is likely to be released into the notoriously corrupt Afghan judicial system, with the danger that he will be freed to launch fresh attacks.

Controversial: The British prison at Camp Bastion may be closed following the intervention of British human rights lawyers and the inmates are likely to be transferred to an Afghan jail

Three British troops died and six others were wounded five weeks ago when their Mastiff armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device (IED) planted in the Nahr-e Saraj  district of Helmand province.

The deaths of Corporal William  Savage, 30, Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, brought the number of British service personnel deaths since operations began in 2001 in Afghanistan to 444.

Days after the attack, British Special Forces uncovered a cache of home-made bombs five miles from the blast site. Troops followed up this success by capturing the suspected bomb-maker and four accomplices.

Now, following the intervention of 
British human rights lawyers, the Camp Bastion prison is facing closure 
and the inmates are likely to be transferred to an Afghan jail.

Defence sources are adamant that the country’s legal system remains corrupt and that suspected terrorists could be released by the courts or freed in Taliban raids.

Last night, former Government Defence Minister Sir Gerald Howarth attacked the move, saying it will put British soldiers’ lives at risk.

‘Taliban IED technicians represent a 
very serious threat to British personnel. So we should not connive in 
any measure that results in them being able to continue operations 
against our troops,’ he said.

‘I
 am also sick and tired of human rights being evoked to defend or 
protect those who seek to destroy us and take the lives of members of 
Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. So absolutely no way should he or anyone 
else be transferred  or released before the end of 2014 when British 
troops withdraw from Afghanistan.’

Public
 Interest Lawyers, which is acting for eight of the approximately 80 
inmates at the Camp Bastion prison, told this newspaper that its clients
 are being mistreated by UK guards.

It claims that torture techniques such as sleep and sensory deprivation, blindfolding and a process called ‘harshing’ – when guards stand just inches in front of the inmates and  suddenly scream abuse – are being used to extract information and  confessions.

It is also claimed that some inmates have been held without charge for up to 14 months – apparently in breach of UK and International law. Last night the Ministry of Defence insisted that the inmates are treated humanely and that the jail has been inspected by the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers said: ‘The MoD need to find a lawful solution to a problem of their own making.’

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is expected to write this week to lawyers representing inmates, giving 21 days’ notice of their transfer to an Afghan jail.

A MoD spokesman said: ‘We have been working with the Afghan authorities since November to identify an effective safe route to transfer detainees into the Afghan judicial system for prosecution and we intend to put forward our plans shortly.’
