This is the dramatic moment a motorcycle drag racer escaped serious injury by clinging onto the back of a competitor's bike after he was catapulted off his own.

Thousands of horrified spectators watched the astonishing escape in disbelief after Greek racer Filippos Papafilippou was thrown off his bike while crossing the centre line at a Bedfordshire racetrack at nearly 200mph.

He flew through the air for a split-second, before landing on the wheelie bar of opponent Steve Woollatt, 50, and clinging on until the British racer realised what had happened and pulled over.

This photograph shows the astonishing moment a Greek drag racer landed on the back of his rival's bike after a high-speed accident he was lucky to escape alive

How it began: Greek drag racer Filippos Papafilippou is on the left and his British opponent, Steve Woollatt, 50, is on the right at Bedfordshire's Santa Pod racetrack

Crossing the centre line: Papafilippou, left, accelerated over the yellow line, which he later blamed on his bike 'responding violently' when he turned up the throttle

Neck and neck: Just after he crosses the line, Papafilippou's bike is parallel to Woollatt's, but the Greek racer will soon be catapulted off his bike and into the air

As these dramatic pictures show, the incident which happened on Monday at the Santa Pod Raceway outside Wellingborough could have had a far more serious outcome.

Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Papafilippou, 42, who has raced for 14 years, spoke of the incredible event.

He said: 'This is the only dangerous crash I've ever had. I'm lucky, it could have been a lot worse. 

'I felt (the wheel) spinning and when it found traction it reacted violently. I crossed the middle lane and went into his lane. 

'In this sport you don't have time, you have one-thousandths of a second - it's instinct and reaction. I grabbed into him and he's very experienced and didn't panic. 

'It was so lucky I grabbed the wheels, I couldn't go anywhere else. We were laughing nervously afterwards.

'I spoke to people from all over the world and it's never happened before. It's unique.

 'No one has ever started on one bike and finished on the other.'

Ouch: Mr Papafilippou, 42, posted a picture of his injury, which he admits could have been far worse

The riders chewed-up boot. It got caught between the wheel and the wheel arch of his opponent's bike

By yesterday, the Greek racer had recovered sufficiently to post footage of his lucky escape on his Facebook page.

When asked by one British fan: 'Any idea what caused  you to make that hard left?', Papafilippou replied in English: 'We stepped up and put more power to run quicker and the bike responded violently. 

'The bike was pulling a lot harder than in our previous runs and tried to roll over me and I didn't want to go off the throttle.....When I did, it was too late.'

As the footage of the near miss shows, he clung on until the British racer came to a stop further down the track.

After the episode, fans of the Greek racer took to Facebook to wish him luck for the future, with one saying 'Bravo and good luck'.
