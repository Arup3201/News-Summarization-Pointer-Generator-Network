Google has unveiled a new tablet set to seriously challenge Apple’s iPad mini.

The new Nexus 7 is built by Asus and has a seven-inch, 1980x1200 display - the world's highest resolution screen - that offers almost double the pixels per inch than the iPad mini despite being around £100 cheaper.

It also has a 5MP rear-facing camera for the first time, and a faster 1.5Ghz processor compared to the first-generation Nexus 7 device.

The new Nexus 7 is the first gadget 
to be shipped on an updated version of Google's Jelly Bean operating 
system, Android 4.3, and will come in three models: 16GB Wi-Fi for £199 and 32GB Wi-Fi for £229.

A new Nexus 7 32GB with Wi-Fi and LTE will also be available in the coming weeks for £299.

A 64GB LTE model will also be available in the U.S for $349.

All three devices will go on sale in the U.S from 30 July and across Europe in 'the coming weeks.'

‘By 2013 consumers are going to buy more tablets than personal computers every year - that’s pretty amazing,’ said Google's Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai at the launch in San Francisco.

‘At the end of 2012 we were approaching 10m tablets - we are now at over 70m, almost one in two tablets sold worldwide is based on Android.’

It has been a year since Google 
launched its bargain tablet built by Asus, which was praised for its 
high-quality specifications and its low price of £159.

Other 7-inch tablets including the iPad mini cost around the £250 mark.

‘The Nexus 7 was a big hit, and we’re trying to follow up with another one,’ added Google’s Hugo Barra.

‘We are staying focused on the same things, affordability and performance.

The new Nexus 7 is 2mm thinner than the original's 10.5mm design.

The
7-inch screen, which gives the tablet its name, has remained but 
the resolution has been increased to 1980x1200 with 1080p quality.

It is the first device to be shipped on Google's updated Jelly Bean operating system, Android 4.3.

The new Nexus 7 additionally has dual stereo speakers with Fraunhofer virtual surround sound.

Elsewhere, Google has improved the battery life on the new Nexus 7.

‘Even with more than twice the pixels and double the performance, you get an extra hour - up to nine hours of video, and ten hours of web surfing,’ said Barra.

The Nexus 7 will also be the first device to ship with Android 4.3, which has a new ‘child’ mode that can stop children running up huge bills.

The device is 2mm thinner and 30% wider than the old Nexus 7. The display is the 'highest resolution of any tablet on the market' at 1980x1200. Videos can be watched in native 1080p resolution and the new Nexus 7 has front and rear cameras

‘We’re adding multi user so that parents can restrict their child’s access to content and in app purchases,' said Barra.

‘You can hide all of the purchasing functions with restricted profiles.’

The first Google Nexus 7 tablet by Asus was launched in June 2012. It was praised for its high-quality specifications and low price

Children using the device can set up their own homescreens, and only see apps and content their parent's approve.

Google has also partnered with Netflix to offer high resolution downloads and launched a new games app to try and entice iPad users.

'The games category is on fire, we have a new Google Play Games app, said Google Play’s Ellie Powers.

'The Nexus 7 is the perfect gaming device, with its high-resolution display and stereo speakers.'

Rumours about an updated model 
surfaced last month when a customer service representative from Asus - 
the company that makes the tablets for Google - apparently leaked the 
full specifications.

Android Central posted a video and pictures of what it expected the next Nexus model to look like.

Google was criticised following the launch of its first Nexus 7 for not including a rear-facing camera.

At
the time a spokesman was quoted as saying the company left the feature 
off because Google didn't want to encourage people to use the device as a
camera because it was too big.

Analysts
think that Google and Asus might have excluded the feature to keep 
costs down, but following customer complaints, decided to introduce it 
to the new Nexus 7.

Google also unveiled a new gadget that plugs into a TV and allows people to play back videos using their phone, tablet or computer as a remote control.

Called Chromecast, it can stream videos from YouTube, and plugs into a HDMI socket found on all TVs.

Once it's plugged in, you simply go to your YouTube app and press a button in the app to watch the video on a TV.

The firm said both Android and iOS devices will be able to control Chromecast.

Chromecasts costs $35.

Commenting on the news, Jonathan Leggett, mobile expert at uSwitch.com said:

'Like the original, the new Nexus 7 is a generously equipped tablet for such a good price. With an entry-level asking price of just £150 it’s neatly positioned to take a bite out of Apple’s tablet domination.

'Fortunately, the value price tag hasn’t led to a compromise in features. The new model has a more powerful processor and an improved resolution which is considerably better quality than its mini-tablet rival - the iPad mini.

'However, the new Nexus 7’s Achilles heel - as with all Android tablets - is the quality of the apps available compared to the iPad mini and other Apple tablets.

'The relatively slim volume of Android apps optimised for tablets is also a problem, meaning that even if they work, they often have limited functionality.'
