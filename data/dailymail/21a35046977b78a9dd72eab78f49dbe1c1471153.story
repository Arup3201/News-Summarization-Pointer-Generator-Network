When Nelson Mandela chose to make a symbolic trip to Brixton, an area often seen as the centre of Britain's struggle for black rights, in a detour from his state visit in 1996, he was mobbed.

Thousands of people turned out to catch a glimpse of the man who did more than anyone else to bring freedom to South Africa appearing in South London.

He was hailed a 'saint', a 'hero', an 'idol", a 'godhead', someone who is 'bigger than Michael Jackson'.

'Nelson Mandela we love you': A man holds a colourful homemade banner as crowds in Brixton wait to catch a glimpse of anti-Apartheid hero Nelson Mandela on his visit to the South London district in 1996

Brixton's first black mayor, Lloyd 
Leon, 75, told MailOnline: 'I didn't sleep last night because I couldn't
stop thinking about it.

'When Mandela came to Brixton it was like he was coming home. We welcomed him like a brother.

'To see him in person was special, it made me so emotional. Here was an icon of struggle, a man who made freedom happen.

'At that time Brixton was the centre 
for black people in Britain. I can't express what it meant to me 
personally and all the people I knew.

'As I remember he did a tour of Brixton police station, the Brixton Rec and met people and it was wonderful.'

Lambeth's
current mayor, Councillor Mark Bennett, said the town hall will be 
flying the South African flag, along with the Union Flag, at half mast 
in honour of Mr Mandela.

He told MailOnline: 'It was a great moment for Brixton and Lambeth and something many people here had a personal connection to.

'There
are still many people speak fondly of shaking his hand or even being in
the crowd when Mandela visited and that was an important moment for 
many of them, some of whom were themselves victims of intolerance and 
injustice in Britain.

'Nelson Mandela symbolised something we can all aspire to.

'I
met him at the Labour Party conference in 2000, shook his hand and had a
couple of minutes with him which were some of the most important of my 
life.

'Mandela taught forgiveness and tolerance - a message that was especially important in Brixton.'

Carnival atmosphere: The ANC leader waves to crowds as he arrives at the Brixton Recreation Centre

Market trader Stuart Horwood watched the procession from his stall on Pope's Road.

He told the Brixton Blog: 'I was here, right on my pitch on the day that Nelson Mandela 
came to Brixton Recreation Centre. I remember the thousands and 
thousands of people that were here to see him, I remember the carnival 
atmosphere that we had and just the sense of one love.

'Brixton
chooses people and I think Brixton actually chose Nelson Mandela to 
come here, so I think it was a match made in heaven myself. For 
Brixton’s history it’s a major event – I can’t really think of anything 
that’s been more significant as far as positive things go.

'The
sense of respect for the man who’s a great icon – we can only be 
thankful that he came to Brixton. I hope that he’s at peace.'

Brixton
resident Tim Donaghy told the Brixton Blog: 'I was up bright and early so I made sure I 
got a front row place because I didn’t get a ticket to get in the Rec.

'I
was outside the Jacaranda as it was then – now it’s that Craft Beer 
place. It was really good, I got really close to Mandela and Prince 
Charles. Someone put a girl over the railings with flowers to give to 
Nelson Mandela and the security got in a flap and put Mandela and 
Charles in a car to whiz them off to Trafalgar Square where he was 
giving a speech at South Africa House.

Mandela shares a moment with Prince Charles inside the recreation centre: Those unable to get tickets to see him inside lined the route his car took as it went through Brixton on its way there and back

'Everyone
chased the car. There were shoes everywhere on Brixton Rd because 
everyone lost them when they were running. Everyone followed the car up 
to Trafalgar Square.'

'We 
were so proud he was coming to Brixton – he’s the greatest man of our 
lifetime. He came to Brixton for a personal thank you. Through that time
[apartheid era] no one would buy anything South African and everyone 
was going on all the marches.'

Sian Williams recalled: 'We stood on a market stall to get a good view (see below). We still have the T-Shirt.

Aubrey Nunes told the Brixton Blog: 
'That day when Nelson Mandela came to Brixton was the most important day
in the history of Brixton. I was an agent between the anti-racist and 
the anti-apartheid movement in London.

'I
took my kids off school that day, which I’d never done before. It was 
truly special. Whoever played the national anthem only played the first 
half – it was a terrible mistake.

'I
feel very proud that Brixton was singled out, it was such an honour. 
The most famous politician in the world comes to London and chooses 
Brixton. Brixton had a long, active record of supporting the freedom 
struggle and that was presumably registered somewhere.'
