A grandmother was left stranded in Spain after easyJet banned her from flying - for 'touching' an attendant's arm 'to get her attention'.

Janet Kirby, 62, was barred after the airline claimed she 'assaulted' the staff member by twisting her arm as she queued to board at Murcia airport.

But mother-of-two Mrs Kirby, who has two grandchildren, insists she did no such thing and is furious at her treatment, claiming the airline also banned her for life, which it denies.

Mrs Kirby, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, said: 'To be accused of assaulting somebody just for touching them is absolutely ludicrous.

Mrs Kirby, pictured left with her grandson Finley and husband Michael, says she was barred from EasyJet and ordered off a plane after touching a flight attendant on the arm

'I couldn’t believe the way they reacted, the way they treated me was appalling. I have travelled all over the world and I have never been treated or spoken to like that in my life.'

The row started when Mrs Kirby was told her hand luggage was too big and needed to go in the hold. She says when she tried to argue her case she she was ignored repeatedly, so she touched the handler's arm to get her attention.

The staff member summoned a supervisor, who promptly banned Mrs Kirby from the flight.

The grandmother, who was meant to be
flying home to Bristol with sister Carol, said: 'We had paid for 
priority boarding so we should have been among the first to get on the 
plane but when we arrived at the gate there was only one queue.

Grandmother Janet Kirby, 62, was left furious after easyJet stopped her from flying to Bristol from Murcia, Spain, over an alleged assault

'By
the time we got to the front the attendant stopped us and said ‘You, 
you wait there’. She said our bags were too big to fit in the overheard 
lockers and would need to be checked in.

'Carol started to panic as she had a lot of important paperwork with her and didn’t want to let it go.

'She
just kept ignoring us but the whole time she was allowing other 
passengers to board the plane with bags much larger than ours and we 
could see them going across the tarmac with their cases.

'I tried to get her attention by touching her arm and she said, "Do not touch me. You are not flying".'

Mrs
Kirby says the sisters then tried to rebook on to an easyJet flight the
next day but was told she couldn't because she was barred for life.

So
the pair, who had been enjoying a break at Mrs Kirby's holiday home in 
Alfaix, Mojacar, rented a car and drove the two-hour journey back to the
villa.

They finally 
managed to get home yesterday on low-cost rival Ryanair but are still 
furious at their treatment at the hands of the Luton-based airline.

Mrs Kirby's husband, Michael, 65, 
said: 'It seems totally wrong two elderly women can be abandoned in a 
foreign country on the whim of a petty local official.

'Surely
if my wife had committed an assault then she should have been arrested 
or cautioned. But as she was not, then I guess there will be no official
record of this.

'Can airlines just ban somebody on the whim of an employee, who may just have been having a bad day?

Janet Kirby claims easyJet barred her from flying the next day after the row, so she booked with Ryanair instead

'Janet is 62. She’s never had a criminal record and she’s never been arrested.

'Her sister, Carol, had a very traumatic experience at the same airport two-and-a-half years ago, when her husband Graham collapsed and died from a heart attack - so it was doubly upsetting for her.'

Easyjet insist Mrs Kirby is welcome on future flights, including the ones she has booked with the airline to Florence next year, but she says she will never fly with them again.

A spokesman for the airline said: 'The customer has not been banned for life or from any future flights.

'She was prevented from boarding following an incident with a staff member which was witnessed by the police. They supported our decision.'
