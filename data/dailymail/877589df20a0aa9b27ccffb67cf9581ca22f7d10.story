A nurse who fell asleep in a patient’s bed after celebrating New Years Eve has today been struck off the medical register.

Christine Gammack, 48, was 'out of it' when she came into work at Bryn Marl nursing home in Conwy, North Wales on New Year's Day, a hearing heard.

When she pulled into work, she swung in to an ambulance bay and hit a drainpipe, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told.

She even left her morning rounds to swig from a bottle of vodka in her car and tried to disguise the smell with mouthwash, the council heard.

Christine Gammack, 48, was 'out of it' when she turned up for work at Bryn Marl nursing home in Conwy, North Wales, a hearing heard. She was struck off the register after colleagues told how she fell asleep in a patient's bed

Her colleagues then saw Gammack passed out in an elderly patient’s bed.

Nursing home manager John Haydon said: 'She was very drunk. There was no other reason for the way she was that day.

'She had a glazed look on her face. She was unsteady on her feet and her speech was slurred. She kept asking me to help her.'

Mr Haydon called an ambulance to check her out. But the paramedics couldn’t get into the car park - because Gammack’s car was blocking the ambulance bay.

The Council fitness to practice hearing was told Mr Haydon went out to move the car and discovered a quarter full 75cl bottle of vodka in the glove box and a half full bottle of mouthwash.

The nurse's colleagues described how the 48-year-old drank from a bottle of vodka in her car throughout the day - a claim she denies (library image)

But in a statement, Gammack said she had finish drinking before coming to work - and had not had any booze after her shift started.

She said: 'I had consumed alcohol up to a few hours before as sleep eluded me.

'I kept using mouthwash to make sure I didn’t smell of alcohol on that day.'

Gammack, of Denbigh, North Wales, claims she had a panic attack before being taken to hospital and discharged the next day.

She admitted working under the influence of alcohol, sleeping in a patient’s bed and leaving the home without telling the nurse in charge.

The disciplinary panel sitting in Cardiff struck her Gammack off the nursing register for 18 months.

Panel chairman John Matharu said: “It was only through chance that residents were not harmed as a result of her actions and the consequences could have been grave.

'We came to the conclusion that the misconduct, taken together with the lack of full remorse, insight and remediation, are fundamentally incompatible with continuing to be a registered nurse.

'The panel has reached the conclusion that a striking off order is the only order which will sufficiently protect the public interest.'

Gammack, who has previous convictions for drink-driving and common assault, was immediately dismissed by the nursing home for her New Year’s Eve behaviour.
