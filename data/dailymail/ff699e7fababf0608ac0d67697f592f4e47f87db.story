The resplendent Savoy Hotel has been a pioneer for elegance and decadence, since its opening in 1889, and over the years it has certainly seen its fair share of glamour.

The first luxury hotel to open in Britain, the iconic London retreat was where the great and the good went to mingle, creating a spectacular archive of images and anecdotes in the process.

Opening its photo albums to MailOnline Travel, the hotel has revealed stars dancing on the rooftop, giving fashion tips to Savoy pageboys and even pictures of a four-legged guest in the form of a leopard, brought to stay as a pet.

The Savoy was the first hotel in the world to be lit by electricity and have an electric lift, the first to provide 24 hour room service, the first place Marilyn Monroe gave a press conference and even the first hotel to have its own poultry farm during WW2.

It is also a place you can keep your shoes in an air-conditioned wardrobe, a hotel that was in the midst of the Oscar Wilde scandal and where Claude Monet painted views from the windows. 

Although the famous plot has had a number of functions over the years, from a hospital in 1512, to a theatre, The Savoy Hotel opened in its current location on August 6 1889.

Theatre impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte rose from humble beginnings, and through his career of managing musical talent, bought the Savoy Hotel for wealthy tourists who wanted to experience the theatre, which proved to be his most successful venture.

Marilyn Monroe, Winston Churchill, Stephen Fry, Helena Bonham-Carter and The Beatles are among many famous names in the hotel's extensive guest book. 

And yet more stars have trodden the boards at the hotel's theatre, which sits adjacent to the iconic property ion The Strand, in London.

During the First World War the hotel remain unscathed, and morale remained high. Post-war celebrations saw Fred and Adele Astaire and the entire Ballets Russes, continuing their dancing in candlelit rooms at the hotel, after performances.

In World War 2, the hotel acted as a air-raid shelter for guests in what had been the Abraham Lincoln banqueting suite, although dinner and dancing continued as bombs fell.

One bomb blast, which fell on The Strand and Embankment, succeeded in knocking bandleader Carroll Gibbons off the bandstand, and cabaret performer  Noel Coward took over entertaining audiences to rounding applause. 

The first wild animal to be brought to a party at The Savoy was Billy Butlin’s pet leopard who came for a cocktail party to celebrate Smart’s Circus

The hotel has been a backdrop for many extravagant soirees. Among the most notorious was a celebration thrown in 1905 by American millionaire George Kessler.

He requested that the hotel's central court be transformed into a Venetrian scene by filling it with water, and allowing guests to eat in a big gondola. 

The finishing touch to the unforgettable party was a cake delivered at the end by a baby elephant. 

Another notable event was a cocktail party to celebrate Smart's Circus saw Billy Butlin attend accompanied by his pet leopard.

The Savoy was the first luxury hotel to have been built in Britain. It opened in 1889 and was the first hotel to provide the majority of its rooms with private, ensuite bathrooms

The property underwent an extensive £220m refurbishment in 2010, shutting its doors to the public for the first time for more than 18 months.   

It was opened in a lavish event, hosted by HRH Prince Alwaleed, and attended by HRH The Prince of Wales, and Stephen Fry was the first guest of the new facilities. 

The Royal Suite alone cost £2.5m to update, which now features mirrors that turn into televisions, and a £25,000 bed.
