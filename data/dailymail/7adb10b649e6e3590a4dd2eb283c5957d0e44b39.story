Chris Brunt hopes Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Finland can be the first in a series of Windsor wonders for Northern Ireland.

The West Bromwich Albion midfielder has his eyes on his side’s first European Championship finals appearance but Belfast has not always been a happy hunting ground of late. 

‘Our home form wasn’t great in the last campaign,’ Brunt admitted.

Chris Brunt is keen to turn Windsor Park into a fortress to help Northern Ireland qualify for Euro 2016

‘We have started this campaign well with two away wins, but the home win over the Faroes was also an important result.

‘To build on that would be great.

‘In the last few years, those games were the ones that have tended to let us down. Hopefully we can take that on and carry it on in our remaining four home games and we’ll have a great chance of qualifying.’

The West Brom star is hoping to lead his country into Euro 2016 and they currently lie second in the qualifiers
