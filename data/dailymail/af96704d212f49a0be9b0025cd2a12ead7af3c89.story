West Brom striker Brown Ideye is hopeful of being fit in time for the Barclays Premier League home clash with QPR a week on Saturday.

Ideye missed the weekend's 3-0 loss at Manchester City due to a knee problem that has subsequently forced him to pull out of the Nigeria squad.

The 26-year-old, Albion's record signing, told West Brom's website on Wednesday: 'I am in rehab now so hopefully I will be better before the QPR game.

'Somebody kicked me from behind in the Stoke game (on March 14) and since then I've been getting pain.

'I thought I could be fit for Nigeria. I thought I could even be fit for the game at Manchester City. But I couldn't run and I have had to stay back instead of risking it by going to internationals.

'I just have to rest. The pain is still there but the doctors and physios have been doing their best to make sure I'm fit for the (QPR) game.'
