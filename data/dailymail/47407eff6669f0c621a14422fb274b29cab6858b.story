Olympic hero and Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins is gearing up for a cameo role in The Archers.

He will crown the winner when the villagers of Ambridge hold a Sport Relief fundraising event next week.

The four-time gold medallist – who is a lifelong fan of the show – will also encounter a rusty old bike belonging to character Lynda Snell during his guest appearance, according to programme makers.

Sir Bradley will feature in the Radio 4 soap on March 21, the evening on which Sport Relief is broadcast on BBC TV.

The cyclist said: ‘When I was asked to record a Sport Relief special for The Archers, there was no way I could turn it down.

'I grew up with it on the radio in the house, and it’s not every day you get to star in the world’s longest-running soap opera.

‘Meeting the cast, the writer and the director was an honour and I really hope the story line will raise awareness about Sport Relief’s amazing work, and that it shows people that everyone can get involved in Sport Relief this year.’

Sir Bradley is lined up to play a part in about five scenes of the rural soap.

Listeners to last night’s episode heard the first mention of his appearance, as schoolboy Ben Archer said that he had heard a rumour that Sir Bradley will visit the village.

On why he had decided to help Sport Relief, Sir Bradley added: ‘It’s especially important for kids to be active and to get out and get involved.

‘The best thing of all is that the money you raise goes towards helping people living really tough lives.’
