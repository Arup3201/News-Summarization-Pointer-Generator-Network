A Grade II-listed Elizabethan house has been transformed into a swingers' club complete with a fetish dungeon advertising 'leather and lace' parties. 

Stratford House in Highgate, Birmingham, was built in 1601, for local landowner Ambrose Rotton and his wife Bridget.

The beautiful manor house was originally part of a 20-acre farm. 

But now the timber framed property is being advertised online under the name Tudor Lounge and porn stars are listed as being regulars at 'adult themed events'. 

Stratford House, in Highgate, Birmingham, has been transformed into a swingers' club complete with a fetish dungeon advertising 'leather and lace' parties

It is understood the current tenants signed a ten-year lease for the building with current owner, Benjamin Jackson, last March.

The Tudor Lounge website claims to be the UK's most exclusive swingers venue and pictures of scantily clad women are featured, including UK porn stars.

It talks up the history of the building, calling it 'a magnificent Tudor timber oak mansion built in 1601.

'The building has been fully refurbished with only one thing in mind – your pleasure and enjoyment,' reads the website.

'Come and join in our parties or contact us to organize your own. Our facilities are amongst the most impressive you will find in any UK club. The parties will be well attended but totally pressure free, making them ideal for your first visit or experienced swingers alike.'

Birmingham City Council granted temporary change of use planning permission for 'the private members meeting venue' last year and says there were no complaints raised at the time

Couples pay up to £15 or receive free entry to events, while single females receive mostly free entrance, according to the website

The website lists a string of events including a burlesque swingers night last Friday and a 'leather and lace' swingers event planned for this Friday.

The site states club membership is free but the parties charge entry fees for men ranging from £40 to £75. 

Couples pay up to £15 or receive free entry to events, while single females receive mostly free entrance, according to the website.

Visitors can also hire the venue for their own events at £250 for midweek or afternoon bookings, or £300 for Friday or Saturdays.

The website states: 'Our aim is to provide you with a truly fantastic experience, setting a whole new standard for swinging venues in the UK.'

Birmingham City Council granted temporary change of use planning permission for 'the private members meeting venue' last year and says there were no complaints raised at the time. 

But some residents claim they were not consulted, and have urged the council to investigate the house in Stratford Place, which backs onto the playing fields of Calthorpe School and a public park.

One of the bedrooms inside the property includes a large double bed flanked by mirrors, and a generously proportioned jacuzzi

Another of the rooms includes what appears to be a leather bed and fluorescent lighting

One local said: 'I simply can't understand how this could have been allowed to happen in a listed building in an area of regeneration.

'Surely they have to have planning permission. And surely, if so, there should have been public consultation in the area. Nobody asked us about sex clubs.'

A club spokesman defended the use of the building – and insisted that the council knew about the use.

'The council was informed about it all and it was the council that used the label swingers club,' he said.

'We have a long-term lease and have had no complaints.

'We are 15ft from the carriageway and the nearest neighbour is 60m away. All our windows are covered, so no-one can see anything from the outside.'

When asked about the complaints about such an historic property being used for swinging, he said: 'People should mind their own business. Do I go round to their house to see what is going on in there?'

The bathrooms inside are also generously proportioned - with two showers for communal bathing

When asked if sex takes place at the property, he said: 'Sometimes. We are consenting adults.

'More people are involved in swinging than care to admit it.

'Are you going to go round closing down the brothels in Birmingham?'

The spokesman claimed some of the details on the website were inaccurate, but refused to say which ones.

A spokesman for Birmingham City Council initially issued a statement which said: 'According to our records, the Tudor Lounge is not licensed by Birmingham City Council, but we will be investigating whether any activities that would require a licence take place at this premises.'

After being asked about the planning permission claims of the club, a second council statement followed. 'Planning approved a temporary change of use for Stratford House, from office use to a private members meeting venue, for up to one year on 11 April 2014.

'As part of this process, site and press notices were issued and ward members, residents associations and neighbouring premises/residents were consulted, but no responses were lodged.

'The council has not received any complaints in relation to this premises or activities reported to take place.

'Any planning application would be assessed against national and local planning policy, as a private members' club. The temporary consent was given in order for the local planning authority (BCC) to assess any impacts on amenity in the local residential area.

'Licensing officers will be investigating whether any licensable activities, such as the sale of alcohol, take place at this premises, as our records currently show that the Tudor Lounge is not licensed by Birmingham City Council.'

Once called Camp Hill Farm, Stratford House was built in 1601 for Ambrose Rotton and his wife Bridget.

The beautiful manor house was originally part of a 20-acre plot farmed by yeoman Ambrose who kept sheep, cows and pigs.

The house was owned by the family - after whom Rotton Park in Edgbaston is  named - until 1696 and then by the Simcoxes until 1926 when the LMS Railway Company bought it, along with surrounding land.

The railway firm initially threatened to demolish the property because it wanted to expand its goods station at Camp Hill.

Prompted by the Civic Society, the Education Department put forward a proposal to turn Stratford House into a school for the deaf.

But financing problems saw that deal fall through, although Stratford House was saved and remained as LMS offices until 1946, when the railway moved out, In August 1950 the house was officially listed as an ancient monument under the Town & Country Planning Act, giving it official protection.

Ownership details have remained vague since the 1950s, but it was bought by an Ivon Adams, who restored the property to its full glory.

By the 1980s the address was providing office accommodation to Network Records, a techno music production company who stayed there until the 1990s.

Benjamin Jackson was the last named owner of Stratford House according to Land Registry documents which confirm a ten-year lease was signed with an unnamed party on March 7, 2014.
