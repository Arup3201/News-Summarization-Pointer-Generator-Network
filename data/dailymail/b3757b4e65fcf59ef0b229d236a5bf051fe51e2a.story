One in three families in Britain would survive for less than a week if they lost their job, a damning study reveals today.

Around 8.8million households in this country ‘only have £250 or less’ set aside as a financial safety net, which would protect the average family for just five days, according to the report.

In a further blow, the number of struggling families has reached a record high as bills rise relentlessly, but their pay has barely changed for five years.

A damning new study by banking giant HSBC has revealed one in three families wouldn't last a week on their savings. It found 8.8million of the country's 26million households have £250 or less set aside as a financial safety net (stock image)

The report, from the banking giant 
HSBC, found 34 per cent of families have £250 or less of ‘accessible’ 
savings, such as money in their current account, tax-free Isas and 
savings accounts.

This is the highest figure recorded by HSBC, which has conducted the same piece of research every year for the last four years.

In
 2010, the figure was 30 per cent, falling to 28 per cent in 2011, 
rising again to 31 per cent last year and reaching an all-time high of 
34 per cent this year.

Over
 the last year alone, it estimates around 800,000 families have been 
caught in the trap of having either no safety net or one that would last
 for just a few days if disaster struck.

To make matters worse, the most common answer given by these families is that they have no savings at all.

Of
 the 34 per cent who have £250 or less, the report says this comprises 
of 25 per cent with ‘no savings’ while a further 9 per cent have some 
cash set aside.

The average family needs just under £50 a day to survive, according to the report.

This
 is money needed to cover all their typical outgoings from food to 
electricity, council tax to water, transport costs to gas.

For many families, it is not just losing their job which would cause a problem.

Others
 might be tipped over the edge by losing a shift or over-time pay, 
becoming too ill to continue to work full-time or having an unexpected 
bill to pay.

On average, 
HSBC said the average person has a savings pot of £14,400, which would 
last for just over nine months based on an average monthly expenditure 
of £1,500.

However, there 
is a significant gender divide, with 29 per cent of women having no 
‘accessible’ savings compared to only 19 per cent of men.

It
 comes as official figures showed inflation dropped sharply last month, but prices are still rising three times faster than the average 
worker’s pay.

The figures, 
from the Office for National Statistics, show the consumer prices index 
measure of inflation fell from 2.7 per cent in September to 2.2 per cent
 in October.

The Prime 
Minister hailed the ‘significant drop’, which brings down inflation to 
the lowest annual rate since last September, and said it is ‘encouraging
 news for hard-working people’.

But
 the fall in inflation comes amid a backdrop of crippling increases in 
energy bills, paltry pay rises of just 0.7 per cent and rising food 
bills up by 4.3 per cent over the last 12 months.

To
 add to the pressure on families, inflation has been above the 
Government’s target of two per cent for four years during a time when 
pay rises have been below inflation throughout.

The HSBC report was based on survey of 2,035 people in the UK aged 18 and over.
