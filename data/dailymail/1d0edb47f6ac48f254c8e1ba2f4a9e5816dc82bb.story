Shot: Jawaad Jabbar, 16, of Middletown, Ohio, was shot dead after he tried to steal another shopper's Nike Air Jordon sneakers

A teenager was shot dead by another shopper after he tried to rob him of his limited edition Nike Air sneakers at gunpoint.

Jawaad Jabbar, 16, of Middletown, Ohio, had traveled to Dayton Mall in Dayton, Ohio, on Saturday to buy a pair of the popular athletic shoes.

But the shop sold out of them and the teenager became desperate to get hold of a pair. Police said the teen along with two friends spotted two men outside  — one of whom had just bought a pair of the sneakers — and pulled a gun.

However, the shopper was also carrying a gun - and had a permit for it - and shot Jabbar, who died a short time later of a gunshot wound to his torso, authorities said.

Miami Township police  are now studying mall surveillance video  in their investigation of the fatal shooting.

Police Chief Ronald Hess said an initial investigation showed that the teens were outside on a sidewalk when the two men left the mall carrying newly bought shoes. 

Jabbar displayed a gun and demanded their merchandise, then the man with the concealed weapon permit pulled out his gun and shot him. No one else was injured. 

According to police, the two groups didn't know each other, but had all had gone to the mall south of Dayton, Ohio, for Nike Air Jordan sales offered by multiple stores.

The stores had set up systems to avoid long, tense lines that have led to problems elsewhere when the popular brand has released new versions but the Middletown teens missed out.

The other two teens involved in the shooting are being held in juvenile detention while the investigation continues.

Police haven't released the identity of the man who fired the shot, and are still investigating his actions.

'We'll review the whole case with the county prosecutor, and if they determine he violated some law, then yes (he could be charged),' Hess said.  

Jabbar's shocked father, Wallace Jabbar, told The Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News he was 'obviously devastated' over his son's death as he had been out of town working.

Jabbar was a student and athlete at Middletown High School, which is on holiday break. He was desperate to buy the Nike shoes named after retired basketball superstar Michael Jordan. 

The sneakers are so popular that they're often re-sold online for twice the purchase price by both athletes and collectors.

Yet they have sparked a spate of robberies  in New Jersey and Louisiana according to local police.

In 2013, a Springfield, Massachusetts, man was sentenced to up to four years in prison for a shooting that wounded an 11-year-old girl waiting in line at an Air Jordan sale. 

A spokesman for Nike's Jordan Brand said in a statement Tuesday that it encourages people seeking its products to do so in a 'safe and respectful' way.
