Poignant: The Duchess of Cambridge smiled as she arrived but left the cinema in tears

The Duchess of Cambridge broke down in tears when she was told that Nelson Mandela had died, it was revealed last night.

She and Prince William were at a royal premiere in London of a new film about  Mr Mandela’s life when the news was broken to them.

The Duchess, who was sitting next to William during Thursday evening’s screening of Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom, was said to be ‘very moved’ when she was told 15 minutes before the end  of the movie.

And she left the cinema in tears, according to the film’s executive producer Harvey Weinstein.

‘Kate was very emotional, she was in tears and very moved by the events. We all were,’ he said.

‘There is nothing to describe the momentousness of what happened. The Duke and Duchess handled themselves very elegantly.’

But William was also struggling to contain his emotions, Mr Weinstein said.

‘I
 spoke to them downstairs in the foyer after the movie. William was 
deeply touched by the news, you could see it in his face, but he was 
being very courageous.’

Mr 
Weinstein said that it was poignant that William and Kate, who share a 
passion for Africa and were engaged to be married in Kenya, were 
representing the Royal Family.

Arriving for the premiere, the Duchess had walked the red carpet in a floor-length white Roland Mouret dress.

She
 and Prince William had smiled for the cameras as they met the stars of 
the show and Mr Mandela’s daughters Zindzi and Zenani, who had flown to 
London from South Africa for the premiere.

At 6.50pm UK time, minutes 
before the gala screening  was due to start  at the Odeon Leicester 
Square,  Mr Mandela died in South Africa.

A
 Royal protection officer is understood to have told Rebecca Deacon, the
 Duchess’s private secretary,  who was also sitting next to her, that Mr
 Mandela had died.

Miss Deacon then informed the Duke  and Duchess.

William
 and Kate told their aides that they wanted to see the movie to the end 
and they remained in their seats until the credits rolled.

‘Zindzi
 and Zenani left as soon as they heard the news, but they did not want 
to stop the screening,’ Mr Weinstein said. ‘William and Kate said they 
wanted to watch the movie and stayed until the end. We all did. It 
seemed the right thing to do.’

The Duke and Duchess were sitting a few seats away from the British actor Idris Elba, who plays Mr Mandela, and Naomie Harris, who plays the leader’s ex-wife Winnie.

As the credits started rolling, the audience rose for a standing ovation. At this point the Royal couple were escorted out of  the upper circle and downstairs into the foyer by their  security team.

In the auditorium the invited audience were cheering and clapping, most unaware that Mr Mandela had died.

Then an emotional  Mr Elba, film director Justin Chadwick and the producer Anant Singh came down from the upper  circle to address  the audience.

‘President Zuma has announced the passing of Madiba,’ Mr Singh told a now silent audience. ‘President Zuma said Madiba had departed and was at peace. Our nation has lost its greatest son.’

Tears: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were visibly upset when they left the premiere of Mandela: A Long Walk To Freedom

As the credits continued to roll,  Mr Singh asked for a minute’s silence.

Many of the guests, who were dressed in black tie for a planned after-party, were in tears.

Many were still crying as they spilled into the chilly foyer.

The film-makers agreed to cancel the after-party as a mark of respect to Mr Mandela.

The movie is due  to be released in the UK on January 3.  It has already broken box office records  in South Africa.

Nelson Mandela’s funeral cortege will travel through the streets of South Africa’s capital for three consecutive days ahead of his burial.

In what will be remarkable scenes, thousands of mourners are being urged by the government to line the route and ‘form a public guard of honour’.

The cortege will leave a military hospital on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday mornings to go to the Union Buildings  in Pretoria, the official seat of government and administrative capital, where Mr Mandela  will lie in state in a glass-topped coffin.

There, South Africans will have the opportunity to file past his body and say a final farewell, but, amid tight security, they will not be allowed to bring phones or cameras inside.

‘We call on members of the public to co-operate with the authorities to ensure that this event is dignified and secure,’ said government minister Collins Chabane yesterday.

In  a state funeral that may even eclipse that of Princess Diana in 1997, world leaders will arrive  in South Africa this week for  the ‘ten-day remembrance’  of the former president.

A set-piece memorial service will be held on Tuesday. It was originally scheduled to be held in Pretoria but due to demand was moved to a football stadium in Soweto. It is expected to be led by Mr Mandela’s friend, Desmond Tutu.

In what could turn into a logistical nightmare, heads of state from around the world are also invited to the funeral next Sunday, which is being held in Mr Mandela’s isolated home village of Qunu, Eastern Cape.

The 95-year-old anti-apartheid icon will be buried in a family plot alongside his children who predeceased him.

David Cameron and Prince Charles – and possibly the Queen – are expected to fly to South Africa but it is not known if they will travel to Qunu.

President Obama, who is expected at Qunu, and former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have confirmed they will be in South Africa next week.
