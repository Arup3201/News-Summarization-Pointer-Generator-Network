Dozens of pit bull owners paraded with their dogs in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to mark their legal victory that overturned its decade-long ban on the breed.

About 40 dogs and their owners on Sunday celebrated a Superior Court judge's November 18 ruling which overturned the sanction.

Pawtucket Police Chief Paul Kelly said the city imposed the ban in 2004 to try to curtail the number of pit bull attacks on residents.

At the time of the ban, Kelly said local drug dealers were using pit bulls to prevent police from house raids, posing a hazard to the officers.

Supporters of the piece of breed-specific legislation said the incident rate dropped substantially after its enactment.

However, in 2013 the state  barred cities from banning specific breeds. Then last Tuesday the news broke that pit bulls had been legalized in Pawtucket.

Dog owners say authorities should 'punish the deed, not the breed.'

Stereotyped? More than 700 U.S. cities still have breed-specific laws banning pit bulls - Many local policies permit the breed but classify it as 'dangerous' and 'vicious'

The parade, put on by the non-profit organization Pit Bulls for PTSD, started at Slater Park and proceeded up Newport Avenue and back around to the park. 

It ended with a free dog training session.

Ann Clark, vice president of Pit Bulls for PTSD, told NBC News that pit bulls are a 'wonderful breed.'

'People blame the wrong end of the leash. It's all about how you raise them, how you care for them,' she continued.

Pit Bulls for PTSD trains pit bulls to become service dogs for people with post-traumatic stress disorder and children with autism.
