A photo has emerged of the moment a police officer sprayed a handcuffed football fan in the face with pepper spray.

The image was taken by a Getty photographer on Saturday during a Michigan Wolverines game against the Penn State Nittany Lions at Beaver Stadium in State College, Pennsylvania. 

The man had allegedly struck a female usher and was resisting arrest when he was sprayed.

The Michigan fan appears to have his arms secured behind his back by police officers as they try to escort him away from the crowd.

But the man's face is contorted in pain as the painful anti-riot device is blasted near his right eye.

Photos show he had already been sprayed in his left eye leaving a trail of what appears to be blood across his face.

Some members of the crowd are oblivious or unperturbed by the scene as they smile and clap during the long game which started at 5pm, while others turn and watch in shock.

A man called Bryan claimed to be at the scene and told Dead Spin:
'I was sitting in the section next to this guy. He was standing for 
every play with his buddy and became confrontational with those around 
him.

'The people behind we're getting 
p***** and some lady actually had enough and hit him. Mid way through 
the 2nd after Michigan had scored he started taunting everyone and it 
looked like he was about to start a fight in the stands.

'Security
came up and escorted him down to the front when he grabbed the railing 
and refused to leave. He ended up talking some swings at the state 
police who were arresting which is why he got pepper sprayed.'

Pepper spray is an aerosol spray containing oils obtained from cayenne pepper. It is irritating to the eyes and respiratory passages and used as a disabling device.

It is generally used by spraying it directly into an individual’s eyes, forcing them to close them.

The spray gives a burning sensation which will last approximately 30 minutes.

The idea behind the use of a pepper spray is that the receiver suffers from reduced vision and is therefore less likely to approach police in a threatening way.

There are many criticisms of the use of pepper spray ranging from the fact that it does not work on all individuals to the suggestion it could cause more damage to the eyes than first thought.

Penn State Police Chief Tyrone Parham acknowledged the incident in a statement released by the university Monday.

'Fans in section NL asked an usher for assistance when the man became disruptive and offensive toward them.

'When the usher tried to eject him from the stadium, he allegedly struck her, which is when police were called to assist.

'Four officers responded - two from State College and two from Penn State - but when they tried to remove him from the stadium he continued spewing expletives, became physical and resisted arrest.

'At that point it became a safety issue and that's when the decision was made to use the pepper spray and attempt to handcuff him.'
