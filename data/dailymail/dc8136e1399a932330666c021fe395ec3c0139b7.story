Out of luck: Lottery winner Robert Moffat leaves Falkirk Sheriff Court after pleading guilty to crashing his father's car while five times the drink-drive limit

A former barman who enjoyed the trappings of wealth after scooping £800,000 on the lottery hung his head in shame today as he admitted being a drink-driver now living on benefits.

Robert Moffat became one of Scotland's first big-money winners when he took a share of his family's £3.5million pay-out.

Happily married with a daughter, he surrounded himself with life's luxuries - a plush Range Rover stood in the driveway of his home while a lovingly restored classic Triumph sports car gleamed in he garage. Both had personal registration plates.

However, Falkirk Sheriff Court heard how he had now lost it all, including his wife, Michelle, and was currently unemployed.

Moffat, of Denny, Stirlingshire, admitted driving with an alcohol count of 186 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 35mcg.

His pleas of not guilty to two further charges - failing to give information to the police as to who was the driver and failing to co-operate with a preliminary breath test - were accepted by the Crown.

Mark Keane, prosecuting, said that a member of the public phoned the police at 5pm on December 30 after seeing a car crashed into a pavement bollard at Northfield Rd, Denny.

The depute fiscal said the driver was Moffat - at the wheel of his father’s X-type Jaguar.

Mr Keane said: 'As he approached the locus, he lost control, striking a bollard on the pavement. As a result, the front of the car was damaged.

'The member of the public saw the car with the engine still running. The sole occupant of the car got out and walked off up the road.'

He added said: 'The witness was of the opinion that the driver was under the influence of alcohol and he reported the matter to police.'

Moffat was traced and taken to a police station where he admitted it was his father’s car and said 'sorry'.

He gave a sample of breath for analysis and the reading, which amounts to over 5.3 times the limit, was obtained.

Defence solicitor Dick Sandeman said: 'Mr Moffat has had a particularly hard time over the past year or so. He lost everything he had in his business and his wife and he split up. He has a drink difficulty.'

He added that lottery winner was now unemployed, on Jobseekers allowance, and he offered to pay any financial penalty at £10 a week.

Sheriff Vinit Khurana deferred sentence for three weeks for background reports in view of the high reading. He disqualified Moffat from driving in the interim.

Moffat’s life was made a misery when a former girlfriend claimed he was the father of her son, Robert, from a short-lived affair.

After he landed lucky with the lottery cash, he found himself in the same court defending a bitter paternity action filed by Caroline Thomson of Maddiston, Falkirk.

Former Falkirk Sheriff Andrew Murphy threw the case out when DNA tests proved Moffat could not be the boy’s dad.
