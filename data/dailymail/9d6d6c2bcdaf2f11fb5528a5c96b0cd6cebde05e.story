Manchester City face an increasingly difficult battle to explain Yaya Toure’s bizarre behaviour this summer after the Barclays Premier League champions’ star player claimed he would be open to a move to Paris Saint-Germain.

Toure has cast a cloud over City’s post-season title celebrations with some peculiar antics over the past week.

First, the Ivorian midfielder’s agent Dimitry Seluk claimed that Toure had been upset City didn’t give him a birthday cake when he turned 31 recently. Then Toure - who had actually received two cakes from the club  admitted he would consider a transfer back to former club Barcelona.

Speculation: Yaya Toure has fuelled rumours he will leave Man City by saying PSG move would be 'an honour'

Fans favourite: Toure scored 24 goals in 49 games for Man City last season

Now City’s top earner has given an 
interview to a French publication in which he reveals a transfer to the 
French champions would also appeal.

Toure told France Football: 
‘Given the goals of Paris, how could you not be interested in a club 
like that? PSG have become one of the strongest teams in Europe. It 
would be an honour to one day play for a club like that - if I can be of
 service.

‘Given the magnificent season Manchester City have had, 
everyone talks about me and everything is open. My agent is hanging on 
the telephone and he knows what he has to do, I have complete confidence
 in him.

‘Nobody knows what can happen tomorrow, my attention is on the World Cup and we will see afterwards.

‘Yes, I have said I would like to finish my career at Barcelona. You never know because football moves quickly.’

Seluk
 said last week that he rated Toure staying at City as ‘50-50’ and the 
player’s comments about PSG will only increase speculation he is looking
 to move on.

City are viewing the whole charade in its true 
perspective, given that Seluk is prone to these bizarre tactics whenever
 he feels his star client is due a new contract.

No comment: Toure failed to respond when asked where he would be playing next season

Toure - who earns 
around £250,000-a-week at the Etihad Stadium - got himself a new deal 
last summer but won’t be so lucky this time.

In all likelihood, he 
will merely have to explain his comments to manager Manuel Pellegrini 
when he joins City for pre-season training in America after the World 
Cup.

All City’s World Cup players will be given a month off from the
 day they exit the tournament, so it appears likely Toure will catch up 
with Pellegrini in New York unless the Ivory Coast progress beyond the 
last eight.

Birthday-gate: Man City posted a picture of the cake that was presented to Toure on his birthday

Seluk, meanwhile, continues to veer erratically from one 
standpoint to another. Yesterday he suggested Toure would even accept a 
backroom role at City once his career is over.

This is highly 
unlikely, especially as Toure’s stock among supporters begins to fall.  
Yesterday, for example, the Manchester Evening News expressed the view 
that this latest episode has tarnished Toure’s standing for good.

Seluk
 said: ‘A role at City after his (playing) career? Of course. Like Real 
Madrid have done with Zinedine Zidane, for example. Zidane played there 
and afterwards began working for the club.

‘Yaya will need a club in 
the future. We do not want more money or a longer contract, anything 
like that, just the right attention. More attention on Yaya and that he 
feels happy at the club — that is the most important thing. We do not 
need more money.’
