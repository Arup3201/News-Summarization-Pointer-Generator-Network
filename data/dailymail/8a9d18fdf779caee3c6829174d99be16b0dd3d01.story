The Secret Service was unaware for four days that a man had fired a high-powered rifle at the White House in 2011 in a 'fumbled' response that left the Obamas furious, says a new report.

Officers allegedly performed a string of security lapses after Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez shot at least seven bullets at the executive mansion in Washington from his car. 

At the time, President Barack Obama, his wife Michelle and their older daughter Malia were not at home, but their younger daughter Sasha and Mrs Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, were inside.

It comes as the Secret Service is facing more questions over its ability to protect the first family after a knife-wielding man jumped the White House fence and made it to the front doors last Friday.

The agency's apparently bungled response to the shooting on November 11, 2011, was detailed last night in an investigation by The Washington Post.

In the incident, Ortega-Hernandez, then 21, parked his black Honda south of the mansion, before pointing his semi-automatic pistol out of the passenger window.

He then aimed it directly at the Obamas' home and fired off a series of bullets, one of which smashed a window on the second floor, just inches from the family's living room.

Another bullet got stuck in a window frame, while others smashed into the roof, causing nearly $100,000 worth of damage.

Within seconds of the shots, a White House usher reportedly expressed concerns about the safety of Malia, who was due to arrive back at the mansion imminently.

The usher told the staff to keep her sister Sasha and Ms Robinson inside, before locking all of the doors after Malia returned with her detail at 9.40pm, the Post said.

Weapon: Secret Service officers, in accordance with protocol, rushed to respond, before they were reportedly told 'No shots have been fired... stand down', by their supervisor. Above, the gun used by Ortega-Hernandez

Meanwhile, Secret Service officers, in accordance with protocol, rushed to respond, with one stationed under the second-floor terrace withdrawing her handgun.

However, they reportedly halted their response when they were wrongly informed, 'No shots have been fired... stand down', by their supervisor.

The supervisor claimed the noise had instead stemmed from the backfire from a nearby construction vehicle, the Post said.

Even after the fact that shots were fired had been confirmed,  supervisors initially theorized that rival gangs in separate cars had gotten into a gunfight near the mansion's front lawn, it said.

Executive mansion: It apparently took the Secret Service four days to conclude that gunshots had struck the White House (pictured) - with their findings mainly based on the discovery of broken glass by a housekeeper

The shots were reportedly only connected to the White House four days later when a housekeeper noticed broken glass and a chunk of cement lying on the floor inside. 

Less than a week later, Mrs Obama, who had arrived back in Washington from Hawaii after spending the Veterans Day weekend with her husband, reportedly arranged a meeting with then-Secret Service Director Dan Sullivan. 

During the encounter, she addressed Mr Sullivan so sharply that she could be heard through a closed door, the Post reported. 

Angry: President Obama was 'infuriated' by the Secret Service's response to the shooting

President Obama, who was continuing from Hawaii to Australia, was also said to have been 'infuriated' by the Secret Service's response to the shooting. 

One day after the broken glass was spotted, Ortega-Hernandez, from Idaho, was arrested. He was later sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to firing an assault rifle at the White House.

Although prosecutors had initially charged Ortega-Hernandez with attempting to assassinate President Obama, they agreed to drop the charge as part of a plea deal last year. 

The Post alleges that some Secret Service officers knew immediately that shots had been fired into the White House, but that they were 'largely ignored'.

'Some were afraid to dispute their bosses' conclusions' that the shooting was not directed at the White House, it said.

The agency allegedly conducted only a cursory inspection of the White House for evidence or damage, while key witnesses were not interviewed until after bullets were found.  

The suspect was able to park his car on a public street, take several shots and then speed off without being detected, the Post noted.

It added that it was 'sheer luck' that Ortega was identified as the shooter, mainly because the troubled and jobless 21-year-old wrecked his car seven blocks away and left his gun inside. 

The recent allegations were unearthed by the Post following interviews with agents, investigators and government officials, as well as the review of hundreds of documents. 

It comes just a week after Omar Gonzalez, 42, was arrested inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn, the Secret Service said.

President Obama and his family were not in the mansion at the time.

White House pair: Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Iraq veteran (left) and Kevin Carr, a 19-year-old college student (right) were both arrested after trying to get into the White House within 24 hours of one another

Less than 24 hours later, Kevin Carr, 19, was taken in by officers after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point then refusing to leave when he was asked.

The two attempts to gain entry to the White House prompted the Secret Service to increase security by stepping up patrols around the building.

It has been suggested they could set up security checkpoints around the building for the public.

In a statement to the Associated Press, the Secret Service said it 'implemented both personnel and structural enhancements' following a review of the 2011 incident.

It also employed 'other physical and technical enhancements, including additional surveillance cameras.'

A Secret Service official, who requested anonymity for lack of authorization to comment for attribution, said the delay in understanding what happened that night was not the result of misconduct or incompetence.

Instead, they said it was 'an uncertain situation' that included echoing shots from a quarter mile away and confused initial witness reports.

'I'm not saying this was our shining moment, but we never stopped looking for this guy,' the official said.
