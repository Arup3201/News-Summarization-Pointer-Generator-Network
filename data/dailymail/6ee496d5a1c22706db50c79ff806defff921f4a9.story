Exposed to blistering temperatures, inhaling thick smoke and putting their bodies on the line to extinguish the flames.

These are the conditions front-line firefighters are faced with while battling the devastating bushfires burning across the Adelaide Hills.

Footage of inside the inferno, which is the worst since the Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983, has been taken by Burnside Country Fire Service volunteer firefighter Ben Wilson, whose team has been out trying to tame the fires since Friday.

The Adelaide Hills fires have been burning since Friday and temperatures are set to soar to 38 degrees Celsius on Tuesday and Wednesday

In South Australia, the Ash Wednesday bushfires killed 28 people. Luckily so far, the only thing the fire has claimed are properties.

With a GoPro strapped to the photographer's helmet, viewers get a first-hand look of what firefighters are working to contain as temperatures are expected to hot 38 degrees Celsius on Tuesday and Wednesday.

In the eight-minute video, firefighters are seen trying to put out spot fires at Sampson Flat as smoke surrounds them and thicker plumes billow in the distance, with light from the fire turning the sky orange. 

The team Mr Wilson was with were very experienced - the cab officer and driver alone had 70 years between them.

'They knew exactly what was going on, and sometimes conditions can look a lot worse than they are,' he said.

'We did what we needed to do and got the job done. We were highly trained and knew what we needed to do.'

Mr Wilson has been a volunteer for CFS for nine years and he has battled fires on Kangaroo Island where flames were 300 metres high.

'We were a kilometre away but that means it could get to us in ten seconds,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

But he had not seen any fires as bad as what he has seen in South Australia.

'The flames were crowning the top of trees, and through the clouds... The inferno was the worse thing I’ve ever seen in my life,' he said.

'That kind of fire is crazy, that's why the fire is out on control still because you can't put bombers on it. The water would evaporate before it hit the fire.'

Mr Wilson said the conditions had been a massive shock to firefighters as it had not been brought under control in five days, even with the help of 200 volunteer firefighters from both South Australia's CFS along with 200 NSW crew members and 40 from the Metropolitan Fire Service.

'That's a huge amount of people and we still haven't got it under control. You think, "put water on flame" and it goes out, but that’s not how it works.

'Wednesday will be a very questionable day. The weather isn't looking positive, and everyone is knuckling down and preparing. 

But Mr Wilson reassured people firefighters were more than up for the task.

Thick smoke is seen rising sky high over the Adelaide Hills, which is a popular tourist destination in South Australia

It is thought more than 400 firefighters were battling the blaze on Sunday as hot temperatures could worsen the blaze

In the eight-minute video, Mr Wilson is seen putting out spot fires with a hose along with assisting other crew members

The sun is seen burning a bright orange through the thick smoke billowing over the region, which is 26km away from Adelaide's CBD

At one stage, Mr Wilson is so overwhelmed by smoke he starts coughing violently as it blows over a property he is defending

He and his colleagues kick into action as flames surround a property they arrive at, which has flames just centimetres away from sheds

And this is made evident by the way crew members executed their sweep of the Sampson Flat house.

Firefighters leapt into action, grabbing a hose to extinguish the fires as well as protecting the house by dousing its gutters with water as the sun is seen shining through the smoke with a red ring around it.

As firefighters continued to storm the property, the video shows how close the fire is burning, with flames just centimetres away from setting a garden shed alight.

At one point a plane is seen flying over the house as what it is believed to be the sound of smoke alarms break through the eerie silence.

'When we were rolling up to the house within minutes it had jumped a good 500 metres. An ember sparked and all the other trucks went down to road where the fire was but we went up to the house where the fire front actually was,' Mr Wilson told Daily Mail Australia.

'Seeing something like that shows exactly how out of our hands it can be. We saved one house, and we did the best in that area we could.

'That's one less house on the tally.'

Mr Wilson said the most devastating thing on the job was seeing people lose their homes.

'You see people waiting on the side of the road at road closures, not able to get back in and you can tell that they know they've lost their home.

'It's sad to see when people could have saved their house by being prepared and end up losing their homes.

'Everyone thinks "I'll be right, we'll be ready" or they think they'll leave if it gets bad.

'Some houses are really hard to save. Unless they cut down huge trees and even if they do prepare it's tough. 

'We have a fire truck and we still struggled to save the house.'

In the video, Mr Wilson is also seen running over to a shed where hay is kept, while a colleague looks to be watering it down so the fire cannot use the tinder to spread.

Mr Wilson takes up an axe to break-up wood lining the walls of the blackened tin shed to prevent it from re-igniting.

A thick smoke blows over the house and it becomes too much for him as he starts coughing violently to clear his lungs. 

As the crew travel along the road, they put out spot fires they drive past with a quick spritz of the house to stop it from spreading

Mr Wilson worked to spray down leaves in gutters to ensure the house would not catch alight

Firefighters from all over Australia have been helping battle the blaze since Sunday, with conditions the worst since 1983

In 1983, the Ash Wednesday bushfires in South Australia claimed 28 lives and destroyed 51 homes

Despite getting an upclose and personal look at the sheer destruction of the fire, Mr Wilson said 'the biggest thing' he had seen during the bushfires was people's willingness to help.

'I've had so many people call me and ask "What can we do?". They've said "I'll deliver sandwiches and water, I can offer shelter and storage",' he said.

'It's crazy how much citizens are banding together to help out, this doesn't normally happen.

'People realise that every little bit counts. If someone donates six bottles of water, that's six firefighters who don’t have to buy it out of their own pockets when they’re already giving their time.'

As for how Mr Wilson deals with fear, he said he tried not to focus on it while out on a job but on helping people.

'I've never experienced fear to the extent where I thought we'd die. I mean, we're all human and fear will kick in, but as a firefighter you need to be push that aside and operate on your skills and listen to your officers,' he said.

'We'll never be forced into a situation that we aren't comfortable with.

'What drives me is the ability to be able to help people who are in a situation where they can't help themselves. 

'All voluntary things are great. You're there on your own time which means your heart is in it, and because it means people really care.'
