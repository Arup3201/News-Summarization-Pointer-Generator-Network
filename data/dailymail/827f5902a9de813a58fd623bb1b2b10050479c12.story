Britons could be more at risk of terrorism because plans to widen access to flight passenger records are tied up in Brussels red tape.

Security chiefs are increasingly concerned about the growing wave of potential jihadists travelling to and from lawless Syria.

But a directive obliging airlines to pass details of European passengers to the authorities has been blocked on human rights grounds.

Last night, it emerged that the European Union’s anti-terror chief has told ministers that they must make better use of airline passenger data.

In a leaked document, Gilles de Kerchove said foreign fighters travelling to Syria where they can undergo terrorist training poses a ‘major security threat’.

His comments came after Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer warned that the country is under threat from ‘fly-drive’ terrorists.

Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, of the Met, said young men are flying to Turkey where they hire a car and drive across the Syrian border.

She warned that a small number could fall under the spell of terrorists and return to Britain with deadly skills and motivation.

Legislation to force airlines to pass on passenger details remains stuck in the labyrinthine corridors of Brussels bureaucracy.

This is despite the practice being routine in many other parts of the world in changes implemented after the September 11 attacks.

The Civil Liberties Committee of the European Parliament rejected the directive in April and its future remains unclear.

The changes were first presented more than two years ago as an anti-terrorism measure to be applied for passengers flying in and out the European Union.

It would see data including passenger name, address, phone number and payment details being passed to the security services.

Supporters of the bill said it would help track terrorists, people traffickers and other serious criminals who regularly cross international borders.

But critics raised privacy concerns and said police could store the information for up to five years, effectively leading to passenger profiling.

Brussels watchers predict the Edward Snowden affair has further damaged the chances of getting the changes implemented.

The National Security Agency contractor stole a huge cache of secrets which laid bare the scale of surveillance by his employer and other agencies, including GCHQ.

The note from the office of EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator highlights how the number of fighters traveling to Syria is increasing.

It specifically calls for better use of airline passenger information available to security officials to keep track of when and how rebels move to Syria.

The note says Europe should co-operate more closely with Turkey and help it improve controls at borders and airports.

‘There are cases where individuals continue traveling back and forth,’ it said.

Experts estimate there are up to 1,700 foreign fighters among rebel forces, including several hundred from Britain.

This is a substantial increase from the figure of between 600 and 800 who were believed to be there just a few months ago.

Belgian Interior Minister Joelle Milquet said: ‘We have to anticipate the returns, the ways to handle this, the prevention measures and especially the exchange of information on the travels.’

Last month, Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, said spies have seen ‘low hundreds of people’ travel to Syria and that some have returned to the UK.
