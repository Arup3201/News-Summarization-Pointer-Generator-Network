Troopers used a stun gun to subdue a man who drove his pickup truck up the steps of the state Capitol building, authorities said.

Utah Highway Patrol Capt. Barton Blair told The Salt Lake Tribune that state troopers watching security cameras saw the man's truck climb about two dozen of the granite steps on the west side of the building and park outside.

The unarmed man then left his car and attempted to enter a ceremonial Supreme Court room on the third floor, which was locked and is not regularly used by the court.

The man said he had the right to be there and said the Capitol was his home, Blair said. Troopers then deployed a stun gun and wrestled the man to the ground.

The man's name was not released, but Blair said he was in his 30s and from Layton, about 20 miles away.

One officer injured his hand while arresting the man.

UHP spokesman Cpl. Todd Johnson told The Associated Press he had few details yesterday evening, including details about the man's identity.

Tyler Davis, who works for a law firm and was at the Capitol for business Tuesday, said he watched the event unfold from the second floor, which offers a view of the Supreme Court doors.

Davis said he heard the man yelling, 'Let me in the Supreme Court!' as two officers tried to calm him down.

'He wanted to get in there,' Davis told the AP. 'He said, "Grab the keys, let me in!"'

Davis said he saw officers then use a stun gun on the man.

The man was quiet after that, and emergency workers wheeled him away on a stretcher, Davis said.

'It was really quick and really out of the blue,' he said.
