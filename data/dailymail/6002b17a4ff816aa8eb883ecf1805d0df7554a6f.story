A wife-killing double rapist has been caught begging and claiming to be homeless, despite being given a free council flat after his release from prison.

Stuart Durkin, branded a 'beast' by a judge, begs on the streets of London even though he lives in a £400,000 taxpayer-funded flat and claims benefits.

Durkin lives in trendy St John's Wood, north London, and claims £70 incapacity benefit a week, raking in £25,480 over the last seven years after breaking his hip in 2008.

He was caught pestering people for change outside a Tesco near Paddington Station, telling the Sun on Sunday that he was made homeless when his girlfriend left him.

He said: 'I've got a sofa to stay on sometimes but I need money for food. I can't get any benefits.'

However, back at his one-bedroom flat, which could be rented privately for up to £1,500 a month, Durkin admitted he had a roof over his head in an area where around 4,400 families are waiting for social housing. 

The 53-year-old, originally from Leeds, still complained: 'It's a wreck. There was a flood two years ago and the council still hasn't redecorated.'

Durkin was jailed in 1984 for the manslaughter of his Swedish wife, receiving a six-year sentence.

But he was back in the UK by 1988, when he was jailed for 12 years for breaking into a bedsit and raping a woman.

After serving half of his sentence, Durkin was released and he moved to Rome, where he became known as 'The King' among fellow beggars.

He was jailed once again for the rape and attempted murder of a German tourist to the Italian city, but was extradited to the UK in 2004 to serve the remainder of his sentence.

Durkin was freed in 2007, when he was given the free council flat.

The serial criminal was back in court again in 2012 after having sex with unsuspecting women at the Occupy London camp at Finsbury Park, north London.

He was jailed for 24 weeks after admitting failing to comply with sex offender notification requirements.

At the Old Bailey sentencing, Recorder Nigel Peters QC said: 'What's clear is that you are someone who has a history of violent offences and sexual offences and are clearly somebody who is considered at the highest risk end of involvement in offences involving sexual matters and violence.'
