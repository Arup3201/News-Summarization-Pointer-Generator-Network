Who’d be an England captain? Mitchell Johnson gets out on the right side of bed. Your match-winning spinner quits. Your star persona becomes non grata. Your rock at No 3 falls ill. Your coach packs it in. You lose at home to Sri Lanka. Then Trent Bridge hands you a surface with less life in it than one of MS Dhoni’s press conferences.

The irony of the Nottingham Test is that Alastair Cook enjoyed one of his best matches as captain. I know, I know: this is not necessarily saying much. And there was still plenty he could have done differently.

But he was inventive with his field settings, treated Moeen Ali’s off-spin with respect, and even proved his sense of humour hasn’t deserted him by producing an uncanny impersonation of Bob Willis. Making people smile won’t affect his chances of holding on to the Test captaincy, though the japes suggested a sense of perspective.  We could all do with a bit of that.

On his knees: Alastair Cook had a good Test as England captain but could not inspire that elusive victory

In any case, the alternative was bursting into tears. When Cook compared the surface to the one served up by the unfortunate Praveen Hingnikar, head groundsman at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium at Nagpur, in December 2012 – when India had to beat England to salvage a draw – he confirmed just how over-my-dead-body grudging the Trent Bridge pitch really was.

English cricket needs something to cheer about right now. The Test team are in the middle of their most winless sequence for over 20 years, and many fans feel alienated following the Kevin Pietersen affair. Suddenly, we’re forced to recall just how good England had it for the vast majority of Andy Flower’s reign. Hell, it used to be the case that we expected to beat Australia.

The visit of India, complete with abysmal overseas record and inexplicably cautious captain, appeared to offer a crack at redemption. And then Steve Birks, no doubt with the blessing of the suits at Nottinghamshire, produced a track that would have neutered Harold Larwood. Sometimes, you can’t catch a break.

The harsh fact remains that England have won none of their last nine Tests, and Cook has not scored a century for 26 innings. And while he was unlucky to be bowled behind his legs, he exposed his leg stump because he was so concerned about moving across to the off stump to deal with his tendency to nick good-length balls. In trying to solve one issue, he created another.

Lord’s is shaping up as a crucial moment in Cook’s career. If two more batting failures are combined with a draw or an Indian win, his apologists will be running out of straws to clutch. A century in a draw would help; a pair of failures in an England win would not count against him either. But it is the combination – no runs, no wins – that becomes debilitating.

England actually had two openings in Nottingham to India’s one. The first came when India slipped to 346 for nine in their first innings, only for their last pair to add 111. The second was on the final morning, when Liam Plunkett bowled Dhoni.

India’s opening, by contrast, lasted much longer, as England recovered from 202 for seven to 496 all out. But it was the collapse from 134 for one that will be of most concern. England suffered the same fate twice against Sri Lanka at Headingley. Collapses are what mediocre sides do, no matter whether your No 11 can dig you out of a hole.

There is clearly spirit in this England side. We saw it on the last day in Leeds, and we saw it during the world-record stand of 198 between Joe Root and Jimmy Anderson. But their frustration with the authorities is palpable: both Sri Lanka and India have been greeted by surfaces more akin to Colombo and Kolkata, and next is up will be another flat’un at Lord’s.

At some point over the next few weeks, Anderson or Stuart Broad may keel over. Five Tests in 42 days is bad enough – but five Tests in 42 days on pitches designed to help the host venue’s bottom line rather than the home team’s bowling figures is simply unaccountable.

There is a less Anglo-centric reason to grumble, too. Dhoni himself made the point on Sunday evening that, when you play abroad, you expect to encounter the home conditions. It’s what makes Test cricket so engrossing.

Right now, English pitches seem to be going the way of the Caribbean – slower, lower, more heart-breaking, more injury-inducing. Most crucially, the cricket becomes boring. Nottinghamshire may have got the fifth day they so obviously craved, but at what cost to the game as a whole?

As this column never tires of pointing out, when the business ousts the sport, the sport invariably suffers.

Before the Trent Bridge Test, MS Dhoni suggested that the ‘processes’ were more important than the results. The game over, he was at it again: ‘You don’t always want results in your favour but what you want is to see the team improving.’

He makes it sound as if India are a team in constant transition, forever preparing for the next battle while ignoring the current one. India’s fans may think they deserve better.

Part of the process: MS Dhoni is adamant India are more interested in the means rather than the end

Simon Kerrigan is back in the England squad, less than a year after his left-arm spin was pummelled by Shane Watson at The Oval. This episode has generally attracted the kinds of adjectives and nouns more readily associated with a horror movie, but it seems Kerrigan can see his analysis for 8-0-53-0 for what it is.

Asked on Sunday what he had learned from the experience, he replied: ‘That the sun will come up the next day. It is not the end of the world.’ The Top Spin likes him even more after that.

When Sachithra Senanayake was reported by match officials following the one-day international at Lord’s in May because of a suspect bowling action, Sri Lanka privately fumed that this was all England’s fault. Now the ICC have banned him.

It’s all very well turning a sense of grievance to your advantage, as Sri Lanka did for the rest of their stay in England, but at some point the basic mechanics of the game will assert themselves. You probably can’t blame England for that.

If you’re at a loose end next week, you 
could do a lot worse than head for Wormsley, the stunning venue carved 
out of the Chiltern Hills by Sir Paul Getty in 1992. There, from 
Thursday July 24 through to Saturday July 26, the Words and Wickets 
cricket and literature festival will be taking place – including a 
special celebration of John Arlott, who was born 100 years ago in 
February. It all sounds like great fun. More information here: www.wordsandwickets.com
