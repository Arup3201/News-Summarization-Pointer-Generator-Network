An airport runway was closed and flights diverted after an unexploded World War II bomb was found next to a highway close to Frankfurt airport.

The 500kg device was discovered during construction work on a stretch of the A3 highway near Offenbach.

Police shut off a 1,000 metre area of the autobahn, which is one of the busiest stretches of road in the country, causing long traffic jams.

One of the airport's four runways was then closed for landings after experts warned that aircraft should avoid flying over the bomb site.

The device had been outfitted with a chemical detonator, increasing the difficulty of the bomb disposal's job, who finally decided to destroy it in a controlled explosion after detonation was deemed impossible. 

Planes were allowed to take off from the runway, but only in the direction away from the bomb site.

Live bombs dating back to the aerial bombing of Germany during World War II are still frequently found. Most local authorities have teams working full-time to detect and defuse them.

In May, bomb disposal experts were called  to Reddish, in Manchester, after a live World War Two bomb was found in an outside toilet.

Police evacuated people from 10 houses on the street and neighbouring roads for around two hours, and set up a 100m cordon.

The device was taken to nearby Reddish Vale Country Park where a controlled explosion was carried out.
