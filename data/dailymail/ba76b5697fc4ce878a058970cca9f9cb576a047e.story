There were incredible scenes on Dutch TV tonight after a teenage gunman stormed the studios of the national broadcaster and demanded to be put on air.

NOS went off air for an hour after the smartly dressed suspect, who was carrying a silenced pistol, seized control of the studio. 

But cameras continued to roll, recording the moment police rushed into to disarm him.

According to a reporter from the broadcaster who spoke to the the gunman, who is thought to be a 19-year-old student, he had claimed to be a member of a hacker's collective working for Dutch intelligence.

After the man's arrest ended the hostage crisis at the NOS studios in Hilversum, 12 miles east of Amsterdam, footage of the dramatic arrest was then broadcast to the nation.

No-one was hurt and no shots were fired during the incident, which interrupted the NOS evening news broadcast.

Police said in a statement that the man demanded airtime and threatened that bombs would go off at several locations around the Netherlands if his demand was not met.

Wearing a black suit and tie, the man entered the studio after threatening a guard with a pistol, witnesses said. It was unclear how he passed through security, which was increased after the attacks in Paris earlier this month.

Bungled: The teenage gunman had apparently intended to speak to the country on the most popular evening news broadcast, but was led to an empty studio by a quick-thinking security guard

Surrender: 'Drop it! Drop it! And get on your knees!' armed officers shouted as they rushed into the studio. The gunman surrendered immediately and allowed himself to be handcuffed without a struggle

Footage aired on Dutch TV showed the man pacing in the studio with a black pistol behind his back.

He had intended to speak to the country on the most popular evening news broadcast, but was led to an empty studio by a quick-thinking security guard.

Nevertheless, cameras were recording as he paced back and forth in front of them. Speaking to a man off camera, the suspect said: 'The things that are going to be said (pause) those are very large world affairs. We were hired by the security service.'

He begins to grow impatient, complaining 'This is taking too long'. But shortly after, police arrived with their guns drawn. 'Drop it! Drop it! And get on your knees!' armed officers shouted.

At least five police officers then ordered him to turn around and lie down, which he did and he was arrested without a struggle.

Arrested: The suspect did not resist the police commando team and immediately surrendered his weapon

Questioning: Police said they are investigating the gunman's claims to have accomplices around Holland

The teenager - who has been named in Dutch media as Tarik Zahzah - lives in the central Dutch town of Pijnacker, near the university town Delft, officials said, declining to provide details.

They refused to comment on media reports that he was a student whose parents had recently died and that he was not on a watchlist of Islamist militants.

He was being questioned and could be charged with kidnapping, possession of a firearm and threatening people with a weapon, prosecutor Johan Bac said at a press conference.

No one was hurt, but NOS cancelled its two main nightly news broadcasts.

Police special forces swept the building for explosives and found nothing, police spokesman Christine Scholts said.

'We are currently investigating who this man is and what he wants,' she said. The police were looking into claims that he had accomplices around the country with explosives.

'He took the security guard hostage and said he wanted air time. If they didn't give it to him, he said there would be bombs in different places in the Netherlands that would explode if he didn't get time on TV,' Ms Scholts said.

The threats were reportedly also contained in a letter that the man took to the studio, a purported copy of which was aired by the RTL news channel.

'Realise that I am not on my own,' it said. 'Furthermore, eight high explosives have been planted that contain radioactive material.

'If you don't take me to studio 8 to make my broadcast, we will be forced to step into action.'

The authenticity of the letter could not be confirmed.

NOS reported on its website that the man had a silencer on the pistol and threatened a security guard, forcing him to take him upstairs to the editorial offices.

It reported that he appeared to be a student who had recently lost both parents. It also said he did not figure on security services' lists of suspected Islamist militants.

NOS produces the most widely watched television newscast in the Netherlands and is based in the main national broadcast park in Hilversum.

Alert: Security forces are seen outside the Media Park in Hilversum, Netherlands, after a gunman entered the headquarters of Dutch national broadcaster NOS and demanded time on television

After the alarm was raised police quickly surrounded the building in Hilversum and evacuated staff, according to media reports. There were no reports of any shots being fired in the building.

NOS director Jan de Jong told the broadcaster that the headquarters had beefed up security in the aftermath of the attack on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris in which 12 people were killed.

He said it was unclear how the man got through tight security in the building in the central Dutch town of Hilversum, and into the editorial offices.

The media park in Hilversum, home to many Dutch broadcasters, has been tightly guarded for years, since populist Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn was gunned down in a car park there in 2002.

While the broadcaster was off air, a screen on the NOS1 channel read 'Please be patient' in Dutch.

Its main news channel main displayed a message that read, 'In connection with circumstances, no broadcast is available at this time.'

All staff were evacuated from the building as the situation unfolded and remained outside nearly two hours later as police searched the building. NOS resumed broadcasting from a studio in The Hague.
