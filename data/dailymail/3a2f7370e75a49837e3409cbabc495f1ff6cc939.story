Gerard Deulofeu appeared to be mocking one of Cristiano Ronaldo's goal celebrations as he was filmed on Thursday.

The Barcelona forward, on loan at Everton last season, was joking around at the club's training centre with young goalkeeper Jordi Masip.

Real Madrid hitman Ronaldo's celebrations are often discussed and Deulofeu appeared to exaggerate one where he points to himself and then at the ground.

He was spoilt for choice, with other notable Ronaldo efforts including 'the claw' and his Mario Balotelli-esque topless Champions League final effort.

The pair could come up against each other next season, with new Barcelona manager Luis Enrique willing to give younger players a chance this season.

Deulofeu took his first press conference as a Barcelona player on Thursday.

'I will start at the back of the queue, I have to be realistic,' the 20-year-old said.

'We all know that the best players in the world play for Barca but I am hopeful I can earn a place in the team.

One of many: Ronaldo uses lots of different celebrations, including 'the claw' (pictured here for Portugal)

'If the boss decides to give me a chance I'll take it. I believe in myself a lot and I'm a born winner.'

Deulofeu was full of praise for the forwards he is behind in the queue for the starting line-up.

He labelled Lionel Messi the best in the word, while hailing Neymar as an amazing dribbler and someone who is 'incredible in one-on-one situations'.

There was a slight mis-step, however, as he said that he admired Luis Suarez because 'of the level of hunger he has', perhaps forgetting about the striker's ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini.
