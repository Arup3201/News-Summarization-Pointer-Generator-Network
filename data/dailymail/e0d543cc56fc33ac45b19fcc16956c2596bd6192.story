The widow of a man killed by a shark in northern NSW says she does not blame the shark for his death, and has even been for a swim near the site of the tragedy.

Paul Wilcox, 50, was mauled by a suspected great white shark at Clarkes Beach at Byron Bay on 9 September as he swam about 15 metres from the shoreline.

His wife of 26 years, Victoria, was surrounded by friends and family at a memorial service on Tuesday at Wategos Beach near where the attacked occurred.

'I want to reach out to the Byron community. I don’t blame the shark, or the town or anyone. The beach is such a health giver,' Mrs Wilcox told local newspaper, the Byron Echo.

Friends say Mrs Wilcox is heartbroken over her husband's death but she plans to keep living in Byron Bay. But she has not been able to face going back to the house the couple shared.

Mr Wilcox, who was born in the UK and worked as a corporate trainer, had moved to the beachside town with his wife about five years ago.

'Our daily ritual included a swim for Paul and a run to the lighthouse for me,' she said.

Mrs Wilcox, who was seen on the beach immediately after her husband was pulled to shore by Newcastle lawyer Mark Hickey, said she did not witness the attack.

'I came to the beach after he didn't turn up to where we had agreed to meet,' Mrs Wilcox said.

'As soon as I saw the police car on the beach, I ran towards it as I knew it was him.'

A family friend, Jodie Molloy, said a pod of dolphins jumped out of the water during Tuesday's memorial service.

'(It was) a sign telling us that his spirit lives on in the Bay, it was a very special moment,' she said.

Mrs Wilcox has already been back in the water for a swim since her husband was attacked a week ago, Ms Molloy said.

Despite the heartbreak of her husband's death, Mrs Wilcox said she wanted to stay in Byron Bay but could not go back to the house the couple shared together

'She is trying to get back into her routine - back into the healthy lifestyle that drew them to Byron Bay in the first place,' she said.

'Victoria cannot go home to their home in Rosebank and I'm seeking community support to help find her a new self-contained humble abode in the Bay and to cover funeral expenses.

'The Byron Bay vibe and community is what drew Paul and Victoria to the Bay time and time again before they chose it to be their home.'

Mr Wilcox swam in the sea near his property at Byron every day and the experts say he may have been mistaken for a seal or a large turtle by the shark due to his dark wetsuit and flippers. 

The businessman was on his regular one-kilometre swim when the shark attacked, biting into his leg.

Holidaymaker Mark Hickey spotted him in distress and paddled frantically to his aid, but Mr Wilcox bled to death in the water.

Mr Hickey said the water had darkened so much with blood he initially thought he was looking at a patch of seaweed.

Victoria and Paul married in Sydney in 1989 and moved to Byron Bay five years ago

Mr Wilcox, pictured left in 2006 and right in 1989, ran a time management and skills company through which he coached a number of high-profile company directors

He jumped on his paddle-ski and sped towards Mr Wilcox some 40 yards away, in what police called ‘an extraordinary act of bravery’.

'Then I realised he was in trouble and I had to make a decision - and that decision was to try to do what I could to help him,' he said.

'I didn't think much about the shark - I just needed to help the man. The shark had been circling and came back to him and had another go.

‘I grabbed him and got him back to the beach and tried CPR but it was too late.'

Victoria had the agonising task of identifying Mr Wilcox's body on the beach.

Mr Wilcox had joked about the danger of sharks with his family in the UK just 24 hours before he was attacked.

Mr Wilcox came to Australia in 1986 for a six 
month adventure holiday but loved the lifestyle so much he stayed.

He
 met his 50-year-old wife, a personal trainer who lived in Sydney, at a 
friend’s wedding in Australia. The couple married in Sydney in 1989 but
 decided not to have children.

The couple had moved to Byron Bay five years ago.

Mr
 Wilcox grew up in Coventry, and his parents separated when he was a 
child and both remarried.

His step-father Bryan Wilcox, 79, 
told Mail Online how he and his wife had urged him to be careful as they spoke on the 
phone from their home near Corwen, North Wales, before the fatal attack.

'I told Paul to be careful of the sun,' he said.

He made a joke and said, 'I
 always wear a wetsuit and I use a lot of sun lotion'. Then he said: 'That's not the problem, the sharks are more of a problem.'

'I
 told him he must be joking. Then he started to laugh and said, "They 
are very very rare here – I've never seen one." He had never referred to
 sharks before,' Mr Wilcox said.

Marie
 Wilcox, 74, said her son  – who took her husband's surname – had said 
he planned to go for a swim in the sea the following morning. She said: 'The last thing I said to him was: keep safe, I love you.'

Speaking
 of the couple, she said: 'It was love at first sight, they adored each 
other. They had found their paradise in Australia.'

Mr
 Wilcox, a keen swimmer since his youth, was a member of Byron Bay 
swimming club, and was in the shallows on the eastern side of the  main 
beach when he was attacked.
