A science teacher at a Baltimore Catholic boys high school has been arrested for having a sexual relationship with one of her current students.

Lynette Trotta, 33, is accused of having sexual contact with a 17-year-old student at Archbishop Curley High School, where she has taught since 2007.

Trotta, whose husband is a math teacher at the school, allegedly conducted the affair inside her car after class and even inside her classroom during school hours.

Lieutenant Eric Kowalczyk of the Baltimore City Police told CBS that the affair began in December 2013.

It came to light after a librarian at the school became aware of the relationship and reported it to the archdiocese on April 1.

The archdiocese reported the matter to police.

Trotta has been suspended from work and the librarian has also been suspended for not reporting the alleged affair immediately, instead waiting a number of weeks.

The student told police that Trotta began showing a special interest in him in November 2012. The pair began emailing and texting before the exchanges became sexual.

According to the Baltimore Sun, the student told police that Trotta would pull him out of class and spend time kissing him in her classroom.

Reverend Joseph Benicewicz, the president of Archbishop Curley, sent a letter to parents explaining the situation to parents and alumni, asking that anyone with any further information come forward.

'I as president and the entire administration do our absolute best to make sure that our teachers and staff are of high moral quality and that they embody the values on which this school is built,' Benicewicz said in the letter.

Trotta is being held on $100,000 bail.
