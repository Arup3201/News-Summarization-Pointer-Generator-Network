Conor O'Shea has branded criticism from Lawrence Dallaglio for demoting Chris Robshaw as Harlequins captain as a 'load of rubbish'.

Joe Marler will lead Quins throughout the 2014-15 season to enable Robshaw to concentrate on his duties as England skipper with the next World Cup little over a year away.

Former Red Rose and Wasps captain Dallaglio described the decision as 'strange', but O'Shea defended the change. 

Leader: Joe Marler replaces England skipper Chris Robshaw as Harlequins captain for the 2014-15 season

Born leader: Quins director of rugby Conor O'Shea says criticism of the move is 'a load of rubbish'

'I take these things with a pinch of salt,' the club's director of rugby said.

'You put a microphone under someone's mouth and they say something people want to hear and it becomes a headline.

'If you dig a little deeper, then it's a load of rubbish.

'Chris has been incredible for us and has been captain of England and Quins for the last three years and with that comes pressure.

'I've been talking to Chris about it for a year and I just felt that with the year we have coming up, this is the right time to do it.

'I want what's best for Quins and for England. This decision was made to help Chris be the best he can be for England and Quins.

'Captaincy is second nature to him and he will still be a leader.'
