A multi-million pound sports super-centre backed by Judy Murray and Colin Montgomerie could affect archaeological remains from the Jacobite Campaign, it emerged today. 

The proposed Park of Keir development promises to create jobs and includes a hotel, a tennis and golf super-centre, and 100 homes near Stirling in Central Scotland. 

A planning application for the sports club, which would be built on greenbelt land between Bridge of Allan and Dunblane, was lodged in July.

It has been publicly backed by the Lawn Tennis Assocation, the Professional Golfers Association, and Tennis Scotland. 

Local sporting clubs such as Dunblane Soccer Club also support the plan as they state there is a need for more facilities in the area.

But the Park of Keir Group, led by Judy, the mother of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, was met with opposition earlier this year when 200 residents who have objections with Stirling Council. 

Now the project, which is also backed by Scottish golf star and former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie, has been told that it will have a 'negative impact on a series of known archaeological remains' if the plans go ahead.

A series of maps and drawings of Roman archaeological sites in Scotland highlight the area where the development is planned as a route where troops passed through in the Jacobite Campaign.

In a consultation document, Murray Cook, Stirling Council's archaeologist, said: 'There are a number of existing and emerging policies relevant to this application with regard to Archaeology.

The Jacobites were the supporters of King James VII (of Scotland) and II (of England) and his heirs.

James VII and II ruled Britain from 1685 to 1689 but because he was a Roman Catholic he was replaced by his daughter Mary and her husband, the Dutch Prince William of Orange. 

Those who continued to support the exiled James  became known as ‘Jacobites’.

In 1689, the Jacobites were opposed by the Williamites, or Whigs, those Britons who supported the Protestant cause and would not tolerate a Catholic kingdom.

The first of the three main Jacobite uprisings was the 1689 rising, which was led by ‘Bonnie Dundee’, John Graham of Claverhouse, and quickly quelled. 

The second was Mar’s Rebellion, or the ‘Fifteen’, which took place between 1715-16, was provoked by the death in 1714 of the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne, and the accession of King George I. 

The third Jacobite uprising was the ‘Forty-Five’, that took place from 1745 to 1746. The 'Forty-Five' was when Charles Edward Stuart - the famed ‘Bonnie Prince Charlie’ - led a Scots army against the Hanoverian dynasty.

It is remains of this third campaign that experts said will be disturbed by the current plans for Park of Keir.

'There is no doubt that the proposed development will have a direct and negative impact on a series of known archaeological remains for example the Stirling to Crieff military road used in the Jacobite Campaign on 1745, which is likely to be associated with objects dropped by both Government and Jacobite troops.' 

The group's full proposal includes a new tennis and golf centre; a museum and visitor centre; indoor and outdoor tennis courts as well as a golf course with clubhouse and practice areas.

There are also plans to build a hotel with leisure and conference facilities and multi-user sports pitch and outdoor play area.

The super-centre will be accessed via a combination of cycle trails, footpaths and new access roads.

Mr Cook noted that he had 'no objection' to the development, but recommended that if plans go ahead, an archaeological contractor should carry out a survey in order to scan for any hidden remains.

He said that there should be a heritage trail designed around the proposed development that identified key features of interest.

Mr Cook added that should excavation be necessary, developers should fund the work.  

But, despite its findings, the report concluded that 'The development represents an opportunity to improve the management, accessibility and interpretation of the hillfort and any impact on setting would be more than compensated for by such general improvements'. 

The plans hit trouble last month when the council's principal planning officer, Claire Milne, said that the economic benefits of the scheme were outweighed by its detrimental costs to the environment.

Ms Milne reported: 'Although it is accepted [that] the tennis, golf, tourism and recreational element of this development proposal may provide a degree of social as well as economic benefit to the local area, what is proposed is essentially a private commercial venture.

'The submitted business case is not sufficiently convincing to warrant approval of the proposed housing.

'The net economic benefits of the proposed development are considerably outweighed by the significant detrimental costs to the environment and the lack of physical and social infrastructure to support the development.

Benefits: While the report identified the impact Park of Keir could have on the remains, it concluded that it also represented an opportunity to 'improve' the hillfort. Above, an artist's impression of one of the buildings

Heritage trail: A council archaeologist suggested that there should be a trail around the site that identifies key interest points relating to the Jacobite uprising of 1975. Above, a concept design of Park of Keir

'On this basis the development cannot be supported in policy terms.'

If the plans are given the green light, it will result in the building of the second hotel linked to the Murray family.

Earlier this year, Andy opened a five-star resort in Perthshire, north of the proposed Park of Keir development site.

Five-star Cromlix, which was crowned Scottish hotel after opening in April, boasts 10 bedrooms and five suites which overlook manicured grounds and tennis courts. 

Councillors will consider the Park of Keir application at a later date, and it is likely to end up with Scottish ministers making the final decision.

The Park of Keirs partners said in a statement: 'The Park of Keir partners are committed to ensuring that any development at the site is handled sensitively and this is confirmed in detail in the accompanying Environmental Statement submitted with the planning application earlier this year. 

'We remain confident that our proposed development represents sufficient benefit to the people of the local area to allow members of the planning committee to approve our application.'
