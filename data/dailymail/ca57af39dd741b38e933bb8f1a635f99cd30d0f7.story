A mentally ill North Carolina inmate held in solitary confinement for 35 days died of dehydration, an autopsy report revealed Thursday. 

Michael Anthony Kerr, 54, was found unresponsive in the back of a van on March 12 while being transported to a mental hospital. 

Officials say that prior to being driven to the mental hospital, Kerr was being held in solitary confinement -- or 'The Hole' -- at the Alexander Correctional Institution in Taylorsville.

During his confinement, Kerr was reportedly cited twice for flooding his cell.

35 Days: Kerr was reportedly held in solitary confinement for more than a month prior to his death

Investigation: Department of Public Safety secretary Frank L. Perry pledged in March to conduct a thorough investigation into Kerr's death, no details of the investigation have been made public

Alexander Correctional Institution policy allows prison staff to turn off the water to an inmate's toilet or sink for 'misuse of plumbing.' 

Authorities noted abrasions on Kerr's arms that were consistent with being restrained.

Kerr suffered from schizoaffective disorder -- a mental illness featuring symptoms of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder -- and officials say he was not receiving treatment at the time leading up to his death. 

ABC News reports that Frank L. Perry, public safety secretary, pledged to conduct a 'thorough' and 'aggressive' investigation into the death of Kerr, who had been serving a 31-year sentence as a 'habitual felon.'

The agency has yet to make public any results of the investigation. 

ABC reports that Pathologist Dr. Lauren Scott said in a medical examiner's report that she could not determine whether Kerr's death was natural, accidental, or a homicide.

Venuti said that missing key details led to lack of information led to unanswered questions about the circumstances leading to Kerr's death, including when he was last provided with food and water.

'It was not possible to make any firm conclusions regarding the inmate's nutrition and fluid intake,' Venuti said, 'and whether or not his mental health and/or external factors played a role in the dehydration.'

 Earlier this year, Kerr's sister, Brenda Liles, told the Associated Press that she and her brother had struggled with mental illness since the death of his two sons In recent years.

Liles also told the AP that she tried to contact prison officials days before her brother's death in an effort to get him help after hearing from another inmate that Kerr was in danger.

Since Kerr's death, an ACI nurse and staff psychologist resigned and a captain and four nurses have been fired by the North Carolina Department of Public Safety.

The agency failed to respond to a request filed Thursday for information regarding Kerr's punishment.

The agency reportedly said in a statement that the autopsy's findings are being reviewed and an investigation into Kerr's death is ongoing.
