A man killed his wife in self defence when she approached him in the form of an evil apparition, a court heard.

Ahmed Al-Khatib, 35, claims mother-of-three Rania Alayed, 25, appeared as a djinn - an apparition in Muslim belief - commanding him to bury her body.

Believing he was going to be killed, Al-Khatib pushed Miss Alayed, who hit her head and fell unconscious, the jury was told.

Following the djinn's orders, he took the body from his brother's flat in Salford to a grave dug between trees near to the A19 in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, the court heard.

The body of Syrian-born Miss Alayed has still not been found 10 months on from the incident on June 7 last year.

Al-Khatib claims a partial defence of diminished responsibility.

Tony Cross QC, prosecuting, said: 'The
 defendant accepts he was responsible for the death of his wife Rania 
but he insists it was not his intention to harm his wife.

'He
 had been mentally unwell at that time with paranoia manifested in 
auditory and visual hallucinations, with a djinn - an evil apparition 
speaking to the defendant.

'Immediately
 prior to the death of his wife the defendant began to see his wife in 
the form of a djinn. This vision terrified him and advanced towards him.

Police descended on a house on Knutsford Road in Gorton, Manchester, on July 4 last year where Ahmed Khatib was charged with murder following the disappearance of mother-of-three Rania Alayed

After Khatib was arrested he told psychiatrists she died after he pushed her during a row whilst 'possessed of spirit.' He claimed he pushed her, causing her to stumble, fall and bang her head, the court heard

'The
 defendant believed he was going to be killed and pushed her back. His 
wife struck her head against a mirror or a piece of furniture and she 
was rendered unconscious and then realised she was dead.

'The
 defendant will say he was acting in self defence in pushing his wife, 
the djinn, away. There had been several occasions when he had seen his 
wife as a djinn.

'He said he was commanded to bury her. He dug a grave between some trees and buried her not far from the dual carriageway.

'The prosecution do not accept that the defendant’s mental responsibility was diminished at all.'

Arthur Millwood Court, the Salford home of Ahmed Khatib's brother Muhaned, where Ahmed claims he saw the 'djinn'

He said that the defendant had been seen by a number of psychiatrists and reports were submitted about his behaviour.

Today
 Al-Khatib had to be physically restrained after he lunged to put his 
hands around the neck of an interpreter after the prosecution claimed 
facts were being 'made up'.

Yesterday proceedings were delayed when Al-Khatib began banging his head against the glass of the dock.

Manchester Crown Court was told Miss Alayed had left Al-Khatib after years of domestic violence.

On June 7 last year, he lured her to spend a weekend together without the children at the home of his 38-year-old brother Muhaned Al-Khatbi, it was said.

Her brother-in-law left the address with the children some 45 minutes 
later and shortly after her husband walked out wearing her clothing, 
including jeans and headscarf.

Ms Alayed’s body was in a suitcase 
which was later moved to Muhaned Al-Khatib’s motorhome that travelled 
towards the North East in the early hours of the next day.

The 
prosecution say the marriage was 'marred by violence' from Ahmed 
Al-Khatib and that Ms Alayed had left him after years of serious 
domestic violence.

They had fled the Middle East to 'a place of 
safety' in England and settled in the Middlesbrough area before moving 
to Manchester in 2009.

She feared for her life and had sought help 
from the Citizens Advice Bureau, the police and eventually a solicitor 
which had angered her husband’s family, the court heard.

Earlier the jury was told that 
telephone, Facebook and message services were deployed to pretend to 
others that Ms Alayed was still alive, the court heard.

Mr
 Cross said: 'They did not though fool Rania Alayed’s real friends. They
 slipped into using language she would never have used and they became 
suspicious.'

One particular 'callous and calculating' ruse was devised to make it appear as if the mother-of-three was in Turkey.

Muhaned Al-Khatib was said to have persuaded a friend to forward a text message to the victim’s father.

It read: 'My beloved father, I know you are upset by me.

'I am in Turkey. I have been here a few days.

'Ahmed has divorced me and I am going to remarry someone.

'I know you are upset with me but I am sorry.'

Denies murder: Ahmed Khatib, pictured with his arm on a horse. The 33-year-old and his brother both deny murder but admit perverting the course of justice by transporting and concealing Miss Alayed's body

The trial at Manchester Crown Court, which started yesterday, is expected to last for up to five weeks

Ahmed Al-Khatib was arrested on July 4 and made no complaint of any mental illness, the court heard.

He
 told police the relationship had been trouble free until January last 
year when his wife rang police about a row when he had taken her phone.

He said he had seen pictures of his wife in underwear.

Detectives
 were told he had not seen her since April and he had tried to contact 
her 30 times but believed her to be in Turkey or Syria.

Mr
 Cross told the jury: 'Quite plainly, ladies and gentlemen, the majority
 of these facts were lies. He knew full well. He had killed her.'

The next day Muhaned Al-Khatib told police that Miss Alayed was not alive and she was buried at the side of a layby on the A19.

He
 denied helping his brother to bury her or murder her and said he had 
not seen her body.The court heard he agreed to show police where her 
grave was but the location could not be found.

Mr
 Cross said DNA from the third defendant, Hussain Al-Khatib, was linked 
to a pair of scissors found in the motorhome - said to have been used to
 cut up the suitcase.

Ahmed Al-Khatib, from Gorton, and Muhaned Al-Khatib, of 
Salford, both deny murder but pleaded guilty to 
intending to pervert the course of justice by transporting and 
concealing the body of Ms Alayed.

A third brother, Hussain Al-Khatib, 34, of Knutsford Road, Gorton, denies the latter charge.

The trial is estimated to last up to five weeks.
