At 22, Ms Strauss was an aspiring model and a finalist in cycle eight of the Tyra Banks hosted show, But now, the 28-year-old's family says she is close to losing her battle with methamphetamine.

With Ms Strauss living on the streets, Dr. Phil her brother, Brandon, and mother, Debbie, go to her hometown with the hope of finding her. Reluctantly, she agrees to travel to Los Angeles to see Dr. Phil.

However, after she is seen physically 
resisting being placed on the Dr Phil stage, she then runs away, out 
onto the Paramount lot.

Dr. Phil follows her, and makes a point of noting: 'This is the first time in ten years I've come out here, [and it's] to talk to you.'

Ms Strauss, who called herself 'well-rounded' while on the show, also had her fair share of struggles prior to her appearance on Dr Phil.

A few episodes into the 2007 America's next Top Model season, she had to deal with a 
friend's death from an overdose.

While she decided to remain on the show, saying in an interview, 'There was never, never a question in my mind to leave 
the competition. My friend is gone and I am still here living life to 
the fullest,' she chose to dedicate her picture that week to her dead friend.

Then, that same year, she sued over the release of erotic photos taken of when she was 16.

 her', she herself could not keep away from drugs.
