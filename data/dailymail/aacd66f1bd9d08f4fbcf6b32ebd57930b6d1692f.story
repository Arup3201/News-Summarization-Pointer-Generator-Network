The line between work and play has become increasingly blurred as a new report shows that more than half of us check work emails on holiday.

Not even the dead are sacred, with one in 50 admitting to reading memos at a funeral.

Out of the 500 UK workers surveyed for GFI Software by Opinion Matters, 18 per cent use a smartphone or tablet as their primary device for checking emails.

Not even a far-flung beach is a refuge from the office, with 60 per cent of workers admitting to checking their  emails on holiday

Sergio Galindo, general manager of the Infrastructure Business Unit at GFI Software, said checking emails outside of working hours could compromise business security.

He said: ‘This kind of approach can all 
too easily breed an 'out-of-sight, out-of-mind' attitude towards email 
safety, security and backup, which is dangerous ground for any company 
to be on given the value of the data tied up in an organisation's 
mailbox.’

60% check emails on holiday2.6% have had a glance at a funeral1.5% checked when their partner was in labour6.4% sneaked a peek at a wedding4.1% looked during a school function41% check work emails at least once a day in their personal time

31.4% resist the temptation to read work emails outside of the working day18% use a smartphone or tablet as their primary device for checking emails32% turn off their smartphone while on holiday

The results showed that 23 per cent have risked company email security by connecting their device to public Wi-Fi hotspots while on holiday.

Differences in results per region were highlighted by the survey.

Workers in the North East are the fastest to respond to an email with 36.4 per cent doing so within 15 minutes of receiving an email during office hours.

They are also the most impatient, with 18.2 per cent expecting a reply inside the same time period.

In the capital, 55 per cent of workers admit to regularly checking work emails after 11pm.

Meanwhile workers in the East of the country are the most successful at balancing work and play, with just 30 per cent checking emails after 11pm.
