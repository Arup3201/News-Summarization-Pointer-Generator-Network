Argentina has unveiled a coin to commemorate the 30th anniversary of its invasion of the Falklands, inscribed with the year it claims Britain seized the islands.

The South American nation's Central Bank will put into circulation 4.9 million of the two peso coins, which bear the dates 1833 and 1982-2012.

In a statement the bank said that 1833, since when the islands have been under continuous British rule, represented the 'year of the usurpation by Great Britain'.

Rewriting history: The Argentine coin commemorates the '30th anniversary of the recovery of the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich'

Argentina claims Britain expelled a small Argentine civilian population in that year, but Britain had actually laid claim to the islands as far back as 1765 and Falklanders say it was only an illegal Argentine military garrison that was later expelled.

The Central Bank said 1982-2012 was inscribed on the coins to mark the '30th anniversary of the recovery of the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich'.

The reverse of the coin also features the crest of Unasur, the Union of South American Nations, over a map of the Falkland Islands with the two dates above and below.

On the coin's outer ring, the word 'Malvinas' - the Argentine name for the islands - is written at the head with 'Causa Regional Americana' (American Regional Cause) below.

The use of the coin to highlight Argentina's claim to sovereignty over the Falklands and its backing from other South American nations marks a further attempt by the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to stoke the controversy.

On the other side of the coin is a map of Argentina and Antarctica with the 'Malvinas' and other disputed islands in the middle with the words '2 pesos, Republica Argentina' and '2012' inscribed.

Two pesos is worth around 25 pence.

The coin was unveiled alongside a new 100 pesos note in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the death of Eva Peron, better known as Evita, the second wife of former president Juan Domingo Peron.

Argentina's invasion of the Falklands in April 1982 triggered a 74-day war which cost the lives of 255 British servicemen, 649 Argentines and three Falklands citizens.

The Falklands is to hold a referendum next year on its status as a British territory in a move designed to send a clear message to Argentina about the population's wishes.
