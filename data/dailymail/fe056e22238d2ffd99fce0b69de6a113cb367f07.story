The Mulberry handbags that provided one of the first controversies of England’s doomed 2018 World Cup bid are now under scrutiny by FIFA investigator Michael Garcia.

New York attorney Garcia, who is leading the FIFA ethics probe into the shadowy bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, is understood to have asked the FA for the receipts for the designer accessories.

The fashion bags, which cost £239 - within the bid guidelines - were given to the voting FIFA executive members on a visit to London in October 2009 as gifts for their wives. Former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner had complained that England hadn’t handed out goody bags at a Leaders in Football conference, as Australia and Qatar had done.

Ironically Warner, who has since resigned from all football positions in disgrace following his involvement in the cash-for-votes scandal surrounding Mohamed bin Hammam’s aborted bid for the FIFA presidency, returned his wife Maureen’s Mulberry handbag a month later. He said he felt ‘derided, betrayed and embarrassed in its presence’. The FA did not comment on Monday.

The bizarre scattergun approach to Michael Garcia’s investigation into the World Cup bids is demonstrated by him not interviewing England 2018 ambassador David Dein, one of football’s great global networkers. He addressed the Caribbean Football Union dinner in Trinidad in 2010, for which England 2018 picked up a £35,000 tab that is under investigation by Garcia. Even the lighting came to £1,009 on the itemised bill sent to the FA.

TalkSPORT are trying to defuse the simmering dispute between their lead pundit Stan Collymore and South Atlantic veterans hugely upset over Collymore’s tweet suggesting Britain had stolen the Falkland Islands.

TalkSPORT managing director Calum Macauley is meeting protest organiser Dougie Brimson tomorrow with the station making clear Collymore’s tweet was a private one and did not reflect the views of the station.

The BBC inquest into Phil Neville’s desperate debut as a monotone co-commentator during the England v Italy game seems to have been as detailed as the team’s post-mortem. 

Neville is understood to have had long conversations with his bosses and media trainers about what went wrong with his delivery tone following earlier successful trial runs. 

However, Neville, used to the ups and downs of professional football, will be given his scheduled group games to improve before the Beeb make their verdict on him with their last-16 planning.

WAGs at arm’s length

England have scheduled no time so far this week for the players to spend with the WAGs who have made the trip to Brazil. In contrast, Robin van Persie was basking in the glory of his two-goal display in Holland’s dismantling of Spain by having breakfast with his wife beside the pool in the Copacabana Palace Hotel, FIFA’s HQ, while their children played in the water.

Meanwhile, Wayne Rooney’s advisers are taking no chances with the security of Coleen Rooney, who arrived in Brazil on Monday night. The British consulate in Rio were involved in finding the best equipped personnel to guard Coleen and sons Kai and Klay.

The FA’s no-expense-spared preparation for major tournaments has proved far more consistent than the poor results on the pitch. And once again England have been first in the queue preparing for Euro 2016. The plan is to present various accommodation and training-pitch options around France to manager Roy Hodgson after the World Cup.

The serious row between Nike and Adidas over the former using their England supply contract to parade the players in leisurewear with minimal FA branding isn’t the only clothing dispute to have arisen on the World Cup trip.

Nike were also miffed that their branded ‘anthem jackets’ weren’t worn by the England team for either of the friendlies in Miami because it was deemed too hot for the extra clothing.
