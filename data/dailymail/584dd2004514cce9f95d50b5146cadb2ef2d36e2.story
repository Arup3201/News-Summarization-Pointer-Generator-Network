Police have named the nine-year-old twins who were found unresponsive in a hotel pool in St Louis, Missouri Saturday afternoon.

Laron and Derrone Snelson were found Saturday afternoon at the Pear Tree Inn on Market Street in downtown St. Louis.

Laron Snelson was pronounced dead and his twin brother Derrone is still in a critical, unstable condition at Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center.

Hotel horror: Twin boys were found unresponsive in the pool at this St Louis hotel

The Child Abuse Unit is investigating, which is standard procedure when a child dies.

The
two young boys were found just before 5pm Saturday afternoon while 
swimming with family.

Authorities yesterday refused to release the boys' identities but named Laron and Derrone Snelson today.

Several people ran towards the pool area, which is just off the lobby of the downtown Pear Tree Inn, witnesses told local media.

A hotel guest told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that he ran to the pool area and performed CPR on one of the young boys.

‘Someone asked if anyone knew CPR,' Kevin Shelton told the paper, adding that a hotel employee was trying to revive the other boy, ‘I was just praying and helping.’

The twins’ 14-year-old brother was inconsolable as his brothers were taken away in an ambulance, Shelton added.
