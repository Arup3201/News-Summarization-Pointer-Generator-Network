A council which banned apostrophes from the names of new streets because it did not want to baffle residents with punctuation has decided to reverse the decision.

The leader of Mid Devon Council said he would be recommending to the ruling cabinet that the policy was changed so that apostrophes would again be used.

Councillor Peter Hare-Scott said he did not find it acceptable that incorrect grammar was being used on the council's street signs.

Change: Mid Devon Council has reversed its decision to ban apostrophes from the names of new streets. It means apostrophes such as the one seen on an avenue in Devon will also be placed on new signs

It followed a storm of protest last week when the policy to ban apostrophes was revealed.

'The convention not to use apostrophes when naming new streets has been in place since long before this administration took over,' councillor Hare-Scott  said.

'Personally I'm not happy about using English that's incorrect and don't find this acceptable.

'We are reviewing the situation and I shall be recommending to cabinet on March 28 that they amend the policy so that street names may indeed in future have apostrophes.'

The proposed naming and numbering policy document states streets should not be given names 'that may be considered or construed as obscene or racist', while those 'that may be open to re-interpretation by graffiti or shortening of the name shall be avoided'.

Baffling: Residents slammed Mid Devon Council for issuing the bizarre guidance

It adds: 'In order to avoid causing offence either by inclusion or exclusion, no street shall be named after any living person.

'All punctuation, including apostrophes, shall be avoided.'

Last year book retailer Waterstones removed the punctuation from its brand name.
