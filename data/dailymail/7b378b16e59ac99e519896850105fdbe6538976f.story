The Ezell family are already looking forward to next Christmas, when Santa should only have to make one stop.

Owen and Emmett were born in July joined from the chest to the belly button, with shared intestines and a liver.

But after successful surgery in August, the pair were able to spend their first Christmas in the world as two separate people - and parents David and Jenni would never have missed the celebration regardless.

Dressing the boys up in adorable Santa suits, the couple shared from the Medical City Children's Hospital in Dallas, Texas, on their blog, while speaking of their excitement for Christmas 2014.

Their sons are due for another bout of surgery early next year and, if successful, could be home by summer.

The Ezell family have a lot to be thankful for this Christmas after their sons, Owen and Emmett, were born conjoined in July but successfully separated in August

Following another bout of surgery early next year, Parents Jenni and David Ezell are hoping to take their boys Owen and Emmett home by summer 2014

Jenni Ezell and her husband Daze, from Guthrie, Oklahoma, were told during a routine sonogram earlier this year that their babies were joined at the abdomen

Next Christmas is going to be bedlam,' David Ezell told NBC News with a smile.

'It's going to be madness with all those little ones running around.'

'It's going to be great though. Bedlam in a good way.'

Owen is currently 16 lbs., while Emmett is 15 lbs.

Medical City Children's Hospital says the boys are alert, smiling and interacting with their family and Medical City staff.

'We're getting these rumblings that the boys are getting better and it's not long before we get to bring them home and you know, it's all worth it,' David said.

'At this point we're as glad as we can be to have gone through it because now we're here.'

These comments are at complete odds with the situation they were in back in March, after finding out while pregnant their twins shared vital organs only had a five per cent chance of living a healthy life if separated.

The heartbroken parents considered a termination.

We wanted to save them from the pain and hurt that they would feel,' Mr Ezell said at the time.

However
 the couple soon had a change of heart after a doctor convinced them 
that their boys, who shared a liver and intestines, had a fighting 
chance. 

A specialist at 
Medical City Dallas renewed their faith, telling them: 'These boys have a
 really good chance. This is not your only option.'

Mrs
 Ezell gave birth to conjoined boys Emmett and Owen on July 15. Doctors 
advised that separation surgery was possible but risky - out of eight 
similar operations, only once did both twins survive.

The couple, who have two 
other sons, moved to Dallas for the boys' medical care and were able to say goodbye before the boys were taken into surgery.

'As a mother, I hope I never have to 
experience a moment like that again,' Mrs Ezell wrote in her 'Ezell 
Twins' blog.

On August 24, an 11-hour operation 
successfully separated the boys. At a news conference following the 
surgery, Mrs Ezell said: 'I have two babies â€¦ two separate babies!'

Her husband added: 'A couple of pretty good looking babies, Iâ€™d say.'

Owen and Emmett,  have remained at Medical City Children's Hospital in Dallas since they were born and will do so for several more months.

They will need further surgeries in the future; after they are two, the boys will require 'skin expanders' for their wounds.

Another operation will require surgeons to pull abdominal muscles into place, which should leave them with only a neat line of a scar.

After this, if the parents wish, they can opt for the boys to have a third surgery to create a belly button for each of them.

Roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.

Around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 per cent survive only one day. The survival rate is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, the Center reported.

The condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest, sharing organs.

Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, experts say. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time.

After separation, most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines.

Although risky, there are many stories of successful separations.

Most recently, Utah twins Kendra and Maliyah Herrin, who were born sharing an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs, just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four. Their family said the girls, who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics, are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been.
