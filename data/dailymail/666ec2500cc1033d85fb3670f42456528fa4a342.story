His garden is a 'no-go area' and trips to the bathroom must be as quick as possible, for Ted Grayson lives in constant fear of being smashed into by a passing vehicle whenever he's home.

Mr Grayson's 18th Century cottage has been hit more than 40 times in the last 14 years and on four occasions since the New Year.

The 57-year-old farmer is single, which is probably a good thing because he claims the property in the blackspot village of Nether Haugh, nr Rotherham, South Yorkshire, is 'too dangerous for a wife and family.'

And Mr Grayson is not alone.

Other villagers have suffered from numerous accidents on the narrow B6089 road, which has a 30mph limit through Nether Haugh.

There have been 14 logged since the start of 2014 and residents have formed a group to campaign for a 20mph limit and safety measures, such as speed cameras, to be installed.

Cars have regularly ploughed through hedges into fields, lamp posts demolished, cyclists hit and walls smashed up. Both village bus stops have also been wrecked several times.

Unfortunately for Mr Grayson, his farmhouse home is on a bend at the bottom of the hill and he has suffered more than anyone else.

Mr Grayson said: 'Motorists are regularly hitting my house, or glancing off it as they drive through the village.

'I've had minor knocks and more disastrous accidents, such as an artic jack-knifing and taking out the end of my house.

'One time my brother was sat eating breakfast when a motorcyclist came crashing through the kitchen window, his bike stayed outside, he landed inside and ended up sharing some breakfast.'

Mr Grayson said he can't get home insurance cover for the damage and has to claim from the motorists' policy every time.

Cars regularly plough through hedges into fields, lamp posts have been demolished, cyclists hit and walls smashed up while both village bus stops have been wrecked several times

'I only had my kitchen wall repaired for the umpteenth time last year, and there have been small repairs to three holes in my garden wall this year.

'Every bit of my home which fronts up to the road has been smashed into several times, and the whole house has been hit more than 40 times since I moved in 14 years ago.

'My bathroom lies right above the kitchen and I make my trips to the toilet as short and I dare not sit out in my garden.'

Another resident David Lee, a car salesman, has had his home smashed into three times so far this year. He fears someone could be killed if nothing is done.

Yet another crashed car in the village of Nether Haugh, South Yorkshire, where residents, including farmer Ted Grayson, are calling for a new 20mph speed limit and safety cameras to be installed

'It's dangerous for anyone walking on the pavement. We have spoken to the council about putting in speed cameras and they won't do it because it doesn't meet their criteria.

'It's silly waiting for someone to lose their life before installing a speed camera. It's the wrong way around.' Retired electrician Steve Chaloner, 60, said: 'I daren't even take my dogs for a walk on the pavement.

'I've lost count of the number of bumps and crashes we've had in Nether Haugh, but I'd be surprised if there's not another village in England that has had so many accidents.'

Rotherham Council said it had already installed warning signs and reduced the speed limit from 60mph to 40mph on the approach to the village.

Nigel Davey, Engineer for Rotherham Borough Council, said the condition of the carriageway would be re-assessed soon.

He promised to 'monitor the situation' and listen to residents' concerns.
