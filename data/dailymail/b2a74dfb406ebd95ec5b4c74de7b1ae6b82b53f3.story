Johnny Manziel blew off some steam as he spent his Memorial Day weekend partying with bikini clad beauties in Las Vegas.

Taking some well-earned time away from the Cleveland Browns, the 22nd pick in the first round of the draft attended a UFC event and partied with adoring fans and stunning ladies - as he lived up to his Johnny Football persona.

Showering fellow party-goers in champagne, Manziel, 21, was joined by New England Patriot's tight end Rob Gronkowski and LA-based superstar DJ, Diplo, as they spent their Sunday at a glamorous pool party.

Manziel even unleashed his trademark 'show me the money' hand gesture while posing with his fans at the Encore Beach Club at the Wynn in Las Vegas before heading to ringside seats at UFC 173 according to Nofilterphotography.com.

Posting their poolside revelry to Instagram and Twitter, Manziel and co seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their holiday weekend.

Later that evening, the rookie quarterback and Diplo paid a visit to Surrender nightclub at Encore just after midnight - spraying champagne everywhere.

Giving the Browns a taste of what they can expect from their high-profile draft, Cleveland Browns General Manager Ray Farmer said he was looking forward to seeing Manziel play.

'He's almost like the Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth throwback -- he's a guy's guy,' Farmer told 92.3 The Fan on Wednesday.

'When you see him he's having fun, he's partying, he's doing his thing. I think people are attracted to the fact that not only does he make plays and is a really good athlete...he's a really good player, but he lives life.

'I think the fact that he lives life is what brings people circling back to who Johnny Football really is.'

But Farmer also said that Manziel will have to know his limits.

For his part, Manziel has said that he will need to tone down his Johnny Football persona.

'For me, I know I need to put all my time right now into maintaining my life in football and trying to be as good of a quarterback as possible,' he said according to Cleveland.Com 

'Everything else is extra and really -- there's no time for it right now. I'm very committed to expanding my knowledge of the game and getting better as a quarterback. That's my focus right now.

'There's definitely a benefit to allowing Johnny to be Johnny,'' he said. 'But he's got to understand the pro game and be able to apply that to having success in this league.'

Talking about the spotlight that follows him wherever he goes, Manziel said that that it is something he has become used to.

'I'm used to that,' he said in the press conference.

'It's been my life for a while now. For me, the spotlight, expectations, everything that comes along with that, I was used to that at A&M, and I think that directly helps me and what I'm getting into moving forward.

'The NFL and the way the league is and how big of a deal it is, it's bigger than I'm sure I know. I'll find out, but I think that I've been prepared by the past. It'll help me moving forward.'
