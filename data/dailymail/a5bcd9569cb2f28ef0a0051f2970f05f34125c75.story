Roberto Martinez hailed Ross Barkley as 'exceptional' after the England midfielder's man-of-the-match performance inspired Everton to victory.

Barkley set Everton on their way to a 3-1 win over Queens Park Rangers with a stunning goal and showed why his manager believes he can one day become England' s answer to Michael Ballack.

With four central midfielders injured or suspended, Martinez dropped Barkley into a deeper role and he was rewarded with his most mature performance of the campaign. He linked superbly with the equally impressive Muhamed Besic.

'The futures that these two players have is immense,' said Martinez. 

'I thought Ross was a joy to watch, the way he finished his goal was exceptional. It is as good as you are going to get.

'The work he has put in to training recently has been very impressive and he deserved that goal for wanting to take responsibility. It was a lesson in how a midfielder can execute a strike with such quality.'

When asked if Barkley drew comparisons to former Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack his answer was immediate. 

'Yes, absolutely. How quickly he takes concepts on, his power and technical ability makes him special.

'He has played in the no 10 role, but in a deeper position he makes good decisions on the ball. It's good for him at his age to experiment in different roles.' 

Barkley added: 'We've got the three points today and that's going to give us a bit of confidence so we're going to take every game as it comes and hopefully put things right on the pitch. 

'Anywhere on the pitch, I enjoy playing, but to get the three points and to get the three goals against a QPR side that played well as well, it was great.

'Wherever I am on the pitch I try to affect the game. Because Gareth (Barry) was out, I was playing deeper and I enjoyed that.'
