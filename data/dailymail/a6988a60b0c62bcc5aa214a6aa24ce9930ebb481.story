Alan Pardew thinks Siem de Jong will be the new Teddy Sheringham of the Premier League.

De Jong completed his £6million move to Newcastle in July, having scored 75 times in five seasons for the Dutch side despite playing in a withdrawn role, much like Sheringham.

And Pardew, who worked with the England No 10 at West Ham, says his new man is a class act in the same mould.

‘He is a terrific player,’ said Pardew. ‘I have been lucky enough to have managed great players — and he can be one of the best. He reminds me of Teddy Sheringham, the way he conducts a game and conducts himself.’

During an open training session at St James’ Park, Pardew, unable to talk to the written press under orders from owner Mike Ashley, told the crowd: ‘We hope to give you a season you will remember for a long time. I hope to see more goals this year.

‘We have more options and if a game is not going well we can change it. We have offensive options on the bench.’

Newcastle take on champions Manchester City at St James’ Park on Sunday and Pardew knows the pressure will be on.

‘This place will be full up,’ he said. ‘The expectation will be there as it always is at Newcastle. We have to put on a show. But I think we will give City a really, really good game.’

Pointless! Hatem Ben Arfa has cancelled a meeting with supporters as doubts remain over his future

Midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa was excluded from the session, and cancelled plans to meet supporters on Tuesday.

The 27-year-old was banished to the reserves by Pardew earlier in the summer.

Meanwhile, Sportsmail understands Ashley’s move to scrap the ticket allowance for backroom staff includes Pardew and his players.

Pardew’s No 2 John Carver and ex-England winger Steve Stone were among those now being told to pay for tickets.

The initiative applies to all employees, meaning players and management are no longer entitled to free seats for friends and family at home games.
