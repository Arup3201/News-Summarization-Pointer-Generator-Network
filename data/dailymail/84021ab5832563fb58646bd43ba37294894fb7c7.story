A pregnant woman who lost her baby after her boyfriend allegedly tricked her into taking an abortion-inducing drug feared for her safety and sought the court's protection in the days after the killing.

Remee Lee, 26, was rushed to hospital with bleeding after John Andrew Welden - her boyfriend and the son of a fertility doctor - allegedly gave her a bottle of pills which he claimed were antibiotics.

After she took a pill, her seven-week-old fetus died and three days later, Lee sought protection against Welden, 28, in Hillsborough Circuit Court, near their homes in Lutz, Florida.

In her April 1 petition, she listed his weapons as 'guns, knives, brass knuckles' and 'medicine', theÂ Tampa Bay Times reported.

'I am afraid that he took measures to kill/abort/murder my unborn child, potentially killing me by switching my medicine,' she wrote. 'And now that he is facing investigation he will continue to cause me more emotional and physical harm.'

In one section of the petition, she was asked whether she had a child with the man - and unable to provide a definitive answer in the light of the tragedy, she simply ticked 'n/a'.

Welden faces a first-degree murder charge and a life in prison for the alleged killing.

Lee was around six weeks pregnant when a scan at Welden's father's clinic in Lutz, Florida confirmed that she was pregnant - but she said Welden was not happy with the news.

'I was never going to do anything but go full term with it, and he didn't want me to,' Lee, 26, told ABC Action News.

But after the scan, Welden, who is working towards a degree in sports medicine, called her to say that she had a bacterial infection and needed to take Amoxycillin, an antibiotic, three times a day.

He gave her a bottle of pills, which she called 'his weapon of choice'.

Lee told ABC Action News that she did not call Dr
Welden to confirm that she had an infection because she trusted her 
boyfriend and believed they had a future together.

In fact, Andrew Welden had forged his father's signature on a prescription for Cytotec - an abortion-inducing drug - and re-labeled the bottle as Amoxycillin, according to a federal prosecutor.

Lee took a pill on her way to work but was hospitalized with bleeding and abdominal pains, the Tampa Bay Times reported. She lost the baby in hospital.

'Weapon of choice': Welden allegedly gave her this bottle of pills after switching the labels

She was carrying the bottle of pills and doctors saw that they were not antibiotics.

'What did you give me, Andrew?' she asked Welden, according to the prosecutor.

Welden admitted the switch in a 
confession recorded by Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office detectives, 
the prosecutor said. A drugstore surveillance camera captured him buying
Cytotec, the Times reported.

Lee filed a lawsuit in state court on Wednesday claiming she suffered battery and emotional distress, while the government has begun its criminal case in federal court.

A federal grand jury indicted him on Tuesday with product tampering and first-degree murder.

In federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Muldrow called the terminated pregnancy 'senseless', the Times reported.

'He had no reason to kill the baby, his baby,' Muldrow said. 'She had a name for the baby she wanted to have.'

The paper noted that while a six-week-old fetus would not be considered viable in state court, federal law does not acknowledge the distinction.

If someone kills an unborn child while committing a federal crime, it is considered murder, Tampa lawyer Todd Foster, a former assistant U.S. Attorney and FBI agent, said.

Welden was denied bail after he was deemed a flight risk, but his defense attorney David Weisbrod said Welden had no prior criminal record and said the act was out of character for his client.

Welden's father, a board certified 
obstetrician and gynecologist who works with infertile couples wishing 
to become pregnant, has not been accused of any crime.

Andrew Welden worked as an office manager at the Lutz office of Premiere Weight Loss Center, another family business.

His
bio on its website says that he studied nutrition and exercise 
physiology at the University of Mississippi and the University of 
Memphis, and is working toward a degree in sports medicine.
