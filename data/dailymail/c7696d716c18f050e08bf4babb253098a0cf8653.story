The BBC deputy director of news today became the latest casualty of the Jimmy Savile Newsnight scandal after he resigned over the fallout from problems with the flagship investigative programme.

Acting director-general Tim Davie said he had accepted Stephen Mitchell's resignation this morning with ‘great sadness’. However it soon became clear that still nobody has been sacked over the affair.

It came as former Sky News executive Nick Pollard released his review into the decision to drop a report into Jimmy Savile's sexual abuse, saying it was ‘flawed’ and plunged the BBC into ‘chaos’.

Newsnight editor Peter Rippon and his 
deputy Liz Gibbons - editor on the night of the disastrous documentary which led to 
Lord McAlpine being wrongly named as a paedophile - are being replaced and have not been working on the 
programme for a number of weeks due to the fallout.

Meanwhile,
Helen Boaden, the corporation's director of news, will return to her 
post tomorrow after having stepped aside while the Pollard review was 
carried out.

Mr Rippon initially stepped aside from Newsnight over the shelved Savile programme.

Mr Davie insisted that Mr Mitchell would not be receiving a pay-off, and said the BBC is replacing the senior editorial team for Newsnight with the appointment of a new editor and deputy editor.

Mr Mitchell said in a statement: 'It is with great sadness that I have decided to retire from the BBC after more than 38 years’ service of which I am very proud and which I have found greatly enjoyable.

'Given the strain over the past month since being told to stand aside from the job I loved, having endured the Pollard review process and now having read its criticisms, I have decided that it is in my interests and those of the BBC that I bring my career to a dignified end.

'Whilst
I feel vindicated that the review has found that I put no undue 
pressure on Peter Rippon, I disagree with the remainder of Mr Pollard's 
criticisms in relation to me.

'I am grateful for all the support I have received from friends and colleagues around the BBC. I request that both my and my family's privacy be respected at this time.'

BBC broadcaster Andrew Marr defended former boss Mr Mitchell, telling BBC Radio 4’s The World At One he was a 'good guy'.

He said: 'He was always one of the most 
cautious, straight down the line, old-fashioned traditional voices in 
the BBC.

'And, clearly, there were lots of mistakes made, but any sense, 
and Pollard, of course, has pushed this to one side, that there would be
improper pressure applied by Steve Mitchell on a programme about 
paedophilia or anything else - utterly, utterly out of court, completely
impossible and against his character.'

Coming back: Helen Boaden is due to return to her role as director of news at the Corporation, it was revealed

The BBC said it would tighten up its 
procedures for difficult stories and there will be improved guidance and
training for journalists about how and when material should be handed 
to police.

'Whilst I feel vindicated that the review has found that I put no undue pressure on Peter Rippon, I disagree with the remainder of Mr Pollard's criticisms in relation to me'

Meanwhile Helen Boaden is due to return to her role as director of news, despite being criticised in the Pollard report.

Ms Boaden's attempt to alert Mr Entwistle to potential problems posed by the story during an industry lunch was 'too casual' and she is criticised for not taking 'greater responsibility' as the crisis grew.

Adrian Van Klaveren is also being replaced as Radio 5 Live controller by Jonathan Wall, who is a commissioning editor.

But Mr Van Klaveren will not be leaving the BBC and is set to move to a new role, which will be announced next year. Mr Rippon and Ms Gibbons are also moving to other jobs at the Corporation.

The McAlpine probe led to the resignation of director-general George Entwistle after just 54 days in the job, and three BBC employees have been disciplined. One is Ms Gibbons, another is Mr Van Klaveren and the third is unknown.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the report raises serious questions about the BBC's editorial and management issues.

Helen Boaden, director, BBC NewsThe BBC veteran started her career in radio and rose through the ranks to become head of news at the corporation. An award-winning reporter, she is ultimately responsible for shows such as Today, Newsnight, Question Time and Panorama.

Peter Rippon, Newsnight editor

A BBC lifer, Mr Rippon has worked on a string of high-profile shows and took over at Newsnight in 2008. He faced criticism for falling audiences and has seen some high-profile figures leave the show. He stood aside after his explanation in a blog about why the investigation into Jimmy Savile was pulled was criticised for inaccuracies and had to be corrected. He was moved to another role in the BBC.

Stephen Mitchell, deputy director of BBC News

A newspaper reporter before he joined the BBC, Mr Mitchell has mainly worked in radio and has been deputy director since 2008. He oversaw the blog written by Peter Rippon which was subsequently corrected by the BBC, and resigned this morning.

George Entwistle, former BBC director general

Mr Entwistle joined the BBC as a trainee in 1989 after a short career in magazine journalism and went on to hold jobs including editor of Newsnight, head of current affairs and head of television. His stint in the top job lasted 54 days and he spent virtually his entire tenure trying to deal with the fall-out from the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal. The final nail in his coffin was the disclosure that Newsnight wrongly implicated Lord McAlpine, a former Tory party treasurer, in a child abuse scandal in north Wales in the 1970s and 1980s.

Adrian Van Klaveren, former controller of BBC Radio 5 LiveA former BBC trainee, Mr Van Klaveren has now left his role at 5 Live for another position in the organisation. He signed off on the decision to show the film which led to false allegations that former Tory party treasurer Lord McAlpine is a paedophile. It has now been announced that he will move to a non-news role.
