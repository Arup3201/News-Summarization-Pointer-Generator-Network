A father reported his own son to the police after he spent nearly £3,000 on Xbox games using the family business' credit card.

Ian Holmes discovered his son Daniel, 20, had made dozens of payments to Microsoft's Xbox Live network.

Holmes Jnr had permission to use the card for the family business as he had an investment in it - but continued to spend his father's money on gaming points and online subscriptions.   

Daniel Holmes, 20, made 77 payments to Microsoft's Xbox Live network, which totalled £2,800

‘Microsoft Points’ are an online currency that allows players to unlock new features in their favourite games - without having to enter a password. 

Holmes Jnr made 77 payments to Xbox live, which came to £2,400. With interest this totalled £2,800, North Devon Magistrates' heard on Friday. 

The court heard how the fraud went unnoticed throughout 2013 until Mr Holmes - who did not own an Xbox - noticed the payments on his credit card statement.

Lyndsey Baker, prosecuting, said: 'He confronted his son and he admitted it but his father knew he could not pay it.'

Tim Hook, defending, said Holmes Jnr had made an investment in his father's business and had obtained the credit card details legitimately.

The case reached North Devon Magistrates' Court because Mr Holmes realised his son could not re-pay him

Mr Hook said: 'The defendant continued to use it, on each occasion buying Xbox games and carrying on a form of gambling which increased into a relatively substantial sum.

'His father asked him to repay it. He said he was extremely annoyed and "could hit him"'.

Mr Hook told the court that the case had come before them because Mr Holmes realised his son was unable to repay the debt at the required rate of £200 a month, as he was unemployed.

He added: 'It is sad this domestic matter was put to the police.'

Probation officer Mel Wright, said: 'It seemed he got hooked on what he was doing, and he got deeper and deeper.'

Holmes Jnr, of Ilfracombe, Devon, was ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work and pay compensation of £2,097.88. 

Presiding magistrate Michael Buckley said: 'This is a very sad case.'
