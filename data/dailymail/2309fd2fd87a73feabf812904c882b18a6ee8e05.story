A five-year-old schoolgirl has been hailed a hero after she made a tearful 999 call to save her mother's life when she collapsed in the family home.

Sienna Adderley's mother Katie, 32, was getting her ready for school when she collapsed and started shaking in her kitchen in Rugby, Warwickshire.

With no one else around Sienna picked up the phone and called the emergency services - remaining calm enough through her sobs to tell the operator her mother's symptoms.

Collected: Sienna, pictured at home with her mother, remained calm enough through her sobs to tell the operator her mother's symptoms. She was too small to open the front door to emergency service workers

The call, which has been released by emergency services with the permission of Sienna's family, captures the moment she came to her mother's aid. 

'I can't wake her up,' she told the operator. 'She is collapsed on the floor and now she is shaking. She is lying in the kitchen'.

Because Sienna was too small to open the door, emergency services pinpointed her mother's address before breaking in and treating her during the incident last Thursday.

Sienna, who attends Eastlands Primary School in Rugby, said: 'My mummy was in the kitchen and I was watching CBeebies when she collapsed.

'It was very scary but my dad told me if she got poorly when I wasn't there then I should call 999.

'I told them where I lived and had to look after my brother too. I was crying but tried not to be frightened.

'When the police came a lady policewoman took me upstairs and we played with my toys in my room while they made her better.

Brave: Sienna said her father had told her to phone 999 if her mother 'got poorly' when he wasn't there

'Everybody is saying I'm very brave, which is very nice. I'm glad I helped my mummy because I love her lots.' 

Mrs Adderley, a former playschool supervisor who also has a two-year-old son Riley with partner Carl Green, 33, was treated at the scene and said she had her daughter to thank.

She taught Sienna how to dial 999 because she had suffered similar collapses in the past. Doctors initially thought she might have epilepsy, but are still attempting to diagnose her condition.

'My husband and I have always encouraged Sienna to be involved if I'm ill so she would not be worried and would know what to do,' she said. 

'Thank goodness Sienna was here to help me. You don't know what might happen to you if you don't get the treatment you need.

'Usually Sienna would call her daddy but she had no answer, so she decided to ring 999. She has never had to ring them before although we did show her what to do in the past.

'She sounds very distressed but by the end of call she sounded very confident and she was pretty calm considering the circumstances.

'She was very brave and I am so proud of her. Not only was she trying to see to me, she had her little brother to look after as well. She is our little hero.'

Mrs Adderley added the community has pulled together to raise £900 for a new front door.

It was the first time Sienna had called 999. Police have described her as a 'superstar' and are planning to present the brave youngster with a certificate at a school assembly.

PC James Graham, who attended the incident, added: 'Police officers from Rugby Response and Safer Neighbourhoods Team attended an incident reported by a 999 call.

'The caller was five-year-old Sienna reporting that her mum was ill.

'That in itself is amazing but she also stayed on the line while checking her mum and looking after her younger brother.

'All the attending officers thought she was fantastic and a superstar.

'She just took it all in her stride. She deserves recognition for her actions and her parents are rightly proud of her.

'Sienna used the 999 service, exactly how it is meant to be used, and is a shining example to others.

'We would encourage other parents to teach their children from an early age, how and when they should call 999, as this incident show's how vital it can be should an emergency arise.'  

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called by police to Brodie Close in Rugby to treat a woman following a medical incident.

'She received treatment by paramedics and recovered whilst at home.

'We learned from our police colleagues that the patients five year old daughter had raised the alarm by calling 999 and we would like to congratulate her on her brave actions.

'All parents are asked to teach their children about calling 999 in an emergency as one day it may just save someone's life.'
