Stuart McCall has admitted to enduring sleepless nights before realising he no longer had the answers to halt Motherwell’s slide in form.

The 50-year-old released an emotional open letter to supporters on the Motherwell website, reflecting on both the remarkable achievements of his four-year spell at Fir Park and the thinking behind his decision to step down.

McCall resigned as manager on Sunday evening, 48 hours after his side suffered a fifth successive defeat with a 2-1 loss at St Johnstone.

The former Scotland midfielder feared his own despondency at being unable to turn results around could have a further negative impact on the squad.

That led him to the conclusion it was best to step aside, with assistant manager Kenny Black in caretaker charge for Friday’s visit of Dundee United while the process of appointing a replacement begins.

‘I struggled to sleep after Friday’s game with St Johnstone then woke up again during the night, Saturday into Sunday, thinking about the Dundee United game and I just couldn’t come up with any answers,’ said McCall.

‘I felt that with the international break coming up, now would be a good time to step aside to allow the club time.

‘I have a hope that with a fresh voice and maybe some new ideas, it will give the players that little boost they need. I felt that if I didn’t have the same hunger or desire, if I was deflated, then the players would sense that and that’s not what they, or the club, needs at this point.

‘This season has been difficult and when you become apprehensive about the next game, that’s your body’s way of telling you that maybe things have come to an end.

‘Both as a player and manager, you should work all week and really look forward to matches, but if you have that negativity in your head, it’s difficult and I don’t want that to make our situation any worse. I care too much about the place and the people who work here.’

While his last few months in charge were painful, McCall’s tenure will go down in Motherwell’s history as one of great success. Back-to-back runners-up finishes in the league were joined by continental adventures in the Champions League and Europa League, as well as an appearance in the 2011 Scottish Cup Final.

‘It’s fair to say that the last 24 hours or so have been incredibly difficult and emotional for me personally,’ he said. ‘However, it has also given me time to reflect on what has been four wonderful years.

‘Seeing what getting to a national final meant to the fans, and also the town itself, is something that will live with me forever.

‘I think back to the night we beat Hearts to qualify for the Champions League, then the atmosphere at Fir Park for that game against Panathinaikos. For a lot of our players, that was the highlight of their career, playing at that level.

‘I remember coming back from 2-0 down at Easter Road to win and no one will ever forget that game at Pittodrie (on the last day of last season). That will go down as one of the best days I’ve ever had in football.

‘I just hope the amount of highs cancel out some of the disappointments when people look back at what we’ve achieved here.’

McCall paid glowing tribute to his players, backroom team, club directors, office staff and supporters for their ‘invaluable’ assistance.

‘I would ask you all to rally around the club and the players in the next few weeks and months,’ he added.

‘Nothing would give me more pleasure if I am back up the road next May with my claret and amber scarf, with the team having picked up in the league, watching Motherwell at the Scottish Cup Final once again.’
