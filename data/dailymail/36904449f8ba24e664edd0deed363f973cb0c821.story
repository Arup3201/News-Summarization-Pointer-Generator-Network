Convicted: Emil Metodiev was allowed into the UK despite having a string of convictions for burglary

A Bulgarian who burgled a family’s home only nine days after arriving in Britain is a violent drug dealer who had been freed by police in exchange for informing on other crooks, it emerged yesterday.

Emil Metodiev, 32, was caught red-handed fleeing from a house in Essex with jewellery, cash and war medals.

Following his conviction last week, it can be revealed that the career criminal has an appalling record for violent robbery, burglary and drug dealing in his homeland, with convictions stretching back 15 years.

Despite this, he was repeatedly released back on to the streets and was free to come to Britain after Bulgarian police struck a deal to recruit him as an informant.

Last night campaigners said the farcical case outlined the need to retain visa controls on Bulgarians and Romanians, which are due to lapse on January 1.

A senior police source in Bulgaria told the Mail: ‘Emil Paraskevov Metodiev was acquitted of charges of dealing heroin despite being caught red-handed because he benefited from a deal with police to give evidence against conspirators higher up the chain.

‘He was later arrested for burglary and singled out at an ID parade by the man he held at knifepoint. But the state prosecutor ordered that the case was dropped and he walked free. Then his family gave him money to buy a train ticket to London.’

Known by the nickname ‘Zhuzhkata’, which means ‘Buzz’ in English, Metodiev is notorious in the town of Radomir, in western Bulgaria, where he was born into a large Roma family.

One neighbour recalled: ‘The last time I saw him, he was driving around in a fast car, showing off. He was always in trouble with the police and spent years in prison.’

He is also well known to police in the neighbouring mining town of Pernik. A local police source said: ‘His first conviction for drug dealing was when he was 18. Since then he has been convicted many times of robbery and burglary as well as drugs.’ Metodiev has been convicted of selling drugs in other cities including the capital Sofia.

In September 2009 he was arrested with seven consignments of heroin. But he was released after serving only three months on remand when he struck a deal with police to give evidence against high-ranking members of the criminal network. In April 2011 he allegedly broke into a family home in Pernik.

The victim, Slavi Krakov, 21, said: ‘I woke up at 4am and saw the thief. He wanted money and when I said I didn’t have any he pulled out a knife and slashed me across the head. I thought he was going to kill me.’

Police arrested Metodiev but he was released after the state prosecutor dropped the case. On October 22 this year he arrived in the UK on a train from Sofia.

Nine days later Metodiev was caught after stealing a handbag, cash, war medals, mobile phones and jewellery from the Toms family’s home in Southend.

Denise Toms, 55, woke to find  the downstairs of her home  being ransacked. Her husband Trevor, 62, chased the thief into the street, while their son Adam, 19, who was only wearing underpants, ran after him, leaping over fences into neighbouring gardens. Police were called and found Metodiev hiding in bushes clutching the  stolen goods.

Last week, at Basildon Crown Court, Metodiev was jailed for 16 months after admitting burglary. He will be deported at the end of his sentence.

Prosecutor Richard Kelly said: ‘He had only been in the UK for a few days and had no independent means of income. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the reason he came to the UK was to commit crime.’

Metodiev was allowed to enter the UK because EU law states that previous criminal convictions do not constitute automatic grounds for restricting the right to move freely within the bloc.

Tory MP Philip Hollobone said: ‘This is a farcical situation. It shows what you get when you open your borders to all and sundry.

‘This case indicates that we have a wave of criminals coming our way, that police forces in this country do not know enough about the individuals that come here and that Romanian and Bulgarian authorities need to tell the UK police about the backgrounds of these criminals.’

The Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior said: ‘We cannot give any information about this case because Metodiev may be involved with an on-going investigation.’
