A headband with built in earphones could help us sleep more soundly and easily, it has been claimed.

The SleepPhones are a fabric band with earphones built in - and its makers claim you can even use them without waking a partner sleeping next to you.

Current versions have a wire to connect to a phone, but a wireless version, set go go on sale in April, has just won a prestigious awards at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Sleeping soundly: The headbands have small headphones built in, and there are versions for sleeping and running

The firm also makes a version of the headband for runners

'Being able to sleep soundly is crucial to feeling well overall, and SleepPhones help by playing relaxing audio, drowning out noises, and establishing a positive bedtime routine,' said Wei-Shin Lai, one of the inventors of the headphones.

The firm began selling the product in 2007, when Ms Lai was working as a doctor.

'In 2007, I had trouble falling back to sleep after patient phone calls late at night as a family doctor.

'My husband suggested that I listen to something to take my mind off of patient concerns.

'Since I didn't want to disturb my husband while he slept, I needed headphones or ear buds I could wear in bed.

'But there was nothing comfortable on the market so I came up with stuffing speakers inside a headband.'

The firm is now set to introduce its first wireless version, selling for £50 ($80) in April.

'There’s a version of our product for 
sports, a version for sleep, and now a wireless version that eliminates 
cords entirely by playing back media from any Bluetooth-enabled device,'
said Lai.

The current version has a wire so it can be plugged into an iPod or bedside alarm , but the next version will be wireless the firm said today.
