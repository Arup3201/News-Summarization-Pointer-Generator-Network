The manager of the Samoan rugby team is having to raid his piggy bank - after he was fined 100 sows by his home village for misbehaving at the recent World Cup.

Mathew Vaea was ordered to give leaders in Leauva'a the animals for tarnishing  his chiefly title of 'tuala' by drinking regularly and treating the campaign in New Zealand like a holiday.

Leauva'a chief Vaifale Iose said Vaea's actions, which he claimed led to the team failing to reach the quarter finals, had brought his position into disrepute.

He told the Samoa Observer newspaper: 'The title of tuala received bad publicity in the media because tuala Mathew failed to perform some of his duties as the manager for the Manu Samoa.'

Rather than hand the animals over to the village, Vaea has paid a fine of 2,000 Samoan tala (£535) and made a formal apology to village elders.

The revelations of Vaea's conduct came from Samoan captain Mahonri Schwalger.

Last month he provided a damning assessment of team officials' behaviour during the tournament, in a report to Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi.

He said Vaea 'did not want to be there' and would disappear for days at a time, accusing him of drinking regularly when he was present and treating the campaign like a holiday.

The monetary value of the fine may be considered staggering in Samoa.

But it is dwarfed in comparison to the £25,000 penalty handed to England's Mike Tindall who also behaved inappropriately during the competition.

The husband of the Queen's grand-daughter was also dropped from the national team for his role in the England team’s infamous night out in New Zealand on September 11.

Smarting over their poor performance in the opening match, the players downed cut-price shots at a ‘dwarf-tossing’ competition while the newly married Tindall drunkenly cavorted with a glamorous former girlfriend.

That raucous night and the recriminations that followed overshadowed the competition and set the tone for England’s appallingly poor show.

Vaea, meanwhile, still does not know whether he will continue as manager of the Samoan team.

The country's Rugby Union has advertised for a new team manager, head coach and two assistants since the doomed tournament.

But he has not been formally fired. Tuilaepa, who is also chairman of the Samoa Rugby Union (SRU), has also ordered a full audit of World Cup funds, the release of which is scheduled for next month.
