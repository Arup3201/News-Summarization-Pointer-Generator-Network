After being spotted canoodling at the beach volleyball, Britain’s golden couple of cycling Laura Trott and Jason Kenny were only too happy to confirm their fledgling romance yesterday.

Laura, 20, told her 66,000 Twitter followers: ‘So, yes, it is out there, me and @JasonKenny107 are dating.

‘Been a little while now, just didn’t want the distraction before the games x.’

Kenny, 24, said to be ‘extremely shy 
and private’, was said to be stunned when a photograph of himself 
kissing his new girlfriend was beamed across the world.

They could hardly complain, however, 
after choosing to embrace for the first time in public while sitting 
next to two of the most photographed men in the world: Prince Harry and 
David Beckham.

It was at an intensive pre-games 
training camp in South Wales in June that Laura and Kenny became serious
about one another. Their burgeoning romance certainly proved no 
distraction as they went on to win two gold medals each.

However, the couple’s passionate kiss 
will not have gone down well with Laura’s ex-boyfriend and fellow 
British cyclist, 20-year-old Sam Harrison, who was not in the Olympic 
cycling team.

Laura is understood to have broken up with her former teenage sweetheart in mid-June while she was still at the training camp.

Writing on Twitter at the time, 
Welshman Harrison said: ‘Would just like to giv a big shout out to my 
mates, don’t know how special they are till s*** hits the fan. Big love 
people xx’

At their home in Bolton, Jason Kenny’s
parents said he and Laura were just an ‘ordinary young couple who just 
happened to have a few gold medals between them’.

His mother, Lorraine said: ‘Her relationship with Sam had come to an end and she started seeing Jason a few weeks later.

‘She is a lovely, talented young lady and she has been around to the house a few times and has always been very nice.’

Her husband Michael said Kenny and 
Laura had been ‘incredibly disciplined for the last few months and even 
years and they haven’t had a drink for a year or so’.

He added: ‘Now 
they just want to soak up the atmosphere and they are letting their 
hair down a little because very soon it will be back to business again 
as they start their cycling again.

‘He is an ordinary lovely boy with an ordinary lovely girlfriend.’

Mr Kenny said he had received an 
excited text from his son the night before saying, ‘David Beckham has 
just bought me a sandwich!’

Meanwhile in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, 
Laura’s home had become a shrine to her Olympic success, bedecked in 
flags and pictures of her triumphs.

She and Harrison, who lived in the 
same block in Manchester while training at the city’s velodrome, dated 
for more than a year.

He failed to congratulate his ex-girlfriend after 
her two Olympic golds. Instead, apparently sarcastically, he retweeted 
someone else’s message saying: ‘Laura Trott – what a genuinely lovely 
girl. Its like we all just had a little sister win. LOLLLLLLL.’

After Laura’s new romance became 
public on Wednesday night, he tweeted: ‘As for me iv got nothing to say 
on the matter, so ur wasting ur time.’ But later he wrote: ‘Might write a
book on all of this.’
