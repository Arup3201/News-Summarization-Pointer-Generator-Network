A director whose CV includes racy TV shows such as Hollyoaks and Footballers’ Wives has been appointed editor of The Archers.

Sean O’Connor will take over BBC Radio 4’s farming soap opera next month, replacing Vanessa Whitburn who steps down after 22 years in charge.

The appointment is likely to raise eyebrows among the show’s notoriously sensitive listeners, who have previously raised concerns that show was being ‘sexed up’.

The BBC said it was seeking a ‘resilient’ replacement for Miss Whitburn, someone who knew how to ‘learn from your mistakes and say sorry when you’ve got it wrong’.

Miss Whitburn earlier this year was forced to deny she had deliberately sensationalised life in Ambridge to compete with gritty TV soaps such as EastEnders.

The show - which was originally billed as ‘an everyday story of country folk’ - is traditionally associated with the quieter aspects of rural life, rather than the sex and violence associated with urban dramas.

It was established in May 1950 and is the world’s longest-running radio soap.

Miss Whitburn was grilled by fans after a string of dramatic storylines including an arson attack dubbed ‘Farmageddon’ and a torrid extra-marital affair.

The death of Nigel Pargetter, who fell off a roof in 2011, caused outrage among some fans, despite resulting in a record audience.

Writing in the Radio Times in May, one fan asked: ‘The Archers goes over the top with accidents and violent gangs. Are you trying to compete with soaps like East Enders?’

Miss Whitburn replied: ‘Before my time as editor Grace was burnt to death, Tom Forrest was in court for killing a poacher and there was a diamond smuggler in the village, so we’re possibly less melodramatic than we were then!

‘I don’t think The Archers has to compete with TV soaps. 

‘Strong storylines such as Lilian’s affair with Paul should be balanced with gentler stories of community life – the fete and the pantomime, or how they’re going to raise money to repair the church organ.’

Sean O¿Connor also directed dramatic television soap, Hollyoaks

Mr O’Connor will take up his Archers role in mid-September and will be based at BBC Birmingham, where The Archers is recorded. 

It currently attracts 4.7 million listeners each week.

Mr O’Connor, who previously worked on The Archers in the 1990s, has also been involved with EastEnders and Hollyoaks, as well the ITV show Footballers’ Wives and the Channel 5 drama Family Affairs.

He said: ‘I’m honoured to take the reins of our national epic drama and to build on the extraordinary achievements of Vanessa Whitburn who dedicated much of her career to this unique cultural institution.’

Gwyneth Williams, controller of Radio 4, said: ‘The Archers is our most loved and longstanding daily drama and the job of editor carries great responsibility and trust.

‘Sean is steeped in storytelling and will be working with the immensely talented Archers team in Birmingham so I am extremely pleased to be welcoming him back to Ambridge.’

An online advertisement for the role specified the new editor would have to be confident, brave and resilient. 

It said the role required candidates to be good at ‘learning from your mistakes and saying sorry when you got it wrong’.

One skill explicitly requested was ‘resilience’, with the ‘ability to maintain personal effectiveness by managing emotions in the face of pressure, setbacks or when dealing with provocative situations’.
