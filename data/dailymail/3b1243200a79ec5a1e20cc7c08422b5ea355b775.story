A Manhattan restaurant believes it may be the basis of one America's most famous paintings.

In fact, West Village's Classic's Cafe owners are so certain of the connection they're changing the name from Classic's Cafe to Nighthawks. 

Manager Alex Vigor said he was first tipped to the spot's place in art history when a Chicago man named Mark came in and told him the restaurant was the model for Edward Hopper's Nighthawks.

The 1942 painting portrays the customers at a city coffee shop through the window one dark night

'I was star-struck for a second,' Vigor told The New York Post.

The painting's setting has never been given. 

Owner Fiko Uslu started to research the claim and now believes it to be true.

'I am sure [this is the setting for ‘Nighthawks’],' he says.

He bases the claim on the similarity between the building and the one in the painting which both feature triangular spaces and large windows.

Vigor says the bar inside has been there since the 1940s. 

However he has not been able to find out what the building housed in the early 40s, confirming only that the space has hosed a funeral parlor, restaurants, and even a porn store. 

But historians aren't convinced.

Many researchers believe the painting is based on a spot on Mulry Square. 

Hopper passed away in 1967 and left only the clue that the painting 'was suggested by a restaurant on Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet.'

Classic Cafe is on Greenwich Street, not Avenue. 

'If you go to Greenwhich Avenue, there's nothing there,' Vigor argues. 

It's also possible that Hopper only imagined the diner rather than paint an existing structure.

One person who's seen all the evidence he needs to see is the restaurant's landlord. He's already raising the rent based on the connection.
