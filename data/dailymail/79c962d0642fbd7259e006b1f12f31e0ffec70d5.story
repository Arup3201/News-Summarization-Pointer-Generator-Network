More than four in ten children in some areas were yesterday denied their preferred secondary school amid mounting competition for places.

Tens of thousands of ten and 11-year-olds found they had  missed out as allocations were announced by councils across the country.

Many areas reported a rise in the number of applicants and a corresponding decline in the number of pupils being assigned their first choice schools.

Thousands of 10 and 11-year-olds across the country face discovering they have failed to get into the school of their choice today as top secondary schools say they are more oversubscribe than ever

The allocations to more than half a million families are likely to see a surge in appeals.

Law firm Maxwell Gillott warned the system can be a ‘minefield’ for parents.

Research by the Mail shows a booming population in many towns and cities is fuelling rising demand for secondary places.

In
 London, where the demand for secondary school places rose 5 per cent in
 a year, 31 per cent of youngsters were rejected by their first choice 
school – up slightly on last year.

Fierce competition: As pressure on the best school grows, families are turning to secret tutoring for children

Education minister David Laws said 'sharp-elbowed parents' who push to get their children into the best schools should not be criticised

This rose to 42 per cent in the boroughs of Westminster and Hammersmith & Fulham and 41 per cent in Wandsworth.

In
 Bristol, the population of secondary school age youngsters shot up 8 
per cent, leaving 23 per cent of children without their first choice 
school – compared with 18 per cent in 2013.

‘The
 rise in reception pupil numbers seen in 2007/08 is starting to filter 
through to secondary schools.

Michael Gove has chosen a state secondary school for his daughter.

Beatrice, ten, has secured a place at Grey Coat Hospital School, a Church of England girls’ comprehensive in Westminster – her first choice.

Mr Gove is believed to be the first Tory Education Secretary to choose a state secondary for his child.

The minister and his wife, Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, are said to be ‘delighted’.

Founded in 1698, Grey Coat Hospital School specialises in languages and is typically at least five times oversubscribed for places.

'There has also been general population 
growth in the area,’ said a spokesman.

In
 Birmingham, where applications also rose, 30 per cent were rejected by 
their first choice – up from 26 per cent.

Buckinghamshire, meanwhile, 
was unable to offer places to 22 per cent.

Around one in seven youngsters are expected to miss out on first choice schools.

Under
 the admissions system, parents list their school  preferences.

They are
 then allocated places according to the schools’ admissions criteria, 
which are mainly based on a family’s proximity.

Other
 factors can include random lotteries or ability banding – measures 
aimed at preventing middle-class parents playing the system by moving 
into catchment areas.

Banding involves all pupils being tested, with a 
set number of bright, average and low ability children admitted.

Competition
 is particularly intense for places at grammar and faith schools, as 
well as flagship free schools and academies, which are funded by the 
taxpayer but free from local government interference.

Tiffin
 School in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, saw 1,863 boys sitting the 
11-plus test, competing for 160 places.

The West London Free School, in Hammersmith, had nearly 10 applicants for each of its 120 places

The West London Free School, 
founded by journalist Toby Young, had 1,124 applications for 120 places.

Matt
 Richards, senior director of www.schoolappeals.com, said: ‘Most people 
are happy with a good school, they don’t necessarily want an outstanding
 school, but if there isn’t one in your area then you have a problem.

‘There are areas where schools are still failing.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Every parent deserves the chance to send their child to a good school.

‘The number of children in failing secondary schools has already fallen by a quarter of a million since 2010.’

Parents apply to a local authority for a place for their child each year, and those wanting a place at a secondary school for September 2014 had to apply by 31 October last year.

Depending on where they live, families will either find out today or tomorrow where their child has been allocated a place.

The schools set their own admissions criteria and admissions are dealt with by the local authority.

For example, faith schools give preference to children who practise the religion of the school, while others may prioritise those with siblings already at the school or those who do well in an entrance exam.

For some, study alone will not be enough - and their parents will have to appeal the school's decision (file image)

Parents may list up to a certain number of schools in order of preference on their application form - in London boroughs with larger numbers of schools that can mean up to six schools, while in other areas they may be allowed to list a smaller number - for example, parents in Bristol can list a maximum of three.

Unlike with primary schools, where catchment areas are all-important and house prices go up as a result, where you live is not usually as important a factor in most secondary applications.

There is no guarantee that children will be offered a place at their first or even third choice school - some will be offered a place at a school they did not apply to and have no wish to go to.

There is a deadline date of 17 March (in most local authority areas) for parents to respond to the offer they are given, either to accept the school place offered or to appeal a decision or place a child on a waiting list.  Places become available at schools when parents decide to send their child to a private school, look elsewhere for schools or to home-educate their children instead. 

Parents who have appealed a school's decision not to offer their child a place will have their appeal heard by an independent panel.  They will first check your child meets all the school's admissions criteria, and should come back to you with a decision within a week.
