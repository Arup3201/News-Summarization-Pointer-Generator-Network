A North Carolina family is searching for answers and demanding justice after an 18-year-old boy was shot to death Sunday afternoon by police.

The family of Keith Vidal, 18, of Boiling Springs Lakes, called police for help calming him down during a schizophrenic episode, an officer burst through the door and instead killed him in front of his horrified family.

Keith Vidal had a screwdriver and was threatening to fight his mother, police had already subdued when the killing occurred, the parents said during a Monday afternoon press conference.

Mentally ill: Keith Vidal suffered from schizophrenia and was having an episode when his family called 911

Devastated: Keith Vidal's grieving family gathered Monday for a press conference outside the office of the District Attorney

‘See this kid? This is my son,’ said mother Mary Vidal
while struggling to hold up a picture of the boy hugging a GUMBY mascot, according to WWAY. ‘This
is my flesh and blood that they murdered.’

Officials said during the press conference that
officers from three separate agencies responded following the lunchtime 911
call.

‘We called 911 and asked for assistance to help us
get him to the emergency room so that he could get proper treatment without
hurting himself,’ Mary Vidal added, according to Port City Daily.

The 90-pound boy was initially subdued by two
officers and only became upset when a third officer arrived, stepfather Mark
Wilsey said, according to WBTW.

He had been tased multiple times, the situation was
under control, but the Southport Police Department officer said ‘we don’t have
time for this’ and shot the boy to death while two officers held him down, Mr
Wilsey continued, according to WECT.

The officer shot the boy to death less than a minute after arriving on the scene, according to an incident report cited by WECT.

In tears: Mother Marie Vidal cried through much of the press conference

Greatly missed: Many friends and family took to Facebook to post their condolences and vent their shock over the teen's sudden death

‘There was no reason to shoot this kid,’ Mr Wilsey
said. ‘They killed my son in cold blood. We called for help and they killed my
son.’

A Southport Police spokesperson attending the press
conference declined to say which officer fired the shot, but announced that
detective Byron Vassey has been placed on leave.

The boy had only a small screwdriver in his hand,
it wasn’t big enough to hurt anyone, the family explained.

He had only turned 18-year-old last month.

‘Where is the justice, why did they shoot my son?,’
his devastated mother asked. ‘This is what's wrong with our mental health
system.’

Authorities declined to say much about the
incident, citing an ongoing investigation, but the boy’s friends posted to his
Facebook page mourning the tragic death.

Dead too soon: Keith Vidal had only celebrated his 18th birthday last month

Awful: This ambulance backed up to the Vidal family's home Sunday afternoon, presumably to take the dead boy from his home since no other injuries were reported

‘Keith man I can't believe you're gone we grew up
together dude I wish it didn't end up like this man you were so young,’ a
friend wrote. ‘I known you ever since the third grade we were best friends rest
easy man I'm gonna miss you RIP bro.’

‘Your death will not be in vain, justice will
served...I wish I could talk to you right now man,’ said another. ‘I keep
messaging you but Facebook isn't letting me know you ‘seen’ my messages...and
your phone just goes to voicemail.’

A relative lamenting over both his death and that
of a young cousin that recently died.

‘Thank you all for your kind words. His family
thanks you,’ the family member wrote. ‘And to my baby cousin, Brittany is
waiting for you baby boy. I love you.'
