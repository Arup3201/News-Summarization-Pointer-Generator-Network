A Crufts trophy winner who was permanently banned from keeping dogs after inspectors found more than 90 animals living in 'despicable conditions' has moved to Scotland where she will be able to own pets again.

Wendy Hutcheson, 62, who clinched second place in the yearling bitch category at Crufts in 2007 with an American cocker spaniel, kept animals in squalor at Audenshaw Dogs and Cats home near Manchester.

She was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the needs of her animals and was also handed a lifetime ban on keeping animals in England and Wales following a court case in October 2010.

Wendy Hutcheson, 62, was  banned from keeping animals after she kept more than 90 pets in squalid conditions - but she has now  moved to Scotland where she is able to keep pets due to a legal loophole

But Ms Hutcheson could now dodge the ban because of a legal loophole which means the prohibition order was not extended to Scotland.

The woman - who now uses the name Boyle - has already been reported to the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) by concerned dog lovers who claims she is seen with the dog on a daily basis.

A spokesman for the SSPCA confirmed it had investigated the claims but is satisfied that the dog is owned by Ms Hutcheson's relative.

But a spokesman for the RSPCA, which successfully applied for the ban, said Ms Hutcheson would not be flouting the ban by keeping an animal because it does not apply in Scotland.

They said: 'Provision was made during the formation of the Animal Welfare Act under section 46 that banning orders would cover Scotland, as well as England and Wales.

'However, this section was never implemented at the time the Act was passed, and so that means the ban does not apply to Scotland.'

This is one of the neglected dogs found at the pets' home in Manchester which was owned by the former Crufts trophy winner

When inspectors arrived at Ms Hutcheson's property, the RSPCA seized 63 dogs, 25 cats, two rabbits and two birds. More than a third of the dogs needed to be sedated to be 'de-matted'.

In one case the matting accounted for more than a quarter of the dog's original weight. Each dog took two veterinary nurses an average of three hours to de-mat.

Many had breathing problems caused by the 'overpowering' stench. One dog's eye was so badly infected it had to be removed – another lost 26 teeth. 

Most of the cats had ear mites and fleas, and two had feline Aids, the RSPCA said. 

Animals were emaciated and their coats were caked with urine and faeces from being kept in cramped cages and pens which had not been cleaned for 'weeks if not months'. 

RSPCA inspector Vicki McDonald said after the case: 'I've never seen as many animals living in such horrendous conditions in all my time working for the RSPCA.

'I hope the sentence will ensure no further animals suffer because of Ms Hutcheson.' 

Hutcheson now lives in a quiet part of Inverness a few hundred yards from her elderly and frail stepmother, Marion Calder.

Eye witnesses have seen her with a poodle in her car, going in and out of her house and her relative's property.

There is also a dogbed in the back of her blue Ford Ka and various dog and cat ornaments on her doorstep. 

She refused to comment on the lifetime ban or even confirm there was one in place.

Inspectors found animals emaciated, while their coats were caked with urine and faeces from being kept in cramped cages which the court heard had not been cleaned for 'weeks if not months'

At first, she also denied she had a dog, but then said: 'That is my stepmother's dog.' 

But one eye-witness and dog lover Jodie Foster said: 'I am visiting my mother on a daily basis and see this woman almost every day, going from her house to her stepmum's house with the dog.

'She stays a little while and then leaves with the dog.

'She can't be going to the vet every day. There is no doubt in my mind she is keeping the dog.

'This has been happening for around six months now.

'What is the point of a lifetime ban if she is still allowed to be near animals.'  

Scottish SPCA Chief Inspector Iain Allan said: 'We have received complaints relating to a woman residing in Inverness who is allegedly breaching a ban on owning animals which was imposed in England.

'After investigating it is our understanding that the dog does not belong to her.

'The woman advised she has been transporting the dog to and from the vets for her mother as she is unable to, and we have confirmed this with the vet.

'We are satisfied the dog is being well looked after and have no concerns at this stage. We will continue to monitor the situation.'
