Police have revealed the driver of a Toyota van fell asleep at the wheel and allegedly swerved into oncoming traffic this morning.

The 37-year-old woman was driving south over the Sydney Harbour Bridge which witnesses say crossed into a northbound lane and crashed into another vehicle.

This resulted in a major car accident on the Bridge and caused chaos amongst commuters this morning, with traffic stretching back to Sydney's city centre.

The five-vehicle accident occurred just after 6.45am, closing all northbound lanes plus two of the five southbound lanes on the bridge.

A NSW police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the driver of the Toyota van was a 37-year-old woman.

All lanes of the bridge have reopened after the multi-vehicle crash.

Emergency crews cleared the accident by 8am but all roads approaching the CBD were affected causing peak-hour chaos for commuters.

Motorists were urged to take the ferry or train.

Two people were hurt in the accident and have been taken to hospital, an ambulance spokesman said.
