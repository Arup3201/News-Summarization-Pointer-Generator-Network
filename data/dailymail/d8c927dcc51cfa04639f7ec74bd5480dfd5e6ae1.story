This is the dramatic moment passengers on board a United Airlines flight tackled a young man to the ground after he shouted 'Jihad, Jihad' and threatened to hijack the aircraft.

Flight 1074 to Denver, Colorado had to return to its departure airport in Dulles, Washington last night following a 'disturbance on board' and was met by law enforcement officials at the gate.

Shocking video emerged online showing a young man with a bloodied face being pinned to the floor of the Boeing 737 by several passengers while frantically apologising and shouting in apparent fear as a police officer identifies himself and says he will be removed from the plane.

Investigators said they found no weapons either on the man's person or hidden elsewhere on the plane, adding that nobody was injured in the 'disturbance'.

Video  of the young man being subdued was later posted on Reddit, where some individuals claimed to have been among the 33 passengers and six crew on board the Denver-bound plane.

Footage on the incident shows a brown-haired man in his 20s or early 30s on the floor of the aircraft with several cuts and bruises on his face.

During the clip, which is understood to have been taken after the plane had safely landed, a police officer attempts to calm the man down while he frantically shouts and apologises.

'One held his feet and the other one kind of laid on top of him and then the flight attendants went and got some plastic restraints for his arms,' Donna Tellam, a passenger, told ABC news. 'At one point when his head was down he said there were jihadists in the cargo hold and he did say jihad a couple times.' 

United Flight 1074 returned to Dulles at around 10:40pm after a 'disturbance onboard,' said Kimberly Gibbs, a spokesman for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. 

The passenger who was removed was 'transported to a local hospital for evaluation,' she added. 

Flight 1074 had been scheduled to depart Dulles at 10.30pm local time, suggesting it had not been in the air for very long by the time the incident occured. 

Gibbs said that by about 12:45 am the plane was on its way to Denver. The flight has now been rescheduled for this morning, she added.

United Airlines officials plan to accommodate the remaining travelers to Denver this morning, spokesman Luke Punzenberger said.
