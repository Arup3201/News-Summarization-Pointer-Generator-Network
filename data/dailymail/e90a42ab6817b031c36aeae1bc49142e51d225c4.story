Despite the obvious delight in finding his long-lost cat Freya, George Osborne must have had some concerns about letting her loose on Downing Street.

Ever since David Cameron replaced Gordon Brown as Prime Minister, there has only been one feline ruling the roost on the famous street.

Larry the cat - the Prime Minister's pet - was often spotted by famous dignitaries, reporters and photographers hunting for prey.

Turf war: When Freya was returned to George Osborne, there would no doubt have been some concerns as to how she would get on with Larry, the Prime Minister's cat

But a few weeks ago, after George Osborne's long lost cat Freya was found safe and well - Larry's world turned upside down.

No longer was he the only Downing Street cat, which must have led to concerns about a turf war between the two pets.

But if these latest pictures are anything to go by, it seems the Chancellor has little to worry about.

Freya was pictured yesterday prowling the famous street and getting used to her new surroundings, clearly unafraid of upsetting Larry.

Chancellor George Osborne and his family had assumed Freya had vanished for ever up until recently.

Tabby Freya was just a few months old when she went missing from the Osbornes’ Notting Hill home three years ago.

Mr Osborne, wife Frances and their two young children Luke and Liberty searched the streets of West London and put up ‘lost’ posters, but to no avail.

Nice surprise: The Chancellor and his family had given up hope of finding Freya after she went missing three years ago

They gave up hope long before moving into Downing Street last year, assuming the cat had got lost – or worse, been run over.

So they transferred their affections to the family budgie, Gibson, named after RAF Dambusters hero Guy Gibson, and two goldfish.

But two weeks ago, Frances, an author, received a phone call telling her Freya was alive and well.

She had been living as a stray in a garden a few streets away from the Osbornes’ Notting Hill house, lovingly fed and looked after by a neighbour who had not seen the posters.

Freya, looking particularly well-nourished, was reunited with the Osbornes after a visit to a vet revealed a microchip beneath its skin bearing Mrs Osborne’s phone number.

A few days later, Freya, looking fit and healthy, was installed in Downing Street.

The Osbornes live in the flat above No 10, which they moved into more than a year after the 2010 Election, while the Camerons live above No 11.

Before Freya was let loose in the garden, she was introduced to Larry, the Camerons’ cat.

A Treasury spokesman said recently: ‘She is settling in nicely and getting on well with family, staff and Larry.’
