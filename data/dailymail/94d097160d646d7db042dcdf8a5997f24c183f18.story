Diesel soared to a record £1.50 a litre yesterday as Chancellor George Osborne made it clear that he cannot afford fuel duty cuts in next month's Budget because the country has 'run out of money'.

The price was spotted at a Shell garage on the M6 near Coventry, with average diesel prices now standing at 143.61p and petrol at 135.39p.

The cost of filling up has almost doubled since the fuel protests of 2000, and experts predict further increases because of instability in the Middle East.

Soaring prices: Fuel prices pass the 150 mark at Corley Service Station, M6 near Coventry

Slashing prices: The discount offered by the supermarket giant is the biggest ever in the UK and will be welcome news for drivers

Campaign group Fair Fuel UK said it 
planned a mass lobby of Parliament to combat what it calls an 'absolute 
crisis' hitting families and businesses.

But Mr Osborne signalled he will not 
be able to repeat fuel-duty freezes or cuts, having already spent 
billions to keep fuel duty 6p lower than it would otherwise have been.

The Chancellor said the 'British 
government has run out of money' and that 'all the money was spent in 
the good years'. The days of 'unlimited' resources for the state were 
gone for good.

Despite forecasts that he will beat 
his deficit reduction targets for this year by as much as £10billion, 
the Chancellor said there was no room for tax cuts in next month's 
Budget.

Tory MPs are urging Mr Osborne to meet
 the party's pre-election pledge to introduce a 'fair fuel stabiliser' 
to help cash-strapped motorists.

Instead of implementing real reform of
 the tax system – so fuel duty goes down when oil prices go up – the 
Chancellor slapped a supplementary tax charge on oil and gas production 
in the North Sea to help keep prices at the pumps lower.

Before the election, the Tories hailed
 the idea of a stabiliser as a classic example of 'fixing the roof when 
the sun is shining', which would mean the Government saved money in the 
good times to help in the bad.

Currently, fuel duty is planned to 
rise every year by at least the rate of inflation, regardless of what 
happens to the price of oil. In addition, the other tax levied on fuel, 
VAT, is charged at the standard rate. So as the price of fuel rises, the
 amount of VAT charged also rises.

Mr Osborne said yesterday he had already taken expensive steps to ease the pain of rising petrol and diesel prices.

'Fuel duty is 6p lower than it 
otherwise would have been,' he said. 'I have shown willingness to 
respond to international fuel increases and have taken action this year 
to tackle fuel duty rises, which were planned by the last Labour 
government.'

It is estimated that the price of 
diesel and petrol at the pump has risen by 25 per cent and 20 per cent 
respectively over the past two years.

Mr Osborne cut fuel duty by 1p a litre
 in last year's Budget and announced in his autumn statement that a 
scheduled 3p rise would be postponed until August. He said his changes 
will save each family £144 a year.

Road rage: Soaring oil prices and a planned rise in fuel duty could lead to protests like the 'Go Slow' demonstration of last May

The rising cost of crude oil is the key factor behind the soaring price of petrol.

The biggest influence on prices at present are:

The price of diesel in the UK rose to an all-time high this month as speculators drove up crude oil prices and refineries failed to keep up with British demand

A YouGov poll yesterday revealed that 
58 per cent of adults think they are spending more on fuel than a few 
years ago. Campaign group Fair Fuel UK plans to confront MPs on March 7,
 and is due to hold talks with Treasury Minister Chloe Smith tomorrow.

Spokesman Peter Carroll said: 'This is
 an absolute crisis. Enough is enough. The current fuel prices are 
killing the economy and stunting growth.

'The Government has to cut fuel duty to create jobs and stimulate growth to start getting the deficit down.'

Supermarket giant Morrisons has 
prompted a price war by slashing 15p off a litre of petrol for anyone 
spending £60 in its stores, the largest discount ever offered in the UK.

John Woodcock, Labour transport 
spokesman, said: 'George Osborne needs to take action in his Budget. A 
temporary cut in VAT, which is part of Labour's five-point plan for jobs
 and growth, would mean an immediate drop in fuel prices and make a real
 difference to families.'
