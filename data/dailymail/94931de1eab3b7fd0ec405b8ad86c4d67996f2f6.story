The stunning wife of the billionaire Aga Khan’s son Prince Hussain has confirmed their divorce after snapping up a $2.2 million Manhattan apartment to start a new life, MailOnline can reveal.

Princess Khaliya Khan, 36, bought the property in her maiden name, Kristin White, just weeks before her ex-husband’s elder brother Prince Rahim Aga Khan celebrated his wedding to American supermodel Kendra Spears.

Princess Khaliya, a New York-born blonde, married Prince Hussain, 39, in the fairtytale setting of the Chateau of Chantilly in September 2006. She adopted the name Khaliya upon converting to Islam for her marriage.

The couple met when they were both were studying at New York’s Columbia University, from where they graduated with masters degrees.

Held at the 14th-century French chateau which was used as a backdrop for the James Bond film A View To A Kill, the lavish ceremony made a five-page spread in Hello! Magazine with the photographs supplied by the groom’s father, racehorse owner the Aga Khan, who is now said to be worth in excess of $9billion.

A private ceremony was followed by a ball for family and friends at the Aga Khan’s lavish estate, Aiglemont, in Gouviex, France. This was followed by a civil marriage ceremony.

In 2011, the Daily Mail’s Richard Kay reported there was trouble in the marriage and that the couple were parting ways – but neither Prince Hussain nor Princess Khailya ever publicly confirmed the report and it is as yet unknown where the couple actually filed for divorce.

However, at a conference earlier this year in Las Vegas to announce the launch of her new foundation, Princess Khaliya was asked about her royal links. Pausing for a moment, she said: ‘I married somebody who is a Prince by honorary decree through the British system because of the aid that they gave to the Indian state during the Battle of Independence…it’s kind of complicated, it’s more of a title that’s connected to a people than to a land.

‘Technically it’s my husband’s domain - my ex-husband’s domain.’  And when asked if she was royal, she replied: ‘I am and I’m not!’

It is understood that Princess Khaliya lived for a time after the split at 666 Greenwich Street, an apartment building also once home to Monica Lewinsky.

However, just weeks ago, she sealed the deal on a sprawling two-bedroom apartment in a modern Condo building on the Lower East Side, featuring gorgeous views overlooking the city, paying $2,240,150 in total.

And she has most definitely been seen living the single life after being pictured at trendy Palm Springs musical festival Coachella in April, joining friends British socialite Lady Victoria Hervey and fashion editor Indira Cesarine.

The Princess’s father Professor Norman White is an IT specialist, and his wife, Dr Margaret White, is a psychologist - and they live a rather more modest life than the Aga Khan in Montclair, New Jersey.

Speaking at Catalyst Week in Las Vegas, Princess Khaliya said: ‘My story is one of listening to your heart and following your intuition and taking paths that are not always the most obvious or the easiest ones - or the most intelligent ones. And I think there’s a lesson to be learned in that.'

She discussed her time in the Peace Corps and meeting her ex-husband, which led her to setting up her own foundation, adding: ‘Every time I followed my heart, my intuition and my consciousness led me down another path.’

Her foundation, she said, aims to ‘harness technology in Silicon Valley and use it in the developing world.’

The striking blonde only completed the deal on her new home just weeks before her ex-brother-in law Prince Rahim, 41, married 25-year-old Kendra Spears.

The eldest son of Aga Khan IV and one of the 10 richest royals in the world, who is now said to be worth an estimated $800 million, married Seattle-born model Kendra - now rechristened Princess Salwa Aga Khan - on August 31 in a Muslim ceremony at a palace in Geneva, Switzerland.

But the couple then celebrated again in lavish style again on Saturday night at Manhattan’s Museum of Natural History.

Guests including Naomi Campbell, who introduced the couple at a party, Leonardo DiCaprio, Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis, actors Edward Norton and Rashida Jones toasted the prince and his beautiful bride, Page Six reported.

The newlyweds and their guests partied until the early hours under the Central Park West museum’s famous 94-foot-long fiberglass replica of a blue whale. Billionaires Ron Burkle, Vivi Nevo and Prince Vincent of Liechtenstein were said to be in attendance, as well as a host of top models, including Karlie Kloss, who is close friends with the bride.

The 250 guests were treated to performances by British rockers Band of Skulls and American indie band the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were seen performing at the bash in a picture posted on Twitter today.

Prince Rahim is the heir to the title and fortune of Aga Khan IV, who is the Imam of Shia Ismaili Muslims and is considered a descendant of Prophet Muhammad.

Kendra – or Princess Salwa - is a regular on the catwalks of Paris and Milan. She was touted as the “next Cindy Crawford” after launching her career in 2008 and became a face of Escada, Prada, Diane von Furstenberg and other top brands.

Prince Hussain’s divorce from Princess Khaliya is just one of a string of marital breakdowns that have blighted the family of the leader of the world’s 12 million Ismaili Muslims.

The Aga Khan has been married twice — his first wife and Rahim and Hussain’s mother is the former English model Sally Croker-Poole.

He has been separated from his second wife, Gabriele Thyssen, otherwise known as Begum Inaara, since 2004, but they are still not divorced after a French court quashed a £54million divorce settlement ruling from 2011.

The couple, who have a 13-year-old son, Aly, are now expected to face a retrial in around a year's time in what has already been an eight-year legal battle fought in Switzerland, Britain and now France.

Meanwhile, the Aga’s daughter, Princess Zahra, 41, wed Dorset farmer’s son and former male model Mark Boyden, but that union ended in 2005 after seven years and two children.
