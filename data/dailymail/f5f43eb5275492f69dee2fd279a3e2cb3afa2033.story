For a man who really did not want to talk on Saturday evening, Jose Mourinho woke on Sunday having had a serious re-think, invited himself on to Sky Sports and let loose.

While admitting he might be talking his way to a touchline ban, the Chelsea manager launched a live verbal assault from his position on the Goals on Sunday sofa, taking aim at various targets which included an attack on Sky’s own coverage.

It was very neatly planned and executed by a man employed as an ambassador for rival broadcasters BT Sport, and James Beattie, the show’s scheduled guest, was nowhere to be seen.

Mourinho says referees should be given assistance by video technology if they can't get decisions right

'Mourinho is wrong to imply an orchestrated campaign, but entitled to ask questions. His players, fine players, are frequently under siege.'

Mourinho has bemoaned these things for weeks but Burnley striker Ashley Barnes and referee Martin Atkinson pushed him over the edge as Chelsea dropped precious points in a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

He lashed out at Barnes, branding his tackle on Nemanja Matic ‘criminal’ and ‘career-ending’ and recalled for the audience a seven-match ban imposed on the striker two years ago when he tripped a referee while playing for Brighton against Bolton.

And he called for more technology to help officials who ‘can’t see a penalty three metres in front of him’ and claimed Chelsea were ‘not getting the respect they deserve’ with a long sequence of bad decisions.

It was an incredible performance, even by Mourinho standards of showmanship and revolved around his four chosen moments from the Burnley game: two failed penalty appeals and two challenges by Barnes.

‘What can I say that everybody doesn’t know?’ the Chelsea manager began. ‘Sometimes there is space for discussion where you have one view and I have another, but I can’t believe these four incidents are open to interpretation.

Mourinho shot from the lip during his surprise appearance on Goals on Sunday on Sky Sports

‘At half-time Burnley should be playing with 10 men and Chelsea should have had two penalties and be winning 3-0, or let’s say 2-0 if we miss one of the penalties. The reality is that in the end we end the game with 10 men and we lose two points.’

The first penalty appeal was for handball when a shot by Branislav Ivanovic crashed into Michael Kightly’s outstretched arm.

‘The arm stopped the ball hitting the target,’ said Mourinho. ‘He’s far away; it’s not one metre, not a few inches, it’s quite far. Players should be taught to keep balance even in difficult situations, making difficult bio-mechanical actions and putting their arms behind the body to avoid this. For me, this is a penalty everywhere.

‘The best players in the world make mistakes, they miss penalties, and this gentleman is one of the top referees in this country and Europe and he can also make mistakes. He made four important mistakes. It is consistent but we must search for consistency in the right way. The lawyer who has lost 15 cases out of 15 is consistent but you don’t want that lawyer.’

The second penalty appeal was for a push by Jason Shackell on Costa, but Mourinho went back to the opening game of the Barclays Premier League campaign when his centre forward was booked for a dive at Turf Moor.

Atkinson, the referee for Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley, was criticised for his decisions on Saturday

‘The penalty story with Diego Costa started on day one, because it is a penalty and a red card for the goalkeeper,’ he said. ‘Michael Oliver — also one of the top referees in the country and soon to be one of the best in Europe — gives a yellow card to Diego and a free-kick against Chelsea.’

During the course of this 29-minute section of the show, he noted other penalties his team deserved but did not get — against Everton, Southampton, Liverpool and Tottenham — and insisted only once had he benefited from a dubious decision, when Gary Cahill escaped a handball at Liverpool.

‘Probably I am risking my place in the dug-out in the final because I risk being suspended by having this conversation in a studio,’ Mourinho went on. ‘I know in football sometimes you get them and sometimes you don’t but it’s too much. I try to be calm and controlled but my players are not getting the respect they deserve.’

When it came to analysing the Barnes challenges, one on Ivanovic and one on Matic, which provoked his dismissal for a retaliatory shove, the Chelsea manager said: ‘This Burnley player involved in two actions has a grey past. There was a very dark point in his career when he was at Brighton and suspended for seven matches, because of a big incident with a referee.

The Chelsea boss was particularly unhappy with the performance of referee Atkinson

‘Should this player be chased because of what he did in the past? I don’t think so. When people look at these two incidents I hope they only see these two incidents. I don’t think it should have any relation with his history.

‘When I see Diego Costa on day one in the Premier League, penalty and red card to the goalkeeper, game over 2-0, transformed into a free-kick and yellow for Costa, I think he has changed country but brought with him his past in the eyes of the officials. This is clearly not fair.

‘When I finish the game against Liverpool and go to the dressing room, the first thing I see on the big screen we have in the dressing room is about Diego Costa’s ‘crimes’. Well, I would like to know how Sky Sports describe the actions of the Burnley player yesterday when you call what Diego Costa did a crime.’

With his sidekick Chris Kamara struck by temporary paralysis beside him, Sky host Ben Shephard admitted there may have been a mistake with the language in the immediate aftermath of Costa’s stamp on Emre Can, in the Capital One Cup semi-final, which prompted a three-match ban.

Mourinho covered a range of subjects during his appearance on Goals on Sunday 

‘Did you apologise to Chelsea or to Diego or to me as Chelsea manager?’ asked Mourinho. ‘You did not. You never apologised. I don’t like the use of language and don’t like it that immediately there is public judgment.

‘You give no space to the people who have to decide. The pressure was so much that it gave no space and you don’t do this with every club and every player. When you say Diego’s “crimes” because he put his foot on another man you have to say this is a criminal tackle, minimum. When Diego Costa had a three-match ban, tell me how many matches you think this player deserves.

‘What happened was similar to what happened to Eden Hazard at Stoke but I would say yesterday was worse because this was “end of career”, I can’t find an adjective any stronger than to say “end of career”. Matic is a lucky guy. I can’t find words to describe what that player did.

‘Matic had reason to lose his emotions. What are the consequences of Matic’s push on the other player? Nothing. One second later, he stands and goes. The consequence for Matic could be the end of career.’

Mourinho did not appear satisfied with a post-match conversation he had with Atkinson at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

‘I am not attacking the honesty of anyone,’ he added. ‘I am not trying to bring the game into disrepute — a sentence you love in this country because this is always what they use when they want to punish me. I’m just trying to be honest.

‘Of course, they are trying but they are not doing it well. If the ref can’t see a penalty three metres in front of him some referee in front of a screen can’t miss it. It will protect the integrity and honesty of the referees. I think technology can help.’

Mourinho stuck around with Shephard and Kamara to analyse the rest of the Saturday action but by then he had got what he wanted to off his chest.

30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken. It should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes.

69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. It was a shocking tackle that merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick.
