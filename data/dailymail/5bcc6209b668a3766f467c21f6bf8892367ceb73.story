A Facebook campaign which claims alleged killer nanny Yoselyn Ortega was not responsible for the deaths of two children in her care has provoked outrage.

The page 'Support Innocence of Nanny Yoselyn Ortega' - set up by an anonymous group - is pleading for any information 'that could help bring the real killer or killers to be arrested.'

And since the page was launched on October 29th - four days after the brutal stabbings of Lucia Krim and brother Leo in their Manhattan home - it has sparked fury from people who believe that Ortega, 50,  should 'rot in hell', be 'put to death' to those who think it is plain 'disgusting'.

'We believe she did not do this crime and she deserves to have her day in court to defend against the charges to prove her case in a not guilty verdict,' said the administrators to Radaronline.com - who are now facing calls for them to shut down the page.

While the family nanny has admitted to harming the two children in her care on the Upper West Side, police sources have told the New York Daily News that she has not confessed to the double murder.

And users of the social networking site have responded with fury to some of the more outrageous allegations made on the page that are aimed at providing evidence for Ortega's innocence.

'This is absolutely disgusting,' wrote one Facebook user.

'I hope you burn in hell along with Yoselyn you piece of cr*p. You need a psych evaluation because it's obvious you're attention seeking.'

Claiming to represent the family of Yoselyn Ortega, the page has only received 16 'likes' since its launch almost two weeks ago and asks readers to pray for her freedom.

'The only reason I would ever pray for her recovery is so she can be released from the hospital and thrown in a jail cell where she will most likely be beaten by other inmates,' posted a furious Facebook user.

Indeed, a rival page has launched expressing outrage at one Facebook user in particular who has signed up to the page which protests Ortega's innocence.

At the beginning of the week Ortega is alleged to have denied the murders of the two children she was caring for and instead told the police 'Marina knows what happened.'

Marina Krim returned to her New York home on October 25 with her youngest daughter to find her children Lucia, six, and Leo, two, dead in a pool of blood before walking in on nanny Yoselyn Ortega stabbing herself in the throat.

When Ortega came out of a medically-induced coma on last Saturday, detectives immediately questioned her about the brutal slayings, before charging her with first-degree murder.

Ortega revealed from her hospital bed that she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to do and asked her to do the housework. She also said she was involved in a vicious argument with the children's mother one day before the brutal homicides.

Ortega waived her right to have a lawyer present during questioning when she ominously told the detective, 'Marina knows what happened', a source told the New York Times.

RadarOnline reported yesterday that Ortega 'told NYPD detectives that she was involved in an epic argument with Marina Krim the day before the children were tragically murdered.'

'Yoselyn also said that when she left at the end of the day before the murders, Marina ignored her when she said good-bye and this made her very, very angry,' Radar's source continued.

Yoselyn became extremely animated when she discussed the incident with police, telling officers that  she had numerous disagreements with mother Marina about how the kids were being cared for.

Marina didn't think Yoselyn was interacting with the kids enough and was giving them junk food when she was out of sight.

Ortega told police when she woke up from her coma that she was angry because the family wanted her to clean as well as look after the children.

A Dominican Republic native, Ortega was questioned by police after allegedly butchered six-year-old Lucia and two-year-old Leo while they were under her care at an Upper West Side, Manhattan, apartment almost two weeks ago.

Law enforcement officials told the New York Post that Mr and Mrs Krim asked their financially-strapped nanny to do simple housework as a way to earn money, thinking they were doing her a good turn. All this did was enrage her.

'She said something like, "I'm paid to watch the children, not clean up and do housework",' a law-enforcement source said of Yoselyn Ortega’s statements to police after she woke up from a medically-induced coma on Sunday.

'There was friction between her and the family.'

It was also revealed at the beginning of the week that Marina and Kevin Krim were worried about Ortega's job performance in the weeks leading up to the October 25 slaying and had told her that if she didn't improve her job performance they might need to replace her.

A law-enforcement source told the Post: 'She was told that if she didn't improve her work, she would be let go.'

Two weeks ago, the mother of CNBC executive Kevin Krim said that the young family treated Ortega, as they would one of their own, 'bending over backwards' to help her and even buying plane tickets so she could fly to the Dominican Republic with them.

Oretega allegedly repaid this kindness by murdering her children before trying to kill herself. Marina Krim discovered her son and daughter, Leo and Lulu, in a pool of blood in a bathtub, each with multiple stab wounds.

She was due to meet Ortega and her other two children at the local swimming pool with her now only surviving child Nessie, three. But when they failed to show up, she returned to her three-bedroom, $10,000-a-month pre-war apartment at West 75th Street and found it dark, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said.

When she went into the bedroom, she discovered her children in a pool of blood and a bleeding Ortega.

The nanny, who had slit her wrists, then plunged a kitchen knife into her own neck as the horrified mother walked into the grisly scene, police said. She stabbed herself with such force that she fractured a vertebra in her neck, police said.

Neighbor Rima Starr, 63, recalls the moment she heard Mrs Krim make the grisly discovery.: 'I heard blood curdling screams and I went down to the lobby and there was the mother screaming, hunched over the three year old.

'At time she was screaming things like: "I'll never speak to her again", repeating that over and over again, then "it's all right, you'll be all right, you'll be alright" to the child.

'Then she would get waves of the reality of what just happened and then she'd go into just plain bloodcurdling screams with her arms flailing out to the sides.'

One neighbor revealed the superintendent of the apartment block went into the apartment and questioned Ortega, demanding: 'So you cut her throat? So you stabbed her in the neck?'

His wife then came out to assist and told horrified neighbours who had heard the screams: 'Two babies, in the bath, nanny' and made a cutting sign across her throat.

Mrs Friedman added: 'At that point I knew the nanny had something to do with it'.

Neighbours dialed 911 and, although Lulu and Leo reportedly appeared to be breathing when medics arrived, they were pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.

Her
husband, Kevin Krim, had been on a business trip and was met by police 
at the airport when he returned to New York. Officers recounted the 
horror to him and he was escorted to the hospital.

The family had moved to New York from San Francisco within the last few years, and Mr Krim was named general manager of CNBC's digital media division in 
March.

He is a Harvard graduate and has recently worked at Bloomberg and Yahoo, according to his LinkedIn profile.

The children's 
grandmother on their father's side, Karen Krim, told said that the 
family hired Ortega a year ago, until which time Mrs Krim had been a 
stay-at-home mother.

When
Leo was born, they searched for a nanny. They even spent nine days with
her family in the Dominican Republic, as documented on Mrs Krim's 
online journal.

'They just bent over backwards being nice to this woman,' Karen Kim told the New York Daily News. 'They
 were always doing things that were just fabulous for her. I’m just 
astounded, and I have no idea why something like this would happen.'

She added: 'We’re just having a really, really hard time here. It’s the worst nightmare any parent could ever have.'
