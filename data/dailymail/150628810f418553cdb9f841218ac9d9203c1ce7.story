A passionate tree surgeon created a video to show what his unique, dangerous and perhaps misunderstood job entails.

Capturing footage of himself on a GoPro camera, Cezary Romanowski documented his experiences over a period of several months.

The video begins with Cezary, a tree surgeon from Poland, sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw and filling it up with fuel while in a snowy woodland.

Suitably prepared, Cezary ties himself to a tree and makes his way up it using spikes – also known as gaffs or spurs – attached to his chainsaw boots.

What follows is a fast-paced montage sequence showing Cezary dispatching trees of all shapes and sizes.

Sawing through a particularly large trunk, the tree surgeon appears to balance in the air before taking one hand off his chainsaw – while its teeth continue to rotate – and reaching for a wedge.

Cezary prepares by attaching himself to the tree before climbing up the trunk and cutting it from the top

Jamming it in the gap, Cezary makes his way around the tree, systematically tapping the wedge in further as he goes, until the crane is able to lift the top of the trunk away.

Another clip of the tree surgeon shows him drawing a smiley face onto a piece of trunk.

While the following one presents the three stages in which he safely chops down a rather large tree positioned in the middle of a residential area.

Cezary also shows off how sharp his axe is by running its blade along a piece of paper, after cutting down a tree and throwing his chainsaw behind his back to let it hang by its cord.

The video concludes with the tree surgeon chopping off the many branches of a tree, after winching himself into position.

Tree surgeons, or arborists as they are formally known, cultivate, manage and study individual trees, shrubs and vines.

Their job therefore differs to that of a logger or a forester, who focus on large areas of woodland.

Often dangerous, tree surgeons are sometimes required to work near power wires but may also plan, consult, write reports and give legal testimony.

In the UK, arborists can gain qualifications up to and including a Master's degree.
