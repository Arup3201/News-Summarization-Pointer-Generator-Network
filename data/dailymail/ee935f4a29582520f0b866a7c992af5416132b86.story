Courageous: Farm worker Paul Gray, 50, died as he bravely tried to rescue his unconscious colleague Craig Whipps, 27, pictured, from waist-high slurry. Both men died at the scene

A courageous farm worker died as he bravely tried to rescue his unconscious colleague from waist-high slurry, an inquest has heard.

Paul Gray, 50, twice went back into an aging slurry tank at to rescue Craig Whipps, 27, despite the slurry and noxious gasses.

But despite his heroics, both men died at the scene in Albyns Farm, Stapleford Tawney, Essex

Farm worker, Richard Brown, was met with the horrifying scene at about 5pm on July 15, 2011, after returning from spreading slurry on a nearby field.

He told Chelmsford Coroners' Court: 'There was slurry gushing all over the place and running down the farm. When I walked in there it was near enough waist deep.

'Craig was laying on his back unconscious in the slurry. Mr Gray hopped over the wall and jumped down onto the concrete to get him.

'I went in and tried to get Craig but I could feel my chest tightening up and felt sick and dizzy.

'We all got told to leave the scene because of the gasses. It wasn't until after that I found out Paul was still in there and that he'd died.'

The jury of six men and five women heard how a number of farm workers who had been milking cows nearby, including Mr Gray and Calvin Otto, had attempted to rescue Mr Whipps but had been overwhelmed by the noxious gasses.

Robert Torrance, who has run the farm since taking it over from his father in 1971, rescued Mr Otto from the slurry before seeing Mr Gray attempting to rescue of Mr Whipps.

He said: 'I got a phone call from Richard saying there was a disaster and slurry was running everywhere.

'I ran there and could see slurry flowing down.

'I could see Craig submerged - his left boot has on top on the shoot and the rest of his body was submerged.

'I ran down into the slurry but to my horror I saw Calvin submerged in fast running slurry. Between me and Richard we dragged him out and put him in the recovery position.

'I then went back into the slurry to do the same for Craig. I was able to get to Craig and tried to pull him up with his left arm but I couldn't manage it.

'I saw Paul jump into the slurry and I said "Get back - there is nothing that can be done".

'At that point I lost consciousness - that was the last time I saw him.'

Mr Gray was later pronounced dead at the scene, alongside Mr Whipps, by ambulance crews at around 6.10pm.

Firefighters had also tried in vain to rescue the men as they pumped 120,000 litres of slurry from the pit on to a nearby field.

After the tragedy, it emerged married Mr Whipps, a dad-of-one, had been expecting another child with his wife, Vicky.

Mrs Whipps previously paid tribute to her husband, saying: 'Craig was a lovely husband, who should have had many years of family life ahead of him.

'His whole family are very proud of what he achieved in the time he was with us.

'Now we just want to try to raise awareness of some of the hidden dangers of working in an agricultural environment in the hope that the same thing will not happen to anyone else.'

Michael Wangermann, a personal injury specialist at solicitors Ashton KCJ, is representing Mr Whipps's family.

He said after the incident: 'Craig's family are keen to highlight the issue in the hope that other families will not have to go through the ordeal they are currently enduring.

'In this case the volume of slurry and the fumes released were overpowering, even though the tank was stored outside.'

A health and safety report into the incident concluded Mr Whipp had removed bolts on the four metre high slurry tank in an attempt to fix a broken slurry release valve causing 'a massive and unstoppable leak'.

Susan Matthews, health and safety inspector, said: 'Some bolts were found in the slurry and also a spanner from Craig's tool kit.

'It was a process of deduction.'

Robert Dawton, specialist inspector for the Health and Safety Executive, went on to explain to the court about the dangers of hydrogen sulphide - a potentially deadly gas produced by farm slurry.

In large quantities the gas - which in low levels resembles the smell of rotting eggs - can paralyse the respiratory system in the brain.

He continued: 'It is a very toxic gas.

'I am aware of an incident in the U.S. where a family of five died in similar circumstances.

'People go to rescue them as they don't realise the situation they are putting themselves in.'

Pathologist Dr Nathaniel Carey found the cause of death for Mr Whipps and Mr Gray to be emersion in slurry.

Abundant quantities of swallowed slurry were found in Mr Gray's stomach.

The inquest is due to conclude tomorrow.
