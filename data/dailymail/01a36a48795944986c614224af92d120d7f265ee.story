A quadriplegic man had to leave his wheelchair behind when an airline told him he could not bring it onboard.

Peter Darch, a former West Australian of the Year, was travelling from Perth to Bali with his wife, parents and grandparents when he was approached by the same Air Asia staff who had checked him in an hour before takeoff to say they would not stow the wheelchair.

His wife, Azucena, was forced to stay at the airport overnight and wait pay $700 for a flight on another airline who did allow her take the foldable, electric wheelchair with her.

Peter Darch, 29, was not allowed to bring his electric wheelchair on board an Air Asia flight last Tuesday

The 29-year-old said he was 'disgusted' by the move.

Mr Darch, from Mundurah, Western Australia, who was 2011's Western Australia Young Person of the Year, has complained to the Australian Human Rights Commission about last Tuesday's incident, saying it was disability discrimination.

Initially the airline cited the wheelchair's batteries as the reason why they could not let it onboard.

But despite having a dangerous goods certificate that ruled the batteries safe for travelling, the airline still refused to take it.

Mr Darch said he tried to compromise by offering to remove the batteries and repurchase some in Bali.

The wheelchair, similar to the one above, was instead taken by his wife to Bail after she forked out $700 for another flight

'The airline’s response was no, that even without the battery – which had originally been used as the reason the chair could not travel on the airline – it would not be allowed in the cargo hold,' he told Perth Now.

Mr Darch also said the size of the chair was not an issue as it could be folded down to a size that was 'not much bigger than a suitcase'.

Furthermore, when asked if he could use one of the airline's airport wheelchairs to transport him to his Bali hotel, he was also told 'no'.

Air Asia has denied Peter Darch was discriminated against by staff at Perth Airport

To get around, Mr Darch had to hire a wheelchair from a travel company in Bali.

Unfortunately this is not the first case Australian Disability Discrimination Commissioner Graeme Innes was aware of.

Mr Innes said it was potentially a breach of legislation if an airline refused to carry a person's mobility aid.

In a statement, Air Asia denied Mr Darch had been discriminated against.

A spokesperson said their website had a strict policy on the storage of battery-operated wheelchairs and mobility devices.
