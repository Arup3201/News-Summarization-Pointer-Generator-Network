A 24-year-old man was tasered at least 13 times before he died in police custody, an attorney for the deceased victim has revealed.

Gregory Lewis Towns, Jr was killed last April in East Point, Georgia after he was arrested by police who responded to reports of a domestic dispute with his girlfriend.

Towns died after Cpl Howard Weems and former Sgt Marcus Eberhart tasered him a combined 13 times while he was laying on the ground, in an attempt to get him up and moving, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.

Justice: 24-year-old Gregory Lewis Towns, Jr was killed on April 11 after he was tasered by police officers a combined 13 times. An attorney for his family said on Tuesday that they plan to file a lawsuit. Above, a picture of the incident

Police even tased Towns when he was wet and lying in a creek 

However, this revelation contradicts what the officers self-reported at the time - that they only tasered Towns six times.

The Medical Examiner later ruled Towns death a homicide.

Now Chris Stewart, an attorney for Towns' family, plans to file a lawsuit against the department later this week for wrongful death.

'This situation is indefensible,' Stewart said.

The Fulton County District Attorney is also awaiting the evidence of an investigation into the incident, before deciding whether to bring up criminal charges to a grand jury.

In a press conference on Tuesday, Stewart recounted the deadly confrontation on April 11, after Weems and Eberhardt responded to a 911 at Towns' girlfriend's townhouse, where she lived with their now 7-month-old son.

After getting into a foot-chase with Towns, the man ended up on the ground.

According to records stored on the taser, and eyewitness accounts, Towns was tasered about 13 times - including once while he was wet in a creek.

Eberhardt triggered his taser 10 times to Weems' three times.

Stewart says Towns was on the ground, and that the officers were trying to get him up and moving to go back to the squad car.

Savage: Chris Stewart, an attorney for Towns' family, says the officers used their tasers to 'cattle prod' the 24-year-old

'He wasn't cursing. He wasn't being abusive. He was saying, "I’m tired,"' Stewart said.

'They used their Tasers as a cattle prod on Mr Towns while handcuffed.'

Stewart adds that the incident was not racially-motivated since both of the officers were black, like Towns.

'Mr Towns' killing is not about race. It's about police brutality...going to the extreme.'

Cpl Weems continues to appeal his firing from the department. Neither officers issued a statement following news of the lawsuit.
