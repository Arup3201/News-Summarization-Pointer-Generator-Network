Mexico has sent severely burnt fragments of teeth and bone to Austria for DNA analysis as it attempts to identify human remains suspected to belong to the 43 missing students.

The human remains, found in Guerrero, Mexico, are so badly burned they turn to dust when touched and must be examined using highly specialized technology not available in Mexico.

It comes as Mexico Attorney General Jesus Murillo has described the ruthlessly efficient body disposal method used by the gang which left the remains so difficult to identify.

Murillo, who is leading the investigation into the missing students, said: 'Forensic teams have recommended that studies be conducted in the most highly specialized laboratories in the world,' Bloomberg reported.

'The teeth that were found are in such a charred state that touching them almost turns them to dust.' 

Apprehended suspects of the gang responsible for the students' execution have now provided authorities with a blow-by-blow account of how they killed them and then disposed of the bodies.

The New Yorker reported the students were piled into the back of trucks and driven to a remote rubbish dump in Cocula, southwest Mexico.

Those that were still alive were bound and thrown into a pit atop rubber tires and wood. They were then interrogated, executed, doused in petrol and set on fire.

Once the 14-hour fire finished burning, the killers sifted through the human remains, breaking their bones into pieces before bagging them and tossing them into a river.

Jose Luis Abarca, who was previously mayor of Iguala, left, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda right, were found and arrested in Mexico City on Monday and are believed to have masterminded the massacre

The former mayor of Iguala Jose Luis Abarca, along with his wife Maria de los Angeles, have both been apprehended after it was claimed they masterminded the massacre.

After weeks in hiding, the two were caught in Mexico City early last week.

Prosecutors claim Abarca demanded the students, who were protesting at the time of their apprehension by local police, be 'taught a lesson' so they didn't interrupt a speech by his wife.

After being arrested on his orders, the student teachers were then handed over to the gang who executed them, it is alleged.

Meanwhile, demonstrators set fire to the local legislature building on Wednesday in the capital of the southwestern state of Guerrero in protests over the massacre of the students by corrupt police and thugs from drug gangs.

Violent demonstrations rocked several other states, where protesters blocked an airport and damaged the local office of President Enrique Pena Nieto's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

In Guerrero's capital of Chilpancingo, members of a teachers union set fire to the session hall in the state assembly building while also torching several cars outside.

Firefighters extinguished the blaze and no injuries were reported. Protesters also set a fire at administrative offices of the state's education department.

The protests have led to mass cancellations this week in the hotels of Acapulco, the famous beach resort, ahead of a long holiday weekend. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters scuffled with riot police and burned PRI offices in Chilpancingo.

'God willing, this type of vandalism does not repeat itself, this is not the way,' said resident Constantino Garcia. 'I think that this is not what society hopes for when demanding justice.'

Tens of thousands of Mexicans have taken to the streets in recent weeks in peaceful protests over the government's handling of the case of the missing students, which has become the biggest challenge yet to President Pena Nieto.

The president is on a trip to China this week, which infuriated protesters and relatives of the students. They believe he cares more about Mexico's business interests than trying to deal with the gang violence that has ravaged much of the country for years.

In neighboring Michoacan state, which has also been a focal point of drug gang violence, students blocked the main entrance to the state capital's airport.

Another group of demonstrators broke windows, furniture and computers at local PRI offices in the capital of Morelia.
