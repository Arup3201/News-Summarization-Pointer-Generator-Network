Mixed emotions: Statue of Hitler kneeling in Warsaw ghetto where tens of thousands of Jews died has upset descendents

A modern artist has caused huge controversy after placing a statue of Adolf Hitler praying on his knees in the former Warsaw Ghetto.

Some Jewish groups have expressed fury at the 'senseless' decision to install the provocative artwork in the area where thousands of Jews were forced to live during the rule of the Nazi regime.

In total, around 300,000 Jews from the Ghetto died or were sent to their death in concentration camps.

The statue by Italian artist Maurizio 
Cattelan, entitled 'HIM', has attracted a large number of visitors since
 its installation last month.

The work is visible only from a distance, and the artist has not said what he intends viewers to read into Hitler's pose.

Organisers of the exhibition of which 
the statue is a part say its point is to make people reflect on the 
nature of evil - but some are angered by its placement in such a 
sensitive site.

One Jewish advocacy group,
 the Simon Wiesenthal Center, this week called the statue's placement 'a
 senseless provocation which insults the memory of the Nazis' Jewish 
victims'.

'As far as the Jews were concerned, 
Hitler's only "prayer" was that they be wiped off the face of the 
earth,' said the group's Israel director, Efraim Zuroff.

However, others have praised the artwork's emotional impact. And organisers defend putting it on display in the former ghetto.

Fabio Cavallucci, director of the Centre
 for Contemporary Art, which oversaw the installation, said: 'There is 
no intention from the side of the artist or the center to insult Jewish 
memory.

Controversy: This statue of Adolf Hitler on his knees praying has been installed in the Warsaw Ghetto

'It's an artwork that tries to speak about the situation of hidden evil everywhere.'

The Warsaw Ghetto was an area of the city which the Nazis sealed off after they invaded Poland.

They forced Jews to live in cramped, inhuman conditions there as they awaited deportation to death camps.

Many died from hunger or disease or were shot by the Germans before they could be transported to the camps.

Hidden: The statue by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan is visible only through a hole in a door

Fury: The statue has drawn condemnation from Jewish groups which regard it as a 'senseless provocation'

The Hitler installation is just one 
object in a retrospective of Cattelan's work titled 'Amen', a show that 
explores life, death, good and evil. The other works are on display at 
the centre itself, which is housed in the Ujazdowski Castle.

The
 statue is visible from a hole in a wooden gate across town on Prozna 
Street. Viewers only see the back of the small figure praying in a 
courtyard. Because of its small size, it appears to be a harmless 
schoolboy.

'Every criminal was once a tender, innocent and defenseless child,' the centre says in a commentary on the work.

Visitors: Some who have seen the statue praised its shocking emotional impact

Thought-provoking: Exhibition organisers say they want viewers to reflect on the nature of evil

The Warsaw Ghetto was established in the Polish capital in 1940, while the country was being occupied by Nazi Germany.

All 400,000 Jews living in the city, which was then a major centre of Jewish culture, were ordered to live in the area, which was surrounded by a 10ft wall.

Even though the Ghetto housed 30 per cent of Warsaw's population, it occupied just one-fortieth of the city's area, leading to unbearably cramped conditions.

The area was plagued with disease and starvation, causing the deaths of thousands - but the worst horrors came between July and September 1942, when more than 250,000 residents were sent to the Treblinka camp, where nearly all were murdered by the Nazis.

In January 1943, German soldiers started another round of deportations, but this time the Jewish residents fought back.

The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising briefly succeeded in stopping the deportations, but later that year was brutally put down. 56,000 Jews were killed or deported in retribution.

Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said he was consulted on the installation's placement ahead of time and did not oppose it because he accepted the artist's attempt to raise moral questions by provoking viewers.

He said he was reassured by curators who told him there was no intention of rehabilitating Hitler, but rather of showing that evil can present itself in the guise of a 'sweet praying child'.

'I felt there could be educational value to it,' said Mr Schudrich, who also wrote an introduction to the exhibition's catalogue in which he says art can 'force us to face the evil of the world.'

On Friday, a stream of people walked by to view the work, and many praised it.

'It had a big emotional impact on me. It's provocative, but it's not offensive,' said Zofia Jablonska, a 30-year-old lawyer.

'Having him pray in the place where he would kill people - this was the best place to put it.'

Cattelan caused controversy in Warsaw in 2000 when another gallery showed his work 'La Nona Ora' - 'The Ninth Hour' - which depicts Pope John Paul II being crushed by a meteorite.

That offended many in Poland, which is deeply Catholic and was John Paul's homeland.
