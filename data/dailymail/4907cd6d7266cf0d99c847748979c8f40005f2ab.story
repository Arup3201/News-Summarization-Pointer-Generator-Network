A student who was left in a coma after a minivan driven by a classmate crashed in New Zealand last year has returned to university, almost a year after the near-fatal accident.

Meg Theriault was seriously injured in the crash which killed three Boston University students in May 2012, while they were spending a semester studying in New Zealand and Australia.

The promising 21-year-old had to have a chunk of her skull removed to heal a dangerous blood clot in her brain, but now she has made a remarkable recovery and has been attending classes at BU again.

Return: Meg Theriault has attended her first class at Boston University since being involved in a car crash

Learning: The BU student is auditing an accountancy class and received a B on her first test

Reunion: Meg with Dustin Holstein, another student who was involved in the accident in New Zealand

Meg does not remember the crash, which saw the minivan driven by Stephen Houseman drift off the road and roll over, killing Austin Brashears, Daniela Lekhno and Roch Jauberty.

Five other students were injured - but none so badly as Meg, who was discovered at the scene by classmate Dustin Holstein breathing in a way 'where it's like you're on the verge of dying'.

Rather than returning home to Massachusetts a few days later as she had planned, the business major was confined to a hospital bed in New Zealand.

She had a fractured skull and blood clots in the brain, causing doctors to remove part of her skull to relieve the swelling.

Damage: The popular student had part of her brain removed and replaced with a plastic implant

Care: Meg's mother Deb helps her navigate the stairs in their home in Salisbury, Massachusetts

Her parents Todd and Deb - who later said they did not blame Mr Houseman for the crash, because 'that could have been any one of our kids at the wheel' - flew across the world to be at her side.

It took a month before Meg smiled again, and at that time she was still confined to hospital in Boston.

Her flowing hair brunette hair had been cut short and she was made to wear a hockey helmet to protect her brain where the skull had been cut out.

She insisted she would complete her degree at BU and get a top job as an accountant - but two months after the crash, she still could not remember her multiplication tables.

Meg underwent intense physical and speech therapy intended to teach her how to feed, bathe and dress herself.

Agony: The student had to wear a hockey helmet for months to protect her brain from further damage

Rehab: A therapist worked with Meg in the months after the accident to help her walk again

In early August, she was allowed to return home, to a house in the town of Salisbury which had been specially kitted out to take account of her condition.

With the help of extra bannisters and railings and a modified bathroom, she started to be able to take care of herself - but she still needed her parents to drive her in to Boston twice a week for therapy.

Meg started seeing other people again around this time, but was humiliated by having to wear her helmet and told two friends: 'Sorry you have to see me like this.'

She was still plagued by her injuries - and doctors said the damage to her brain had caused her to overestimate the pace of her own recovery.

But in September, on the first day of the new academic year, she finally had her skull repaired, with surgeons inserting a custom-made piece of plastic where the bone had been cut away.

She was keen to return to college following the operation, but her therapist advised her to attend community college or audit a BU class instead.

University officials allowed her to audit an accounting class this semester, and in January she made a triumphant return to the campus.

She slipped in to her first class a few minutes late, blaming traffic - the lecturer jokingly replied, 'Excuses.'

The results from Meg's first test came in February - 'I got a B, which is OK,' she said. 'Not great, not phenomenal.'

In addition to her return to college, the student has reunited with some of those who were also involved in the horror crash in New Zealand during what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.

She has reunited with Mr Houseman, who was banned from the road for six months after pleading guilty to careless driving.

And she has also seen Mr Holstein, who has suffered flashbacks since the accident but said that having Meg back at BU would help heal the mental scars.

'She can tell her story on how she fought back from such a terrible accident,' he said. 'And that alone, at least people will remember who was lost on that day and the good that can come out of a situation that was so horrible.'
