Police sources told the New York Daily News that the 16-year-old girl and Sosa were romantically involved for a year and engaged in intercourse on numerous occasions.

They said the girl confessed to what happened after her mother saw text messages on her cell phone.

Police told the newspaper Sosa and the girl first met one another while at church. 

'There has never been a situation where they have been alone in the same room together,' Sosa's lawyer Cary London told the Daily News.

Sosa's Facebook profile says he studied theology at United Christian College in North Carolina.

Sosa is facing rape, sexual misconduct, sex abuse and endangering the welfare of a child charges, police said. He is a police officer with the 46th Precinct.

The Bronx District Attorney's Office told CBS New York that Sosa is out on a personal recognizance bond and will be in court next month.

The New York Post reported that Sosa has been with the NYPD for seven years and is now on an unpaid suspension.
