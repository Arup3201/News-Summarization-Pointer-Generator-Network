A 14-year-old triathlete who runs marathons across the globe to honor her cancer victim father has become the youngest person to complete a marathon on every continent.

Winter Vinecki, from Michigan but lives in Utah, nabbed the title after completing her seventh marathon, this time in Athens, Greece.

She finished the race in four hours, three minutes and 53 seconds and said: 'This is for you, Dad', as she finished, the Statesman Journal reported.

Winter began running at five-years-old and when her father died from prostate cancer in 2009, she decided to complete a marathon on every continent before her 15th birthday, in a tribute to him

The teenage turns 15 in December, and said after finishing her goal: 'It hasn't quite set in yet, I know that I've done something amazing here, but I can't really put into words how it feels yet, I guess the word is magical.'

She's now got her heart set on competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics as an aerial skier.

Winter will share the title of completing seven marathons around the globe with her mother though, who shared each moment with her.

The teen's mother, Dawn Estelle, said: 'It's been such a long and emotional journey, it's hard to comprehend the impact we've had on the world right now.'

The mother, daughter, duo have ticked off marathons in the United States (North America), Kenya (Africa), Antarctica, Mongolia (Asia), Peru (South America), New Zealand (Australia/Oceania) and Greece (Europe).

Winter said her favorite two locations were New Zealand and Antarctica, but her favorite two races were in Kenya and Peru.

In March this year, Winter became the youngest person ever to complete a marathon in Antarctica.

She braved temperatures of -25Cs (22 degrees Fahrenheit) during the race and finished 11th overall in the Antarctica Marathon and was the third female to finish with an impressive time of 4 hours 49 minutes.

After losing her dad, Winter set up Team Winter, a nonprofit organization to raise money for research into prostate cancer and awareness.

Winter began her charitable work in 
the six weeks after her father was diagnosed with sarcomatoid carcinoma 
of the prostate. He died after fighting the illness for ten months.

She has since raised around $400,000 using her skills as a triathlete.

She said: 'I'll do everything I can to put an end to prostate cancer and help find a cure, so other families don't have to endure the hardships that I faced.'

She previously ran the Eugene Marathon in North America and Amazing Measal Marathon in Africa.

Winter has signed up for some of the hardest races in the world including the Inca Trail in Machu Picchu, Peru, and the original Pheidippides run from Marathon to Athens, Greece.

In New Zealand she completed the Great Barrier Island Wharf to Wharf Marathon.

The young athlete is training four to five days a week for two or three hours per day to compete int he 2018 Winter Olympics as a qualified aerial skier.

She is also enrolled in Stanford University Online High School and studies Spanish, Advanced Placement Biology, geometry, history of science and English.

Winter says her races are much more than putting one foot in front of the other - they are also a great learning experience.

She said: 'At the Eugene Marathon, I treasured running in the footsteps of Steve Prefontaine - an athlete whose life was cut short.

'In Kenya I learned the true value of helping girls get an educate and in Antarctica I was given was the opportunity to learn and explore.

'The race ended up being maybe only ten per cent of this voyage, learning how we can preserve this continent was the remaining ninety per cent.'
