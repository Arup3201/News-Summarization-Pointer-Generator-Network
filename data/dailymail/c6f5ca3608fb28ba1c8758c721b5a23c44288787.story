A nine-year-old girl has been praised by police after grabbing the steering wheel and driving her family including her little sister to safety when her mother had a seizure in the driver's seat.

Jacey Jones, who is in the fourth grade, was traveling down a curvy road in Bay City, Michigan, with her younger sibling and mother, Samantha Jones, last September when the latter started fitting.

As Mrs Jones fell unconscious, Jacey, who was in the back seat of her family's Hyundai, climbed into the front and took hold of the wheel. She then drove the short distance to her school's parking lot.

There, she drove the car around in circles until she attracted the attention of a passing parent. The adult then opened the vehicle's door and put it in park, before lifting the girls out and calling 911.

Mrs Jones was rushed to hospital, where she awoke a few hours later to hear of Jacey's heroics. Meanwhile, her husband, Jeff, raced to the school, where he immediately spotted the Hyundai.

Incredibly, the dark-colored car had sustained only a smashed window and a torn-off panel in the incident. It later emerged it had crashed into several mailboxes en-route to the elementary school.

Now, Jacey, the eldest of four sisters, has been handed a Distinguished Citizens Award by Michigan state police for her actions, which Mrs Jones said likely saved her and her young daughters' lives.

Speaking to NBC 25, on Thursday, the mother-of-four said: 'I was just driving her to school like any other day and I, I woke up a few hours later in the hospital. I had a seizure while I was driving.'

She added: 'I didn't really believe it. My daughter was amazing. She saved us that morning'.

Jacey, who remains modest about her achievement, said she was 'really scared' when her mother suffered a seizure on Westside Saginaw Road while her little sister was sat in the passenger seat.

The fourth grader said that because she is used to taking charge of her sister and two other younger siblings when her mother is busy - such as when she is cooking dinner - she just leaped into action.

It is unknown why Mrs Jones suffered the seizure.

Award: Now, Jacey (pictured alongside two police officers) has been handed a Distinguished Citizens Award by Michigan state police for her actions, which Mrs Jones said likely saved her and her two daughters' lives
