A new series of Veet ads have been branded 'sexist' and 'wrong' for suggesting that women are manly if they don't wax their body hair.

The U.S. commercials are part of a campaign with the tagline 'Don't risk dudeness', and they each show a hairy and overweight man playing the role of a woman who has suddenly realized she has body hair even though she 'shaved yesterday'.

In one of the ads, a women stretches her leg over her boyfriend in bed. He strokes it, suddenly realizing it is stubbly, and the person he thought was his girlfriend is revealed as a man.

Misogynistic: A new series of Veet ads have been branded 'sexist' and 'wrong' for suggesting that women risk being manly if they don't wax their body hair

Shaming: In one of the ads, a man strokes his girlfriend's leg and is disgusted to realize it's stubbly. 'Yeah, I know, I'm a little prickly,' says the girlfriend, who is played by a hair male actor

'Yeah, I know, I'm a little prickly,' the actor says in a woman's voice-over. 'I shaved yesterday...'

Criticism has poured in since the ads first aired in the U.S. on Monday, with viewers branding them 'sexist', 'asinine' and 'shameful'.

'Well, I won't be buying #veet products after that commercial,' tweeted one woman. 'Shaving my
 legs is my choice and not doing so does not make me manly.'

Another wrote: 'Shame on you #veet for preying on the insecurities of women and reinforcing false ideas of femininity.'

Body hair emergency: Another ad features a woman lying on a stretcher in an ambulance. As an EMT cuts open her jeans, she pleads: 'Please, not the panties'

Backlash: A horrified viewer commented: 'The takeaway here is that women should feel ashamed of their own natural bodies, even in an emergency situation? This is the most sickening ad I've ever seen'

Even men were appalled by the sexist message behind the videos, with one tweeting: 'If I were a woman, I would start growing my body hair out in protest. What an asinine commercial series.'

Each ad in the series implies that a woman should be ashamed and embarrassed by her body hair - whether it's on her legs, armpits or bikini line.

One of them shows a woman hailing a taxi, which pulls up to her, the driver grinning until he notices her hairy underarms. 'S***, I shaved yesterday,' she says, and the driver winces and pulls away.

Sexism: Another video shows a pretty woman hailing a taxi, which pulls up to her, the driver grinning

Judgmental: But then the driver winces as he notices her hairy underarms. 'S***, I shaved yesterday,' she says, and he drives away

A third video from the campaign 
features a woman who has been in an accident and is lying on a stretcher
 in an ambulance. As an EMT cuts open her jeans, she pleads: 'Please, 
not the panties.'

A disgusted viewer commented on the video: 'The takeaway here is that women should feel ashamed of their own natural bodies, even in an emergency situation?

'This is the most sickening ad I've ever seen,' she concluded.

Exposed: In the fourth ad, a woman has a pedicure, and the salon employee begins rolling up her trousers

Gender stereotype: But the woman morphs into a man when the pedicurist sees her unshaven legs, shouting with disgust: 'Oh this is terrible! Terrible!'

And in the fourth ad, a woman sits down to have a pedicure, but the salon employee appears disgusted by her unshaven legs, shouting: 'Oh this is terrible! Terrible!'

The videos call to mind vintage commercials with the antiquated message of encouraging women to use deodorant and other products with the sole purpose of appealing themselves to men.

A spokesman for Veet said the adverts, which have only been aired in North America, were not intended to offend, but that the company has decided to axe the campaign.

She said: 'While the current advertising campaign for VEET running in the USA has been well received by most consumers who appreciate its wacky, tongue in cheek humour, it has also provoked a great deal of comment. 

'We take our responsibilities very seriously and the ad was carefully reviewed before it aired.  However we are very concerned by any misinterpretation of its tone or meaning, and in the light of the feedback received we have decided to withdraw it. 

'We would also like to apologise for any offense it may have caused. That was certainly not our intention.'

The Veet ads call to mind vintage commercials that suggested women should use products like deodorant for the sole purpose of attracting men.

Indeed, deodorant was not widely used until around 1919, when James Young, a copywriter for Odorono - one of the original brands of deodorant - created an ad that changed attitudes to sweating and body odor.

Until then, the public did not see the need for deodorant, since underarm sweat was not viewed as a social faux pas. In fact, it was commonly believed that blocking perspiration was unhealthy.

So in his copy, he presented 'excessive perspiration' as a source of embarrassment:

A woman’s arm! Poets have sung of its grace; artists have painted its beauty. It should be the daintiest, sweetest thing in the world. And yet, unfortunately, it isn’t always. 

Many a woman who says, ‘No, I am never annoyed by perspiration,’ does not know the facts – does not realize how much sweeter and daintier she would be if she were entirely free from it.
