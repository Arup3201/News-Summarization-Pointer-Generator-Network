She shimmied, she bopped – and of course, she swung her famous derriere to the beat of the music.

This is Pippa Middleton strutting her stuff on a dancefloor as she relaxed with friends in the luxury Swiss ski resort of Gstaad.

Perhaps what she didn’t expect was an unorthodox move from the chap alongside her as he swept in to steal a kiss.

Cheeky: Pippa laughs as her friend appears to lean in for a kiss on the cheek at the Swiss ski resort in Gstaad

Grainy footage posted on the internet shows him apparently planting one on our future queen’s little sister as she enjoyed herself at a disco with some cringe-makingly dreadful dance moves.

The film was taken at the Palace hotel in Gstaad, where Pippa and her boyfriend Nico Jackson earlier had box seats to watch a match in the Hublot Polo Gold Cup Tournament, a celebrated magnet for the fabulously rich and famous.

Yesterday the video was generating interest from around the world as various websites posted links to it, including one that raised the intriguing question: ‘Do you think Pippa has the best boudjies in the business?’

Pippa, 31 next month and looking curvy in an £800 Matthew Williamson dress, is captured doing some 80s-style, finger-pointing moves to raucous music when the unidentified male comes into view on the dancefloor beside her.

Whether he successfully gives her a kiss on the cheek, or simply leans forward to shout in her ear above the cacophony, is uncertain. The surprised reaction of a blonde dance companion alongside Pippa, however, might seem to suggest the former.

Pippa was in the trendy resort with Mr Jackson, a grammar school educated stockbroker who has a home in Geneva. They were earlier pictured chatting happily and walking hand in hand around town and at the polo.

The couple were recently reported to have been house-hunting in South London after Mr Jackson sold his £1.56million flat in Kensington.

It’s enough to make Homer eat his shorts – but the Duchess of Cambridge has just been ‘Simpsonized’. Italian blog artist and satirist Alexsandro Palombo has released cartoon images of Kate in a succession of poses based on the popular Simpsons TV series. She is shown, Marge-style, against a backdrop of various royal locations – including some with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, and wearing various outfits based on real life.
