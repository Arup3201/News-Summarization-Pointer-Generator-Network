The London Paralympic Games are expected to be the greatest ever celebration of sporting achievement by disabled athletes.

But many feel it will also provide a golden opportunity to change attitudes about disability away from the competitive limelight.

One of those is Priscilla Sutton, the curator of a pioneering exhibition called Spare Parts that uses prostethic limbs as the focal point of its art.

'We're not bionic machines': Amputee Priscilla Sutton arranges pieces for her exhibition Spare Parts, which turns prostethic limbs into art

Priscilla says she is a 'much more confident woman' since becoming an amputee in 2005 and hopes the Games will challenge people's perceptions about how the human body is supposed to look.

'There is still a taboo around about prosthetics and many people aren't sure if they should talk about them or look at them,' she told HuffPost Lifestyle.

'Amputees are just like everyone else, but just happen to have a part of their body missing. We're not scary and we are not bionic machines.'

Breaking a taboo: Priscilla hopes the Paralympics will capture the spirit of her exhibition by changing people's attitudes about body parts

Pushing the boundaries: Priscilla says she felt far sexier after having her leg removed because she finally could wear the clothes she wanted

Priscilla had suffered from a worsening bone condition which meant she wore orthopaedic boots with a build-up on one ankle.

As a result, she always wore long trousers or jeans and, in her words, didn't feel 'very sexy at all'.

So she took the decision to have her leg removed.

'After I chopped my leg off, I could wear "normal" shoes - and it felt so great!' she said. 'I had 26 years of shoe shopping to catch up on!'

Positive message: The exhibition which runs until September 9, comprises of over forty limbs donated by owners no longer using them and is being held to coincide with the London 2012 Paralympics

'Stump pride': Priscilla is keen to emphasise that women need to feel beautiful despite any disability they have

Priscilla, who has also started wearing dresses since losing her limb, has coined the term 'stump pride' as she looks to build a positive image about being an amputee.

'Especially as a woman. You need to feel beautiful and take care of yourself,' she said.

The Paralympics, which begins with the opening ceremony on Wednesday, has already sold a record 2.3 million tickets and has been billed by Prime Minister David Cameron as the 'best, the biggest, the most incredible Paralympic Games ever.'

Spare Parts will be held at The Rag Factory, London from today until September 9.
