Benefit fraudster Dawn Pearson outside Neath Magistrates Court at an earlier hearing

A clairvoyant who failed to foresee a conviction for benefit fraud  has been ordered to pay back every penny of £33,000 she illegally claimed.

Self-styled Tarot reader and fortune-teller Dawn Pearson, 50, was uncovered as a benefits cheat after investigators realised she was being paid to carry out psychic consultations over the phone, a court heard.

The
telephone charges were costing a fortune for her customers at £1.53 per
minute, while Pearson was claiming benefits for being too ill to work.

Prosecutor
Nuhu Gobir said: 'Fraud investigators from the Department of Work and 
Pensions began an investigation into her claim after information she was
working as a psychic.

'She denied she was in either full-time or part-time employment.'

The
court heard DWP officers contacted the Absolute Live company where 
Pearson was working as a psychic reader and a sex chat-line operator.

Mr Gobir said: 'They were unable to provide a breakdown of her hours but records showed she was paid £600 a month at some stage.

'Investigators retrieved her bank statements to show payments from the Absolute Live company.

'Another company Selcast UK Ltd said she had worked on a self-employed basis as a tarot card reader and as a webcame psychic.'

The
court heard Pearson unlawfully claimed a total of £33,206.82 in income 
support, jobseekers allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit 
over 16 months.

But at the same time she was advertising herself as a chat line clairvoyant on the Psychic TV website.

On
the website, Pearson is pictured next to the description: 'Dawn is an 
excellent Psychic clairvoyant, with many years experience.

'She uses her cards and crystals, and also her spirit guides to get a link with you.

'She is a trained Reiki healer and has been using all of her gifts to help people for many years.

'Dawn
will happily discuss any pressing relationship or career questions, but
can also give general guidance on self-development using her training 
as a life coach.'

Pearson 
appeared in Swansea Crown Court to admit four charges of benefits fraud 
by claiming to be 'unable to work due to illness and disability.'

Frank Phillips, defending, told the court that Pearson's claim had started out as legitimate.

He
said financial problems arose because she had been the sole carer for 
her father and an aunt who both died within a short time of each other.

She had been left to pay their funeral costs and had helped out another family member struggling to pay large catalogue debts.

'As time went on she buried her head in the sand and became afraid of informing the authorities,' he said.

He added that she had been under 'much trauma' as a result but had now already repaid £600 and was repaying £114 a month.

Pearson, of Neath, South Wales, was given a 12-week suspended jailed sentence and ordered to do 180 hours of unpaid work.

She stood in court with her head bowed today as she listened to the judge passing sentence.

After the hearing she left court with her face hidden behind an umbrella, despite the absence of rain.

Asked if she had foreseen what would happen to her she replied: 'I don't know. No. No comment.'

She had complained that press coverage had been bad for business in a pre sentence report.

Recorder Christopher Clee QC said: 'You claim that you have been ridiculed in the press 
and, as a result of which, work has diminished, and that is no great 
surprise.'

He ordered her to pay back all the money to the taxpayer.

He said: 'You’ve already paid back some and it will take you very many years to pay it all back.

'You richly deserve an immediate 
prison sentence and the great majority of the British public who work 
and pay taxes to benefits cheats like yourself would demand a prison 
sentence.

'But I have to work within guidelines. Your sentence will be suspended instead.

'Unpaid work will mean you putting 
something back into the community instead of taking out which is what 
you did for five years.'

After the case, DWP Minister for 
Welfare Reform Lord Freud said: 'It’s cases like these that show us why 
welfare reform is needed.

'We have a duty to the taxpayer to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them.

'Benefit fraud takes money away from the most vulnerable.

'It is a crime and we are committed to
stopping it by catching criminals at the front line and making sure our
reforms make the benefit system less open to abuse.'
