Cocaine death: Shruti Baral,  originally from Hong Kong, had not been in the habit of taking drugs

A mother who supplied a Class A drug used by a student to commit suicide has avoided jail.

Francesca Davies, 22, of Maidstone, Kent, gave Shruti Baral an amount of cocaine the day before she was found dead in her bedroom by her teenage brother.

Miss Baral, also 22, who was originally from Hong Kong, had not been in the habit of taking drugs, an earlier inquest heard.

Davies admitted being concerned in supplying the cocaine. Police officers went with a warrant for her at other addresses in the town but she made contact in June.

The Hilton hotel worker had obtained the drug for Miss Baral from a boyfriend, who was a drug dealer, Maidstone Crown Court was told.

Judge David Griffith-Jones QC stressed there was no suggestion Davies knew of Miss Baral’s plan to kill herself in February last year.

He said: ‘I don’t treat Miss Baral’s sad demise as an aggravating feature. You are a young woman of previous good character.

‘I am satisfied it is appropriate to regard this as something of an aberration - something that was quite out of character for you. I accept your remorse is genuine and there is a low risk of re-offending. 

'While I take the view a prison sentence is demanded given the seriousness of the offence, mitigation and the effect your immediate incarceration would have on your very young child lead me to say it can be properly suspended.’

Education: Miss Baral, who died last year, was a former pupil of Invicta Grammar School in Maidstone, Kent

Giving Davies an 18-month prison term suspended for two years with 200 hours of unpaid work, the judge added: ‘You have escaped immediate imprisonment today, but you are not out of the woods.

‘I very much hope you do not let me down and find yourself back here for breaching requirements.’

At Miss Baral’s inquest in August 2013, coroner Patricia Harding recorded a verdict of suicide. Miss Baral was a former pupil at Invicta Grammar School in Maidstone.
