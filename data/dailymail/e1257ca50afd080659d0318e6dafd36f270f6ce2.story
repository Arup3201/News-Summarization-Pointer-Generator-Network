Frank Lampard has taken advantage of the international break to check out properties in Manhattan with his fiancee Christine Bleakley ahead of his move to New York City in July. 

The couple are reportedly interested in a 9,000 sq ft apartment in the Big Apple, which would cost them an incredible £64,000 ($95,000) per month.  

Lampard and Bleakley flew to New York for the weekend where they watched his new team take on Sporting Kansas City on Saturday night at Yankee stadium.

The apartment also comes with 5,300 sq ft of outdoor terraces which give sweeping views over the city 

The MLS new boys couldn't put on a show for their soon-to-arrive designated player and Bleakley on Saturday night as they crashed to their first defeat of the season against the visitors from Kansas.

Lampard has spent the season at Manchester City after agreeing his Stateside move last summer, but the half-season 'loan' to the Premier League champions caused controversy when it was revealed that the midfielder had instead signed for the entire campaign in England, making him miss the MLS' start. 

It was reported that Lampard could have even headed to New York for good this month after finding it difficult to break back into Manuel Pellegrini's side, but that now seems unlikely.
