Home Secretary Theresa May

A man has been arrested and bailed over a cyber attack on the websites of the Home Office and the Home Secretary, Scotland Yard said.

The 41-year-old man, who has not been named, was held today at his home in Stoke-on-Trent on suspicion of encouraging a distributed denial of service (Ddos) attack on the sites.

He allegedly targeted the Home Office and Theresa Mayâ€™s constituency websites and urged others to take part in the attack online.

Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to overwhelm websites so they crash.

The man was arrested on suspicion of assisting or encouraging crime contrary to the Serious Crime Act 2007 and later bailed until mid-December.

Scotland Yard said material including computers, telephones and media storage devices were seized from his home.

Detective Inspector Jason Tunn said: 'Assisting and encouraging cyber crime is a serious matter and I would advise all persons to consider their actions and any possible future consequences prior to posting any material online.'

The attacks are said to date back to June of this year.

It is not the first time government websites have come under attack.

Back in April, people claiming to be members of the hacking group Anonymous claimed to have launched a co-ordinated attack on four government websites, including the Home Office site, in protest at extraditions of Brits to face trials in America, and plans to allow the increased monitoring of web use and phone calls.
