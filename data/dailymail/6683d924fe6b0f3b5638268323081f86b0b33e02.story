Two teenagers have been accused of torturing a 17-year-old boy in a cellar by sexually assaulting him and putting concrete in his eyes.

The pair, aged 16 and 17, are alleged to have taken the teenage victim to the cellar in Gloucester before subjecting him to a brutal violent and sexual attack.

It is alleged that they sexually assaulted
the victim with a length of wood, beat him and forced him to perform a 
sex act on them before filling his eyes with concrete.

Horrific: Two teenagers have been accused of torturing a 17-year-old boy in a cellar by sexually assaulting him and putting concrete in his eyes. The case was heard at Cheltenham Youth Court

Police have arrested the two youths on suspicion of raping the victim in Barton on November 7 last year. They have now been released on bail.Â 

Details were revealed at Cheltenham Youth Court when the 16 year old defendant denied witness intimidation and using threatening words or behaviour in charges linked to the case.

He also admitted assault as part of an investigation into a separate case.

Speaking at court, prosecutor Peter Ashby said: 'Two males took the male victim to a cellar in Gloucester.'

Magistrates granted the 16 year old bail but he must not enter Gloucester unless for pre-arranged legal appointments.

Both the accused are expected to answer police bail on April 3 on the rape allegation.

The 16 year old's not guilty pleas to the charges of witness intimidation and using threatening words or behaviour will be considered at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court the next day, along with a pre-sentence report on the charge of assault which the boy has admitted.

Gloucestershire Constabulary confirmed it has bailed the two boys, aged 16 and 17, to April 3.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
