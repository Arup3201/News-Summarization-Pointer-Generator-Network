A conman wore a stethoscope and white coat to pose as a doctor and sexually abuse six women patients, a court heard today.

Antonio Gobbato, who said he was a doctor working for the NHS, claimed he was diagnosing the women by fondling their breasts, a court was told.

He also posed as a gynaecologist, paediatrician and a psychiatrist and had fake certificates and microscopes to fool the women at various premises across London, it is alleged.

From August 2009 he ran surgeries from his home in Pinner, north-west London, then at a beautician’s in Whitechapel, east London before borrowing a doctor’s surgery in Kilburn and finally setting up in south London.

Gobbato, 51, also allegedly tricked parents into paying for expensive treatments abroad for their children so he could enjoy all-inclusive holidays.

In reality, the fake GP had little or no qualifications, the jury heard.

Prosecutor Linda Strudwick told Inner London Crown Court: 'Antonio Gobbato is a charlatan and a make believe doctor.'

During the ten month con he he convinced six women to strip off and fondled their private parts 'under the guise of medical examinations', the court heard.

He lied to three separate parents that their children were suffering with serious illnesses - including potential leukaemia - in an attempt to trick them into taking him to Italy, it is said.

Ms Strudwick said: 'Whatever qualifications he did have, and even these are questioned, they were not as a medical doctor, whether in traditional western medicine or complementary medicine.

'However, he called himself Doctor Gobbato.

'Furthermore, he gave every impression to his patients that he was a qualified medical doctor.

'He wore a typical doctor’s coat with Dr Gobbato embroidered on the pocket and a stethoscope was worn around his neck in the consulting rooms along with medical paraphernalia and framed certificates.

'He referred to himself as a GP and he acted at all times as though he were qualified and able to make diagnoses of serious illnesses when he had no such training or ability.'

The Brazilian-born fraudster registered using fake documents with the Complementary Medical Association claiming he was a doctor and had qualified in Portugal in massage, homeopathy and herbal medicines, it is alleged.

He then 'very cleverly' used his £150 membership, which was granted because the CMA trusted him and no-one could speak Portuguese, to get further certification, Ms Strudwick said.

She said: 'Gobbato portrayed himself as a qualified doctor, with the skill and expertise to diagnose, that tricked the women who came to him into their removing their clothes and allowing him to examine them and parents into believing him when he told them that their children were seriously ill.'

He targeted women from his homeland who were 'ripe for exploitation', trusted him as he spoke their language, and were sometimes illegally in the UK unable to get NHS registration.

He used tricks including claiming to work for the NHS and used a microscope to look at blood and make 'nonsense' diagnoses.

It was also said that he surrounded himself with paraphernalia such as business cards calling himself Dr Gobbato and a CV listing fake jobs in an attempt to back up his lies.

One woman who complained of liver problems had her breast fondled on the pretence he was looking for 'nodules and hormones' and she even paid a consultation fee in the belief the treatment was genuine.

In others cases he made 'terrifying statements' to persuade parents to let him accompany their children to Italy for treatment, it is claimed.

Gobbato denies seven counts of sexual assault, two attempted frauds and one fraud.

The case continues.
