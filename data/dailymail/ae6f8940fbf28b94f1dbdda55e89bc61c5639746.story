A campaign to raise money for a baby girl set to lose all her limbs to meningitis has raised £20,000 in just two weeks.

Harmonie-Rose Allen suffered one of the worst cases of the deadly illness doctors have seen and was put on life-support.

Despite being given just a 10 per cent chance of survival she recovered - but will soon undergo an operation to amputate both her arms and legs.

A campaign to raise money for the 11-month-old  - who is set to lose all her limbs to meningitis - has raised £20,000 in just two weeks

Her Parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen organised a 5km fun run in aid of Harmonie. It was expected to attract just 20 people - but 350 have signed up for it

Discussions on when Harmonie should have the operation to amputate both her arms and legs will take place this week 

The Hope for Harmonie campaign, led by parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen has proved enormously successful, raising £20,000 in just two weeks.

This is half of the £40,000 they need for prosthetic limbs that will allow her to live as normal as life as possible.

A planned 5km fun run in aid of Harmonie was expected to attract just 20 people - but 350 have signed up for it.

Discussions on when Harmonie, from Bath, Somerset, will have all four of her limbs amputated are set to take place this week.

She will need two pairs of prosthetics, as well as home modifications and specialised equipment.

She remains in hospital where she is off life-support and being fed through a feeding tube, building up strength for the operation.

Ms Hall and Mr Allen are constantly at her side and have started giving her small mouthfuls of food.

Her aunt, Hannah Hall, said: 'The money will all be for Harmonie through her lifetime, items that are not available on the NHS.

'This gives Harmonie the life that all children deserve. One day, we will all observe Harmonie take those first long awaited steps on prosthetic legs.

'This is an amazing achievement. Keep praying, keep believing, keep supporting us. This is something we can all achieve together.'

Harmonie was first rushed to hospital on September 27 when Harmonie woke in the night coughing and unable to breathe.

Her parents took her to the Royal United Hospital in Bath but doctors could not find anything seriously wrong and she was sent home.

After she turned blue the next morning they took her back to the same hospital.

Following a thorough assessment they were told it was just a virus and were again sent home.

But hours later she became floppy and lethargic and they rushed back to the hospital, where a rash was spotted.

She was then rushed by ambulance to specialist unit at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.

By the time she arrived at the intensive care unit her arms and legs had turned black and her parents were told all four limbs would need to be amputated.

Mr Allen said: 'She was really lucky to survive.

'Doctors told us it was the worst case they had seen in three years and they really didn't think she would make the journey to the hospital. She's a little fighter.'

The Meningitis Research Foundation estimates there are around 3,200 cases of meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK.

They are easily mistaken for milder illnesses, but unlike a dose of flu can kill within hours and may cause serious, life-long disabilities.

As many as one in ten of those affected will die and a third of survivors will be left with after-effects, some as serious as brain damage, amputations, blindness and hearing loss.

Vaccines have almost eliminated some types of meningitis but not all of them children are currently vaccinated against Hib, MenC and 13 strains of pneumococcal meningitis.

A MenB vaccine (Bexsero) was recommended for infants in the UK in March 2014 and is available privately but a timetable for implementation free of charge on the NHS is yet to be confirmed.

The UK Government has also introduced a new MenC booster campaign aimed at students starting university.

GPs can administer the vaccine free of charge until 31 October 2014. The booster campaign will be repeated every year until 2017.
