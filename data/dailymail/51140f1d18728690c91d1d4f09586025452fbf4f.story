This bundle of joy arrived on time, exactly.

Nicollette Brynn Anders was born in Missoula, Montana, on 11/12/13 at 2.15pm – which, in military time, is 14.15pm. Her overjoyed parents only realized the coincidence after days of mother Amanda being in labor.

‘The 11-12-13 we knew, but it wasn’t until 10 minutes before she came that we realized we could possibly have a 14.15,’ Amanda Anders told The Missoulian.

A doctor induced labor six days before Mrs Anders gave birth, she recalled, adding that they were aware of the possibility, but didn't think about it until the big day.

The rest was soon history, and the Anders family had a nine pound, three ounce, 20.5 inches-long addition.

‘That’s just when she happened to come,’ new father Mark Anders told the paper. ‘It wasn’t planned.’

A handful of other 11/12/13 14.15 babies were born across the U.S., the Missoulian noted. 

After next year, on 12/13/14, there will be no sequential dates again until January 2, 2103.
