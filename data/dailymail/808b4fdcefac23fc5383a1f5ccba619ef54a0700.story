Just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling allowing same-sex marriage in five states Monday, a lesbian Virginia couple made history with their wedding being the first in the Commonwealth of Virginia. 

Erika Turner and Jennifer Melsop, of Centreville, (both 26 years old) married on the courthouse steps in Arlington, Virginia less than two hours after the courts began issuing licenses, the Associated Press reports.

The two told ABC News that they had expected a long line of eager same-sex couples waiting to be married when they reached the courthouse.

Expectations: The couple said they expected a long line of eager same-sex couples waiting to be married when they reached the court house

Overwhelming: The newlyweds told ABC News that they didn't know they were the first to be married following the Supreme Courts ruling and it was 'a little overwhelming'

Instead, the couple was met with television cameras, same-sex advocates offering to pay their marriage license fee, and the minister of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Arlington offering to perform the ceremony, according to the Associated Press.

Cameras flashed as the couple each held a red rose given to them by a circuit court clerk and said their 'I dos.' 

'Dearly beloved we have gathered together to join this woman and this woman in the holy state of matrimony,' the minister said as the ceremony began.

'...You are changing history. Your families are coming together and the course of the world will be different because you now are a new family.'

Kiss the bride: The two exchanged rings before being announced 'wife and wife' and sharing a kiss

Opportunity: Turner told reporters that she and Melsop had been trying to get married in other states but couldn't pass up the opportunity to get married in their own

Engagement: Tuner (a registered nurse) proposed marriage to Melsop (a veterinarian's assistant) a year ago

With jitters, the two exchanged rings before being announced 'wife and wife' and sharing a kiss.

The newlyweds told ABC News that they didn't know they were the first to be married following the Supreme Courts ruling and it was 'a little overwhelming.'  

Tuner (a registered nurse) told USA that she proposed marriage to Melsop (a veterinarian's assistant) a year ago.

'We've been trying to figure out how to plan a wedding in other states,' Turner told reporters after the ceremony. 'So we can't pass up an opportunity to marry in our own state.'

USA Today reports that the when the Supreme Court made its ruling Monday, officials decided to hold a press conference at the courthouse. 

Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring reportedly described the decision as 'a tremendous moment in Virginia history.' 

This wedding has been among the first of many since the Supreme Court ruled Monday to let stand rulings allowing same-sex marriage in Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, Indiana and Wisconsin.

The high court's refusal -- without explanation -- to hear gay marriage appeals left standing rulings that legalize the practice. 

This decision, though it immediately effected the five states, will most likely go on to include Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina -- bringing the total number of states where gay couples may marry to 30, The Washington Post reports.

Reuters reports that Evan Wolfson, head of the Freedom to Marry group, said that though the Supreme Court's action was a productive step in the gay marriage movement, gay rights advocates want the court to provide a more definite ruling. 

'The Supreme Court should bring the country to a nationwide resolution,' Wolfson said.
