Shocking footage of a burning firebomb being launched at former celebrity photographer Darryn Lyons’ nightclub has been revealed, as he claims he has repeatedly come under 'attack' since becoming the mayor of his hometown.

The one-time Celebrity Big Brother contestant, famous for pink hair and enhanced abs, was elected the 95th mayor of Geelong, in Victoria, on 23 November 2013 but Cr Lyons told the Herald Sun that since then there have 'been various issues'.

In the CCTV footage, a man in a white hoody can be seen grabbing the jerry can bomb from the boot of a car parked outside the nightclub. But the bomb goes up in flames on the street after being thrown at the window of the building and lands on the street.

Mayor of Geelong Darryn Lyons (right), seen here with Prime Minister Tony Abbott, says he has become the target of attacks 

Describing the attack at his Home House nightclub on Moorabool Street on June 26, Cr Lyons said it could have claimed lives. 

'There was no doubt it was a targeted attack. There have been various issues, stuff at home that has caused concern. This was the most serious of the targeted attacks on the mayor,' Cr Lyons told the Herald.

Cr Lyons is appealing for help to catch the culprits after police revealed five litres of high-octane Nitro-X fuel, which is only sold at three stores in Victoria, was found at the scene.

A Victoria Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Police are investigating a suspicious fire at a Geelong nightclub.

'This happened on 26 June. The blaze caused damage to the footpath and front façade of the building. Detectives are still looking into it.'

The 48-year-old  won the Mayoral post in Geelong last year, taking 29.9 per cent of the primary vote.

The Liberal party member took 70,795 votes after preferences, ahead of his nearest challenger Stephanie Asher by more than 12,600 votes.

When he announced his intention to run in the Australian state of Victoria he said he had learned from his time living in Britain that 'every election needs a comedy candidate,' reported The Age.

His campaign slogan was 'vision, passion and change,' and he publicised his message with adverts, T-shirts, and a stream of public appearances. Mr Lyons was victorious despite the fact he has lived in Europe for several decades - he arrived in London aged 22.

In 1992, Lyons founded picture agency Big Pictures, later gaining notoriety for selling a photograph of David Beckham and Rebecca Loos to the News Of The World.

In 2011 he appeared on the UK Celebrity Big Brother during which time bragged of his bedroom antics with a series of famous faces.

He even claimed to having spent the night with 12 girls at the same time.

The paparazzo told model Bobby Sabel: 'I once shared a bed with 12 girls. Those were the crazy days.'

On the Channel Five programme in which he came in sixth place, he also debuted his surgically-sculpted six pack.

The £4,000 procedure sees fat sucked out of specific areas of the torso to make it look as if the patient has super-toned abdominal muscles without ever hitting the gym.

Talking about the procedure, Mr Lyons said: 'I had contouring done to my body.

'I had to get really fit and lose a fair bit of weight. It takes away all the fat around it and actually lets your natural abs be there.

'Basically it's the male version of a boob job.'
