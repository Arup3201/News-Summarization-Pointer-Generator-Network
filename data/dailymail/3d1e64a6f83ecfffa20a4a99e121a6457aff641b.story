The rush to buy powerful vacuum cleaners before an EU ban has been a major boost for the High Street, official figures revealed yesterday.

Sales of household goods soared by 12.7 per cent last month compared with August last year. It is the largest annual increase since 2001.

In electrical appliance stores alone, sales were 10.3 per cent higher than in 2013, and the amount spent rose by 6.4 per cent. The Office for National Statistics said the surge had been partly caused by the stampede to buy high-powered vacuum cleaners.

The rush, in which some retailers reported a fourfold leap in vacuum sales, came after the Mail highlighted the EU’s impending ban – and offered readers an exclusive discount on top Hoover models.

The EU directive, which came into effect on September 1, banned cleaners of more than 1,600 watts in a bid to reduce energy consumption. This will be lowered even further to 900 watts by 2017.

Kate Davies, of the ONS’s retail sales index, said: ‘August is usually a quiet month but the feedback we are getting from retailers is that the rise in electrical stores was very much down to vacuum cleaners.’

The Co-operative Electrical shop said sales of vacuum cleaners rose by 60 per cent between July and August this year. A spokesman said: ‘Vacuum cleaners were a big-selling item last month.

‘We have also seen an increase in the sale of vacuum cleaners year over the last twelve months, which are up 20 per cent since August 2013. This has been one of the drivers behind a successful year.’

Furniture sales also drove up business for household goods stores last month, rocketing by 23.4 per cent – the largest annual increase since records began in 1988.

Analysts attributed the boom to the healthy property market, as many Britons look to redecorate their new homes. Alan Clarke, a strategist at Scotiabank, said: ‘Household goods sales are posting double digit annual growth.

‘That is probably no surprise in an environment of rapid house price inflation, where people feel inclined to splash out or those moving house buy new appliances.’

Across the entire retail industry, sales were up by 3.9 per cent in August compared with last year, and the total amount spent also rose by 2.7 per cent.

But while sales and spending increased, stores dropped their prices by 1.2 per cent, the largest fall since July 2009.

Prices in food shops fell for the first time since December 2004, dropping by 0.1 per cent over the year, which the ONS said was ‘in part due to “supermarket price wars”.’

Helal Miah, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said sales figures had benefited from ‘benign weather conditions and the one off impetus of a rush to buy powerful vacuum cleaners’.

He added that the figures show ‘consumer spending remains fairly robust’, despite a lack of wage rises. This week, ONS figures showed workers received the worst annual pay rises on record for a third consecutive month. The average salary increased by just 0.7 per cent, less than half the current rate of inflation at 1.5 per cent.
