A former Page Three girl was among the protesters who blocked a rural drilling site earmarked for fracking yesterday.

Marina Pepper, 45, said the action in Balcombe was a ‘wake-up call’ to other areas that might be affected by fracking.

Now a local councillor, the one-time Playboy model who had a six-month affair with Bond star Daniel Craig 25 years ago, said: ‘For many people it is their first time coming out to protest.

‘They had early success because they stopped lorries going in, therefore there was a sense that people coming together can actually change the world.

'It’s our environment that’s being affected and our drinking water.’

Mrs Pepper was a Liberal Democrat councillor until 2011 in Telscombe, East Sussex. 

She stood (unsuccessfully) in the 2005 General Election for Brighton Kemptown.

Police said the arrests were made to 'ensure public safety' and came after talks failed

Villagers blocking the rural drilling site earmarked for fracking were dragged away by police yesterday as protests turned ugly.

Around a hundred police – including trained riot officers –  were brought in to break up the blockade which was in its second day in the West Sussex countryside near Balcombe.

The site, which has been selected for exploratory drilling by fracking company Cuadrilla, has attracted a growing number of protesters all week who until yesterday  morning had managed to block all access from the road. 

But Sussex Police confirmed that 16 protesters had been arrested after they sat on logs across the entrance and refused to move.

Of those, 12 were charged today and 
will appear at court next month. Those charged include two teenage boys,
a circus worker, a charity worker, a teacher and a writer. Their ages 
range from 15 to 51 years old.

Anti-fracking campaigners had gathered yesterday for a second day in the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, where Cuadrilla is poised to start test drilling

All those charged have have been dealt with under Section 241 of the 
Trade Union Labour Relations Act for attempting to stop drivers and 
other workers from accessing the site.

One 37-year-old protester, Michael Atkins, from Westbury, Wiltshire, was also charged with assault on police.

A further two women were arrested at continuing protests today, one for assault on police and the other under the Trade Union Labour Relations Act.

Some activists described the police response as 'disproportionate' but police insist all the arrests were made peacefully.

Cuadrilla said obstacles blocking the road have now been removed and delivery of equipment has resumed. It hopes to start drilling 'as soon as is reasonably possible'.

The company has said it intends only to conduct exploratory drilling in a temporary operation which will not include hydraulic fracturing.
