Fresh eurozone worries and turmoil in Egypt caused an end to the recent recovery in the FTSE 100 Index today as oil prices rose to a year-long high.

As well as political uncertainty in Egypt, stock market investors were spooked by disappointing data from the Chinese non-manufacturing sector and growing concerns over the future of Portugal's coalition government as it attempts to pursue the austerity measures demanded by creditors.

The FTSE 100 Index shed 1.2 per cent, closing down 74.1 points to 6229.9, amid growing concerns over the future of Portugal's coalition government as it attempts to pursue the austerity measures demanded by creditors.

Turmoil: Political uncertainty in Egypt, where thousands of opponents of President Morsi flooded the streets of Cairo yesterday, is being blamed for bringing the recent recovery in the FTSE 100 to an end

As well as political uncertainty in 
Egypt, investors were also spooked by disappointing data from the 
Chinese non-manufacturing sector.

But the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
on Wall Street edged moderately higher soon after opening following 
better-than-expected jobs data, which is seen as a precursor to Friday's
 key US employment report.

Today's fall on the FTSE 100 saw it 
lose some of the rebound seen in recent days after earlier losses 
triggered by credit crunch fears in China and the prospect of a tapering
 of economic stimulus measures in the US.

Egypt is not an oil producer but its 
control of the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, 
gives it a crucial role in global energy supplies.

The uncertain global outlook was 
reflected in the price of oil, with the New York listed price at its 
highest level in more than a year after a rise of more than two US 
dollars to around 102 US dollars a barrel.

Commodity-based stocks came under 
pressure, with Anglo American down more than 5%, or 65.75p at 1214.25p, 
Vedanta Resources 46.75p cheaper at 992.25p and BHP Billiton off 59.5p 
to 1651.5p.

Other big fallers included Barclays 
after the agency Standard & Poor's cut its long-term rating on the 
bank by one notch amid concerns about the impact of continued regulatory
 pressure.

Shares were down 8.3p at 274.7p, a fall of 3%, while elsewhere in the sector Standard Chartered was off 45.25p to 1418p.

Airline Flybe enjoyed a much-needed 
rally after it announced the appointment of easyJet's former chief 
commercial officer Saad Hammad as chief executive to replace long-term 
boss Jim French, who is to remain as chairman.

Shares jumped 7% or 3.5p to 50p as Mr
 French said the new boss, who will start work next month, brought a 'wealth of industry experience'.

Meanwhile, shares in Domino's Pizza 
slumped 7% despite a jump in like-for-like sales of 6.1% in the UK and 
Ireland for the 13 weeks to June 30.

The slide of 45.5p to 623.5p 
reflected the company's warning that losses from its fledgling operation
 in Germany will be up to £3 million more than originally thought as it 
switches corporate-run stores to franchisee management.

Portugal's financial markets nosedived today amid fears that repayments on its £64billion bailout could soon become unsustainable as the government looked set to collapse following a spat over the country's austerity programme.

Share prices dropped by around six per cent in early trading, alarming investors and reigniting concerns that the eurozone's strategy for dealing with the financial crisis is flawed.

The market dip came as Portuguese Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho defied calls to resign last night after the resignations of key ministers amid the austerity row.

Euro crisis: Fears over the future of Portugal's coalition government have also spooked investors, say experts

Impact: Political turmoil in Egypt - which controls the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes - also sent oil prices to their highest level in over a year

Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo 
Portas, the leader of the junior party in the center-right coalition 
government, quit on Tuesday in protest against plans to continue with 
tax hikes and pay and pension cuts. The previous day, Finance Minister 
Vitor Gaspar walked out, saying he lacked political and public support 
for his austerity strategy.

Portugal is locked into a program of 
tough budget cuts demanded by its fellow euro countries, the European 
Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund in return for a 78 
billion euro (£66 billion) bailout two years ago.

Leaders of the 17 European Union 
nations that share the euro currency, known as the eurozone, have 
insisted on cuts in countries like Portugal that have a heavy debt 
burden.
