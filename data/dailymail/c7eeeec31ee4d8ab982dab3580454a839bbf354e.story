Jonjo Shelvey was accused of ‘absolute madness’  after flinging an arm recklessly into the face of Emre Can during Liverpool’s emphatic victory over Swansea at Anfield.

Shelvey, who also scored an own goal in the 4-1 defeat to his old club, had already been warned about his discipline in the build-up to the game by Swansea boss Garry Monk who criticised the player’s ‘laziness’.

And he landed himself in more controversy by catching Can in the first half. Referee Andre Marriner was a few yards from the incident and decided not to award a freekick, but it remains to be seen if the FA take a different view. Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling may also be in hot water after he appeared to hit out at Federico Fernandez in the second half.

Shelvey’s former Anfield teammate Jamie Carragher criticised him afterwards, and revealed that such flashpoints were not uncommon at the club’s Melwood training ground when they were there.

‘It’s absolute madness,’ said Carragher. ‘You'd see this two or three times a week in training. He has bags of ability, Shelvey, but unfortunately he can do stuff like that too.’

Carragher’s fellow Sky TV pundit Gary Neville claimed that the offence was worse than the one that earned Liverpool’s Lazar Markovic a straight red card against Basle earlier this month.

'Garry Monk has already talked about the lack of discipline from Shelvey ahead of this game and this just proves it,’ said Neville. ‘When you first see it you can't really see it but on second viewing it is not pretty at all. He swings into Can.

‘The problem is the referee cannot put in his report that he hasn't seen that because he is never going to have a better view of it than he has there. It's not as bad as the Papiss Cisse one (elbow on Everton’s Seamus Coleman) but it is worse than the Markovic one we saw a few weeks ago.'

Despite Can going to ground complaining he had been struck, Shelvey escaped without punishment

Shelvey, who has already collected six yellow cards and a red this campaign, should escape retrospective punishment for this latest brush with trouble because Marriner saw the incident.

But it was just one more problem for Monk on a night when he had hoped to show his team could make a challenge for the European places.

Shelvey, who joined Swansea from Liverpool for £5million last year, was restored to the starting line-up last night. Monk admitted afterwards that he had not seen the incident but would look at it on the journey back to South Wales.

The Swansea boss might not be impressed if he sees footage of Shelvey joking with Liverpool’s Adam Lallana at a corner moments before heading into his own net.

‘I haven’t seen it,’ said Monk. ‘I’ve been asked that question already and I’ll have to look at it on the way home and judge it.

‘But I thought he played fantastic tonight, very good. That was the Jonjo that I know and he showed that quality with his passing.’

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers tried to play down both incidents involving Shelvey and Sterling.

‘I have seen the two,’ said Rodgers. ‘The cameras will probably show it a hundred times tomorrow and we will get bored of watching it.

‘Jonjo has flung his arm out and caught Emre on the side of his head. Young Raheem’s incident, the centre half has slapped him on the side of the head and he has put his hand up and slapped him on the side of the head.

‘I think the referee has called both right and got on with the game.’

Shelvey's evening got even worse when he scored an own goal as he flicked Jordan Henderson's corner past Lukasz Fabianski at the near post.

The own goal extinguished any hope Swansea had of getting back into the match as Liverpool opened up a three-goal lead with just 20 minutes to play.

Shelvey was marking Adam Lallana at the near post and was caught laughing and joking with the Liverpool midfielder prior to the corner being taken.

'I don't think Garry Monk will be too pleased with Shelvey (having a bit of a chuckle with Lallana) when you're losing,' Carragher said after the game.

'I never saw the benefit of laughing or smiling at an opposition player,' Neville added.

'I mean all it can be is a distraction. I can't see how it can work, particularly from a set piece. I don't think Garry Monk will be happy with it and in fact the only person it helped was Lallana.'
