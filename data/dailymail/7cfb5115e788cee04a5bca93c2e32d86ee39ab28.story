A grandfather is camping on a windswept seafront to make sure he heads the queue for a sought-after beach hut when it becomes available.

Keith Duell, 68, is already halfway through his six-day camp on Avon Beach in Christchurch, Dorset, wrapped in four layers of clothing to withstand the cold.

The grandfather hopes his hardy perseverance will secure the beach's only long-term let beach hut when it becomes available on Monday.

Waiting game: Keith Duell, 68, is queuing for six days on Avon Beach, near Christchurch, Dorset, to secure a beach hut. He is visited by wife Christine, 64,left, every day

Coveted: The sought-after beach huts at Avon Beach, one of which Mr Duell is keen to snap up when its lease becomes available on Monday

Mr Duell's motivation for the brave stint is to reward his wife of 43 years Christine, who has been unwell.

Indeed, his stakeout has been made all the more bearable by his wife who visits him every day bringing homemade soup.

Mr Duell, a former farmer from Burley, Hampshire, has also been visited by other family members in the evening who bring him dinner.

Holding tight: Mr Duell occupies himself by reading and conversing with passersby. He sits on a deckchair during the day before retiring to a one-man tent at night

During the day he sits in a deckchair 
and takes in the panoramic views of the ocean, before moving into a one-man 
tent and enduring near-freezing temperatures at night.

The coveted 6ft by 4ft hut will finally be available to book at 9am on Monday.

The couple will have to pay £850 for the lease, covering April to September, and will have priority for future rents until they choose to give it up.

Mr Duell said: 'My wife of 43 years hasn’t been very well so 
doing this is pay back time for her putting up with me for so long.

'I often fish in the bay and she comes and sits with me. This way if the weather is bad she can sit in the beach hut.

'Our grandchildren will love it as well, they often use the beach in the summer. The whole area is stunning.'

He added: 'Christine and I popped down 
here on New Year’s Day and I said that if there was nobody queueing the 
next day I would start.

'It was still the same the following day so I set up my tent. When I am in my tent I often hear people walk past and say things like ‘he must be mad.’

Gift: Mr Duell's inspiration for the six-day camp has been his wife Christine who has been unwell

'Everyone here has been so hospitable and really thoughtful. When you are here every day you get 
to see amazing scenes of nature.

'The foxes come along the beach at night
and I saw a seal in the sea the other morning.'

Mr Duell uses a nearby public 
toilet for washing facilities and entertains himself by reading books 
and chatting talking to passersby.

Wife Christine, 64, said: 'We didn’t know when to start queueing and wondered whether to leave it to the weekend. In the end I told him to come down.'

Another 17 long period lets will also be available this year but these huts must be renewed every year.
