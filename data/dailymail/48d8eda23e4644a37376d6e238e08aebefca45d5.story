Among the groups working to try and help keep the peace in under siege Ferguson, Missouri, are leather-clad motorcycle groups.

The bikers include members from groups including Outcast MC - America's oldest all-black motorcycle club - and Dominant Breed.

The riders arrived in town on Saturday and have been helping to protect stores against looters as well as joining in peaceful rallies protesting the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

One rider told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch over the weekend that the clubs don't have a specific strategy to help protect the city. 

‘But normally when they see our presence [troublemakers] don't come around much,’ he said. 

The bikers have also been spotted at a memorial site for the slain teen in recent days and their presence is widely considered to be having a positive impact.

Protesters and local residents have shared photos on social media of the bikers, wearing their signature black jackets and skull masks.

Outcast MC was founded in Detroit in 1969 and has chapters around the country.

The bikers aren't the only group on the streets of Ferguson working to restore order and support the peaceful protesters. 

Amnesty International and the Black Panther Party are among the other groups that currently have a presence in the town along with local student and church-based organizations. 

Funeral services for Brown, the black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer,  are planned for Monday.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Brown family said the exact time and location for the memorial has not been finalized.

The shooting of the unarmed Brown by officer Darren Wilson has stoked more than a week of unrest in the city. 

Police have used tear gas, sound projectors and other means to turn back demonstrators, some of whom have lobbed Molotov cocktails and bottles at officers.

The volatile scenes prompted Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to deploy the National Guard in an effort control the unrest.
