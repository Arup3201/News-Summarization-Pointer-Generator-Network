CBS has responded to the growing controversy over racist and homophobic statements made by several 'Big Brother' contestants that were captured on the reality show's live Internet feed.

Every program now comes with a written warning from the network.

CBS had already distanced itself by making a statement about the prejudicial views being expressed by certain Big Brother Houseguests in its webcast by issuing a statement, but now on its main highlights program an advisory was shown on last nights episode.

Disclaimer: CBS Big Brother 15 placed a warning before the show for the first time in its history

'Big Brother' is a reality show about  group of people who have no privacy 24/7.

At times, the Houseguests reveal prejudices and other beliefs that CBS does not condone.

We certainly find the statements made by several of the Houseguests on the live Internet feed to be offensive.

Views or opinions expressed by a Houseguest either on any live feed from the House or during the broadcast, are those of the individuals speaking and do not represent the views or opinions of CBS or the producers of the program.

Viewer discretion is advised.'

Over the years, TV viewers have long become used to seeing content disclaimers for violence, profanity and nudity, but Big Brother had never had such a warning for racial prejudice.

The 15th season of Big Brother has shown more than one houseguest making racist comments to other contestants on the show.

Some have criticized the program for including such content, yet the show’s viewership has climbed in the wake of the controversy.

'Watchu gon do gurl?' Aaryn said in an attempt to rile an African American housemate

There was outrage over the racist 
comments uttered on Big Brother last week.

After Thursday's eviction episode, Aaryn Gries targeted fellow housemate Candice Stewart by flipping over her mattress.

After warning her not to flip her mattress again, Gries responded back in a 'black' accent mocking the African-American Stewart.

'Whatchu gon' do gurl...whatchu gon' do? Class girl. Where's yo class?' Aaryn mocked.

And not to be outdone by her friend, GinaMarie Zimmerman piped in with more racism.

As Candice was getting worked up, GinaMarie confronted her saying: 'You want the black to come out?'

Earlier in the month, the 'Big Brother' 
live feeds captured Season 15 contestants Aaryn Gries and GinaMarie 
Zimmerman making racist and homophobic comments about their competitors.

'Dude, shut up, go make some rice,' Aaryn said about Helen, an Asian-American contestant.

Later,
GinaMarie added, 'Andy was like, 'I'm gonna punch her in the face,' and
I was like, 'Maybe that'll make her eyes straight.''

Speaking
about Howard and Candice, two African-American contestants, the duo 
said: 'Blacks stick together ... They're like tokens ... They're like 
black Barbie and Kens.'

The duo also said Howard and Candice's 'blackness' was starting to come out.

Since
the comments were made, it has been revealed that Aaryn Gries has been 
dropped by her Austin, Texas-based modeling agency Zephyr Talent.

Shortly
after the incident, the live feeds captured 'Big Brother' producers 
making an announcement on the house PA system warning contestants not to
use racial slurs against other housemates.

Former
'Big Brother' contestant Ragan Fox has written an open letter to CBS 
calling on the network to air the racist statements on the show's CBS 
broadcast, to give viewers an accurate representation of their 
character.

'Houseguests 
GinaMarie, Aaryn, and Kaitlin referred to historically marginalized 
players as ‘tokens,’' Fox wrote. 'Sadly, they aren’t too far off in 
their assessment. Characters like Andy (Herren), Candice, Howard 
(Overby), and Helen are reduced to mere tokens when production fails to 
include micro-aggressions that they have to endure on a day-to-day 
basis.

What’s the point of 
casting racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities if production’s going to 
edit out the racism, ethnic discrimination, and homophobia that these 
people encounter inside the house?'

Race war: Candice had to be physically removed from the room by housemate Howard Overby

Housemate
Howard Overby - who is also black - had to physically remove Candice 
from the room to stop the fight from escalating. 

Both
GinaMarie and Aaryn drew criticism earlier this week when CBS aired 
some of their racist comments originally seen only by subscribers on the
internet-only live feed.

After
contestant Howard Overby told his fellow housemates’ of the ladies 
remarks, calling them comments that ‘you can’t apologize for,’ the 
network went to the videotape.

Awful: A contestant can be heard off-camera mocking an Asian housemate

Gries is shown mocking Asian house 
guest Helen, saying ‘shutup, go make some rice,’ while mocking nail 
salon workers.

Zimmerman then chimed in ‘Andy was like, 'I'm gonna 
punch her in the face,' and I was like, ''Maybe that'll make her eyes 
straight.’

Soon after, the dynamic duo moved on to deriding African-Americans.

Digging
the hole deeper, Zimmerman said fellow contestant Candice Stewart ‘is 
on the dark side, but she's already dark,’ with Gries adding ‘be careful
what you say in the dark because you might not be able to see the 
b----.’

Hateful: Another housemate can he heard joining in on the racism, the remarks were aired Sunday night by CBS

Fired: Aaryn Gries and GInamarie Zimmerman were fired after their employers became aware of their hateful comments on the show

Not to be outdone, Gries then called gay housemate Andy Herren a ‘queer.’

‘Dude, that’s rude!’ said a fellow contest seeing the slurs for the first time.

'Even
when these comments are made in fun, they still hurt and are 
disrespectful, especially when that person isn't there to hear it and 
back themselves up,’ the African-American Overby told the cameras. ‘It 
could privvy me to losing my temper, but that's a no-no. I have to keep 
my eyes down the field for the bigger prize.

Though not aired on Sunday night, Spencer Clawson was also heard slamming gays and praising Adolf Hitler.

'[Gries]
makes comments that are completely inappropriate, where she makes fun 
of other people for what they look like and their ethnicity, and I think
that's going to hurt her -- a lot -- in the game and outside the game,'
contestant Amanda Zuckerman opined.

Terrible: Spencer Clawson's praise of Hitler and homophobic slurs may have cost him his job with railroad operator Union Pacific

Fallout from the ranting was swift.

Gries, a 22-year-old student and sometimes model, was dropped from her talent agency.

'We
certainly find the statements made by Aaryn on the live Internet feed 
to be offensive,’ Zephyr Talent said in a statement on its Facebook 
page, adding that ‘upon much consideration, we have decided to release 
Aaryn from her contract…’

Zimmerman, a pageant director for East Coast USA Pageant, was also fired.

'We
are actually thankful that this show let us see GinaMarie for who she 
truly is,’ a spokesperson said, ‘we would never want her to be a role 
model to our future contestants.'

Currently on unpaid leave from Union Pacific while participating in the show, Clawson has also found himself in hot water.

‘The
values represented by Spencer Clawson's comments during the 'Big 
Brother' show do not at all align with Union Pacific's values,’ said a 
statement on the railroad operator's site. ‘Union Pacific does not 
condone his comments. Union Pacific is acting in accordance with 
Collective Bargaining Agreement terms regarding Mr. Clawson.'
