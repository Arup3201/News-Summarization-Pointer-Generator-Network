A teenage girl was left needing surgery after following an attack by 30 people, with one hitting her over the head with a skateboard.

Brooklyn Smith, 16, was at Venice Beach Skate Park in Los Angeles with her boyfriend on Thursday night when two of the suspects asked where they were from. 

One of the pair then said: 'That's her, that's her,' and the next thing she knew she was knocked to the ground and repeatedly punched and kicked, while bystanders did nothing.

A man is seen seconds after hitting Brooklyn Smith, 16, over the head with a skateboard during a confrontation in Venice Beach, Los Angeles 

The teenager is seen lying on the ground as a group of skateboarders surround her.  Bystanders watch as the brutal attack unfolds 

She was left with a four-inch gash in the back of her head which had to be closed together with staples.  

The man who clubbed her with the skateboard was seen dragging her across the road before he started hitting her.

She told KTLA they recognized her from a confrontation in February when she was told not to come back to the area.

Graphic footage of the violent incident was captured on a cellphone. It was then sent to the police. 

Brooklyn can be heard wailing in pain after the person filming says she just cracked.

The youngster said she blacked out after she was struck and then reached back to feel her head. When she saw her hands they were covered in blood 

She was taken to hospital with a four-inch gash and was left needing staples 

Her boyfriend has a tooth knocked out during the violent encounter 

'After that I blacked out a little bit,' she told the station. 

When she reached to feel her head, Brooklyn saw her hands were covered in blood, so started 'freaking out'. 

A woman then placed her body over Brooklyn's to shield her.

'If it wasn't for her, Lord knows what they would be doing to me,' Brooklyn said. 'They were hurting her too … because she was screaming.' 

Her boyfriend, meanwhile, had nine stitches to the back of his head, and upper and lower-lip. He also lost a tooth.
