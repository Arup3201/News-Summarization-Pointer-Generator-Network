The elderly mother and autistic son of a woman murdered at her Denver, Colorado home are being evicted from the property, just three days after her tragic death.

Federal housing officials are condemning the decision by the Denver Housing Authority to evict Sandra Roskilly's family, saying there is room for compassion in federal law.

Doris Kessler and 18-year-old Gregory Roskilly were locked out of their subsidized housing and Roskilly's belongings have been seized and handed to a public administrator.

Housing and Urban Development spokesman Jerry Brown said Tuesday his agency hopes Denver will reconsider after the horrific death.

Brown said federal lease agreements for subsidized housing with communities limit the ability of residents to turn over property to other people, but the rules aren't carved in stone.

'Our rules and guidelines are just that, and we would hope people would use compassion. They have discretion, which is why the city has a board to administer it. There was no notification on our end of an eviction, and we didn't have a say in it,' he said.

Brown said his agency is reviewing the case to see what steps can be taken to help the family, including finding them another place to live.

The Denver Housing Authority said it was forced to evict 70-year-old Kessler under federal law because Roskilly was the head of the household.

Police said 31-year-old Daniel Abeyta killed Roskilly and shot a second woman in her leg on Friday. Abeyta is hospitalized and facing a first-degree murder charge.

The Denver Housing Authority was apologetic about Monday's eviction and issued a statement to KMGH-TV saying they had no choice.

'Under federal policies and regulations, once the head of household is no longer with us, a live-in aide no longer has rights to that unit. We understand the family is under duress, but we will be locking the unit because they have no legal rights. We know this is a very tragic situation and offer our condolences,' the agency said.

The Denver Housing Authority owns and manages subsidized public housing under an agreement with the federal government. Denver agency spokeswoman Stella Madrid said the property was turned over on Monday to the public administrator, a private organization that determines disposition of assets when there is no will.

'We secured all property in the unit yesterday and we secured the unit,' Madrid said Tuesday. She refused further comment.

Kessler is now sleeping on a couch at the home of one of her children. Roskilly's autistic 18-year-old son is being kept in a facility in Pueblo but friends say he often visited his mother.

Roskilly's brother, Dennis Campbell, says his mother and nephew were given the boot by the city after 20 years. Kessler had moved in a decade ago.

'She's been living here 10 years and now they're telling her she's just a visitor and she has no rights whatsoever,' Campbell said.

Daniel Markin has been friends with 
Roskilly for 30 years. He said he still has a lot of questions, 
including how his friend wound up in a gunman's sights.

Markin said Abeyta was upset his neighbor's rose bushes were growing onto his property.

He allegedly murdered Roskilly and wounded his own wife after he fired a gunshot at one of
several propane tanks that he placed in the middle of a street last Friday.

Roskilly's brother, Campbell, spoke out for the first time about his sister's murder on Monday, saying that his sibling knew her neighbors had a tumultuous 
relationship and were no strangers to domestic violence.

According to Campbell, his sister would often console Abeyta's 26-year-old wife after fights, leading him to believe that when Roskilly heard gunshots and screams Friday, she rushed to her friend's aid. 

'In her last moments, she was doing what she wanted to do,' he told the station 9News. '[She was] 
trying to reach out to a neighbor that was in trouble.'

Good Samaritan: Roskilly's brother, Dennis Campbell, said he believes his sister died trying to protect her neighbor from her husband

Police said Abeyta was being held for 
investigation of charges including murder. The wounded woman was 
reported to be Abeyta's estranged spouse, according to KDVR.

Campbell
said on the day of the killing, he was on his way to his sister's 
house for a visit, but became struck in a traffic jam. He never got to see Roskilly 
alive again.

'In my mind, I just wish I had been there a little sooner. But, again, you never know,' Campbell said.

The
incident started at 10:40 a.m. Friday in the Harvey Park neighborhood 
in the 2200 block of South Irving, when police said Abeyta shot dead 
Roskilly after wounding his wife.

Officers who responded to the scene spotted a man, who then fired a shot at propane tanks set up in the middle of the street with gunpowder on top. The makeshift device 'activated,' but no one was injured.

One of the officers then shot Abeyta in the chest. Police said the man was in critical condition, while his wife was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the leg.

Before he was shot, Abeyta was seen walking with his weapons. Police alerted residents to stay inside and a high school was put on lockdown. Abeyta was shot within about a half hour of that warning.

Police didn't immediately say whether Abeyta lived in the neighborhood, but Melissa Allen told The Denver Post that he has lived in the area at least since she moved in three years ago.

She said he lived in a house with his wife and two children, who are in elementary school.

Allen said she and her children saw him walk down the street Friday.

Abeyta, an Army veteran allegedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, has had multiple run-ins with the law over the years. In 2007, he was arrested on charges of felony menacing with a deadly weapon and felony child abuse.

War of roses: A friend said that Abeyta was upset that Roskilly's rose bushes were encroaching on his property

Strong-willed: Roskilly recently celebrated a major millstone after losing 220lbs in a single year

Court documents cited by ABC2News state that Abeyta's wife took out a restraining order against him and the couple filed for divorce, but it was never finalized.

According to Roskilly's long-time friend, Markin, she and Abeyta had been in conflict in the past.

Markin explained to The Denver Channel that the 31-year-old man was upset that his neighbor's rose bushes were encroaching on his property.

'Daniel was pretty much trying to get Sandy out of her house anyway he could,' Markin said.

Loved ones described Roskilly as a loving and generous woman who would do anything for others. Earlier this month, the 47-year-old celebrated a major milestone in her life, according to 9News.

After struggling with obesity for years, Roskilly managed to shed 220lbs in just one year. On Facebook, Roskilly joyfully boasted about her weight loss.

On August 5, she wrote: 'I'm getting so close to my goal of 160 lb. that it scars [sic] me so time not jokin im now 199lb.'
