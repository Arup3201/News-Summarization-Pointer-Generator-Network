A teen caught joyriding in his parents' vehicle was forced into a very public shaming last week, when his mother forced him to stand in front of a busy North Miami intersection with a sign referring to himself as a 'follower.'

The teen, identified by the sign as a 15-year-old named Alejandro, was being punished after he and his cousin took his parents' Mercedes-Benz out of a spin last Wednesday, while his parents were not home.

When one of Alejandro's parents returned, they found the car in their driveway, with the fan belt still running and footprints on both the drivers and passengers side.

The sign reads 'Because I am a follower, I allow my cousin to influence me to take my step dad's car without his permission to joy ride. My name is Alejandro, and I am 15 yrs old!!!'

Alejandro soon fessed up, and was compelled by his mother to don the sign as punishment for following his cousin's lead.

The sign read 'Because I am a follower. I allow my cousin to influence me to take my 
stepdad's car without his permission to joyride. My name is Alejandro 
and I am 15 years old.'

People passing by stopped to talk to the teen while he stood.

'You can't be doing that now,' said one onlooker on camera by WVSN. 'You gotta act 
right now. Cars kill people. You get killed out here every day driving a
 car.'

'It takes a split second to kill somebody in a car, a split second, and 
you know who they coming after? Not the fool you lend the car to; they 
coming after your parents,' said another.

Alejandro's mother declined to be interviewed by WVSN, but said that she made Alejandro stand outside with the sign near their house in hopes of it being a punishment he learns from.

No one was hurt during the drive, although the car did sustain some water damage.

Alejandro's cousin did have a valid learner's permit when the two chose to take the car.

According to Alejandro's mother, the cost to fix any damage to the car will be coming out of Alejandro's pocket, to be paid by him doing chores around the house.
