The parents of a 10-year-old Muslim boy is suing the New York Metropolitan Transport Authority, after he was called a 'terrorist' this month by a bus driver in Brooklyn.

The boy says he was getting on a bus home from his school near Sheepshead Bay around 2:45pm when he couldn't find his metro card.

Like any vaguely religious person who's lost a debit car or set of keys, the boy asked for God's help in locating the important card.

He recited a run-of-the-mill Islamic prayer while he searched for, and eventually found, the card.

'The prayer is a common Muslim phrase used sometimes in the face of a challenge,' the boy's lawyer Hyder Naqvi told the New York Post. '[The child] said it as he was trying to find his card so he could get' home.

When he located the card and went to board the bus, the driver refused him entry. He heard his prayer and called him a 'terrorist' and then forced the boy back, closing the doors.

'He's a young boy, but he's old enough to know what discrimination is,' Naqvi said.

When the boy finally got home, he told his parents what happened and they decided to file a suit.

The family met with the MTA to identify the driver, but they were not informed his name.

'They decided at that point to seek counsel,' Naqvi said.

The family is suing the MTA and the driver for religious discrimination and civil-rights abuses for unspecified damages. Â
