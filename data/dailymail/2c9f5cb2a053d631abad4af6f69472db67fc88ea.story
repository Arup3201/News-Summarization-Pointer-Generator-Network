Officials are investigating how Vice-President Joe Biden took a free family vacation at a luxury government-owned log cabin despite a ban on federal employees using the property for anything other than official purposes.

Biden, his wife and 11 other family members spent four nights at the four-bedroom Brinkerhoff Lodge, situated next to a lake close to Mount Moran in the Grand Teton National Park, in August.

The idyllic property boasts a two-story living room, a full-length deck, Western-style chandeliers and walls lined with rustic log and pine paneling.

During his stay Biden is understood to have conducted no official business, held no meetings and kept no public schedule, suggesting his stay was purely recreational.

After Time magazine uncovered documents confirming his stay, the Vice President's office said he intended to reimburse the National Park, which owns and operates Brinkerhoff, to the tune of $1,200.

But further investigations by Time found the $1,200 figure appeared to assume the lodge was comparable to a single hotel room and would be far below market rate for similar properties, especially during peak season.

The magazine also revealed at least four Cabinet secretaries and other officials from President Barack Obama's administration have stayed at the lodge with friends and family in recent years.

They include former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, former Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Phil Schiliro and National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis.

LaHood, who spent eight nights at Brinkerhoff with his wife, his daughter-in-law, three grandchildren, two other adults and his son, in 2012, was said to have attended a Department of Transportation grant award event.

Duncan, who enjoyed six nights there with his wife and children in 2013, attended a nearby roundtable with Native American tribal leaders and an event at a local school.

Jarvis was said to have official business on just two of the five days he spent there in August 2012.

The others are yet to disclose whether any official bussiness was conducted during their visits.

Yesterday the Interior Department said it was launching an investigation into how the park service has managed the Brinkerhoff.

A spokesman told Time: 'In light of inconsistencies in billing practices and ambiguity in the policy at the park, the Interior Department has directed the National Park Service to conduct an immediate review of compliance with the policy and related recordkeeping and to seek reimbursement, where appropriate, for use of the Brinkerhoff.'

The cabin was built in 1947 by the family of oil magnate Zachary Brinkerhoff, before being acquired by the National Park Service in the 1950s.

It was subsequently  made available as VIP accommodation to presidents, members of Congress and government bureaucrats to use for vacations.

But following a public outcry a policy was adopted in 1992 banning its use for purely recreational activities.
