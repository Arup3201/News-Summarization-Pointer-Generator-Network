Love them or hate them, the selfie is the world's fastest spreading photo-sharing phenomenon.

And now a unique international passport card will allow applicants to submit a selfie taken on their smart phone rather than using the traditional photo booth pictures.

The cards, which will launch in Ireland from mid-July, were announced by Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charlie Flanagan, this week.

It will allow holders to fly throughout the 28-nation European Union as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, leaving their passport at home.

Applicants will be able to apply online or using a smart phone app, with a payment of €35 - around £26, and will be allowed to use a selfie on the card once it meets internationally accepted standards.

This is the first time a self-taken photograph will be accepted on any form of formal identification, and speaking at the launch, Mr Flanagan called the card 'pioneering' .

'Almost all passports worldwide are produced in the booklet format.This will be the first passport card that will be used for international travel,' he said. 

Applicants must already hold a regular passport and be 18-years-old to apply, and the card will be valid for five years, or however long its holder's normal passport is valid for.
