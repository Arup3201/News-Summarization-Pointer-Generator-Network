Hordes of teenagers hit Liverpool city centre last night to take part in the latest Carnage pub crawl.

The 'Playboys vs Bunnies' themed event attracted hundreds of revellers who enjoyed drinking cheap alcohol before spilling out into Liverpool's famous Concert Square.

The event, the third in this university year, includes alcoholic drinks for £1 and claims to offer students the 'best night of their lives'.

Young women braved the bitter cold wearing tiny shorts and ripped t-shirts while groups of young men dressed in bow ties joked around in the street.

One reveller appeared to suffer a wardrobe malfunction after laddering her fishnet tights while one boy dressed up as a 'sexy bunny' wearing a fur-edged black corset.

A number of young couples were getting close, while others appeared to enjoy the night out with their friends.

While the drinking appeared to have taken its toll on some party-goers, seen falling over on the cobbled streets, others called it a night and poured into take-away shops for food.

Carnage UK events, which are organised by Varsity Leisure Group, have come under fire in the past for promoting excessive drinking - with students offered cheap alcohol, and led from bar to bar.

But founder Paul Bahia, a Birmingham University graduate, has previously denied this, insisting the events are 'heavily focused on group identity, social and ethical cohesion and fancy dress themes'.
