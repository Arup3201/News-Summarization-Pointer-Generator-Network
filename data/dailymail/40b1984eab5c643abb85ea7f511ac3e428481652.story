A pair of hapless thieves spent five hours inside a restaurant after breaking in only to steal £2.50 and a handful of vegan sweets, CCTV has revealed.

The men are being hunted by Police Scotland after breaking into Artisan Lounge, a vegetarian restaurant and cafe, in Ayrshire on Monday night.

They spent five hours talking to themselves in mirrors and destroying stock before walking out with a few low-cost items.  

'You talking to me?': One of the thieves was filmed talking to himself in a mirror while brandishing a kitchen knife. The burglars spent five hours wandering around Artisan Lounge in Ayshire after breaking in

The men looked as though they could barely keep their balance as they walked around the restaurant. Their crime was captured on CCTV cameras installed by owners

Their 'peculiar' behaviour was captured on CCTV installed by staff at the restaurant which was closed for two days following the incident.  

'A lot of damage has been done, they went through a lot of our vegetables and some of what was sitting out. 

'The fridges were open so all of the food in there was gone as well,' said Euan Bryson, a manager at the restaurant. 

'The whole scenario is quite peculiar though, all they took out the building is £2.50 from a tip jar and a couple of these vegan sweets. 

'The building has thousands of pounds worth of artwork by local artists and our coffee machine is really expensive too. 

The men stole a handful of vegan sweets and a meagre £2.50 but left behind thousands of pounds worth of artwork and expensive kitchen equipment

At around midnight the men make their exit, stumbling back onto the street through the front door. Police Scotland said enquiries were ongoing

The restaurant was closed for two days after the theft, but owners say they are glad nothing more valuable was stolen 

'One of the staff had left their drone camera which is worth about £1,000 as well but they didn't take any of it.' 

Two expensive kitchen knives which the thieves are seen brandishing in the footage were however stolen. 

'There's quite a sinister element to it, at one point in the tape we saw one of them hiding behind the staircase clutching the knife as though he was ready to pounce. 

'The knife he had is made in the same way as a Samurai knife, it's very sharp and a viable weapon.

'I hope they are found soon, the local police are very good.' 

Police Scotland confirmed inquiries into the incident were ongoing.
