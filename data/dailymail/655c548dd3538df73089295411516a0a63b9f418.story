Plans: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles will announce that councils should ban speed bumps in town centres

Councils should ban speed bumps in town centres and provide more parking spaces for shoppers, Eric Pickles will announce today as he targets ‘anti-car’ measures.

The Communities Secretary will tell local authorities their parking rules must aim to rejuvenate high streets, rather than raising revenue from ‘penalising’ drivers.

New guidance will state that ‘draconian’ measures against cars, including ‘over-zealous’ traffic wardens, and ‘street clutter’ such as bollards and road humps which prevent parking, are stifling the local economy.

Half of parking services are run by councils and Mr Pickles said attempts to put off drivers have pushed shoppers away from high streets and into out-of-town shops.

He cited recent research from the Association of Town and City Management which has shown a strong relationship between parking provision and high street footfall.

Mr Pickles said simpler rules – to replace 7,000 pages of previous planning documents – would be issued to councils this week with guidance on the design of parking arrangements to boost walking and cycling but without penalising car users.

He said: ‘Draconian town hall parking policies and street clutter can make driving into town centres unnecessarily stressful and actually create more congestion because of lack of places to park.

‘Anti-car measures are driving motorists into the arms of internet retailers and out-of-town superstores.

‘Trying to find somewhere to park is an obstacle course in too many of our towns, cities and seaside resorts.

'Confusing and difficult car parking practices are undermining the economic vitality of the high street and tourist destinations.

‘Over-zealous parking wardens have inflicted real damage on local economies and given many towns and councils a bad name. Town halls need to ditch their anti-car dogma.’

Figures out this month from the RAC showed the 359 English councils raked in a £565million surplus from parking charges in 2011-12 – £50million more than the previous year.

This is what they earned from on-street parking, off-street parking and penalties, minus running costs.

Westminster council in London had the highest individual parking surplus at nearly £42million.

A Local Government Association spokesman said parking charges were falling in real terms, while councils were investing the money in filling potholes and improving roads.

He added: ‘Councils work hard to try to boost trade and keep high streets vibrant through parking incentives.

‘Creating more spaces in town and city centres where there is no room for them is simply not the way to draw more shoppers to the high street.’
