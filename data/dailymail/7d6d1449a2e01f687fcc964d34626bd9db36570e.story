Miniature horses are bringing smiles and therapy to ill children at Chicago’s Rush University Medical Center.

The hospital is using two of the adorable animals as part of a programme designed to bring comfort and distraction to paediatric patients.

Volunteers and hospital staff escort the unusual visitors, which are about the size of a large dog, straight into the young patients’ rooms, where they can momentarily forget their surroundings.

The visits are the brainchild of ex-nurse Jodie Diegel, who runs the Mane in Heaven therapy programme

On a recent visit, epilepsy patient, Emily Pietsch, found great joy nuzzling Lunar, one of the horses.

The 17-year-old said: ‘They're so nice, and they don't judge, and they're so sweet.’

The programme is the brainchild of Jodie Diegel, a former nurse who owns the horses and runs an animal therapy programme named Mane in Heaven.

She said: ‘We have been in nursing homes and homes for the disabled. So, we've been indoor in facilities, but this is our very first hospital visit. We are so excited.’

The visit went so well that future trips with Lunar and Mystery are planned.

Most programmes introduce patients to cuddly dogs, but the effect with horses can be the same

Some research and anecdotal reports suggest animals help lower pain, blood pressure, fear and stress in young hospital patients.

Most programmes introduce patients to cuddly dogs, but the effect with horses can be the same.

Robyn Hart, director of Child Life Services at Rush University Medical Center, said: ‘There's a lot of evidence that shows that animals have a relaxing effect on people - adults and children alike - and that creates positive affect, and we know now that there's a strong connection between the mind and the body.

‘So when the mind is feeling good, when there's positive feelings, that helps towards recovery and healing.’
