A pilot was injured after he was forced to make a dramatic emergency landing in a private plane.

The twin-engine aircraft encountered problems, believed to be with one of the engines, as it flew near Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire.

The pilot, who is said to be in his 40s, had to bring the single-seater aircraft down in a field not far from the coastal village.

Scene: The single-engine plane was brought down in a field just outside Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, after the pilot was forced into making an emergency landing

Emergency Services: Fire crews and police officers stand outside as the pilot, believed to be in his 40s, was treated

Paramedics assessed the unidentified pilot in the cockpit and he was eventually taken to hospital on a stretcher while wearing a neck brace.

Witnesses said one of the propellers did not appear to be working as the plane descended towards the field and it is not known where the pilot was flying to. 

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'One male pilot was on board and he is okay. It was an emergency landing. We are assisting at the moment.

He was initially taken onto a Scottish Ambulance Service National Risk and Resiliance Department vehicle then transferred to an ambulance on a stretcher further up the field.

Extinguished: The aircraft was covered in a chemical foam as firefighters battle to put out the blaze

Malfunction: Witnesses who saw the plane come down claimed one of the propellers did not seem to be working as it headed towards the field

Aftermath: Firefighters continue to make sure the plane is safe as they surround the foam-covered plane

He was casually dressed in blue jeans and a black fleece when he was taken off the aircraft.

One onlooker said: 'He remained calm and appeared to be very still when he was put in the stretcher. It must have been quite an ordeal.'

A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'We got the call at 15:45pm.

'There were five appliances there, two from Stonehaven and three from Aberdeen plus an urban search and rescue unit. There was just short of 40 personnel there. We used two jets and foam as a precaution.'

Clean-up: The pilot was taken to hospital on a stretcher and wearing a neck brace when he was taken to hospital by paramedics

Response: Eight fire engines attended the scene with 40 personnel on hand to deal with the emergency
