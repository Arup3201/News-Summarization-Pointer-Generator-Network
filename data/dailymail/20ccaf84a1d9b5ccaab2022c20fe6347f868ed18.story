A juror was dismissed on Tuesday in the murder trial of ex-New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez after the woman admitted to lying about being a big fan of the team. 

Judge Susan Garsh said today that the juror had been to more Pats games than she wrote on her jury questionnaire and had previously expressed an interest in serving on the jury.

Hernandez, a former Patriots tight-end, is accused of the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who was dating his fiancée's sister.  

'There is credible evidence that the juror did talk about the case over the last few years, and that the juror expressed a specific opinion about the case,' said the judge at Massachusetts Superior Court in Fall River.

After a closed hearing on the matter, the judge said the female juror had held opinions about the murder trial and said it would be difficult for prosecutors to convict Hernandez without a murder weapon. 

'Over the last few years, the juror has expressed an interest in serving on this particular jury', Garsh said. 

'There is credible evidence that the juror has attended more Patriots games than were disclosed on the questionnaire.' 

The juror also reportedly discussed evidence that has been ruled out of the trial.

The judge had earlier closed the courtroom to the public and the media  to deal with a juror issue.

Prosecutors requested the closure, and the defense did not object.

The judge spent about 20 minutes earlier on Tuesday questioning a juror in open court but outside the hearing of the public.  

Prosecutors, the defense team and Hernandez huddled around her as the judge murmured questions. 

As Garsh closed the court, she said questioning in that manner was difficult and this was the only reasonable alternative.

'The closure is no broader than necessary to protect the interest of the state,' she said.

The trial will now continue with five alternate jurors. Tuesday was the first day back at the trial since the Patriots won the Super Bowl.

Proceedings began last week but were suspended Monday when a snowstorm hit.

Hernandez, 25, had a $40 million contract with the Patriots when he was arrested.

The Tuesday morning session began with a lengthy private sidebar conversation among the judge, prosecutors and the defense. After about 20 minutes, the juror was called in.

In a separate murder case that has yet to go to trial, Hernandez was charged last year in Boston with killing two men in 2012 after someone spilled a drink on him at a nightclub. 

The judge has ruled that prosecutors in the Lloyd case cannot tell the jury about those slayings.

Hernandez faces life imprisonment if convicted of killing Lloyd.

Shaneah Jenkins, who was dating Odin Lloyd at the time of his murder, had taken the stand for the defense on Friday during Hernandez's murder trial. She was due to resume testimony on Tuesday before the juror issue arose
