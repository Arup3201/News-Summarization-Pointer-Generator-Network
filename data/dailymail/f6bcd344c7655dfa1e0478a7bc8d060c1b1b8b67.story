A mother and her ex-boyfriend have been charged with murdering her son, five years after he died from injuries he suffered when they allegedly violently shook him as a newborn.

Brayden Grusman-Buckmaster died last year from injuries sustained when he was two months old and living with his mother, Monique Bork, and her then boyfriend, Edward M. Thompson, Jr.

He was taken to Sunrise Trauma Center in Las Vegas, Nevada in August 2006 and doctors found he had injuries consistent with Shaken Baby Syndrome - and did not think he would survive.

Bork, now 26, told police after her son was hospitalised that he had not been acting himself. She said that he had been hit in the head by a falling toy a few weeks prior.

But Thompson, now 32, told police that Bork was not telling the truth and that he had dropped a telephone on the boy's face, theÂ Las Vegas Sun reported.

Brayden was taken off life-support a week later and placed in hospice care. He lived with his grandparents for two years and was eventually 
put into foster care and adopted.

He suffered numerous problems as a 
result of the alleged abuse. He was blind, had cerebral palsy and relied on a gastronomy tube to feed him.

Victim: Brayden died in July 2011 from his injuries. After the alleged abuse, he was placed in foster care and later adopted. Right, he is pictured with his adoptive mother Gayle Grusman

Injuries: The youngster was left with cerebral palsy and was brain damaged. He was also legally blind

When Brayden died last July, news channels ran segments about his story and a witness stepped forward to say she had taken the boy to the hospital with Bork when he was a baby.

She told police that Bork and Thompson had married and bragged how 'now we can't testify against each other'.

But when their relationship began to crumble, Bork told the woman that Thompson had shaken the baby, causing his injuries. 'I know he did it,' she had said. 'I know he did it from day one.'

The former couple has now been charged 
with murder and child abuse and neglect with substantial bodily harm in 
the death of the boy.

'Abuse': A friend of Bork's saw news coverage of the boy's death on TV last year and stepped forward to tell police Bork had told her Thompson had shaken the baby

Struggles: Brayden relied on a gastronomy tube to feed him until his death

Remembered: Grusman and her partner Tish Buckmaster have marked one year since his death

Thompson was arrested on Monday and Bork was arrested on Tuesday. Both are being held in the Clark County Detention Center without bail.

It comes after outcry following Brayden's death that no charges had been brought against his abusers.

Investigators had originally said they were unable to pinpoint who had carried out the alleged abuse as there had been four people in the house: Bork, Thompson and Thompson's mother and brother.

'The DA won't re-open the case because 
there's no new evidence as to which adult it was in the household,' one 
of the boy's adopted mothers, Gayle Grusman had told KLAS-TV.

'Somebody needs to pay for it, somebody killed him,' his other mother, Tish Buckmaster, said.

Despite his extensive injuries, the women remembered their son as perfect. 'He was just a very happy child,' Buckmaster said. 'When he declined do fast it was a shock to us.'

Grusman added: 'I loved his half-crooked Elvis smile. He was our world.'
