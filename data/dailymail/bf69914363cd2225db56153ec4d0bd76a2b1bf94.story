DNA recovered from crime scene where a mother-of-three was murdered in the south of France matches that of a British suspect, a prosecutor said today.

It came as 32-year-old Robert Plant prepared to be formally placed under investigation by judges – the first step towards a criminal trial under the French legal system.

Plant is suspected of sexually assaulting and then killing Joudia Zimmat, 34, while she was out jogging in Nimes.

DNA trace: The French Police issued this photofit picture of British suspect Robert Plant from Chatham, Kent

Home: Plant, originally from Chatham, Kent, has been living with his mother Esther in a luxurious villa in the same road as the one where Ms Zimmat¿s body was found

Stephane Bertrand, the tourist town’s 
prosecutor, said: ‘We compared the genetic profile with the evidence 
found at the scene, and the results were a match. His DNA corresponds 
with the objects recovered from the crime scene.’

Ms Zimmat failed to collect her 
three-year-old daughter from school last Thursday, and then a police 
sniffer dog found her body in scrubland.

She had been repeatedly hit around the face, and was stabbed so savagely that she was barely recognisable.

A Stanley knife and two stones coated 
in blood found close to where Ms Zimmat’s body was discovered are 
believed to have been used by the murderer.

Arrest: Robert Plant, 32, is being questioned about the murder of Joudia Zimmat, 34, who was attacked while out jogging in a suburb of Nimes, in Provence

Odd-job: French police said they had arrested Plant, an odd-job man who moved to France aged ten and who lives with his mother in a luxury villa 300 yards from where the body was found

Trace: DNA matching Plant was recovered
from the scene close to where Ms Zimmat's body was found in brambles

Brutal murder: The alarm was raised when jogger Joudia Zimmat, whose body was found lying next to a path in Courbessac, failed to arrive to pick her children up from school on Thursday

Plant is originally from Chatham, 
Kent, but now lives with his mother, Esther, in a luxurious villa in the
same road as the one where Ms Zimmat’s body was found.

A tearful Mrs Plant was back in Nimes today after returning from a visit to Paris to see her daughter, Victoria.

Mrs Plant was accused by police of 
providing a false alibi to her son – saying that he was at home all day 
on Thursday – but was not expected to be charged.

Instead she is expected to provide 
support to Plant when he appears before prosecutors. He will be ‘mis en 
examen’, the French legal term for ‘put under examination’ – the process
which launches a formal enquiry by examining judges before a trial.

Plant denies having anything to do 
with the murder. On Tuesday he was accompanied by detectives as they 
searched his mother’s house, which has a swimming pool.

Police also believe his face matches a photo-fit image created by witnesses who saw a man hiding in bushes before the attack.

Plant’s father died of cancer last 
summer, and he had been staying with his mother for a number of months, 
while looking for work as a decorator and art restorer.

One neighbour described him as a ‘tall, clean-cut, pleasant young man who was often strolling around with his pet dog.’

Ms Zimmat regularly went running on 
jogging paths in the suburb of Courbessac, which is a few miles from the
centre of Nimes, which is famous for its Roman remains including an 
amphitheatre.

Plant had hand injuries ‘consistent 
with bramble scratches’ and the victim’s body was found ‘in a thicket of
brambles’, said a police. The source said the police were investigating
whether there was any CCTV footage that would help their inquiry.

Neighbours also described Ms Zimmat 
as a ‘pretty and petite woman’, who had recently moved to a house in the
area with her family.

A friend described how Plant had gone
to ‘drink pints of beer’ at La Tosca, a local Italian bar and 
restaurant, the day after the killing.

Quiet suburb: The British suspect is thought to have living in Nimes with his parents for several months

Sources: One police officer in France said the victim had been so savagely attacked her face was unrecognisable

Khadra, a waitress at La Tosca, told Le Figaro: ‘He came in on Friday. He regularly came here to drink pints. It’s been years since we first met.  He comes several times a week.

‘He speaks French very well but with a strong accent. On Friday he had injuries on his forehead and his hands. We asked him what had happened, and he said: ‘It’s the thorns that scratched me when I went to get the dog who had fallen into a hole.

Another acquaintance, a former Foreign legionnaire called Andy from Scotland, said: ‘He was a loner. He was very well educated. We’re not from the same type of background but he often came her for a drink. He’s very pleasant.’

Nimes is in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France, and is hugely popular with British expatriates and tourists.
