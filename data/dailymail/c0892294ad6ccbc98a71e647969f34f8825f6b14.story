The hedge-fund playboy who hosted the fundraising dinner where Mitt Romney was secretly filmed making his '47 per cent' comments has fathered a love child with a New York woman, it was alleged today.

Marc Leder, co-CEO of Sun Capital Partners, is said to have a ten-year-old daughter to a blonde woman in her forties who lives in Manhattan's exclusive Upper West Side, allegedly paid for by the 50-year-old.

It was revealed in September that the divorced millionaire went 'off the rails' after he discovered his wife of 22 years had an affair with her 22-year-old tennis coach and started to throw debauched parties in the Hamptons.

Plan: Marc Leder hosted the $50,000-a-plate fundraiser where Mr Romney made his much-criticised remarks in May. He has reportedly helped organise another fundraiser for the Republican campaign this Saturday

A source told the New York Post about his love child: 'Marc and the lady, a single working woman, have had a longtime on/off 
affair and she became pregnant.

'There was a wrangle over money, but they
have reached a generous and amicable agreement for child support 
through lawyers.

'Marc has also put the mother and his child up in an 
apartment on West 57th Street.'

During the 2012 presidential campaign, Leder was a huge Romney backer and defender of his role at Bain Capital.

The May fundraiser where Romney was recorded saying that 
47 per cent of voters planning to back President Obama believed they 
were 'entitled' to government support and considered themselves 
'victims', was held at his $3million Florida home.

Comments: Mr Romney (seen here during the town hall debate with President Obama at Hofstra University in New York, on Tuesday) has since retracted the remarks

Leaked: Mother Jones, a liberal news magazine, says it obtained the footage from an anonymous person who attended the fundraiser

Bona fide: The Romney campaign did not dispute the authenticity of the video

Leder - who is worth an estimated 
$400million - already has three children to his wife Lisa and they are said 
to know about their half sister.

He told the Post in a statement: 'I became the proud parent of a beautiful little girl last January with 
my former girlfriend of a year. We maintain a close relationship, and 
are committed to raising our daughter jointly.'

This summer, the hedge fund manager 
became known as the 'Hamptons' Hugh Hefner' due to the wild parties he 
threw at a rented $500,000-a-month mansion.

He bragged to his well-heeled guests that he would have a 'pool full of girls' at the parties

After the 47 per cent comments were made public, Leder had been telling potential donors that he 
wanted to 'make the situation right' by raising more funds for the Romney
campaign before the election.

Facts: Romney has statistics on his side when it comes to the 47 percent comment -- only 53 percent of Americans pay federal income tax after deductions and rebates
