A principal has turned herself in after she and two female staffers were accused of assaulting a former staff member of the high school.

Thelma Jarrett, the principal of Coolidge High School near Washington, D.C., allegedly ordered the assault on former school worker Rashia King-Hicks, and took part in the attack, police said.

The two other women involved in the alleged attack – Donna Pixley and Bridgette V. Stevens – kicked and hit her outside of the school’s football stadium after the homecoming football game.

Hot water: Thelma Jarrett, the principal of a Washington D.C. high school, and two staff members have been accused of beating up a former co-worker after a homecoming football game

Court ruling: Jarrett was arraigned yesterday in D.C. Superior Court

Ms King-Hicks was watching the school’s homecoming game from the parking lot, according to the police report. She later told officers that police ‘came out of nowhere,’ punching her in the face.

The police document goes onto say that the three women – including Jarrett – allegedly punched and kicked the defenseless woman until a mother of one of the school’s students saw the attack and used her body to shield King-Hicks.

However, parent-teacher coordinator Terry Goings said that the account was all-wrong and that Jarrett was attempting to break up the fight.

The Washington Examiner reported that the three women were put on administrative leave following the November 2 incident.

Long career: Jarrett has worked for the public school system for 19 years

The alleged assault comes as a shock, as Jarrett has been a cornerstone within the D.C. public school system.

She was promoted three years ago to help change Coolidge High School, which has experienced its fair share of troubles.

Jarrett has worked for the public school system for 19 years, and later turned herself in. She was arraigned yesterday in D.C. Superior Court, according to WUSA.

King-Hicks, who was the former after-school coordinator for Coolidge, was not seriously injured in the attack, but said she is not commenting on the case, save for that she is baffled as to why they did it.
