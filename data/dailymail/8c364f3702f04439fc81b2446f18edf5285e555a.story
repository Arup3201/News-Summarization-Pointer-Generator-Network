Hang on a Mo: Olympic hero Farah will receive £250,000 to run just half of this year's London Marathon and a further £500,000 to race the full distance in 2014

Mo Farah has been accused of 
undermining the spirit of the London Marathon after signing a lucrative 
deal to run just half the race.

The double Olympic gold medallist is 
being paid £250,000 by sponsor Virgin to run half the course at this 
year’s 26-mile race and a further £500,000 for the full race in 2014.

Farah says running half the race will help him ‘understand the course’ in preparation for the following year.

Fellow athletes expressed bemusement 
at the ‘race within a race’ arrangement and the extent to which 
organisers are prepared to go to accommodate the 29-year-old runner’s 
wishes.

Paula Radcliffe, who has won the women’s race in London three times, questioned Farah’s decision yesterday.

She said: ‘Honestly I find it a little bit strange – it’s not what I would have done.

‘Either you find a good half marathon somewhere or you take the plunge and attack the distance and race it.

‘Here he’s caught between two stools. 
For me, you go into the London Marathon when you’re ready to do it and 
attack it  hard. But everybody has different reasons.’

Former Olympic triple-jumping champion
Jonathan Edwards called it ‘odd’, while Steve Cram, one of the world’s 
top middle-distance runners in the Eighties, said the plan was 
‘difficult to comprehend’.

A Virgin London Marathon spokeswoman 
denied Farah’s decision was at odds with the race’s ethos, saying he 
wasn’t competing but simply taking part.

Farah has long been seen as the man to revive British interest in the men’s race, which has long been dominated by Kenyans.

The last British man to win in the capital was Eamonn Martin 20 years ago.

Farah said: ‘As a young boy growing up in London it has always been my ambition to run the London Marathon.

‘I won the Mini Marathon when I was younger and have watched the race every year for as long as I can remember.

‘I will make my marathon debut in the
2014 London Marathon but will run the 2013 race to half way as part of 
my preparation for 2014.

‘It will allow me to understand the course and the systems that I will need when I run the full distance.’

Hugh Brasher, the London Marathon race
director, said:  ‘We have been following and supporting Mo’s career 
since he first won the Mini London Marathon 15 years ago and are full of
anticipation for his marathon debut.

Short circuit: Farah will not complete this year's race, which will pass the Cutty Sark in Greenwich, although he will run all of next year's 26-mile route

‘Hopefully, his experience of the 
race, the route and the unique atmosphere of the London Marathon will 
stand him in good stead when he takes on the full race next year.

‘We are sure he will gain some valuable insights and come back fully prepared for the challenge.’

Farah, who won Olympic gold over 
10,000 and 5,000 metres in London last year, has always said he would 
eventually move up to the full marathon.

His coach, Alberto Salazar, has suggested he might aim for a marathon and 10,000m double at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

Yesterday, Farah made a victorious 
start to his 2013 season by winning the 3,000m indoors at the British 
Grand Prix in Birmingham. He will run a half-marathon in New Orleans 
next weekend.
