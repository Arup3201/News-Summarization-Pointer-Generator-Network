A skin-care specialist to the Hollywood stars has been acquitted of charges she plotted to murder a rival beautician she wrongly blamed for stalking her.

Dawn Melody DaLuise, 56, was cleared in Los Angeles County Superior Court after about an hour of deliberations by jurors in the bizarre case that included allegations that a former NFL lineman was hired to knock off the competitor.  

Prosecutors alleged DaLuise, who has counted Jennifer Aniston, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Christian Slater among clients at her Santa Monica salon, became so obsessed with a competitor that she tried hiring a hit man to kill him.

DaLuise was released immediately after the not guilty verdict on charges of solicitation of murder and solicitation of assault.

'Obviously, we're ecstatic about getting not guilty on both counts,' defense lawyer Jamon Hicks said. 

'We're just hoping to help her rebuild her reputation, rebuild her business and rebuild her life.' 

Defense lawyers said DaLuise was venting when she told friends she hated esthetician Gabriel Suarez and had found someone to take him out.

She was reportedly furious when Suarez moved into the same building as her salon, Skin Refinery, in Santa Monica. 

Authorities said there was no evidence anyone acted on a plot to kill Suarez.

DaLuise wrongly believed Suarez was behind a campaign that included posting lewd flyers of her face photo-edited on pornography, emails and Craigslist ads with her home address seeking men to act out a 'rape fantasy'. 

In a bizarre twist, police later connected the postings to a friend of DaLuise.

Authorities arrested her friend, Edward Feinstein, on suspicion of stalking and said he had goaded her into the murder-for-hire plot. Feinstein has not been charged in the case. 

Ricardo Santiago, a spokesman for the district attorney, said that investigation continues. 

Prosecutors said DaLuise became obsessed with Suarez, who had recently opened his business on the same West Hollywood block as her Skin Refinery, which counted Alicia Silverstone, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Christina Ricci among its clientele. 

At some point, DaLuise confided in Chris Geile, who played three games for the Detroit Lions in 1987, about her suspicions that Suarez was behind the stalking. 

Geile testified that he was only a shoulder to cry on for DaLuise and was never asked to kill anyone. 

She sent text messages to friends saying Geile was going to 'take Gabriel out'. 

DaLuise reportedly moved to California to become a model in the 1980s. She lost her business after being jailed in March on charges of solicitation of murder and solicitation of assault likely to produce great bodily injury, Hicks said. 

Her personal website is also now defunct. Getting back to work will be her second priority after reuniting with her two daughters once she's released from custody. 

Hicks said DaLuise grabbed his leg as the first verdict was read. Fearing the jury would convict her on the second, lesser count, he cautioned her to wait before celebrating.

'When you heard the second 'not guilty,' you could hear her gasp and say, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you,' he said.
