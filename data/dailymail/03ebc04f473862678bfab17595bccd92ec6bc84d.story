Forget points on the board, it’s about followers on the web these days.

At least, that is, according to Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.

The Old Trafford chief made the bizarre attempt to satisfy investors this week by highlighting the impact signing for the club has had on the social-media popularity of players such as Daley Blind, Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao.

Manchester United's Daley Blind has had a 73 per cent increase in Twitter followers since joining the club

In the case of Blind, Woodward pointed to his 73 per cent increase in Twitter followers, a figure which equates to 173,000.

However, if Blind’s motivation for joining United was simply to maximise ‘retweets’ and ‘favourites’, perhaps he should have signed for Chelsea, Liverpool or Arsenal.

For Sportsmail can reveal the big winners of this summer’s Twitter Transfer Tussle.

We have obtained numbers from Twitter which disclose the growth in following for close-season signings from each Premier League club.

Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas has attracted 900,000 followers since his £30million switch from Barcelona

Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli has added 462,000 followers since his £16million switch

And we can reveal that it is Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas who has attracted the most new followers since his £30million move from Barcelona. The Spaniard’s numbers are up by 900,000, taking his total to 7.42m.

Mario Balotelli, meanwhile, has added 462,000 in the wake of his arrival at Liverpool.

Woodward, however, may well point to percentage increase as a true barometer of social-media success and Blind – at 73 per cent – still outdoes Fabregas (14 per cent) and Balotelli (16 per cent).

But none of those three can compete with the 203 per cent rise enjoyed by Calum Chambers following his move from Southampton to Arsenal.

Newcastle Ayoze Perez has 28,000 followers on Twitter - a 197 per cent rise since joining the Magpies

Manchester United midfielder posted this picture to his twitter account on Thursday afternoon 

The 19-year-old is up from 84,000 to 255,000 in just four months – now those figures really would have Woodward purring.

But Chambers isn’t alone in recording a three-figure percentage jump.

Newcastle’s Ayoze Perez is up 197 per cent to 28,000. The 21-year-old - a previous unknown in the Spanish second tier - has scored three times in his last three matches to announce his arrival on the Premier League stage following a £1.6m move from Tenerife.

Hull defender Andrew Robertson notched for Scotland against England on Tuesday night and he is another enjoying new-found notoriety, the former Dundee United youngster seeing his following rocket 123 per cent to just over 12,000.

Eric Dier, at Spurs, is up 150 per cent to 44,000, while West Brom’s Brown Ideye has nearly trebled his following.

Other summer signings have not been quite as lucky, Crystal Palace’s James McArthur has only attracted 2,900, while Leicester’s Marc Albrighton has added just 1,500.

But does any of the above really matter in comparison to Premier League points?

Only at Old Trafford, it seems…
