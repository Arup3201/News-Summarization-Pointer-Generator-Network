Just hours after twelve people were killed in a Paris massacre, an Australian fundamentalist preacher declared that insults to the Prophet Mohammed are 'not allowed' and a 'very likely to simulate some kind of response.'

Controversial self-styled sheik Mohammed Junaid Thorne, from Perth, wrote on social media that staff at satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo had 'forbade to learn the lesson' of a firebombing in 2011. The bombing occurred a day after a caricature of the Prophet was published.

'Insulting someone's Prophet is very likely to stimulate some kind of response. It is not allowed under any context/religion,' Thorne, in his mid 20s, tweeted this morning. 

'If you want to enjoy 'freedom of speech' with no limits, expect others to exercise 'freedom of action'.'

Mohammed Junaid Thorne said insulting someone's Prophet 'is not allowed under any context/religion' and argued 

Thorne refused to answer questions about his statement when contacted by Daily Mail Australia on Thursday, asking 'not to be quoted or mentioned in any article'. 

But just hours later, he expanded on his remarks in a 563 word letter on his Facebook page, writing: 'When you provoke an enormous number of people, or degrade the followers of a religion by insulting something or someone they hold sacred, don't expect to be left alone.

'This goes for everyone: Muslims and others. The cartoonists in #CharlieHebdo had made it a habit of insulting our Prophet -peace be upon him-. 

'They were warned and even threatened more than once. On one occasion, their premises was fire-bombed, yet they forbade to learn a lesson. 

'I'm not condoning what happened, but I'm just stating that there must be a line/limit for freedom of speech, and when people or religions are being affected, the boundaries shouldn't be crossed. 

He said he was praying for all violence to come to an end and added: 'There is now a hashtag on twitter (calling to kill Muslims) and no one is being arrested or charged for that, neither is it gaining any media attention.'

Thorne's remarks came as pictures emerged of the preacher last year accompanying Sulayman Khalid, 20, to a court appearance.

Khalid, from western Sydney, was charged with terrorism related offences last month over an alleged plot to commit guerilla warfare in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney.

The court appearance concerned allegations Khalid intimidated an Iraqi cleaner at a western Sydney shopping centre. 

Khalid rose to infamy after wearing an Islamic State symbol onto the set of an SBS television program about the Islamic State last year. 

Thorne would not answer questions about how he knew Khalid, only joking: 'We used to go out in (Kings) Cross together... Since we started going to church'. 

Over the past twelve months, Thorne's views have been the subject of public scrutiny. 

Preaching: Junaid Thorne does not describe himself as an Islamic State supporter. He told the ABC last year: 'I may support them [on] certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.'

Following the nation's biggest ever terror raids last September, he labelled Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in a statement posted on his Facebook page. 

After Melbourne man Numan Haider, 18, allegedly stabbed two police officers outside of a police station, Thorne said that he had been 'murdered by authorities'. 

Thorne later told the ABC Haider had attended some of his lectures, which he performs around the country.

Thorne does not describe himself as a supporter of the Islamic State. 

He told the ABC last year: 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them [Islamic State], I would get in trouble,' he said.

'If I was to say that [I] don't support them at all, that would be untrue.

'I may support them on certain issues, while I disagree with them on other issues'.
