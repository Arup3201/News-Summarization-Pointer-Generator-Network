Innocent: Teresa Hughes, 39, launched a hate campaign against primary school headteacher Phil Jackson (pictured) by spreading false rumours he had abused her daughter

An angry mother launched a hate campaign against a primary school headteacher by spreading false rumours that he had sexually abused her daughter, a court heard.

Teresa Hughes, 39, sent a hand-written letter to teacher Phil Jackson before bombarding Lyppard Grange Primary School in Worcester with phone calls.

Hughes then met another parent outside Tesco and pretended Mr Jackson had been suspended for touching her nine-year-old daughter Gabriella.

She also left a rambling message on the school's answerphone, claiming staff were trying to get Gabriella to leave.

Hughes, who lives in Worcester, admitted one charge of harassment when she appeared before magistrates in the town on Monday.

Prosecutor Leslie Ashton told the court the 'malicious unfounded allegations' caused Mr Jackson so much stress that he likened it to being diagnosed with cancer.

The court heard how Hughes started a smear campaign following an altercation in the school playground on June 11 last year.

Ms
 Ashton said: 'Mr Jackson was in the school playground welcoming 
students into the school when Gabriella approached him saying she wanted
 to speak to him and he said he would find her later and she went off.

'Then Teresa came up to him two minutes later, raised both her arms in the air, and then walked away.'

On the same day a letter arrived for the headteacher, who had been at the school since 2009, which said that Hughes had felt used.

The court was told that Mr Jackson had found the letter confusing and showed it to his deputy head, who told the governors about it and contacted the local authority.

Staff and governors sent a reply to Hughes after a meeting at the school two days later.

On
 June 14 Hughes left a number of messages on the school’s answerphone.

Some said her daughter would not be returning to the school, while others accused staff of trying to force her daughter to leave.

In her final message, she said she had spoken to her daughter and that Gabriella did not want to leave adding that the school would not be allowed to 'get away with it'.

When Hughes saw another parent, whose daughter is in the same class as Gabriella, outside a branch of Tesco, she told him false rumours about Mr Jackson.

Ms Ashton told the court: 'She said "don’t tell anyone but Mr Jackson has been suspended".

'And when he (the parent) asked why, she whispered ‘for touching Gabby’.

'These were malicious unfounded allegations against the teacher that have had an effect on him.

'The allegations have caused him such a huge amount of stress that he likened it to when he was diagnosed with cancer.'

Mark Lister, mitigating, told the court that it was an unusual case, and that Hughes was of good character.

Chairman of the bench Judy Hulland adjourned the case for the mum to be sentenced on March 31.

Lyppard Grange Primary School is located at the heart of Warndon Villages in Worcester and has 307 pupils aged 4-11.

The school received a ‘satisfactory’ rating in all areas by Ofsted inspectors in July 2012.

A staff member at the school today told MailOnline that Mr Jackson did not wish to speak about the case. 'I think it's all been said,' she added.
