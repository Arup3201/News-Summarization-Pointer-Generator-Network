With the sports luxe trend showing no sign of abating, designers have found a way of reinventing the style for another season.

The likes of Jeremy Scott and Adidas are hot-footing a new trend for sporty fashion in the form of a high heeled trainer.

The bizarre footwear is even being championed by renowned style icon Anna Dello Russo - so are we all going to be wearing the kooky style next season?

Hot new trend? Anna Dello Russo, known for being fashion-forward, gives Jeremy Scott and Adidas' heeled trainers their first outing at Paris Fashion Week

Trainers have been the 
footwear staple this season, just one look down at the feet of 
front-row goers and New Balances are everywhere.

But the trend for functional footwear has been given a more feminine makeover with the help of a few inches.

Would YOU wear them? Clearly giving the sports luxe trend an update, fashionistas in Paris are hoping the stiletto trainer will catch on

Celebrity stylist Alex Longmore helped shed some light on the trend: 'You could say that this bizarre design is just a continuation of the trend for wedged trainers.

'Isabel Marant was the first to put the heel into the trainer and now Nike and high street brands have followed suit.

'Jared Leto described Scott as "a creative genius" but I am not so sure I agree, I think these are tacky, look extraordinarily uncomfortable and should be reserved for younger stars such as Cara Delevingne and Rihanna who have the only chance of carrying this look off.'

Quirky: Jeremy Scott and Adidas already have some questionable footwear on offer

Thomas Merrigan, Menswear Writer at 
OxbloodAndWolf.Wordpress.com, added: 'Jeremy Scott never fails to push 
the boundaries of cringeworthy with his garments. These are no exceptions
 to that rule.

'The trend of adapted high heel trainers like this started years ago with counterfeit Air Jordan pairs.

'They are ugly as sin and this is exactly what Jeremy Scott thrives on for his ever eccentric, yet pop-cultured, shock factor.'

Remember these? Timberland gave heeled boots a spin a few years ago and they didn't exactly catch on

Continuing the theme for giving a hint of height to an otherwise usually flat shoe Mui Mui models wore wellies with a sturdy looking heel on the catwalk today.

The transparent shoes came in green and blue versions and were shown as part of the designers ready to wear fall/winter 2014-2015 collection.
