The days of carrying bottles of suncream to the beach could be over, as the world's first drinkable SPF is launched.

Harmonised H20 UV claims to provide holidaymakers with up to factor 30 protection, meaning sunbathers could be able to soak up the rays for longer without fear of getting burned.

Once ingested, the product's liquid molecules vibrate on the skin, cancelling out 97 per cent of UVA and UVB rays, according to US company Osmosis Skincare.

Increased protection: The new liquid could mean sunbathers could soak up the rays for longer

Drinkable sun cream: The two liquids - tanning and non-tanning - are on sale costing £17

The liquid sunscreen - which claims to be the world's first - is on sale now, costing £17 for a 100ml bottle.

There are two varieties available - 'tanning' and 'non tanning', the former allows users achieve a tan while being protected from harmful sun rays, the company states.

However, the US company does admit that none of its claims have been approved by the Federal Drugs Agency.

On its website, the medical skincare brand advises: 'Take 2ml every 4 hours while in the sun (preferably with 2+ oz of water). 

'Wait 1 hour before exposure to the sun. Monitor sun exposure carefully. 

'Take second dose if still in sun 3 hours after first dose.

'For extended intense exercise outdoors or if taking sun-sensitizing medications, use alternate protection after 30-40 minutes.'

Dr Ben 
Johnson, who founded the company, adds in his blog: 'If 2 mls are 
ingested an hour before sun exposure, the frequencies that have been 
imprinted on water will vibrate on your skin in such a way as to cancel 
approximately 97% of the UVA and UVB rays before they even hit your 
skin. 

'This results in coverage for approximately three hours.  

'This is similar to the amount of UV 
reflection created by SPF 30 titanium/zinc sunblocks but distinctly 
better than UVB chemical sunscreens which prevent certain damage that 
leads to the visible/painful/inflammation reaction we identify as sun 
damage.'

Harmonised H20 is yet to be endorsed by 
dermatologist bodies, however, the company website does carry 
testimonials for the product.

The end for lotion? The new drinkable liquid offers up to factor 30 protection

One, submitted via Facebook, said: 'I tested the UV Protection Harmonized Water (my skin burns in 15 minutes w/o sunscreen so i was nervous) SUCCESS!! I was outside for 2 hours with NO sunscreen during peak hours and wasn't even pink!

'My year and a half year old drinks it as well and hasn't burned once this summer and is outside everyday! Thank You, Thank You for this product!' 

Hermoine Lawson, spokesman at the British Skin Foundation, said: 'We would advise extreme caution of any product claiming UV protection using methods not supported by clinical research. 

'When it comes to an issue as serious as preventing skin cancer, customer testimonials cannot take the place of scientific evidence, for which this particular product cannot provide.

'Children's skin is particularly sensitive and therefore more prone to damage from UV rays, so it is even more important to stick to the tried and tested methods of sun protection when it comes to protecting their skin.'
