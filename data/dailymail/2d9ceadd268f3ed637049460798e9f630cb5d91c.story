ENGLAND and Harlequins rugby star Ugo Monye has told Sam Allardyce to shut up and stick to topics he knows about after the West Ham manager attacked the conduct of rugby players.

Allardyce believes footballers are only so heavily criticised for their behaviour because people are jealous – and he singled out rugby players in particular for escaping scrutiny.

The Hammers boss said: ‘I think that football is a volatile contest so people will lose their temper, but nobody seems to highlight the fact that rugby players stamp on each other's heads, gouge each other's eyes, and that seems to be acceptable.

On the defensive: Ugo Monye was unhappy with Allardyce's comments and told his twitter followers

‘There’s a lot of jealousy around the way football is in this country, and as it’s known as the peoples’ game, then I think more and more people complain about the price, whereas all the other sports it’s not quite the same.'

Monye was offended by those comments and the former British and Irish Lion – a lifelong Arsenal fan – tweeted: ‘Sam Allardyce should probably only talk on topics that he knows about and stick to coaching west ham and keep his mouth shut about rugby...’

Former England hooker Brian Moore also added his weight to the argument, tweeting: ‘I'm not jealous Mr Allardyce. I can sit where I want, with a beer & without fear; the day I can't I'll walk away from rugby not make excuses.’

Northampton’s Christian Day added: ‘Sam Allardyce horribly missing the point. Respect for officials, fans or just each other sadly lacking in your sport.’

The comments from the Hammers boss come only days after Gloucester back row Andy Hazell was cited for a brutal assault on prop from French club Mont-de-Marsan who he claims tried to gouge him.

Speaking ahead of West Ham's Barclays Premier League clash against Southampton on Saturday, Allardyce continued: 'Fans go to watch ice hockey players beat themselves up with the sticks and that also seems acceptable, but a footballer kicks somebody, or does something that’s slightly untoward to the rules and it’s "lock them away, ban them for life".'

‘So, it’s something we have to live with. In comparing it to the Olympics, it’s not as fierce a competition, because there’s not that day-to-day, week-to-week, competitive edge.

'It’s a build-up of four years – a very dedicated four years of course – and the delight of winning and the end of it must be one of the biggest highs anybody’s ever experienced.’
