Sophie Countess of Wessex had to put hygiene ahead of style today as she visited an eye hospital during her week-long tour of India. Â 

The royal, 48, pulled protective blue shoe covers on over her feet as she entered the operating theatre at the Susrut Eye Foundation in Kolkata, West Bengal.

The hospital is an advanced eye care unit and the mother-of-two had the opportunity to learn about the sight-saving treatments they carry out.

She even had the chance to also try her hand at cataract surgery using a simulator.

The Countess had her blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail but was not asked to don any other scrubs than the shoe covers.

She wore a palm tree print dress with a silver jacket and matching clutch bag and had a purple pashmina draped around her neck.

She visited the hospital with the charity ORBIS, who work in developing countries to save sight.

Later she dressed up in an embellished top as she attended a reception for ORBIS volunteers at the ITC Sonar Hotel

Susrut is an advanced ophthalmology eye care instituition and during her solo visit to India the Countess is supporting the sight saving charity ORBIS

They
launched the India childhood blindness initiative in 2002 to help 
ensure that the country's children have access to quality eye care.

Sophie was able to see the progress 
the initiative has been making and met patients who have benefited from 
the technology and medical expertise at the facility.

The
visit came on day three of the Countess's week-long trip to India that 
she is undertaking without her husband Prince Edward.

Yesterday, she saw how the eye medics are reaching people in poverty-stricken areas using a plane that has been converted into a flying opthalmic hospital and training facility.

Sophie met patients, staff and volunteers on board the converted DC-10 Aircraft which ORBIS uses to improve eye care for people in rural communities.

Later the same day, she put on her glad rags to attend a reception at the Kolkata Hotel. She wore a silk black and silver print wrap dress and carried the same silver bag she was seen with today.

On the first day of her visit, Sophie met orphaned children from Kolkata who are being supported by the charity Future Hope.
