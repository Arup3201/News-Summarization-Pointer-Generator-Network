Housework is just one of those things that needs doing.

So when one of your pets seems intent on interrupting, the pain of spending time on chores feels all the greater.

In this amusing video, an inquisitive hound appears put out by an addition to his lair - the trusty vacuum. 

Vela eyes up the vacuum cleaner as it tries its hardest to protect her surroundings

Jumping up and snaring its jaws around the hose, Vela spends the next minute and a half defending its space, pawing and slapping at the 'enemy'.

The dog follows the vacuum around the kitchen area, not prepared to give its owner a minute's grief from the tidying. 

The sound of the electrical device confuses the protective pooch, not realising that it's all in aid of improving its home. 

The Daily Puppy believes dogs are scared of vacuums for a number of reasons.

Lack of exposure, fearful disposition, a feeling that it is a 'monster on wheels' and a herding instinct are all reason why a dog may engage with the appliance.

'For starters, vacuums make odd noises,' states the Daily Puppy.

'Add to that the fact that you are thrusting it around using erratic movements and that it's long trunk is sucking all sorts of things from the floor. No animal in the wild does anything like that.'

The protective pooch is unsure of the vacuum's motives and tries to clasp its jaws around the hose
