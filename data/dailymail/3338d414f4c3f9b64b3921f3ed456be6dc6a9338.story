The former East German communist regime forced prisoners to donate blood for sale to the West and make goods for many companies across the Cold War frontier,  German media has reported.

Among customers in the West were not just furniture maker Ikea, as previously reported, but also discount supermarket chain Aldi, auto giant Volkswagen and other firms, claimed a television report broadcast last night.

The new revelations from the 1970s and 80s were screened by public broadcaster ARD and are based on a historian's review of files of East Germany's Stasi secret police and interviews.

The former East German communist regime forced prisoners to donate blood for sale to the West and make goods for many companies across the Cold War frontier,  German media has reported

Terror: The Stasi secret police, the Berlin HQ of which is pictured here, allegedly forced political prisoners to work for the store

The German Democratic Republic (GDR), desperate for hard currency, sold the prisoners' blood through a Swiss middleman to the Red Cross branch of the southern German state of Bavaria, said the report.

Former GDR health official Rudolf Uhlig told the program that prison visits were 'well worth the effort ... because every time we had 60-70 blood donors, and that was a pretty good success'.

The Bavarian Red Cross confirmed to the 'Report Mainz' program that it bought GDR blood in the 1980s, voicing 'deep regret', but said it was unclear whether it was then aware the blood came from prisoners.

Is is claimed customers in the West included auto giant Volkswagen and other firms, according to a television report broadcast last night

Supermarket chain Aldi told the programme that at the time it sourced women's stockings from an East German company, but said it did not know the manufacturer employed female prison labour

Stasi files indicated that the inmates were given no choice, citing an informant's report that nurses once refused to cooperate as they realised 'the poor prisoners ... were surely all compelled'.

Historian Tobias Wunschik told the programme that 'it was part of the logic of the system ... that you not only exploited prisoners' labour but ... also physically took their blood and sold it in the West'.

Wunschik, who led the state-commissioned study, also said hundreds of Western firms, more than previously known, bought goods from the GDR, a German-speaking, geographically close 'low-wage country'.

'In many cases this included goods 
made by prison labour,' Wunschik was quoted as saying, estimating the 
annual trade in jailhouse products was worth at least 200 million 
deutschmarks ($A152 million today).

Supermarket
 chain Aldi told the programme that at the time it sourced women's 
stockings from an East German company, but said it did not know the 
manufacturer employed female prison labour.

In 2012 IKEA expressed regret that it benefited from the use of forced prison labour by some of its suppliers in communist East Germany more than two decades ago

Volkswagen bought auto parts partially made under similar conditions but the auto giant also told the program it did not know at the time prison labour was involved.

The Commissioner for Stasi Records, Roland Jahn, demanded German companies now open their archives to help clear up past wrongs, saying: 'Those who did business with the dictatorship could never be certain under which conditions the products were made.'

In 2012 IKEA expressed regret that it had 
benefited from the use of forced prison labour by some of its suppliers 
in communist East Germany more than two decades ago. 

The
 Swedish furniture giant released a report showing that East German 
prisoners, among them many political dissidents, were involved in the 
manufacture of goods that were supplied to IKEA 25 to 30 years ago.

The
 report concluded that IKEA managers were aware of the possibility that 
prisoners would be used in the manufacture of its products and took some
 measures to prevent this, but they were insufficient.

'We deeply regret that this could happen,' said Jeanette Skjelmose, an IKEA manager.

'The use of political prisoners for manufacturing was at no point accepted by IKEA.'

But
 she added that 'at the time we didnâ€™t have the well-developed control 
system that we have today and we clearly did too little to prevent such 
production methods.'
