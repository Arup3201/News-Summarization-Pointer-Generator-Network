America takes its ski destination names seriously.

And one rebranding exercise saw a lawsuit between two popular ski areas in the US, after Salt Lake City, Utah, named itself Ski City USA.

The name somewhat overshadowed Steamboat Springs, Colorado, which has long been known as Ski Town USA.

The 100-year-old town of Steamboat Springs has been known as 'Ski Town USA' since 1959

Colorado's Steamboat Ski & Resort, which had been known as Ski Town since 1959, soon launched a federal lawsuit alleging a trademark violation. 

'They are attempting to leverage our brand and our brand equity,' Steamboat's SVP of sales and marketing, Rob Perlman, was quoted as saying last month.

Visit Salt Lake, however, argued that their winter marketing campaign, which cost approximately USD$1.8 million (£1.15 million), simply highlighted the differences between urban and rural ski destinations.

'Just as each ski town has its individual traits and attributes, Ski City USA is unique,' read a statement issued from Visit Salt Lake in October.

Initially, tourism board, Visit Salt Lake protested the cease and desist. Pictured: Deer Valley ski resort, near Salt Lake City

'Ski City USA provides a distinct alternative to the ski town experience.'

Further details of the settlement, which was reached on November 14, remain confidential but nevertheless, Visit Salt Lake has agreed to drop the 'USA' from the name, going by 'Ski City' instead. 

Steamboat Ski & Resort Corp. has, in return, dropped the lawsuit.

'Steamboat appreciates Visit Salt Lake's willingness to revise their campaign in order to address the concerns that resulted in a court filing,' explained Steamboat's SVP of sales and marketing, Rob Perlman. 

'We are pleased to have resolved this matter amicably before the start of the winter season and I want to thank Visit Salt Lake for working with us so quickly.'

True to their word, Visit Salt Lake has amended its website, but insists that the campaign's aim remains the same.

'The Ski City campaign is unique and will continue to promote a distinct alternative experience - the benefits of an urban community teeming with restaurants, professional sports teams, cultural offerings and abundant hotel options,' Visit Salt Lake CEO Scott Beck said.

'Visit Salt Lake recognizes that towns like Steamboat Springs are iconic in what they offer to winter enthusiasts and is pleased to reach an agreement on this matter to further distinguish these two unique locations.'

During the 2013 season, Salt Lake City and its surrounding ski hills hosted hosted 4.1 million skier visits.
