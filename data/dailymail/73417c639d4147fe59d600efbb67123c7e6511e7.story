A longtime volunteer with an animal protection organization in New Jersey has pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges.

Authorities found more than 300 dead birds and animals in the Little 
Silver home of 56-year-old Gretchen Rell's 95-year-old mother.

Her
 attorney said Rell was overwhelmed by the number of animals in her 
care. She had volunteered with the Monmouth County Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Gretchen Rell, 56, pleaded guilty on Monday to stockpiling the carcasses of dead animals in the basement of her mother's home in New Jersey

Rell
 entered her plea on Monday. The Asbury Park Press reported 
that under terms of the plea agreement, Rell
 will be sentenced to probation in September.

She'll also have to 
undergo mental health treatment, serve 30 days of community service, 
have no contact with the SPCA and shall not own, reside with or take 
into care or custody any pet.

'She never intended to harm any of the birds, she just got completely overwhelmed,' Rellâ€™s defense attorney, Dennis Melofchick told app.com.

Rell
 was indicted in May for animal cruelty after police said she hoarded
 hundreds of pigeons, small mammals, turtles and other creatures in her 
95-year-old mother's $1 million home only to let them starve and die.

Authorities said the smell was
 horrific in the Little Silver home where Gretchen Rell allegedly had 
the decomposed creatures stacked five-feet high unbeknown to her mother,
 whom she was told to 'never go into the basement'.

Many
 of the animals that Rell, a 20-plus year volunteer at the Monmouth 
County SPCA, left to wither in the home and garage were still sealed in 
their original carrying crates.

'Never go in the basement': Authorities say they found animals stacked 5-feet-high from floor to ceiling in the basement of her mother's home, where she warned her never to go

Gretchen Rell, 56, pleaded guilty on Monday to hoarding the carcasses of hundreds of animals at her 95-year-old mother's New Jersey home. She will be sentenced to probation and undergo mental health treatment

Authorities first discovered the stomach-turning stash of creatures back in March.

'We have more than 300 animals and counting,' Monmouth SPCA's chief law officer Victor Amato told the Asbury Park Press. 'Ninety-nine percent are dead birds. Most of them are seagulls, pigeons, robins, wrens and loons.'

Investigators say they also found turtles, mice, rabbits, possums and other mammals too decomposed to identify 'stacked from floor to ceiling, five feet high,' according to Amato.

Rell's LinkedIn account lists her occupation as MCSPCA Wildlife Coordinator since April 1992.

'I am in charge of placing injured or orphaned wildlife with State Licensed Wildlife Rehabilitators,' Rell writes in the job description. 'I am also in charge of transportation to those rehabbers and facilities.'

Authorities
 say that instead of following through with her job and getting the sick
 and injured animals treatment, she took them home and allowed them to 
dehydrate, starve and perish.

Rell
 was once seen by a number chasing down and capturing an injured seagull
 on her mother's street, one neighbor told the Asbury Park Press. Area 
children were also known take injured animals to Rell.

Some
 neighbors had begun to wonder what Rell was really up to by the time of
 her March arrest and there were complaints of smells coming from her 
mother's home.

The home contained the decomposing bodies of mostly pigeons but also contained various seabirds and ducks, possums, rabbits and mice--many of them in their original sealed crates from a rescue organization

So how did she get away with hoarding so many creatures for so long?

'To be honest,' said Amato, 'when you were upstairs, you could smell a slight odor. It wouldn't be what you would expect with 300 dead animals.'

Rell's own residence, where she lives with her husband, is in nearby Ocean Township.

Authorities visited that residence and say they found 60 additional animals.

On Monday, Rell was indicted in Ocean Township on two counts of third-degree animal cruelty, rerports Philly.com.

The maximum possible sentence for the counts is five years behind bars. But even her accusers likely won't push for such a punishment.

'Gretchen was well intended. She is a nice person,' Amato told the Asbury Park Press in March. 'But what happens is they get overwhelmed and don't know how to ask for help. They get carried away. It's hoarding, no matter what.'
