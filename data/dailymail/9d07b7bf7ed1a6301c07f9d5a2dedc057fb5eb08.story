Former Chicago police commander Jon Burge has been released from a Florida halfway house after 4 ½ years in federal custody for lying about the torture of suspects.

Darlene Tyler, the residential re-entry manager at the Orlando-area facility, says Burge was released Friday, a day early, because his scheduled release date fell on a weekend.

More than 100 people have accused Burge and officers under his command of shocking, suffocating and beating them into giving false confessions in the 1970s and 1980s.

Some of the victims were given electric shocks as they were forced to confess, they claimed.

Burge was convicted of perjury for lying to a jury in 2003 when he claimed he had no knowledge of violent methods being used to extract confessions.

He was not put on trial for torture because the statute of limitations had expired.

One victim, Madison Hobley, who was sentenced to death for a 1987 fire that killed seven people including his wife and son, claimed he had a plastic typewriter cover put over his head so he couldn’t breathe.

Burge denied knowing anything about the ‘bagging’ or taking part in it.

However, Mr Hobley was later pardoned.

Ronald Kitchen, who was freed from prison after 21 years when it was proven that the senior officer had coerced him into falsely confessing to murder, said the officer deserved a long spell in jail.

‘He was our Al Qaeda, he was our bin Laden in our neighborhood,’ he said. 

The allegations against the 63-year-old and his men even helped shape the state's debate over the death penalty.

Former Illinois Governor George Ryan released four condemned men from death row in 2003 after Ryan said Burge extracted confessions from them using torture.

The allegations of torture and coerced confessions eventually led to a brief moratorium on Illinois' death penalty. 

The 67-year-old Burge served most of his sentence in federal prison in North Carolina. 

He spent his final months at the halfway house.
