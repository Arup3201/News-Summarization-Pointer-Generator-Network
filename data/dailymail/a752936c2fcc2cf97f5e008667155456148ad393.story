Adam Lallana is missing his own expensive stag do in order to present England boss Roy Hodgson with a selection problem at the World Cup.

The Southampton midfielder is part of the 23-man squad to travel to Brazil.

And despite forking out £50,000 on a week-long party, Lallana refused to go, reports the Sun.

Professional: Adam Lallana has missed his stag do in Miami in a bid to be fighting fit for the World Cup

Missing link? Lallana could become a key player for Roy Hodgson when they start the tournament in June

The 26-year-old splashed out on the holiday this time last year ahead of his wedding.

But when it became clear he might have a chance of being called up to the England squad, Lallana decided to marry fianceé Emily Jubb in December.

The remainder of the group still went to Miami regardless, where they stayed in a five-star villa.

A friend told the Sun: 'Obviously he is gutted he isn't there with them all but he knows that he has to be on top form for Brazil and he's going to give it his all.

'Most of the lads that went have known him all his life and they've always supported him - so he wanted to give something back to them.'

Doing their bit: Lallana joined a plethora of internationals to benefit the England Footballers Foundation on Sunday
