Big money: Chief executive David Higgins could pocket an annual bonus of £700,000, on top of his £560,000 salary, £160,660 pension payments and £15,000 additional benefits

Bosses at Network Rail could be in line for bonuses worth 125 per cent of their salary, according to a leaked memo.

It means NR chief executive David Higgins could pocket an annual bonus of as much as £700,000, on top of his £560,000 salary, £160,660 pension payments and £15,000 additional benefits.

The news will infuriate commuters and 
train travellers facing huge hikes in rail fares for an 'inadequate 
service', in which trains are often overcrowded and more than 40 per 
cent do not arrive on time.

The train company's top bosses already receive bonuses of up to 60 per cent of their salary - but they have now brought in consultants from Deloitte to advise on pay packages.

Deloitte said the average package in the 'outside world' includes a yearly bonus of 75 per cent of an executive's salary and a long-term bonus equivalent to half of their annual pay.

It also said that NR's pension benefits were at the median to lower end of the scale.

The proposed pay package seen by the Daily Telegraph would also push the take-home pay of three other NR directors to more than £1million.

Operations director Robin Gisby, financial director Patrick Butcher and infrastructure director Simon Kirby would all receive bonuses of around £450,000 a year, plus 'golden handcuff' payments of £300,000, intended to stop them leaving.

They would also be handed long-term bonuses of up to £350,000 for 2009-2011, while Mr Higgins does not qualify for this yet because he only got the top job in February 2011.

Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘Commuters facing nine per cent fare rises will be outraged at the scale of the bonus packages being enjoyed by a few at the top of the rail industry.

‘It will be unacceptable if payouts on this scale are made when performance remains deeply inadequate, with many passengers facing overcrowded services and too many delayed and cancelled trains.

‘The Government should sit down with Network Rail and look again at whether a bonus scheme on this scale is really appropriate in a company funded by the taxpayer by more than three billion pounds every year.’

The news comes after NR bosses gave up their bonuses last year, amid pressure to reduce high payouts at a time of public sector austerity.

Manuel Cortes, head of the TSSA rail union, said: 'While passengers struggle to cope with ever rising rail fares, it is simply scandalous that they should be looking to reward themselves with double your money bonuses at a publicly funded company.

'These executives are living in cloud cuckoo land if they think the taxpayers are going to fund this blueprint to make themselves millionaires at our expense.'

NR executives are some of the highest paid in the public sector, as the head of its remuneration committee admitted at a meeting in December.

But Graham Eccles stressed that they remain in the 'lower quartile' of private sector organisations, and the company needs to be able to attract and retain top employees.

A Network Rail spokesperson confirmed that Deloitte had offered advice to a meeting of its members, but said: 'No decision on bonuses has been made by the remuneration committee and therefore any figures are pure speculation.

'Our pay structure is agreed by the Office of Rail Regulation and any future award of bonuses will depend on company performance.'

The final pay packages will be agreed upon at a meeting in May or June.
