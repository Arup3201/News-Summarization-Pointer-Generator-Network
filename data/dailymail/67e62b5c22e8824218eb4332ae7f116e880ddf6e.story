A wrestling champion used the skills he honed in the ring to subdue a suspected thief he saw leaving his Phoenix home with week.

When WWE star Bryan Danielson - known as Daniel Bryan in the ring - saw two men leaving his house on Thursday night he quickly gave chase, and was able to stop one suspect by using a wrestling hold.

Danielson is known for his signature Yes hold during World Wrestling Entertainment events, but in this instance he used a 'rear naked choke hold' to stop Cesar Sosa, 22.

That's when Danielson and his wife -  WWE star Brie Bella - ran inside to check on their dog, Josie.

'I saw the guys running out the back. I chased them. I caught one of them. I kept him until police got there,' Danielson said.

Danielson and Sosa  got into a struggle, but the former champ subdued him until officers arrived, Phoenix police sergeant Tommy Thompson said. The second suspect got away.

The former champ said he didn't have to apply the Yes! lock to get Sosa to surrender, but he did put him in a rear naked choke hold.

'Unfortunately, he wasn't in very good shape, so it didn't take much,' Danielson said.

Sosa was arrested and faces a burglary charge. It was not known if he had an attorney who could be reached for comment.

Thompson said Sosa also had a felony warrant for burglary and kidnapping in another case.

Danielson, who was returning from the airport, said he was grateful that his neighbors had called 911 to report suspicious activity about 10 minutes before the couple arrived home.

'I got really angry at first. They're actually lucky that I got them instead of Brie, because she probably would have been a little more violent,' he said.

He added that despite being usually mild-mannered, the break in and felt like an invasion and he just reacted angrily to it, Danielson told TMZ.

'Warning others against reacting the same way, Danielson said: 'I'm a little borderline ashamed. It's probably not the best thing to do because you don't know what will happen.'

Brianna Danielson said that while her husband chased after the intruders, she found their dog, Josie, hiding in the couple's bathroom.

'We didn't know if they had Josie, too,' she said.

They were able to retrieve some of their belongings, including an engraved bracelet that Danielson's father had given him just before he died.

Danielson, known for his Yes! chants, is taking a break from wrestling while he recovers from an injury.
