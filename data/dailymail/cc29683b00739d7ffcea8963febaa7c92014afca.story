Google has joined an effort to warn thousands of users around the world that the internet will suddenly 'turn off' on 9 July of this year.

The internet search-engine giant will set up alerts visible to the roughly 350,000 PC users with infected computers when they use its search results page as a warning that their machines have an invisible, undetectable 'Trojan' computer virus called DNSChanger.

Google's decision to lend help comes as the FBI, which detected the infection and established 'surrogate' servers to keep infected PCs working, plans to 'pull the plug' in July as a cost-cutting measure.

Warning: Google will set up alerts visible for the roughly 350,000 PC users that their computers are infected with a virus on its search results page

Around 350,000 PC users have machines infected with an invisible, undetectable 'Trojan' computer virus sending users to unintended and illegal sites

Google plans to alert more than 500,000 people in a week of the virus, which sends users of the Web to unintended - and sometimes illegal - sites.

Damian Menscher, a Google social engineer, wrote in his blog that the search engine's initiative will reach a wider range of people as half the affected computers are owned by those who do not speak English.

'Our goal with this notification is to raise awareness of DNSChanger among affected users,' he wrote. 'We believe directly messaging affected users on a trusted site and in their preferred language will produce the best possible results.'

The search-engine company hopes to reach out to many of the users who have no idea their computers are even infected.

Infected: The Trojan 'DNSChanger' could cause millions - including Fortune 500 companies - to lose their Internet if the FBI shuts down surrogate servers

According to RT Network, servers function by translating traditional website URLs to their ‘numeric counterpart.’

But computers with the Trojan, which originally emerged in Estonia, will send users to fraudulent websites.

And, if the FBI shuts off their emergency servers, millions of people could potentially be without Internet.

The temporary servers set up by the FBI were created to allow companies to remove the worm from their infected servers; those affected had 120 days to get rid of the malware.

After FBI warnings, the number of PCs infected with the Trojan has plunged - and most are in the hands of private individuals, not companies.

Court order: The FBI will retire their surrogate servers by March 8

Ticking clock: The FBI's surrogate servers can run until March 8, at which point they will either have to be shut down or run by a court-ordered extension

Of the 350,000 infected machines worldwide, 85,000 are in the U.S and 20,000 are in the UK.

The malware is especially effective, Gizmodo reports, because it blocks infected users from visiting secure sites that could help them rid of the worm.

Law enforcement officials and the computer industry have been working together in a coalition to fight the malware.

The group, called the DNSChanger Working Group, will examine possibilities to fixing the problem.

If no solution is reached, millions of people could be without the Internet, RT reports.
