Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg last night accomplished a task that proved beyond them in the previous 25 days — talk to one another.

The two Mercedes men have spoken publicly — and to their engineers — about each other since the latest hiccup in relations happened at the last race in Hungary on July 27, when Hamilton refused to follow a team instruction to let Rosberg pass.

Rosberg described Hamilton’s stubbornness as ‘not good’ —strong words coming from Formula One’s Henry Kissinger. But Hamilton, speaking ahead of Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix, is not in a mood to apologise.

Tension: Hamilton and Rosberg are not on the best of terms currently

‘I don’t feel I owe him anything,’ said the Brit, who is 11 points behind Rosberg in the drivers’ championship. ‘I’m not sure we need to talk. I wasn’t really involved much in his race and he did not get close enough to overtake. They said don’t hold him up, but he was never on my tail.

‘I made it hard for him to pass. That’s my job.

‘There was not right or wrong. I’m not upset with the team and they are not upset with me. I like to think I handled it quite well. I heard someone said I defied team orders.

‘It’s different when you’re sitting in the car and someone tells you that you need to react. You are not in as clear a moment as when you’re sitting here at the table. The team know I was right.’

Staying quiet: Rosberg doesn't want to heat up the fued anymore by adding more details

Rosberg, true to his diplomatic mien, said: ‘I gather it was a bit of a mess (in the media) after Hungary so it’s best I don’t add too much and not give too many details.’

He did not excuse Hamilton. The feud continues.

It is difficult to apportion total blame, for while Hamilton should really follow instructions from the pit wall, the order was arguably unrealistic given the two drivers’ proximity in the standings and, as Hamilton argued at the time, the fact that Rosberg was not right on his team-mate’s gearbox.

Britain’s Max Chilton, of Marussia, will sit out this race because of ‘contractual issues’, terminology which was widely perceived here as code for ‘run out of money’.

He pays for his seat — worth an estimated £5million — through his father Grahame, an insurance magnate.

Defiant: Hamilton insists he did nothing wrong by not letting Rosberg pass him

Max, 23, turned up at Spa in a black 4x4 and posed for photos with supporters, hoping to thrash out a last-minute deal to allow him to drive.

It was not to be, and his place will be taken, for this race at least, by Alexander Rossi, a 21-year-old American with GP2 experience.

‘Although it was not our intention to offer Alexander the possibility to race this season, in light of the circumstances we are pleased to be providing him with the opportunity to make his debut,’ said Marussia team principal John Booth.

‘Naturally we hope to resume normal service with respect to our established race driver line-up as soon as possible.

Marussia are a team without a big budget even if their owner is venture capitalist Andrey Cheglakov, a Russian billionaire.
