Vigilante justice is rising in one of America’s most violent cities as residents in crime-ridden neighbourhoods take matters into their own hands.

Detroit, Michigan, saw 34 self-defence killings in 2011 - a 79 per cent increase from the previous year, according to statistics in The Daily.

The 'justifiable homicides' rate is 2,200 per cent above the U.S. average, as citizens cope with alarmingly high response times and police cuts.

Residents are resorting to 
self-defence as police response times lag to 24 minutes for 
priority calls on average, Mara Gay wrote in The Daily.

That compares to an average of ten minutes in comparable cities across the rest of the country.

An FBI report shows Detroit homicides 
ranked second in the nation per capita last year, rising ten per cent in
 2011 to 344 people.

The Detroit police department rolled out a plan in January to close precincts and district headquarters to the public after 4pm.

This was an effort to put more 
officers on patrol, especially in the most besieged neighbourhoods, 
without adding to the city's $200million deficit.

The policy took effect in an especially tough area on the city's east side and spread to the six other stations.

And citizens are taking the law into 
their own hands, arming themselves with guns and guard dogs to fend off 
criminals, Ms Gay wrote in The Daily.

Detroit resident Julia Brown, 73, told
 the website the last time she called local police, authorities didn't 
respond until the following day.

'We got to have a little Old West up here
 in Detroit. That’s what it’s gonna take. I don’t intend to 
be one of their victims, I’m planning on taking one out'

Now she carries a handgun to defend herself against criminals she says are terrorising her neighbourhood.

'We got to have a little Old West up 
here in Detroit. That’s what it’s gonna take,' she said. 'I don’t intend
 to be one of their victims, I’m planning on taking one out.'

Kevin Early said he found himself in a similar situation in November when he was held up at gunpoint in Rosedale Park.

He recalled neighbours in the middle-class neighbourhood emerging from the street with shotguns as his attackers fled on foot.

Neighbours helped out: Kevin Early was held up by gunmen outside his house in a desirable area of Detroit three months ago and cops took 25 minutes to arrive

It was 25 minutes before an officer 
arrived to the scene. But like many police departments, Detroit's force 
is under severe financial constraints.

Immigration officer Alvin Davis was fed up in 2009 with
break-ins at his mother’s house despite her constant calls to Detroit police.

The ex-federal agent spent days hunting down and harassing
the teenagers allegedly robbing his mother, prosecutors said.

He even put his gun into one of their mouths and
got a four-year jail term for unlawful imprisonment and assault, reported The
Daily.

Kevin Early was held up by gunmen outside his house in a
desirable area three months ago and cops took 25 minutes to
arrive.

The criminal justice expert reasoned with his attackers for
20 minutes before he thought they would shoot him, so he ran off.

Neighbours emerged from the Detroit street’s other posh homes with
shotguns as the attackers fled, reported The Daily.

The city has about 2,700 officers, down from 4,000 a decade ago. There are few areas to make cuts other than jobs.

But authorities are loath to do this, 
particularly in light of the city's violent crime rate, one of the 
highest in the country, and a spike in murders.

Compounding matters is Detroit's size 
of 139 sq miles, even though the population has fallen from 1.8million 
in 1950 to 700,000 today.

As The Daily reports, residents in 
wealthier areas are also often hiring private security firms to patrol 
their streets in armoured trucks.

Business owners at Threat Management Group and Recon Security, which patrol neighbourhoods, said business is booming.

A spokesman for Detroit Police told 
The Daily they are working on lowering response times, and said citizens
 do have a right to defend themselves.

‘It’s not about police response time 
because often the act has already taken place by the time the police are
 called,’ Sgt Eren Stephens said.
