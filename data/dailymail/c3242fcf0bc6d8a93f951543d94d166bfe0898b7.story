It has withstood some of the bloodiest moments in history.

But last night, the iconic Micklegate Bar in York, finally met its match with a Marks and Spencer delivery lorry.

Fire crews had to cut the enormous vehicle out of the 12th century archway, after the lorry attempted to squeeze through late on Thursday.

Doh! Fire crews had to cut this enormous M&S lorry out of Micklegate Bar in York after it attempted to squeeze through late on Thursday

Its cab managed to clear the arch, which has a height restriction of 8ft 6ins, but its trailer was simply too big to fit and stuck fast.

After an investigation, City of York Council chiefs are positive the ancient entrance to the city has not been damaged by the lorry.

Micklegate Bar - Mykill meaning great and Gata meaning street - has a long history dating back to 1100s. It became the primary entrance to the city of York after its city walls were constructed.

During the Wars of the Roses from 1455 to 1485, when the rival houses of York and Lancaster battled for England's throne, the heads of Richard, Duke of York, his son the Earl of Rutland and the Earl of Salisbury, were all displayed on Micklegate Bar.

The following year they were replaced with the heads of the slain Lancastrian leaders.

Since 1389, in a tradition established by King Richard II, monarchs visiting York must formally request permission to enter the city at Micklegate Bar.

In light of this incident, it may be wise to apply the same rule to delivery drivers.

It is not the first time an M&S delivery lorry has got wedged.

Back in February, a driver got stuck on Lincoln High Street, after attempting to reverse into a store's loading bay behind St Benedicts Square.

It remained lodged between St Benedicts and Fat Face for four hours before being freed by another lorry.
