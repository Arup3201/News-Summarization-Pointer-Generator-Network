The body of a public schoolboy was discovered in his mother's 'jungle' of a back garden more than two months after he disappeared, an inquest heard today.

Miller Redpath, 17, was last seen after what was described as a 'difference of opinion' with his mother Anastasia Miller at their home in Wenhaston, near Halesworth, Suffolk.

He vanished on August 13, 2013, two days before he was due to receive his A Level results from £21,105-a-year Langley School in Loddon, Norfolk, where he was a weekly boarder.

The inquest in Lowestoft was told that his decomposed body was discovered in dense undergrowth in the garden of his mother's detached Victorian home on October 24.

In a statement given to the hearing, accountant Mrs Miller, who runs a real estate agency in Eastern Europe, described her back garden as 'a jungle full of dense plants, attracting butterflies and bees'.

She said she had made a thorough search of the garden  four days after her son disappeared, but found nothing.

Police also found no sign of Miller when they first searched the ivy-covered house on October 15, 2013, uncovering only a 'trick or treat' mask he had bought for Halloween.

However, his body was found during a second search by officers nine days later.

The inquest was told that Miller was identified from DNA tests, but a post mortem failed to establish how he died.

Suffolk Coroner Dr Peter Dean recorded an open conclusion after hearing how police believed that nobody else was involved in Miller's death and there were no suspicious circumstances.

Dr Dean told the inquest that entymology tests on insects at the spot where Miller was found showed that his body may have been there 'for much if not all of the time he had been missing'. 

At the time of Miller's disappearance, his widowed mother told police that items had gone missing from her home, leading to speculation that he had taken them and was too ashamed to get back in touch with her.

But no reference to the missing items was made during the inquest which heard only documentary evidence.

After her son vanished, Mrs Miller revealed  she last saw him alive early on August 13 when she left him 'grumpy' in bed.

The pair had been due to go to a Christian open air service together, but Mrs Miller ended up attending alone.

In her statement, she had described him as 'intelligent, enthusiastic, gregarious, confident and very popular' and an excellent sportsman who was keen on polo, martial arts and rugby and was 'physically and mentally strong'.

Miller was also a keen member of the Combined Cadet Force at his school, reflecting his family's strong military background, said Dr Dean.

The inquest heard that Miller also had a sensitive side and enjoyed opera and musical theatre and helping others in difficulty. He was also a chorister at school.

Dr Dean said Miller and his mother regularly had conversations about politics and other subjects.

But he added: 'As with anyone there were sometimes some difficult times, particularly as he was a strong willed young man.

'The early loss of his own father had an effect on him and there were conflicts in respect of things like smoking.

'There were some conflicts about him not being allowed to smoke at home and these conversations could clearly lead to differences of opinion between mother and son.

'We hear of a difference of opinion shortly before these very sad sequence of events took place.'

Dr Dean said that Mrs Miller and had a 'lovely day' together on August 12, the day before he disappeared.

He added that Mrs Miller was not overly concerned when he failed to come home by the evening of August 14 as he was a 'resourceful and intelligent' young man who was only two weeks short of his 18th birthday.

However, her concerns grew when he failed to get his A Level results the following day and she spent August 16 searching Lowestoft and Norwich for any sign of him.

She went on to make extensive public appeals to help find him, putting out messages nationally and internationally on social media.

Detective Inspector Kevin Hayward of Suffolk Police said in a statement that Miller's home was first searched when his missing person status was changed from medium to high.

Miller's cause of death was given as 'unascertained', and the coroner recorded an open verdict

The inquest heard how one villager had seen him on August 13 when he was waiting for a bus to go to Lowestoft for a hair cut. Another had gave him a lift home in the afternoon and he later made arrangements to meet a friend on August 15

A post mortem by Home Office pathologist Dr Ben Swift found no evidence of broken bones or injuries and gave his cause of death as 'unascertained'. There was also no evidence that he was a regular user of drugs, said Dr Dean.

He added: 'Although clearly we have evidence that the body had been there some considerable time, there is still uncertainty over the exact circumstances over which Miller came by his death.

'The post mortem was unable to give a definitive cause of death so sadly there remain unanswered and unanswerable questions. There is no evidence to suggest foul play or the involvement of any other person.'

Mrs Miller attended the hearing, but declined to comment afterwards.  

Mrs Miller said she had made a thorough search of the garden four days after her son disappeared, but found nothing, he was later found after two police searches
