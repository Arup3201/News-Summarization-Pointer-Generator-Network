President Francois Hollande appealed to foreign business to invest in France yesterday as his unpopular government tries to spur growth and create jobs.

Hosting 30 heads of French units of foreign companies at his Elysee Palace, Hollande pledged that taxes would not rise later and VAT and duty rules for firms would be streamlined this year.

The Socialist president, who last month announced France would phase out £25billion in charges on companies by 2017 to reverse its slide in competitiveness, also said French business taxes would be harmonised with those of its neighbours, especially Germany, by 2020.

'The objective is to ensure the stability of tax standards and mechanisms,' Hollande told leaders of Siemens, Samsung Electronics, Volvo, General Electric and Nestle, among others.

'I know that France, and this was confirmed by our discussions, is seen as a more complicated country than others.

'A business, whether French or foreign, that wants to invest will have a commitment from the administration that the tax rules will remain the same, and that will be a guarantee.'

The government believes a rebound in company investment can help boost growth in France’s Gross Domestic Product to at least 0.9 per cent this year after stagnation in 2013. It hopes that even such modest growth will help bring down joblessness from near 11 per cent.

Monday’s meeting aimed to reassure foreign business leaders unnerved by France’s high overall tax rate, history of tense industrial relations and frequent run-ins with business such as his government’s threat in 2012 to nationalise an ailing steel plant run by ArcelorMittal.

But his comments to the business leaders came the same day as a new law was introduced in parliament to impose tough fines on firms that shut operations still deemed economically viable.

The law was prompted by Hollande’s 2012 campaign promise to steelworkers at ArcelorMittal’s Florange blast furnaces in northern France that he would pass legislation to protect their jobs in case of a shutdown.

Despite a government threat to nationalise them, the furnaces were later closed.
