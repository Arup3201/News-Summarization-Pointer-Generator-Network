A widower in Florida says his church canceled his husband's funeral a day beforehand because parishioners found out he was gay and complained about the planned service.

Kendall Capers, of Tampa, says his partner of 17 years, Julion Evans-Capers, died late last month after a four-year battle against Amyloidosis, a rare illness that attacks the organs in the body. The couple was married last year in Maryland.

Mourners were already at Evans-Capers' wake when leaders at New Hope Missionary Baptist Church in Tampa started receiving calls from parishioners, who were angered when a local newspaper ran an obituary listing Capers and Evans as married.

The man's mother, Julie Atwood, was told that holding the funeral at the Christian church would be 'blasphemous' â€” and the family was sent packing, she says.

'I did feel like he was being denied the dignity of death,' Atwood told WFLA. 'It was devastating.'

Pastor T.W. Jenkins says his church, New Hope Missionary Baptist, preaches against gay marriage and that it 'would have been in error to allow the service'

The church's pastor, T. W. Jenkins, did not immediately reply to a MailOnline request for comment on Friday.

But the minister told WFLA that his 
faith preaches against gay marriage, and he canceled the service after 
members from his congregation called to complain.

'Based on 
our preaching of the scripture, we would have been in error to allow the
 service in our church,' Jenkins told the station. 'I'm not trying to 
condemn anyone's lifestyle, but at the same time, I am a man of God, and
 I have to stand up for my principles.'

Capers says his family scrambled to put another service together, but with just 24 hours notice, many mourners didn't make it to the new location.

The distraught husband said he would have understood the church's position had he been given enough notice.

No secret: the couple had been together for 17 years and tied the knot last year in Maryland. Kendall Capers says they were always open about being gay

'If you agree to something, three and four days later, agree to it and stick to your plan, don't change at the last minute because your church constituents are calling you, or the church members are calling you to complain,' Capers told FOX 13. 'Stand your ground.'

'I know there are other people that are probably going to be in the same shoes Julion and I were in,' he added.

'I feel like it's a wrong doing, and nobody should be in those shoes.'
