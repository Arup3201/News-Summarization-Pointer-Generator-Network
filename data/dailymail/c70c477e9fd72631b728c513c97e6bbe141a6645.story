Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the American-led invasion of Iraq left the country in chaos, in a rare criticism of Australia's strongest ally.  

Mr Abbott made the unusual remarks during a surprise visit to Baghdad. He has not ruled out sending more troops to the war-torn nation. 

'Iraq is a country which has suffered a very great deal. First, decades of tyranny under Saddam Hussein. Then, the chaos and confusion that followed the American-led invasion. 

'Most recently, the tumult, the dark age, which has descended upon Northern Iraq as a result of the Daesh death cult, but Australia will do what we can to help.'

Mr Abbott made a rare criticism of US foreign policy in Iraq, saying the aftermath of the invasion had left the country in 'chaos and confusion' 

On the third leg of an unannounced visit to the troubled region, Mr Abbott held talks with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in Dubai and visited an airbase.

'I certainly don't rule out doing what we reasonably can to make the world a safer place,' he said after the meeting.

Australia is part of the US-led coalition carrying out air strikes against ISIL in Iraq and has deployed special forces troops to assist in training the local army.

'Because the ISIL or Daesh death cult has declared war on the world, including here and Australia.'

Mr Abbott said he looked forward to further talks with Baghdad and coalition partners about what Australia 'can usefully do'.

The prime minister's latest comments and those he made after a meeting with Iraqi leader Haider Al-Abadi on Sunday have led to speculation Australia might be prepared to go beyond its limited commitment to the conflict.

Back home, the Labor opposition is holding back bipartisan support for any expanded role.

Instead it will wait for a detailed briefing from the government before revealing its position.

Mr Abbott also rejected criticism of the secrecy surrounding his visit to Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.

In a departure from previous practice, Australian media were excluded from covering the visit first-hand and were forced to rely on footage provided by the prime minister's office in Canberra.

The opposition accused the government of pursuing a culture of secrecy, saying it was not in the national interest.

But Mr Abbott said the media was excluded for 'understandable security reasons'.
