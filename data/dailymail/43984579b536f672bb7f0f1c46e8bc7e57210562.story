Liverpool, you have been warned. Prepare for an uncomfortable evening on the south coast on Wednesday.

You would have forgiven Bournemouth for being a little preoccupied by their upcoming Capital One Cup quarter-final glamour tie. Not one bit of it.

With five goals and five different goalscorers, they surged to the Championship summit and confirmed what we already suspected. The midweek trip here to take on old pal Eddie Howe will be far from easy for Brendan Rodgers and his mis-firing Reds.

They are a superb attacking force with goals coming from everywhere. Matt Ritchie, Harry Arter, Marc Pugh, Yann Kermorgant and Callum Wilson all scored here in a splendid advert for Championship football.

That Cardiff kept it so close for so long was testament to their fighting spirit - goals from Kenwyne Jones and two towering headers from Sean Morrison made things interesting - but in the end they were deservedly beaten.

It is an indication of Bournemouth's belief they can challenge for Premier League promotion that all mentions of Wednesday night's big match were banned. The Cup was for another day. Howe didn't give it a mention in his programme notes, nor did captain Tommy Elphick.

With Middlesbrough beating Derby County 2-0 at lunchtime, the Cherries knew they could finish the afternoon on top of the table and, despite the lure of Liverpool's visit, Howe didn't rest any players.

Russell Slade also sent out an unchanged team but to the displeasure of the travelling hordes from the Welsh capital, they were dressed in all-white. 'Are we Swansea in disguise?' was one of the more printable chants directed at owner Vincent Tan.

Wearing the colours of your bitter rival aside, their mood had been soured just 38 seconds in. From the game's first attack, Bournemouth led when Callum Wilson darted down the left and played across a ball that fell perfectly for the onrushing Ritchie to drill into the bottom corner. It was his third in four games.

'We score when we want,' crowed the jubilant home support. And very early, too, it would seem.

The hosts set the early tempo, with Charlie Daniels a willing runner from left-back in support of the creative players. Likewise Simon Francis on the right and his cross was deftly taken down by Pugh, whose shot was struck into the ground and bounced kindly for David Marshall.

Cardiff's form has undoubtedly improved since Slade replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but they still suffer from some travel sickness. It took them a good 20 minutes to get going, the lightweight Kim Bo-Kyung particularly liable to give the ball away.

Craig Noone showed some intent with a head-down charge towards the box but his effort flew high and wide. The brawny Jones showed good strength inside the danger zone but Elphick bravely slid in to snuff out his shot.

Two minutes before the break and Bournemouth doubled their lead with the best move of the first-half. Arter's fine pass out to the left found Daniels and his centre was touched on by Brett Pitman to Pugh.

Marshall came out and forced him wide but Pugh retained the ball, turned and found Arter, who'd ghosted into the box to fire into the bottom corner.

Then, their heads giddy with the prospect of going top, Bournemouth switched off and were punished. A long ball from the back wasn't dealt with by Steve Cook, who slipped and allowed Adam Le Fondre to sprint clear.

His cut-back was perfect for Jones, who finished from all of six yards out.

Seconds later and it was Cardiff's turn to switch off as Arter teed up Pugh to unleash a superb dipping shot that looped over Marshall and into the net, his sixth goal of the campaign.

Slade reshuffled a little at the break, replacing the ineffective Bo-Kyung with Kadeem Harris and the rewards were also instant as Cardiff again cut the deficit.

Peter Whittingham delivered the ball in from the left and Morrison soared above the Bournemouth defence to direct a thumping header past Artur Boruc into the bottom corner.

Then a moment of controversy as Bournemouth claimed Marshall handled outside the box after rushing out to stop Wilson reaching a cross. Referee James Adcock - and his assistant when consulted - sided with the goalkeeper.

The game was suddenly on a knife-edge and Ritchie, who always carried a threat for Bournemouth, flashed a 20-yard hit wide just before the hour following another neat passing move.

Then, a moment of magic from Kermorgant restored the two-goal cushion. Pugh was fouled by Matt Connolly just outside the box and the Frenchman, who had replaced Pitman, curled a beautiful free-kick into the top corner.

Surely the contest was all over this time? No. Back came Cardiff once more and once again it was Morrison leaping above the Bournemouth defence to sneak a header in at the back post, again from a Whittingham cross.

The home side came again and Ritchie had a goal ruled out for offside after Arter's shot had been pushed out to him by Marshall.

Still Cardiff wouldn't give up and substitute Tom Adeyemi attempted an audacious flick that went over Boruc's goal.

Then, with two minutes left, the knockout blow. Ritchie slipped the ball through to Wilson and the in-form striker kept running past defenders and then the goalkeeper until nobody stood in his way, rolling the ball into an unguarded net.

'We're top of the league,' sang the jubilant home crowd. Now for the week's main attraction.
