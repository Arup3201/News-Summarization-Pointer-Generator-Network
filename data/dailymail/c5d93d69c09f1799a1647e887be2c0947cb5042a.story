Ever had one of those days when you feel like you're taking one step forward and two steps back?

This man, filmed outside a pub in Hackney, east London, clearly is familiar with the expression, as this bizarre video clip shows.

The man, who appears to have been drinking, is seen attempting to walk forwards, only to find himself drifting backwards every time.

A man, who appears to have been drinking, was filmed outside a Hackney pub literally taking one step forward, pictured left, before taking two steps back, pictured right - several times

During the footage, the man is then seen attempting to walk forwards again towards the brick wall... 

... But he soon retreats two steps backwards, pictured left, and ends up propping himself up against a large gate, pictured right

Dressed in a t-shirt, flip flops and shorts, with a man bag slung over his shoulder, he can be seen taking a couple of steps, before retreating and propping himself up against a large gate. 

He is also seen shuffling forwards and backwards in a square shape and at one point leans right back, hovering just inches from the floor before he is able to right himself and return to an upright position.

Eventually, after around two minutes, the apparent struggle to get anywhere proves too much, and the man slumps to the ground next to the gate. 

The footage was shot by Barnaby Slater, 33, who had been out to celebrate a friend's birthday in July when he spotted the stranger across the road, and started filming him.

But he is soon able to pull himself up and returns to an upright position - at least for a few seconds

Eventually, after around two minutes, the apparent struggle to get anywhere proves too much - and the man slumps to the ground next to the gate

'The man just couldn’t walk forwards, every time he thought he walking properly he was actually stumbling backwards, that’s why I had to film it,' he told website Newsflare.com.

Mr Slater is thought to have shot the video in July, and posted it around a month later.
