We reviewed a giant head-encasing cushion in October, which had one observer genuinely wondering whether it was a dog's bodywarmer, and now, finally, the mini version has arrived.

The Ostrich Pillow's little sister, the Ostrich Pillow Light, is half the price and half the size providing a more portable device for a snooze on the move.

It promises to provide enough sensory deprivation for some shut-eye while being small enough to fit into a handbag like a scarf - and it won't scare any children.

The Ostrich Pillows get their name 
because once they're on, you are 'buried' away from the outside world like 
an ostrich burying its head in the sand.

They are handcrafted in Spain from ultra-soft jersey padded out with 'smart micro 
balls' which are similar to beanbag filling but much more fine. This 
means you can slump against the side of... well, just about anywhere, 
and not feel the vibrations from the train, bus or plane.

Despite
 its size, the original Ostrich Pillow is as light as helium and the micro balls are coated in a 
special silicone, meaning they don't make a beanbag-esque noise when you
 lean against them.

However, as well as the embarrassment factor, there 
are other downsides.

Unless you're on a plane, sofa, or in a well-ventilated 
area, it can get too warm. Wrapping a mini-beanbag around your face is not ideal in a 
packed, sweaty train carriage. It is also sure to ruin your hairdo.

The mini version is constructed of jersey and polystyrene balls like the original

Cue Ostrich Pillow Light.

Eager
 to respond to customer feedback, makers Studio Banana 
Things recently unveiled the mini version, which is constructed
 of the same jersey and polystyrene balls.

But this time, it only wraps around 
your eyes and ears in a Bruce Springsteen-style headband, leaving 
your neck and the top of your head exposed to the elements. 

You 
may look as if you're living in a virtual reality world while it's on 
your head, but the Ostrich Light can, at least, be pulled down and worn 
around the neck as a scarf when you're awake, and is much less bulky.

Napping - in style? The Ostrich Pillow looks like a giant balaclava crossed with an old-fashioned diving helmet

Available from Firebox, the Studio Banana 
Things travel cushions are the brainchilren of Key Portilla-Kawamura and 
Ali Ganjavian who set up their company after meeting at university in 
London in the 1990s.

Their aim was to create simple solutions to 
everyday needs. And where better to start than with the Western world's 
chronic lack of sleep?

'Power-napping
 improves productivity by 34 per cent,' explains Ali.

Our writer Nicole catches up on some shut-eye while on a bus

'We spend so much 
time at work, in front of a screen or in transit, we thought: "Why not 
create something that helps us disconnect and dream?"

'All you have to do is find a place to nap, slip on the Ostrich Pillow and away you go.'

Just one month after launching Ostrich Pillow Light, the company boasted 1,400 
orders worth almost Â£50,000, going to show they're obviously onto something.

After all, when you're that tired, and a pillow is this comfortable, who gives a damn what you look like?
