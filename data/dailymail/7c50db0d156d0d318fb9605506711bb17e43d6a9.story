The £4,500 cost of moving a palm tree 300 metres was described as farcical last night.

Torbay Council, which faces budget cuts of £3.8million, was already under fire for stumping up £7,000 to import the 20ft Canary date palm from Spain to erect on a roundabout billed as the gateway to Torquay in Devon.

But now the tree has been moved to a new site just up the road at the entrance to a shopping centre to make way for a dual carriageway.

Council officials were forced to spend £4,500 moving the £7,000 tree, pictured, just 300 metres up the road

Torquay mayor Gordon Oliver said the palm tree would make an 'impact' to visitors to the Devon town, pictured

The GMB union’s local branch secretary, Paul Raybould, who discovered the cost of the move, said: ‘This looks farcical. Council staff facing redundancies would be astonished and aghast at such a waste of public money.’

The tree was the brainchild of Torbay Council’s mayor, Gordon Oliver, who said ‘we wanted to make a real impact so we decided to “go large”’ with the palm. 

During last winter the tree had to be wrapped in a hessian sack, to stop it being damaged by frost, which critics claimed made it look like a giant phallus.

The tree was the idea of Torbay Council’s mayor, Gordon Oliver.

He said: 'We wanted to make a real impact so we decided to ‘go large’ by bringing in the six-metre high palm.

'It will leave our many thousands of visitors with an abiding memory when they set off for home.'
