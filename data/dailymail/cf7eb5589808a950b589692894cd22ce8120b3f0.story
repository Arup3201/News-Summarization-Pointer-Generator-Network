Killed: Dennis J. Pegg was considered a mentor to the Boy Scouts he trained, but now it is thought that Pegg sexually abused his murdered at a young age

A former scoutmaster who had deep local ties to his New Jersey community was brutally murdered over the summer and was found with his throat slit and multiple stab wounds over his body.

Dennis J. Pegg was considered a mentor to the Boy Scouts he trained, but months after his grisly murder, darker questions have arisen.

Clark Fredericks, the 46-year-old man who confessed to Pegg’s murder, said that the scoutmaster sexually abused him as a boy, and said that he ‘got what was coming to him.’

Now, months after Pegg’s gruesome murder, others have echoed Fredricks’ complaint of sexual abuse.

Pegg was a lifelong resident of Stillwater, New Jersey, and had been active not only in the Boy Scouts, but many police honor legions, the NRA, and historical societies. He had also served in the military during the Vietnam Era.

But while his obituary painted the 68-year-old as an upstanding citizen, Fredericks’ affidavit showed Pegg in a drastically different light.

Fredericks said in his affidavit that Peggs ‘got what was coming to him’ because he had been ‘a child molester for years,’ and had exploited his time as a scoutmaster in the 1970s to get closer to young boys.

The court records, obtained by the New Jersey Star-Ledger, allege that Fredericks went to Pegg’s home in Stillwater on the night of June 12, joined by his friend, Robert Reynolds.

The two men were carrying knives in their vehicle. According to the affidavit, the two began stabbing Pegg as soon as they arrived at his quiet rental home.

Chilling photographs from Pegg’s entryway show large blood spatters where he was allegedly knifed.

Pegg was later found on his living room floor with more than 20 stab wounds to his torso. His throat was also slit.

Fredericks then drove to his mother’s house in Stillwater and removed his bloodied clothes, hiding the murder weapons in the process, the affidavit stated.

His mother, Joan Fredericks, tried in vain to get her son to seek medical attention for wounds he had apparently received from the assault, but Fredericks merely took some sleep medication and went to bed, the document said.

He was charged with first-degree murder. Reynolds, 47, was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and being an accomplice.

Both men have pleaded not guilty to the alleged crimes.

According to the Los Angeles Times, a source told police that they had seen a box containing pictures of child pornography at Pegg’s house in the 1970s.

Authorities retrieved a box of pictures of young boys from Pegg’s house, though none were considered to be pornographic.  Pegg was never married and had no children.

‘The witness described seeing this box
roughly 35 years ago, so it’s not overly surprising we were unable to 
find it,’ Sussex County Assistant Prosecutor Gregory Mueller told the 
paper.

There were no files of abuse on Pegg, a Boy Scout spokesperson said.

Pegg’s
estate is being overseen by his friend and attorney Ernest Hemschott 
III, who told the Times: ‘I’d have put my life in his hands. I trusted 
him that much.’

Mr Hemschott continued: ‘If it did happen, my heart goes out to the victims. But I just find it hard to believe.’

The
prosecuting attorney over the case speculated in June that the alleged 
attack was carried out only a day after former Penn State assistant 
football coach Jerry Sandusky went on trial.

News
of Pegg’s murder and of Fredericks’ abuse allegations come as the Boy 
Scouts face close scrutiny for their handling of past molestation 
claims.

The files, kept at 
Boy Scout headquarters in Texas, consist of memos from local and 
national Scout executives, handwritten letters from victims and their 
parents and newspaper clippings about legal cases.

The documents contain details about proven molesters, but also unsubstantiated allegations.

The allegations stretch across the country and to military bases overseas, from a small town in the Adirondacks to downtown Los Angeles.

In some cases, local law enforcement did nothing - despite a confession - seeking to protect the name of Scouting over their victims.

Boxed files containing witness accounts, complaints, and unresolved allegations of sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts were released in October. They contain cases collected between 1959 and 1985, with a handful of others from later years.

The files also document other troubling patterns. There is little mention in the files of concern for the welfare of Scouts who were abused by their leaders, or what was done for the victims.

But there are numerous documents showing compassion for alleged abusers, who were often times sent to psychiatrists or pastors to get help.

In numerous instances, alleged abusers are kicked out of Scouting but show up in jobs where they are once again in authority positions dealing with youths.

The files also show Scouting volunteers serving in the military overseas, molesting American children living abroad and sometimes continuing to molest after returning to the states.

But one of the most startling revelations to come from the files is the frequency with which attempts to protect Scouts from molesters collapsed at the local level, at times in collusion with community leaders.
