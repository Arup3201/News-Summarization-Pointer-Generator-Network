Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined £62million for breaching US sanctions against Iran and other brutal regimes, in another day of shame for British banks.

The State-backed lender reached the settlement with US authorities after it emerged that it has been concealing transactions with clients in Iran, Burma, Libya and Sudan for more than a decade.

Employees in the UK were given a step-by-step guide on how to conceal the identity of these sanctioned countries, stripping details from transactions with clients.

Fined: RBS breached sanctions on dealing with Iran and had been hiding deals with clients in Burma, Libya and Sudan since as early as 2002

The cover up occurred from at least 2002 to 2011, with more than 3,500 US dollar transactions worth £320 million routed through US banks.

The fine is split between the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve and New York state’s Department of Financial Services.

Anger: New York governor Andrew Cuomo will continue the battle against the banks

Four senior RBS employees, including its head of anti-money laundering were fired after RBS launched its own internal investigation in 2010.

Regulators said they were fully aware of the deceit and in some cases gave instructions to their employees.

Last night the bank said it ‘deeply regrets these failings’, which US regulators said ‘threatened the safety and soundness of RBS and violated New York law.’

Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York said: 'We have a vital responsibility to combat misconduct at banks and continue strengthening the long-term integrity of the financial system.

'In New York, we will continue our aggressive work rooting out global money laundering that puts our national security at risk.’

RBS is just the latest British bank to be fined for breaching US sanctions against rogue nations.

HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered have all reached settlements with US authorities, with Standard Chartered fined £415 million last year.

It was accused of dealing with clients including Iranian state backed lenders suspected of financing terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, as well as Iran’s nuclear weapons programme.
