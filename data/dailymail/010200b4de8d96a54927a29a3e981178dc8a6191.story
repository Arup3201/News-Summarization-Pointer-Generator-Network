Jake Beattie, eight, died after being hit by a 4WD on Monday at The Ponds in Sydney's north west

An eight-year-old boy, who was riding his bike to the park alongside his best friend, has died after being hit by a four-wheel drive. 

Jake Beattie was wearing a helmet and riding on the road at The Ponds in Sydney's north west on Monday afternoon when he rode through a give-way sign, according to Nine News. 

Levi Masi watched on helplessly as the car struck down his best friend at 5:45pm.

Paramedics were immediately called to the scene where they desperately worked on Jake through the pouring rain. 

Neighbours who were arriving home from work at the time told Fairfax Media that the driver of the four-wheel drive, a 32-year-old woman, was seen crying and distraught.

Kate Kljaic, a mother who lives in the area, described the tragic scene to Nine News. 

'You knew it wasn't going to be good just by how everyone was standing around,' Ms Kljaic said. 

'[Jake's] mother was just naturally beside herself and just didn't know what was happening.

'She came rushing down and everyone was just doing their best to try and help him. It was just very difficult to watch.

Jake was rushed to Westmead Hospital but died from his severe injuries.

His local football coach, Gavin Mackay, said he was 'devastated' to hear about the young boy's death and described him as 'an energetic, happy, very polite' boy who loved playing with his mates.

Neighbours and friends have formed a small tribute on the corner of Paddock Street and Capertree Street where the eight-year-old was hit, placing down flowers, stuffed toys and notes in his memory.

'May the angels guide you up to a wonderful resting place. You have our community mourning for you little fella. Our prayers go out to your family and friends,' one of the notes read, according to Fairfax.

Less than half an hour after Jake's accident, a Sydney teenager was also seriously injured after being hit by a vehicle.

Justin Shanahan, from McGraths Hill in Sydney's north west, was 'standing in the break-down lane of Pitt Town Road, McGraths Hill when he was struck by a b-double truck', police said. 

The 14-year-old has undergone surgery after suffering wounds to his arm and forehead and is currently recovering in Nepean District Hospital.

His family are appealing for the driver of the truck, who failed to stop after hitting the teen, to come forward.

'Cowardly, just come forward. It's not right,' Justin told Nine News on Tuesday.
