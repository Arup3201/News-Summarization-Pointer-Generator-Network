Lawyers for two terror suspects currently being held by the U.S. in Guantanamo Bay have accused Poland of human rights abuses.

They say they fell victim to the 
CIA's program to kidnap terror suspects and transfer them to other countries as they allege that they were tortured in a remote Polish prison. 

The case marks the first time 
Europe's role in the CIA's 'extraordinary rendition' of terror suspects 
has reached European Court of Human Rights.

Lawyers for two terror suspects currently being held by the U.S. in Guantanamo Bay accuse Poland of human rights abuses

One of the cases concerns 48-year-old
 Saudi national Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who currently faces terror 
charges in the U.S. for allegedly orchestrating the al-Qaeda attack on 
the USS Cole in 2000, a bombing in the Yemeni port of Aden that killed 
17 sailors and wounded 37. 

The second case involves 42-year-old 
Abu Zubaydah, a Palestinian also held in Guantanamo.

Zubaydah has never 
been charged with a crime.

A declassified report released in 
2009 showed the CIA deemed al-Nashiri and Zubaydah as 'high value 
detainees' meaning they are held under ultra-secure conditions in a 
secret section of Guantanamo known as Camp 7. 

Human rights groups believe about eight terror suspects were held in Poland, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks

Both men say they were brought to 
Poland in December 2002, where they were detained and subjected to harsh
 questioning in a Polish military installation in Stare Kiejkuty, a 
village set in a lush area of woods and lakes in the country's remote 
northeast.

There they were subject to mock 
executions, waterboarding and other tortures, including being told their
 families would be arrested and sexually abused, said Amrit Singh, a 
lawyer representing al-Nashiri. 

'This case is an opportunity to break
 the conspiracy of silence about the participation of some European 
governments in the CIA's rendition program, Singh said. 'These acts 
occurred on Polish territory with the acquiescence and connivance of the
 Polish authorities,' Singh said. 

Polish prosecutor Janusz Sliwa said 
that Poland should be allowed to complete its own investigation into the
 claims before having them taken up by Europe's human rights court.

Sliwa is leading the Polish investigation, which has gone on for five years without an outcome. 

They are asking the court to condemn Poland for various abuses of rights guaranteed by Europe's Convention on Human Rights. 

Former CIA officials have said that a prison in Poland operated from December 2002 until the fall of 2003.

Human rights groups believe about 
eight terror suspects were held in Poland, including Khalid Sheikh 
Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the September 11, 2001, 
attacks. 

Polish leaders in office at the time -
 former President Aleksander Kwasniewski and former Prime Minister 
Leszek Miller - denied the prison's existence.

Detained: The men are currently being held in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba

In his memoir Decision Points 
former President George W. Bush writes that he ordered the CIA to 
subject about 100 terror detainees to harsh interrogation techniques, 
arguing the methods did not constitute unlawful torture and that they 
produced intelligence that prevented further attacks. 

The CIA has never said where the 
black sites were based, but intelligence officials, aviation reports and
 human rights groups say they included Afghanistan and Thailand as well 
as Poland, Lithuania and Romania. 

Polish prosecutors opened an 
investigation into the matter in 2008.  It has been extended several 
times and remains pending, although authorities have never disclosed the
 investigation's terms or scope. 

Sliwa said that Polish investigators 
have not had access to the two men. He acknowledged that their 
investigation has been long, 'but not excessively lengthy.' All the prisons were closed by May 
2006.

Interrogations at sea have replaced CIA black sites as the U.S. 
government's preferred method for holding suspected terrorists and 
questioning them without access to lawyers. 

The court's ruling is expected at a 
later date. Singh said she is hopeful that a ruling in her client's 
favor will come before September 2, 2014 - the date his U.S. trial is 
scheduled to begin.
