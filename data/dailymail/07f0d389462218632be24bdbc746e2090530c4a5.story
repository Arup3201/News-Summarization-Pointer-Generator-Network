England all-rounder Tim Bresnan has agreed a deal with Hobart Hurricanes ahead of the forthcoming Big Bash.

Twenty-nine-year-old Bresnan will land in Australia later this month, his county Yorkshire announced on Wednesday.

Bresnan will replace Darren Sammy for Hobart in the T20 competition, with the West Indian leaving halfway through to link-up with his country at a training camp.

'The KFC T20 Big Bash League is a great competition,' Bresnan said on Yorkshire's official website.

'I have been lucky enough to watch it over the last three of four years and I think it is great, they put on a proper show and I can't wait to get a taste of it.'

Bresnan will compete alongside former England team-mates Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen in the competition.
