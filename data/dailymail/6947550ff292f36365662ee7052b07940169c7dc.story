We've all been there: the drunken stumble home that takes a little longer than it should.

But few take it quite as far as this poor man in China.

After a night of heavy drinking in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province, he fell into a gap between the two walls of a building on as he made his way home on Wednesday night.

Unable to free himself, he spent an uncomfortable night trapped in the tight spot.

Quite why he was walking home along the rooftops is another question 
entirely, and one he didn't answer when explaining himself to the 
emergency services who came to his rescue the following day.

He simply said: 'I cried for a long time but no one heard me. Then I fell asleep.'

When he woke he began cry out for help and was heard by a passer-by who called the emergency services.

Stunned firefighters used a thick rope with which to pull the heavy-eyed and embarrassed-looking man free.

Freed by the rope, the man looks in surprisingly good spirits as he is stands for the first time in 12 hours

And he's horizontal again! Firemen take no chances with his health andÂ  carry him off for health checks
