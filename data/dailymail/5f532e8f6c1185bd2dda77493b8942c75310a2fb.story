Our ‘Hands Off In The Box’ campaign has won a major victory, with Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore confirming the issue of penalty-area grappling and shirt pulling will be addressed next month, at a meeting of players, referees and managers.

With the issue of manhandling players in the box reaching a nadir in Manchester United’s clash with Chelsea, when Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling held John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic with impunity, Sportsmail led the way for referees to punish players more consistently.

Acknowledging our campaign was one of the ways in which football authorities were held to account, Scudamore said: ‘Clearly there have been a number of incidents highlighted in the past few weeks regarding this and, under close scrutiny by television and everything else, some of them don’t look great. 

'We have had a meeting with the team captains and what the players are saying is that they don’t necessarily think there needs to be any crackdown or clampdown but what they really want is some clarification.

'There will be a meeting of the Premier League, the FA, the Football League, the referees’ body, the PGMO, the League Managers’ Association and players. The Mail’s campaign is one of the ways things are held to account. 

'A couple of seasons ago there was a spate of what people called two-footed tackles and people didn’t quite know what the law was.

‘What happened then was that everyone got together and came up with a clarification which went round to all the players and teams. It wasn’t a change of law and it wasn’t a change of emphasis.

‘Because there had been some inconsistency, people were saying we don’t know what the rules are any more. That is about to happen on this topic.’
