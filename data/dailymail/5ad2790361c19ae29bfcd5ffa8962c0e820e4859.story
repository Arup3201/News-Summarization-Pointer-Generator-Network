A newly-renovated mansion in London's most expensive street could be worth an incredible £200million, estate agents say.

The 13-bedroom grade II*-listed house in Kensington Palace Gardens, west London, has been improved to a 'mind-boggling' standard by Britain’s second-richest man, Russian-born tycoon Leonard Blavatnik.

The Warner Music Group owner has a 25-metre swimming pool, divided between indoor and outdoor sections, which property experts said is probably unique in central London.

The basement has a hot tub, gym, massage
 room, cinema and wine cellar. The property is protected by armoured glass and it has a 'multi-storey' underground car park 
served by a car lift with room for five vehicles.

According to property experts, the 
modernisation means it could be worth as much as £7,000 per sq ft if it 
were to come on the market.

That would eclipse the Candy Brothers' stunning £6,000 per sq ft apartment block One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge.

However, last week it was revealed an end of terrace home in London is 
set to become the most expensive property ever sold in the UK after it 
went on the market for £250million.

The
 six-storey Grade I listed Regency mansion is a stone's throw from 
Buckingham Palace and boasts 50,000 sq ft of living space, making it one
 of the capital’s largest private homes.

Last autumn, a huge house at Rutland Gate overlooking Hyde Park was put on sale for £300million, although its price was slashed when it failed to find a buyer.

Around the same time, 1 Cornwall Terrace, opposite Regent's Park, was advertised for £100million, which estate agents said was the highest price ever asked for a terraced house.

Kensington Palace Gardens is one of Britain's most exclusive addresses, dubbed 'billionaire's row'

Mr Blavatnik is close to completing his two-year project on the 27,000 sq ft Kensington Italianate villa just a stone's throw from the Embassy of the Russian Federation Residence.

Giles
 Hannah, managing director of Mayfair based VanHan, told the Evening 
Standard: 'It is one of the best on the street, with a particularly 
large garden and fantastic views overlooking the lawns of Kensington 
Palace, where the Duchess of Cambridge will be pushing her pram.

'He’s doing it to a phenomenal standard. It has vast ceiling heights. All the windows have armoured glass.'

'multi-storey' underground car park is served by a car lift with room 
for five vehicles.

Mr Blavatniks’ wealth has been estimated at  £11billion in the Sunday Times Rich List.

He paid £41million for 15 and 15b Kensington Palace Gardens in 2004, reportedly outbidding Roman Abramovich and Lakshmi Mittal.

Born Leonid Valentinovich Blavatnik in 1957 in the Soviet Union, he 
arrived penniless in the U.S. with his parents at the age of 21 but 
immediately took to American entrepreneurial capitalism.

After studying 
computer science at Columbia University in New York and attending 
Harvard Business School, he made an early fortune buying and selling 
apartments in Manhattan.

In May 2011 he bought Warner Music Group, in a $3.3billion all-cash buyout of the world’s third-largest music company, whose artists include Green Day, Metallica and Bruno Mars.

In February, he bought Parlophone Records, the once legendary record label, for £500 million.

Parlophone has the likes of Coldplay, Tinie Tempah and Blur on its roster and Blavatnik’s purchase makes him an even stronger power in the music game.

He has all of Parlophone and other EMI assets that were put up for sale by Universal after they’d taken over the company.

The house, which cost £10,000 to 
build in the mid 1850s, served as the Iraqi ambassador’s residence until
 1989, before becoming an annex of the Russian embassy that reputedly 
housed intelligence officers.

Mr Blavatnik, now a U.S. citizen, has rented 15a over the road while the work has been carried out by French-owned contractors Bouygues UK.

It is restoring the main house and turning the garages of the former stable block known as Cope House into a two bedroom 'security post' as, according to planning documents, '24 hour surveillance is needed.'

With completion still  several months away, the work has sent a buzz through the property sector. But  it is not yet clear whether Mr Blavatnik will try to find a buyer or simply keep the house as his London pad.

One 'fixer' specialising in the top end of the market said: 'The word is that if someone wanted to make an offer at an attractive level, then it would probably be considered seriously.

'I haven’t heard a particular number, but if you price it out per square foot £200 million is about where other super-premium pro-perty prices would suggest it’d be.'

Andrew Langton, chairman of Aylesford International who sold Mr Blavatnik the house, said the tycoon would be in no hurry to sell.

He said: 'He's banked $8billion this year, he doesn't need to sell anything.'
