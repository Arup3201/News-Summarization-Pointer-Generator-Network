A teenager who plotted to massacre his classmates in revenge for being bullied was thwarted by the FBI after agents received a tip off from a concerned internet chat-room user in America.

The 16-year-old, from Northamptonshire,  kept a stockpile of explosives, became ‘fascinated’ by mass killings and drew up a hit-list of his fellow students - including detailed blueprints of where they sat.

But when he bragged on web chat site Omegle that 'twenty minutes from now he would be armed with a Magnum .44 
revolver, a Beretta 92FS and various other weapons', one worried user across the Atlantic raised the alarm.

He was arrested after boasting anonymously to the American that he would keep shooting until his classmates were wiped out or the police arrived before killing himself, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

The American user alerted the FBI who immediately contacted UK police.

'I'll be ready in 20 minutes': He was arrested after boasting anonymously to a fellow user of chat room Omegle. The American user alerted the FBI who raised the alarm with UK police

Prosecutor
Mark Topping told the court: 'The boy told the person he was going to stage a massacre at his school using handguns then committing suicide.

'He said he would keep shooting until
the police arrived, at which point he would commit suicide. He also 
made a comment about how people shouldn't have bullied him so much.'

At
his house, police found explosive chemicals bought online with his 
father’s PayPal account, plans of his school, terrorist e-books and 
manuals on how to construct a bomb.

Following
his arrest last February, the teenager was transferred to a secure 
mental unit and has since been diagnosed with Asperger’s  syndrome, 
which Birmingham Youth Court heard ‘severely limits his ability to 
relate to others’.

When police searched his home in 
Northamptonshire they also found chemicals used to make explosives which
had been bought from the internet.

Raising concern: Birmingham Crown Court heard how the boy boasted on the chat room that in 'twenty minutes from now' he would be armed with a Magnum .44 revolver, a Beretta 92FS and various other weapons (picture posed by model)

'The boy also posted pictures of himself - some holding weapons which he uploaded to the website. In others pieces of paper were being held up with comments relating to a high school massacre.'

The boy pleaded guilty to one charge of possessing explosive materials and one charge of possessing terrorist materials.

'There were plans of class rooms, desks at which pupils sat and who was to be targeted. It
is interspersed with references to [the boy] feeling himself to be weak
and powerless, excluded from social activities and being bullied.'

Prosecutor Mark Topping

He also admitted a third charge of possessing 'Lollicon' images - Japanese cartoons depicting child sex abuse.

Mr Topping added that the boy had been arrested on February 26 before being transferred to a secure mental unit.

He said: 'He told both his carers and the police he had the desire to carry out a mass killing. Because
he suffers from severe Asperger's syndrome the assessment was that he 
may carry out such an attack if he was given the means to do so.

'His condition causes him to be less inhibited and severely limits his ability to relate to others.'

A police search of the boy's home 
found twenty publications, including 'The Terrorist Handbook', 'The CIA 
Explosives for Sabotage Manual' and bomb-making guide 'An Anarchist's 
Cookbook - Recipes for Disaster'.

The court heard that police also 
found diaries and hand-written notes containing detailed plans for the 
planned high-school massacre and research on 'Lone Wolf' killers 
including Black Panther Donald Nielsen.

A 16-year-old boy appeared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court and admitted possessing explosive chemicals and bomb-making books and diagrams

Mr Topping added: 'He spent some time
looking for this material and wrote out a quotation on a notice board 
at school which was quickly erased.

'The recoveries included diaries and notebook instructions for the construction of IEDs. There were further notes about plans for the massacre.

'There were plans of class rooms, desks at which pupils sat and who was to be targeted. It
is interspersed with references to [the boy] feeling himself to be weak
and powerless, excluded from social activities and being bullied.'

Officers also found sealed containers
of potassium nitrate and sulphur powder - 'precursor chemicals' for 
gunpowder - which the boy had bought online using his father's PayPal 
account.

Giving evidence, the boy's 
psychiatrist said he believed the massacre plans had been a 'fantasy', 
and that his disorder caused him to obsess over his interests.

Consultant Dr John O'Brien said the boy had developed a fascination with school shootings and serial killers.

He said: 'He has said in hospital 
that although he knew it was a crime and was wrong and would result in 
his arrest, it was part of a fantasy to deal with his interest in serial
killers and school shootings and he didn't intend to carry it out.

'He has talked about this in a 
fantasy-type way, and has said he never planned for it to be real life 
and he didn't have plans to carry it out.'

Imposing a hospital order, District 
Judge Howard Riddle said he had been persuaded by expert evidence that 
imposing a hospital order was the best course of action.

He said: 'I have been helped, as have
you, by very real expert assistance both from the lawyers and of course
from your doctors. It gives us all some cause for hope in this case.'
