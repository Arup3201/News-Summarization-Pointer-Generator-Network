Sarah Ferguson was spotted enjoying an evening out at celebrity hotspot Chiltern Firehouse with a glamorous group of friends last night.

The Duchess of York, 54, paired her trusty pastel pink blazer with matching nude slipper shoes with pink piping for the girls' night out.

She wore a short black dress featuring a flared drop hem with mesh strips, and carried a navy tote.

Her auburn hair was down and loose in a relaxed wavy style and she wore soft makeup and understated jewellery.

Her glamorous friends, meanwhile, both opted for tight, short dresses with lace detailing.

The leggy pair shunned flats in favour of stiletto heel shoes for their night out at the infamous ex-firehouse turned celebrity magnet.

A taxi dropped the trio off yesterday evening and a chauffeured car picked them up at around midnight.

'Firehouse',
 as it is called (or hashtagged) by those who dine there, is the latest offering from hip hotelier André 
Balazs.

Tony Blair, Orlando Bloom, Lily Allen and Kate Moss have all been spotted there - as well as Fergie's own daughter Beatrice.

The Firehouse is part of Balazs' collection of luxury hotels which 
include The Mercer in Soho, New York, Chateau Marmont in Hollywood and 
Sunset Beach in Shelter Island plus The Hamptons.

Starters include sea trout crudo, yellow mole, coriander (£11) and steak tartare, pine nuts, chipotle and Firehouse hot sauce (£12), while main courses include blackened salmon, sea kale, crispy skin and trout roe (£24) and pan-roasted chicken, charred leek heart, mustard tops (£26).

The Duchess of York's girly night out follows a trip to New York earlier this week to visit her youngest daughter Princess Eugenie, who has just been made permanent in her new job in the Big Apple.

Her proud mother took the first opportunity to fly out and congratulate her, as the pair were spotted hand in hand on a day out in Soho on Wednesday. The Duchess paused and hugged Eugenie in a heartfelt moment on the sidewalk.

Sarah and Eugenie took a stroll and went for lunch at a French restaurant. The pair strolled along in short black summery dresses and had bare legs.

Sarah's outfit featured white and pink accents and she comfy chose ballet pumps, while Eugenie opted for blue and tan accessories and wore block-heel sandals.

Eugenie, 
who was expected to return to Britain, has done such an impressive job 
during a trial with online auction house Paddle8 that she will be kept 
on for good, and her mother clearly couldn't be more delighted for her.

She
 has spent the past 12 months in America, and will now extend her stay, 
with Paddle8 founder Alexander Gilkes describing her as a 'great asset 
to the team'.
