Manchester City emphatically overcame their  curse at Sunderland with a 4-1 victory. An early goal from Connor Wickham gave  Gus Poyet's side the lead but Sergio Aguero equalised immediately before Stevan Jovetic put City ahead.

Defender Pablo Zabaleta got the third before Aguero found the net for his second. Here's how the players rated at the Stadium of Light:

Sunderland (4-1-4-1)

Costel Pantilimon 5.5

Beaten four times but hard to blame him for what were a collection of brilliant finishes.

Santiago Vergini 5.5

For a full back, he’s actually quite enjoyable to watch and thinks nothing of dropping a shoulder and out-witting a winger at his own game. Defensively he remains suspect and was caught cold for Aguero’s second.

John O’Shea 6

Aguero targeted Coates and that pays a compliment to O’Shea, who has been outstanding of late. He tried his best to organise against City’s star-studded offence but that was a tough ask.

Sebastian Coates 5

League debut for Black Cats and the last player he wanted to be facing was Aguero. He was skinned for the striker’s equaliser and his rustiness showed against top-quality opponents.

Anthony Reveillere 5

Has been in brilliant form since his free-transfer arrival last month but he found it tougher against Navas and struggled badly at times.

Lee Cattermole 6

Not as devastatingly disruptive as he was against Chelsea – although that would have been a tall order to repeat – but still got through his usual work with minimum fuss.

Will Buckley 5.5

He huffs and puffs but doesn’t really blow any defences down. Puts a shift in nonetheless. More quality needed though.

Jack Rodwell 5.5

A little subdued and did not stamp his mark like sidekick Larsson. Still struggling to make an impact since his £10m move from City in the summer.

Seb Larsson 7

Enjoyed exploiting gaps in behind City’s backline with cute passes early on and was at the heart of everything the hosts did offensively.

Connor Wickham 6.5

A touch of good fortune with opening goal but he deserved that for the endeavour which took him into the box.

Steven Fletcher 6

Tough task as lone man but he does it well and kept City’s central defenders occupied in first half.

Subs

Jozy Altidore 5.5 (on 55), Ricky Alvarez 6 (on 67)

Not used: Bridcutt, Brown, Cabral, Gomez, Mannone 

Manchester City (4-2-3-1)

Joe Hart 6

Very little to do and had little chance with goal. A routine evening.

Pablo Zabaleta 7

Recovered from his part in Sunderland’s opener to put in typically robust display and his goal, dinking over Pantilimon, was a touch of class.

Dedryck Boyata 6.5

Shaky start but found his rhythm and could now win a little run in the side.

Martin Demichelis 6.5

The partnership with Boyata took a little while to gel and, early on, looked like it might cost City dear as the hosts repeatedly slipped balls in behind their pair. But he steadied and cruised through the last hour.

Gael Clichy 6.5

Kept Buckley quiet and joined the attack as often as possible. Was unlucky not to see one of his crosses converted.

Yaya Toure 6.5

Again he never emerged from second gear and strolled through the contest. Still, he hardly put a foot wrong.

Fernandinho 7

A lot more energetic than Toure and saw a lot of the ball. Did well.

Aguero gave the Sunderland defence a torrid evening and scored two goals for his team

Jesus Navas 7.5

Caused his full back all manner of problems and fizzed a string of balls through the box without any takers.

Samir Nasri 7

A killer through-ball for Zabaleta’s goal and enjoyed more space as game wore on. Some delightful touches in and around the area.

Stevan Jovetic 6.5

An uncompromising finish to put City in front but wasn’t involved a great deal and eventually made way.

Sergio Aguero 9

Outstanding. Scored two – taking his tally for the season to 19 - and created one, winning applause from the home fans when he was replaced late on. He really is the best striker in world football right now.

Subs

James Milner 6.5 (on 55), Frank Lampard 6 (on 74), Jose Pozo (on 84) 

Not used: Sagna, Fernando, Caballero, Esmoris Tasende
