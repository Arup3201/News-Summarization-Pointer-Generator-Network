One of the main architects of the 
poll tax has warned ministers they are in line for similar chaos over 
controversial plans to impose council tax on thousands for the first 
time.

Tory peer Lord 
Jenkin, who helped design Margaret Thatcher’s doomed community charge, 
said plans to cut council tax benefit would hit the pockets of the 
working poor – just the sort of people for whom the Coalition has 
pledged to make work pay.

Experts
said last night that cuts to the benefit meant that up to 750,000 
people – most of them working people on low wages – could be forced to 
pay council tax for the first time, or will have to pay more.

The introduction of the Poll Tax in 1990 sparked riots, including violence in Brixton. Lord Jenkin said the government should brace itself for a 'backlash' to new changes to council tax

In addition, thousands of middle 
class people could lose out because some local authorities are scrapping
discounts on second homes in response to the reforms, which come into 
effect next April.

Lord
Jenkin told the BBC that the government needed to be braced for a 
‘backlash’ over the complicated changes to council tax benefit, which is
paid to 5.9million people.

The
warning comes just a day after accountants said another set of changes –
this time to child benefit – could also lead to chaos because the 
reforms are too complex for parents to understand.

The latest potential chaos arises 
from a double whammy in the way the reforms are being introduced. First,
ministers have slashed the fund for council tax benefit by 10 per cent,
around £500million.

Second,
they have scrapped the running of the benefit as a national scheme – 
meaning each council in England will decide who gets the handout for the
first time.

Councils
will therefore have to decide whether to cut the amount of benefit 
paid, to cut services, or try to fill the funding gap by scrapping 50 
per cent discounts for second homes and empty properties.

Authorities are not being allowed to reduce benefit for pensioners or to change the 25 per cent discount for single households.

Some
town halls have even gone as far as charging double the standard rate 
of council tax on empty and second homes – meaning that both the working
poor and the middle classes are being affected.

Lord Jenkin was Environment Secretary under Margaret Thatcher and was responsible for the poll tax

Lord Jenkin told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One that the Tories were making the same mistakes over council tax benefit as they made over the ill-fated poll tax, which sparked riots in London and was a factor in the downfall of Mrs Thatcher.

‘The poll tax was introduced with the proposition that everyone should pay something, and with the present structure of society it doesn’t work,’ he said. ‘We got it wrong.

‘The same factor will apply here, that there will be large numbers of fairly poor households who have hitherto been protected from council tax, who are going to be asked to pay small sums.’

He said many of those being hit would be ‘pretty vulnerable households’, adding: ‘I think the Treasury has taken a fairly brusque view of this all the way along.’

Tony Travers, a local government expert at the London School of Economics, said figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies implied that around 750,000 would be affected by council tax benefit cuts.

He said: ‘This could be a slow-burn political issue. Like Gordon Brown’s 10p tax rate, the impact will not be felt until people receive their bills in April and feel the pain. [must keep some of this].

‘It affects the same group of people, those who are working but do not earn much – the group that all politicians want to get into work and stay there.

‘One of the knock-out consequences is that councils are having to come up with other savings, and those with second homes are a target. There will be a large number of losers. Ministers should fiddle with council tax at their peril.’

Hilary Benn, Labour's communities spokesman, said: ‘When the architect of Thatcher’s poll tax – which contributed to her downfall – tells David Cameron that he's making the same mistake, it’s time for the Government to sit up and listen.’

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘Spending on council tax benefit doubled under the last administration and welfare reform is vital to tackle the budget deficit we have inherited.'
