Caroline Reed Robertson, just 19 years old, looked calmly at the police officer who had just asked where the neighbour she had idolised for years was, and answered matter of factly that she was dead.

'Are you sure,' the policeman asked?

'Yes, I've buried her,' Roberson replied.

The chilling confession in one of Australia's darkest murders is contained in a police interview with Robertson, who obsessively stalked 15-year-old Rachel Barber for four years before killing her in a bizarre attempt to steal her life.

Robertson had previously told Superintendent Neil Paterson that her former neighbour Rachel Barber, was dead and had been buried as police searched for the missing 15-year-old in 1999 

Victoria Police Superintendent Neil Paterson recalled the moment he received a clear and unemotional confession from Robertson, who drugged Barber before strangling her with a phone cord in her home in the Melbourne suburb of Prahran in 1999.

'I asked her where Rachel was and she responded to me that Rachel was dead. And that surprised me. I said, "you sure she's dead?" And she said "yes, I've buried her",' Superintendent Paterson told Channel Nine's Inside Story.

'I said "listen are you sure that she's dead? Is there no way we can help her?" She told me that she'd buried Rachel on a family country property near where she'd buried other pets'.

The program will air tonight at 8.30 on Channel Nine. 

What emerged from the police investigation into Barber death was an incredible and tragic tale of obsession, resentment and murder.

From the age of 14, Robertson watched Barber and came to be jealous of what she saw as her neighbour's perfect life compared to hers. Barber was an avid dance student, outgoing, well-liked; Robertson was overweight, depressive and had few friends.

Robertson worked her way into Barber's life, using her own younger sister, who was school friends with one of Barber's, becoming a babysitter for Barber's parents.

She lured Barber to her apartment on February 28, 1999, with the promise of $100 to take part in a 'psychological study'. The 19-year-old drugged and strangled her victim, then stuffed her body in a closet.

Robertson went to work the next day, and when she returned she wrapped the body in a blanket and rented a truck to take it to the farm to bury it. She later applied for a loan, money police later alleged she intended to use to flee Victoria.

Barber's devastated parents refused to believe their daughter had run away and launched a public campaign to find her. Police eventually discovered the link between Robertson and Barber on the day the murdered girl disappeared.

When police went to Robertson's apartment, they found her semi-conscious on the floor after suffering an epileptic fit.

In 2000, Robertson was jailed for 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 and a half years after pleading guilty to murdering Barber, an aspiring dancer.

Pictured with her mother, the dance student was lured to her death by Robertson who was obsessed with her former neighbour and plotted to steal her identity 

She was released on parole from the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre in January this year.

Her victim's sister, Heather Barber, told Inside Story 'It would not surprise me in the least when she gets out, [if] she targets me or my sister.'

'I'm just like, you want to see what I look like? Go for it. I mean, I'm not scared of you, why should I have to stop my life and hide away because you're a crazy?' 

Exclusive footage of the  police interview, obtained by Inside Story, shows an unresponsive and evasive Robertson who refused to give any more information.

'Did you bury her at your father's property at Kilmore' a policeman can be heard asking Robertson, who responds: 'I don't want to answer any questions'.

'Caroline's very cold, very matter of fact, but just very cold. There's no emotion there whatsoever. Absolutely calculating,' Mr Paterson said.

'There is evidence of planning. Caroline clearly planned this out. This was a premeditated murder. It's not spur of the moment and it's certainly not passion,' Superintendent Paterson said

'Some people might change their behaviour, their appearance, their job, their lifestyle, so they can be like their role model. But to actually want to kill the role model and replace them, I mean that's going really a long way,'Forensic Psychiatrist Julian Parmegiani said

'There is evidence of planning. Caroline clearly planned this out. This was a premeditated murder. It's not spur of the moment and it's certainly not passion.

'It's unbelievable that she would not recall what had occurred or know that she involved in the murder of Rachel.' 

Forensic Psychiatrist Julian Parmegiani told Inside Story that cases like Robertson's, in which a teenager kills an idol in order to steal their identity, were completely 'unheard of'.

'Some people might change their behaviour, their appearance, their job, their lifestyle, so they can be like their role model. But to actually want to kill the role model and replace them, I mean that's going really a long way,' Dr Parmegiani said.

'This is clearly an extreme case. I mean you can see a bit of fantasising in most teenagers, but to see someone going out of their way to kill their victim, to replace them, that's really unique.'

'I think that Caroline was very unhappy with herself: she didn't like the way she looked. She did want to take on that persona of someone that was happy, that was beautiful, that was popular like Rachel was and try and live that life,' Mr Paterson said

Mr Paterson said there was no doubt in his mind about Robertson's motivation.

'I think that Caroline was very unhappy with herself: she didn't like the way she looked. She did want to take on that persona of someone that was happy, that was beautiful, that was popular like Rachel was and try and live that life,' he said.

'You and I can sit here and say well that's just not possible, but certainly that's what she wanted to do and that is absolutely my belief of why she took Rachel's life.' 

Following her release last month, the Barber family asked the public not to harass Robertson, but give her 'the opportunity to quietly readjust to life outside of prison'. 

The family hope that Robertson, who suffers from a personality disorder, will be properly rehabilitated and supervised during her parole so she is not a danger to society.

Robertson had a deep-rooted self loathing, as demonstrated in this self-portrait which was used as evidence in her trial. At age 14 she drew this exaggeratedly ugly image of herself surrounded by degrading words

In another image Robertson drew of herself, it is clear that she has very low self confidence and is obsessed with her appearance. It is believed that jealousy and obsession was the reasoning for the murder of Rachel

Robertson's diary entries were used by police as evidence in the trial. 'How to change in nine weeks' was written by Robertson on the front of her journal; the pages inside detail her sick plans.  

They reveal the disturbed woman's terrifying obsession with the beautiful dancer as she plotted to kill and 'disfigure' the teen.

The journal and emotional letters to her father also expose the intense self-loathing Robertson felt, which led her to became fixated with Rachel, a pretty, talented, well-liked dance student. 

Robertson had grown up disgusted by herself, frequently painting disgusting self-portraits and scribbling hateful words about herself.

'Loser, unwanted, dirty, obese, funny in the head,' she wrote around one drawing when she was 14 years old.

'I don't belong anywhere in this crazy world because I'm ugly, obese, pizza face, white worm, massive nose and just plain weird.' 

But later detectives found that the diary entries became more sinister as the then 19-year-old plotted to murder her former neighbour.
