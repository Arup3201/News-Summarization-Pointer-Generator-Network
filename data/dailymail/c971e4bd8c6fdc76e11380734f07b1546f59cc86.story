A man with taste for the unusual has become the newest internet hit in China due his bizarre outfits.

Guo Li, who is believed to be around 50-years-old, regularly roams his hometown in Zhengzhou, central China, wearing a brightly coloured bra over a jumper, a pair of tights and women's ankle boots.

In a series of pictures covered by the People's Daily, the man has attracted huge public attention ranging from his bizarre appearance to his story behind him.

Unusual: Guo Li fills his bras with two dried steamed buns. He told Chinese media that he used to use apples but people stole his apples all the time

'Bra Brother' is well-known in Zhengzhou in central China. He often goes to parks or does shopping in his signature outfit 

Mr Guo is billed by the Chinese as the 'Bra Brother' and is well-known in Zhengzhou for his bizarre appearance.

He told one reporter that he only covers the bra up if it is raining or if it's too cold and he needs to wear a coat.

It seems that nobody knows why he dresses up like this exactly, but previous posts suggested that he might have been traumatised by a marriage in his early years.

Mr Guo declined to go into details of his back story. But he told the reporter that after he was divorced, he has been detained based on allegations of a girlfriend.

He said he is a big fan of ballet and has always liked the idea of tights. After he was released he started wearing women's clothes.

Despite being detained several times by the local authorities due to his unusual appearance, Mr Guo said he won't give up his freedom of expression

'I wear what I like, it's my right!' Mr Guo said.

Despite being detained several times by the local authorities for his outfit - and on one occasion being dragged off to a mental institution – Mr Guo said he will never give up his right to freedom of expression.

Mr Guo's ensemble often also includes a flower in his hair, and a garishly coloured umbrella usually carried regardless of whether or not it is raining.

In his bedroom, Mr Guo keeps many classic Chinese literature, including a Chinese historiography

Perhaps in order to make a good imitation, Mr Guo used to stick apples inside the bra but he said people often stole these apples. That's why he has decided to replace apples with dried steamed buns.

'People laugh at me, and point, but it only makes me even more determined to dress like this.

'I just like to do what makes me happy and dressing like this is my main pleasure.'

'Bra Brother' also bring an umbrella every day to complete his look
