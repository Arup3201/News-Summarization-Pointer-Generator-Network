Thought you kissed goodbye to being marked on your every move the moment you left school or university? Think again.

New dating app The Grade has a school-style marking system that gives users letter-based grades depending how how well they present themselves, interact and spell, and on whether they send inappropriate messages.

The scariest part? If you fail to get a D average then you'll be kicked off the app, or as they like to put it, 'Make the grade or be expelled.' 

Going back to school! New dating app The Grade marks people from F to a A+, if you don't make the grade you're off the app

The app's grade scale ranges from an F to an A+ and the aim is to weed out users who are unpopular, unresponsive and inappropriate.

Sign up and you will be marked on three categories; popularity, responsiveness and message quality.

Popularity is assessed on how often the person is 'liked' by their fellow users and the quality of their profile, including pictures and a brief description.

Responsiveness checks how often a user is messaging people and how often they get a message back.

Lastly, message quality assesses the characteristics of the missives people send, from whether they make a lot of spelling mistakes to whether they use slang or inappropriate words.

Everyone who is on the app can see your grades with your individual rankings pulled together to make an overall average.

Dating apps are hugely popular with many of us finding love online through services like Tinder and Happn

Anyone getting C's will automatically be sent advice from The Grade telling them how to improve their performance in a bid to help them avoid from being expelled.  

The app works in a similar way to  Tinder by allowing users to pull information and pictures from their Facebook profile in order to create their account.

However, if you click on someone's picture and don't like the grade that you see then you can use the back option, effectively un-doing your 'like'. 

Clifford Lerner, CEO of Snap Interactive - the company who developed that app, explained: 'Although mobile dating apps have exploded in popularity, feedback has painted a picture of horrific user experiences.

'We believe mobile daters deserve a superior experience and decided to create The Grade to eliminate the inappropriate, hostile and undesirable singles that currently taint the mobile dating pool.'

Just like Tinder if you like someone The Grade will tell you it's a match (left). You will also be told their message quality grade so you have a good idea of what to expect (right)

The Grade first came into conception after a survey of 1,000 mobile dating app users found that a lot of people were unhappy with the services they were being offered and the other people using them.

The study found that 73 percent of women using dating apps had received an inappropriate photograph and 77 percent had been asked to send nude pictures themselves.

A huge 90 per cent had received sexually suggestive messages and - most importantly to the makers of The Grade - an almost conclusive 91 percent said that they wished that there was a dating service that would remove or filter out those types of users. 

An example of how Singled Out works. A woman posts a picture of herself and asks a question, men are then invited to answer her 

Recently a number of apps have been launched with a similar intentions to The Grade. 

Singled Out allows women to have all the control by posing one of 200 questions to their potential  suitors, they then have the option to speak with the men whose answers they like.

Mesh is another app that filters messages by picking up on those that swear or use other crude, sexual words. 

Then there is Siren, which keeps your picture private until you feel comfortable to release it to your match.

Looks like it won't be long until creepy online dating behaviour is a thing of the past!
