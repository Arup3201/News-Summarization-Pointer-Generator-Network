Former Liverpool ace Dominic Matteo believes it is make-or-break time for Brendan Rodgers' men as they embark on a hugely important week in their season.

After an indifferent start to the new campaign, the Reds face Newcastle in the early kick-off on Saturday, before a trip to Real Madrid on Tuesday night in the Champions League, and at the end of the week welcome leaders Chelsea to Anfield.

And Matteo has claimed this next week will define their whole season, as they look to push towards the upper regions of the Premier League and advance to the Champions League knock-out stages.

'This is a real tough week ahead for Liverpool. This is a real defining point of the season for them,' said Matteo on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast.

'You look at the next three games coming up, that is a real tough, tough week. I think after this week we will know which way Liverpool's season is going.' 

The Reds currently lie nine points behind Jose Mourinho's side in the Premier League, and are joint-second in Group B of their Champions League group.
