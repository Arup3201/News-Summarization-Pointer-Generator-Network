Pig farmers say they are being forced out of business leaving British bacon under threat, it has emerged.

One hundred pig producers say they could be forced to shut down their pig units by Christmas because they can't afford to feed their animals.

The problem is poor crop growing weather around the world which is pushing up the cost of pig feed.

Worry: Ten per cent of pig producers say they 
could be forced to shut down their pig units by Christmas because they 
can't afford to feed their animals

In a double whammy many small and medium sized producers are also being crippled as supermarkets continue to source cheaper pork from abroad.

The problems mean 1.5million rashers of bacon a week and 2.3million sausages a week could disappear from supermarket shelves.

Plus the cost British bacon, sausages and other pork products is expected to rise.

Last month bacon was voted Britain's favourite food according to the top 100 Foods Index.

Standards: Imported sausages and bacon are not 
produced to the same welfare standards as in Britain

British pig farmers, who are recognised as world leaders in high welfare pig farming, are now urging shoppers to 'Buy British' in a bid to rectify the situation.

Shoppers can look for the 'Red Tractor' logo found on British-produced products to make sure they are supporting the nation's farmers.

Although
imported sausages and bacon will still be available these are not 
produced to the same welfare standards as in Britain.

National Pig Association general manager Dr Zoe Davies said: 'If supermarkets see a surge in demand 
for British product, they may be persuaded to pay our farmers the few 
extra pennies a kilo more they need to cover their soaring feed bills.

'So we are asking shoppers, who have 
always been incredibly loyal in the past, to please be extra careful to 
look for the British Red Tractor logo on bacon, sausages, and pork.'

The cost of key ingredients used in pig 
feed, like wheat and soya, has increased by more than 25 per cent in the
past few weeks.

This is 
due to massive droughts in the United States, South America and the 
Black Sea Region which have severely affected crop yields.

Rivalry between supermarkets means they are reluctant to pay farmers more to cover their extra costs of production.

The problems follow protests by dairy farmers last month who were furious when middle-men tried to cut the price they pay for milk to 25p a litre.

Thousands blocked dairies and distribution centres in Somerset, Shropshire and Worcestershire to prevent deliveries to shops, claiming the price cut would put them out of business.

The row was triggered when dairy firms Arla Foods, Dairy Crest and Robert Wiseman threatened a cut of up to 2p in wholesale prices on August 1, following a 2p cut in April, to compensate for falls in the price of cream on global markets.

Farmers said the shortfall would force them out of business, as the selling price would be lower than the cost of producing a pint.
