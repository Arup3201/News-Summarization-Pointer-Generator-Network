Grilled by MPs: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said was open to moves to cool Britain's housing market if it began to over-heat

House prices should not be allowed to rise by more than 5 per cent a year – and the Bank of England should stop them if they do, a report will say today.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) will today call for radical new rules, such as banning banks from lending more than 80 per cent of a property’s value and shrinking the maximum life of a mortgage.

In an explosive move, it says urgent action is needed by the Bank due to ‘a growing risk of another house price boom’.

Yesterday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney also signalled to MPs that he was open to moves to cool Britain’s housing market if it began to over-heat.

The institution warned that if action was not taken to control house prices, ‘another housing bubble, reckless bank lending and a dangerous build-up in household debt’ could cripple Britain again.

But the move will draw protests from the generation of young people already frozen off the property ladder by house price rises. With an average home now costing £170,000, nearly seven times the average full-time salary, the introduction of a compulsory deposit amount – such as 20 per cent – could make it even harder for young people to get on the property ladder.

Critics warn the housing market is already over-heating, with price rises in each of the past seven months, largely fuelled by the Government’s interventions. Under two controversial schemes, both called Help to Buy, people are being encouraged to buy a home with a deposit of just 5 per cent. The second scheme launches in January.

In Canada – where Mr Carney ran the Bank of Canada before coming to the UK in July – 100 per cent mortgages are banned and a minimum deposit of 20 per cent is needed if you are refinancing a loan, and 5 per cent on a new mortgage.

Grilled by Labour MP Pat McFadden about what he would do about ‘an unhealthy acceleration in house prices’, Mr Carney told the Treasury Select Committee that a ‘more intensive supervision of lending’ was possible.

One option is ‘some guidance provided in terms of loan-to-value ratios’, he said. The loan-to-value ratio is the figure representing the size of deposit in relation to the property’s value. For example, a £10,000 deposit on a £100,000 home gives an ratio of 90 per cent.

But he added: ‘We do not have powers of direction in that regard, but certainly have an ability to observe and recommend if necessary.’

Still a dream: With an average home now costing £170,000, nearly seven times the average salary, the introduction of a compulsory deposit amount could make it even harder for youngster to get on the property ladder

Joshua Miller, senior economist at RICS and author of the report, said capping house price inflation at 5 per cent per year ‘would discourage households from taking on excessive debt out of fear of missing out on a price boom’.

At present, house prices are rising by 6.2 per cent a year, but rose  by up to 30 per cent a year at the height of the boom a decade ago.

RICS said the policy could be introduced on a regional basis, if some areas of the UK are hit by rampant house price inflation but homeowners in other regions experience the opposite.

But in a recent report, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said: ‘Intervention to dampen buoyancy in some locations would almost certainly bear down on other local markets where activity is more subdued, unless carefully targeted.’

The number of first-time buyers getting a mortgage has hit the highest level since the credit crunch began in 2007 as banks are offering far more loans which need only a 5 per cent deposit. Before the credit crunch, there were 1,000 different types of 95 per cent loans. During the recession, it dropped to just three, but has rallied to 46.

█ Mr Carney admitted to MPs that savers had been hammered by record low interest rates designed to encourage people to spend.

He said thrifty savers and pensioners who have seen their nest eggs eroded by years of dismal returns and high inflation deserve ‘tremendous sympathy’.

But he said holding the Bank rate at rock bottom ‘encourages spending rather than saving’ and that the rates – which have been held at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – must not rise any time soon for fear of snuffing out the recovery.

Simon Rose, from campaign group Save Our Savers, said Mr Carney’s comments amounted to: ‘Spend as much as you can, even if it means borrowing to do it and maybe it will ginger up the economy.’
