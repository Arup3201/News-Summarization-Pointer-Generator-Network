A 13-year-old boy whose friend was accidentally shot dead as they played with a gun covered the body with a blanket and fled his family home, police said yesterday.

The panic-stricken teen did not tell anyone what had happened and spent Wednesday night elsewhere, leaving his cousin to come home and find 14-year-old TyJuan Woodard lying dead on a futon.

But the man initially assumed the figure under the blanket was his sleeping cousin and did not disturb him, according to police in Little Rock, Arkansas.

It was not until a few hours later that the 13-year-old's relative took a closer look and realised he did not recognise the boy on the futon. He picked TyJuan up and noticed he was not breathing, having been shot in the chest.

Someone called the emergency services and when officers arrived, they found the boy lying face-up on the floor, according to the police report.

There was blood on his face and chest, and as medics lifted his shirt, they found what looked like a bullet wound.

Police said everyone in the home said they didn't know the boy or what had happened. TyJuan lives elsewhere and had previously run away from home, according to police spokesman Lt Terry Hastings.

Lt Hastings said officers talked to the other boy on Thursday morning.

A woman who said she was the 13-year-old's grandmother said he stayed with his aunt on Wednesday night.

'He said he was scared, but I wish he had told me, just told me something,' she said.

She had never seen TyJuan before he was found lying on the floor of her home.

'All I could see was blood on his nose,' she added.

The woman is not being named so as not to identify her young grandson.

Lt Hastings said he wasn't sure how the boys got a hold of the gun, which belongs to one of the 13-year-old's relatives. He said they were playing with the firearm in a bedroom when it went off and a bullet hit the 14-year-old in the chest.

No charges have been filed, but Lt Hastings said the case will be forwarded to the prosecutor. One of the prosecutors, John Johnson, said his office is yet to receive the case file.
