It’s the moment most men with a long-term girlfriend dread – the ‘quiet word’ with her mother about his future intentions.

And Carole Middleton certainly wasn’t prepared to avoid the subject just because the man dating her daughter Kate was a future King.

A new book by The Mail on Sunday’s Royal Editor Katie Nicholl reveals how ‘jittery’ Carole, worried about the absence of a ring on Kate’s finger, took Prince William aside to press him on his plans.

William assured Carole that not only would there be an engagement and subsequent marriage, the couple hoped to have children

The meeting took place when William visited the Middleton family just before Christmas 2009.

In
the book – Kate: The Future Queen – a family friend tells how  Carole 
expressed her fears to  William. But he assured her that not only would 
there be an engagement and subsequent marriage, the couple hoped to have
children – and he promised Carole that she would be fully involved in 
their upbringing.

William
stayed true to his word.  The couple were engaged the following 
November and since their son George was born on July 22, Carole has 
become the most famous grandmother in Britain.

She and her husband, Michael, were the 
first family members to visit the new baby after his birth – ahead of 
Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall – while Kate and William have
even set aside a ‘granny flat’ for the Middletons at their lavish 
Kensington Palace apartment.

Another
of the Middletons’ friends, former neighbour George Brown, says: ‘It 
was a condition when Kate and William got married that Carole and 
Michael would be a part of the grandchildren’s lives.’

Kate paid tribute to ‘Granny’ Carole last week during her first public appearance since the birth.

The new book also untangles the tale of how Kate came to choose St Andrews for her university

Carole looked after George when Kate 
and William attended the start of a marathon on Anglesey on Friday. 
Kate’s presence at the event was a surprise – it was only revealed that 
morning that she would attend.

It is thought it could be one
of the couple’s last engagements on Anglesey before they leave their 
home on the Welsh island next month to settle into a new life in London.

The new book also untangles the tale 
of how Kate came to choose St Andrews for her university – starting at 
the same time as William and on the same course

It
has previously been put down to mere coincidence, but it seems Kate 
deliberately plotted to be there at the same time as the prince.

Jasper
Selwyn, a careers adviser at Kate’s former school, Marlborough College,
and Joan Gall, her house tutor, confirm in the book that her first 
choice was not St Andrews at all, but Edinburgh.

Despite
achieving the required grades for Edinburgh, one of the country’s top 
universities, she changed her mind after William’s own choice of 
university was  made public.

In
a bold move, Kate turned down the place she had been offered at 
Edinburgh, decided to take a gap year, just as William was doing, and 
reapply for St Andrews – a risky strategy as there was no guarantee that
she would get a place. Since then, of course, their relationship has 
flourished.

In another 
fascinating insight into the Royal romance, the book reveals that 
although Kate has taken on a higher public profile since her marriage, 
she in fact began doing secret charity work six years ago.

In
2007 the Queen quietly suggested to William that Kate get involved with
a charity, and they both considered it an excellent idea.

The 
Middletons’ family firm, Party Pieces, already had a connection with 
Starlight, a children’s charity which grants terminally ill children a 
once-in-a-lifetime wish.

The Duchess of Cambridge said that Prince George has been very 'good'. The pair released this official photograph of their young family

Kate arranged to meet the charity’s chief executive officer Neil Swan to see how she could help more.

He
said: ‘Kate was working with Party Pieces at the time and she came up 
with a clever idea for a party bag that doubled up as a colouring-in 
gift.

‘She also designed some Starlight-themed crayons and other bits and pieces to go in the bags. To us, she was just Kate, and we would go and have meetings with her at Party Pieces, and sometimes she would come to us.

In 2007 the Queen quietly suggested to William that Kate get involved with a charity, and they both considered it an excellent idea

‘She came up with lots of creative ideas for parties that we were arranging for sick children, and she did a lot of work below the radar.’

It is also revealed that Kate made numerous secret visits to the Naomi House children’s hospice in Hampshire.

She would drive to the hospice bearing gifts for the children, and would spend hours reading and playing with them.

The Duchess was reassured by her mother that the split from Prince William would not be permanent

The couple's relationship was briefly put on hold after Kate confronted William about his partying, the book reveals.

She
was left 'humiliated' after pictures were published of William with two
girls at a nightclub in Poole, where he had been posted for a tank 
commander's course.

There had also been earlier reports he had been dancing with another women at Boujis nightclub, in London.

The new book reveals how Kate believed their relationship was finished unless she had his full commitment.

But, at the age of 24, William was scared by commitment and was enjoying his lifestyle in the Army.

In
April 2007 they decided to end their relationship - only for Carole to 
reassure her daughter that the split would not be forever.

Kate and William first met in the summer of 1999 in the 'den' at the prince's country estate, the new book reveals

Kate and William first met in the summer of 1999 in the 'den' at the prince's country estate, the new book reveals.

Two
years before she went to St Andrews, Kate was introduced to the Glosse 
Posse, a group of friends who regularly met at Highgrove, in 
Gloucestershire.

She was introduced to the group by her Marlborough College friend Emilia d'Erlanger.

In
the book, Kate's house mistress Ann Patching explains how: 'We all knew
as teachers that that year group was moving in Royal circles, that they
were friends.'

The
book also reveals how while working in the summer before she started at
university, Kate told a colleague how she had already met the Prince 
‘once or twice’.
