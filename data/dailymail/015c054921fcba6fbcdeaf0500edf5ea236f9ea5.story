Anyone who has ever attempted to sing their heart out in a crowded bar will tell you it isn’t as easy as it looks.

Most people end up sounding like bad karaoke - out of tune and out of their depth - but a true talent will always stand out as one New York bartender proved on Saturday night.

A clip of Joe Ardizzone performing Radiohead’s enduring anthem Creep at Brandy's Piano Bar on Manhattan's Upper East Side has since gone viral with more than 140,000 viewings and over 1,000 likes.

Bartender Joe Ardizzone brought the house down at a Manhattan piano bar recently with his near faultless version of Radiohead's Creep

A video of the heartfelt performance was posted by customer Cody Littlewood who wrote: ‘We were at a piano bar as it was closing down and the bartender stepped up to the mic and did this.

‘He had been behind the bar working a full shift and shouting over the noise for several hours at least.’

Littlewood went on to apologize for his ‘amateur’ vertical filming, but regardless of the quality of the video the clip is well worth watching for the quality of Ardizzone’s singing. 

An absolute natural, he performs with complete control of his voice and gives a soulful rendition of the song without feeling the need to resort to vocal histrionics or posing to entertain the crowd.

Ardizzone has been working - and singing - at the bar on and off for the past ten years

The audience is respectfully quiet throughout, bar occasional whoops of appreciation, and it ends with a well-deserved round of applause

According to the bar’s website, Ardizzone works behind the bar on Monday and Saturday evenings and has been performing and working at the establishment on and off for the past ten years.

A modest Mr Ardizzone also asked for credit to be given to Nate Buccieri who accompanied him on piano.
