Louis van Gaal has used his first programme notes as Manchester United manager to speak of his excitement over the 'special moment' that awaits him when he steps out at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening.

The Dutchman will take charge of United for the first time at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening, when his side take on Valencia.

Writing in the Manchester United match-day programme, Van Gaal said: 'I am looking forward to walking out into the stadium as the manager of Manchester United, as I know it will be a special moment for me.

'I have been here before, of course, as a manager with Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and I know just how difficult it is for visiting teams at Old Trafford. I am really looking forward to having you on the same side as my players.

'After tonight's (Tuesday's) game we will be fully concentrating on the start of the Premier League, which I am really looking forward to. I have managed in Spain and in Germany and in the Netherlands, so there was only one football country I wanted to see inside and that was England, because of the level of the Premier League and because of the atmosphere. I cannot wait to get started.

Van Gaal also praised his new players for the manner of their pre-season victory over Liverpool in the United States, when United reversed a 1-0 deficit to emerge as 3-1 winners, with Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard scoring the goals.

The Dutchman said: 'I wanted to see an improvement in our performances as the tour went along, and that was mainly the case. In the first of the match against Liverpool, I must say that we were very weak, but the spirit of the team turned that around.

'The players wanted to show themselves as a team and that is very important for me. I could see winning that particular match brought a lot of pleasure to our fans, and I was pleased that we were able to make them happy.
