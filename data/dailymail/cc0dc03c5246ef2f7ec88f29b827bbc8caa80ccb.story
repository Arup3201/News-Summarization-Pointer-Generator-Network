The Spanish nurse who survived Ebola has spoken for the first time about her ordeal, saying the worst part was learning her dog had been put down.

Teresa Romero has been in quarantine in Madrid since October 6 after she became the first person to contract the disease outside Africa while treating two infected missionaries.

After learning Mrs Romero had become infected, Spanish authorities quarantined her and her husband, and put down the family dog Excalibur - claiming it could have spread the disease.

Teresa Romero (pictured), the Spanish nurse who has survived Ebola, has spoken of her ordeal for the first time - saying the worst moment was when she learned her dog had been put down

Mrs Ramos, who has been in quarantine since October 6, says she plans to get a new puppy - 'a little Excalibur' - after authorities had her old dog put down over fears it could spread Ebola

Mrs Romero said: 'The worst part was in regard to my dog. Now I'm going to get a puppy. A little Excalibur.'

Mrs Romero has tested negative for the infection twice in the last week, with 48 hours between each test, but will remain in hospital until she is fully recovered. 

Speaking about her recovery, she added: 'I feel newborn, that is how I feel. I have had a very hard time. I told [my family] I was feeling very bad. 

'I told them that I was sick, that I was feeling awful. But I also told them to stay calm.

'What they do is to cheer me up. They tell me they are longing to take off their protective suits to hug and kiss me.

'They cheer me up constantly and ask my what I need all the time. I am thankful to death for them.'

Mrs Romero caught Ebola after treating Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with Ebola while he treated patients in Sierra Leone.

Thousands of protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against officials' decision to put the animal down without testing to see whether it was infected first

Innocent animal: Ms Romero's husband Javier Limon Romero, was was under quarantine until yesterday, has also questioned the decision to put the animal down

Another Spanish priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, had died in Madrid in August after being flown back from missionary work in Liberia. 

She was quarantined along with 14 other people who had come into contact with her for 21 days - the incubation period for the disease - though all have now been cleared.

However the decision by Spanish authorities to put down her dog, Excalibur, without testing the animal to see whether it was infected caused widespread protests.

At a news conference last week, her husband Javier questioned why the decision had been taken, saying the animal had not been to blame 'for anything'.

Yesterday, Mr Romero went further, describing the animal as 'the son we never had', and adding that authorities had given him no chance to argue against the decision. 

In the U.S. a dog belonging to a nurse infected with Ebola was quarantined and tested negative, before being released.

Mrs Romero became the first person to be infected with Ebola outside Africa after treating two missionaries. Her infection drew protests, with workers saying they were not being given the proper safety equipment

Thousands of angry protesters marched in the streets of Madrid calling on the government's health minister Ana Mato to resign after the pet's death on October 8.

Ms Romero's recovery could prompt further criticism by the protesters, 390,000 of whom signed a petition urging officials to save Excalibur's life.

Ms Romero was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name.

One was the experimental anti-viral medicine favipiravir, according to the respected national newspaper El Mundo.

Romero was the only known sufferer of Ebola in Spain after the death of the two priests.
