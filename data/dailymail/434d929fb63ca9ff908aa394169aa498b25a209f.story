A woman has been ordered to pay more than £4,000 in compensation to the cheated wife of her married lover.

Finance manager Naledi Mogae sued Kemiso Dijokota in a Botswana court for 'actively pursuing' her husband while she was away on business.

Mrs Mogae, who works for a Christian charity and often has to travel to various locations in southern Africa, claimed that Miss Dijokota would move in and act as a 'wife' in her absence, according to The Voice newspaper in Botswana.

Mrs Mogae hid cameras in her and her husband Kenneth's bedroom to catch his infidelity.

Donga Customary Court president Tebogo Stephen described the evidence as 'watertight and indisputable'.

Miss Dijokota had originally pleaded not guilty to wrecking her love rival's marriage, when Mrs Mogae says that her and her husband were working on their nuptials.

Although she originally sued for 80,000 pula (£5,883), the judge ordered Miss Dijokota to pay 60,000 pula (£4,412).

If the 26-year-old petrol station worker from Francistown fails to pay the debt then her property will be confiscated and sold off so that Mrs Mogae can be paid.

She has been told to pay 500 pula (£36.80) a month until the compensation is paid.

A delighted Mrs Mogae said that she hopes the result of the case will deter other women from targeting married men.

According to The Voice, Mr Mogae declined to comment following the case.

It is unclear whether the couple managed to save their marriage.
