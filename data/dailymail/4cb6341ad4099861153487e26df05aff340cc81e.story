A mother who kidnapped her children from their custodial grandmother and sailed with them to Cuba wants a divorce from husband so she can be with a female former inmate.

The news came as Sharyn Hakken and her husband Josh both took separate plea deals to avoid going to trial. 

The couple, from Tampa, Florida, were charged with kidnapping, interference with child custody and neglect in April after they allegedly kidnapped two-year-old Chase and four-year-old Cole from the boys' grandparents, who had been granted custody of them just a week earlier.  

Joshua pleaded guilty to four charges and could serve as many as 15 years in prison while Sharyn accepted a deal that includes a potential 10-year prison sentence on two counts of kidnapping. 

Joshua (left) and Sharyn Hakken, (right)  from Tampa, Florida, have taken separate plea deals to avoid going to trial. Now it has emerged that Sharyn wants to end her marriage to Josh as she has fallen for a former inmate

Today it was revealed that that Sharyn wants to end her marriage to Josh in order to be with a former jail mate.

'They have no relationship as far as she is concerned,' attorney Bryant Camareno said, reports Fox 13.

'She does want to get a divorce and she is currently in another relationship.' 

Earlier this month prosecutors shared a bizarre love letter Sharyn Hakken sent to a 26-year-old woman whom she met in prison, in which she tells the former inmate she is '100% committed to you and our relationship'. 

Only last week jail cell footage was released showing the couple desperately urging each other to stay quiet with Joshua Hakken saying to his wife: 'When everything goes down I'll come find you'

The woman, Lacrecia White, gave an interview to ABC Action News and explained that they had hit it off while playing cards together in jail in July.

As part of the documents prosecutors released in the Hakken case, they shared a letter written from Sharyn Hakken to a woman.

The woman, Lacrecia White, told ABC Action News that they had met in prison in July before she was released. 

Here are some excerpts from the letter from Hakken:'I hope I dream about you tonight. I need to see you and feel you. 

'I love you. Ugh I so badly wish we could hold each other right now. I wanna play with your hair!

'I am so super excited about our future together...I want to talk to you and hear your voice sooo bad... So how are you my beautiful girl? I miss you so much.

'I love you so much. I hope you really do know that by now... I am 100% fully committed to you and our relationship!

'Let's get married! (I'm totally serious unless you think I'm crazy then haha jk [just kidding])'

'I've been nervous that yours and my relationship could hurt my case in some way and that my lawyer would find out and tell me to stop talking to you. I don't think I'd be able to!

One letter from Hakken reads: 'I want to talk to you and hear your voice sooo bad. So how are you my beautiful girl? I miss you so much. I'm glad I stayed up so late writing to you last night.

'I love you so much. I hope you really do know that by now... I am 100% fully committed to you and our relationship!'

White, who has since been released on probation and is training to become an electrician, said that Hakken spends her days doing yoga and missing her children.

'I know that her overall goal is to get her kids back. She says that when she gets out of jail, she wants to start in with a case plan, if that's even possible,' said White.

'We'll definitely keep writing each other. I need her support and she needs a friend right now.' 

After the couple were tracked down in Cuba and returned to the U.S., they were held in a Hillsborough County jail, where surveillance cameras filmed their conversations on April 10.

'Be careful what you say to your cellmates,' Joshua Hakken, 45, says to his wife. 'No one can know about this.'

'I know, I know, I know,' responds Sharyn Hakken, 34, later adding, 'I said too much on the plane', as her husband comforts her, ABC News reported.

The couple also apparently discussed their release from jail.

When everything goes down I'll come find you,' Joshua Hakken said, with his wife adding: 'If I get out before you, I promise I'll wait for you.'

Prosecutors plan to present the footage as evidence at a trial later this year.

They also released photographs taken inside the Hakken's sailboat that show two child car seats, a gun and ammunition. 

The letters called White her 'soul mate' and tell her she is 100% committed to their relationship

Prosecutors said the Hakkens had become paranoid about living in the U.S., claiming the government was trying to hack their computers and poison them. 

They had asked 11 countries for asylum, documents show.

They lost custody of the boys last year after police officers in Louisiana found them and the children in a hotel room surrounded by weapons and drugs.

On April 3, Joshua Hakken allegedly forced his way into his mother-in-law's home, tied her up and put the boys in his car, before setting sail for Cuba.

Officials in Cuba learned that the parents were wanted in connection with a kidnapping and contacted U.S. authorities, who flew them back.

The couple's boat, 'Salty', is pictured moored at the Marina Hemingway complex in Havana on April 9 last year, six days after the couple allegedly set sail from Florida with their sons on board

Chase, two, and four-year-old Cole were safely returned to the care of their grandparents last April after allegedly being abducted by their parents

When the boys were returned, their maternal grandparents Patricia and Bob Hauser revealed that the youngsters, who were not harmed, did not know they were allegedly kidnapped. 

They have been told that everyone heard about their sailboat trip to Cuba - 'another country', as they call it,' Mrs Hauser said at a press conference. 'And their airport ride back to America, and that everyone wants to take their picture... We are treating it as if they went on a vacation.'

Mr Hauser said that they had never imagined they would be bringing up Cole and Chase - but that the 'smart, chatty' boys were a joy each day.

'It was initially a change of life-style for us, but having these boys here is just amazing,' he said.

'I come home from work at the end of a bad day and the two will come running up hugging and kissing me [saying] 'Papa's home! Papa's home!' It's just wonderful. We wouldn't trade it for anything.' 

If convicted of the kidnapping charges at trial, the Hakkens could have been sentenced to life in prison. 

They will be sentenced October 8.
