Clive Palmer's Palmer United Party will support the repeal of the carbon tax, the billionaire politician announced on Wednesday.

With climate change campaigner and former U.S. vice president Al Gore by his side, Mr Palmer said his senators will support the repeal on the condition that the renewable energy target remains until at least 2016 and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Climate Change Authority are kept, in a press conference at Parliament House

Mr Palmer also outlined plans for an emissions trading scheme with a zero-dollar starting price to be legislated but would only be enacted if Australia's major trading - including the U.S, China, the EU, Korean and Japan - partners did the same, another condition of his support.

Clive Palmer has announced his Palmer United Party senators will support the repeal of the carbon tax, but he outline a series of conditions including an emissions trading scheme

At the beginning of his address, Mr Palmer said his discussions today with Mr Gore, who narrated the award-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth and wrote the book of the same name, enabled him to reconsider 'important issues facing all Australians and the rest of the world'.

In voting to repeal the carbon tax in the senate and keeping his party's election promise, Mr Palmer said it was not the 'Labor way or Liberal way, it's the right way that's important for Australia and important for the world'.

However, Palmer United senators will move an amendment calling for all energy producers to be required by law to pass on the savings from the repeal of the tax to all energy consumers.

'I expect that all senators from all parties will support this amendment,' Mr Palmer said.

He said action by his senators will make Australian industry more competitive internationally and that the carbon tax had set a price on carbon much higher than the rest of the world, hence his support for abolishing it.

During his press conference from Parliament House, Mr Palmer was joined by climate change campaigner and former U.S. vice president Al Gore

Mr Gore commended Mr Palmer's address as an 'extraordinary moment' for the world: 'In which Australia, the United States and the rest of the world is finally beginning to confront the climate crisis in a meaningful way.'

He said Mr Palmer's plans were 'significant' in supporting the world moving to solve the climate crisis and the Palmer United Party supporting the continuation of the renewable energy target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Climate Change Authority and reintroducing an emissions trading scheme under his stipulated conditions.

'While I will be disappointed if the immediate price on carbon is removed, because it is a policy which I believe to be ultimately critical to solving the climate crisis, I am extremely hopeful that Australia  will continue to play a global leadership role on this most pressing issue,' he said.

He said Mr Palmer's proposals were all 'high effective' in reducing carbon emissions.

With that, Mr Palmer announced they had to go to an 'urgent dinner' and left before any questions could disturb the lovely atmosphere. 'We'll be back later', he said.

The release of the An Inconvenient Truth book and film in 2006 brought the issue of global warming to the forefront of international agenda.

'Extraordinary moment': Mr Gore commended Mr Palmer for taking action on climate change

Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to office in September 2013 promising to abolish Labor's carbon tax and replace it with a $2.5 billion Direct Action plan.

However, from July 1, when the Senate numbers change, the government will need the support of six out of eight crossbench senators to pass the repeal and abolish climate-related bodies.

The Palmer United Party, which will have three senators plus the support of the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party's Ricky Muir, went to the election promising to abolish the carbon tax.

Mr Palmer, who will meet with Mr Abbott in Canberra on Thursday, said that remained his party's position but it would come with conditions.

Direct Action would be opposed and instead an emissions trading scheme would be legislated, taking effect when Australia's global trading partners put in place similar schemes.

Crossbench senators-elect David Leyonhjelm and Bob Day have signalled they will vote to abolish the carbon tax, but it is unlikely they would support an emissions trading scheme.

The Democratic Labour Party's John Madigan opposes the carbon tax, and independent Nick Xenophon wants greater government assurances that what replaces it will significantly reduce emissions.

Under the existing emissions trading scheme, the carbon price is due to rise to $25.40 a tonne on July 1, moving to a flexible price from July 1, 2015.

Labor announced before the 2013 election it wanted to abolish the fixed carbon price and move to an emissions trading scheme in 2014.

A spokeswoman for Mr Abbott said the prime minister welcomed the PUP's support in scrapping the carbon tax.

'We're committed to our budget measures and will continue to talk respectfully and constructively with all senators and members,' she said.

Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt, pictured left, and Greens leader Christine Milne have both reacted to Mr Palmer's announcement 

Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt said Mr Palmer's announcement was 'vindication for the government because our plan to deliver genuine savings' by abolishing the carbon tax.

'The Australian people voted for this change, we stood on this change, and now we see the senate is set to accept this change - this is unambiguously good news for Australian families,' Mr Hunt said in a conference shortly after Mr Palmer's.

Greens leader Christine Milne said while she was pleased to see the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Climate Change Authority continue, but she wanted clarity from Mr Palmer about his 'vague' proposal on a price on carbon in light of the current 'working' emissions trading scheme and if this will be supported.
