Newcastle’s Sammy Ameobi has opened talks over a potential summer transfer to join David Moyes at Real Sociedad.

Moyes is a big admirer of 22-year-old Ameobi, who is out of contract at the end of the season and already free to talk to foreign clubs and sign a pre-contract agreement.

Newcastle would be entitled to a compensation fee but it is likely to be less if he moves abroad.

Moyes is also keen on Burnley’s Danny Ings, who is in a similar contractual situation, and would like to sign both players.

But the former Everton and Manchester United manager fears he is losing the battle to take Ings to North Spain.

Sammy’s brother Shola, 33, left Newcastle to try his luck abroad last year but returned to England in January after six months in Turkey with Gaziantep.

Moyes is a keen admirer of Danny Ings and has held talks with the forward but the deal looks unlikely
