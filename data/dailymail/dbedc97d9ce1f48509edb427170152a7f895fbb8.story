A woman in her fifties feared for her life after weight gain sent her blood pressure to dangerously high levels.

Julie Betty, 51, from Somerset, was dependent on various medications due to her ill-health and feared her days were numbered.

She told MailOnline: 'I was being monitored weekly for my 
dangerously high blood pressure. I took five tablets a day and I was 
very worried. I was afraid I was going to die.'

Slimmed down: Julie Betty now weighs 11st 5lbs and is a dress size 10-12, left. Before, right, she was 17st 5lbs and a size 20

Growing up, Julie had always been fit and active but in 2006 she had an accident where she damaged her shoulder and so was unable to exercise.

Her weight crept up until by the time she was aged 50, she tipped the scales at 17st 5lbs.

She said being a dress size 20 made her feel self-conscious and unhappy.

She explained: 'I was morbidly obese and depressed - I was at my lowest point in my life. I sat at home with the blinds closed and wouldn't want to see or speak to anyone.

'My damaged shoulder gave me 
constant pain so I couldn't exercise to lose the weight. But my 
weight made me feel depressed and lacking in energy, I couldn't be 
bothered to do anything anyway.'

But when Julie heard how her raised blood pressure was endangering her life, she knew she had to do something to become healthier.

Concern: Julie's weight sent her blood pressure to dangerously high levels

She decided to try the 'Body by Vi Challenge' after her daughter, Ami Pow, 29, lost 2st 4lb on the diet plan which involves substituting some meals with replacement shakes for 90 days.

Julie said: 'I was sceptical about the challenge at first, but my daughter had great results so I had nothing to lose - apart 
from the weight! I convinced my husband to follow the plan with me.'

Just ten days into the diet, Julie began to notice a change in her well-being after she lost 10lbs. Her weekly blood pressure check-up with her GP revealed it had dropped for the first time in eight years.

More confident: Julie said losing six stone has given her a new lease of life, left. She said before, right, she felt low on energy and depressed.

She recalled: 'My GP took my blood pressure five times on one arm 
and with two different machines. He wasn't saying anything and I was 
starting to get worried about what he was going to say.

'Finally he 
explained that my weight loss had a huge impact on reducing my blood 
pressure - even my GP was shocked at how much it had reduced.'

The improvement was the incentive Julie needed to stick with the plan and she went on to lose a total of six stone.

She now weighs 11st 5lbs and is a dress size 10-12.

Changed her life: As a result of her weightloss, Julie's blood pressure has come down and she feels happier and healthier

Julie said her new slim figure has made her feel young again and full of confidence.

She said: 'Now I feel 21 not 51! As a result of losing the weight I am 
now able to run around with my grandchildren. I'm out partying meeting 
lots of people and helping them improve their lives.'

Best of all, she said dieting has been 'like a miracle' as her blood pressure has reduced so much, she no longer needs to take medication.
