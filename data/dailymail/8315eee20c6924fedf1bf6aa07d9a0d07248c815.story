Police were called to the Los Angeles home of V. Stiviano on Monday morning after someone reportedly smashed a window and attempted to get into the house.

TMZ are reporting the incident happened around 11.30am and that the mistress of LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling was not at home at the time.

The prowler is said to have broken a front window.

Both Stiviano's sister and brother were in the house at the time and heard the commotion.

911: Police have confiremd there was an attempted break-in on Monday morning at the Beverly Hills home of V. Stiviano, the mistress of LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling

Stiviano, who has become something of a media sensation and is known for wearing visors over her face, was not at home at the time of the would-be break-in

It is understand the prowler was scared off when they realized Stiviano's brother and sister were inside the house, on the 8400 block of Fourth St, at the time

When the would-be thief tried to jimmy open a second window, they were scared off after observing the people inside.

However, TMZ are also reporting that no one at the home called 911 until 2.50pm, hours after the incident.

Stiviano is the woman who leaked a phone conversation with Sterling that eventually had him banned from the National Basketball Association and slapped with a $2.5 million.

While Stiviano denies having anything to do with the leak, the tapes had Sterling tell her not to bring black people to his games or pose with them in photos on Instagram.

She had posed in a picture with basketball great Magic Johnson several weeks earlier.

CNN reported Monday evening that Sterling has until May 27 to to respond the NBA after it 'initiated a charge' to terminate his ownership rights in the franchise.

The Clippers owner will reportedly ask for a three-month extension to prepare his response. 

Under
 league rules, Sterling's rights over the franchise can be terminated 
only if 75 percent of the 29 team owners sustain the charge and vote for
 him to sell.

A lawsuit filed by Mr Sterling’s estranged wife of 50 years, Rochelle, claimed to show how the Clipper’s owner treated his girlfriend by lavishing her with a series of gifts including the Ferrari, two Bentleys, a Range Rover and a $1.4 million apartment.

Miss Stiviano has described herself as being Sterling's 'confidante and friend'.

During a television interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Sterling started by apologizing for his racist comments.

'I’m not a racist,' he told Cooper.

'I made a terrible, terrible 
mistake.'

'I’m the guilty one for uttering those 
terrible, ugly words.'

But as the interview progressed he blamed the media for blowing his words out of proportion before going on an angry attack against Magic Johnson, one of the targets of his racist remarks.

Sterling first said the former basketball star was a ‘good person’ but his tone quickly changed and he made a series of disparaging remarks about Johnson's HIV-positive status, dismissing his work in charity and business and saying he's not a proper role model for children.

He then said he believed his estranged girlfriend duped him by recording their private conversations.

‘She would always use the word “black,”’ Mr. Sterling said of Stiviano.

‘That's a black girl, that's a black guy, this is black, that's black. So when she said to me I'm going to bring “four gorgeous black guys to the game,” players she was referring to either football or basketball, I was a little jealous maybe.’

The NBA swiftly punished Sterling following the release of the first recordings, banning him from the league for life and hitting him with a $2.5million fine.

They may also force him to sell the team, and the NBA's Advisory/Fianance committee met by conference call last Wednesday to discuss the possible termination.

The committee released a statement saying they will meet again next week to discuss the matter further.

Former Time Warner Cable head and Obama advisor Dick Parsons has been chosen as the team's interim CEO for the transition period.

Meanwhile, Sterling's estranged wife Shelly hopes to hold on to her 50 per cent stake in the Los Angeles team.
