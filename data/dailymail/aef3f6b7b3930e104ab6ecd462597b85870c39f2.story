Nathan Cleverly has promised to KO Tony Bellew in front of his home fans after agreeing to travel to Liverpool for their rematch.

The Welshman won a tight majority decision victory in 2011 and will return to the Echo Arena on either November 22 or 29.

And this time, Cleverly wants to leave no doubt with a concussive victory.

Nathan Cleverly says he will knock Tony Bellew out in their grudge rematch at Liverpool's Echo Arena

'I cannot wait for this,' he said. 'I beat him in front of his people before and this time I'm going to knock him out in front of his people.

'There will be no final bell in this fight, it's going to be brutal. Expect fireworks from the build-up, the press conferences, the weigh in and the fight but also expect the same result. A Nathan Cleverly victory and then I will become a two-weight world champion.'

Having lost to his bitter rival at light heavyweight, Bellew is confident he can turn the tables at cruiserweight.

And promoter Eddie Hearn told Sportsmail last week that a world title shot was on offer for the winner, likely against Marco Huck.

'I want this more than any fight in the world,' said Bellew. 'I've dreamt about this moment, about putting this right, about ending him. His face will be in my mind every day in camp, every night.

'I can’t explain how badly I want to knock him out and that's exactly how it will end in November. For the people of Liverpool, expect a great occasion, an epic build up and an emotional fight.'
