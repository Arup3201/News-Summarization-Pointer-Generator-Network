Andy Murray recorded yet another victory on Wednesday afternoon – but it was still not enough to guarantee him a place at the season-ending finale at the O2 Arena next month.

The former Wimbledon champion overcame world No 25 Julien Benneteau 6-3, 6-4 in convincing fashion to advance to the last 16 of the Paris Masters.

But with Canada’s Milos Raonic squeezing through a third-set tie-break to stay alive earlier in the day, and Spaniard David Ferrer also notching an early win, he was still having to wait for confirmation that he will make the eight-man field for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.

He can, however, put an end to all the infernal mathematics if he progresses further on Thursday against Grigor Dimitrov. It remains possible that he could technically book his place in London by the end of Wednesday were Kei Nishikori to lose to Tommy Robredo.

In Wednesday's 72-minute advance there were no signs of any physical hangover from his epic win in the Valencia Open on Sunday night, despite this being a sixth consecutive week of tournament play.

In the completely dilapidated Bercy stadium – currently undergoing a major facelift and not before time - Murray wasted no time in getting ahead, with plenty of assistance from his opponent.

Benneteau, who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career at 33, double faulted three consecutive times to hand the 27-year-old Scot a 2-0 lead. Murray’s serve, always an indicator of his confidence levels, was in fine working order and he easily protected that to win the first set.

Playing for the first time in front of coach Amelie Mauresmo in her own country, in the second he also went quickly up and then consolidated it without problems. The only glitch came when he was broken back at 4-1 up, but the cushion of two breaks by then was enough for him to withstand the late improvement of the French veteran.

Wednesday night - 6:30pm (UK time)

If Kei Nishikori loses to Tommy Robredo, Andy Murray has qualified.

Thursday morning from 9:30am

Murray can book his place with victory in his third-round match against Grigor Dimitrov.

If Tomas Berdych OR David Ferrer OR Milos Raonic play before Murray and lose, then Murray has qualified before hitting a ball on Thursday.

Even if Murray loses, it would require an unlikely set of results for him not to qualify.
