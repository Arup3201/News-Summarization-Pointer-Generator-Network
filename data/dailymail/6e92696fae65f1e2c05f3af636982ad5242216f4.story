The current cold spell gripping the UK must be particularly uncomfortable for cyclists enduring cold air whipping past their necks as they navigate the roads.

So they could do with replicating the achievement of Philadelphia cycle courier Rudi Saldia, who has taught his cat to snuggle round his neck as he makes deliveries.

The fearless feline, named Mary Jane, accompanies the elaborately moustachioed Mr Saldia as he rides all around the Pennsylvania city, dropping off parcels and important documents.

Give us a nuzzle! Mary Jane the cat rubs her whiskers against her owner, bike courier Rudi Saldia - who boasts some rather impressive whiskers of his own - as they ride together around the streets of Philadelphia

Born in a closet drawer in Mr Saldia's bedroom on April Fools, Mary Jane had an unusual start in life.

And after Mr Saldia discovered her favourite spot to rest was his shoulders he decided to train her to accompany him to work.

Now the pair are a regular sight on Philadelphia's streets, with Mary Jane so comfortable on her perch that she doesn't even need to use her claws to keep a grip.

Day-long hugs aside, she keeps her owner happy with an occasional nuzzle and looks about to see if there are any dangers nearby - although she bravely keeps her spot amid the heaviest traffic.

As with most cats, her night-time activities are unknown. But the way she shrinks behind Mr Saldia's shoulders when a police siren is heard suggests that she gets up to her fair share of mischief.

The most recent video of the pair was shot as a promotion for GoPro, which market a range of rugged video cameras and mounts to allow users to document their activities.

The company has enlisted a host of extreme sportsmen - and curious characters like Mr Saldia and Mary Jane - to make videos about their activities for the GoPro YouTube channel.

Mr Saldia, a courier for IDS, said last year: ‘MJ is my first cat and a friend said I could train her - so I got her to sit on my shoulder.

‘The first day we managed one block. The next day we managed two blocks and now we can do around 25 miles with her on my shoulder.

‘MJ enjoys the wind rushing through her fur and she moves around from shoulder to shoulder.’

Not satisfied with a mere 25 miles, Mr Saldia hopes that he will be able to do 100 miles with MJ by next September.

‘People don't know what to make of it - they always do a double-take,' he told Sydney's Telegraph newspaper.

‘I don't get to see most reactions. When I do hear people yell, I typically hear "Oh my God, he has a cat on his shoulder! That's so cute".

‘People always come up and want to pet her and are blown away by the fact she arrived via bicycle.

‘MJ is so comfortable on my shoulder she never uses her claws. My shoulder and back are scratch free.’
