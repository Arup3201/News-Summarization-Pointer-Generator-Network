Spanish newspapers have been reacting to the news that Fernando Torres is set to return to his boyhood club Atletico Madrid.

The 27-year-old is currently on a two-year loan at AC Milan from Chelsea, but has failed to impress so far and the deal is set to be cut short so he can return to Spain. 

Alessio Cerci, meanwhile, is preparing to move in the opposite direction.

Spanish paper Marca is one of the papers to have led their post-Christmas news with Torres, referring to him as 'el delantero, y symbolo rojiblanco', which translates as 'Atletico symbol and striker'.

Torres joined Milan in the summer as he looked to rebuild his career following a largely unsuccessful few years at Chelsea, but failed to impress at the San Siro with just a single goal in 10 appearances. 

Spanish paper AS also delivers the news that  Torres is set to return to Atletico Madrid

Elsewhere, fellow Spanish paper AS has also reported that Torres is set for the move, with a deal that will run until the summer of 2016.

The 30-year-old first left Atletico to join Liverpool in 2007, and was one of the best strikers in the Premier League and Europe as he scored 81 goals in 142 games in all competitions.

A record £50million move to Chelsea followed in January 2011, but he struggled to show the same form at Stamford Bridge as he did on Merseyside and, following the arrival of Diego Costa in the summer, was deemed surplus to requirements.
