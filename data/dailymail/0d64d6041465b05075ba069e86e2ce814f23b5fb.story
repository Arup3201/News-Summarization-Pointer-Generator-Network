Virtual: Cash is being used less and less and banks keep developing new, easy ways of using debit cards

Cash is being killed off by the banks as they push customers to switch to cards, automated payments and a new service which is linked to mobile phone numbers.

Notes and coins now account for only £17.99 of every £100 spent, down by £3.03 on a year ago, according to the Halifax.

The banks are keen to push for the demise of cash and cheques because these are much more expensive for them to transport, handle, count and process than electronic payments.

From today they will also put further pressure on cash with the launch of a service that allows quick electronic payments to be made using mobile phone numbers linked to current accounts.

Called Paym, it is backed by all the high street banks and initially will be available to 30million people before being extended to nine out of ten accounts by the end of the year.

However, virtual money is not universally welcomed by customers, because many do not trust banks to ensure the electronic payments system is reliable and secure.

There have been a number of instances in recent years of customers being locked out of their bank accounts and blocked from using cards at tills by serious bank IT failures.

Banks and stores have also made it increasingly difficult for customers to use cheques, banning them from many petrol  stations and supermarkets, while energy firms impose charges on those who pay using cheques.

In time, this pattern is likely to be repeated for cash.

However, the Halifax director of personal current accounts, Anthony  Warrington, insisted such change is being led by customers rather than the industry.

‘Cash continues to decline as more customers prefer the convenience of paying on plastic and automated payments,’ he said.

Convenient? Halifax claims the gradual move away from cash is driven by customers favouring convenience

The Halifax figures show debit cards account for £28.87 in every £100 of spending, direct debits for £19.90, cash for £17.99, so-called ‘faster payments’, which covers internet and smartphone transactions, for £12.81, cheques £11.28, standing orders £7.82 and other bill payments at £1.34.

The Paym service – pronounced ‘pay em’ – has been described as the first industry-wide collaboration in the UK which could potentially link up every bank account with a mobile number.

It will allow cash to be transferred 
on a mobile by using the recipient’s phone number rather than a bank 
account number and sort code.

The system will be integrated into 
customers’ existing mobile banking apps.

Generally,
 users will be able to transfer up to £250 a day. Those who want to 
receive money will need to register their mobile number with a current 
account.

The Payments Council, which is overseeing the initiative, said: ‘Paying someone back just got easier for millions of people.’

However, research by Consumer Intelligence shows half the population – 47 per cent – have no intention of using it.

The majority of these – 71 per cent – had concerns about security, while  39 per cent were worried what would happen if their phone were stolen and 32 per cent had fears about paying the wrong person.

David Black of Consumer Intelligence said: ‘It’s clear the banking industry has a job to do to educate customers that mobile payments are a safe and consumer-friendly development.’

Barclays already operates a mobile phone payments service called ‘Pingit’.

Another scheme, called Zapp, is set for launch this autumn, while PayPal, the internet payment specialist owned by eBay, has its own system.

Initially, Paym can be used by Halifax, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Santander, Bank of Scotland, TSB, Cumberland Building Society and Danske Bank customers.

A voluntary industry code will help people who accidentally send money to the wrong account to get it back, but there is no guarantee of a refund.

If you're fed up with your bank and thinking of switching, there are plenty of incentives to move.This is Money's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are.

Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promising new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit.

First Direct pays
£100 to new customers who switch to its First Account. On top of that, 
the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a
further £100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 
months.

The Co-op, too, has introduced a £100 cash incentive for new customers. It will also donate £25 to charity on your behalf.

If you switch your main current 
account to one of the Post Office’s Standard, Packaged or Control 
current accounts the bank will give you a £100 gift card.

Lloyds Bank is tempting 
desperate savers with its Club Lloyds current account - offering up 
to 4 per cent for balances between £4,000 and £5,000. But you will have to pay in at least £1,500.

TSB has also recently launched an interest-paying, the Plus Account pays 5 per cent on balances of up to £2,000 and only requires a minimum monthly deposit of £500.

Santander's 123 current account, on the other hand, pays interest on in-credit balances
- 1 per cent on balances between £1,000 and £2,000, 2 per cent between 
£2,000 and £3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £3,000 and £20,000.

Nationwide FlexDirect offers to pay 5 per cent interest on balances up to £2,500 for the first year, while its FlexAccount delivers
free travel insurance. It also operates a Refer a Friend scheme, 
whereby both parties will receive £50 if an existing customers 
successfully recommends friends or family to the bank.                                                                                 By Amy Andrew
