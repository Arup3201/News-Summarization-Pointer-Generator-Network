Jason Holt sent Hearts on their way to a 2-0 victory and nine-point lead over 10-man Rangers in the Scottish Championship.

The recalled Holt swept an excellent shot home following a half-cleared cross in the 56th minute to continue his side's perfect home record following a brutal contest in front of a sell-out 17,004 crowd at Tynecastle.

Jamie Walker finished the visitors off with an 88th-minute penalty after being brought down by Ian Black.

Rangers played most of the match a man down following the dismissal of Steven Smith in the 21st minute

Holt celebrates in front of the ecstatic home fans after he broke the deadlock early in the second half 

There were nine yellow cards but it was a 21st-minute red for Rangers midfielder Steven Smith that defined the contest as his unnecessarily robust challenge on Callum Paterson deep inside the Hearts half put his team under pressure following a positive start for the visitors.

Manager Ally McCoist is also up against it as he bids to get Rangers' faltering title challenge back on track.

The club's record goalscorer was subjected to cries of 'Ally, Ally, get to f***' by a significant section of the away support although they were soon drowned out by chants of 'Super Ally' from other Rangers fans, mockingly backed by the home supporters.

Jamie Walker made sure of the result for Hearts by converting an 88th-minute penalty 

McCoist's team selection gave an indication of the impending physical contest with Jon Daly coming in for Kris Boyd up front and Bilel Mohsni restored to central defence. The fit-again Lee Wallace also came in.

The first 30 seconds further signalled the battle to come as the game had to stop with Paterson and Wallace both on the deck following separate challenges.

Rangers started the better side, forcing Hearts back and making them defend. Hearts, who were again without skipper Danny Wilson and main striker Osman Sow, could not get forward-thinking midfielders Jason Holt, Jamie Walker and Billy King on the ball. Rangers were edging the battle and right-back Darren McGregor saw a close-range shot diverted wide after a corner.

But Smith was overly physical when he threw himself into a challenge with studs showing. Paterson got the ball away and Smith caught him on his foot with Craig Thomson quickly producing the red card.

The dismissal did not immediately change the game though and Mohsni and Wallace fired off target following free-kicks into the box with Paterson and Morgaro Gomis booked as the hosts struggled to get a grip.

Both goalkeepers were called into action to push away free-kicks from Nicky Law and Alim Ozturk and Hearts improved in the closing stages of the half.

Gomis fired a left-footed strike just wide from 25 yards before Steve Simonsen leapt to touch Brad McKay's looping header from 15 yards on to the bar following a deflected cross from Miguel Pallardo. And Kevin McHattie curled not far wide with his right foot after a good passing move down the left.

Ozturk came close from 40 yards just after the interval before the next flashpoint which saw Kenny Miller booked for a late sliding tackle that forced McHattie off on a stretcher.

Miller was subsequently taken off, much to his visible disappointment, to huge jeers and Richard Foster came on.

Souffian El Hassnoaui soon followed, having never looked properly mobile following an early foul by Ian Black, but his replacement James Keatings was quickly involved in the opener.

The forward's attempt to throw a leg at Paterson's cross forced Lee McCulloch into a half-clearance which fell perfectly for Holt 18 yards out. The midfielder swept a first-time effort into the corner of the net.

Rangers almost hit back instantly but Neil Alexander blocked Law's volley and Foster's attempt to follow up was deflected on to the bar.

Law soon appealed strongly for a penalty after Paterson slid but Thomson was unconvinced and booked Black for his remonstrations.

There were further bookings for Hearts substitute Adam Eckersley, Daly, Pallardo and McGregor as the home side defended their lead with increasing comfort.

King fired just wide from long range before the introduction of Boyd for Lewis Macleod, with 10 minutes remaining, sparked the decidedly mixed reaction for McCoist.

Hearts survived without further scare and Walker missed a chance on the break before he won the penalty as Black barged into the back of him on another counter-attack.

Boyd rounded off the booking count with a poor challenge on McKay borne from sheer frustration.
