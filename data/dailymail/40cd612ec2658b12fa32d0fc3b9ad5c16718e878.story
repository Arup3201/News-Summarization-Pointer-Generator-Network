A British climber is recovering in hospital today after cheating death by 'swimming' an avalanche in the Italian Alps.

The unidentified man was with two other Britons, Ben Tibbetts and Misha Gopaul, when the drama took place on Mont Blanc, Europe's highest peak.

They were caught out as they made their way down the 4,800m-high mountain after setting off from their base camp at 2am.

As descended the Aiguelle di Bionnassy, 
the group was struck by a huge wall of snow and ice which Mr Tibbetts, 
31, and Mr Gopaul, 33, were able to avoid but which carried their 
companion away.

Aosta police chief Delfino Viglione said: 'The climber who was caught in the avalanche survived but he was very, very lucky.

'He was hit by the full force of the avalanche, but instead of being buried he managed to swim it for 700m before coming to a stop.

'The swimming action helped him stay near the surface of the snow and he was able to walk out of the avalanche.

'He had to be picked up by helicopter as the mountain rescue teams could not reach him - but the main thing was he survived.

'Climbers
sometimes have airbags to help them float and not be buried when they 
are hit by an avalanche, but he had no such equipment.

'Rescue
teams said he was lucky to be alive, and apart from a few cuts and 
bruises he has no serious injuries. He will go home in one piece.'

Mr Tibbets, from Hereford, and Mr 
Gopaul, from London, were also helicoptered off the mountain but were 
uninjured and could make their way, to Chamonix over the border in 
France, where they had started their climb.

Speaking from Chamonix, Mr Tibbetts said:'It was an unfortunate accident. Avalanches are difficult to predict.

'We were a group of three and one of us got hit but myself and Misha didn't and are OK. The other guy is very, very fortunate.

'He didn't have an airbag on him as we were travelling light. He was carried quite a way down but he survived.

'He rode the avalanche, floated near the top and managed to walk away at the end of it. He's got a few bruises and is a bit shocked but otherwise OK.'

The injured man is being treated in a hospital in Aosta and has declined to comment on his lucky escape.
