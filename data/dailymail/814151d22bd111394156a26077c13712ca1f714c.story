Henning Berg has vowed to fight UEFA all the way after describing Legia Warsaw’s expulsion from the Champions League as ‘devastating’.

In a brief spell as a Rangers defender the Norwegian suffered five straight defeats in Old Firm games. Wednesday’s 3-0 loss to Celtic – the goals scored by UEFA’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary body - was by far the hardest to accept.

Legia Warsaw’s misfortune is difficult to overstate. A catalogue of painful ‘ifs': If Callum McGregor fails to score an away goal Celtic are out. If their captain Ivica Vrdoljac scores one of two penalties Celtic are out. If they leave Bartosz Bereszynski on the bench for the last three minutes of a 6-1 aggregate victory Celtic are out. If they name the defender in their squad for the last round clash with St Pats and if UEFA’s match delegate fails to spot the discrepancy Celtic’s final chance is gone.

Fighting talk: Legia Warsaw boss Henning Berg has promised to challenge UEFA's decision

Reprieve? UEFA have launched an investigation into Celtic's Champions League defeat to Legia Warsaw

Bartosz Bereszynski is a Polish international who has won two caps for his country. He started his career at Lech Poznan in 2009 before joining Legia Warsaw in 2013. 

The 22-year-old was suspended for the match having picked up a three match ban last season after being sent off against Apallon in the Europa League. 

He could have served two matches of his suspension in the second round against St Patrick's but Legia failed to register the defender for those matches allowing  Berg to choose from his full compliment of 25 players.

Compounding Legia’s anguish is the discomfort of a Europa League trip to Kazakhstan to face Aktobe. UEFA will tolerate no ritualistic slaughter of sheep which overshadowed Celtic’s visit last year. But the Parkhead side have been spared a trip back. And for that, the Legia official responsible for the most catastrophic admin error in Champions League history will do well to escape the cut.

'We will definitely appeal,' said Berg of the verdict. 'We will appeal it all the way.

'How far? As far as we can because we don’t think this is the right decision.'

Legia argue the punishment does not fit the crime. Club official Dominik Ebebenge blamed human error for failing to register Beresznyski for the previous qualifying games against St Pats - meaning those didn’t count toward his three-game suspension imposed last season.

'The proportion between the error and the consequences is unimaginable,' Ebebenge told reporters after getting UEFA’s verdict. 'The spirits of the players are broken.'

Legia have five days to request written reasons for the decision and another three days from the receipt of those reasons to register an appeal. If the appeal fails they then have the option of taking the matter to Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.

But UEFA have been consistent in their punishment of clubs fielding suspended players, imposing 3-0 defeats on the perpetrators as standard.

Legia Warsaw midfielder Ondrej Duda gave a scathing assessment of Celtic's performance after the first leg, he said: 'St Patrick's playerd a lot tougher against us than Celtic. They gave us a very tough game in Warsaw.

'With Celtic, we didn't know what to expect, but we were expected to easily beat the Irish side, which we did, but only after a big fright and a good performance away. Fortunately, we regained our composure and we are now on the right track.'

Berg cites an instance from 2010 when the governing body fined Debrecen £15,000 but rejected an attempt by opponents Litex Lovech to have them kicked out of the tournament.

Debrecen stressed that they had fielded Peter Mate in good faith as a substitute in Bulgaria when they were already leading 4-1 on aggregate. Crucially, Mate was ineligible, not suspended. Through UEFA eyes there is a difference. Not through Berg’s.

'We worked so hard to get to this position with two fantastic games against Celtic.

'And then everything is taken away.

'We acted in good faith. We made a mistake with the papers for the St Patrick’s two games.

'The player knew he was suspended for three games and didn’t play in the two games against St Patricks or the first game against Celtic.

'It’s very, very difficult to take and I think this goes against every intention of fair play and fair competition.

'You look at Debrechen from Hungary also used a player who was ineligible, but UEFA fined them because they claimed they acted in good faith and it did not affect the result.

'So for them to act different this time is really, really very disappointing.

'We think this is against the very intention of football.

'European football should be about fair play and unfortunately a technical error has been made in our administration to not register his name on a piece of paper when he couldn’t play because he was suspended.

'To throw us out of the Champions League for this is difficult to take.

'For us to get this kind of punishment for this kind of mistake in this situation and take away the dream of these players to compete against the best players in the world on this stage is devastating.'

In an open letter to fans on Legia Warsaw’s official website, club chairman Dariusz Mioduski expressed his disappointment with the decision, but appeared to accept the UEFA decision, making no mention of an appeal.

'We won two matches with class,' he said. 'But we made a mistake on paper and this year we lost the chance to play in the coveted Champions League. The error that should not happen.

'Although the punishment is disproportionate and it is difficult to reconcile with her, now the more we have to show that this club has great character.

'We showed that we can play football at a good European level. That change is for the better. Our players and coaching staff did not disappoint. We’re going in the right direction and show it, fighting for the Europa League and defending the Polish championship.

'As an organisation we have a job to support our players and fans. Today we have to apologise and stay together. This team deserves it.

'Although today sport lost behind closed doors we promise that never again will not make that mistake. We fight on. In this year in the Europa League. In the future the Champions League. '

Many in Poland are less accepting of the decision, former national team goalkeeper and Legia Warsaw player Jan Tomaszewski branding the decision ‘a tragedy and scandal’.

'It’s a tragedy. Culpable negligence on the part of Legia,' thundered Tomaszewski. 'But this should be a financial penalty, not a walkover for Celtic.

'Bereszynski came off the bench when it was an aggregate scoreline of 6-1 to Legia.

'His presence had no influence on the result whatsoever. This confirms that the Champions League is only for the rich.'
