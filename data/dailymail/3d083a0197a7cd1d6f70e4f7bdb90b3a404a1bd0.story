The opera Carmen has featured the most iconic and talented stars of the stage.

But now, two donkeys will enter stage left and take parts in this year’s production at the King’s Theatre in Southsea, Hampshire.

The show, produced and directed by Ellen
Kent, will see Ollie and Rusty appear in two scenes, first in a market 
selling oranges in Act One, and carrying smugglers goods in the second 
act.

Ollie and Rusty’s handlers, Paul and Tracy Hunt, had a tough time getting the stable-mates through their audition successfully.

But the talented donkeys will appear when the touring show goes to Southsea on March 17.

They will join internationally renowned mezzo soprano Nadia Stoianova who has portrayed Carmen in tours across the country.

Paul Hunt also struggled to successfully audition Ollie for the part, but the pair were eventually chosen

Set in Seville, Bizet’s opera features some of the most famous and evocative songs in classical theatre.

The award-winning producer Ellen Kent spent her teenage years in Spain and said she was influenced by the colours and atmosphere of the country.

Ms Kent started the equivalent of the RSPCA in Spain with her mother during her time there.

She has used live donkey's in past productions, including one recently in Dartford's Orchard Theatre.

Ms Kent said that the use of live donkeys helps to create an authentic Spanish feel as well as allow her to raise awareness for donkey sanctuaries in the UK.

She has attempted to include a live donkey wherever possible during her UK tour of Carmen.

In the past she has also included a black stallion in her cast, and used pyrotechnics to give her interpretation of the opera a more visual element.
