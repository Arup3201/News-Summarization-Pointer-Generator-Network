Only working immigrants from Europe should be allowed into Britain, David Cameron suggested yesterday. 

The Prime Minister also said he wanted new restrictions that would mean incomers from the EU having access to state-funded benefits restricted as part of a new relationship between the UK and Brussels.

Mr Cameron warned Paris and Berlin he intends to block moves to allow eurozone nations to come closer together unless Britain is allowed to repatriate some powers from the EU.

Crackdown: David Cameron said the Government should look at making restrictions on access to benefits for migrants

Speaking to Andrew Marr (pictured left), Mr Cameron said only working immigrants from Europe should be allowed into Britain

He said it would be ‘difficult but possible’ to renegotiate a better deal for Britain as the EU thrashes out a new treaty among eurozone countries. Mr Cameron singled out rules on immigration and working hours as vital areas.

‘One of the key reasons of being a member of the European Union are what are called “the key freedoms” – the movement of services, the movement of goods, and the movement of people,’ he said.

‘Now, there are restrictions already on the movement of people if you have, for instance, an emergency. Should we look at arguments about if it should be harder for people to come and live in Britain and claim benefits? Yes, frankly we should.’

Home Secretary Theresa May is understood to be already examining possible curbs on access to welfare for EU citizens, and the rights of their dependants to come to this country. Limits on the number of people from Bulgaria and Romania who can move to live in Britain are due to expire within a year.

The Prime Minister also singled out EU rules limiting working hours as an area of concern. He told BBC1’s  Andrew Marr Show: ‘The working time directive in my view should never have been introduced... because it’s actually affecting things like the way we run our hospitals, rather than simply about business and trade and the single market.’

He again made clear he believes Britain should not leave the EU, but rather negotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship.

Mr Cameron said that voters will be offered a 'real choice' about the UK's membership of the EU

The UK Independence Party has demanded that there be an in-out referendum to decide whether the country stays a member of the EU

Speaking ahead of a key speech later this month in which he will outline his stance on Europe, Mr Cameron said that voters will be offered a ‘real choice’ about the UK’s membership of the EU.

But there would be no in-out referendum, which has been demanded by senior eurosceptic Tories and the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

Mr Cameron added: ‘There is going to be a large negotiation in Europe. When I became Prime Minister, people said to me ‘Don’t worry, the one thing you won’t have is any treaty changes in Europe’.

‘I think we have already had three. One we vetoed so we aren’t involved in at all... and we have had two others. People should be in no doubt that the Conservatives will be offering at the next election a real choice and a real way giving consent to that choice.’

The Prime Minister was then asked by Mr Marr about his previous description of UK Independence Party members as ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. Mr Cameron added: ‘There are some pretty odd people.’

Speaking to Dermot Murnaghan on Sky News, UKIP’s leader Nigel Farage hit back at the swipe.

He said: ‘It shows how disconnected he is. If he wants to go on being rude about me and rude about UKIP well let him do it, we won’t lose any sleep over it.

‘I don’t think there is any prospect of any deal with the Conservative Party all the while that man leads it, given the way he has behaved and his attitude towards us.

‘Look, I would do a deal with the devil if it got us what we need, which is a free and fair referendum so that we in this country can decide who governs us.’
