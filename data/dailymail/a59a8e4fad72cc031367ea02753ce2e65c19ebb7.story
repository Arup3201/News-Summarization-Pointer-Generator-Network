National Geographic Channel is going out of this world for an new TV event, filmed in $100 billion studio that's 250 miles above the Earth's surface and traveling at 4.9 miles per second.

The network on Thursday announced Live From Space, a two-hour special to be broadcast live from the International Space Station and from Mission Control in Houston this March.

Poised 250 miles above the Earth's surface, the ISS makes a global orbit every 90 minutes, meaning this program will take viewers on a trip around our planet.

Ambitious: 'Every day at NGC our team tries to reach for the stars,' National Geographic president Howard T. Owens said.'Now we are literally able to do it.'

The network is promising special shots of sunset and sunrise, as well as city lights, lightning and shooting stars.

Viewers will also get a guided tour of the space station and see experiments conducted in the floating laboratory.

'Every day at NGC our team tries to reach for the stars,' National Geographic president Howard T. Owens said in a press release.'Now we are literally able to do it.

'We are honored to have secured such amazing access to the station and the astronauts living there, and are exhilarated by the tremendous challenge to show Earth live,' Owens continued.

Live From Space will be produced by Arrow Media. 'We're thrilled to be making this unique event for NGC Worldwide,' added Arrow's creative director, Tom Brisley.

'The technological and logistical challenges of broadcasting live from space may be enormous, but there's no bigger buzz than creating mind-blowing content that works in micro gravity, on the world's largest spacecraft!'

Live from Space will simulcast on National Geographic Channel in 170 countries, including Channel 4 in the U.K., as well as other outlets. No air date was announced.
