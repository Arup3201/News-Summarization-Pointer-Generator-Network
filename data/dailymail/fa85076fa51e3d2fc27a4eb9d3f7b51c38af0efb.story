In scenes that wouldn’t look out of place on the Starship Enterprise, these dizzying fly-throughs reveal the vast expanse beyond our solar system.

It might not be Star Trek, but the computer simulations provide an incredible insight into what it would be like to journey through all the known galaxies in our universe.

Using the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (Gama) catalogue, this video accurately plots the universe as we know it today, increasing the sizes of galaxies slightly so they can be viewed.

Gama is an international project that makes use of ground-based and space telescopes to study cosmology and galaxy evolution.

The visualisations released by Durham University are part of new research showing that galaxies in ‘vast empty regions’ of the Universe are ‘aligned into delicate strings’.

Called 'tendrils', these strings of matter may link together in an intricate pattern, according to research by the University of Western Australia.

The universe is full of vast collections of galaxies that are arranged into an intricate web of clusters and nodes connected by long strings.

These huge, empty regions are called voids, and for years, astronomers have been trying to understand the small population of galaxies that inhabit them.

Using data from the Gama survey, Dr Alpaslan found that the small number of galaxies inside these voids are arranged in a way never seen before.

‘We found small strings composed of just a few galaxies penetrating into the voids, a completely new type of structure that we've called “tendrils”,’ said Dr Alpaslan. 

The simulations are perhaps the closet you will get to experiencing warp drive on Star Trek's Starship Enterprise

The
 universe is full of vast collections of galaxies that are arranged into
 an intricate web of clusters and nodes connected by long strings. 

This
 remarkably organised structure is often called the 'cosmic web', with 
busy intersections of galaxies surrounding vast spaces, void of 
anything visible to us on Earth.

To discover tendrils, the Gama team created the largest ever galaxy census of the southern skies using observations from the Anglo-Australian Telescope in New South Wales, Australia.

‘Our new catalogue has looked deeper into space and mapped each patch of sky up to ten times to make sure it's as thorough as possible,’ said Dr Aaron Robotham from The University of Western Australia node of ICRAR.

‘We weren't sure what we'd find when we looked at voids in detail, but it was amazing to find so many of these tendrils lurking in regions that have previously been classified as empty,’ said Dr Robotham.

The Gama team plan to catalogue more tendrils for further study as their detailed map of the universe expands.

Computer simulations suggest that matter in the universe is distributed in a 'cosmic web' of filaments, as seen in the image above from a large-scale dark-matter simulation. The inset is a zoomed-in, high-resolution image of a smaller part of the cosmic web, 10 million light-years across
