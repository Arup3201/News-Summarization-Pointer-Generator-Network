Millwall and Bradford have both been charged by the Football Association with improper conduct following last week's FA Cup replay at Valley Parade.

Bradford manager Phil Parkinson and assistant Steve Parkin have also been charged with improper conduct for their part in a mass melee, sparked when Millwall defender Alan Dunne's first-half challenge on James Hanson sent the striker clattering into the advertising hoardings.

Both clubs have been charged with failing to ensure their players and/or officials conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from provocative behaviour.

Parkinson and Parkin face a similar charge for leaving their technical area during the incident, in which Millwall goalkeeper David Forde raced out of his penalty area to confront Bradford players.

All parties have until Wednesday, January 21 to respond to the charges.

Bradford won the third-round replay 4-0 to secure a trip to Chelsea in the fourth round.
