A vicious thug who battered a pensioner in his own home on his 90th birthday - and who later died in hospital - has been jailed.

Gavin Stubbs, 32, brutally assaulted his neighbour Cecil Darlington after calling at his home on May 8 to wish him a happy birthday.

He broke his nose, wounded his shoulder and spine, gave him a black eye and cut his arm and forehead.

Guilty: Gavin Stubbs, of Rhymney, near Caerphilly, South Wales, admitted at Cardiff Crown Court to causing GBH with intent

At one point Stubbs sat on top of him to deliver a series of frenzied punches and kicks.

Grandfather Mr Darlington died in hospital four months later, although a pathologist said his death could not directly be linked to his attack injuries because of his age.

Stubbs, of Rhymney, near Caerphilly, South Wales, admitted at Cardiff Crown Court to causing GBH with intent.

Condemned: Judge John Rogers jailed Stubbs for nine years

He was jailed for nine years by Judge John Rogers, who said: 'This was a serious attack.'

After the hearing, Mr Darlington's son Brian said: 'I truly believe that if Gavin Stubbs had never entered my father's life, he would still be alive today.

'He was brutally beaten in his own home. He suffered several physical injuries in the attack.

'But it was the psychological effects that were too difficult for him to come to terms with - he suffered from nightmares, flashbacks and post-traumatic stress.

'Nothing we do will bring my father back, it is too late for him.

'But we hope this might act as a warning to other elderly residents to be careful who you let into your home.'
