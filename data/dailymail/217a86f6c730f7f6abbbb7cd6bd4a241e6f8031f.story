Heartbreaking new images taken inside a Turkish refugee camp today show the young lives that have been torn apart by four weeks of fighting in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane.

Having been forced to flee their hometown due to the threat posed by the Islamic State, thousands of desperate families crossed the border into southern Turkey, where they will now be living in tents and basic shelters for the foreseeable future.

Despite the horrific rapes and massacres carried out by the terrorists attacking their home town, the children now living in the Suruc refugee camp remain full of smiles, not yet fully aware of quite how lucky they and their families have been to avoid becoming victims of the extremist horde.

Many of those living in the Suruc refugee camp arrived there four weeks ago, when ISIS first moved into the east Kobane suburbs and their plot to capture the largely Kurdish town emerged. 

Those able to do so fled to the Turkish border where ethnic Kurds on both sides of the crossing frantically cut down the barbed wire fencing that forms much of the incredibly porous 550 mile border between Turkey and Syria.

Not everybody was able to leave the city before ISIS confronted them, however.

Reports from inside the city at the height of the siege last week told of decapitated bodies scattered around Kobane's streets - of a savagery worse than anybody had dared to fear.

Refugees who made it to Suruc tell of witnessing appalling horrors in hushed tones, as if they can barely believe it themselves.

Father-of-four Amin Fajar, 38, said: 'I have seen tens, maybe hundreds, of bodies with their heads cut off. Others with just their hands or legs missing. I have seen faces with their eyes or tongues cut out – I can never forget it for as long as I live. They put the heads on display to scare us all.'

 It worked. Mr Fajar, a floor fitter from Kobane, and his wife and children aged three to 12, ran for their lives.

'The children saw the headless people. They saw them,' he said quietly, sitting cross-legged on a rug in his tent in the squalid refugee camp in Suruc.

Ahmed Bakki, a farmer from a village near Kobane, said his cousin, a 48-year-old father of seven, stayed behind when the rest of the family fled. 'We phoned my cousin and IS answered his phone.

They said, 'We've got his head, and we're taking it to Jarabulus (an IS stronghold)'.'

He added: 'An English teacher in our village tried to reason with them, but they just called him a kaffir [non-believer] and tied him to their car and dragged him away. We heard they beheaded him later. 

'My neighbour was beheaded because they said he was 'delivering vegetables to the kaffir'. They burned his farm, livestock, even his bees – they destroyed everything.' 

Cooking: Those able to do so fled Kobane and travelled to the Turkish border. Once there ethnic Kurds on both sides of the crossing frantically cut down the barbed wire fencing that forms much of the porous 550 mile border between Turkey and Syria

This 'scorched earth' policy is being waged by jihadis whose most brutal members seem to be Europeans. 'They are Chechen, they are English, they are from all over Europe. We know because we can hear their accents,' said Mr Bakki.

This morning fierce street battles broke out in Kobane - the first significant fighting in the city since the majority of ISIS' militants were pushed back into the suburbs two days ago by the most intense coalition bombing raids of the past few weeks.

The clashes came as desperate ISIS jihadists launched a final assault 'on all fronts' to take the town, after the militants felt the full force of American air power last night with sustained bombing raids resulting in a series of spectacular explosions in the besieged Syrian town.

The radical Islamic group has been dramatically pushed back from the town in recent days, having as recently as last week looked like it was about to drive out the last of the brave Kurdish fighters defending it.

As a fresh round of airstrikes rained down last night, the US also ran a series of airdrops for the Kurdish resistance, dispatching weapons and medical supplies. Pyrotechnic tracer ammunition could be seen marking out ISIS targets in the town as the U.S. bombers flew overhead.
