There wasn't much chance of any of the pooches at Crufts today being called a 'dog's dinner'. 

The canines who had arrived at the Birmingham NEC with their owners were being groomed to perfection ahead of a stiff day of competing. 

Scores of pedigrees had their coats fluffed, brushed and blow-dried in order to look their best in front of the judges.

While agility and obedience are key attributes for winning a prize at the show, first-class looks are a must. 

The dogs that compete in the four-day event are some of the best looking in the world and have had their appearance maintained by professionals for several years. 

Although there is a packed schedule of contests for the dogs to take part in, for much of the time they left waiting around for their event to start.

Each animal is assigned a sleeping area, which many of the owners decorate with cushions, pictures and rosettes from previous competitions.

Earlier in the day, the animals had showed up at the arena in a range of outlandish costumes to protect them from the unpredictable British weather. 

Canines were dressed in a range of funky outfits, including onesies, neck scarves and booties, while others had their long coats tied up in what appeared to be hair rollers.

Crufts attracts competitors from all over the globe and has been declared the largest dog show in the world by the Guinness World Records.

While there are numerous competitions within the four-day show, the key trophy that every owner has their eye on is the title Best In Show. 

The event also had a booth for the first time that allowed pets to take their own selfies, operated by a pressure activated mat.

Read on to check out some of the best pictures from the event so far...

DOG SELFIES:

These adorable ‘pug-shots’ were taken by dogs at Crufts using the world’s first gadget to allow pets to take their own selfies.

The Pet Selfie Mirror is operated by a pressure-activated mat - which triggers a camera.

Owners simply have to position their animal on the device and leave their pets to strike a pose.
