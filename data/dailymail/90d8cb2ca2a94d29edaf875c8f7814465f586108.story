The world's oldest living African penguin has undergone $4500 worth of radiation treatment at Colorado State University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital in a bid to extend its life.

Tess, who is 40 years old, was given a concentrated dose of radiotherapy last month to treat the skin cancer in the middle of her beak and right eye.

With Tess now back home at Pueblo Zoo, zoo staff can keep their fingers crossed that she will reach 42 years old and become the world's oldest ever African penguin.

African penguins will likely be completely obsolete in the wild over the next twenty years, CSU said in a release last week.

If Tess's caretakers can raise awareness for the plight of the species through her, her treatment and hopefully the record, then it will be worth it.

Treatment: Concentrated radiation known as electronic brachytherapy was performed on Tess for just under 22 minutes as a non-invasive procedure, CSU said

'Some people would ask, "Why are you putting all of these resources into an individual animal?" But, if this individual animal can tell a story that helps globally with the African penguin, then it’s all worth it,' said Dr. Matthew Johnston, a veterinarian at Colorado State Univeristy's James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital, said in a university release. 

'If we can make people aware of these endangered species, with awareness comes action, and with action comes change. And, ultimately, we help,' Johnston also said.  

Tess's wounds were first spotted following a skirmish at Pueblo Zoo, which passed along tissue samples from an extracted mass to CSU, the university said.

Pueblo Zoo veterinarian Dr. Kathy Wolyn said of Tess - an indoor penguin - in the release 'If you didn’t know her, you would never guess she’s as old as she is. That’s why we wanted to pursue further treatment for her tumor.'

'We would love to see Tess make it to be the oldest penguin on record, which would be 42,' Wolyn also said in a CSU video. 'But she's a special bird and we'd like to keep her around as long as possible, so even if we don't get a cure, at least we're buying her some good quality of life and a little bit longer life.'

CSU said that Tess's mass showed up again and proved malignant. During her stay at the veterinary hospital, the elderly bird underwent a CT scan, which found that her face had a tumor 'about the size of a pinto bean.'

Concentrated radiation known as electronic brachytherapy was performed on Tess for just under 22 minutes as a non-invasive procedure, CSU said.

Dr. Johnston, speaking to MailOnline, said electronic brachytherapy was picked as Tess's treatment after her CT scan.

'Brachytheraphy is a really, really, good therapy for treating small superficial tumors,' he said, explaining that Tess's tumor 'fell into [that] treatment range.'

Johnston said the area where the tumor was turned red and has started to slough off - but that veterinarians must wait four to six weeks to see if more radiation treatments are necessary.

Pueblo Zoo paid $450 out of the $4500 total cost for Tess's treatment, and CSU covered the rest, Johnston told MailOnline.

He explained, 'We don't have the opportunity to use this therapy very often, and we wanted to give it a shot.'

Pueblo Zoo Executive Director Stephanie Stowell said in an email exchange with MailOnline that 'for our little zoo, this cutting edge treatment would normally be outside our reach, but the fine team at the vet teaching hospital agreed to do the work at a significantly reduced rate.

'They saw, as did we, that this was a tremendous opportunity to advance our knowledge of this treatment and it's impacts on non-traditional species. Any costs outside of the discounts and in-kind work that the CSU folks did, will be paid out of our veterinary operating budget for the year.

Stoell said payment is still being worked out between the zoo and the university.

Tess slept in the arms of her zookeeper during her trip back to Pueblo Zoo that night, and her tumor is now shedding, the university said.

Tess spent two weeks in isolation before she re-entered Pueblo Zoo's penguin exhibit and got back into her nest with 33-year-old Mongo, her mate, CSU said.

Pueblo Zoo penguin zookeeper Melanie Pococke said in the university's release 'I have always known that Tess is spectacular and extremely special. It was fun to see the excitement everyone had for her at the CSU vet hospital.I know she has an even larger fan base now. She is an extremely tough girl and will not go down without a fight.'

'She is the oldest African penguin in captivity currently,' Pococke said in CSU's video. 'She is a record-holder for a female. No female has ever made it to 40 before.'
