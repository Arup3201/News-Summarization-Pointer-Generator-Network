When four Asian friends 'go for an English' in hit comedy show Goodness Gracious Me, they ordered their food 'extra, extra bland'.

The hilarious spoof sketch turned the tables on Britons who love to 'go for a curry' and ask for it to be 'extra hot'.

Now Michelin-starred chef Dominic Chapman
is hoping to tempt Indian foodies with a range of traditional British dishes,
from roast chicken and bread and butter pudding to rhubarb tart.

And he promises they will be far from bland.

Spoof: Hit BBC comedy show Goodness Gracious Me say a group of Asian friends order their food 'extra, extra bland'. Now a British chef is taking British food to India - but it won't be bland

Mr Chapman, 40, is part of a team of UK chefs heading to India next month
to showcase the best of British cuisine at a 10-day festival of food called the Taste of Britain Curry Festival in the southern city of Hyderabad.

While the rest of the cooks are offering mild British
curries to the audience, Mr Chapman will be serving up
exclusively British favourites.

Mr Chapman, who until last month ran the one-Michelin star Royal Oak in Berkshire, has created a menu filled with British classics like Lancashire hotpot along with desserts 
including banana Eton mess for Indian diners at the Park Hyatt Hotel.

The Taste of Britain curry festival has been backed by Prime Minister David Cameron.

He said: 'I'm 
delighted to see that more than 200 years after the first curry house 
opened in Britain our unique brand of Asian cuisine is now being sought 
in the countries where it originally came from.

'In
 recent years curry has become part of the British identity - a firm 
favourite that is enjoyed by more than two million people every week. 
But it's so much more than just good food.

'It's
 about talented restaurateurs and chefs; it's about hard-working 
families; it's about enterprising small businesses that provide tens of 
thousands of jobs and it's about bringing in billions of pounds into our
 economy.'

Classic: Mr Chapman will also try his luck with a tradition shepherd's pie

On his traditional British project, Mr Chapman, who is not a curry chef by training, told MailOnline that there was great potential for India to get stuck in to classic pub grub.

He said: 'In India the British classics would go down very, very well - and this is the angle we're looking at.

'At the moment there other cuisines - like Italian restaurants and pizza, alongside the traditional Indian food with the Tandoor ovens and kebabs.

'In Dubai you've got lots of different style of restaurant - why can't you do that in India?

The country's growing - there's absolutely no reason why a pub serving fish and chips, shepherd's pie or a Sunday roast with a pint of beer couldn't all work. There's a taste for it that hasn't been tapped yet, and we want to spread the word about our British cuisine.'

Hyderabad is a city famous for its 
biryani rice-based dishes and a style of cooking from the Mughal empire 
which ruled India in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Syed Ahmed, director of the Taste of Britain Curry Festival which is taking place early June, said: 'We
 know Indians have a sweet tooth, we will take over some puddings like 
bread and butter pudding, rhubarb tart, and lemon tart.

'Dominic is running with a traditional English menu like Sunday roast with chicken, casserole dishes.'

Curry isn't the only Indian food that has made its way onto British tables.

Kedgeree is a traditional British breakfast dish made from curried rice, smoked fish, boiled eggs, parsley and lemon juice.

It may be considered a traditional British breakfast dish, but its roots are well bedded in Indian cooking having started its life as khichari, a humble dish of rice and lentils.

Thanks to the British Raj and the colonisation of the sub-continent the dish was taken, adapted and turned into something more familiar to those serving in India, and it returned to these shores with them.

Similarly, mulligatawny soup  is also an
 Anglo-Indian invention. The name is from the Tamil language of south east India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia, meaning 'pepper water'.

Created by servants for the Raj who 
demanded a soup course from a cuisine that had never produced one.

Piccalilli, meanwhile, is slightly different. It is an English interpretation of Indian pickles, a 
relish of chopped pickled vegetables and spices; regional recipes vary 
considerably.

The word is believed to date from the middle of the 18th century when it appeared in a book for housekeepers.

The origins of Britain's favourite curry, the Chicken Tikka Masala, are hotly debated. Chefs in Glasgow have claimed it was invented there in the 
  early 1970s.

But Delhi's 
  leading food historians have dismissed as 'preposterous', arguing the dish was a recipe devised in the Mughal period.

Another British interpretation of Indian food is the famous balti, invented in Birmingham in the 1970s when a chef moved from making meals for family and friends in the immigrant community to opening a restaurant.

Mr Ahmed, 52, from London, said British curries are popular because they are different to Indian cuisine.

He said: 'Some people will say it's like selling coal to Newcastle or ice to the Eskimos, but I don't see it like this.

'They see our ingredients are better and of premium quality.Â  And
 the dishes are milder and healthier, I don't want to criticise but 
sometimes in India it becomes too spicy and overpowering.

'With the British palate, some people eat hot curries but generally it's milder and it has less ghee and butter.

'When we first went to India in 2006 we thought it was a challenge as curry originates in India but they are food-loving people and like to experiment.'

As well as Mr Chapman and Mr Ahmed six other chefs from Britain will be travelling to the southern city of Hyderabad.

Among the other chefs are Partha Mittra, from Cheshire, Allam Shah Ullah, from Sheffield, Abul Monsur, from Kent, Abdus Shahid, from Bury St Edmunds, Altaf Hussain, from Hertfordshire, and Anwar Hossein, from Sudbury in Suffolk.

One British restaurant boss who has been offered the chance to open a curry house in India is Enam Ali, chair of the Guild of Bangladeshi Restaurateurs.

He was offered a proposal to open a branch of his Le Raj restaurant in Epsom, Surrey, in Kolkata in northern India.

Mr Ali believes British curries will be a long-term success in India.

'The name British curry is trendy and the flavours are different than in India as British curries are not extremely hot. The cooking process is different as in India they cook with a big pot like a Mughal dinner.

'In London, they have followed a bit of French and English style of cooking one dish individually. Bill Gates said to me during the 2012 Olympics our lamb curry was better than in India.'

But curry expert Pat Chapman, author of the Cobra Good Curry Guide, is more sceptical.

He said: 'The reaction of all of my Indian friends to the British Curry is one of disdain.

'Maybe it's an over-reaction; one or two formulaic Bangladeshi curry houses produce excellent food. But I have my doubts that British cuisine will take off in India.'
