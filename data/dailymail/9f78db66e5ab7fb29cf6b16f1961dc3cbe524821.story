Novelist Joanna Trollope said children should return to reading classics such as Austen and the Bronte sisters

Joanna Trollope says children should be taught literary classics in school because they spend too much time reading fantasy books, such as The Twilight Saga. 

The novelist said fantasy teen fiction, such as the hugely popular Hunger Games series, fails to give children an insight into reality or guidance in moral dilemmas. 

The Rector's Wife author said youngsters should be encouraged to read the likes of Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Bronte sisters.

However, she admitted her 12-year-old grandson loves The Hunger Games, about a post-apocalyptic nation in which two children are selected to compete to the death in an annual televised battle.

Trollope told The Sunday Times: 'I feel children are missing out on an enormous amount.

'The consolation to be found in the classics is absolutely infinite and greater than fantasy novels. Fantasy doesn't relate to the real world.'

The author, who used to be a teacher, said using popular culture can be a useful tool to lead children towards the classics.

She said she gave her class The Beatles lyrics to study in one English poetry class before giving them Robert Frost to read.

Last year, the three Hunger Games books were in the top 10 bestsellers list with more than 2.1million sold.

Trollope said classic British novels can provide guidance to children and help them with decisions. 

Trollope is one of six authors invited by the Austen Project to rewrite her works for a modern audience.

Trollope said books like The Hunger Games (Jennifer Lawrence, pictured left, as Katniss Everdeen) and The Twilight Saga (Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in the film version, right) do not 'relate to the real world'

Trollope has rewritten Sense and Sensibility (pictured Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet in the 1995 film) for a modern audience. She said the book's themes are still relevant today

She is working on Sense and Sensibility and said issues the book tackles, such as class and money, are still important today.

In her updated version, Elinor Dashwood is an architecture student while her creative sister Marianne goes to art school.

It includes social media, iPods and fast cars.

Other contemporary writers involved in the project are Alexander McCall Smith (Emma), Val McDermid (Northanger Abbey), U.S. writer Curtis Sittenfeld (Pride and Prejudice).

Two other writers will be named later this year.
