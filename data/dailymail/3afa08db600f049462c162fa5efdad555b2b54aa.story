Tragedy: American stage hypnotist Scott Lewis fell to his death from an apartment block in Sydney, Australia

An American stage hypnotist has plunged to his death from a Sydney apartment building while on tour with a group of illusionists.

Scott Lewis, part of the Illusionists 2.0 magic troupe,  was found dead on a fourth floor balcony after reportedly falling from at least six floors above.

Sydney police said today there were no immediate suspicions about the death and they were investigating reports that Dr Lewis fell when he was climbing from one balcony to another.

Witnesses reported seeing an object falling up to six storeys at the Goldsborough Mort apartments in Pyrmont Street.

Police
 and ambulance crews who raced to the apartment block near Darling 
Harbour were unable to save Dr Lewis who had suffered massive injuries.

Tourist Rachael Waack, who is staying 
at the apartment block, said she heard a 'whoomp' noise just after 9am 
before a woman began screaming hysterically.

She
 told the Sydney Telegraph: 'I went out to the walkway outside our 
apartment and saw a woman walking along with her head in her hands, 
screaming.

'She was saying "do they know?, do they know? Then we saw the police arrive soon after that.'

The
 50-year-old stage hypnotist was reported missing by other members of 
his troupe when he did not arrive to set off on the group's bus for an 
11 am matinee at the Sydney Opera House.

Dr
 Lewis is known in the US as the host of the longest-running hypnosis 
show in Las Vegas history.He has brought laughter and astonishment with 
his skilful hypnotism of members of the audience, ordering them while 
under a trance to perform outrageous acts.

Officially
 a clinical hypnotherapist, he has written a number of self-help books 
to help people, for example, to give up smoking and drinking.

His books have also been helpful in explaining to people how they can lose weight by using hypnosis.

He and the other travelling illusionists and magicians were booked for 13 shows at the Opera House, the final being on January 16.

The Opera House has issued a statement confirming it has been told of the death of Dr Lewis and expressing the management's sympathies to his family, friends and the other members of the show.

'Dr Scott was a wonderful performer,' said the Opera House, 'and he will be greatly missed.'

Tim Lawson, co-producer of the show, told Sydney's Daily Telegraph that it had been decided by the other members to continue with the tour in Dr Lewis's memory.

The next two performances, he said, would be specifically dedicated to the hypnotist.

As police continued their investigations into the death plunge it was believed they had established that Dr Lewis had fallen from an 11th floor balcony to the fourth floor balcony.

A report was last night being prepared for the coroner

The identity of the woman who was heard screaming and asking 'Do they know?' remained unknown last night.
