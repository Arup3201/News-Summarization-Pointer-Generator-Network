Victim: Dr. Michael Davidson has died after he was shot twice on Tuesday morning

The cardiologist shot twice  by a gunman at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday morning has died.

Dr. Michael Davidson was killed outside an examination room on the second floor of the Carl J. and Ruth Shapiro Cardiovascular Center.

Stephen Pasceri, 55, appeared to deliberately target heart surgeon Davidson after asked for the doctor at the desk of the world renowned hospital's heart unit before opening fire.

Davidson had treated the shooter's mother before she passed away in 2014.

'Dr. Davidson was a wonderful and inspiring cardiac surgeon who devoted his career to saving lives and improving the quality of life of every patient he cared for,' said a statement issued by the hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. 

'It is truly devastating that his own life was taken in this horrible manner.' 

Pasceri, who is married and has children, then turned the gun on himself in an examination room and ended his life.

He was licensed to carry a gun and police have said that his family had no idea he would ever have planned to commit murder. 

One of Pasceri's friends told WHDH that the family 'are in shock and say he was the nicest guy.'

His mother, Marguerite Pasceri, died on November 15, 2014 and was reportedly treated at one point by the cardiologist who is also an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.

Her obituary wrote that she 'died surrounded by the family she had loved so much in life. A light has gone from the world that can never be replaced.'

In the same obituary, it added that she will be deeply missed by her children, Stephen, Angela, Matthew, Andrew and Rebecca.

The Massachusetts Public Notices advisory states that Stephen Pasceri was also the executor of his mother’s will and estate.

The suspect entered Brigham and Women's Hospital, affiliated with Harvard Medical School, sometime before 11 a.m. Tuesday and requested the doctor by name, Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said.

Evans said police were on the scene at Brigham and Women's Hospital within seconds after getting the first calls about the shooting.

Officers conducting a room-by-room search found Pasceri dead from a self-inflicted wound in an examination room. His gun was also found.

Global reputation: Brigham and Women's in Boston is world renowned for its emergency surgeries and facial reconstructions

Boston police had at one stage mistakenly tweeted that Pasceri had been apprehended and was in custody.  

Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said that because the doctor was surrounded by colleagues medical help was administered immediately.

'We are looking at a possible motive. We know (the gunman) came into the hospital on the second floor looking for this particular doctor. There was a reason he targeted this doctor,' Evans said according to WMUR.Com.

'Our prayers go out to the doctor's wife,' Evans said. 

Police have said the situation was declared resolved at around 11.54am, but earlier there was a confusing situation.

'There has been a shooting in the Shapiro building, and the suspect has been apprehended. The Shapiro center has been locked down, and all staff are asked to remain in place,' the hospital said in a statement.

One witness said that the Shapiro building had been placed on lockdown and dozens of emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene.

'Once we were clear of the waiting room, there were police officers with their weapons drawn yelling, 'Get down! Get down,'' said one man to WCVB.

Hospital employees are well-drilled for the nightmare scenario of a shooter inside the building.

In November 2013, doctors and nurses and other staff at the world-famous institution underwent training for an active shooter situation and viewed a video for a so-called 'Code Silver' event.

'I am extremely proud of the way our staff responded,' said hospital president Dr. Elizabeth Nabel according to the Boston Globe.
