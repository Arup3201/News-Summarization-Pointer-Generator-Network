On course to become a world record breaker, 14-year-old Lee Norton can already stack and unstack cups faster than anyone else in Britain.

Lee, from Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, is the national sport stacking champion, a speed game in which competitors build plastic cups in a pyramid formation and take them down as fast as they can.

He has become an internet sensation, clocking up more than 500,000 hits on YouTube with his record attempts and tutorials.

Lee is so keen to work for the world title that his parents have to make him cut down on practice so he can finish his homework.

Record-breaking teenager: Lee Norton, 14, is Britain's champion at sport stacking, a speed game where competitors stack and unstack plastic cups

'It's weird thinking you are the fastest in England for something,' he said. 

'My friends at school find it amazing 
that I have the UK record but they just treat me normally because I 
don't always bring it up or anything.'

Determined to stay ahead of the game, he often competes online against other teenagers across the world, as far away as Japan.

His PE teacher at primary school introduced him to the sport when he was 11.

Full of concentration: Lee begins demonstrating his unusual skill on his custom made table

Quick as a flash: His hands move so fast that they become a blur

He asked for a set of his own for Christmas and spent hours each day practicing, and the hard work paid off.

Just two years later Lee was the UK record holder for the 3x3x3, 3x6x3 and cycle disciplines.

Lee, whose record for the 3x3x3 is just 1.9 seconds, said: 'When you get a good time all of a sudden you get an urge to go faster and it just makes it more unique, a lot of fun and addictive.'

The current world record for 3x3x3 is 1.5 seconds, held by American Chandler Miller.

Lee is on 2.1 seconds for the  3x6x3 and 6.1 seconds for the cycle discipline.

So he is aiming for the world record of 2.0 seconds for the   3x6x3 and 5.7 seconds for the cycle.

To record the split-second times sport stackers need to use custom tables like Lee's, which record the moment their hands leave the surface and stops a timer when they have finished the move and returned to the start.

Lee said the unusual sport is growing in popularity and estimated there are around one million stackers around the world.

Quick reactions: Lee has traveled to Germany and the U.S to compete on the international stage

He has competed in Germany and USA, usually accompanied by his supportive father Martin, 50, and mother Assumpta Norton, 50.

They have spent hundreds of pounds so far to help him realise his dream.

Martin said: 'To have a son who has got three British records in his sport is just amazing.'

Lee's talent also comes in handy when older sister Kara, 18, is entertaining guests who find it 'absolutely amazing'.

'My friends love that he is a British champ - he's my little party trick now,' she said. 

Last year Lee and the rest of the British team took second place in the international team relay event ahead of 19 other countries.

Sport stacking has grown at a steady pace since it was invented in the early 1980s.

In the UK there are about 5,000 sport stacking clubs and last year it was included in the Amateur Athletic Union's Junior Olympic Games.

Lee's next big challenge is securing 
the Individual All-Around Grand Champion title at the 2013 World Sport
Stacking Championships in Orlando, Florida, in April.

He rates his chances at about 50-50 - as all the world record holders are in his age division.

'I'm definitely hoping to get to the finals, though getting into the top three would be nice,' he said.
