Life-saving: Diagnosis has improved vastly since 1994, according to the study

Tens of thousands of lives have been saved since the 1990s because patients with high blood pressure have been diagnosed and treated more effectively, researchers claim.

A study found around 70,000 heart attacks and strokes were avoided in 2011, some of which would have been fatal.

If the current rate of improvement continues, the annual number of cardiovascular events avoided will be 120,000 by 2022.

Around 30 per cent of people in England have high blood pressure, the biggest risk factor for early death. But experts say increasing use of a wide range of effective drugs is paying off.

Using data from five Health Survey for England polls from 1994 to 2011, experts analysed trends in blood pressure treatment.

Professor Neil Poulter, one of the researchers from Imperial College London, said steady progress had resulted in around 70,000 cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes being prevented in 2011.

He added: ‘The 70,000 is an estimated one-year effect, whereby if 2011 practice had been applied in 1994 we estimate there would  have been about 70,000 fewer major cardiovascular events in 1994.

‘If we continue at the current linear rate of improvement, then by the year 2022 there’ll be about 50,000 fewer major events compared with 2011 as a result.

‘These estimates are the result of treating more people who need it, more effectively.’

High blood pressure, known as hypertension, is classified as more than 140/90 millimetres of mercury (mmHg). The first figure, systolic pressure, corresponds to the ‘surge’ of each heartbeat. The second, or diastolic, reading is the pressure during the rest between beats.

Hypertension patients are advised to eat less salt, lose weight, drink less alcohol, eat more fruit and vegetables and exercise more. Six million Britons take blood pressure drugs.

The study found blood pressure steadily improved between 1994 and 2011, with the average systolic reading falling by 5mmHg in men and 9mmHg in women.

Treatment rates doubled between 1994 and 2011, with 58 per cent of hypertensive adults receiving medication in 2011. Among those treated, the proportion of patients keeping blood pressure below 140/90mmHg almost doubled from 33 per cent in 1994 to 63 per cent in 2011.

‘Whereas once half the general 
population with high blood pressure were diagnosed, half of those 
detected treated, and half of those treated controlled, now management 
in England is better than the rule of two-thirds'

As a result, blood pressure levels have fallen 15mmHg since 1994 in adults receiving treatment, according to the study.

The data, published in journal The Lancet, suggests many patients benefit from high doses of one drug, or two or three combined, and that some classes of drugs work better for certain age groups. Study leader Emanuela Falaschetti said there was ‘cause for optimism’.

‘Whereas once ... half the general population with high blood pressure were diagnosed, half of those detected treated, and half of those treated controlled, now management in England is better than the rule of two-thirds,’ she added.

Richard McManus of Oxford University and Jonathan Mant of Cambridge University wrote in The Lancet: ‘After 50 years of treatment, it seems that the drugs are working.’

Like all drugs, the medication has side effects, including drowsiness, pain in the kidney area, a dry cough, light-headedness and a skin rash. But patients can be given an alternative if they have an adverse reaction.

The Stroke Association’s Dr Shamim Quadir said the study showed ‘great progress’, but added: ‘The rates of diagnosis, treatment, and control of raised blood pressure in England are still too low compared with other countries, such as Canada.’
