The tool was introduced to football to help referees keep players sticking to the rules, but David Luiz found a way to make vanishing spray disappear on Tuesday night.

PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was lining up for a free-kick against Chelsea on the right-hand edge of the penalty area in the Champions league clash, an angle not favourable for a shot at goal.

The official had marked the spot for the kick to be taken from, but former Blues defender Luiz, decided to scoop up the spray and move it to the side while Cuneyt Cakir was not looking. 

David Luiz decides he doesn't like the look of where the referee has marked out the free-kick

The former Chelsea man rubbed out the foam with his hand while Zlatan Ibrahimovic waited behind him

Luiz then rubbed the foam from his hand into a different position 

The Brazilian then pointed to the new position for the free-kick and Ibrahimovic promptly lined up his shot.

Perhaps Luiz was trying to make up for his poor defending for the game's opening goal.

Although playing in midfield, Luiz moved back into his area to mark Branislav Ivanovic but lost track of him just as his former team-mate rose highest to head past Salvatore Sirigu in the PSG goal. 

PSG, though, equalised with a headed goal of their own after the break. Edinson Cavani met Blaise Matuidi's cross to nod past Thibaut Courtois. 

The Brazilian defender points to where he thinks Ibrahimovic should now take the free-kick from
