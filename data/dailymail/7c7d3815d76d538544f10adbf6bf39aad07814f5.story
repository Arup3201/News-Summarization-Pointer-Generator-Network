Rachael Owhin, 23, raised nearly £11,000 in eight days after discovering she could not afford her tuition fees at Oxford University

An Oxford student who set up a fundraising page to raise money for her Masters degree has raised nearly £11,000 in eight days.

Rachael Owhin, from Brent, London, was ecstatic after receiving an offer to study a MSc in migration studies at the Oxford University in March.

But after she was turned down for a scholarship, the 23-year-old spent  three months worrying that her savings and bank loan would not cover the extortionate tuition fees - a staggering £18,110.

She had saved £6,000 herself, and her mother lent her £2,000, but she was still £10,000 short.

In an ambitious bid to raise enough money Miss Owhin, a law graduate at Sussex University, set up a profile on crowd-funding site Hubbub with the slogan ‘£10,000 in ten days’.

She used #Oxford10000 to generate interest on social media, and rewarded people who donated to her cause.

She promised that a £10 donation would get a public thank you on Twitter. Donors who gave £1,000 were rewarded with a formal invitation to a dinner at Wolfson College, Oxford.

The page received 197 donations in just eight days, and her total now stands at £10,916 - meaning she can afford the tuition fees.

One anonymous donor left £1,002 after seeing the campaign on Twitter. 

Her involvement as a mentor at the Powerlist Foundation - which provides career support for people from disadvantaged backgrounds - also led to a generous donation from Dragons Den star Piers Linney, who is one of the foundation’s trustees.

Miss Owhin, whose mother works for a charity which helps disadvantaged children in the UK and Africa fund their education, said: ‘Going to Oxford is the fulfilment of all my dreams.

‘When they sent me the offer, they told me to apply for a scholarship for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. 

'I thought I had a good chance of getting the scholarship but in June I found out I didn’t. I went to the toilet and cried - my dream became a nightmare.

Using the Twitter hashtag #Oxford10000, Miss Owhin's crowd-funding page was inundated with donations

‘I had looked at crowd-funding, but I thought it was so ineffective. I needed serious money.

‘I did some research and decided that with the right social media campaign it was worth setting up a site. My sister came up with the hashtag idea in the shower. 

'On the first day, one of my Tweets got over 700 retweets - thank god for Twitter. It’s amazing to see how social media can be used for good.’

Miss Owhin added: ‘Oxford had no way to help. I’ve called them so often and numerous times they’ve told me to just apply next year. That’s such a horrible thing to say, to have only one option.

‘There’s nothing in place to support minority students that can’t afford the course. The tuition fees are a huge burden for someone who isn’t wealthy.

'£18,000, not to mention living costs, is extortionate. Most people can’t afford that.’

Miss Owhin will have to pay a total of £18,000 for her MSc in migration studies at Oxford, which starts soon

An Oxford University spokesman said: ‘Fundraising for postgraduate scholarships is one of the University’s key priorities and this year over 1,000 fully-funded scholarships were available from the University, its colleges and supporters for new master’s and doctoral students in 2014-15.

‘But for the many aspiring graduate students who do not receive scholarships, it can be very difficult to find the money for their studies and we hope that more can be done at a national level to ensure postgraduate study is open to all.’

Other students hoping to complete a masters degree at Oxford have also had to turn to crowd-funding.

Emily-Rose Eastop raised over £26,000 on Hubbub in July so she could study a MSc in cognitive and evolutionary anthropology.

And Zu Barbie hopes to raise nearly £60,000 so she can complete a two-year MPhil in political theory.
