The coach of a girls' basketball team was arrested after allegedly punching a 17-year-old player in the face and 'throwing her to the ground'.

The girl told police that Fred Freeman, 47, verbally abused her after her team the Wisconsin Stealers lost a game in a tournament in Fishers, Indiana, U.S.

The teenager said Freeman punched her in the face and threw her to the ground, before putting his hands around her throat.

Witnesses said basketball coach Fred Freeman struck the 17-year-old girl after an argument broke out between her and a teammate

Officers from the Fishers Police Department tracked Freeman down at a local restaurant, where he was eating with the rest of the team after the basketball game at the Indiana Fieldhouse sports complex in Fishers.

The incident reportedly occurred when Freeman, of Hartford, Wisconsin, intervened in an argument between the 17-year-old girl and one of her Wisconsin Stealers teammates.

Witnesses told police that, instead of breaking up the argument, Freeman hit the 17-year-old and threw her to the ground.

Police found scratches and abrasions on the girl following the incident.

Officer Tom Weger of Fisher's Police Department told wishtv8.com: 'She reported that during a verbal altercation he (Freeman) punched her in the face, threw her to the ground, and got on top of her with his hands around her throat.'

He said Freeman admitted 'restraining' the girl, but maintained that he was the victim.

Freeman was arrested on a preliminary charge of battery on Monday, but was later released and will not be formally charged.

Officials at the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office, Indiana, cited conflicting witness statements.

The Wisconsin Stealers are understood to have withdrawn early from the tournament, which was due to run until Wednesday, following the incident.

The tournament was arranged to give promising young basketball players the opportunity to impress college scouts.
