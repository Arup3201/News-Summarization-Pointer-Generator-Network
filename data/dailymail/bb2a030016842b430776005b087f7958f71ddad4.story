Her face has become the symbol of a year of protests that stretched from downtown Manhattan to Cairo's Tahrir Square. 

After being featured on the cover of TIME magazine as 'person of the year', it was only a matter of time before the identity of the Protester was revealed.

Sarah Mason, 25, has had fame thrust upon her after her image at an Occupy LA protest ended up on the front page.

Unmasked: TIME magazine used the image of Sarah Mason, a 25-year-old protester at Occupy LA, for its cover of the year

Her distinctive yellow bobble hat, defiant glare and 99% scarf stood out to photographer Ted Soqui who snapped the picture for LA Weekly. It was transformed into the artistic cover by LA street artist Shepard Fairey.

Miss Mason, who has gone completely underground since the cover emerged, was pictured linking  arms in a circle during a protest at the Bank of America Plaza on November 17.

She was arrested by riot police at the end of the day for failing to leave the square. 

The young woman, who works in an art gallery, had soaked her bandana in vinegar 'just in case the police sprayed them with gas or pepper spray', according to LA Weekly.

Miss Mason was pictured on an international day of action for the Occupy movement.

On the same day in New York, more than a thousand protesters gathered near the New York Stock Exchange chanting 'All day, all week, shut down Wall Street'.

Several thousands more crammed into Manhattan's Foley Square and marched to the Brooklyn Bridge.

Sarah Mason became involved in Occupy LA after struggling with her own personal debt when she left Northern Arizona University.

She
told 360 magazine: 'I think the Occupy Wall Street Movement has shown 
that a lot of attention has been going to the fact that students have 
made an investment in their educations, then they come to the real world
and they realize that that investment is essentially worthless.'

Occupy LA was cleared two weeks after NYPD evicted protesters from Zuccotti Park in Manhattan.

More than 200 people were arrested at the camp in California as 1,000 riot police stormed the site and cleared the tents.

The runner-up for the distinction of Time's person of the year included Admiral William H. McRaven, who organised the Navy SEALS raid that led to Osama bin Laden’s death in May.

Also considered were Chinese conceptual artist Ali Wei Wei, Wisconsin Rep Paul Ryan and Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton.

An online poll by the Today Show showed overwhelming support for former Apple honcho Steve Jobs and Rep Gabrielle Giffords.
