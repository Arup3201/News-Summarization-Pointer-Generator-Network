Ralph Smith was given £150,000 by a Malaysian woman he met on a dating website who turned out to be a suspected terrorist

A pensioner was given £150,000 by a Malaysian woman he met on a dating website who turned out to be a suspected terrorist laundering money, a court heard.

Ralph Smith, 61, of Biscovey, Cornwall, signed up for the over-50s site after splitting with his wife and soon became besotted with mother-of-two Lilian Alves.

During the next few months the pair expressed their 'undying love' for one another before Alves asked Mr Smith for his bank details.

But unlike typical internet dating scams where victims find their savings raided, Mr Smith was amazed to find an extra £150,000 sitting in his account.

Alves, claiming to be an affluent businesswoman in her early 60s, told disabled Mr Smith she needed her money in the UK so she could pay her European employees.

Mr Smith agreed to wire the money on to a series of individuals but his bank refused to transfer the funds.

The cyber romance came to an abrupt halt last September when Alves broke off contact ahead of a promised visit to the UK.

Instead, Mr Smith was arrested by detectives who showed up at his home investigating the theft of £600,000 from a bank account in Guernsey.

Detectives said the money was stolen by hackers who wired it to Asia then sent a chunk to Mr Smith's account.

He was suspected of acting as a 'money mule' for the gang who would likely use the cash to fundorganised crime or terrorism.

But when shocked Mr Smith, appeared at Truro Crown Court the prosecution offered no evidence because they accepted he was an innocent victim.

The court heard whoever was pretending to be Alves had picked identical interests to lure him in before exchanging emails for months.

Prosecutor Elaine Hobson said a charge of converting £150,000 of criminal property between August 28 and September 1, 2013 had been dropped.

He said: 'He has been duped - that is the view the Crown takes.'

Entering a formal verdict of not guilty on Ralph’s behalf, Judge Christopher Harvey Clark QC said:

'The prosecution took the very reasonable view that enough is enough.

'You leave the dock an innocent man, no doubt a wiser man.'

Devon and Cornwall Police have not been able to unmask Alves or establish exactly what was planned with the funds, £500,000 of which are still missing.

But Detective Constable Martin Skinner of the force’s Financial Investigation Unit said the complex scam showed how innocent singletons like Ralph can fall prey to cyber conmen.

He said: 'Alves had basically expressed her undying love for him to gain his trust.

'She then concocted a story suggesting that she wanted to come over and visit Mr Smith but she had to pay some employees who were working in Europe who would only trust a UK bank account.

'Mr Smith was subsequently charged with criminal offences due to not reporting the incident to police immediately.

Det Con Skinner said the gang set up their profile specifically to seduce Mr Smith.

He added: 'They basically did the work of the dating agency. They set up a profile for the exact sort of woman who would match Mr Smith’s requirements.

'Alves appeared affluent, well presented, she had photos taken abroad in the U.S. and Canada. She even had supposed links to Biscovey.

'It was very convincing but in reality all a load of rubbish.

'This can happen to anyone. It’s a message we need to get across to the public - don’t trust anyone when there are finances involved; always double-check; never give your bank details out.'

Mr Smith, who can no longer work because of his disability, has since got back together with his wife.

He has never been in trouble with the police before and says he had no idea the woman he fell in love with was a fraudster.

Mr Smith said: 'I had absolutely no idea, never even gave it a thought that it was a crime. I was unaware of crime going on like that.

'My warning is to other people to please go careful online, who they talk to and who they trust because it happened to me and it happened so easily.

'I would just like it not to happen to somebody else, to have to go through what I’ve been through.'
