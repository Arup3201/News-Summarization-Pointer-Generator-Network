Thai police have seized more than 3,000kg of marijuana which was packed up in hundreds of boxes destined for the UK.

The packages - worth a total of Â£1million - were ready to be sent to haulage firm CKR Services' warehouse address in Galleon Boulevard, Dartford, Kent.

The firm told MailOnline it had 'nothing to do with the illegal drug trade and was appalled that the stickers were addressed to its warehouse'.

Arrest: Thai police held a press conference following the detention of a suspect

Nipon Mopad, 43, was arrested 
today when the record haul - believed to be part of the country's biggest ever 
drugs bust - was discovered in a house in the central Thai province of 
Saraburi.

The suspect reportedly told police he was hired by a man, known as Mr Toss, to pack the drug.

He was then, he said, going to deliver the packages to another man named Mr Tong.

U.S. and United Nations drug experts believe most marijuana in Thailand originates in neighbouring Laos, where law enforcement is more lax.
