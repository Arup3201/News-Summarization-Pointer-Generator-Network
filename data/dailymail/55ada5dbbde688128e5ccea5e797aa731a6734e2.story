The latest temporary pavilion for London's Serpentine Gallery was unveiled today, resembling a huge white climbing frame.

Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto is the 13th designer to create a new structure for the art venue gallery.

The steel lattice, constructed in London's Kensington Gardens, looks like it is built from a huge set of the spacers used for tiling, although it is actually made up of three-quarter-inch poles.

Fujimoto talked about how the new structure was designed to be 'cloud-like' as he unveiled his plans when he landed the commission for the annual architecture challenge earlier this year.

The building will stay up for four months. Previous designers have included Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and architect Zaha Hadid.

At aged 41, Fujimoto is the youngest architect to accept the invitation to design a temporary structure for the Serpentine Gallery.

Sou Fujimoto is the 'leading light of an exciting generation of artists who are re-inventing our relationship with the built environment,' according to a gallery statement.

Occupying some 357 square-meters of lawn in front of the Serpentine Gallery, 41-year-old Fujimoto's structure of 20mm steel poles features a cafe and visitors will be encouraged to enter and interact with the piece in different ways

The first visitors explored the various ways they could interact with the piece, which will be installed at the gallery for four months

'Inspired by organic structures, such as the forest, the nest and the cave, Fujimoto's signature buildings inhabit a space between nature and the the artificial.'

The majority of Fujimoto's buildings are in Japan, with commissions ranging from the domestic, such as Final Wooden House, T House and House N, to the institutions such as the Musashino Art Museum and Library at Musashino Art University.

Occupying 350 square-metres of lawn in front of the gallery, 'Fujimoto's delicate, latticed structure of 20mm steel poles will have a lightweight and semi-transparent appearance that will allow it to blend, cloud-like, into the landscape and against the classical backdrop of the gallery's colonnaded East wing' the centre says.

It's almost impossible to grasp the shape of the installation since it looks so different from every angle, and can hold a large number of people

It is designed as a 'flexible, multi-purpose social space - with a caf√© sited inside'.

Visitors will be encouraged to enter and interact with the Pavilion in different ways throughout its four-month tenure in London's Kensington Gardens.

Gallery Director Julia Peyton-Jones, and Hans Ulrich Obrist, Co-Director, said they were 'thrilled to be working with one of the most fascinating architects in the world today'.

They described Fujimoto as a 'visionary, who has conceived an extraordinary response to our invitation to design the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion'.

Describing his design concept, Sou Fujimoto, quoted by the gallery, said: 'For the 2013 Pavilion I propose an architectural landscape: a transparent terrain that encourages people to interact with and explore the site in diverse ways.

Looking pleased, Fujimoto couldn't have hoped for better weather for the launch of his vast and mesmerising structure

Smiling for the cameras: Fujimoto has been described as a 'leading light of an exciting generation of artists who are re-inventing our relationship with the built environment.'

The installation is said to resemble a giant version of the old favourite kids' game, KerPlunk

'Within the pastoral context of Kensington Gardens, I envisage the vivid greenery of the surrounding plant life woven together with a constructed geometry.

'A new form of environment will be created, where the natural and the man-made merge; not solely architectural nor solely natural, but a unique meeting of the two.'

Fujimoto is the third Japanese architect to accept the invitation to design the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion, following Toyo Ito in 2002 and Kazuyo Sejima & Ryue Nishizawa of SANAA in 2009
