A 13-month old baby who was on the brink of death when his heart stopped for nine minutes is making a miraculous recovery at home with his family.

Tiny Bobby Hutley was struck down with a deadly strain of bacterial meningitis in February and was rushed to hospital.

His condition then dramatically deteriorated and his terrified parents, Glen, 25, and Stacie, 24, could only watch as medics gave their little boy CPR.

Recovery: Bobby Hutley was close to death when he contracted bacterial meningitis and his heart stopped for nine minutes

Miraculously, Bobby's heart restarted and he pulled through.

The critically ill infant spent 12 days in intensive care and another two weeks in hospital before finally being allowed home on May 21.

Courageous Bobby is now going from strength to strength after winning his bitter fight for life.

And grateful Glen and Stacie, of Thetford, Norfolk, are now setting out to raise money for Meningitis UK to thank the charity for their help and support during their traumatic ordeal.

Glen, his father, said: 'We call Bobby our miracle little boy, and we want to do our best for the charity that helped us.'

He said Bobby fell ill in February and was taken by Stacie to see their GP. She was told he had a chest infection and and they should give him plenty of fluids.

But Bobby's condition steadily worsened and he developed a persistent rash.

His worried parents took him to the A&E unit at West Suffolk hospital, Bury St Edmunds, where he was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis disease.

Bobby was immediately transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge.

'The feeling of anxiety was absolutely horrific, it was a horrendous time,' said Glen.

The devastated Hutleys feared they were going to lose their only child when Bobby's heart suddenly stopped.

Remarkable: Bobby's parents Glen, 25, and Stacie, 24, say their only child has little scarring and his awareness is fantastic

'I thought if they do bring him round, what is going to happen from there? What quality of life is he going to have?

'But it is a true miracle that he is walking again now and his awareness is fantastic,' said Glen.

'People look at him and they don't suspect that he has had meningitis because all he has been left with is minor scarring.'

Stacey said since Bobby is doing really well and has had a string of hospital and follow-up appointments to monitor his progress.

The sales assistant said: 'It took him a while to come back to his former self.

'When he first came out of hospital he was like a newborn baby, he could not even hold his head up.

'But now Bobby's walking and talking and he is doing really well.

'He has had a few problems with his left eye, he has a bit of a lazy eye, but he has not had to go to hospital about it.'

Stacey spoke of her shock when Bobby was confirmed to have meningitis.

'Bobby was a well, happy boy and I did not see anything like that coming and it seriously affected our whole family,' she said.

Stacey praised her family for their backing throughout that nightmare time as well as saluting Meningitis UK.

'It was nice to know that their support was there as an option if we wanted to talk about it,~ she said.

'It is very difficult to speak to somebody who has not been through the experience, so it is nice to be able to share your thoughts and feelings with somebody who had.'

The Hutleys are to hold a ball at Sprowston Manor Hotel in Norwich on October 26 to raise money for Meningitis UK.
