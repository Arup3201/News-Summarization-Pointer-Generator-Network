Rather than just relying on expensive make-up and good lighting, A-list celebrities are trying out extreme procedures in their search for unblemished, wrinkle-free skin. 

In order to maintain his youthful glow, One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles reportedly goes books in for £325 sheep placenta facials at Dr Harold Lancer’s Beverly Hills clinic in LA.

Hollywood dermatologist and 'aesthetician’ Louise Deschamps told Grazia the 21-year-old pop star comes to see her for the 90-minute treatment every six weeks.

One Direction star Harry Styles is said to be a fan of £325 sheep placenta facials 

She told the magazine: ‘He gets all clogged up - putting on make-up all the time and travelling a lot plays havoc with his skin. 

'He takes care of himself and loves the facials, he likes to look good and have good skin.’

MailOnline has contacted Harry's representatives for a comment.  

The unusual treatment involves taking the placenta from prime New Zealand livestock - the stem cells, which are full of rich nutrients that fight free-radical skin damage, are extracted and then flash frozen.

They are then mixed into a gel containing gold flecks which are slathered over the face after it has been exfoliated, exposed to steam and had pores opened by LED light from a handheld device.

While it may sound like an intense treatment, the curly-haired star isn't the first to try out an experimental facial. 

Reality star Kim Kardashian tried out the vampire facial, which claims to boost collagen levels 

Reality star Kim Kardashian hit the headlines in 2013 after posting a picture on Twitter of her face covered in blood. 

The 34-year-old had undergone a £600 vampire facial, which involves using the patient's own blood to make improvements to the skin. 

Blood is draw out of the arm using a needle before being spun in a machine to remove the platelets. 

Blood is splattered onto the patient's face using acupuncture-style needles 

The remaining fluid is then splattered into the face using tiny acupuncture-style needles. 

The platelets are said to help stimulate collagen levels and elastin growth.  

Kanye West's wife revealed: 'I love trying anything that makes you look and feel youthful.' 

Other advocates of the therapy include British actress Anna Friel, Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Atomic Kitten star Kerry Katona. 

Another facial which isn't as frightful but is as equally as gruesome is the bird poo mask.

This therapy involves mixing excrement from a nightingale, collected from the Japanese island of Kyushu, with rice bran and water which is then applied as a face mask.

Tom Cruise, 52, is said to be a fan with insiders telling Now magazine: 'Tom doesn’t go in for Botox or surgery but he does pay close attention to all the new natural treatments.'

'He recently started experimenting with the nightingale poo facial after it was recommended by a Hollywood pal and the results have been fantastic.'

The nightgale poo is said to act as an exfoliant which unclogs pores and aids shine.

Victoria and David Beckham have reportedly given the £135 treatment a go too, as has Tom's ex wife Katie Holmes. 

Stepping away from bodily fluids, Sports Illustrated's Bar Refaeli maintains her supermodel glow with the the help of liquid gold. 

Leonardo DiCaprio's ex posted an picture of herself having the shimmery goo doused on her flawless face on her Twitter page.

The Caviar and Carat facial was created by aesthetician Bella Schneider. 

It helps uneven pigmentation, inflammation and bacteria, and improves elasticity.

It isn't as expensive as the name would suggest, coming in at £125 at Schneider's LaBelle Day Spas & Salons in California.

The facial relies on caviar ampule, honey, sea buckthorn, and gold to help combat the signs of aging and to brighten the skin. 

Jupiter Ascending actress Mila Kunis, 31, has followed Bar's lead, deciding to fight the signs of ageing with expensive jewels.  

Ashton Kutcher's partner Mila Kunis has forked out £4,200 for diamond and ruby facials 

Accorfing to reports, Ashton Kutcher's partner booked in for a £4,200 diamond and ruby facial before the Golden Globes in 2014. 

Mila had the HD Diamond and Ruby Peel devised by aesthetican Scott-Vincent Borba. 

The procedure involves precious stones being rubbed over her skin. 

The jewels are said to act as antioxidants and leave the patient with a 'lustrous sheen'. 

Someone who is never afraid to try out the latest health and beauty fad is Gwyneth Paltrow.

Gwyneth Paltrow banishes unwanted wrinkles with Thermage - nicknamed 'the ironing treatment'

Chris Martin's ex wife, who runs the lifestyle blog Goop, wards off unwanted wrinkles with the help of Thermage - dubbed 'the ironing treatment'.

The aim of Thermage, which will set you back £3,200, is to boost the levels of the collagen in the lower layers of the skin to create a tightening effect.

It doesn't sound like the most relaxing of facials, with the 42-year-old admitting it's like 'being smacked in the face'.  

Unlike lasers and tools such as the Dermaroller (a roller with lots of little needles on it), Thermage aims only to 'damage' the lower levels of the skin, and not the top level, which it does by using radio waves that trigger the collagen production. 

Amanda Holden and Linda Evangelista are also reportedly fans of the non-invasive treatment.
