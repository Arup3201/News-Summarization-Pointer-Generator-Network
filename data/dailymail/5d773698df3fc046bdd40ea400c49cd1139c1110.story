Faced with months of roadworks and a 14-mile diversion around a busy commuter route, most of us would simply resign ourselves to an earlier start to the working day.

But businessman Mike Watts had different ideas. After experiencing the upheaval caused by a road closure in Somerset, he rented a nearby field – and became the first private individual to build a British toll road in more than a century.

Mr Watts spent £150,000 building the unofficial road next to the A431, where a small section had been cordoned off after a landslip – leaving thousands with a 14-mile detour through country lanes.

That'll
 be £2 please, sir: A driver pays up to avoid a 10-mile detour on the A4
 although the local council do not approve of the road which cuts 
through an unused field

The new 
route, which has not yet received planning permission, opened on Friday 
and bypasses the closed section of road. Now for a payment of £2 each 
way, motorists can avoid driving on the hour-long diversion, and instead
 travel 400 yards along freshly laid tarmac.

Speaking
 next to his road in Kelston, Somerset, 62-year-old Mr Watts said: ‘I 
have had a 100 per cent positive response from the public on this. Too 
many people are displaced by the road closure.

‘Their
 daily lives have been so disrupted. I think people are very grateful 
that we have taken the risk. It’s not easy to build your own toll road, 
but we got there in the end.’

The A431 between Bristol and Bath was closed in February after a landslip caused cracks to appear in the road.

Mike Watts's toll road will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with toll operators there all the time

Businesses
 in the area soon began to suffer – including the cafe and party 
supplies shop Mr Watts runs with his 52-year-old wife Wendy in Bath.

‘It
 used to just be a very quick drive for us to Bath, but we were having 
to do a 14-mile detour which was taking up to an hour down tiny lanes 
just not designed to take the traffic,’ Mr Watts explained.

He
 asked landowner John Dinham for permission to rent the field until 
Christmas and hired three workmen to build the road in just ten days.

His
 bill came to £150,000, but Mr Watts believes the road will cost him a 
further £150,000 in upkeep costs, including the salaries of two 
24-hour-a-day toll booth operators.

However the father of four is confident he will recoup his investment before the council’s road opens in December.

The Kelston toll road has been opened by local businessman Mike Watts, 62, who was fed up of an hour long detour caused by roadworks after just a few hundred yards of highway was cordoned off thanks to a landslip

Mike Watts, 62, built a private toll road in Somerset after the A431 Kelston Road - a popular commuter route -was shut in February following a landslip

‘We’ve
 got to reach £300,000, that works out at 30,000 cars between now and 
Christmas just to break even,’ he said, adding: ‘If we cover our costs 
we’ll be very happy indeed.’

Mr Watts has now applied for retrospective permission for the 22ft-wide road.

He
 has also taken out public liability insurance and officers from Bath 
and North East Somerset Council and the Health and Safety Executive have
 inspected the site to make sure it is on stable ground.

Local
 mother of two Laura Fenton, 28, said she was delighted with the road, 
adding: ‘It was difficult getting kids around. If I wanted to take them 
to a doctor’s appointment in Bath it was a huge diversion.

'I think what 
Mike and the farmer have done is brilliant. It has already helped a lot 
of people and I can see us using it a lot.’

But
 a council spokesman said: ‘While we appreciate the difficulties 
residents have experienced, it’s not just the planning, it’s the safety 
and legal aspect of drivers using the road.’ He added: ‘Work has started
 to deliver a solution as quickly as possible.’
