Ashley Judd just wanted to watch her University of Kentucky Wildcats play some basketball. Instead, the actress had to endure the advances of ESPN announcer Dick Vitale.

Before Sunday's SEC Championship game between the Wildcats and Arkansas, Vitale was pictured leaning in to kiss Judd smack dab on the lips while she leaned away, her face in a tortured expression.

Thankfully, the game wasn't all bad for Judd. The Wildcats went on to beat the Razorbacks 78-63, a good omen for their chances in the NCAA Tournament, which starts on Thursday.

On Sunday, the NCAA Tournament bracket was announced. Kentucky is the favorite to win it all. Duke, Wisconsin and Villanova are the other No. 1 seeds.  

Too close: ESPN announcer Dick Vitale kissed actress Ashley Judd on the lips during Sunday's SEC Championship game between Kentucky and Arkansas 

Judd spent most of her childhood in Kentucky, and attended the University of Kentucky where she majored in French and was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. 

The school is currently chasing history,  trying to become the first undefeated champion in March Madness since Indiana in 1976. 

The Wildcats are seeded first overall in the tournament and tops in the Midwest Region, in search of six more wins for a perfect season.

The other No. 1 seeds are Villanova in the East, Duke in the South and Wisconsin in the West. The Badgers (31-3) secured the first top seed in program history after overcoming an 11-point deficit Sunday against Michigan State to win 80-69 in overtime.

The No. 2 seeds are Kansas in the Midwest, Virginia in the East, Gonzaga in the South and Arizona in the West.

The Wildcats will open Thursday against the winner of Tuesday's play-in game between No. 16 seeds Manhattan and Hampton.

Another play-in game will match No. 11 seeds Boise State against Dayton, both of which were at-large bubble teams.

Other teams that made it off the bubble included UCLA and Texas, both given No. 11 seeds and not forced to play in a play-in game. BYU and Mississippi also made it as No. 11 seeds and will meet in a play-in game.

Colorado State, Temple, Old Dominion and Miami were among those left out. CSU and Temple both had RPIs more than 20 points better than Ole Miss.

The Big 12 and Big Ten led the way by placing seven teams each in the bracket.

March madness: the NCAA tournament starts Thursday. University of Kentucky, Villanova, the University of Wisconsin and Duke are the four top-seeded teams
