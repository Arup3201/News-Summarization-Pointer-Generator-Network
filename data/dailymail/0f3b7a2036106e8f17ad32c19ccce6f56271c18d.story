Ray Lee, 65, says his life was saved by an ambulance driving over a pothole as it slowed his heart rate

They are an everyday hazard which leave most of us cursing.

But the pothole that punctuated Ray Lee’s journey may well have saved his life.

The grandfather was on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance being taken to hospital after collapsing at home while exercising on a cross-trainer.

He had suffered a suspected ventricular tachycardia attack – a potentially fatal heart rhythm.

His heart rate soared to 190 beats per minute, causing crippling pains in his chest.

The medical solution when he reached Salisbury District Hospital would have been to give him an injection to stop his heart before restarting it with a shock.

But, thanks to a poorly-maintained road on the five-mile trip from his home in Wilton, Wiltshire, Mr Lee didn’t have to wait.

The ambulance hit a pothole, throwing the retired operations manager up off his stretcher.

When he landed, his heart had reset itself to a healthy 60bpm.

His wife, Christine, called an ambulance when Mr Lee’s heart rate shot up during his exercise routine.

‘The paramedics gave me an injection and strapped me to an ECG machine, which showed my heart was going at 186 beats per minute,’ said Mr Lee, 65.

‘We raced along the roads at high speed, with a medic standing in the back, leaning over me.

‘All of a sudden, there was a massive bang as we smacked into a pothole and the whole ambulance jolted.  Everyone on board jumped and I was lifted off the stretcher, before falling back into place.

‘After a few seconds I readjusted myself, settled back down, and looked over at the monitor to see my heart rate had plummeted to 60bpm.

The jolt that the dip in the road caused Mr Lee's heart rate to drop dramatically while he was being rushed to hospital. He said he has complained about the state of his road for years but now doesn't want the potholes to ever be filled in

‘The paramedic looked at me in a state of disbelief, but nobody said anything because we were so focused on getting to hospital.’

When they arrived, Mr Lee was still in pain and given morphine – and medics decided the jolt had saved him having to have the planned treatment.

‘I felt a bit of a fraud by the time I got to A&E, because my heart rhythm was normal,’ he said.

‘I was told they would have carried out a procedure to stop the spasm in my heart, but driving over the pothole did the trick.’

Potholes may ruin cars and be unsightly but in Mr Lee's case it helped save his life

Mr Lee and his wife, a retired teacher, drive along the same road regularly and have previously cursed its bad state.

He said the stretch of road, which has a mixture of 30mph and 60mph speed limits, has numerous potholes, some of which are 2ft wide and a couple of inches deep.

Mr Lee said: ‘I’d been cursing the council for months about the state of the roads because I spend my life dodging potholes, but now I never want them to fill in another pothole again.

‘I can’t say the pothole alone saved me – the wonderful paramedics and doctors did that – but bumping over it did make things easier.

‘Without the appalling condition of Wiltshire Council’s roads I might not have had such an easy time.

‘I guess there are some potholes that ruin your car and others that save your life.’

The grandfather-of-three was told that what he suffered had created a form of electrical short circuit in his heart, possibly as a result of a heart attack 21 years ago.

Mr Lee, who spent three days in hospital, is now undergoing tests, and has been told to take it easy.

But he says he feels well and is thanking his ‘pot luck’.

A spokesman for South Western Ambulance Service said: ‘We can confirm we were carrying a patient to hospital with a heart condition when the ambulance hit a pothole.

'The patient’s heart rate subsequently fell.’
