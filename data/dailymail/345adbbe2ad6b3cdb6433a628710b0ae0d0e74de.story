Once again, the Aviva Premiership delivered high drama on Saturday as champions Northampton were beaten at Sale, Bath crushed Wasps to move to within a point of the Saints at the top of the table and Harlequins claimed a bonus-point home win against Leicester.

The matches, following Friday’s thunderous and damaging Gloucester-Saracens encounter at Kingsholm, also provided further pointers for England head coach Stuart Lancaster as he prepares to name a revised Test squad next week.

With the RBS 6 Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff looming on February 6, here is a run-down of the current selection issues…

Billy Vunipola is primed to reclaim his No 8 jersey for England's Six Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff 

Ben Morgan is likely to miss the entire Six Nations after the Gloucester forward broke a leg against Saracens 

Morgan was named England's player of the series after his superb display against Australia in November 

TIGHT-FIVE TUSSLE  

Alex Corbisiero is back in action for Northampton but he was in a beaten pack in Salford, not least in the scrum, and contributed to a team performance awash with basic handling errors. Joe Marler is on course to retain the No 1 shirt ahead of his Lions loosehead rival.

Tom Youngs of Leicester is the form hooker in the country — while rival Dylan Hartley has been serving a ban — but his fellow Tiger, Dan Cole, missed the defeat at Quins and is unlikely to have time to usurp Bath’s David Wilson at tighthead.

In the second row, with Courtney Lawes poised for an imminent Saints comeback, he and David Attwood, who reached a century of appearances for Bath against Wasps, are sure to continue their effective partnership, while Joe Launchbury continues his injury rehab.

Graham Kitchener maintained his fine form for Leicester in the tussle for the replacement lock role, after George Kruis was sin-binned for a dangerous tackle on Friday night.

Corbisiero, Rob Webber and Kieran Brookes are most likely to provide the front-row cover.

Mike Brown (Harlequins); Anthony Watson (Bath), Luther Burrell (Northampton), Brad Barritt (Saracens), Jonny May (Gloucester); George Ford (Bath), Danny Care (Harlequins); Joe Marler (Harlequins), Tom Youngs (Leicester), David Wilson (Bath); Dave Attwood (Bath), Courtney Lawes (Northampton); Tom Wood (Northampton), Chris Robshaw (capt, Harlequins), Billy Vunipola (Saracens)

BACK-ROW BLOW  

The savage blow to Ben Morgan, who had surgery on Saturday after breaking his left leg at Kingsholm the night before, means Billy Vunipola will return to England’s starting XV against Wales.

Quins’ win generated renewed calls for Nick Easter to be considered for a recall at the age of 36 after his latest supreme performance.

Easter said: ‘Clearly the door’s been pretty much shut for quite a while, but as long as you are playing, there is always an option. It is up to the selectors — sometimes your face fits, sometimes it doesn’t.’

Bath lock Dave Attwood looks set to continue his second row partnership with Courtney Lawes 

Unfortunately for Easter, it appears that his face doesn’t fit, despite his stellar form. As the summer approaches, Lancaster will consider bringing Steffon Armitage in from his French exile, and the coaches are bound to call up Nathan Hughes of Wasps when the mighty Fijian qualifies on residency next year.

Captain Chris Robshaw played well on his Quins comeback on Saturday and he is surely secure at openside, despite Matt Kvesic’s personal resurgence at Gloucester. Tom Wood deserves to keep the blindside berth and James Haskell can cover all bases from the bench.

HALF-BACK DUEL 

It was a setback for Saracens and England when Owen Farrell had to pull out of Friday’s game in the West Country with a tight calf. Club and country need him to string together a long run of matches at No 10.

However, England can take heart from George Ford’s sensational form at fly-half — with the master-class he produced against Wasps being the latest example. The Bath playmaker is riding the crest of a wave after his autumn exploits and he continues to find ways to carve open the best defences.

George Ford is England's form fly half at present and looks set to start against the Welsh in Cardiff 

While Freddie Burns is struggling to break into the Leicester team and revive his game, Danny Cipriani and Stephen Myler are vying for the final squad fly-half place. Cipriani won the duel between the pair on Saturday, partly thanks to his pack’s controlling influence but also because his distribution, decision-making and kicking were assured.

At scrum-half, Danny Care eclipsed Ben Youngs at The Stoop, but again he had his forwards to thank for creating the platform. Their battle for supremacy will go on and on.

OUTSIDE-BACK RACE 

The midfield conundrum never ends. Manu Tuilagi was again absent from Leicester’s line-up and he is likely to miss the start of the Six Nations, which is a major blow to Lancaster.

Kyle Eastmond was missing from the Bath side and while Sam Burgess excelled as his try-scoring deputy he will continue to learn a new code before the Test call-up inevitably comes.

Luther Burrell has impressed for the Saints in recent months and looks set to start at outside centre 

Luther Burrell was untidy and hesitant at Sale, but his form has been so good all season that it is fair to regard his display as a brief blip. On Friday, Billy Twelvetrees had one of those games that so infuriates the England coaches; classy one minute, sloppy and rash the next. It is hard to see him retaining his starting place at 12.

Brad Barritt is due back for Saracens next weekend and he will surely join forces with Burrell, although Jonathan Joseph and Henry Slade warrant consideration. Providing they are all fit, England are unlikely to find any reason to change their most recent back-three unit of Mike Brown, Anthony Watson and Jonny May.
