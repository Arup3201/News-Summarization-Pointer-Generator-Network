Two men have been charged with drugs offences following the death of 16-year-old Daniel Spargo-Mabbs from a suspected overdose.

Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, and Ryan Kirk, 20, from Beckenham, both in South London, are accused of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

They appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court today and are next due at Isleworth Crown Court on February 5.

The pair, along with another 
19-year-old man who has been bailed until March, were arrested after 
Daniel died from a suspected drugs overdose after going to an illegal 
rave.

It is believed the teenager fell unconscious after taking ecstasy at the party at an industrial site in Hayes, West London.

Paramedics were called at around 4am on Saturday and he was taken to hospital and put on life support, but died on Monday.

His father, who along with his wife is a devoted Christian, warned yesterday: ‘It could happen to anyone.’

Speaking at the family home in Croydon, Tim Spargo-Mabbs, 50, described his son as ‘a lovely, mercurial kid’.

He said: ‘He was up for adventure. He was a really normal kid. He spent a bunch of his spare time with his girlfriend and played a lot on his Xbox.

‘This was the first time he’d taken anything and if it could happen to him it could happen to anyone. We very much want to get that message across.’

Mr Spargo-Mabbs added that Daniel’s girlfriend, a fellow pupil at Archbishop Tenison’s Church of England High School in Croydon, was ‘traumatised’ by his death.

Final words: The schoolboy, pictured left, told his mother, pictured right, 'I love you, I promise I won't die' as he left home on Friday night - just hours before he was taken to hospital suffering from a drugs overdose

His mother Fiona said she would always hug and kiss her two sons, Daniel and his brother Jacob, before they left the house.

She
 told reporters: ‘Danny always used to say, “I love you too mum, I 
promise I won’t die”. And that’s exactly what he said when he went out 
on Friday.’

They were the 
last words he ever said to her. The next time his parents saw him he was
 in intensive care after taking ecstasy for the first time at an illegal
 rave. 

The 16-year-old had suffered a massive heart attack and died two days later.

His
 Oxford-educated mother Fiona, 46, who works as a manager in adult 
education at Croydon Council, said Daniel had never taken drugs before 
and had been lectured by his parents and school about the scourge of 
ecstasy.

On Friday night 
the bright student, who attended Archbishop Tenison’s Church of England 
School in Croydon, which is known for its high academic standards, 
persuaded his mother to let him go to a party in Clapham, South London, 
saying: ‘Come on, Mum, I hardly ever go to parties and I am sensible and
 responsible.’

But instead of the party he went to an illegal rave on an industrial estate in Hayes, West London.

Aid: Daniel was taken to hospital on Saturday believed to be suffering from the effects of a drugs overdose

In a warehouse, owned
 by a commercial cleaning firm and said to be packed with 3,000 
revellers, his parents believe he experimented with ecstasy for the 
first time.

Shortly 
afterwards the youngster collapsed and was taken to hospital. His 
reaction to the drug sent his temperature rocketing to 42C (107.6F), 
causing a massive heart attack.

Mrs Spargo-Mabbs recalled how she had kissed her son goodbye for the last time hours before he took the substance.

‘A
 few years ago I heard a talk by murder victim Jimmy Mizen’s mum and she
 said that something that comforted her was that she had told Jimmy she 
loved him and had given him a hug and a kiss before he had left the 
house,’ she said.

Place of education: Daniel was a pupil at Archbishop Tenison's Church of England High School in Croydon

‘After that I always did the same 
with my boys and it became an in-joke. Danny always used to say “I love 
you too, Mum. I promise I won’t die.”

‘And that’s exactly what he said when he went out on Friday. He didn’t keep that promise.’

Speaking
 at the family’s home in Croydon, South London, which she shares with 
her husband Tim, 50, and son Jacob, 18, she added: ‘I  woke up early on 
Saturday morning and when I saw he wasn’t back I started to worry.

‘Then at about 5.30am there was a knock on the door. It was the police. It was completely my worst nightmare coming true.’

The
 family rushed to Hillingdon Hospital where Daniel was in intensive 
care. He was transferred to a specialist liver unit at King’s College 
Hospital for emergency surgery but he died on Monday.

'We grieve together': Daniel was praised by his headteacher as a 'bright, articulate and talented' boy

Deaths involving ecstasy have increased almost four-fold in recent years.

In 2012 there were 31 deaths linked to the class A drug, up from eight in 2010.

There
 was also a large increase in the number of death certificates 
mentioning PMA or PMMA, strong psychedelic stimulants usually found in 
ecstasy pills.

The 
substances, which can cause severe overheating of the body, were linked 
to only one death in 2011, but in 2012 they were involved in 20 
fatalities.

Campaigners believe many people may be ingesting PMA or PMMA in the belief they are taking ecstasy tablets.

According
 to government estimates, around 2.8million Britons have tried ecstasy 
at least once and 179,000 people take it at least once a month.

It is usually sold as tablets but the powder form, MDMA, has become more common.
