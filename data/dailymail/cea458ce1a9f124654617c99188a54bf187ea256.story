It is the spot where Bram Stoker dreamt up Dracula’s bloodthirsty tale. 

Gazing at Whitby’s rugged coastline and ruined Abbey, the Irish writer here felt inspired to pen his 1897 Gothic novel.

But now health and safety officials have killed off the dramatic view by driving a number of wooden stakes through it – to erect a fence directly in front of a commemorative bench.

Stoker visited Whitby in 1890 to decide whether it would be suitable for a family holiday.

But he was apparently so taken with the atmosphere of the seaside town – the red roofs, Whitby Abbey and the bats flying around the many churches –  that he used it as the setting for the book.

The North Yorkshire seaside town relies on its connection to Count Dracula to boost its tourist trade and the council’s decision to erect the 4ft barrier for ‘public safety’ has been widely condemned.

A plaque on the bench reads: ‘The view from this spot inspired Bram Stoker (1847-1912) to use Whitby as the setting of part of his world-famous novel Dracula.’

The move comes a month after safety barriers were erected on the sea wall, ruining the view from adjacent beach huts.

Harry Collett, chairman of Whitby and District Tourism Association, said: ‘I would like to know how many people have fallen off there since the 1830s.

'They seem to be going bonkers over this health and safety.’

The town’s Mayor John Freeman, added: ‘It’s a most unsightly structure.

'It’s horrendous, farmers would put a better fence up than that. It’s just hideous.’

A council spokesman said emergency work had been carried out following a recent collapse of a section of cliff.

She said public safety was of paramount importance.
