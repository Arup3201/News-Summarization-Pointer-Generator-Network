Andy Murray responded to an earsplitting welcome from his adoring Scottish crowd to put Great Britain 1-0 up in their Davis Cup first round against the United States.

In front of a packed 7,700 crowd at a Union Jack-bedecked Emirates Arena in Glasgow he recovered from a brief lull to eventually crush American number two Donald Young 6-1 6-1 4-6 6-2 in just under two hours.

The match was over quick enough for Murray to remain as the likely option to play in tomorrow’s doubles alongside brother Jamie in the event of the tie ending level today at 1-1.

'To play in front of this crowd is very special and I’m glad I managed to play a good match and get the win,' said Murray. 

'I played an extremely high level in the first two sets and it was tough to keep that intensity up. I had a slight lull in the middle of the third set and Donald settled down.'

After getting a deafening reception when he walked onto the court Murray needed to control his emotions sufficiently to concentrate on beating the world number 47 from Atlanta.

The pair knocked up in slightly surreal circumstances to the crowd singing along with Runrig’s ‘Loch Lomond’ and that seemed to inspire the former Wimbledon champion and unnerve the ex junior world number one.

Murray rattled through the first set, not dropping a point on serve as he took it in 21 minutes. He was equally unwavering in taking the second after just 47 minutes’ overall play with Young pressing too hard and making errors galore on the slow indoor court. 

The American lefthander found his range more in the third and when the Scot put in a poor game at the end of it was good enough to close it out.

To the delight of a partisan but well-behaved crowd he regained his focus in the fourth set and took it after another two breaks. His fist pumping celebration spoke of how much it meant to him.

British number two was up against the huge serving John Isner in the singles rubber that followed.
