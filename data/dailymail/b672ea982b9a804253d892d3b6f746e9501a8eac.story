This is the moment one of the survivors of a plane crash in Uruguay was winched to safety by rescue workers. Five of his fellow passengers died in the accident, while another three survived

The light aircraft ditched into the Rio de la Plata river as it was flying between Argentina and Uruguay in heavy fog. It is not known exactly what caused the accident, though it is thought to be engine failure

Among the five dead was Gustavo Fosco, communications director for Renault, Fernando Sanchez, a Renault press officer, and the pilot Leandro Larriera

The two other dead were confirmed by Spanish media as Facundo Alecha, chief of human resources at brewer Quilmes, and Fernando Lonigro, a senior manager at travel firm GTS.

Their bodies have been removed from the wreckage, but are being held by a judge in Uruguay pending further investigation.

The survivors are Sebastián Vivona, a sales manager at clothing chain Kosiuko, Paula Silvana Buery, an event organiser for GTS, Santiago Villamil, and Ignacio Javier Losa.

Ignacio Llosa, 34 , was taken to San Fernando Cordero hospital in Argentina after suffering cuts to his scalp, along with Santiago Villamil, 37, who fractured his left and right forearm. Both are in a stable condition.

The light aircraft took off from Buenos Aires at 12.20pm and was scheduled to arrive in Carmelo at 12.45, but at 1.50pm emergency services got a call from the survivors saying there had been a crash

Two of the injured were taken to hospital in Argentina and are now in a stable condition. Another, Paula Buery, was taken to hospital in Uruguay with multiple traumatic injuries

Paula Buery, 39, the only woman on board the aircraft, was taken to Colonia hospital in Uruguay with a hip fracture and multiple traumatic injuries.

Sebastian Vivona was also taken to hospital in Uruguay, thought his condition is not known.

The exact cause the crash, which occurred in heavy fog, 
is still unknown though Argentine Security Secretary Sergio Berni said experience suggested it was engine failure.

Speaking to Fox Latino, he added: 'Everything indicates that it hit nose first because of how the tail became detached.

'Certainly, it had a problem with the engine and because of the fog bank there [the pilot] couldn't see the river well when he tried to land.'

The crash happened over the Rio de la Plata as the plane was making its way between an airport in Buenos Aires and Carmelo in Uruguay

The bodies of all five victims have now been removed from the aircraft but are being held by a judge in Uruguay

The light aircraft, a Beech B-200 Super King Air, took off from Buenos Aires airport in Argentina at 12.20pm and was due to land in Carmelo airport in Uruguay at 12.45pm.

However search and rescue teams got an emergency call at 1.50pm from survivors saying there had been a crash, and when they arrived on the scene ten minutes later they found the crumpled wreckage floating in shallow water.

The plane is owned by Federico Bonomi, owner of Kosiuko, though he was not on board and is thought to be in America with his family.
