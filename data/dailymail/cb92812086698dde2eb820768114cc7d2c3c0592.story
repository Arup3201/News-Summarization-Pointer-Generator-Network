The Obama administration had a backup plan if the Osama bin Laden raid had failed and had drafted a ‘highly lawyered’ memo to protect President Obama from potential backlash, according to an official.

Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey told Fox News’ Sean Hannity today that Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta drafted a note that would have put the blame instead on Navy Admiral William McRaven.

At the time of the raid last May, Adm. McRavin was commander of Joint Special Operations Command.

Placing blame: Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, left, told Fox News' Sean Hannity, right, that now-Defence Secretary Leon Panetta drafted a note that would have put the blame on Navy Admiral William McRaven had the raid on Osama bin Laden failed

Talking points: Mr Mukasey also contrasted Obama with how Lincoln responded after Gen. Lee conceded

According to Mr Mukasey, the ‘highly lawyered’ memo from Mr Panetta ‘was to proceed according to the risks, only according to the risks that had been outlined to the president.’

Mukasey said the plan was to blame Admiral William McRaven if the raid failed

He told Hannity: ‘You better believe if anything else had been encountered and the mission had failed, then the blame would have fell on McRaven. That’s what this is about.’

President Obama sat anxiously in the Situation Room the night of the raid, flanked by Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and other high-ranking officials as they watched the events unfold.

SEAL Team 6, a group of two dozen elite Marines, were able to bring down the terrorist leader in his stronghold in Abbottabad, Pakistan. 

In today’s interview, Hannity prompted Mr Mukasey that the memo was ‘designed to protect the president politically.’

Mr Mukasey responded: ‘I think there is going to be more that come tumbling out about that escapade. But so far, that memo is enough.’

In the interview, the former attorney general put Mr Obama’s leadership in context to presidents of the past, including Abraham Lincoln and Dwight D. Eisenhower. 

Speaking first about Lincoln, Mr Mukasey referenced the speech he delivered after Gen. Lee surrendered, ending the Civil War.

‘Lincoln delivered what turned out to 
(be) his last speech from the window of the White House. He rejected 
taking any credit for it. Put it on General (Ulysses S.) Grant and the 
troops and then talked mostly about the problems of reconstruction.’

'You better believe if anything else had
been encountered and the mission had failed, then the blame would have 
fell on McRaven. That's what this is about.'

-Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey

Several US Navy SEALs spoke out to MailOnline approaching the one-year anniversary of bin Laden’s death, saying that it was a group effort and that Mr Obama is using the killing to springboard his re-election campaign.

One currently-serving SEAL said: 
‘Obama wasn’t in the field, at risk,carrying a gun. As president, at 
every turn, he should be thanking the guys who put their lives on the 
line to do this.’

The SEAL added: ‘He does so in his official speeches because his speechwriters are smart.’

The original note,
which was written by Mr Panetta when he was still serving as Director 
of the CIA, said the following: ‘Received phone call from Tom Donilon 
who stated that the President made a decision with regard to AC1 
(Abbottabad Compound 1).

Drafted: Then CIA-director Leon Panetta wrote in the note: 'The timing, operational decision making and control are in Admiral McRaven¿s hands. The approval is provided on the risk profile presented to the President'

Blame game: Former SEALs spoke out in April saying Obama was using bin Laden's death as a rallying point on the campaign trail; he is pictured today at an event in Richmond, Virginia

'The decision is to proceed with the assault.

Killed: Osama bin Laden was killed on the May 1 raid of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan

‘The timing, operational decision making and control are in Admiral McRaven’s hands.

'The approval is provided on the risk profile presented to the President. 

‘Any additional risks are to be brought back to the President for his consideration. The direction is to go in and get bin Laden and if he is not there, to get out. Those instructions were conveyed to Admiral McRaven at approximately 10:45am.’

Breitbart columnist Ben Shapiro echoed a similar sentiment, writing: ‘The memo doesn’t show a gutsy call. It doesn’t show a president willing to take the blame for a mission gone wrong.

'It shows a CYA maneuver by the White House…the hero here was McRaven, not Obama.

‘And had the mission gone wrong, McRaven surely would have been thrown under the bus.’

His comments went viral, with more than 160,000 tweets and 25,000 shares on Facebook. 

Independent magazine Mother Jones responded today with a counterpoint. Writer Kevin Drum called the theory ‘absurd’ and applauded their ‘creative nutbaggery.’

He wrote: ‘The idea of Obama getting credit for killing bin Laden just drives conservatives up a tree. 

‘At this point, many of them are, apparently, literally willing to believe anything that suggests otherwise.’
