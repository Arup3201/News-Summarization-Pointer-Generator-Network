A cruise crew member has been crushed to death while working on the outside of a ship after becoming wedged between a lift and a platform.

The man was carrying out maintenance work on the Carnival Conquest cruise ship while it was docked in port in New Orleans on Sunday.

The firm confirmed that he died after becoming stuck between a cherry picker - which lifts workers up -  and a platform holding one of the lifeboats.

It added in a statement: 'The ship's medical team responded, along with local 
paramedics, but, tragically, the crew member died. The ship was docked 
in its home port of New Orleans at the time.

'We extend our 
deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolences to our crew member's family
and loved ones in the wake of this terrible tragedy. Everyone in the 
Carnival family is heartbroken.'

The man's identity has not yet been released, Nola.com reports.

The accident took place at around 10am, and the Harbor Police and New Orleans Police Department responded.

It has been a troubled year for Carnival Cruise Lines, with the worker's death the latest in a string of incidents to befall the  company.

It comes just one week after a six-year-old boy drowned in the pool of one of the cruise liners, while at sea.

Carnival
Cruise Lines said in a statement that the boy, identified as Qwentyn 
Hunter, a child model from Winter Garden, Florida, drowned in one of its
pools.

Detective Javier Baez of the 
Miami-Dade Police Department said that the boy had been playing with
his 10-year-old brother and other family members in the pool on Sunday, October 13.

A
Carnival Cruise Lines spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times that there was no 
lifeguard on duty at the time of Qwentyn Hunter's death.

'We
do not have lifeguards on duty at our pools,' Carnival spokeswoman 
Jayme Weber told the Los Angeles Times on Monday morning.

'Parental supervision is required for children under 13.'

In this case, she said, 'there was a parent present at the time of the incident.'

'Carnival
extends its heartfelt sympathy to the family during this very difficult
time.

'The company's CareTeam is providing assistance and support,' 
Carnival Cruise Line said in a statement.

The Carnival Victory ship was on the last leg of a four-day Caribbean cruise when the boy drowned.

In February The Carnival Triumph broke down in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,000 passengers aboard.

Passengers were stranded for five days in horrific conditions.

They
described sewage-soaked floors and people defecating in sinks and 
showers. Passengers had nothing to eat but bread and onions and the ship
was listing badly to one side.

Later the same month, 18-year-old high school senior Seth Younes died of alcohol poisoning on the last night of an eight-day Carnival cruise.

toilets to overflow as the cruise was approaching its home port of Port 
Canaveral, Florida after a five-day cruise.

May 8:
Paul Rossington, 30, and Kristen Schroder, 27, were discovered missing 
when the Carnival Spirit liner docked in Sydney on May 10.

Authorities believe Schroder fell off the ship first and her panic-stricken boyfriend then jumped in to try to save her.

September 20: 41-year-old Michael Ward died aboard Carnival's Dream.

One of the two survivors of the 1985 MOVE bombing, Ward, also known as Birdie Africa, was found dead in a hot tub.
