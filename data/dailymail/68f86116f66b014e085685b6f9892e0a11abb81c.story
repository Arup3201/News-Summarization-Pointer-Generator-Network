When the family of Andres Escobar arrive 
at the Estadio Castelao wearing Colombia's No 2 shirt on Friday afternoon, 
they will stir the emotions of the millions watching back home.

Los
 Cafeteros are in a World Cup quarter-final for the first time and the 
country will be at a standstill as their team attempt to overcome the 
might of favourites Brazil.

Yet it 
is the grainy CCTV images of Escobar, who was gunned down in a car park 
following an argument about his unfortunate own goal at the 1994 World 
Cup, that have spurred on Jose Pekerman's team.

The image of Colombian football is a blur of colour and adventure, combined with the murky underworld of drug cartels and gangland killings. Even James Rodriguez, the World Cup's leading goalscorer, emerged from a shadowy start at Envigado, a club just outside Medellin.

Eight years ago, drug trafficker Gustavo Upequi, the owner of Envigado and an influential figure in Rodriguez's early development, was murdered at his home.

Here Colombia are trying to move on from their past and show the world that their football has some of the brightest talent in the game. The country's president, Juan Manuel Santos, is flying in for the match and he has declared a  half-day holiday for the country's 48m people.

Even English football has an affinity with Colombia's past, from goalkeeper Rene Higuita's famous scorpion kick at Wembley in 1995 to Faustino Asprilla's antics at Newcastle and Carlos Valderrama and that unruly mop of hair. Pekerman's team cruised through the group stages before Rodriguez helped  knock out Uruguay.

Valderrama, the undisputed king of Colombian football, believes 
Rodriguez, 22, could become the country's most celebrated player. The 
Monaco forward has been electrifying, the star of the tournament so far 
after scoring against Greece, Ivory Coast, Japan and twice against 
Uruguay in the second round.

'I've said how much I respect  El Pipe (Valderrama's nickname) because he is our football legend,' admitted Rodriguez.

'He
 was my hero as a boy and I wear the No 10 shirt he wore very, very 
proudly. To have him say nice things about me is wonderful.

'Carlos 
was one of the greatest Colombian footballers who has ever drawn breath.
 I loved sitting watching him play for us as a kid - every Colombian kid
 did. 

'If they are comparing me to him at the end of my career, 
that's when I will be extremely happy. He has done a lot for our country
 and he is a very good guy. But I have not proved myself at 
international level yet. If I can do that this summer and put a smile on
 his face, along with all the other Colombians, I will be very happy.'

The
 stadium is sold out and beating Brazil, for the first time since a 2-0 
group win in the Copa America in 1991, would be something special.

That was the Escobar era, when talents such as Higuita, Valderrama and Freddy Rincon were coming to prominence.

'I
 was just a young boy and I still remember how excited I was watching 
USA 94 on television,' added Rodriguez, speaking at a Q&A with 
adidas.

'I remember David Beckham scoring against Faryd Mondragon (in
 1998). It was huge for the country but of course it didn't end well.'

This
 is a new generation of players including Rodriguez, Porto forward 
Jackson Martinez and Mario Yepes, ready to surpass the team which won 
the Copa America in 2001.

'Our coach has got us playing and fighting 
for each other, and for Colombia,' said Rodriguez, who has been 
recognised as one of the most talented young midfielders in the world.

'It's
 nice to hear others say they think I am going well, especially when it 
comes from coaches and players. I use it as a positive but I don't let 
it give me a big head. That's when you think you have made it and things
 quickly go wrong for you.'

So far, everything is going right for Rodriguez and this team.
