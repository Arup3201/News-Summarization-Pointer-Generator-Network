The attention may be focused on Andy Murray as he attempts to claim the Norman Brookes 
Challenge Cup for the first time in Australia, but, as always, his girlfriend Kim Sears stole the spotlight.

The 25-year-old showed off her toned and tanned legs in a pair of Ted Baker shorts as she cheered her partner on in his men's singles match against Go Soeda of Japan at the Australian Open 2014 tennis tournament in Melbourne.

She looked fresh-faced as she opted for a natural make-up look and wore her hair in her trademark loose curls.

Loyal Kim was all smiles as she sat with Andy's second biggest fan, his mother Judy. The duo are fiercely supportive of Andy, who is partaking in his second competitive
 tournament following his back surgery in October.

Murray
 has been given a kind opener, however, against the Japanese world No 
112 Go Soeda in extremely hot conditions at the Hisense Arena.

Andy and Kim, who have been dating for eight years, were last pictured in public when the tennis ace became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in October.

While the couple are yet to tie the knot, the Scots tennis star recently revealed he is thinking about having children with long-term girlfriend Kim, with whom he shares a house with in Oxshott, Surrey.

Murray,
 26, reckons he is probably more than halfway through his career and is 
now beginning to contemplate what to do with his life when he hangs up 
his racket and quits the pro circuit. 

He
 said: ‘I can see myself having a family one day. It is something that 
I’m starting to think about because Kim and I have been together for 
eight years.’ 

In his new 
book reflecting on his life and career so far, the Wimbledon champion is
 effusive about his girlfriend, who he first met at the US Open in 2005.

Writing
 in the book, he said:
 ‘You’re in these huge cities meeting new people all the time and it 
would be easy to get your head turned.

Is that my seat? Kim mixed up her fashion with high-street shorts from a few seasons ago and a £1,350 Mulberry Willow Tote

All smiles: Kim chats to James Ward, the British no. 3 behind Andy Murray and Dan Evans, as they watch the match

‘But
 Kim’s always been there for me. She really cares about me and helps 
with so many things. She always has. That’s why we have such a great 
relationship.’ 

The 
Wimbledon winner admitted the experience of looking after their two dogs
 - Border terriers Maggie May and Rusty - would stand them in good stead
 if he and Miss Sears were to start a family.

He said: ‘It’s not the same as having kids - or at least I don’t think it is - but that’s sometimes what it feels like.’

As well as bonding over their love of dogs, he said they also share a passion for travel and don’t get homesick.

Style savvy: Kim's Ted Baker shorts are no longer unavailable, while her small willow tote in ballet pink grainy calf would have set her back £1,350

'Kim's always been there for me': In his new 
book reflecting on his life and career so far, the Wimbledon champion is
 effusive about his girlfriend, who he first met at the US Open in 2005

Perfect match: Murray first met Miss Sears when 
she was on holiday with her father, who was coaching Daniela Hantuchova 
on the Women's Tennis Association Tour

Murray
also praised Miss Sears’s ability to gauge when he needs company and 
when he wants to be alone as ‘fundamental’ to their relationship.

He said: ‘Kim sees all of the emotions when I win or lose a match, she can tell how I’m really feeling.’

After banking nearly £20million in 
prize money, Murray admits to feeling ‘vulnerable’ when bombarded by 
people wanting to do deals, so he relies on ‘savvy’ Miss Sears to spot 
those trying to leech onto

him.

Murray is playing well in Melbourne so far and could take on Auckland winner John Isner in the fourth round, Roger Federer or Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarter-finals and the world number one Nadal in the last four.

Last seen: Andy Murray and his long time 
girlfriend Kim Sears, who looked sophisticated and regal, were last pictured together at 
Buckingham Palace, where he became an Officer of the 
Order of the British Empire (OBE)

Earlier this year, Kim wore an £85 blouse from 
Whistles, left, and then a £150 dress from the same store, right, with 
her Topshop blazer to watch Andy play tennis

Kim wore Whistles again as she cheered her boyfriend to gold at the Olympics last summer
