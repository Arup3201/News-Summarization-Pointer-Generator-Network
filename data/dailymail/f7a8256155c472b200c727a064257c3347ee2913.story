Unspoilt is the word that springs to mind when you see the picturesque Cotswold village of Cowley.    

Traditional homes made of local stone blend into surrounding countryside and sit comfortably alongside the historic manor house, once the estate of the Horlicks drinks family.  

But the village’s well-heeled residents fear all that will change – thanks to a dramatically designed new house described by some as an ‘ugly cowshed’.

Under construction: This contemporary home has labelled an eyesore by villagers in Cowley, Gloucestershire

Picturesque: Most of the buildings in Cowley, which has a population of around 350 and was once home to the estate of the Horlicks drinks family, are made from local stone

They fear the building, which in its 
current partially built state has light-coloured walls and a shiny 
metallic roof, will set a precedent that will permanently alter Cowley’s
character.

The owner of the modern property – 
who could not be contacted by the Mail yesterday – has been granted 
planning permission, but residents say they were not made aware of 
last-minute changes to the plans.

Ray Goodwin, 78, a retired farm 
manager who has lived in Cowley since 1971, said: ‘Most of the houses 
around here are built of lovely Cotswold stone and all fit in.

‘It is so nice around here. But this 
one looks like an ugly cowshed. It has a massive tin roof and it is 
spoiling the view of many people around here.

‘It just does not look good at all. 
This is a traditional Cotswold village with a proud history. It used to 
be home to the Horlicks family.

‘The planners should not let a home 
like this be built in the first place. We’ve contacted the local council
about it and they said it’s not finished and we should wait until it’s 
done before we say it doesn’t fit in with the village.

‘We just want the planning department to do its job properly.’

Cowley, near Cheltenham, has a population of around 350.

Planning permission for the controversial new property was sought in 2002, originally for a studio and craft centre.

In the dark: Villagers are furious that the modern property is being built when they were unaware of last-minute changes to the plans

Neighbour Ray Goodwin, 78, is one of many residents whose property overlooks the new-build, which he describes as an 'ugly cowshed'

Consent was finally granted last year
after the designs were altered to include a bathroom and a bedroom, 
turning it into a contemporary home.

Edward Hollingworth, who has lived in the village since 1996, claimed residents had not been consulted about the development.

He said: ‘When the original 
application was made in 2002 it was for a studio and a craft centre, but
it’s just got bigger and bigger.

‘In 2010 the plans were changed so 
the roof is flat rather than curved and an additional bedroom and a 
bathroom were added and we weren’t notified. We’ve been to the planning 
office and the files are a complete mess.

‘We are worried it could set a precedent and someone could come along and try to build another one.’

Cotswold District Council  defended 
the development – stressing that all the correct procedures had been 
followed in the planning process.

A spokesman said: ‘While we 
acknowledge that the contemporary design may not be to everyone’s taste,
we can confirm that all the appropriate processes have been followed in
regard to this planning permission.

‘Anyone who has queries is welcome to review the relevant reports sent to the planning committee and the delegated approvals.’
