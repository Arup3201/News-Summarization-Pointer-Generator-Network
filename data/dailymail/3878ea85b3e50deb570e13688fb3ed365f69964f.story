The US Secret Service will
remove four senior officials while another has opted to retire
from the agency charged with protecting the president in its
latest shake-up after a series of security lapses, an agency
official said on Wednesday.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that Acting Director Joseph Clancy ordered the four assistant
directors who oversee the agency's missions of protection,
investigations, technology and public affairs to leave their jobs.

'Four assistant directors have been notified that they're
being assigned to other positions,' the official said.

Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy is seen here testifying on Capitol Hill on November 19. This week Clancy told four of the highest-ranking Secret Service executives that they need to resign, retire or be reassigned as a result of a series of security mishaps

According to the Washington Post, the directors were given the option to resign, retire or request a new assignment from the Secret Service or the Department of Homeland Security within the next 30 days.

They are: Mark Copanzzi, Paul Morrissey, Jane Murphy, and Dale Pupillo.

The assistant director in charge of Secret Service training,
Vic Erevia, who also headed Obama's protective detail, disclosed in recent
weeks that he was retiring.

'Change is necessary to gain a fresh perspective on how we
conduct business,' Clancy said in a statement published by the
Washington Post. 

'I am certain any of our senior executives will
be productive and valued assets either in other positions at the
Secret Service or the department. 

Still at the Secret Service is Deputy Director Alvin T. Smith, one of the agency's longest service leaders.

The management changes stem from recent lapses by the agency that included a knife-carrying man jumping the fence outside the White House
in September and entering the building. 

It was one of the worst security breaches since
President Barack Obama took office in 2009, and it resulted in the firing of Secret Service head Julia Pierson. 

Clancy, a retired Secret Service agent formally assigned to Obama's personal protection detail, was brought in as her temporary replacement. Obama has yet to nominate a new director.

Just-announced management changes at the Secret Service stem from lapses by the agency that included a knife-carrying man jumping the fence outside the White House in September and entering the building

In November, Clancy told Congress  he was seeking to establish
a culture of trust within the Secret Service after replacing Pierson, who left the agency on
Oct. 1. 

He also called the security breaches that landed him before the the congressional committee 'unacceptable' and 'simply inexcusable.'  

The high-profile demotions leave few members of Secret Service's old guard in positions of authority following a DHS audit released in December that concluded the agency was 'starved for leadership.'

Clancy confirmed to the Post that the reforms came as a result of the DHS review and 'my own assessments.'

Clancy said the Secret Service needs, at minimum, the 6,572 paid 'full-time equivalent' positions the White House has requested in its 2015 budget. In addition to the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign season, he noted, the agency will be expected to protect Pope Francis when he visits the U.S. next year.
