The woman linked to the slavery case who mysteriously died while living in a Maoist commune was at university with Cherie Blair, it has emerged.

Sian Davies graduated with a masters degree at the London School of Economics in 1975 alongside the wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair who had studied law.

One of the world’s top universities, the Russell Group establishment’s alumni includes some of the world's top politicians including 12 Nobel Prize winners, two presidents of Colombia, the former prime minister of Nepal, and former American president John F. Kennedy.

It specialises in social sciences and has numerous active political groups for students.

While Mrs Blair, then Ms Booth, was called to the bar a year later, Ms Davies immersed herself in south east London’s Maoist community.

One of Cherie Blair's former contemporaries told the Daily Mirror: 'Sian was quiet and shy. There were a lot of strange groups operating around the university and it looks like she got involved with one of them.'

Education: She was privately educated in Wales before studying law at Aberystwyth University

Ms Davies, who was privately educated in 
Wales before studying law at Aberystwyth University, died in 1997, seven
months after she fell from the window of a Maoist home in Herne Hill, 
south London.

When she died, she had just £5 in her bank account and her only possession was a stash of Marxist literature, according to reports.

In 1970 she had received thousands of pounds 
when her father Alun died - but apparently spent most of it on 
funding the far-Left movement based in South London.

It has also been claimed that Ms Davies' family, from whom she was enstranged, were so worried about her being exploited that they froze her bank account.

She was living with cult leader Aravindan Balakrishnan and his other followers.

Three other women, including Ms Davies' daughter Rosie, who has lived with the sect her whole life, escaped the property last week.

They were yesterday interviewed by 
police for the first time as officers investigate whether Balakrishnan, 
known as 'Comrade Bala', and his wife Chanda should face charges.

Ms
Davies, who was 44 when she died, was brought up in a middle-class 
family in North Wales and attended the prestigious Cheltenham Ladies' 
College.

She was drawn 
in to the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought 
after she moved to London for university in 1977.

The group relied on her inheritance to fund itself for many years, leaving her almost penniless, according to the Guardian.

The Maoists were apparently based for a time in a house in Battersea owned by Ms Davies, before she gave them £10,000 to lease their headquarters in Brixton.

Her family were unaware that she had had a daughter while living with Balakrishnan, and were not told that she had been left paraplegic after falling from a second-storey window.
