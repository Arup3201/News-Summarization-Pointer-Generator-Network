Wales' chances of lifting the RBS 6 Nations trophy could hinge on the fitness battle being waged by Italy captain Sergio Parisse.

Warren Gatland’s men need a thumping victory over the Italians on Saturday to have a chance of overhauling England and Ireland, who both boast superior points differences.

But Welsh hopes took a knock with news that Parisse, who limped off against France on Sunday, has been cleared of any serious damage to his right foot following an MRI scan in the Italian capital  and hopes to recover for Thursday’s team announcement.

Parisse revealed on Twitter that the soft-tissue injury is ‘less severe than expected’ and he could still feature alongside prop Martin Castrogiovanni, who is understood to have been recalled to the squad after suffering a serious dog bite on his nose three weeks ago.

Today he tweeted an image of his foot in an ice bath in a bid to get fit for the clash.

The veteran Azzurri pair have 221 Tests between them and their experience could be a major obstacle to Welsh ambitions of securing the necessary landslide victory at the Stadio Olimpico.

Wales kept themselves in contention for the title with a classic defensive display against Ireland on Saturday but, with the race likely to be decided by points difference, focus must now shift towards attack.

If the trophy is going to head back to Cardiff, then Gatland’s side must burst open the floodgates of the River Tiber and better the scoring record of both England and Ireland.

Having topped the tackle count at the Millennium Stadium with — according to the Welsh camp — a record-breaking 38 hits, Luke Charteris is hoping to keep his place in the second row. His side are up first in a triple-bill of fixtures and, with kick-offs staggered throughout the day, the 32-year-old has already decided how to kill the time as other results unfold.

‘We’ll have to find some good Italian wine,’ joked Charteris. ‘First, you have to try to win the game. If you look any further than winning the game by a point then you become unstuck.

‘That has happened in the past and as soon as you do that, you are disrespecting the opposition. If we can win, it gives us a chance.

‘We saw just how good a team they are when they won in Scotland. I know a few of the boys so it will be a really tough game.’

In an ideal scenario, Gatland would have had the option to keep the same starting XV that beat Ireland. But the Kiwi will be without tight-head prop Samson Lee, who was sent to London yesterday to seek specialist advice on a potentially World Cup-threatening Achilles injury.

The front-row problems have been compounded by doubts over Richard Hibbard and Gethin Jenkins — prompting call-ups for Exeter’s Tomas Francis and Saracens’ Rhys Gill, but not Adam Jones.

The 34-year-old British Lion has hinted that he could be drawn out of retirement, however Welsh forwards coach Robin McBryde insists the onus is on the player to reverse his decision.

‘We would be open to a call from him,’ said McBryde. ‘It was his decision to hang up his boots on the international front. I still have his number, but there’s no need to call him at the moment. As far as I’m concerned, he’s announced his retirement and, until he changes his mind, at the moment we have enough strength in depth.’

McBryde moved to allay concerns over Jamie Roberts after the 28-year-old was brought off with a head injury against Ireland. The Racing Metro centre has been a mainstay throughout the competition but, in Scott Williams, Wales have attack-minded cover that could exploit Italian weaknesses in the final quarter.

‘We have seen so far that up until the 60-minute mark Italy have been in the game and competing,’ said McBryde.

‘They will be hugely disappointed with their performance against France and I am sure they will be looking to finish on a high, so that makes them more dangerous. We are dealing with a wounded animal.

‘Saturday was a hugely physical Test and some of the players’ reactions following that match reflected the intensity.

‘The fact they have come out of that match on top makes the bruises feel that little less painful. The spirit is good and, by still being in the hunt for the title, everyone has come in with an appetite and an edge to build on the momentum.’
