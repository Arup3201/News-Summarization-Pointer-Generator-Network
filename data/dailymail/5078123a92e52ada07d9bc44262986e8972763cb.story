An elephant killed its keeper in a zoo 'because it was affected by the smell of paint', experts say.

The animal, which was being kept in an enclosure at the zoo in Vietnam, attacked his long-term trainer.

The zookeeper, Doan Huu Tai, was about to begin painting the cage of the nine-year-old elephant, Ka, Tuoi Tre News reports.

Ka grabbed Mr Tai with his trunk, smashed him against the wall of the cage and threw him into a water basin. The zookeeper later died from a brain injury.

Mr Tai, 28, had worked with the two-tonne elephant for at least seven years. They were both at the Dai Nam Tourist Center in Thu Dau Mot City north of Ho Chi Minh City.

Dr Pham Viet Lam, director of the Saigon Zoological and Botanic Gardens, said the smell of the paint Mr Tai brought into the cage may have irritated the animal and made it angry.

He said elephants can be affected when they experience unfamiliar colours, sounds or smells.

Trunks are very sensitive to smell and the paint could have made the elephant uncomfortable and caused him to attack his trainer, said Dr Vu Ngoc Thanh, a biology lecturer at Hanoi National University

In October, a 62-year-old zookeeper died after an Asian elephant called Patience charged at him in her enclosure as he fed her.

John Phillip Bradford, elephant manager at Missouri's Dickerson Park Zoo, had been with two other keepers in the animal's barn at about 8.45am when the incident happened.

It is not yet known what caused the 6,000lb elephant to attack her keeper, who had worked at the zoo for 30 years.

However, the elephant had a history of aggression.
