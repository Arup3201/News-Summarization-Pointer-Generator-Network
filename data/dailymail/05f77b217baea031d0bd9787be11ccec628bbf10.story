The mobile payments start-up Clinkle has not even been launched yet, and already it has found itself at the center of a new scandal after someone had hacked the site to reveal a very unflattering photo of the company’s 22-year-old CEO brandishing a cash fan.

The embarrassing ‘money shot’ depicts tech wunderkind Lucas Duplan, a recent Stanford University graduate who came up with an app that promises to revolutionize financial transactions with a digital wallet used on smartphones.

In his Clinkle profile picture, the baby-faced 22-year-old tech mogul is pictured with his mouth agape holding what was estimated to be about $30,000 in cash all in $100 bills.

Clinkle immediately went into damage control mode, publicly denying that the site had been actually hacked.

According to company spokeswoman Ana Braskamp, Andrew Aude, a former inter for the mobile payments company Venmo, took advantage of a ‘visibility’ feature that was being used in preliminary testing of the app, and which was meant to be disabled, NBC News reported.

According to the statement, Aude also accessed Clinkle’s system in September and exposed screen shots.

The site TechCrunch said that this latest digital security breach has affected only 33 test users, exposing their names, phone numbers and profile pictures, which ended up PasteBin - a public text storage site.

Addressing the Clinkle CEO's gauche 'money shot,' Braskamp noted that the cash in the ‘playful, self-deprecating’ picture was fake, Business Insider reported.

The controversy comes at a particularly bad time for Duplan's emerging business, which made headlines last month after firing 25 per cent of its staff.

Although a Clinkle engineer has reportedly dismissed the breach as 'no big deal,' it raises some serious questions considering that the start-up is promoting itself as a game-changing, secure mobile payments app.

It has been rumored that Clinkle will be made available to both iPhone and Android users later this year.

Clinkle is the brainchild of Duplan and a dozen of his Stanford classmates who came up with the idea back in 2011, but kept it under wraps until last year when the young entrepreneurs graduated.

Funded in part by Stanford professors, the ambitious mobile payments start-up has been widely  hailed by business insiders as the next big thing in Silicon Valley.

Articles in many publications 
breathlessly recounted how the company’s young CEO was able to secure 
$30million in investments from such big-name captains of industry as 
Richard Branson and Peter Thiel.

Troubles arose for Clinkle last November when pair of former employees penned a scathing - albeit badly misspelled – post on Quora that has arguably made a dent in Duplan’s ‘golden boy’ image.

According to the former Clinkle staffers, who noted that they left the company of their own accord, the 22-year-old CEO was earning a six-figure salary while mistreating his overworked and underpaid underlings.

‘He hurts his employees daily and shoves it under the rung [sic] as collateral damage,’ the ex-Clinkle workers lamented, adding that Duplan was a shark who prefers to control rather than lead his team.

Despite the bad publicity, Duplan has been able to recruit some impressive talent, with his most recent high-profile hires being PayPal vice president Mike Liberatore and former Netflix CFO Barry McCarthy.
