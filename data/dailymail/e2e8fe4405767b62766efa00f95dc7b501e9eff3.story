Former Tottenham director of football Damien Comolli has revealed Harry Redknapp decided to deploy Gareth Bale on the wing rather than at left back after analysing data.

Tottenham were reportedly considering the possibility of selling Bale to Birmingham for a mere £3million before deciding to convert the Welshman into a midfielder.

The north London side eventually sold Bale for a world record £86million when La Liga giants Real Madrid came calling in 2013.

Gareth Bale failed to impress at left back but turned into a superstar when he was deployed in midfield 

The Welsh winger is now considered to be one of the best players in the world for club and country

Comolli, who worked at Tottenham for three years, also stated in a recent interview with Newstalk that Daniel Levy decided to sign Rafael van der Vaart over an unnamed player because of data statistics.

'I’ve got to say, I’ve been working with data since 2005 or 2006 in terms of recruitment,' said Comolli.

'We did it at Spurs. We used data in terms of team selection.

'Spurs actually told Harry Redknapp where to play Gareth Bale, because he wanted to get rid of him.

'Data was showing Bale would be an outstanding left winger when they were playing him at left-back [because of his running and skill].'

When asked about Tottenham decision to sign Van der Vaart from Real Madrid in 2010, Comolli added: 'Spurs have never come out publicly saying it, but I am saying it because I don’t work at the club anymore.

'Spurs had the choice between signing Van der Vaart and another player, and Daniel Levy said we are going for Van der Vaart because data is telling us to.

'I won’t mention the other player who did nothing after that but Van der Vaart had a great two or three years at Spurs.'

Comolli went on to work for Premier League rivals Liverpool but left the Merseyside outfit by mutual consent in April 2012.
