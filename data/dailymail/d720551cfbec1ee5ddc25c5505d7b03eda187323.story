In retreat: David Cameron is expected to put on hold his plans to legalise gay marriage and modernise the House of Lords

David Cameron is expected to put on hold his plans to legalise gay marriage and modernise the House of Lords after his party's miserable showing in local elections sparked a backlash from angry Tory backbenchers.

The Prime Minister wants to make same-sex weddings lawful and to reform the system of unelected peers.

But he is expected to make only a vague pledge to reform the House of Lords in this week's Queen's speech, avoiding any firm commitments to implement the policy.

Mr Cameron is also understood to be ready to put the gay marriage plans on the backburner.

The retreat comes after Conservative MPs called on Mr Cameron to return to traditional Tory values following Thursday's elections, in which the party lost 12 councils and 405 seats.

Downing Street sources say the Prime Minister has recognised that he cannot push ahead with the controversial plans with support for the party waning.

George Osborne today indicated the reforms were being kicked into the long grass.

The Chancellor said he had taken the message from voters that ministers should be focusing 'on the things that really matter' rather than getting 'distracted' by too many other issues.

Mr Osborne said he was personally in favour of gay marriage but he denied there had been plans to bring forward a Bill in the Queen's speech.

He said the party was committed in its manifesto to 'looking' at Lords reform but it was 'not the priority of the Government'.

Mr Osborne added that the Government would "learn" from the verdict delivered at the ballot box on Thursday.

He told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show: 'I think what people are saying is focus on the things that really matter, focus on the economy and on education and welfare.

'Focus on those things, don't get distracted by too many other issues.'

Controversial: Dissent is growing among backbench Tory MPs about the Prime Minister's plans to allow gay couples to wed

Mr Osborne said it was clearly 'not 
the case' that voters had deserted the Conservatives in the elections as
a result of gay marriage proposals or Lords reform.

But he said that while Parliament would debate the planned shake-up of the upper chamber, it was not a 'priority'.

He added: 'We are focused on the really important issues that matter to people.

'Parliament can discuss these issues,
Parliament is very good at discussing these issues, but it is certainly
not my priority, the priority of the Government.

'It is not where the efforts of the Government and the executive are going to be directed.'

Pressure grew on Mr Cameron within 
the party after Boris Johnson managed to overturn a 19-point Labour lead
to secure re-election as London mayor.

Mr Johnson emphasised his right-wing 
credentials during the successful campaign and attacked the Government 
for its record on traditional Tory concerns such as immigration, tax 
cuts and Europe.

The
mayor's victory prompted calls for Mr Cameron to rein in 'wind turbine 
Toryism' and concentrate on the issues of most importance to 
Conservative voters.

Backtrack: George Osborne told Andrew Marr that the party was committed in its manifesto to 'looking' at Lords reform but it was 'not the priority of the Government'

Right-wing
Tory MPs led by David Davis and John Redwood believe a more radical 
economic strategy is needed to tackle the country's problems.

They are in favour of targeted tax cuts, deeper spending cuts and an end to expensive environmental regulation.

With such concern over the Government's direction, Mr Cameron's plans to modernise the House of Lords and allow gay couples to wed risk angering backbench MPs even more.

A Downing Street source told the Sunday Times: 'Gay marriage is something we genuinely want to do, but because of everything that has happened now is not the time.'

Priorities: Nadine Dorries says Britons are 'screaming out' for strong policies on law and order, a stable NHS and an in-out referendum on Europe

It is understood that Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, will hold talks with Mr Cameron and urge him to pursue policies for growth and increased flexibility in the jobs market.

The committee's executive will also meet chief whip Patrick McLoughlin and warn him about the dissent among Tory MPs and voters about gay marriage and Lords reform.

Mark Pritchard, secretary of the committee, said the party's council election defeat was not due to 'mid-term blues' - the dip in support often seen by governments halfway through their time in power.

'It would be high risk to continue to take our natural supporters in the country and the party for granted,' Mr Pritchard said.

'If the public believe our priorities are not their priorities, and it sticks, no amount of relaunches will suffice.'

Tory MP Nadine Dorrries, who last month branded Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne 'arrogant posh boys', has also called for a change in direction.

Criticism: Cardinal Keith O'Brien accused Mr Cameron of attempting to 'redefine marriage' for a 'small minority of activists'

She said: 'While Britons scream out for strong policies on law and order, a stable NHS and an in-out referendum on Europe to cut us free from basket-case Southern European economies, Cameron makes gay marriage and Lords reform his priorities.

'Even those who have no deep understanding of economics recognise that we need a strategy for growth, lower taxes, enterprise schemes to help local entrepreneurs, free-flowing bank capital and raising tax thresholds for the lower paid.'

Mr Cameron's support for gay marriage is particularly controversial.

In March Cardinal Keith O'Brien accused him of attempting to 'redefine marriage' for a 'small minority of activists'.

Defeat: The retreat comes after the Conservatives suffered heavy losses in local elections. Labour, led by Ed Miliband, made gains

Cardinal O'Brien insisted that the reforms would ‘shame the United Kingdom in the eyes of the world'. 

Mr Cameron is believed to have warmed to the idea of a referendum on Lords reform, which could be held as late as 2015.

The Queen's speech is expected to underline the importance of the family and to include a bill to reform maternity and parental leave.

Other proposals to promote marriage and family life are likely to include the offer of extra support for couples who are about to break up.

Divorced fathers could be given more rights to care for their children, except in domestic violence cases.

Tough measures on crime are also expected, along with a bill on banking reform.
