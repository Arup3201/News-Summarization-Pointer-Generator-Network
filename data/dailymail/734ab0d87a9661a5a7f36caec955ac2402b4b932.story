North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has banned citizens from sharing his name and ordered people using it to get 'trained' to change it. 

A leaked internal state document from the secretive state obtained by South Korean television contained 'an administrative order' to all party, army and police officials to ensure that the directive was carried out. 

According to the document: 'All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names.'

North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un has banned any people in his country from sharing his name ordering them to undergo 'voluntary training'

Officials in the secretive state have been ordered to search through identity records to uncover any fellow Kim Jong-Uns and re-educate them

He ordered the Communist Party, the army and the police to conduct checks and told officials to refuse any birth certificates sharing his name

Anyone named Kim Jong-Un would have their official documents, identity cards and even school diplomas changed to the person's new name. 

Officials were also told to reject all birth certificates for babies named after the dictator. 

The document continued: 'Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip... regarding this project.'

The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seoul's Unification Ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine.

But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-Sung and his son, Kim Jong-Il.

One South Korean Official said: 'Given the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now.'

The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for more than six decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult.

Park Jin-Hee, a North Korean defector working for KBS who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive had been effectively enforced.

A similar rule applied to Kim Jong-Un's father Kim Jong-Il and his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, who are revered in North Korean society 

Officials were warned against allowing any gossip of rumours surrounding the new naming policy to spread within the secretive state 

The new naming policy was contained in a leaked document which was published by a South Korean TV station earlier this week 

Park, who defected in 2008 said: 'There is no one in the North named Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-Un. 

Kim Jong Un made his international debut in late 2010 when he was awarded a slew of top political jobs. His father, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008, was seen as moving fast to hand over power so his family could rule for a third generation.

Kim Jong Il inherited power in 1994 when his father Kim Il Sung died.

North Korea enforces strict, state-organised public reverence of the Kim family, which serves as the backbone of the family's authoritarian rule of the impoverished country. 

All North Koreans are required to wear lapel pins bearing the images of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and to put the leaders' portraits on the walls of their homes. 

Their birthdays are considered the most important holidays in North Korea.
