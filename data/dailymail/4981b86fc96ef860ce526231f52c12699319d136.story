A cloud of shifting shape and speed that had many meteorologists baffled has turned out to be a swarm of butterflies migrating for the winter.

Weather workers in St. Louis, Missouri were vexed last week when they noticed a cloud on their radar that was heading south and kept forming into a variety of odd shapes.

One of those odd shapes, oddly enough, was the shape of a giant butterfly.

What are the odds: The cloud, which kept changing size and speed and baffled most meteorologists, was even shaped like a butterfly on the radar (above)

Winter break: What appeared to be a large cloud over St. Louis, Missouri was actually a swarm of Monarch butterflies (above) heading South for the winter

The National Weather Service was eventually able to conclude that this was an immense swarm of Monarch butterflies making their annual trip down to the mountains of Mexico for the winter months.

They shared this news, and how it is these delicate winged creatures were detected as a cloud, on their Facebook page last week.

The sheer size of this swarm is also good news as America's Monarch population has been in decline over the past few years due to habitat loss and extreme weather.

Bigger and better: The size of the swarm of butterflies is good news for the species, whose numbers had begun to drop recently in America due to habitat loss and extreme weather

The orange and black beauties will now fly thousands of miles south and, hopefully, make the trip back north come Spring.

As for the western United Sates population of Monarchs, they never actually leave the country, heading from the Rocky Mountains to sunny California come winter.
