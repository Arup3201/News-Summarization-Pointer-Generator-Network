The woman dubbed the 'poker princess' for her role playing hostess to the rich and famous at high stakes poker games has opened up about her illustrious clientele.

A memoir of Molly Bloom's time running the most exclusive poker game in Hollywood entitled Molly's Game, set to be published next Tuesday, is sure to have her former clients - actors, athletes, politicians and financial titans - slightly nervous about her revelations.

Last 
month, Bloom, 36, pleaded guilty to illegal gambling and was 
sentenced to 12 months probation and given a $1000 fine for her part in a high-profile gambling ring that attracted Hollywood heavyweights such as Ben
 Affleck, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon.

Valued for her discretion and paid generously for her confidentiality, Bloom was privy to some of the world's juiciest gossip.

She told ABC's 20/20 that during her games, players had 'six-figure losses, six-figure wins,' and that she herself earned $4 million in one year alone.

Tobey Maguire, she says, was a great player but a sore loser and worse tipper.

'I used to call Tobey "Hannibal Lecter" because he could just talk someone off of a good hand,' Bloom told 20/20.

In an adaptation of her book published in Vanity Fair earlier this month, Bloom wrote that the Seabiscuit star once told her to 'bark like a seal who wants a fish' for a chip.

Good will: 'Tall and handsome' Affleck was a regular player, said Bloom, while Matt Damon was polite and mild-mannered

'I'm not kidding,' he allegedly said to her. 'What's wrong? You’re too rich now? You won’t bark for a thousand dollars?'

The gambling goddess said that she refused to stoop to the level of barking, and that in return: 'He gave me an icy look, dropped the chip on the table and tried to laugh it off but he was visibly angry.'

Maguire would use his close friend Leonardo DiCaprio to attract bigger players to the game, she said.

Another way she placated demanding gamblers like Maguire, Bloom said, was to invite top sportsmen into the game.

'A-Rod was a novice player, but there’s something that happens to grown men, no matter how successful they are, when a professional athlete comes into the room,' Bloom said of baseballer Alex Rodriguez.

Novice: Alex Rodriguez wasn't an experienced player, but his presence at the table thrilled the other gamblers

Poker princess: Bloom says that since 2011, she's returned to 'a life that has meaning and substance' and works for a friend's business earning $19 an hour

In her book, Bloom claims Pamela Anderson's husband Rick Salomon asked Ben Affleck: 'Did Jennifer’s ass have cellulite on it, or was it nice?'

The Argo star is said to have held his silence for a moment before conceding, in front of a room full of celebrities, that 'it was nice.'

Ex-girlfriends aside, Molly also writes that having Affleck involved in the games was 'monumental' and that 'he was tall and handsome with a relaxed charisma that not all icons have in person.'

But Jennifer Garner's husband didn't go all-in too quickly, according to the Poker Princess.

He was 'a smart player who liked to limit his downside,' with his buy-in being comparatively small at $50,000.

His Good Will Hunting pal Matt Damon, she told 20/20, was nothing like his poker-addict Rounders character, and turned up only once.

'He was lovely, modest, down-to-earth, very gracious,' Bloom said.

Titanic wins: Leonardo DiCaprio was a regular player in Bloom's circle, which had a buy-in of up to $100,000

Molly also reveals that Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen were responsible for bringing in a billionaire to her table.

'When the Olsen twins showed up with a billionaire I was trying to land for a game, they were in, no questions asked,' she writes.

Things fell apart for Bloom when she began demanding a cut of the pot, instead of just relying on tips, which turned her actions into organized crime.

Bloom told 20/20 that when she declined the demands of two mobsters for a piece of her profits, she was beaten up in her own apartment by a hired goon.

Soon after, one of her games was raided by the FBI and her bank accounts were frozen.

Bloom told the court last month that since 2011, she had returned to 'a life that has meaning and substance.'
