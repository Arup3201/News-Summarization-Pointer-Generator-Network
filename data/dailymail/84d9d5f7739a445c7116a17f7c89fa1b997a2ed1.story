With just over a month to go until she gives birth, Kate would have been forgiven for putting her feet up for the last few weeks of her pregnancy.

But today, as she arrived at Westminster Abbey to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation, the Duchess of Cambridge showed she has no intention of hiding away in the final stretch.

The Duchess unveiled yet another outstanding maternity look for the occasion: a bespoke Jenny Packham dress and coat.

The dress was described as a 
'delicate daisy lace dress with silver grey ribbon detail' while the 
jacket was described as soft peach silk shantung.

Kate
 accessorised the outfit with a pale peach pillbox hat by milliner Jane 
Taylor, worn last year for the Jubilee celebrations at St Paul's.

She also wore a dazzling pair of earrings, which are reported to have been a wedding gift from Prince Charles. 

The Queen, arriving on the dot of 11 o'clock, wore a stunning pale gold dress with pleated bottom, thought to be made by her in-house dressmaking team, led by Angela Kelly.

Camilla too opted for a pale shade, wearing a nipped-in coat in the lightest shade of egg shell blue and a broad-brimmed lace-trimmed hat.

Kate, who is known for her love of recycling her clothes, has donned this peach Jane Taylor hat before.

The Duchess of Cambridge last wore the stylish hat in June last year as she led one of the tables at a 
Westminster Hall lunch held in honour of the Queen for her Jubilee.

After a reception at Guildhall, Kate was one of a number of royals including 
Charles and Camilla who attended the  City of London Livery companies lunch, held for some
700 guests representing abundant trades and professions,
ranging from grocers and gunmakers to fruiterers and fishmongers.

Kate was placed at the Master Glovers and Pattenmakers table, a body 
founded in the 17th century as a trade association for the makers of
pattens - under-shoes of wood and metal which were worn strapped 
beneath the shoes to raise the wearer out of the mud on the streets.

We've seen that before! The Duchess wore the Jane Taylor hat last June as she attended a Jubilee reception at the Guildhall following the morning service before hosting their own tables at a City of London Livery Companies lunch

Firm favourite: The cocktail hat in beaded chiffon and trimmed with silk chiffon and tulle discs is one of her firm favourites
