Britain’s hop farmers have been saved due to an overwhelming thirst for American real ale.

Sales of the crop have increased by almost 65 per cent in the last four years after decades of decline thanks to the US’s booming ale market.

The phenomenal rise in popularity of ‘craft beer’, whereby small-scale brewers market their own drinks, has led many producers to the UK in search of more distinctive flavours.

British farmers sold 600 tonnes of hops last year compared to 365 tonnes in 2009, while the price of the ingredient has also increased.

The flowers of the hop plant are one of the key components in beer production and different varieties can be used to impart an array of flavours and add bitterness.

British hop farmers have struggled with plummeting sales in recent decades due to the popularity of continental lagers and a failure to take advantage of export opportunities within the EU.

There are now only 2,500 acres of hop fields in Britain compared to 77,000 acres at the industry’s peak in the 19th century.

The US and Germany are now the major hop-growing nations, enjoying around 30 per cent each of the global market.

Due to the UK’s milder climate, the country creates hops that give more delicate flavours and can be used to produce beers such as Indian pale ale (pictured, Stone India Pale Ale)

But American brewers have sought out British hops, which are milder in flavour and traditionally used in British ales, to distinguish their beers and some producers are increasing their farms as a result.

Due to the UK’s milder climate, the country creates hops that give more delicate flavours and can be used to produce beers such as Indian pale ale.

Trevor Stirling, a brewing industry analyst with Bernstein Research, said: ‘Craft beer is still growing like a steam train in the States.

‘There’s a definite move in the States to dial down the strength of their beers, which boosts demand for the milder British hops.

‘There are already 2,500 craft ale breweries in America, but I think one can safely say that there are at least five years of good growth left, maybe 10.’

Jim Kuhr, from American’s Matt Brewing Company said the business has been purchasing more and more British hops and he is travelling to the UK on a buying trip next week.

‘I like English hops because of their subtle, earthy quality. They create very drinkable beers,’ he said.

‘The difficulty in America is differentiating your beers from the rest, and using English hops mean we can get away from the piny, citrusy taste of most American craft ales.’
