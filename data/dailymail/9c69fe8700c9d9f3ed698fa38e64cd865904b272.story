A battle of the banking giants has begun
after Barclaycard introduced a record 24 months of interest-free credit for
balance transfers.

The move by the UK's biggest credit card
provider comes in response to a 20-month interest-free card launched by
Halifax.

The deals could offer a lifeline to
thousands of Britons who are being saddled with punishing interest bills due to
large credit card debts.

Balance transfer war: Barclaycard has launched its Platinum card with a two-year 0 per cent transfer period

However, there are questions over how many
customers will be accepted by the credit card providers.

And critics have argued that the lengthy
interest-free deals could encourage the reckless 'spend now, pay later'
attitude that leads shoppers into debt in the first place.

The new Barclaycard Platinum Extended
Balance Transfer Visa carries a fee of 2.8 per cent of the sum being moved on
to the card, but offers £20 cashback for customers who transfer a balance of
more than £3,000 directly through the Barclaycard website.

Michelle Slade, of personal finance
website Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: 'At 0 per cent for 24 months, the new deal from
Barclaycard is the longest balance transfer deal ever offered on the market.

'In the last year, the number of longer
term balance transfer deals has soared as competition has returned to  the
credit card market.'

MBNA and Virgin Money already offer 0 per
cent for 19 months.

Miss Slade pointed out that while there is
no interest on the balance transfers, any new purchases made with these cards
will attract interest at an average rate of 18.7 per cent.

Hannah-Mercedes Skenfield, credit card
spokesman at Moneysupermarket.com, said: 'Over the last week, we have seen the
credit card wars really hotting up with Halifax introducing a 20-month balance
transfer deal.

Temptation: Critics have argued lengthy interest-free deals could encourage the reckless 'spend now, pay later' attitude that leads shoppers into debt in the first place. (Posed by models)

'However, Barclaycard has responded immediately with a deal that
blows all others out of the water, a staggering two-year interest-free on
balance transfers - a UK first.

'It is difficult to see how this deal can
be bettered. Barclaycard's latest 24-month product charges a competitive 2.8
per cent balance transfer fee.

'This means a consumer making just the
minimum payments on a UK average card balance of £2,221 could save up to £597
over the lifetime of the promotional deal, even once the balance transfer deal
has been factored in.

'This is a fantastic deal for consumers
looking to consolidate existing credit card debt, but anyone going down this
road needs to remember to avoid making purchases on the card or
they risk losing their promotional zero per cent rate and could end up
getting stung with hefty interest payments.

'To avoid this, customers should set up a
direct debit to pay off at least the minimum amount each month.'

Stefan Maryniak, personal finance expert
at uSwitch.com, said the competition among card companies would benefit
consumers who are trying to clear their debts.

However, he warned: 'The devil lies in the
detail. Having a market leading product is only great for customers if they can
get it.

'Barclaycard's previous 20-month balance
transfer proposition proved hard to get for customers without a squeaky clean
credit rating.

'Having now stretched the balance transfer
period to a staggering two years, it remains to be seen just how many of those
who apply for the card will actually be accepted.

'This
begs the question whether the new card is just for show or whether consumers
will really get to benefit.'
