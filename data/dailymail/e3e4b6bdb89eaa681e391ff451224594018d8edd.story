The Church of England is to allow full funerals for the first time to people who die by suicide.

The decision sweeps away ecclesiastical laws which for centuries have said suicide is sinful and those who die by their own hand must be denied the complete rites of Christian burial.

The Church’s parliament, the General Synod, voted overwhelmingly yesterday to end the ban on funerals for suicides to signal its compassion for the vulnerable.

Synod members also heard that many clergy do give burial services to suicides and have done so for years despite the letter of Church law.

Members of the General Synod (pictured) voted by 262 to five to allow a full burial for those who have committed suicide. The practice is thought to be widespread already, despite church law forbidding it

Church officials said the reform will bring the CofE into line with the 1961 Suicide Act, which abolished the idea that committing suicide was a crime.

However the move comes at a time of growing political pressure for the legalisation of assisted suicide to allow the desperately disabled or dying help to take their own lives.

The declaration of a new liberal Church attitude to suicide is likely to be taken as encouragement by activists pushing for the repeal of the 1961 law, which sets down a maximum 14 year jail sentence for anyone who aids and abets a suicide.

The Church’s founding Book of Common Prayer, which dates from the 16th century, says that the funeral service may not be used ‘for any that die unbaptized, or excommunicate, or have laid violent hands upon themselves.’

Suicides were often buried outside a consecrated churchyard or on the north side of the church, without the benefit of the Prayer Book burial service.

Current Church law says that a specially adapted funeral service must be used in the case of anyone who has killed themselves who was ‘of sound mind’. 

However, few bishops have ever produced such services for their clergy to use.

Gloucester vicar Canon Michael Parsons told the Synod: ‘We take funerals of murderers, rapists, child abusers and gangsters and we are happy to commit them to mercy of God. But not, it seems, suicides.'

He said most clergy disregard the law or are surprised to find they are conducting funerals that break the rules.

‘Passing this motion will be seen as hugely positive pastoral step. Do we want to be part of church that rejects vulnerable people?’ he said.

Canon Parsons added in a paper for the Synod that the Church law ‘may lie behind a widespread public perception that suicide is the unforgiveable sin and hence the Church will disapprove.

‘There are public memories of real or imagined Church hostility. Yet pastoral practice has for many years been much more sympathetic and the vast majority of clergy today would wish to minister to the family in every way possible.’

The CofE has long abandoned any official disapproval of suicide. As long ago as 1959 a Church report said that ‘a person who attempts suicide must be in a state of mental distress and therefore needs special sympathy and understanding.’

The Synod voted to change Church law by 262 votes to five, with six abstentions. Senior clergy and officials will now consider how to change the rules. They will also consider whether to allow full funerals for people who have not been baptised.

An assisted suicide law which would allow terminally ill people with six months to live the right to deadly drugs, as long as they are of sound mind and settled on their wish to die, is currently being considered in the House of Lords. 

Some senior judges have indicated they are in favour of allowing the desperately ill to get help to kill themselves.
