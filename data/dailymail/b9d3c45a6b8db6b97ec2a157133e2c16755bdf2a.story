Lancashire must thrash Middlesex in the final round of County Championship matches if they are to avoid a second relegation in three years and an unwanted piece of Roses history.

Never before have Yorkshire won the title and Lancashire been demoted in the same season, but that scenario awaits the Red Rose unless they can get a result at Old Trafford to send Middlesex down instead.

Lancashire, without Jimmy Anderson and overseas player Usman Khawaja, must win by 19 points, leaving Middlesex favourites to avoid the drop.

Middlesex looked in big trouble against Somerset last week, but Chris Rogers made a double century to earn a draw.

Lancashire’s batting has let them down this year but they will probably need 400 against Middlesex to claim maximum batting bonus points and give themselves a chance.

Lancashire’s Simon Kerrigan admitted he felt defeat by Sussex this month condemned his side to relegation. 

‘We felt pretty down after the Sussex defeat but we’ve been given this bonus opportunity. If we have a good game you never know,’ he said.
