Hundreds of Britain’s best-loved Victorian buildings should undergo ‘urgent’ safety inspections to prevent a repeat of the ceiling collapse that hit London’s Apollo Theatre, according to an official report.

Investigators found that the collapse in the West End last December, during which nearly 80 people were hurt, was caused because hessian fibres within the plaster holding up the ceiling had worn away.

The calls come after an investigation into the collapse of the Apollo Theatre's ceiling last December

Some of Britain’s most famous landmarks, such as the Royal Opera House, are adorned with the same type of plasterwork, raising fears that they are also potentially dangerous.

Westminster Council, which compiled the report into the Apollo collapse, urged English Heritage, the National Trust, the Health and Safety Executive and theatre owners to inspect buildings with such ceilings  as a ‘matter of urgency’.

Architecture expert Jonathan Taylor predicted that hundreds of listed properties would need to be looked at and the cost could become ‘very expensive’.

Mr Taylor warned: ‘Every major city will have a theatre or cinema with fibrous plaster ornament.’

80 theatre goers were injured when the ceiling came down during a performance at the end of last year
