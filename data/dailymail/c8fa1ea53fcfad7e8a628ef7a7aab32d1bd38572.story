More than 200 years after the original was wrecked at sea, a life-sized replica of the Hermione has embarked on a series of sea trials to prepare for its maiden transatlantic voyage.

The replica of the French navy frigate that shipped General Lafayette to America in 1780 tested the waters for the first time today after her careful construction lasted 17 years.

The three-masted ship departed a harbour in Rochefort, France in a major step toward its voyage to the US, where it will follow in the footsteps of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette in April 2015.

Completed in 1779, the original Hermione is famous for ferrying General Lafayette to America to lead rebels fighting British troops in the US War of Independence.

The wooden replica was built with 18th century shipbuilding techniques and materials - from the pulley systems to the massive oak hull - and cost a staggering £20million to complete. It was financed by the shipyard’s four million visitors and crowd-funding efforts.

Its construction began in 1997 after a group of enthusiasts formed the Hermione-Lafayette Association, attracting artisan craftsmen from across Europe.

Benedict Donnelly, the association’s president, the Agence France-Presse: ’It is an important step to sail Hermione at sea, which no one has ever done.

‘There is real pride in the collective force behind this project. There have been tense moments, but we remained united.’

After departing Rochefort, the new version will make its way to the Atlantic Ocean, where it will spend several weeks partaking in sea trials while based at Ile-d’Aix.

Thousands of people queued along the Charente river to catch a glimpse of the 213ft-long frigate, whose departure was delayed until today due to a build-up of sediment.

It was a moment nearly two decades in the making.

Once the sea trials are complete, the Hermione will displayed to the public in Bordeaux for nearly a full week in October before returning to Rochefort to prepare for its journey overseas.

The replica will follow the same route that General Lafayette took, with an arrival in Yorktown, Virginia scheduled for June 2015.

Yann Cariou, an ex-naval officer, will captain the frigate for its maiden voyage to the US. The original was wrecked at sea in 1793.

General Lafayette cemented his place in history by having a significant hand in the ousting of monarchies and creation of new regimes in America and France.

He became one of the most important figures in the US War of Independence (1775 to 1783) before he played a pivotal role in the French Revolution (1789 to 1799) in his home country.

Born into the wealthy Motier family, known by their ancient noble title of La Fayette, he joined the military at a young age and later became a hero in both America and France as he fought alongside the American colonists in key battles against British troops.

In April 1780, he arrived aboard the frigate Hermione in command of French forces – marking his second trip to America during the war – and was put in charge of the defence of Virginia with the rank of major general.

Lafayette, a close friend of George Washington, the American commander in chief, employed strategies that eventually drew British commander Lord Charles Cornwallis into a trap at Yorktown, Virginia, allowing the united French and American forces to defeat him.

Cornwallis’ surrender brought an end to the war, paving the way for American independence.

When he returned to France in 1782, Lafayette was celebrated as ‘the hero of two worlds’ and given the rank of brigadier general in the French army.

In the following years, he aligned himself with the revolutionary bourgeoisie and became one of the most powerful men in France during the first few years of the French Revolution.

With France bordering on political and social upheaval, Lafayette served as a leader of the liberal aristocrats and an advocate of religious toleration and the abolition of the slave trade.

He was elected as a representative of the nobility to the States General but supported the bourgeois deputies of the Third Estate in their efforts to gain control and convert the States General into a revolutionary National Assembly.

He joined the National Assembly and drafted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

He was appointed commander of the newly formed national guard of Paris and his troops saved Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette from a mob that invaded Versailles in 1789. They became hostages of the revolution.

Lafayette supported measures that transferred power from the aristocracy to the bourgeoisie while attempting not to protect the constitutional monarchy.

But he fell out of favour and was forced to resign when about 50 demonstrators demanding the abdication of the king were killed by his guards in the Champ de Mars massacre in 1791.

Lafayette became a commander of the army as France went to war with Austria but after the monarchy was overthrown and he refused to serve the National Convention he was declared a traitor and was forced to defect.

He was held captive by Austrian forces until Napoleon Bonaparte secured his release, and he returned to France in 1799.

After the monarchy was restored in 1814, Lafayette sat in the Chamber of Deputies during most of King Louis XVIII’s reign and in 1830 he commanded the national guard that helped overthrow King Charles X and install Louis-Phillippe on the throne, although he later became disillusioned with the new king.

Lafayette, long regarded as a symbol of friendship between France and America, died in May 1834 following a battle with pneumonia.
