Once seen as the bastion of 
counter-culture a common criticism leveled at the Burning Man festival in recent years 
is that it has blanded out and become overrun with too many 
business-minded from the tech industry.

And Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz did nothing to dispel that image when he revealed in a blog entry on Thursday that he took his boss Mark Zuckerburg along to last week's event in the Nevada Desert.

Moskovitz met Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, dropped out at the same time and is now worth an estimated $4 billion.

So inspired was Moskovitz on his return from a week in the desert that he wrote a blog post ‘Radical Inclusion vs. Radical Self-Reliance at Burning Man’ in which he revealed that Zuckerberg had stayed at the camp he built.

Burning Man veteran and Facebook co-founder David Moskovitz has revealed that this year he took his boss Mark Zuckerberg along and that he mucked in and helped to put his own tent up

Party in the desert: Over 60,000 revelers converged on the Black Rock Desert in Nevada last week for the Burning Man festival

The blog featured a lengthy explanation of Moskovitz's 
cool Burning Man credentials - because he’s been the past five years - and he 
went on to give an interesting insight into what all those geeks were up
 to out in the desert. 

He
 confirmed that Zuckerberg had been in attendance, but was quick to deny
 any suggestions that his boss had ‘paid into a turnkey experience.’ 

‘Along with its other inhabitants, he helped pitch his own tent,’ wrote Moskovitz.

‘I
 wanted him to experience the city and to experience gifting because I 
thought it would make him grow as a person and the world better off as a
 result; I believe that’s exactly what happened, however marginally (he 
was already a pretty great person).’ 

Facebook co-founder David Moskovitz has revealed that he bumped into the Winklevoss twins at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert and that all is forgiven for when they tried to sued him

Moskovitz also revealed that he had 
an emotional meeting with former arch enemies the Winklevoss twins, who 
had famously sued the Facebook founders.

Even
 though Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss ‘are among the only people on earth
 I might describe as real antagonists in my life or even enemies,’ 
Moskovitz said he went up and introduced himself to them.

‘In
 spite of our tangled history, I had never actually met them; we only 
communicated through lawyers. My first instinct was that I quite 
obviously needed to introduce myself and start with hugs.

‘They
 had just arrived so I wasn’t sure how they’d react, but they were very 
gracious at the time and I knew they’d understand more deeply by the 
time they left.

'Almost
 immediately when I got back, I had a Facebook friend request from Tyler
 and we started a thread mutually extolling the virtues of the festival.

Each night at the Burning Man festival another art installation is set on fire, on Saturday night it was the turn of the man

'In no uncertain terms, he described a
 spiritual awakening. I had created all kinds of dark fantasies about 
how meeting them would go (Tyler assures me it would have been cordial 
regardless), but on playa it was laughably clear. There, we were all 
part of the same community. We were always part of the same community.'

Renewed
 by ‘a deep appreciation of the fully connected and mutually supportive 
community,’ Moskovitz went on to encourages more ‘entrepreneur invaders’
 to experience the event.

‘When
 I hear about anyone going for the first time, my immediate thought is 
“that is so great for them” and when they are a person who has pooled 
power or capital around them, it is usually followed by “that is so 
great for the world.”’

The joke in Silicon Valley is that 
last week was the worst time possible for starts-ups to fund-raise 
because all the venture capitalists and leaders from the tech world had 
gone to the Nevada desert to experience the Burning Man festival.

This year's event was the largest ever with a capacity crowd of 68,000 people from all over the world - and a substantial number of tech billionaires

The
 week-long art, music and everything-else festival where each night is 
capped by the torching of elaborate large wooden sculptures was 
celebrating its 27th year and ended on Labor Day.

Once
 seen as the bastion of counter-culture a common criticism leveled at 
the event in recent years is that it has blanded out and become overrun 
with too many business-minded from the tech industry.

In
 the past Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have attended and 
so too has their CEO Eric Schmidt, in fact they’ve joked that that's how
 he got the job in the first place, reports Verge.

Amazon’s Jeff Bezos is another billionaire who enjoys the party in the Black Rock Desert, some 120 miles north of Reno.

As well as a sizable number of tech billionaires, this year’s event was also attended by celebrities including P Diddy and George Clooney's ex-girlfriend Stacy Keibler who have both described going as a ‘life changing experience,’ while Former NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark was also 'spotted' at the festival.
