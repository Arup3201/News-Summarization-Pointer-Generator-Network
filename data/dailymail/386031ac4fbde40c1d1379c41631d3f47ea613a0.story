Fatal: Toxins from lead can put women in danger of pre-eclampsia

With their sash windows, open fires and wooden floors, period properties are popular first family homes.

But renovating an old house while pregnant could put mothers-to-be and their unborn children at risk, experts have warned.

They say DIY on such properties can release lead from old paintwork, a poison that can raise blood pressure, putting women at risk of pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication that can be fatal to both mother and child.

Researchers also found that open fires can pose a serious risk, as burning coal releases lead particles into the air.

Passed from mother to baby in the womb, the toxin can also stunt intelligence and may make children hyperactive. It is thought that even relatively small amounts can be dangerous. 

The Bristol University study also flagged up alcohol, coffee and even pet dogs as potential sources of lead in pregnancy.

Dr Caroline Taylor, an expert in the effect of various metals on children’s growth and development, looked at lead readings in blood samples taken from more than 4,000 pregnant women from the Bristol area.

Readings were higher than those found in similar groups in other developed countries – and were particularly high in women who were educated to degree level.

This was unexpected as it is normally thought that exposure to environmental toxins is higher in poorer populations. The researchers are not sure why better-educated women are at greater risk, but speculate it is because they are more likely to buy older homes and renovate them.

Although lead is now banned in paint, it can still be released from woodwork that is being stripped of its original paintwork.

Potential sources include cornices and skirting boards, as well as floorboards that are being stripped down to create fashionable bare-look flooring.

Danger: DIY can release lead from old paintwork, researchers warned

Writing in the journal PLoS ONE, Dr Taylor said: ‘A possible explanation is that women with higher educational attainment lived on older housing stock rather than on modern estates and were perhaps involved in the renovation of older properties; this might cause exposure to lead-based paints, through sanding old woodwork, and to large amounts of dust that has accumulated over many decades.’

However, the factor she found to be most strongly linked with lead levels in a pregnant woman’s blood was having a coal fire at home.

Coal contains lead which is released in smoke. Dr Taylor did not find any evidence that wood-burning stoves, which are becoming increasingly popular, cause a similar problem.

However, alcohol, coffee and smoking were all linked to higher levels of lead while eating foods rich in iron and calcium was associated with lower readings.

Surprisingly, the study found that women who had a pet dog also tended to have higher amounts of lead in their blood. The effect was small but could be caused by the pets bringing contaminated soil and dust inside.

The study is the largest of its kind ever done in the UK. The samples were taken in the early 1990s as part of a long-running health project.

The use of lead has fallen since then, but with even small amounts of the metal believed to be dangerous, Dr Taylor believes it is important that pregnant women are aware of the risk. 

She said that they should not be alarmed but follow the general advice for a healthy pregnancy, including stopping or reducing alcohol and coffee intake and quitting smoking.

The researcher added: ‘If you have a house that was built before 1960 and you are scraping away original paint, you might want to think twice about that.’
