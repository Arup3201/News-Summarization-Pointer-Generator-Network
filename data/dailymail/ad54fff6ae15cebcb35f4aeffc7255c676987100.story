Two Paris policemen were today charged with the rape of a tourist after one admitted having ‘consensual sex’ with her.

Both officers were among four arrested last week when a 34-year-old Canadian said she was attacked following a rowdy drinking session. 

CCTV shows her entering and leaving 36 Quai des Orfevres – the famous headquarters of the city’s judicial police next door to the city’s law courts.

The woman – who is from Toronto but cannot be named for legal reasons – met the men in an Irish pub just across the Seine River from the building late on Tuesday night.

She got into conversation with the off-duty men because she said she worked for Canadian police in her home city for three years.

‘The evening was a drunken one, and members of the BRI were said to be involved in the attack,’ said a source close to the case.

The BRI, the so-called ‘Research and Intervention Brigade’, is an ‘anti-gang’ squad set up by the French Interior ministry to combat organised crime.

The woman is said to have been persuaded to visit the men’s offices in the Quai des Orfevres – an address which is as well known in France as New Scotland Yard is in Britain.

She arrived in France on April 18 and was due to spend two weeks visiting Paris. The source said ‘she was in a state of hysteria’ when she reported the rape on Wednesday morning. 

The officers arrested, including a captain, a lieutenant, a brigadier and major, were all originally placed in custody.

The investigating source confirmed that the two of the policemen have now been charged, while two others were released on Saturday.

Sebastien Schapira, a lawyer for one of the men charged, said his client admitted consensual sex, but ‘firmly denied’ rape.

An investigation is being coordinated by the IGPN – a police designed to deal with crimes committed by police officers. 

None of the parties to the case can yet be named for legal reasons.
