A toddler in China has been killed and partially eaten by a pig after crawling into the animal's pen while his parents' backs were turned.

Two-year-old Wei Tsao, known affectionately as Keke, had been playing in the garden of his parents' house, in eastern China's Jiangsu Province, when they went inside for a moment.

Left to his own devices Wei crawled into the pig pen where the protective sow mauled him to death in an attempt to protect her newborn piglets, before she began chewing on his head.

Hearing their child's screams, the parents rushed back outside but found they were too late.

Distraught father Sun Tsai, 25, said: 'We had popped inside for just a couple of minutes when we heard the screams.

'When we came out we saw the pig about 80 metres away gnawing on Keke's head.'

Other villagers came rushing to the scene where they grabbed the pig and tied it to a tree before killing it and cutting its stomach open.

Inside they found fragments of Keke's skull and hair, which they showed to authorities to prove the pig had killed him.

Village leader Cheng Yuan, 62, said: 'This is a horrible tragedy. We had to cut the pig open, not as an act of revenge but to prove to the authorities that it had indeed killed and eaten Keke.'

A police spokesman said: 'Sows are often docile creatures but pregnant pigs and ones who have just given birth can be very protective and turn aggressive towards anything they consider to be a threat to their piglets.

'We urge farmers to keep their pigs in their pens.'
