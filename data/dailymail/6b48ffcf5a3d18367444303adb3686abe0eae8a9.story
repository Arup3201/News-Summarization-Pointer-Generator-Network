The Duke of Edinburgh was taken to hospital yesterday after a recurrence of the infection which forced him to miss part of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

Prince Philip, 91, was taken 50 miles by land ambulance from the royals’ retreat at Balmoral to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.

Doctors there confirmed a bladder infection, which kept him in hospital for five nights two months ago, had returned.

Good spirits: The Duke appeared happy and healthy during an appearance at the Cowes Regatta on the Isle of Wight

Monday: The Duke looked in good health as he strolled around Cowes, Isle of Wight, waving at well-wishers

Appearance: The Duke spent Monday and Tuesday on the Isle of Wight, carrying out several public engagements

The Duke had met wellwishers and strolled around the Isle of Wight during his public engagements earlier this week, but has since been hospitalised

The latest health scare will raise 
inevitable questions about the strains imposed on the Duke by his 
workload of royal engagements. He made a number of visits to the Olympic
Games before travelling to Scotland, then heading for Cowes on the Isle
of Wight from where he flew back to Balmoral yesterday morning by 
helicopter.

Buckingham Palace said he was taken to
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary from the castle in the Cairngorms ‘as a 
precautionary measure’ and was expected to stay in hospital ‘for the 
next few days’.

A palace statement said: ‘The Duke of 
Edinburgh has had a recurrence of the bladder infection that he had in 
the summer and has been admitted to hospital for investigation and 
treatment.’

The Queen is being kept informed of his condition. It is not yet known if she will visit him.

It is the third time in eight months 
that the Duke has needed hospital treatment. He was in Papworth 
Hospital, Cambridge, for four nights over Christmas after successful 
heart surgery to clear a blocked coronary artery.

'Precaution': The Duke's visit to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary comes after he suffered a bladder infection during the Diamond Jubilee celebrations

In March Prince Harry said the 
operation – in which a stent was inserted – had given his grandfather ‘a
new spurt of life’. But in June he was forced to miss some of the 
Diamond Jubilee celebrations after contracting a bladder infection.

He spent five nights in King Edward 
VII hospital after being taken there by ambulance the day after he and 
the Queen braved the elements for four hours during the rain-soaked 
Jubilee pageant on the Thames.

Doctors said the demanding event had 
not caused the infection, but the cold and wet conditions, combined with
not drinking enough and infrequent visits to the lavatory while on the 
Royal Barge, could have contributed to his illness.

Despite his age the Duke still 
undertakes many public engagements. He was at the Queen’s side during 
the opening ceremony of the Olympics on July 27 and again the following 
day when they toured the Olympic Park.

The Duke was seen at the Games again 
on July 29, for his granddaughter Zara Phillips’s Olympic debut, and was
at the ExCel exhibition centre a few days later to watch the boxing.

He travelled to Scotland earlier this 
month and continued to support the Queen at engagements, including 
hosting a tea party for 3,000 guests at Balmoral last week to mark the 
end of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

He then travelled to the Isle of Wight
for Cowes Week in his role as Admiral and member of the Royal Yacht 
Squadron. On Monday, he attended a luncheon at Newport’s Chamber of 
Commerce and then visited stove manufacturer A.J Wells and Sons before 
dinner at the Pavilion in Cowes.

Jubilee: Prince Philip was taken to hospital with a bladder infection days after River Pageant in June

Dedicated: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh stood throughout four hours of wind and rain 

On Tuesday he viewed the yacht races 
in the Solent before attending a luncheon on the yacht My Farragon, 
accompanied by local dignitaries.

Onlookers said he appeared to be 
relaxed and in good spirits during the visits, but the engagements and 
the lengthy journeys between the South Coast and Scotland may have 
placed an added strain on his health.

The Queen’s husband of 64 years has 
always enjoyed good health and most of his past ailments have been 
sports-related. Before undergoing heart surgery at Christmas his most 
recent illness had been a cold in October last year, which forced him to
pull out of an overnight stay in Italy.

All smiles: Prince Philip smiled and waved after leaving hospital in June after his bladder infection

One of his most serious bouts of ill 
health came in 2008 when he was admitted to hospital in London with a 
chronic chest infection.

Earlier this year the Duke, who is 
linked to more than 800 organisations, announced plans to scale back on 
all but his most important patronages, in the first nod he has given to 
his age.

But he still carries out more than 350 engagements a year, making him one of the hardest working members of the Royal Family.
