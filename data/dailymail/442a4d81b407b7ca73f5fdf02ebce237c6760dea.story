The last survivor of Bangladesh's devastating Primark factory collapse burned to death after rescuers sparked a fire with the very power tools they were using to free her, it has emerged.

The unnamed woman, who had survived for five days since the garment factory caved in last Wednesday in the country's capital Dhaka, had captured the hearts of the millions of Bangladeshis watching the drama unfold on television.

When most had given up hope of finding anyone alive in the rubble, a faint voice was heard echoing from the darkness, triggering a massive rescue effort to free her from the twisted mass of metal and concrete.

But the 11-hour battle to bring her 
to safety ended in tragedy when sparks from firefighters' cutting 
machines set light to surrounding debris, pumping acrid smoke into the 
cavity.

Smell of death: A body is carried out from the garment factory building that collapsed Wednesday

Hunt over: Rescue team digging inside of the building and searching for survivors. So far, 380 have been confirmed dead

As the flames and smoke grew, firefighters were forced to abandon the dig until the fire had been doused.

Many were seen weeping among the rubble on television as news of her death filtered throughout the rescue operation.

Fading hope: Relatives show pictures of loved ones still not accounted for at the garment factory in the desperate hope some may still be found alive

'The fire broke out as we were cutting a beam to bring out what we believe was the last remaining survivor from the collapsed building. We managed to douse it, but as we came back we saw her dead,' the country’s fire chief Ahmed Ali said.

At least 380 people were killed when 
the illegally constructed, eight-storey Rana Plaza collapsed in a heap 
on Wednesday morning along with thousands of workers in the five garment
factories in the building. About 2,500 survivors have been accounted 
for.

Emergency crews have now given up hope of finding any more survivors in the rubble as they began using heavy machinery to remove the rubble and look for bodies, an official said.

The building owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana, was arrested on Sunday in the western border town of Benapole while he was trying to flee to India.

But despite the spectre of death looming over the site, there was one glimmer of hope as a woman miraculously gave birth while trapped beneath the mound of broken concrete and metal.

Police say as many as 900 people are still missing in the aftermath of the collapse. This woman is one of nine survivors who were pulled from the rubble today

The collapse was the deadliest 
disaster to hit the garment industry in Bangladesh that is worth 20 
billion dollars (£12.8 billion) annually, supplies global retailers and 
is a mainstay of the economy.

Volunteers, army personnel and firemen
have worked around the clock since Wednesday, mostly using hands and 
light equipment to pull out survivors. At around midnight on Sunday, 
authorities deployed hydraulic cranes and heavy cutting machines to 
break up the massive slabs of concrete into manageable segments that 
could be lifted away.

'We are proceeding cautiously. If 
there is still a soul alive, we will try to rescue that person,' said 
army spokesman Shahinul Islam.

'There is little hope of finding 
anyone alive. Our men went inside and saw some dead bodies in the ground
floor. But no one was seen alive,' said Brig Gen Ali Ahmed Khan, the 
chief of the fire brigade at the scene.

Prime minister Sheikh Hasina visited 
the site and a nearby hospital to meet with survivors on Monday, the 
first time since the disaster.

Hasina had ordered the arrest of 
building owner Rana, who is a small-time political operative from her 
Awami League party's youth wing. He was brought back by helicopter from 
the border town to the capital, Dhaka, where he is expected to be 
charged with negligence on Monday.

He had permission to build a 
five-storey building but added three more illegally. He last appeared in
public on Tuesday in front of the Rana Plaza after huge cracks appeared
in the building.

Witnesses said Rana assured tenants 
that the building was safe. Police, however, ordered an evacuation. A 
bank and some first-floor shops closed, but managers of the garment 
factories on the upper floors told workers to continue their shifts.

Hours later, the Rana Plaza was reduced to rubble, crushing most victims under massive blocks of concrete.

Police have also arrested four owners 
of three factories. Also in detention for questioning are two municipal 
engineers who were involved in approving the building's design. Local TV
stations reported that the Bangladesh High Court has frozen the bank 
accounts of the owners of all five garment factories.

Also
under detention are the wife of the building owner who is on the run 
and two government engineers who were involved in giving approval for 
the building design.

The owner had the approval to construct five floors but he added three more illegally.

A
huge crack appeared in the building, Rana Plaza, on Tuesday, but the 
owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana, assured tenants it was safe to go inside.

A
bank and some shops on the first floor shut their premises on Wednesday
after police ordered an evacuation, but managers of the garment 
factories on the upper floor told workers to continue their shifts.

Hours later the Rana Plaza was 
reduced to rubble, and most victims were crushed by massive blocks of 
concrete and mortar falling on them.

Working round-the-clock, rescuers 
have used bare hands and shovels, passing chunks of brick and concrete 
down a human chain away from the collapsed structure.

On
the ground, mixed in the debris were several pairs of pink cotton 
pants, a mud-covered navy blue sock and a pile of green uncut fabric.

Owners of the collapsed Rana Plaza garment factory are led away by police. Police have made a total of six arrests including engineers who designed the building

Some people have survived five days in the wreckage with no food or water but 900 are counted as missing

Soldiers clear away the crumbled concrete of the Rana Plaza building. Fears are mounting that the death toll could rise far beyond the latest figure of 363

The
badly decomposed bodies pulled out of the rubble were kept at a 
makeshift morgue at the nearby Adharchandra High School before being 
handed over to families.

A garment manufacturers' group said 
the factories in the building employed 3,122 workers, but it was not 
clear how many were inside when it fell. About 2,500 survivors have been
accounted for.

The death toll surpassed a fire five 
months ago that killed 112 people and brought widespread pledges to 
improve worker-safety standards. But since then, very little has changed
in Bangladesh.

The collapse and previous disasters in
garment factories have focused attention on the poor working conditions
of workers who toil for as little as 38 dollars (£24) a month to 
produce clothing for top international brands.

Its garment industry was the third-largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy, having grown rapidly in the past decade.

Among the garment makers in the 
building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style 
and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, 
trousers and other garments a year.

The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers.

Britain's Primark acknowledged it was 
using a factory in Rana Plaza, but many other retailers distanced 
themselves from the disaster, saying they were not involved with the 
factories at the time of the collapse or had not recently ordered 
garments from them.

Wal-Mart said none of its clothing had
been authorised to be made in the facility, but it is investigating 
whether there was any unauthorised production.
