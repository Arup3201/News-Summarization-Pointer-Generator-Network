On the evening of June 2, 1993, flushed with the joy of having finished my final exams in history, and by several celebratory glasses of wine, I took it upon myself to stand up in one of the dining rooms of my Oxford college — in front of a number of Fellows — and burst into song.

Among the audience were the nation’s future  bankers and barristers, plus a fellow  history undergraduate who would one day become Chancellor of the Exchequer: George Osborne.

Dressed in a suit and a dark green tie, my voice echoing around the wood panelling of that beautiful room in Magdalen College, I launched into the egomaniac’s hymn to self-indulgence, My Way.

‘And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain ...’ It seemed a fitting song with which to salute my last days among old friends at a much-loved institution.

But that wasn’t why I chose My Way. It wasn’t the song I liked, but the singer. Many people know My Way as a Frank Sinatra tune, but for me it was the version sung by Elvis Presley that had my heart.

I carefully imitated his precise, much-rehearsed cadences, his pauses and that deep, Mississippi-meets-Tennessee accent. By then, I knew it so very well.

Though my books have included a 
treatise on Latin and a reflection on British architecture, my latest is
 on what has been perhaps my greatest passion: Elvis.

From
 the age of six, my life orbited around him. In 1978, I stumbled on my 
first Elvis record, buried in a stack of my parents’ LPs — otherwise 
classical — behind the telly in my North London childhood home.

Obsessions don’t spring to life fully 
formed. Elvis began as a mild interest, a glimpse of something that only
 later hooked deeply into me. I liked Elvis; I didn’t yet love him.

As I grew up, I cast aside other childish things, but the interest in Elvis kept growing steadily for  a decade.

In my early adolescence, I moved on to more fashionable singers, such as Jimi Hendrix and — I admit it — The Smiths.

Back then, I liked to think that listening to them was an act of rebellion, but, as with most teenage fads, these bands were conventional, drawn from a handful of supposedly edgy groups, which were, in fact, sanctioned by everyone else in my set.

Towards the end of my time at school, as I grew more confident and was prepared to be a little different, I put aside those fads and returned to Elvis.

Then my real obsession began — created by the unique combination of his name, looks and extraordinary voice.

What I wanted more than anything was to visit Graceland, Elvis’s home in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1991, aged 19 and during my holidays from Oxford, I arranged to spend a summer in America.

Today, 23 years on, I still remember the ecstatic thrill as the tourist minibus crossed Elvis Presley Boulevard and rolled through Graceland’s gates, twisted into the shape of musical notes and a pair of wrought iron Elvises brandishing guitars.

The bus halted outside the portico, where we were met by an English tour guide, an undergraduate at Loughborough University.

Like me, he had been allowed to work 
in America thanks to a student visa. His job seemed far more enviable 
than mine, working for a conservative think-tank in Washington DC.

I
 remember the real, burning jealousy I felt for that tour guide. It 
intensified that evening when I bumped into him in a diner near my motel
 in suburban Memphis.

‘Do 
you get to go upstairs?’ I asked, trying to mask my excitement. Upstairs
 — banned to visitors — was Elvis’s bedroom and the bathroom he died in.
 Was he allowed into Elvis’s parents’ room, then still lived in by 
Elvis’s aunt, Delta Presley Biggs?

‘Afraid
 not,’ he said. ‘That’s for family only. Not sure I’d be that interested
 anyway, I’m not really an Elvis fan.’ Not an Elvis fan! The blind fool 
had the best job in the world. These days, I’m obsessed with politics — 
but I’d have swapped my political job with his in a heartbeat.

I was captivated not only by the King’s music, but his story; a combination of fairytale and tragedy, straight out of Hollywood.

Dream: What Harry wanted more than anything was to visit Graceland, Elvis's home in Memphis, Tennessee

There was the dirt-poor boy who became
 rich beyond his wildest dreams; the dangerous rebel who outraged the 
country, then joined the army; the sex symbol who only had eyes for his 
mother.

The divine Adonis 
who became a fat wreck; the good ole southern white boy who never 
uttered a racist word; the anti-drugs campaigner hooked on prescription 
drugs; the global superstar who barely left America.

Over the years of my obsession, I built something close to an Elvis shrine in my childhood bedroom.

My
 holy relics included a green tin Elvis Presley Boulevard road sign; a 
1987 black and gold baseball cap, commemorating the tenth anniversary of
 his death; a Sun Records T-shirt; and a copy of the outsize, 
gold-plated sunglasses worn by Elvis in the studio when he recorded 
Always On My Mind, only a few weeks after his 1972 separation from his 
wife, Priscilla. That, incidentally, was the song I chose to sing in 
Graceland’s recording booth, on my visit there in 1991.

I
 have never worn the gold sunglasses (in company, anyway) and I wonder 
now why on earth I bought them — or, for that matter, the ceramic Elvis 
White Christmas pot pourri holder that dangled over my bedroom window 
for several years in the late Eighties.

Only the most extreme popular music obsessives go in for this sort of thing.

The King: Elvis Presley performing on the Elvis Comeback TV Special in June 1968

How many classical music enthusiasts own a Vienna street sign commemorating the house where Brahms died in 1897? Can you buy Elgar pot pourri holders at the Last Night Of The Proms?

I’ve stopped acquiring memorabilia. A decade ago, in the build-up to birthdays and Christmas, I laid down a diktat to friends and family: ‘No Elvis-related presents, please.’

It wasn’t that I had gone off him; more I began to wonder why liking someone’s voice meant you should want to own a pot pourri holder with his face on it.

While my attitude to Elvis changed over the years, he hadn’t. Through the years of my obsession, he’d been lying dead in the Tennessee earth. (His coffin was moved from Forest Hills Cemetery in Memphis to Graceland two months after he died on August 16, 1977, to escape grave-robbing fans.)

That’s the funny thing about being a fan. Once you’ve fixated on your subject, whether it’s a pop star, football player or Renaissance painter, they remain immutable, though as years slip by, you may fall in and out of love with them.

I only really stopped being obsessed with him in the summer of 2005, at the age of 33, when I moved to Manhattan as the New York correspondent for a British newspaper.

Familiarity with America — and a second visit to Graceland — meant some of the glamour evaporated.

In the words of Elvis’s old Memphis friend, BB King, had the thrill gone?

Well, not entirely. I still get a residual buzz when I find that others share my affection for the King.

In a recent interview, Joanna Lumley chose Elvis as her pin-up because, as she put it, he ‘always calls people “sir” and “ma’am”. Sex appeal and manners — wow!’

I’ve always liked Joanna Lumley; I like her even more now.

These days, I don’t read books by Elvis’s old hairdresser, as I once did, nor do I buy any more Elvis-related goods.

The Elvis Presley Boulevard road sign is relegated to the bathroom. The pot pourri holder is no longer on public display — but it is in a drawer somewhere; I couldn’t bring myself to throw it away.

Middle age has swept away the tendency to obsession that crops up in lots of teenagers — whether for Justin Bieber, Star Wars figures or Commonwealth stamps.

The devotion to your chosen object is real enough at the time.

But the fanaticism is also a safe refuge from the harrowing worries of adolescence, teenage shyness or a romantic void.

In my case, middle age may not have killed off all my shyness or entirely filled that void, but it has mercifully smoothed away the extremes of my obsession.

These days, Elvis is only sometimes on my mind.
