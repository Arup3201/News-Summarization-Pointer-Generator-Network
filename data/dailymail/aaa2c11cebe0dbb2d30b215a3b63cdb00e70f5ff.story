Social media: Prisoner Glenn Knight has been updating Facebook while he is in prison serving a sentence for drug trafficking

A drug trafficker has boasted online of his cushy life in jail, telling how he watches hours of television and plays computer games.

Glenn Knight, 26, used an illegally acquired mobile phone to brag on Facebook that his four-and-a-half- year sentence was ‘flying by’.

He posted messages from his cell, saying he watches so much TV that he has turned into a ‘soap nerd’.

The inmate, from Wallasey, Merseyside,
nicknamed 'Glendog' also joked
about 'staying in tonight' as it was 'too cold to go outside'. He also 
said he hoped to move to an even cushier life at Category D open jail.

In
one message, greeted with delight by several Facebook friends a day 
after he was sentenced, Knight boasted: 'Another night in for me - or 
should I say another year haha.'

Knight was jailed for his role in a 16-strong gang which smuggled drugs in what police called a ‘sophisticated criminal enterprise’.

Laboratories were set up two industrial units in Blackpool so he could store preparing and mixing large quantities of drugs.

Gang members fearing they were being 
watched by police would regularly ditch mobile phones and change their 
cars in a bid to throw detectives off the scent.

But during the raids officers seized over five kilos of cocaine with a street value in excess of £550,000.

Over
30 kilos of mephedrone with a street value in excess of £300,000 was 
confiscated along with 125 kilo bags of previously used packaging 
containing mephedrone with a street value of £1.5 million.

Over 15 kilos of amphetamine worth in excess of £150,000 was also seized along with two kilos of skunk cannabis worth £25,000.

Officers also found mixing tubs, a heat sealing machine and other equipment after raiding the two industrial units.

In all the raids along the Lancashire coast, officers seized total haul of cocaine, mephedrone, amphetamine and skunk cannabis with a combined street value of more than £2.5million.

Soap nerd: Knight lets his followers know about his love of programmes like Coronation Street, Eastenders and Emmerdale

Gamer: Knight also spoke of playing computer games as he serves his time

When friends on Facebook asked how he was faring 
in prison, Knight, replied: ‘I’m really good. 
Just chilling, watching me soaps – bang up to date on them all – haha.

'Won’t be 2 long now – done nearly a year already – its [sic] flew. Can’t believe how quick its [sic] gone.’

Yesterday
his Facebook page was taken down after the Ministry of  Justice was 
alerted. Mobile phones are banned in prisons and Knight will face 
disciplinary action from prison chiefs and possibly a police investigation into how he acquired the phone.

He
was arrested in July 2012 and held on remand until being sentenced last
Friday after admitting charges including conspiracy to  supply class A 
and B drugs.

Unbeknown 
to the judge, he was posting messages while waiting for his case.

He now faces further action from prison chiefs and possibly a police investigation into how he acquired the phone

He announced his arrival online by saying he was about to play the computer game Pro Evolution Soccer 2008. He wrote: 'Just had the best visit today, mum nan grandad are amazing. Now back to smash Pes 2008 Haha.'

When his friends expressed surprise he was online, Knight added: 'Yep mate and in its the new Playstation2 haha.' He went on: 'Can get online now and again - aint been on for ages. Haha dat game was built into computer already.'

Not all bad: Knight says his time in prison is 'flying' and hopes he can be transferred to a more comfortable category D jail

Other friends posted messages asking how Knight was and he said: 'Thanks I’m really good. Glendog is fine mate. Just chilling, watching me soaps - bang up to date on them all - haha. Won’t be 2 long now - done nearly a year already - its flew.

'Can’t believe how quick its gone. Thought it would have dragged but it hasn’t. Only feels like a few months.'

He admitted he was now a ‘soap nerd’ adding; 'Corri, Easties, Emmerdale, Hollyoaks, Home and Away, Neighbours - that’s what you call a soap nerd and I’m proud of it.'

'If I wasn’t before, I defo am now.'

Jokes: Knight makes quips about his incarceration

He claimed: 'Alright 15 months left and done a year already - should have only got three and a half at the very most. Just need to get Cat D now.

In a string of responses friends of Knight said: 'Too funny mate', 'good on ya son', ‘Love ye Glen boy,' and 'I’ll have a pint for ya to celebrate'.

But today a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'The Justice Secretary has made clear that it is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social networking sites.

'Those who break the rules will be dealt with severely, and no prisoner should be in any doubt that if they are found with a mobile phone or any other illicit items they will be stripped of their privileges and reported to the police for further action.

'The Facebook page in question has been removed.'
