Andrew Marr has branded Jeremy Paxman as a ‘genuinely tortured, angry individual’.

The BBC presenter said Mr Paxman, 64, was barely able to hide his disdain for those he interviews – and that it had been a mistake to allow him to grill David Cameron and Ed Miliband last Thursday.

Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Marr argued the former Newsnight host’s aggressive interviews were ‘not a good replacement’ for debate between the Prime Minister and the Labour leader.

The interviews, on Channel 4 and Sky, were conducted separately and followed weeks of negotiations between broadcasters and political parties over the format.

‘The thing about Jeremy is that he is a genuinely tortured, angry individual – and you get the real Jeremy,’ Mr Marr said. ‘He looks disdainful and contemptuous and furious with his guests because he by and large is. You can’t fake these things on television.’

However, Mr Marr, 55, suggested Mr Paxman had forgotten why the leader interviews were being televised and had allowed his own ego to get in the way.

‘No disrespect to Jeremy Paxman, but it would have been a lot more interesting had it been head to head,’ he said. ‘Replacing that with a good “Paxmaning” for both of them, while entertaining, was not a good replacement.

‘There is a danger for all of us, as it were, in the interviewer’s chair to forget that we are not the ones standing for election.

‘And I thought Ed Miliband did score [in the interview] when he said, “Jeremy, you’re important, but you’re not that important”.’

Mr Marr, a former colleague of Mr Paxman, said it had been a mistake to allow the former Newsnight presenter to  grill Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband last Thursday for the election debate

A number of television critics said Mr Paxman dominated the show so strongly that viewers might have finished wanting to vote for him rather than either of the party leaders.

However, Mr Marr’s comments went down badly with viewers, who accused the BBC political editor of being ‘supine’, ‘sycophantic’ and having an ‘inflated sense of his own importance’.

Others speculated Mr Marr’s remarks were driven by jealousy.

The two men spent nearly 15 years as colleagues at the BBC, until Mr Paxman quit last year. But they have had relatively little to do with each other.

Mr Paxman hosted a series of documentaries and fronted BBC2’s flagship current affairs programme, Newsnight.

Mr Marr, who started out as a newspaper journalist, has spent the past decade at the helm of BBC1’s Sunday current affairs programme, The Andrew Marr Show. He also fronts BBC Radio 4’s Start The Week each Monday.

A BBC source said executives were ‘very surprised’ by Mr Marr’s outburst, as the two men never really ‘trod on each other’s toes’ even when they worked together.

But Mr Marr made it clear he prefers a friendlier approach than the aggressive line of attack for which Mr Paxman is renowned.

‘I have never believed that the right approach to a political interview is to say to the interviewee, in effect, “You’re a scoundrel, you’re a liar, and I’m going to treat you like that”,’ he said on Friday. ‘The best I can do is to ask intelligent questions, keep eye contact – intelligent, sensible questions that the alert viewer would want to be asked.

‘And if they’re not answered, ask them again. And if they’re not answered then, just make it clear to everybody that X or Y has not answered the question and move on.

Viewers have accused Mr Marr, who has hosted BBC1's Sunday-morning current affairs programme for the past decade, of being ‘supine’, ‘sycophantic’ and having an ‘inflated sense of his own importance’

‘We don’t have to be this kind of really, really aggressive opposition all of the time.’

Mr Paxman is known for doggedly pursuing a line of attack, once asking then home secretary Michael Howard the same question 12 times in a row.

That aggression was clear last Thursday when he took Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband to task, in two separate interviews.

The Prime Minister was asked to defend soaring immigration, whether he could live on a zero-hours contract, and made to squirm over his close ties with former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson. Mr Miliband’s grilling was so severe the presenter asked him at the end: ‘Are you OK, Ed? Are you all right?’

However, when Mr Paxman told the Labour leader his party would never get a majority, Mr Miliband said the broadcaster does not get to decide who wins.
