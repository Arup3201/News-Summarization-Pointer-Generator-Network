The family of a Georgia man who had Alzheimers and was shot dead in the middle of the night as he knocked on the door of a house, have spoken of their heartbreak that the person who carried out the shooting will not face criminal charges.

Joe Hendrix, 35, fatally shot 72-year-old Ronald Westbrook on November 27 last year.

The elderly man had slipped from his home as early as 1 a.m. and wandered in the cold and dark for hours until randomly approaching the home of Hendrix's fiancee on a rural cul-de-sac, repeatedly knocking on the door and ringing the bell.

Hendrix's fiancee called 911, while Hendrix grabbed his .40-caliber handgun, went outside and confronted Westbrook in the dark. Hendrix told police that he fired four shots after Westbrook ignored commands to stop, identify himself and raise his hands.

Heartbroken: Ron Westbrook with his family. His family are struggling to come to terms with his death and are furious that charges will not be brought to the man who shot him dead

Mistaken: Ret. Lt. Col. Ronald Westbrook, 72, who suffered from Alzheimer's Disease was shot in the early morning hours of November 27, 2013. Joe Hendrix who shot him will face no criminal charges. Henderix mistook Westbrook for an intruder when Westbrook tried to enter the home of Hendrix's fiancee just before 4 a.m.

District Attorney Herbert 'Buzz' Franklin's office characterized the incident as a 'tragic shooting death' in a written statement. Franklin did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Mr Westbrook's 26-year-old granddaughter, Kimberly Westbook, made her feelings clear on her Facebook page.

'You can get away with anything if you claim you were scared,' Ms. Westbrook said refelecting on the county prosecutors' decision  not to press charges against Hendrix.  'It's Heartbreaking. I've barely stopped crying since I heard the news,' she continued.

'I'm a little upset,' said Deanne Westbrook, the slain man's widow. She said she felt police and prosecutors had done a thorough job. 'I really wanted to see it go before a grand jury, and then maybe before a jury. But they tell me there's not enough evidence for that.'

Hendrix appreciated the care and deliberation shown by investigators, said his attorney, Lee Davis

'Mr. Hendrix fully acknowledges the loss to Westbrook family, and his thoughts and prayers are with them,' Davis said in a statement.

A series of chance events, even a missed opportunity, preceded the shooting.

On Nov. 19, Hendrix's fiancee called 911 just before midnight to report that a man carrying a piece of paper and a flashlight rang her doorbell and wanted to see a person whose name she did not recognize, according to Hendrix's attorney and police reports obtained by The Associated Press under the state's open records laws. The woman had only recently moved into the rented home and was suspicious, Davis said previously.

Worried, the fiancee called Hendrix, who told her to call 911. By the time Hendrix and police officers arrived, the suspicious man was gone. Afterward, Hendrix, a former soldier, took a handgun from his apartment in nearby Chattanooga, Tenn., and brought the weapon to his fiancee's home.

About a week later, Westbrook slipped out unnoticed from the home he shared with his wife of 51 years. Westbrook suffered from Alzheimer's, a progressive disease that causes memory loss, impairs judgment and can leave it victims disoriented. His widow, Deanne, previously said her husband had become confused about where he lived and struggled to identify those closest to him.

Tragic: Ronald Westbrook, who had Alzheimer's, was shot dead as he tried to get into a stranger's home

On
 November 19 a stranger appears at the  home Joe Hendrix's fiancee is 
renting at about midnight and begins demanding to speak to the previous 
tenant.

Frightened and home alone with two children, she calls Mr Hendrix and police but the man disappears before they arrive.

On November 27, Ronald Westbrook slips out of the house he shares with his wife of 51 years and goes for a walk with his dogs.

At
 about 2.20am police stop Mr Westbrook when they see him standing by the
 road holding mail. He tells them he lives nearby and they leave him 
alone.

At 4am Mr Hendrix and his fiancee are woken by the sound of someone ringing their doorbell and trying to get inside.

As his fiancee calls 911 Mr Hendrix takes his pistol and goes outside to confront the stranger.

When
 Mr Westbrook fails to respond when Mr Hendrix calls out to him, the 
34-year-old fires, hitting the Alzheimer's sufferer in the chest.

No
 charges have been filed. Under Georgia's Stand Your Ground law 
homeowners are allowed to use lethal force if they feel threatened.

She said she installed alarms on her doors to prevent her husband from wandering, but she didn't hear them when he left with the couple's two dogs, possibly as early as 1 a.m.

His night time ramblings led him to 
the porch of Joe Hendrix, 34, who had recently moved to the property and
 had already been spooked by strangers hammering on the door.

As
 Mr Hendrix's financee called 911 the 34-year-old confronted the 
stranger outside his house and, when Mr Westbrook walked towards the 
house without identifying himself, Mr Hendrix fired.

When police arrived Mr Westbrook was dead, with his beloved rottweiler standing guard over his body.

'I can't imagine him feeling threatened by my husband, that's what surprises me,' Mrs Westbrook said. 

'I think he was so cold. He was looking 
for help when he was ringing that doorbell at their place. I think he 
just wanted somebody to help him.'

Her
 husband, a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force had taken 
to collecting other people's mail as part of his deterioration from 
Alzheimer's. 

A deputy sheriff noticed Westbrook 
walking along a road around 2:30 a.m. and stopped to question him, 
Walker County Steve Wilson said previously. Westbrook told the officer 
that he was getting his mail — he was near mailboxes — and then planned 
to return home. Nothing about the conversation alarmed the officer.

Devoted: When police arrived at the shooting, Ronald Westbrook's rottweiler was standing guard over his body

Just before 4 a.m., Hendrix and his fiancee woke up to barking dogs and realized someone was ringing their doorbell, knocking on their door and trying to get in, police said. Hendrix's fiancee called 911 while Hendrix went outside with his gun.

Sheriff Steve Wilson, who knew the victim, 
paid tribute to his friend who used to play trumpet in the church 
orchestra. He added that in recent years, although he appeared fit, he 
was struggling with the onset of Alzheimer's.

'Physically
 he was in good shape, you would never know anything was wrong with 
him,' Sheriff Wilson said.  'But he had gotten to the point where he 
wouldn’t say much, he had trouble thinking of the right words to say. 
That may have been why he didn’t respond [to Mr Hendrix].'

'I never would have thought he would've [come] to an end like this. I was prepared for the Alzheimer's to get 
worse and for me to take care of him here. And I was going to do it,' Mrs Westbrook said. 

'I understand the man who shot him is
 real upset, and I think he should be,' she added. 'He shot an innocent 
man. He should have stayed in the house like a normal person would. He took the life of a real gentle man, and it's a crying shame.'
