A young mother has admitted she considered murdering her three-week-old daughter while in the grip of post-natal depression.

At her lowest point, Suzi Wood, who has since recovered, even planned exactly how she would kill her daughter Annabelle.

But now the 21-year-old, who lives in Huntington, near Cannock, Staffordshire, has fully recovered from the illness thanks to counselling and is an ambassador for charity PANDAS (Pre- and Post-Natal Depression Advice and Support).

Suzi Wood, 21, who has recovered from post-natal depression, has admitted she thought about killing her baby daughter Annabel while in the grip of the illness

She is appealing for volunteers to come forward to start support groups across the West Midlands to help other mothers beat post-natal depression.

Single mother Suzi, who shares care of seven-month-old Annabelle with her parents Sam and Pete, said: 'There were so many things that post-natal depression did to me. 

'I wanted to physically kill Annabelle when she was about three weeks old. I even planned how to do it.

'I convinced myself she wasn't mine and I wanted my parents to adopt her. I wanted to go out and get drunk and forget I was a mother.

Single mother Suzi, who shares care of seven-month-old Annabelle with her parents Sam and Pete, explained that her parents pretty much had to take care of Annabelle, known as Belle, 24/7 because they were scared she'd hurt her

'I had to pretend to the outside world that everything was OK. My parents pretty much had to take care of Belle 24/7 because they were scared I'd hurt her.

'I didn't tell people what was going on in my head until one day Belle was crying and I just cracked up and broke down. I just couldn't do it anymore.

'I didn't want to give her a bottle because I felt I didn't love her and I didn't want her.'

Counselling helped Suzi recover and bond with her daughter and she now plans to return to education to study psychology counselling to help other sufferers and mentor young adults.

She said: 'I started counselling in January, as I had to wait a while for an appointment, and I was discharged after a course of 4 sessions instead of 8.

'I decided, with help from PANDAS that PND didn't "have" me and that I would take control. I'd suffered with depression for years beforehand but never to this stage. I needed serious help at this point.

'I've been given this beautiful life to take care of and provide for and I couldn't do it with PND taking over.

'I've had 
so much help from my parents, who are both disabled, and we would be 
lost without them. Involving family can be very hard, more so if they 
don't understand how you think or feel.

'I had to 
take time out a few nights a week to relax, so, luckily I had help from 
my parents. I used a mix of Emotional Freedom Technique and counselling 
skills to overcome this illness. I spoke to other parents from 
CreateChurch:Cannock who have also given me a great deal of support.

'This 
journey has not been easy and many mothers and fathers still suffer 
today. It's vital we raise awareness for this, and PANDAS, in order to 
offer support for such a silent illness.'

There are 
only three PANDAS support groups across the West Midlands - and none in 
the Birmingham area - and Suzi is calling for women to come forward to 
start groups in the region.

She said: 'We want people to know that it is OK not to be OK. If there are people who have recovered from post-natal depression in the Birmingham area who would like to help others by starting a support group, PANDAS would love to hear from them.'

The charity provides a free starter pack and other assistance to help volunteers set up support groups.

Anyone who wants to start a group or needs help coping with post-natal depression can contact PANDAS on 0843 2898401 or see www.pandasfoundation.org.uk

Feeling 'low' after 
having a baby, also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is 
considered normal, but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much
 deeper and long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND).

Around 10-15 per cent of new mothers suffer from post-natal depression, but help is out there (file pic)

It
 usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on 
gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite
 severe.

Sufferers may feel sad or low, unable to
cope, and hostile or indifferent to their husband, partner or baby. They may have thoughts about death, be unable to sleep, and feel 
hopeless about the future.

Many
 of those who suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say
 that if PND is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and
 to be less severe.

Treatments
 for PND include counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, 
which can be very effective. Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also 
be offered for short-term use.

Some
 women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage,
 and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and 
anxiety.

Practical and 
emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a 
great help to those suffering from PND. Getting out to meet other 
parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and 
anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an 
antidepressant.

Organisations such as the Association for Post-Natal Illness
 provides a telephone helpline for women who believe they are suffering 
from PND and for medical professionals.  Call 0207 386 0868 
Monday-Friday 10am-2pm.

Another helpline for those suffering from pre or post-natal depression is run by Pre And Post-Natal Depression Advice and Support and is staffed 9am-8pm on 0843 28 98 401.

Other telephone helplines available 24 hours a day include Parentline on 0808 800 2222 or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90.
