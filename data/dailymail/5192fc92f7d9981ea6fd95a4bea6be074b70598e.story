Liverpool scouts set to run rule over Markovic again as Man United hoverÂ 

Newcastle United have opened preliminary talks with Tenerife over striker Ayoze Perez.

The 20-year-old has been watched by the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City, Arsenal, Everton and Swansea over the past 12 months and is considered a forward of good potential having scored 16 goals in 29 games this season in the Spanish second division.

Newcastle are looking for at least two strikers for next season with Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette still a possibility while they are also among clubs to have asked about taking Arsenal's Joel Campbell on loan after his impressive displays for Olympiacos in the Champions League.

Montpellier midfielder Remy Cabella remains a target for Newcastle while Manchester City defender Micah Richards is another Newcastle have an interest in.

Manchester United are to offer a week-long trial to Serbian goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic.

The 17-year-old has recently agreed a new deal with FK Vojvodina but they are happy to let him visit United with the prospect of a decent fee should he impress. Milinkovic-Savic is due to arrive next Wednesday, April 16. He is also attracting interest from Spanish clubs.

Fulham coach Felix Magath is keen on Wolfsburg left back Ricardo Rodriguez should he manage to stay in the Premier League.

Rodriguez, 21, has been watched by Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United scouts this season as they all search for left backs for next season.

However, although the Switzerland defender has continued to impress they have moved on to other targets at this stage. Wolfsburg may look to sell after the World Cup in June when they hope his value increases and Magath hopes he will be in a position to bid.

Fiorentina have firmed up their interest in Tottenham defender Younes Kaboul.

The 28-year-old has one more year left on contract and is weighing up his options with Sevilla also keen to take him.

Fiorentina are keen to offer a three-year contract if they can get prise him out of Tottenham on a relatively cheap deal.

Sevilla are looking at options to replace Federico Fazio who has been watched by Everton several times this season. The 27-year-old Argentinian centre back has also come under consideration at Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United.

Leeds United are monitoring Southend goalkeeper Daniel Bentley.

The 20-year-old, who stands at 6ft 4in tall, has impressed with his performances in League Two this season and Leeds see potential in him to become a top player.

England keeper Jack Butland will return to Stoke City at the end of this season and there remain question marks over the future of Paddy Kenny. Plenty of activity is expected at Leeds over he coming months with owner Massimo Cellino looking to restructure the squad.

Jimmy Kebe will also return to Crystal Palace following his loan while Michael Brown, Danny Pugh and Paul Green are out of contract.

Blackpool are in talks over a summer deal for Dutch defender Tom Beugelsdijk. The 23-year-old centre back is out-of-contract with ADO Den Haag in the summer and is free to discuss terms with foreign clubs.

Beugelsdijk was at Blackpool's game with Derby County on Tuesday to see their 3-1 defeat and held discussions with club officials over a potential deal before returning to Holland.

West Ham, Hull and Genoa are showing tentative interest in Sunderland winger Emanuele Giaccherini.

The 28-year-old has only shown his ability in flashes this season and has been seen as something of an unnecessary luxury while Sunderland have been battling relegation.
