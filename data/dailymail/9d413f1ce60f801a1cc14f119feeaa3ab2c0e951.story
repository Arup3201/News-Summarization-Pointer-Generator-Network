Not charged: Torreano Batton, 18, is due back in adult court this afternoon for his arraignment after prosecutors asked for more time to make a decision

Five high school football players have been charged with the gang-rape of a 16-year-old girl after she was able to record part of her ordeal on her iPod.

Of the five underage boys, all aged between 16 and 17 and on the football team at Winter Springs High School in Seminole County, Florida, two are now being prosecuted as adults and three will face court as juveniles.

A sixth suspect, 18-year-old Torreano Batton, has not been charged but is due back in adult court this afternoon for his arraignment. The delay came after prosecutors asked for more time to make a decision, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

The six suspects were arrested last November after a 16-year-old girl told police they sexually assaulted her in woods close to Winter Springs High School.

She was allegedly raped by three of them as she walked from school to a nearby McDonald's through a small patch of woods on November 13. Batton and two others trapped her and refused to allow her to leave until she performed sex acts on each of them, prosecutors said.

Then, as she was leaving McDonald's, the suspects are alleged to have dragged her back into the woods where four of them forced her to perform sex acts. Two suspects assaulted her twice, she said.

The girl used her iPod to film part of what happened to her. The recording is said to show the suspects ordering her to perform sex acts and insisting she submit because it is one boy's 17th birthday.

According to a police report seen by the Orlando Sentinel: 'The males are circling her and appear to be trying to intimidate her into performing the acts and keeping her from leaving.'

The recording shows the victim answering 'No' and telling her attackers she wants to go back to school, the report says.

Two of the underage suspects denied being involved, while the other three insisted the sex was consensual. Batton also denied involvement.

If convicted, the three suspects charged as juveniles could be placed in a juvenile prison until they are 19 years old. The two juveniles charged as adults face a maximum of four years in the adult prison system as 'youthful offenders'.

Batton, if charged and found guilty as an adult, faces a potential maximum sentence of 30 years.

Four of the underage suspects are from Sanford and the fifth is from Winter Springs, where Batton is also from.

Batton was freed on a £35,000 bond after more than three weeks in jail, ordered to wear a GPS tag and to stay away from Winter Springs High School.
