We learn lots of bad habits from celebrities (how to get tangoed, why one layer of lashes is never enough) but the absolute worst in my eyes is breaking the speed limit when it comes to relationships.

Blink and you miss the courtship with people like Kerry Katona, Jordan and Tamara Eccelstone.

They’ve met, married and practically had babies in the time most normal people have gone on a few dates.

When we’re deep in the infatuation stage, all of us want to click our heels three times and whisk ourselves forward to the nice, safe, really committed bit.

We’re all guilty of wanting to believe this new person will be by our side forever and the temptation is to race toward the finish line.

My advice is don’t – for three good reasons.

First: you’ll miss out on all the gorgeous niceties newness provides (you don’t quite know if they feel the same way about you and when they confess they do and you both smile stupidly at each other, life’s wonderful). 

Second: it’s ridiculous to commit for life when you’ve only known them for a second of yours.

Third: if you push for intimacy before they’re ready, they may well run away.

Sometimes it’s both of you speeding ahead. You meet at a party on Saturday night, stay up talking till dawn, end up sharing breakfast, then watch the Sunday night movie snuggled in each other’s arms. The only thing that stops the marathon date, is having to go to work on Monday morning.

Tracey says that too much intimacy too fast can be a bad thing

It just has to be the start of something wonderful, right?

Not necessarily. Therapists say long-lasting first dates send our expectations soaring ridicu­lously high – and few relation­ships live up to them.

When the ‘magic’ wears off and real life creeps in, the affair fizzles out faster and leaves you feeling even more disillusioned than normal.

Women are often the ones who push for intimacy too quickly, probably because we’re so comfortable with it. Some women go out with their victim (yep, victim) once, then call him three times the next day, drag him around to meet Mum three dates in, book next year’s Valentine’s Day dinner on the fourth date and then wonder why the guy ran away so fast he left burn marks on the hallway carpet.

Here’s why: he figures if you’re this full-on in the beginning, you’ll strangle him with intimacy within a few months.

An astute guy also realizes wanting to be instantly committed isn’t a compliment. Some women want a relationship and don’t really care who it’s with.

You’ve also removed the mystery. He doesn’t have to lie in bed wondering if he’s really worthy of a girl like you because you’ve practically proposed already.

There are many studies that show the longer the courtship, the more likely it is a couple who marry will stay together.

In one study of couples who lived together before marriage, those who were now divorced had dated for around seven and a half months and lived together for 14 months before marrying.

The couples who were still married had dated for 20 months then lived together for 16 months before marrying.

So let’s all calm down, take a few deep breaths and think logically.

If you’re planning on spending the rest of your life with this person, you’ve got the rest of your life to move in, get married and/or have babies.
