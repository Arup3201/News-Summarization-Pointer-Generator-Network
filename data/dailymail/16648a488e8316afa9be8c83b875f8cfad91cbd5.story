Fourteen people died and 21 were injured in a horrific motorway accident in Salvador, Brazil, today.

A 48-ton tractor fell from a trailer as its driver took a bend on the BR-110 motorway, which bypasses the city of Inhambupe, Bahia, reports suggest.

The machine crashed head-on into the bus, which was coming in the opposite direction, killing 14.

The bus driver was among the dead.

A tractor crashed in to a bus in Inhambupe, Brazil, killing 14

The machine is thought to have fallen off a trailer and smashed head-on into the bus

Luggage and debris can be seen surrounding the scene of the crash - which took place earlier today

Valdir Cordeiro, from the transport police said: 'The tractor was being pulled on a carrier on the back of a lorry.

'As the driver rounded the bend the tractor fell off right into the path of a bus coming the other way.

'There was no time for the bus driver to brake or swerve as the tractor immediately collided with it.'

One passenger, who declined to be named, said he was asleep when the accident happened: 'I don’t know how this happened but I’m lucky to be alive.

'It’s probably because I was sitting on the opposite side of the bus which didn’t suffer the massive damage like the other side that took the full impact of the crash.'

The bus company Gonjito reported that 34 passengers were on the vehicle at the time of the accident along with the driver.

The coach was travelling from Sao Paulo to Paulo Afonso in Bahia, a 37 hour - three day journey and was a 104 miles from Salvador the Capital of Bahia.

'We had stopped not long before the accident happened and quite a number of people got off the bus,' reported an injured passenger, who lay on the ground as he spoke to the reporter from the local Brazilian newspaper Aragão.

'More people would have been killed if they hadn’t left then. They got away with their lives,' he added before being lifted into the ambulance and taken to hospital.

Police confirmed that 12 people had died at the scene and two in hospital from their injuries.

Gonjito said it would not disclose the names of the 21 casualties and the dead until they had managed to contact their families.

The Dantas Bião Hospital and the Alagoinhas Hospital where the wounded were taken reported on  Monday that the victims were suffering from major injuries and a number were in surgery. 

They refused to elaborate on the type of injuries and no further updates have been given on the state of their health.

The 43-year-old lorry driver who today was under arrest is said to have claimed to police that the tractor was tied to the trailer and he was unaware of what may have been the cause of the accident.

Observers at the scene who inspected the trailer pointed out that they could not see any straps, chains or securings that would have held the tractor in place.

Standing on the back of the trailer, one unnamed local said: 'There is nothing here to show that the tractor was secured. It looks like it was just put on top of the carrier and transported without anything holding it from coming off.'
