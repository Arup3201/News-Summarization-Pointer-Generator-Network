Appalling: Darren Leggett's 'catalogue' of paedophile abuse was branded 'about as depressing as it's possible to be'

A supermarket worker who was also the leader of an international paedophile ring raped children as young as five before trading videos of the horrific abuse online, a court heard today.

Darren Leggett, 32, raped his three victims - all aged under 13 - then made 36 harrowing films of the sickening abuse for others to see.

The paedophile's six-year campaign of abuse saw him create his own websites from his parents' house, which itself was just a short walk from a local primary school.

Leggett, branded simply 'wrong' by a judge, gave the clips disgusting titles and included one where he made horrendous boasts about having sex with a boy who did not know he was being filmed.

The sex offender was today jailed indefinitely, although his tariff will be a minimum of seven years.

Maidstone
Crown Court heard the quiet supermarket employee first came across the 
youngsters in the aisles of the store where he worked, then later gained
access to the children.

Leggett’s six-year campaign of abuse was only uncovered when a boy he abused told a teacher what had been happening to him.

The Internet Watch Foundation received an anonymous tip-off which then alerted child exploitation experts.

Undercover
police launched an online sting - dubbed Operation Cake - and Leggett, 
calling himself Ben, was caught after he contacted an officer, posing as
'JJ', and told him he was interested in having sex with children.

The court heard he had previously written depraved text messages boasting of his plans to 'rape and kill kids'.

Judge
Philip Statman, jailing Leggett, said the paedophile's attitude to 
children was abundantly clear on a websites where he stated: 'We are not
sickos, we just like children more than adult women or men. It is not 
wrong to like who you are. You are who you are.'

The judge told him: 'You have a distorted thought-pattern that leads to the view that sexual activity is a way of loving your victims. You are wrong.'

The judge said he had given anxious consideration as to whether he should impose a life sentence, but was just persuaded he should not.

He said: 'However, I am satisfied you represent a significant risk of committing further specified offences. Dangerousness is well and truly passed in the terms of the test in your case.'

Jailed: Leggett was given an indefinite prison term at Maidstone Crown Court, but will serve a minimum of seven years

Leggett, of Yalding, Kent, was convicted at Maidstone Crown Court on May 11 after pleading guilty to 31 offences including rape, sexual assault, arranging a child for a sexual offence, and for possessing and distributing indecent images of children.

Police uncovered the full extent of sexual abuse following a raid at his home, where a rucksack containing cannabis equipment, cable ties, a knife and 13 pairs of boys pants was also seized.

The sex pest despicably joked as he was handcuffed claiming he preferred 'pink fluffy ones'.

Crispian Cartwright, defending, described the offending as 'an absolutely lamentable catalogue and about as depressing to read as anything can be'.

He added: 'This is a man who through his own admission showed he was a paedophile. He faced up to it. He has the terrible misfortune to be cursed with paedophilia.'

Leggett will remain on the sex offenders’ register for life and be banned from working with children or vulnerable adults.

A sexual offences prevention order was imposed, also for life.
