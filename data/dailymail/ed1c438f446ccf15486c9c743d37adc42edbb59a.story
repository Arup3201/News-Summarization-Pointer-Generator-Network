Angela Merkel may be willing to sacrifice Greece in order to persuade German voters to bail out the euro, George Osborne warned last night.

The Chancellor suggested Germany may ‘require’ the crisis that would follow a Greek exit to convince its voters to take the unpalatable steps needed to rescue the single currency.

His comments came as the euro crisis continued to deepen, despite an £80billion bailout of Spain’s banks at the weekend.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel could be willing to make the sacrifice in order to demonstrate the importance of saving the single currency

Spain’s borrowing costs rose to a euro-era high of 6.8 percent yesterday after credit ratings agency Fitch brushed aside the rescue fund to issue a fresh downgrade to 18 Spanish banks.

Italy’s borrowing rates also jumped to dangerous levels after the Austrian finance minister suggested Italy – the eurozone’s third largest economy – would also need a bailout.

Economists have warned a Greek exit could plunge markets into fresh turmoil and spark a new recession across Europe.

Ministers and officials are drawing 
up contingency plans, including a draconian cap on cashpoint withdrawals
and limits on foreign travel, to deal with the potential fallout.

Chancellor George Osborne suggested that Mrs Merkel may require a Grexit to stave off discontent amongst German voters

But speaking at a business summit in London yesterday, Mr Osborne suggested Mrs Merkel may be prepared to allow Greece to leave the euro in order to demonstrate to German voters the need to take costly action to prevent the total collapse of the single currency.

International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde has previously called upon leaders to take 'decisive steps to break free of the crisis'

‘I ultimately don’t know whether Greece needs to leave the euro in order for the eurozone to do the things necessary to make their currency survive.’.

‘I just don’t know whether the German government requires Greek exit to explain to their public why they need to do certain things like a banking union, eurobonds and things in common with that.’

The Chancellor also described the failure of Spain’s bank bailout as ‘depressing’ and ‘frustrating’.

Treasury sources insisted Mr Osborne was not commenting on the likelihood of a Greek exit.

A source said: ‘His point was, do we need another crisis to get decisive action from the eurozone to stand behind its currency.’

Continuing market turmoil fuelled fears European leaders are nowhere near finding a solution to the financial storm that threatens to tear the single currency apart.

Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, urged leaders ‘to take decisive steps to break free of the crisis’.

Cyprus has indicated it is just days away from asking for a bailout of its own and Greek elections on Sunday could see angry voters push the country out of the euro.
