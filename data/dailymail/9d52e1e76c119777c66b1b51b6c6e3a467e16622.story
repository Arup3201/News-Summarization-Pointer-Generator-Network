Brendan Rodgers gave Mario Balotelli a helping hand in training as the misfiring striker bids to get back on the goal trail in Liverpool's trip to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.

Balotelli has found the net just once for his new club since joining at the end of August - against Ludogorets in the Champions League - and desperately needs to rediscover his goalscoring touch in the Premier League.

The Italian has scored with just one of his last 66 shots in Premier League action, over 21 games for Liverpool and former club Manchester City.

Rodgers was deep in conversation with the 24-year-old during Friday morning's training session at Melwood and dragged Balotelli back to his feet when he landed awkwardly on his backside during a shooting drill. 

The striker grimaced in pain when he got back to his feet but was soon back in the thick of the action.

One player absent from the session but expected to return at Loftus Road is Daniel Sturridge.

The forward suffered a thigh injury while on international duty with England in September and Liverpool have missed his goalscoring touch.

Before his injury, Liverpool had won two of their three matches and scored six goals. During his absence, they have won just two of seven games and scored only eight goals.

He played no part in the training session and Rodgers said a decision on his match fitness will be made on Saturday.

Sturridge's return will be a massive boost - he has 32 goals in 46 Premier League matches for Liverpool, twice as many as Luis Suarez had at this stage.

Rodgers said: 'We'll see how Daniel Sturridge is tomorrow [Saturday]. He's training, looking well.

'When Sturridge is playing, he's one of the top European strikers. It's important for him to play games to prove that consistently.

Rodgers also confirmed that Emre Can and Joe Allen are again available and they played a full part in training on Friday. He added that Dejan Lovren should also be fit.
