Top of the bill: Emma Watson is believed to top a list of guests to be invited to a new 'Cool Britannia' party at 10 Downing Street

Prime Minister David Cameron is poised to emulate Tony Blair’s ‘Cool Britannia’ celebration  by inviting some of the biggest names from the worlds of acting and music to a Downing Street party.

Among those reportedly sent invitations for the star-studded ‘Best of Britain’s creative industries’ reception at No 10 later this month are Benedict Cumberbatch, Emma Watson, Chiwetel Ejiofor, the star of the Oscar-winning Twelve Years a Slave, plus Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig.

But a notable omission from the list is said to be Take That singer Gary Barlow, after revelations in May that he was part of a massive tax avoidance scheme.

Other celebrity names on the draft guestlist include pop star Eliza Doolittle and Emily Eavis, the daughter of Glastonbury Festival founder Michael, X Factor supremo Simon Cowell, classical singers Bryn Terfel and Katherine Jenkins, plus Hollywood names Sam Mendes, Harvey Goldsmith, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker.

Nicole Kidman, though Australian-born, is said to be among those invited.

Mr Cameron has also sent an invitation to Pete Czernin, a lesser-known film producer – who was once a flatmate of the Prime Minister.

The event on June 30 is officially non-political but Whitehall sources told the Times the party was in part an attempt to recruit new supporters to the Conservatives’ cause ahead of the 2015 General Election.

Gabby Bertin, who became director of external relations at No 10 last year, is overseeing the bash.

Last night, the event was described by the Times, which revealed the existence of the draft guestlist, as ‘the most glittering collection of celebrities since Tony Blair tried to cash in on the Britpop craze  with his 1997 celebration of “Cool Britannia”.’

It is a comparison the PM may well not want to encourage.

Mr Blair’s
 party, which included such luminaries as Oasis guitarist Noel 
Gallagher, became a millstone around his neck as various stars 
criticised the New Labour government. It became seen in some quarters as
 exemplifying New Labour’s obsession with celebrity.

Blur singer Damon Albarn, who refused an invitation at the time, later said: ‘I knew by then we had all been taken for a ride.’

And Gallagher later notoriously claimed to have taken cocaine in a lavatory normally reserved for the Queen.

Recalling the incident when interviewed for BBC Radio 2 by Russell Brand, he claimed: ‘These were the days of the revolution. Someone said, “Do you want to have a look in the Queen’s bog?” I said, “Of course”. As I remember, it was quite nice. It had a velvet seat and everything.’

Other 
guests at Blair’s 1997 party were Hollywood star Kevin Spacey, actress 
Sinead Cusack, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, comedian Harry 
Enfield, Body Shop founder Anita Roddick and Beatles biographer Hunter 
Davies.

As
 for Mr Cameron’s bash, actor and Conservative Party supporter Sir 
Michael Caine, TV presenters Clare Balding, Fearne Cotton and Cat Deeley
 are also invited – as are Dame Helen Mirren and Ralph Fiennes, who both
 attended the Blair-era party too.

Downing Street last night told the Times: ‘We have nothing to say at this stage.’
