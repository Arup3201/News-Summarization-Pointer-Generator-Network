A Canadian teenager who ran a 'sophisticated' prostitution ring when she was just 15 has been jailed for six-and-a-half years.

Kailey Oliver-Machado, now 18, would lure girls as young as 13 from the Walkley housing complex in Ottawa on Facebook and Twitter saying they would be paid to attend parties and sleepovers.

But the victims would actually be plied with drugs and made to pose for semi-naked photos that would be sent to johns.

They would then be confined in small rooms, forced to perform sex acts and were threatened with violence if they didn't. 

Sentenced: Kailey Oliver-Machado, now 18, from Ottawa, who ran a 'sophisticated' prostitution ring involving girls as young as 13 when she was just 15 has been jailed for six-and-a-half years.

Shocking: The Canadian teenager would lure girls as young as 13 from Ottawa on Facebook and Twitter saying they would be paid to attend parties. But they would be plied with drugs and forced to perform sex acts

Some would even arrive at the houses with their teddy bears and pajamas, thinking they were just sleeping over with a friend. 

When they were there they would be taken in a taxi to the john's home where they would pay around $400 to have sex with them.  

Oliver-Machado was found guilty of 27 charges at trial including human trafficking, sexual assault and making and possessing child pornography. 

She was one of three girls who were responsible for the ring. The others can't be named because of their ages.  

While in pre-trial custody she was completing high school credits and said she was interested in gardening.

However Justice Diane Lahaie slapped her down, saying she was 'highly intelligent' and was only saying that to get a lesser sentence. 

She added that the system Oliver-Macahdo ran was 'sophisticated and well-organized human trafficking enterprise that included wardrobes and client lists'.

Luring: Oliver-Machado would message potential victims on Facebook with a 'party invite' 

Location: She ran what a judge referred to as a 'well-organized' system in this South End neighborhood in the Canadian capital 

Lahaie said she chose to sentence her as an adult because a youth sentence would not properly reflect the seriousness of her crimes.

The trial, which began in April 2013, heard from three teenage girls who were forced to perform sex acts and hand over the money they earned. 

Four other teens testified about a range of experiences, including being recruited online to sell their bodies.

Authorities said there could have been as many as nine victims.

Speaking to CBC, Sergeant Kelly Kyle from Ottawa Police said: 'We saw the pain that it caused and that was recognized today.'

The court heard last month that the youngest victim said she suffered nightmares as a result and was diagnosed with PTSD, and ultimately had to leave Ottawa.

Oliver-Machado was given credit for the time she has already served in pre-trial custody. It means she will be released in around three years. 

She was tried as an adult and received the maximum sentence.
