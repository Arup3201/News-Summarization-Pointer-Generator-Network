Brazil captain Thiago Silva claims Brazil will not need motivating ahead of their third-place play-off match with Holland as they must to restore their 'honour and dignity'.

The hosts were humiliated 7-1 by Germany in the World Cup semi-final, ending their dreams of winning a sixth World Cup and their first on home soil.

Louis van Gaal's Holland, meanwhile, were agonisingly beaten 4-2 on penalties by Brazil's bitter rivals Argentina following a goalless draw.

Motivation: Brazil captain Thiago Silva says the side will fight for their 'honour and dignity' against Holland

Preparation: Brazil players get ready for their third-place play-off with Holland on Saturday

Third place would not make up for Tuesday's crushing defeat, but Silva wants some pride restored to a nation who took the loss badly - and to gain revenge on Holland, who knocked Brazil out in the quarter-finals in 2010.

'We have the highest possible level of motivation,' said Silva, who sat out the semi-final through suspension.

'Obviously we have a different goal now and it's not first place we are fighting for but our honour and dignity," added the central defender.

'When you wear that shirt with the five stars on the front you have to respect it.

'I have spent many sleepless nights thinking about this World Cup and about the final at the Maracana (on Sunday) but it was not to be.'

Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari will make 'a few changes' from the semi-final loss, but Silva expected to return to the starting line-up alongside some players who have barely featured in the tournament so far.

Scolari, who has been backed to remain in his position by the president-elect of the Brazilian Football Confederation, said: 'We have to send an optimistic message to our supporters.

'We are still among the four best teams and it's not the end of the world.

'We have tried to lift the players and look on the Netherlands game as our main dream now.

'At least we have a chance to give the Brazilian people a bit of joy.'
