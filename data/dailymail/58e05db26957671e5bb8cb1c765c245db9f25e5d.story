A candlelight vigil has been held by the residents of a Boulder, Colorado for a bull elk which was reportedly shot and killed by an on-duty police officer.

Residents of the mountain city gathered on Sunday night to remember the animal which was fatally shot the Tuesday before.

An outraged crowd gathered in the Mapleton Hill area to say goodbye to the elk, lovingly called 'Big Boy.' The massive creature was described as their 'guardian' by some.

Probe: Boulder police officer Brent Curnow allegedly shot the elk and didn't report the killing while on-duty; he is now under investigation by the Colorado Parks & Wildlife department

The shooter was confirmed by the Boulder police chief to be officer Brent Curnow, who has worked for the department for 14 years, according to the Boulder Daily Camera.

The officer, who is facing a criminal investigation by Colorado Parks and Wildlife, failed to report the kill. The Daily Camera revealed that Curnow also owns a taxidermy website.

The Estes Gazette reports that Curnow initially reported that he killed the creature because it was injured, not aggressive.

His taxidermy website advertises ‘quality taxidermy at an affordable price,’ according to the paper.

Cornow, as well as the second officer with him, have been placed on leave while the investigation continues.

The incident is being investigated by Boulder police department. It is believed that the two officers were going to cut up the animal for meat.

There were mixed reports from Boulder residents that the bull elk had been behaving aggressively.
