More pressure has been heaped on the UK Border Agency after a damning report found that is continuing to fail.

The body charged with protecting the country's borders is already under investigation after damaging revelations last week that vital border checks for criminals and terrorists were secretly abandoned over the summer.

Three senior officials - including Brodie Clark, the head of the UK border force - have been suspended.

Suspended: Brodie Clarke is now facing the sack after claims that he relaxed passport checks

Theresa May will today give an emergency statement on the fiasco to MPs, which has led to the establishment of three inquiries.

The new report has revealed that officials have lost track of a population of asylum seekers and migrants the size of Cambridge.

The latest review of the UKBA by MPs also found that hundreds of foreign nationals who should have been deported are still in the country, and the agency is using euphemistic language designed to deflect attention away from key areas.

Furious: Home Secretary Theresa May

Figures revealed the number of 'lost' asylum and immigration cases had tripled in six months from 40,500 in March to 124,000 in September.

The so-called controlled archive became a 'dumping ground for cases where the UK Border Agency has lost track of the applicant', the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said.

The 'controlled archive', the MPs said, was 'a bureaucratic term which hides the true nature of a Government department's activity and is designed to deflect attention away from it'.

It would more appropriately be called 'an archive of lost applicants', they said.

The archive includes cases in which around 98,000 asylum seekers cannot be found and the agency has no idea whether the applicant even remains in the UK, legally or otherwise.

It also includes around 26,000 migrants 
following a review of cases, most of which are more than eight years 
old, and involve those who have overstayed their visas or who have been 
refused an extension of leave, such as students.

The agency was also criticised for 
failing to explain why 350 foreign national prisoners who should have 
been deported were still in the country.

Of
about 1,300 prisoners who were released between April 1 last year and 
March 31 this year, more than a quarter (27%) were labelled 'unknown'.

The
agency was even unable to disclose how many individuals were removed 
from the country based on intelligence provided by members of the 
public.

Unless the public can see that officials
use the intelligence provided, 'It will simply lead to further public 
frustration with the immigration system as a whole', the MPs said.

More problems: Further pressure has been heaped on the UK Border Agency following a damning report by MPs

Meanwhile, whistleblowers have blamed the latest border checks scandal on an official obsession with cutting queuing times at the nation’s air and sea ports.

Staff spoke out following the 
revelations that a senior UK Border Agency official had secretly 
abandoned checks on passports and even anti-terror watch lists for 
non-EU citizens.

Investigators are examining allegations 
that Brodie Clark, the £135,000-a-year head of the UK Border Force, 
approached the Home Secretary’s office for permission to weaken passport
checks during the busy summer months. Senior figures say he was 
explicitly told ‘No’ in writing – but then went ‘rogue’ and implemented 
the proposal anyway.

Ministers had agreed to one relaxation of the rules – but he then went much further, it is understood.

Investigations will also focus on 
whether port operators, including BAA which runs most of the UK’s major 
airports, were complicit in the decision because they wanted to avoid 
queues.

UKBA staff claim they were put under enormous pressure to avoid lengthy queues and delays which would infuriate passengers.

Last night, Andy Friend, national chairman of the Border Agency union ISU, said: ‘Government  imposed job cuts have exacerbated the internal problems within the agency  along with a misplaced focus on reducing queue times at air and sea ports. Our members have been and continue to be, opposed to watered down measures which undermine their ability to secure our nation’s borders to the highest degree possible.’

The Mail revealed on Saturday how  immigration officers were told secretly not to bother checking biometric chips on the passports of hundreds of thousands of citizens from outside the EU.

Staff were also instructed not to check their fingerprints or other details against a ‘warnings index’ containing the names of terror suspects and illegal immigrants.

Mrs May is furious and officials have been instructed that, if criminal wrongdoing can be established, prosecutions should be brought. During her appearance before MPs, Mrs May will come under pressure to say whether anybody posing a threat to national security slipped into the UK during the time the checks were relaxed.

Labour will also claim that ministers themselves began the process under which the rules were relaxed. Officials have confirmed that Mrs May and immigration minister Damian Green took a documented decision in July to allow border checks to be downgraded by a level, so that the biometric chips on EU passports would not be checked.

When approached by the Mail, Mr Clark, who was suspended last Thursday and faces the sack, said he could not comment on any of the allegations because of the ongoing investigations.

The UKBA was at the 
centre of another controversy this summer when it emerged officials 
missed six chances to stop a banned Palestinian activist from entering 
the UK.

Mrs May said an
investigation into how Sheikh Raed Salah was able to enter the UK in 
June despite being banned found 'insufficiently robust processes' led to
six missed chances to intervene overseas, on departure to, and in the 
UK.

A new system needed to 
be brought in to highlight live alerts to UK ports and to the agency's 
overseas network, while the police national computer should be amended 
to include details of those banned from the country, the Home Secretary 
said
