In Los Angeles, the city of Rolling Hills could be its most exclusive.

Consisting of a single gated community, there is a one-story height limit on houses, so instead of building up, you build down - deep into the bedrock.

The story of Hacienda de la Paz and its owner John Z. Blazevich, who's the CEO of shrimp importer Viva Food Group, decided to build his mansion five stories underground - it's accessible by stairs and two elevators.

Spreading over 50,000 square feet and on 7.27 acres, it was built over 17 years and overseen by Rafael Manzano Martos, a curator for King Juan Carlos of Spain.

There are nine bedrooms, 25 bathrooms, secret passageways, a Moroccan-style Turkish bath and even an underground tennis court which could be yours for a cool $53 million.

Prepare to enter: As featured on the cover of the L.A. Times - One of California's most unique & stunning homes

Look at the view: unimaginable panoramic views encompassing the beaches, West Side, the Hollywood Hills, downtown Los Angeles & the San Gabriel Mountains

Another world: Tranquil & exceptionally aromatic manicured grounds that include jetliner views

Museum-like: Extraordinary handcraft & artisan finishing throughout

Sleep well: Just one of the nine bedrooms and 25 bathrooms on the property

Billiards anyone? Hacienda De La Paz on the Palos Verdes peninsula in Los Angeles county took nearly 17 years to build

Down the rabbit hole: Ah, this must be the a Moroccan-style Turkish bath

Midnight swim:  At nearly 50,000 square feet, it sits mostly underground to meet zoning requirements

Stunning: Built over 17 years, the house was overseen by Rafael Manzano Martos, a curator for King Juan Carlos of Spain

Indoor play: A five-story indoor tennis court designed to US Open specifications (Pete Sampras has visited)

Imported: The interlocking wood ceilings were built in Spain and hand-fitted together

What lies beneath: The house is nearly 50,000 square feet and sits on 7.27 acres
