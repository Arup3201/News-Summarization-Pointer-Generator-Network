A jaw-dropping video shows the moment a climber plunges 60ft after the wall of ice he is scaling shatters and falls away from the cliff face - miraculously leaving him completely unhurt.

John Freeman solo climbed the vertical ice wall at Icefield Parkway #93N in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada.

Using only ice axes and crampons, Mr Freeman was carefully making his ascent until a misplaced strike shattered the ice, causing the entire frozen face to cascade to the ground.

Ascent: John Freeman was climbing an column of ice at a frozen waterfall in Canada when it snapped off and he fell

John had to be incredibly delicate with his ice axe and crampons because of the fragility of the ice

Incredibly, the climbing guide from Canmore, Alberta, was only winded when he rode the tonnes of falling ice to the ground.

He said: 'It was a warm day, we got a good sense, like it was a healthy piece of ice there - and we wanted to climb.

'I walked up to the ice and it was super thin, it wasn't even as wide as my soldiers, I had to climb very delicately, it was intense.

'I could feel the climb move under me, I had never encountered that before.'

Vertigo: The climber stops and takes a look down, giving the viewer a dizzying sense of the danger he faces

Sheer fear: John Freeman's view of the exact moment the ice pillar cracks as the ice axe thuds into the surface

He said the actual fall happened so sharply he didn't even realise what was happening. 'It was fast - the tool struck the ice and I immediately felt that I was moving,' he said.

'I could hear the ice breaking and I realised the whole thing was collapsing and there was nothing I could do about it.

'The sharp pieces of ice were digging into my body as I was sliding along the ground and I just waited for it to stop - and I was alive.'

Amazingly, Mr Freeman went climbing the very next day. He says the adrenaline is what drives climbers to constantly put themselves in precarious situations.

He added: 'We scare the heck out of ourselves and laugh about it afterwards. It's what keeps us coming back for more.

'I got away with something really lucky.'

His friend Will Gadd said: 'If you are an ice climber (the footage) is going to leave you pretty much speechless.

'It's tonnes and tonnes of ice.'

Undaunted, Mr Freeman was up and climbing again the very next day: 'It's what keeps us coming back for more'
