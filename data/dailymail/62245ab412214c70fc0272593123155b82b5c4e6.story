A  woman claims to have been sacked after turning off a colleague's power washer to observe a two-minute silence on Armistice Day.

Norma Gregory was working at an Arnold Clark car showroom in Aberdeen on November 11 at 11am.

The 57-year-old stopped what she was doing to respect the customary two-minute silence, turning off her colleague's power washer so that she may do the same.  

When the woman turned the machine back on, Ms Gregory tried to block her by pushing her arm.

Norma Gregory was sacked after becoming involved in an altercation with a colleague who used a power washer as the 57-year-old was trying to observe a two-minute silence on Armistice Day

A complaint was made and Ms Gregory was sent home before being called back in to the car showroom days later to be sacked.

'It was unbelievable that I ended up sacked for just trying to observe the two-minute silence,' the mother-of-two said.  

'It was a storm in a teacup. I touched her arm slightly, nothing more.' 

Ms Gregory had been working at the showroom for two months on Remembrance Day. 

The former Scottish Water employee said she asked staff what the company had planned to commemorate the centenary of the First World War, but was shocked when she learned nothing had been arranged.  

'I spoke with the assistant manager at the start of the day to ask what we were doing but he said there was nothing planned.

'I thought it was poor considering what an important day it was and particularly with Sir Arnold’s background in the forces.' 

Sir Arnold Clark left the RAF in 1954 after ten years of service. Two years after being discharged, the car tycoon opened his first showroom. 

Ms Gregory was shocked when she was called into her boss's office at the showroom in Aberdeen and sacked days after the altercation 

Sir Arnold Clark, who has more than 200 showrooms in the UK, served in the RAF for ten years 

Speaking of the altercation, she said: 'At 11 o’clock I was in the car valeting bay with a colleague and we were cleaning a car.

'The radio was playing and the presenter said they were going to the news and a two-minute silence would follow.

'But my colleague kept working despite me asking her to stop.

'I turned off the power washer she was using and then she turned it on again. Then I turned it back off again.

'This continued for a few seconds before I stood in front of it to stop her turning it back on again.

'When she tried to reach around me I pushed her arm away.

'She said I couldn’t do that and then the next thing I know I was ordered into the boss’s office.'

A spokesman for Arnold Clark said declined to comment on Ms Gregory's departure from the company, but said: 'We were aware of Norma’s feelings about Remembrance Day.'
