President Obama is set to make gun control - as well as taxes and spending - a key part of his State of the Union speech after the first lady invited the parents of the slain Chicago teenager who has become the poster child for gun violence in the president's home city.

The president is also expected to press Congress for additional tax hikes, fewer 
spending cuts, outreach for military families and immigration 
reform, which is shaping up to be a key part of his second term agenda.

The
agenda Obama will outline will include more money for infrastructure, 
clean energy technologies and manufacturing jobs, as well as expanding 
access to early childhood education.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said
Obama would outline 'his plan to create jobs and grow the middle class'
as the nation struggles with persistently high unemployment.

Recent tragedy: 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton was shot dead just a mile from Mr Obama's Chicago home and only a week after she performed at his second inauguration

Some
of Obama's job ideas will be repackaged versions of proposals he made 
during his first term, though aides say there will be some new 
initiatives, too. 

All of 
the economic proposals are expected to echo themes from Obama's 
re-election campaign, which focused on using increased spending to 
generate jobs, protecting programs to help the middle class, and 
bringing down the deficit in part by culling more tax revenue from the 
wealthiest Americans.

Obama has called for raising more revenue through closing tax breaks and loopholes, but he has not detailed a list of targets.

He
and his aides often mention as examples of unnecessary tax breaks a 
benefit for owners of private jets and tax subsidies for oil and gas 
companies.

But no portion of Obama's remarks may
be more poignant than the renewed call for tougher firearms laws with 
Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton and Nathaniel Pendleton looking on.

Their
15-year-old daughter Hadiya was shot dead just a mile from Mr Obama’s 
Chicago home and only a week after she performed at his second 
inauguration.

Chicago police announced Monday evening that they had arrested two men in the case.

Mr and Mrs Pendleton have been invited
to make the painful return trip to Washington D.C. by First Lady 
Michelle Obama, who offered them a seat in her box.

There they will be joined by others who suffered tragedy and loss as a result of gun violence.

Mr Obama has already pledged to ban the sale of assault weapons, introduce tougher background checks and reduce the capacity of magazines.

He was moved by the shooting of 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December.

Mrs Obama attended the Hadiya’s funeral along with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, who are both from Chicago.

A handwritten note to Hadiya's family from the Obamas was even published on her funeral program.

It read: ‘Dear Cleopatra and 
Nathaniel, Michelle and I just wanted you to know how heartbroken we are
to have heard about Hadiya's passing.

'We
know that no words from us can soothe the pain, but rest assured that 
we are praying for you, and that we will continue to work as hard as we 
can to end this senseless violence. God Bless, Barack Obama.'

Hadiya was shot dead January 29 while sheltering from the rain in a Chicago park, the innocent victim of a gang shootout.

Her death made her the 42nd person to be gunned down in the city this year alone.

In
a bitter irony, she was not only an honors student but an advocate for 
her fellow pupils who said in a video posted online: 'It is your job as 
students to say no to gangs and yes to a great future.'

Chicago police said Monday evening 
that two reputed gang members, Michael Ward,18, and Kenneth Williams, 
20, have been charged with her murder.

They
were arrested after police used video surveillance and tips from 
community residents during their investigations, sources told DNAinfo.com/Chicago.

'I’m ecstatic. The whole family is ecstatic,' Hadiya’s mother, Cleopatra, told The Chicago Sun-Times.

'I just pray they are penalized to the full extent of the law.'

Meanwhile, Republicans have shown little sign of falling in line behind the president ahead of his speech tonight, particularly when it comes to taxes.

'Clearly
the president wants more revenue for more government,' Senate Minority 
Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in an interview.

'He's gotten all the revenue he's going to get. Been there, done that.'

The
backdrop for Obama's address will be a March 1 deadline for averting 
automatic across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester. 

The president wants lawmakers to push
that deadline back for a second time to create space for a larger 
deficit-reduction deal, one he hopes would include a balance of targeted
cuts and increased tax revenue.

Republicans want to offset the sequester with spending cuts alone.

As he addresses lawmakers and the American people, Obama is expected to say that government entitlement programs should be on the table in deficit reduction talks.

But he will also make the case that programs that help the middle class, the poor and the elderly must be protected.

In keeping with that approach, the White House said Monday that Obama would not consider increasing the Medicare eligibility age as a way to reduce spending.

The president's focus on the economy and deficit reflects the top concerns of many Americans.

A Quinnipiac University poll out Monday showed than 35 per cent of registered voters are most interested in hearing the president during the State of the Union address the economy, more than any other issue.

The federal deficit came in second, with 20 per cent saying that was the issue they were most interested in hearing Obama discuss.

The poll also suggested that the slow but steady economic gains throughout Obama's first term may not be trickling down to many Americans.

More than 50 per cent of registered voters said they thought the economy was still in a recession and 79 per cent described the economy as 'not so good' or 'poor.'
