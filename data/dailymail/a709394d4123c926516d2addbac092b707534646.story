An 18-year-old elementary school lunchroom aide who allegedly paid two fourth graders $1 to beat up one of their classmates has been charged with two misdemeanors and fired from her job.

Brooke Wilson-Johnson, of Michigan, handed the money to two nine-year-old boys, who allegedly roughed up the victim, also nine, 'for swearing at Wilson-Johnson'.

Wilson-Johnson has been charged with disorderly conduct and aiding and abetting delinquency, after an investigation into the October 7 incident.

The lunchroom aide was spotted by other staff at Campus Elementary School in Grand Rapids, Michigan, handing a $1 note to a child during the lunch recess.

She allegedly wanted to pay students to beat up the victim in retaliation for calling her a 'pregnant b****'.

The victim told school officials that he was pushed, bumped, thrown out of seat, and had his food taken.

An investigation into the incident showed that he pleaded for help, speaking to teacher Renee Lance.

In her report Lane wrote that the victim said: 'Mrs. Lance, you gotta help me! That lunch lady is giving kids a dollar to beat me up.'

When Wilson-Johnson was quizzed about the incident by the school principal she denied paying students to carry out the attack.

School principal Bernard Colton said when he asked her what happened, she said she was 'playing'.

She allegedly admitted the threat to the principal and told him the boy had sworn at her - a claim backed up by other employees, records show.

But when police launched their investigation the lunchtime aide denied playing any part in the 'contract' beating.

'The suspect said she never offered any money to the kids to beat up the victim,' according to Detective Mason Klein, in a report based on a phone conversation with Wilson-Johnson.

'She said the principal's statement is a lie. She said she is not a bad person.'

Records show that Wilson-Johnson was observed giving one student $1 by a resource teacher, Renee Lance, in the cafeteria.

According to the report, Wilson-Johnson said she was going to buy a boy a bag of chips for standing up to the nine-year-old who swore at her, but ended up giving him a dollar instead.

She said the boy to whom she gave the dollar never beat up his classmate.

According to police three students, instead of two, were involved - two nine-year-old boys and a girl, age 10.

The students said Wilson-Johnson gave each of them dollar, according to the police report.

Wilson-Johnson, a contracted employee, was fired after the investigation by school chiefs.

School district officials said she had passed the required background checks and began work at the start of the August term.
