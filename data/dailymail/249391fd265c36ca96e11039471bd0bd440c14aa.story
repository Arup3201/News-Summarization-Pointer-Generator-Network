Forty years ago this week, the nation was captivated by one of the most horrendous crimes in living memory.

An unprovoked frenzied axe attack by a total stranger on a ten-year-old as she walked home from school.

And as police launched one of the biggest manhunt in South Wales Police history and detectives chased down leads on the appalling crime, only one thing seemed certain: that little Paula Hughes would never leave a normal, happy life - if she survived at all.

But Paula has made a remarkable recovery, defying the negligible odds she was given by medics in the wake of the shocking attack.

Not only did she go on to regain movement and speech following pioneering treatment in the U.S, but she also went on to have two children - and has now welcomed her first grandson into her life.

Recovery: Paula Hughes (pictured right with her mother Gennifer Hughes) was left for dead after being attacked by an axe-wielding thug as she walked home from school in Caerphilly in 1975

Left for dead: The young girl (pictured left before the attack and right afterwards) was hit over the head 15 times during the brutal incident 

Paula, now 50, said: 'I didn't think I would ever be normal but if it was not for the programme I don't know what I would have been like.' 

She added: 'I was just going home from school and I went to the shortcut - that was the railway track - and for no reason somebody hit me over the head with an axe.

'Now I have got Robert, who is 15 now and Emily, 18, and she is a mother as well. I'm now a nan to Baby David. He's rather funny.'  

Smiling as she sits next to her mother, the sight is a far cry from what the family expected when surgeons told her mother Gennifer to 'forget her daughter' and leave her to die in hospital. 

Medics had told Gennifer that her ten-year-old had barely any chance of survival and would be unable to walk or talk if she did make it through.

Her mother said: 'I just can't believe how it has all turned out, I never imagined that I would be a grandmother, never mind a great-grandmother.

'At this point in my life, I am so very happy. We have had our problems along the way, but I am so very glad I didn't listen to the surgeon who told me to just leave her.' 

The attack, which sent shockwaves through the community, took place on February 13, 1975.

Desperate to get home after the school bell rang at Cwm Ifor Junior School for the day, Paula had thrown on her backpack and began walking back to her home in Caerphilly, as she did every day.

But, as she took a shortcut along the railway embankment, she was struck over the head by the mystery attacker, who split open her skull in one of 15 excruciating blows.

Manhunt: The attack, which sent shockwaves through the community, sparked one of the biggest manhunts ever carried out by South Wales Police but the attacker disappeared

So desperate were Paula's attempt to shield herself from the man's menacing attack that her left hand was almost severed as she tried to protect her head.

In hospital, surgeons removed a piece of brain tissue the size of an egg. But, despite the work carried out by medics, they warned Paula's devastated family that, if she even survived to the end of the week, she would never walk or talk again. 

For her mother Gennifer, who lives with Paula and her family in Gwent, the memory of what happened is as clear as if it were yesterday.  

'The cat was ill, so I was planning on taking her to the vet after work,' said Gennifer,  69.

'I had told Paula that, if she was not home in time, I would go on to the vet so as I didn't miss them before closing.

'She wasn't there, so I left her a note saying that she should stay at home until I got back. I remember clearly that the weather was dreadful and I thought twice about going, but the cat really needed to see the vet.'

When Gennifer got back, she found her neighbour at home, who was 'white as a sheet'. 

Re-enactment: Police re-enacted the attack on Paula alongside the Rhymney Valley railway line, Caerphilly

Return: Despite her ordeal, Paula returned to the same spot where she had been attacked 12 months later to help police re-enact the scene, in the hope of finding the mystery man 

Probe: Detective Constable Wendy Parry retraces the steps taken by Paula on the day of the fateful attack. Paula's friend Jacqueline Williams (pictured front) also walked with the officer

'I remember thinking it was strange because the neighbour had red hair and a red face, but he was white as a sheet,' she said.

'He followed me into the house and I saw immediately that Paula's coat and shoes were not where she usually left them and the note hadn't been touched. I knew immediately something bad had happened and they took me straight to the hospital, but I still didn't know how bad it was.'

When Gennifer got to the hospital, Paula's father broke the devastating news.  

'He told me she had been hit 15 times with an axe - 15 times,' says Gennifer.

'I don't know how I managed to stay upright. That was the biggest shock of all and then I wasn't able to see her because she was in surgery. 

'When we finally got to see her, she was all bandaged up and her eyes were almost closed. There was blood on her legs because they had been so focused on the surgery they had not had time to clean her up. None of it felt very real, it was like waking up in a nightmare.'

Fear: Parents who would usually let their children walk home alone from Cwm Ifor Junior School arrive at the school to the collect them following the attack

'They told me that if she survived the next three days, she would never walk or talk again. 

'One doctor told me to go away, leave Paula with them and to forget about her. He said I was young enough to have another family, but there was no way I was going to leave my daughter there.' 

Despite advances in forensic science, the brazen attacker has never been caught. Cruelly, heavy rain washed the evidence away and they have never been found.

But the mystery over the attacker's identity became secondary to the remarkable recovery story which was to follow.

Family: Paula's children Emily, now 18, and Robert, now 15, (left) and her grandson David, 16 months 

Surgeons at Cardiff Royal Infirmary tried to explain to Paula's parents how badly injured she was. 

'At the end of the day, they were not giving us much hope, and said that she was likely to be a vegetable because her brain injury was so severe,' recalls Gennifer. 

Gennifer refused to believe the doctors and took her daughter to America for pioneering assessment at the Institute for the Achievement of Human Potential.

With financial help from friends, Paula endured six years of physical and mental exercises, which lasted 14 hours a day. 

When they started the treatment, Paula was in a wheelchair, unable to feed herself. By the end, she was able to hold down a job in an electronics factory.

Paula's health continued to go from strength to strength. She soon met John and together they had children Emily, now 18, and Robert, 15.

Then, 16 months ago, Emily gave birth to David - her first grandchild. 

David's birth, which made Gennifer a great-grandmother, was yet another chapter in Paula's story which the family never thought they would see. 

Gennifer said: 'They get embarrassed when I say it, but I am so, so proud of them all.

'When Paula was pregnant first time, I didn't tell anyone, but I really hoped that she would have a girl because I could get to see a little girl grow up the way they should.'
