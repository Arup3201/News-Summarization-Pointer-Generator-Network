Chung Kim, 76, was convicted for murder on Thursday after he killed his upstairs neighbors over a dog feces dispute

A 76-year-old Dallas, Texas man was convicted of capital murder on Thursday in the shooting deaths of his neighbors last year because of a months-long feud about their dog's feces on his porch.

A jury found that Chung Kim fatally shot his neighbor Michelle Jackson, 31, on February 4, as she stood on her balcony above his apartment. Kim then went upstairs to her residence and shot and killed her boyfriend, Jamie Stafford, 31.

The couple's dog would relieve itself on their balcony, causing the urine and feces to drip down Kim's balcony each time they washed it, according to court records.

Kim claimed the couple had 'intentionally thrown dog feces' on his porch.

'That’s all come down from my patio, from up patio. But now, three months later so stink,' he told CBS from jail.

He also said that the shooting of Stafford was in self-defense but that he could not remember shooting Jackson because he suffered a blackout.

Kim faces an automatic life sentence in prison without parole.

Just months before their death, Jackson and Stafford had their first child together. Jackson also had four children aged 7 to 11 from a previous partner.

The baby now lives with Jackson's parents and the four children live with their father in Garland, Texas.

The Dallas News reports that Kim, with the help of an interpreter, begged district Judge Balido for a new trial and entirely new lawyers.

Judge Balido told Kim that she would appoint Kim a court-appointed attorney for appeals if convicted.

He said he wanted to share his side of the story and claims that he was terrorized by his neighbors.

Kim's defense attorney spoke on his behalf. 'They specifically came down and dumped it on his shoes and on the door,' defense attorney Kobby Warren said.

CBS interviewed Kim who shared his account of the event. He says it was his neighbor who pulled a gun on him and that he shot in self-defense.

He claims he used martial arts to wrestle the gun out of Stafford's hands.

'Before he pull trigger, I got him!' Kim told CBS from his jail cell.

'I hit him in his gun. And pushed his arm. And, I take his gun. And with my elbow knock him down,' he continued.

He says the woman was not killed out of self-defense and claims he doesn't remember shooting her.

'I saw him. I don’t remember. At this time, My brain is gone. After this, I don’t know,' he said.

'I call, "Hey stop. Stop. And he go up. He say wait." And, he come back. Threw gun onto my head,' Kim said.

The police affidavit describes a different account of the event. It says, around 8 o’clock Monday morning, Chung Kim shot Michelle Jackson while she was standing on her balcony.

Defense attorney Koby Warren asked the jury to consider a lesser murder charge.

The prosecution argued that revenge is not an acceptable impetus for murder.

'This isn’t an eviction proceeding. If that was the case, the defense would win,' prosecutor Herschel Woods said. 'There could have been time for cool reflection.'

'Because you were angry doesn’t mean you can exact a terrible punishment on someone,' he concluded.

Jackson's mother, Yvonne Hypolite, read a statement after the judge read the verdict.

'The smallest baby will never know her mother,' Hypolite said. 'I don’t understand, Kim, why you killed my daughter.' 

'I’m really glad he got sentenced, but it still can’t bring my daughter back,' said Hypolite.
