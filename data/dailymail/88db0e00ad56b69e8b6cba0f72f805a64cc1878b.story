Reeva Steenkamp's mother says she does not care if an upcoming appeal leads to a harsher sentence for Oscar Pistorius, the South African athlete who killed her.

He was convicted of 'negligent killing' in September 2014 which carries a maximum five-year prison sentence - but prosecutors believe he should be charged with the more serious crime of murder.

The Olympian's lawyers will this week challenge the judge's decision to allow prosecutors to appeal his conviction for killing Reeva at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day in 2013.

His deceased girlfriend's mother June is not seeking revenge against the disabled athlete but says she knew nothing 'about Oscar's guns and his way of life' and criticised her daughter's portrayal during the case.

Moving on: June Steenkamp (pictured at Pistorius' trial) does not want revenge on her daughter's killer but says she knew nothing about his 'guns and way of life'

She said: 'She was, in the trial, referred to as "the deceased". She became invisible. People forgot that someone died here. My daughter died. Horribly.'

'I don't want him to suffer in any way, because he's a disabled person.' 

Mrs Steenkamp has now written a book about her daughter called 'Reeva: A Mother's Story' and the upcoming launch of the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation to battle domestic violence. 

Although she finds it 'very strange that they were fighting in a three month relationship', she refused to say if Reeva was herself a victim of domestic violence.

And regarding the appeal to have Pistorius convicted of murder, she said: 'How is it going to help me?'

Oscar Pistorius was reported to be furious after learning that prosecutors had been granted permission to take the case to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal.

Oscar Pistorius flew into a rage after learning that prosecutors had been given permission to appeal his murder acquittal - opening the door for a stiffer 15-year prison sentence.

In 2014, prosecutors won their bid to challenge his manslaughter verdict handed to the Paralympic gold medalist - opening the door for a possible 15-year prison sentence.

Change: June hopes her new book 'Reeva: A Mother's Story' and a new foundation she's setting up in the deceased model's name will help combat domestic violence in South Africa

Angry: Pistorius - who won six Paralympic gold medals throughout his career - was reportedly furious when he found out prosecutors would be allowed to challenge his conviction for 'negligent killing'

A source said: 'He got up and stomped. He went straight to the gym. He started lifting weights like it was going out of fashion. He is p***** off.'

Legal experts said it was unlikely that Pistorius would now be released on house arrest after serving just ten months of his sentence as he had previously hoped.

His former girlfriend's mother has now urged women to speak out about their own abuse - telling the audience at the University of Johannesburg: 'Teach your daughters to have the confidence to come forward.

Her foundation will do the work her daughter would have done if she had still been alive, said Mrs Steenkamp.

She revealed that her daughter had been 'preoccupied' with the unacceptable numbers of rape and murders reported in her native South Africa.

It was reported earlier this month that Oscar Pistorius is so paranoid about being poisoned in prison that he is reportedly surviving on tinned food from the tuck shop.

The Paralympic star, who was jailed four months ago for killing his girlfriend has lost so much weight that his prosthetic limbs no longer fit him, according to South Africa's You Magazine.
