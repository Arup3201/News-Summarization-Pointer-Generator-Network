Occupy London protesters will be evicted from St Paul's after talks with City authorities broke down, it was announced today.

It comes just hours after riot police stormed Occupy Wall Street in New York forcing protesters out of the camp that has become a global movement's focal point.

The City of London Corporation has put the blame firmly on the protesters who it said failed to agree to leave in January 2012 or to shrink the camp.

Occupy out: The City of London confirmed it was relaunching legal proceedings against protesters today

Stuart Fraser, policy chairman at the corporation, said: 'We paused legal action for two weeks for talks with those in the camp on how to shrink the extent of the tents and to set a departure date - but got nowhere.

'So, sadly, now they have rejected a reasonable offer to let them stay until the new year, it's got to be the courts.

'We'd still like to sort this without court action but from now on we will have to have any talks in parallel with court action - not instead.'

A notice regarding the decision is expected to be served to the Occupy London movement tomorrow.

Mr Fraser said: 'We are getting reports about vulnerable people, cases of late-night drinking and other worrying trends, so it's time to act. It will clearly take time but we are determined to see this through.

'Lawful protesters who stand or walk are a regular part of London. But tents, equipment and now, increasingly, quite a lot of mess, is not what a highway is for and others are losing out.'

Ronan McNern, a spokesman for Occupy London, said: 'It's really sad this is the way the City of London Corporation thought they had to go.

'To be honest, it's really disappointing that they cut off the process of dialogue.

'However, if they want to go down this route we have a legal team who are fully prepared.

'It's significant that the City of London Corporation announced this today just as there have been violent evictions in New York and across the United States.'

The chapter of St Paul's Cathedral are meeting tomorrow to consider their response, a cathedral spokesman said.

Notices given to the protesters in New York said the park 'poses an increasing health and fire safety hazard to those camped in the park, the city's first responders and the surrounding community'.

Protesters were told they could return within hours, but without sleeping bags, tarps or tents.

Occupy London organisers have called for supporters to meet outside the US Embassy in London this afternoon.

Occupy London said in a statement: 'As part of the gathering, Americans allied with Occupy Wall Street and Occupy London will demand entry to the embassy to question the ambassador on events happening in New York.'

Unruly behaviour: The City said reports of unruly behaviour after dark also made it reconsider legal action

Mr Fraser said City of London Corporation had taken the decision to pursue legal action some time ago, but 'where we've had our finger on the pause button, we've now taken it off'.

Protesters will be told to remove their tents and equipment within 24 hours. If they remain, proceedings will be issued in the High Court.

It is thought London protesters were aiming to 
stay through the Olympic Games next summer –which would guarantee 
international attention for their cause and embarrassment for the 
Government.

Mr Fraser said talks with the protesters made it clear that they 'are not going to move any time soon'.

He said: 'We have a responsibility to clear the highway, which is frankly for the use of everybody. We don't have a choice in this.'

Mr Fraser said businesses near St Paul's Cathedral have complained and are concerned they will suffer trading losses in the run-up to Christmas.

The Corporation is expecting a legal challenge from the protesters. 'I am quite sure their legal teams are on standby,' said Mr Fraser.

Court action is likely to take weeks. In a statement, the City of London Corporation said no enforcement action will take place without a further committee debate.

The Corporation's bid does not extend to tents on land belonging to St Paul's Cathedral, which suspended its legal action against the protesters on November 1.

Two senior St Paul’s clergy have resigned during the crisis: the Dean, the Very Rev Graeme Knowles, and Canon Chancellor Giles Fraser

The demonstraters, who arrived outside the cathedral in October as a ragtag group retreating from a failure to occupy the nearby Stock Exchange,  elevated their protest camp into a direct challenge to the Government and its attempt to resist the long-running French and German campaign to attack the wealth of the City.
