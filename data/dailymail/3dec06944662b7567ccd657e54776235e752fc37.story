A morbidly obese man desperately attempts to avoid the same ill fate as his father and sister who both died of weight-related illnesses, on tonight's episode of TLC's My 600-lb Life.

James, 38, from Frankston, Texas, appears in a preview clip crying as he recounts the grim prognosis doctors have given him if he doesn't take instant action.

His mother, who he lives with, says that she feels her cooking is to blame for his staggering 750lb frame and hopes that he isn't 'too bitter' about the situation.

750lb man: James, 38, from Frankston, Texas, appears in a preview clip crying tears as he tells viewers the grim prognosis doctors have given him

'I cooked how I knew to cook . . . I guess blames me,' she sobs.

She also cites genetics as a contributing factor, adding 'a lot of it is our family history.'

Recalling the moment he knew his weight had spiraled out of control, James says: 'About four or five years 
ago I went to the doctor and they bought these big scales and [I] 
stepped on them.

'My first thought was: "It can't be, no way!"

Source of the problem? His mother, who he lives with, says that she feels her cooking is to blame for his staggering 750lb frame and hopes that he isn't 'too bitter'

His mother says he has remained around the 750lb mark ever since.

Ashamed of his body, James hides himself away during the day at 
his farm's accounting office, dealing with the stress of his clients and 
demanding deadlines behind closed doors.

He only leaves to occasionally to ride tractors and stack hay - often stopping in at a fast food drive-thru on his return home.

'Most people when they get off of work want to go 
grab a beer,' James says. 'I just want to eat.'

Family history: James pictured as a youngster with his father, who  weighed around 450lbs and died as a result

Only young: James' sister, pictured, passed away six months after his father

His mother reveals that he hit a 
major low point and 'almost lost it', following the loss of his father 
and then his sister six months later.

While James weighs three-quarters of a ton, his father was only around 450lbs when his body gave up.

Unable to move far, James now sleeps in a hospital bed on the ground-floor at home.

It was the same one his father and sister used before they passed away.

Concerned: James' mother fears he will meet the same ill fate as her husband and daughter

'When [James] took the bed over I thought what is this, is he the next in line?' his mother says.

However, James is desperate to reverse the trend.

On tonight's installment of My 600-lb Life he is seen as he goes about losing the weight needed for gastric bypass surgery.

His says he dream is to have a family one day and a life of his own, away from his mother.
