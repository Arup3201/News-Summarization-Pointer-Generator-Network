A convicted murderer with a 'White Power' tattoo on his forehead has been sentenced to his second life term for killing a fellow inmate to 'avenge' the death of a nine-year-old girl.

Frank Souza, 33, who was already set to spend the rest of his life behind bars pleaded guilty to stabbing Edward John Schaefer, 44, in the neck and chest with an improvised knife 10 days after he arrived in San Quentin State Prison in July 2010.

The attack was carried out by Souza to avenge Melody Osheroff, who was walking with her father across the road when Schaefer mowed into them on his motorcycle

Unrepentant: Frank Souza was proud that he had killed fellow inmate Edward John Schaefer for his role in the death of a nine year old girl

Schaefer's blood-alcohol level after the May 2009 incident measured 0.16, twice the legal limit in Novato, whic is near to the San Francisco Bay area

'All I got to say is, 9-year-old girl,' said Souza to prison staff after killing Schaefer.

A member of the racist Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, Souza was adamant that his killing of Schaefer was justified.

'The innocence of a child will be defended at all costs,' said Frank Souza.

After the verdict was handed down, Souza read aloud from the William Henley poem, 'Invictus', which Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh quoted from before his 2001 execution.

'I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul,' quoted Souza after his his life sentence without parole was announced.

Heavily tattooed Souza cut a deal with prosecutors to waive his right to an appeal when he pleaded guilty.

In exchange, authorities agreed not to seek the death penalty against Souza.

'He will remain in prison for the rest of his life,' said Chief Deputy District Attorney Barry Borden.

Already convicted nine times of driving while intoxicated, Edward John Schaefer not only killed Melody but also caused her father Aaron Osheroff to suffer the loss of his leg.

Before the court's decision, Souza's attorney, M Gerald Schwartzbach told the San Francisco Chronicle that his guilty plea 'did nothing to affect Frank's future.'

Souza was already in San Quentin Prison serving a sentence of 60 years to life for stangling and beating to death a John Carl Riggins, 59, in a back alley in San Jose in August 2007.

The men were homeless at the time and apparently had become involved in a fracas after Souza stole Riggins' mountain bike according to authorities.

No one from Schaefer's family or the Osheroffs attended the hearing.
