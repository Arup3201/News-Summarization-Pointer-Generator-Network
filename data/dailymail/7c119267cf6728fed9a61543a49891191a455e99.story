Gerry Adams has been accused from beyond the grave of ordering the murder and secret burial of a mother of ten children.

The Sinn Fein president was identified by former Belfast IRA commander Brendan Hughes in a conversation recorded seven years before his death in 2008.

In it the paramilitary boss, once a close friend of Mr Adams, pointed the finger at him over the killing of Jean McConville in 1972.

Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has been accused by Brendan Hughes of ordered the killing of Jean McConville in 1972 in a tape released after his death

He said: ‘There’s only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed. That man is now the head of Sinn Fein.’

The tape recording will be broadcast tonight as part of an investigation into victims of the Troubles whose bodies have never been found, known as the ‘disappeared’.

Many of them were killed after being accused of passing information to the British security services.

Mr Adams denies being either a senior leader of the Provisionals in Belfast or ordering the murder of Mrs McConville.

‘I had no part to play in either the abduction, the killing or burial of Jean McConville or indeed any of these other people. Brendan is telling lies,’ he said.

In the recording Hughes says: 'There's only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed. That man is now the head of Sinn Fein.'

Allegations linking Mr Adams to the notorious murder are made in clandestine tapes recorded by Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries.

They were handed to police this summer after more than a decade gathering dust in the archives of the Burns Library in Boston College in the U.S.

Mr Hughes, who died in 2008, made his claim seven years earlier on the condition that it would not be published until after his death.

He also said Mr Adams went to the McConville children after their mother was abducted and promised an internal IRA investigation.

He said: ‘That man is the man who gave the order for that woman to be executed. I did not give the order to execute that woman. He did.’

A second IRA member, Old Bailey bomber Dolours Price, who died earlier this year, also made a recording implicating Mr Adams in the murder.

She claimed that she helped to transport the 37-year-old victim to the Irish Republic where she was tortured, tied up and shot.

The remains of Mrs McConville were recovered more than three decades after she was abducted at Shelling Beach, Co Louth in August 2003.

Forensic tests revealed she had been badly beaten and shot in the back of the head. He discovery is now part of a live criminal inquiry.

One of her children, Michael McConville, 51, said he is still fighting for those responsible to be brought to justice.

‘If I lived for 200 years I still don’t think I could describe how I felt when we got my mother’s body back,’ he said.

‘They took my mother from her house. To bring her down to a beach with her hands tied behind her back and to put a gun to the back of her head and shoot her - that’s an execution.

‘They knew exactly who they were killing and what she was leaving behind. That was a war crime and the people responsible should be brought to The Hague.’

Mr McConville can still vividly remember the day his mother was dragged from their home with his siblings clinging to her arms and legs.

Micheal McConville, the son of murdered Jean, says he will never forget the day the IRA took his mother away and shot her

A gang of up to 20 IRA men and women were involved, including two neighbours who knew the children by name.

He then endured a three-hour ordeal at the hands of the IRA’s youth wing as a warning to stay silent.

‘I was going to give the names of the ones who were not wearing masks to the police,’ he said.

‘They said they were going to shoot me if I told anything about any member of the IRA. That they would shoot me or shoot a member of the family.’

At least 17 people were abducted, killed and secretly buried in unmarked graves in remote locations by republican paramilitaries.

In some cases they weighed down their bodies with heavy stones to ensure they would not be found if the bogs they were buried in dried up.

The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims’ Remains (ICLVR) has so far found eight of the ‘disappeared’.

The first of the ‘disappeared’ to be found was north Belfast man Eamon Molloy, whose remains were discovered in 1999.

Speaking yesterday, senior Sinn Fein member Martin McGuinness said families of the ‘disappeared’ have suffered a ‘despicable ordeal’.

He said: ‘What happened to those families was totally and absolutely wrong. I believe it was cruel, I believe it was unjustified. Of course the IRA were responsible.’

The Disappeared, a co-production between RTE and the BBC, will be broadcast tonight (TUES) on BBC4 at 10pm.
