The Belgian Foreign Minister has given carte blanche to anyone planning to follow in Gerard Depardieu's footsteps and move to Belgium in an attempt to escape higher French taxes.

'If other French people want to come to Belgium, I'm not at all opposed,' Didier Reynders said in an interview with Le Figaro.

He emphasised that France shouldn't be blaming Belgium if some residents, one of the leading lights of national cinema among them, are leaving the country.

Leaving: French actor Gerard Depardieu has put his Paris mansion up for sale and will leave France in protest at tax hikes imposed by the government

'…It is totally fallacious to believe
that we Belgians would do everything to attract the French. No! It 
turns out that for years, France has freely chosen a tax system that 
carries consequences and led the French to leave the country,' he added.

Earlier this week 'Cyrano de 
Bergerac’ star Depardieu said he was renouncing his French citizenship 
over the 'insulting' criticism and accusations of tax evasion he faced 
after announcing plans to move to Belgium.

Location: The 64-year-old actor's lavish new home in Belgian the village of Nechin - on a street known as Millionaire's Row - is less than two minutes drive from the French town of Roubaix

Exiles: Around a third of the 2,000-strong population of Nechin is 
French with many fleeing a looming new tax of 75 per cent on all 
earnings over one million euros

New financial measures: French President Francois Hollande has imposed a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent

'I don't ask for approval, but I 
could at least be respected!' Depardieu wrote in an open letter to Prime
Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.

'All those who have left France have not 
been insulted as I have been,' the actor noted.

His words referred to Prime Minster 
Jean Marc Ayrault's comment when called Depardieu's decision to leave 
France 'pathetic', accusing the actor of an attempt to avoid taxes.

'I am surprised by the tone used 
against French citizens. Myself, I could be very direct in regard to 
some Belgians who left for Monaco or elsewhere in search of a tax haven.

'But I've never used any epithets blaming them personally… What I heard 
in France are words that we would never use in Belgium, even when we are
really angry. It is a fierce debate,' Reynders told Le Figaro.

Earlier it was reported that the 
actor had acquired property in the Belgium village of Nechin.

'Le Soir 
newspaper said that Depardieu's new neighbors could include the Mulliez 
family, a billionaire clan that owns the giant French retail chain 
Auchan.

Up to 27 per cent of Nechin’s 
inhabitants are French, according to France's Le Point magazine. Wealthy
families flocked to Belgium after French

President François Hollande announced a large tax increase for the country's highest earners.

Belgium has become a tax haven for France's rich, as it doesn’t impose a wealth tax on its residents.

Luxury mogul Bernard Arnault – 
France's richest man – applied for Belgian citizenship after the 
Government proposed a 75 percent tax rate for top earners which is due 
to be introduced in 2013.
