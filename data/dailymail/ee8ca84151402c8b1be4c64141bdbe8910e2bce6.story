Think you can come up with a Champions League last 16 dream team picking one player from each side? Harder than it might, initially, sound.

As Europe’s elite competition moves into the knock-out stages, Sportsmail has endeavoured to devise the best squad - 11 players plus five substitutes - from all 16 remaining teams. The only rule is that only one player from each team can be chosen.

Goalkeeper: Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich)

Without doubt Neuer is the best goalkeeper on the planet and there is no competition for a place between the sticks when he is involved. Conceded just four goals in Bayern Munich’s six tough group stage games against Manchester City, Roma and CSKA Moscow.

Right-back: Benedikt Howedes (Schalke)

The Schalke captain and World Cup winner with Germany makes it in at right back. Howedes, who played every single minute of the World Cup in Brazil, can play consummately across the back four and has been one of the stand-out defenders in the Champions League this season.

Centre-back: Vincent Kompany (Manchester City)

There are few better in world football at the heart of a defence than Manchester City captain Kompany. There were a number of City attacking options who narrowly missed out on selection - Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero were two strong contenders - but Kompany’s presence at the back earned him a place.

Centre-back: Thiago Silva (Paris Saint-Germain)

Silva was practically the whole of Brazil’s defence in the World Cup. They conceded seven in five games with him in the side, then seven in one game without him as they were crushed by Germany in the semi-final. He has continued that form for Paris Saint-Germain and has been their best defender this season.

Left-back: Alex Sandro (Porto)

The Brazilian was the best left-back in the group stages. Subject to scouting from Manchester United and Chelsea, he is a threat going forward with his pace and crossing ability and equally strong defensively.

Central midfield: Paul Pogba (Juventus)

The 21-year-old is one of the hottest properties in the game. Comfortable in attack and defence, he would sit alongside Matic but remain the more offensive of the central, holding midfielders. Pogba is prone to making astonishing things happen on the pitch. 

Paul Pogba has been in scintillating form for Juventus this season and is the driving force in midfield

Central midfield: Nemanja Matic (Chelsea)

Every attack-minded team needs a midfielder prepared to sit in front of the back four and act as a shield, and Matic has proven this season at Chelsea he is formidable in that role. The tall Serbian is phenomenal at breaking up opposition play with tackles and interceptions.  

Nemanja Matic has established himself as Chelsea's tour de force in their midfield since re-joining the club

Attacking midfield centre: Lionel Messi (Barcelona)

Messi is told he is not the world’s best player, instead the accolade going to Ronaldo last month, so he replies with 14 goals in eight games including two hat-tricks. He is another who is an obvious choice, in behind the striker, in this side.

Attacking midfield right: Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid) 

The Ballon d’Or winner is a cert for his favoured right wing position. His 38 goals in 35 games this season, and the fact him not scoring for the past three games is verging on crisis, says it all. There is no contest.

Attacking midfield left: Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger can’t stop purring over his new signing and he is unquestionably their strongest player since his move from Barcelona in the summer. In a competition with a plethora of potential forward players, the Chilean just makes it in on the left of the attacking midfield trio.

Alexis Sanchez hit the ground running for Arsenal when he arrived from Barcelona and has not slowed down

Striker: Luiz Adriano (Shakhtar)

Unexpectedly, a Shakhtar Donetsk player is leading the line. Adriano cannot be overlooked after his nine goals in the group stage helped the Ukrainian club through to the last 16 and put him top of the scoring charts. He also had a hand in six other goals, playing a part in every single goal his side scored.

Substitutes  

Goalkeeper: Danijel Subasic (Monaco)

Almost made it into the starting XI after conceding just one goal in the six group stage matches. That’s five clean sheets. Remarkable.

Centre back: Sokratis (Borussia Dortmund)

The Greek defender has been immense at the back for the Bundesliga side in Europe, despite their struggles in the Bundesliga, and even weighed-in with a goal in the last round of the Champions League.

Centre back: Emir Spahic (Leverkusen)

Spahic was at centre of one of the leanest defences in the tournament so far, conceding just four goals, and was one of the form players of the group stages.

Attacking midfield: Koke (Atletico Madrid)

Hard to leave Koke out of the first team, and not to include one of last year’s finalists, but he has been arguably their best player and there were too many stronger players ahead of him.

Forward: Breel Embolo (FC Basel)

The exciting teenager from Cameroon, who only turned 18 two days ago, has already scored six in nine league starts for the Swiss side including a Champions League goal to his name against Ludogorets.
