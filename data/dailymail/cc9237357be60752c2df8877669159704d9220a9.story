It looks like an image from a thriller - millions of silver silken webs stretched over a vast expanse of an empty nature reserve.

But the intricate constructions are actually the work of money spiders who have released the silk webs as part of an elaborate escape plan. 

The mass of gossamer strands were found spread over a 130 feet wide area of scrub and grassland at a nature reserve in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex.

A mass of silken gossamer threads have been found stretched across 130 feet of an East Sussex nature reserve, woven by tiny money spiders

They have been constructed by millions of money spiders who climb to the highest possible point they can and release silk threads to form a triangular parachute which catches the breeze and lifts the spider into the air and away from the site.

The technique, known as ballooning, allows the tiny spiders, which measure around 5mm long, to travel far further than they could manage on foot. 

Ross Lawford and his 14-year-old nephew James found the mass of threads while out walking at the reserve.

The 33-year-old, an amateur wildlife photographer, said: 'Me and my nephew were out for a walk when we came across this huge sea of webs. My nephew was stunned by the sheer mass of them, covering a massive area of flood plain, trees and gates.

It must have been about 30 to 40 metres in length.

'My nephew just said "wow, it's a sea of spiders." All the webs were covered in spiders, which made my nephew a little worried.

The mass of fibres covers a flood plain, tree and gates at the nature reserve and looks like a mysterious sea of interwoven webs to onlookers   

Dozens of spiders can be seen on the webs and the mass is so large it probably would have taken millions of money spiders to construct it 

'I've been walking in that area with him since he was little and we've never seen anything like it.'

The size of the sea of webs means it would have taken millions of spiders to construct them. 

The fibres are usually seen when dew condenses on them but the sight is likely to be short lived as they usually disappear when wildlife and rain and wind break through them.  

Jess Price, a conservation officer at Sussex Wildlife Trust, said: 'This is gossamer, which is the name for the silver sheets of silken webs that remain when millions of money spiders balloon away from a site at the same time.

'Money spiders are tiny arachnids that often appear on your clothes and cars at this time of year.

The sea of webs is made up of gossamer silken threads and would have been produced by spiders making the most of the warmer conditions

The mass of webs, created in triangular shapes, are used by money spiders for ballooning, which allows the 5mm arachnids to travel further 

Ross Lawford discovered the strange sight with his 14-year-old nephew who described its appearance as a sea of spiders and their webs 

The thin gossamer fibres are usually seen on a morning when there is dew around but are usually destroyed by the weather and animals 

'They climb up as high as they can, point their abdomen into the air and start releasing silk threads.

'These quickly form a parachute shape which catches the breeze and lifts the spider into the air. These tiny money spiders can travel much farther distances by ballooning than they ever could on foot.

'In this area there will have been millions of money spiders that created this amount of gossamer.

'The mild weather this year has meant that it has generally been a very good spider year, as there have been lots of invertebrates to eat.

'Gossamer is most commonly seen on autumn morning when dew condenses on the threads making it glisten in the sunlight, otherwise you might easily not notice it.

'Soon the weather and general wildlife will break through lots of the threads so that the gossamer gradually fades away.'
