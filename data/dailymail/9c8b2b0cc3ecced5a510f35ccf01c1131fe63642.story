For football fans, transfer deadline day can be the most-anticipated event of the year.

It gives struggling clubs a chance to bolster their squad once last time - and teams at the opposite end of the table the opportunity to get even stronger.

But they only have until 11pm on Monday to do so! Here, Sportsmail examines what questions will be answered once the clock strikes that very time.

1 - Will Arsene Wenger land a striker?

With Olivier Giroud injured and Yaya Sanogo doing a weekly impression of Bambi on Ice, Arsenal are desperate for additional firepower. 

They missed out on Loic Remy, who signed for Chelsea on Sunday, and fellow target Alessio Cerci is set for Atletico Madrid.

So, will Arsenal stump up Radamel Falcao’s £12million loan fee, does he have another name in mind or will he frustrate fans and stubbornly refuse to spend?

Missed out: Loic Remy joined Chelsea instead of Arsenal but who will Arsene Wenger turn to next? 

2 - Can Manchester City lure Falcao from Monaco?

Arsenal might want Falcao but they are not alone. 

Manchester City would love to bring him to the Etihad and with Alvaro Negredo agreeing to join Valencia on loan they could avoid any financial fair play regulations. 

If City get Falcao they will surely be favourites to pip Chelsea to the title.

Should I stay or should I go? Radamel Falcao is linked with joining both Arsenal and Manchester City

Loan: Alvaro Negredo joining Valencia would open up the door for Falcao according to Financial Fair Play rules

3 - Which United flops will be shown the door?

Javier Hernandez is off to Real Madrid and Shinji Kagawa has rejoined Borussia Dortmund but who else can Louis van Gaal shift? 

Danny Welbeck (Everton and Spurs), Tom Cleverley (Hull, Aston Villa and Valencia) and Anderson (is anyone desperate enough?) could yet leave.

Leaving? Manchester United and England striker Danny Welbeck is on Everton and Tottenham's shortlists

4 - Do Louis van Gaal and Ed Woodward have enough charm to save United’s squad?

Apart from up front, United are desperate for reinforcements, despite the arrival of Daley Blind from Ajax. They need a right back and a centre back, and a tough-tackling midfielder would not go amiss. 

Sporting’s William Carvalho fits that bill, though don’t be surprised if there are no more big arrivals.

You'll do nicely: William Carvalho fits the bill for what Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal needs

5 - Will Petr Cech end his Chelsea career?

He’s won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and a whole lot more, but is Petr Cech’s glove affair with Chelsea set to end? 

And if so, will he find a club in time? Paris Saint-Germain are very keen on him and Monaco have shown interest, too. 

Chelsea have one too many foreign players for their 25-man squad, so need to shift someone.

The end? Goalkeeper Petr Cech could leave after becoming second-string to Thibaut Courtois at Chelsea

6 - How many bodies can Neil Warnock get in at Palace?

Tony Pulis left Palace because of disagreements over transfers. Warnock has just a few hours left to shore up his squad with Wigan midfielder James McArthur top of his list. 

Having played for him at Bury, Sheffield United, Leeds and QPR, it might be worth Paddy Kenny sitting by the phone, too. OK, maybe not.

Thinking cap on: New Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock will keep his eyes open on transfer deadline day

7 - Can Daniel Levy resist a deadline-day deal?

It wouldn’t be deadline day without Tottenham trying to make dramatic late signings. Daniel Levy loves a bargain and is a shrewd negotiator. And after watching his side being dismantled by Liverpool, he might be persuaded to get more involved than before. 

Danny Welbeck is a target to come in while Sandro, Aaron Lennon and Vlad Chiriches could leave.

Any bargains? It wouldn't be deadline day without Tottenham's Daniel Levy trying for dramatic late signings

8 - Will Jermain Defoe play for Harry Redknapp again?

He’s only been in Canada a few months and he’s out with a groin injury at the moment, but Jermain Defoe is hoping he can be reunited with Harry Redknapp. 

The QPR boss always gets the best out of the former England striker and they need a replacement for Loic Remy.

Together again? Jermain Defoe may rejoin Harry Redknapp at QPR as a replacement for striker Remy

9 - Does Micah Richards want first-team football?

Nine Premier League appearances in the past two seasons is not something Richards will be proud of. 

So will he follow Jack Rodwell’s path and leave Manchester City for Sunderland? He is only 26 and needs to prove that he is hungry to play again.

Fancy first-team football, Micah? Richards could follow Jack Rodwell from Manchester City to Sunderland

10 - Who will win the race for Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk?

With a cool name like Virgil, you can see why so many clubs want Van Dijk. 

Celtic are insistent that he is going nowhere but Southampton are determined to seal an £8m deal. 

If they don’t, Newcastle and Sunderland are also interested. After conceding six against Chelsea, maybe Everton should be, too.

En route? Virgil van Dijk is wanted by Southampton on an £8m deal but Celtic insist he's going nowhere
