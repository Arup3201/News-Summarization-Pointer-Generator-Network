David Meyler will accept Alan Pardew’s apology when the pair come face to face for the first time since the Newcastle boss headbutted him in March.

Pardew will seek out the Hull midfielder at St James’ Park on Saturday afternoon and offer him his hand – rather than his brow – in an effort to make up with the Republic of Ireland international.

Meyler will be only too happy to shake hands with the United manager, insisting he wasn’t fazed by the incident.

Meyler says that he will accept Pardew's apology when the pair come face to face on Saturday

‘What's the point of me dwelling on it? It's done, it's dusted,’ he said. ‘I come from a big GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) background, I played a lot of hurling and Gaelic football growing up as a kid and you used to get belted as a kid all the time.

‘That's just the way it was. I used to live and breathe that. You would go home and your hands would be cut, your legs would be cut.

‘I was more annoyed because we lost 4-1. I flew home with my father and we never spoke about it once. We spoke about the game. The incident was nothing. You've got to move on. You can't keep thinking about it.’

Newcastle were leading 3-1 at the KC Stadium when Meyler attempted to retrieve the ball from in front of the visiting dugout, only to be confronted by Pardew.

His actions cost him a £100,000 club fine, £60,000 FA fine and a seven-game touchline ban, which included three matches excluded from the stadium.

Pardew was sent to the stands by Kevin Friend and handed a seven-game ban for the altercation 

Newcastle fined their manager after the headbutt and his job is now under threat at St James' Park 

But Pardew – whose position is under threat with the Magpies bottom of the table - said: ‘Obviously I have had to change. It is an incident I apologised for and regretted.

‘I have not seen him since. I will shake his hand and I am sure he will smile at me. It is something I’d like to think that I have learnt from.’

And Meyler reflected: 'Of course I was surprised, I think everyone was.

‘At the time, we were 3-1 down. When the ball went over that way, I just rushed to get the ball back because I wanted to try and get us back into the game. Obviously the rest is history.

‘The FA dealt with it in their own way and Newcastle did too, it's done, it's forgotten about. He served his ban and he was fined heavily. He will be annoyed with himself. I just had to worry about the game, losing 4-1.’

Hull won 3-2 on Tyneside last season and a repeat performance is Meyler’s prime concern.

‘Their fans want a change (of manager) - that's up to them,’ said the former Sunderland schemer, speaking ahead of the launch of EA Sports FIFA 15.

‘I'm a Hull City footballer. I'm not too bothered about what happens at Newcastle. Please God, we will just beat them and take three points. We think we can beat them.’
