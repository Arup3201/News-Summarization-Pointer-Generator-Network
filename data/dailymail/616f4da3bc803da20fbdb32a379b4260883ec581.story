Pupils should not worry about their exam results because no one will remember them in years to come, the head of a leading girls’ school has said.

Judith Carlisle, headmistress of Oxford High School, said there was no point fretting over GCSEs because no one will ‘give a damn’ about results – and because they don’t  reflect character.

She is running a ‘Death of Little Miss Perfect’ initiative at the private school to combat perfectionism in her students.

Headmistress Judith Carlisle is telling pupils not to worry about their GCSE results in a bid to wipe out 'perfection'

‘Perfectionism is only captured in a moment – it’s not achievable longer term,’ she said. ‘It undermines self-esteem and then performance.

‘In five years’ time, no one will give a damn which GCSE [grade] you got in French.’

Miss Carlisle said that students don’t always need to aim for 100 per cent, and if they do need an A grade to attend their university of choice, it’s not necessary to get the highest A possible.

She said: ‘It matters, but sometimes it probably won’t matter. It’s very important to have an insurance offer [for a university that requires lower grades].

‘It’s a good discipline to have your contingency plan in place. Don’t aim for Oxford if not getting in will destroy you – or if going will destroy you, but that’s another thing entirely.

‘It’s important [the girls are] not going for things that if they don’t get it, it will destroy them. Exams aren’t who they are – it’s what they did on that day.’ 

The headmistress, who runs Oxford High, a £13,000-a-year girls' school, 
said no-one would 'give a damn' what pupils got in French GCSE later 
down the line - and that exams were only 'what (pupils) did on that day'

Miss Carlisle is trying to teach her students about the importance of failure, where ‘the real failing is failing to have a go’.

She said: ‘There’s unhelpful perfectionism as opposed to high standards. It’s not that we’re aiming to undermine high standards – it will actually help you achieve higher standards.

‘It’s about the principles that every parent wants, that their children grow up as happy as they can be and as robust as we can get them to be, and that they learn more by failing and not getting it right.

Unhappy people can’t learn anything anyway.’

Miss Carlisle said her school had brought in a series of methods to teach the girls about perfectionism, such as introducing online tests where it is impossible to get 100 per cent.

Mobile phones have been banned from school trips to teach girls to ‘live in the moment’. And lessons on personal health and social education have been dedicated to the topic of perfectionism.

‘We’ve all adopted a shared language as well,’ Miss Carlisle said. ‘We’re stopping them from answering questions by saying “I expect this is wrong but…”. We all say we’re not doing that.’

Pupils are also receiving group cognitive behavioural coaching, where they learn psychological principles of changing the negative voice in their heads.
