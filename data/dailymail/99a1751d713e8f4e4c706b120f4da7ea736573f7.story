Engineers have had to test Honda cars on a copy of a UK road to see if the Japanese vehicles are robust enough to survive motoring conditions here.

The four-mile test track at the Takasu centre in Hokkaido cracks easily and is noisy to drive on.

It has sharp turns like those found on many rural highways and can recreate the sub-zero temperatures found in winter, the Exaro website reported.

A genuine UK pothole: Japanese car maker Honda has had to build a special test facility to recreate the terrible conditions on British roads, like this one in the Sefton Park area of Liverpool

For added realism, it even has UK road signs and roundabouts.

Honda said the track was necessary because British roads absorb more water than the harder surfaces used in continental Europe.

When this water freezes, it expands and cracks road surfaces, resulting in the classic English pothole.

Paul Watters, from the AA, described the development as a ‘sad indictment’ of the British road system. He said: ‘Unfortunately, it seems potholes are here to stay, so car manufacturers are right to invest in trying to prepare cars for the conditions here.’

A Honda spokesman said: ‘The road surfaces in continental Europe, especially in the North, are paved with hard material that does not absorb water.

‘This is because, in severe winter, absorbed water in the material may freeze, turn into ice and destruct the roads.

Round and round: The company's test track in Hokkaido also includes unique features of British roads like roundabouts, which rarely appear along the highways of other countries

‘England does not tend to suffer with this severe winter, and so the surface is made with softer materials with many pores to absorb rain to prevent a slippery surface.

‘As a result, UK roads have a rougher surface, which creates more road noise than other European roads.

‘What Honda wanted to replicate in Takasu was this type of road surface.’

Poor road surfaces have often been 
blamed for hefty repair bills and last year local councils in Britain 
had to pay out nearly £23million in compensation to drivers whose cars 
have been damaged by potholes.

But,
 Honda says, the main reason for building their four-and-a-quarter mile 
track - which is so realistic it even includes UK road signs - is to 
mimic the soft road surfaces of British roads.
