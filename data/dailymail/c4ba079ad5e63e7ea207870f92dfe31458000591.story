A five-year-old boy from Long Island became the youngest-ever hiker to complete the Appalachian Trail on Friday when he and his family reached Harper's Ferry, West Virginia after a months-long trek.

Christian Thomas, also known as Buddy Backpacker, started the 2,180 mile trail, which stretches from Maine to Georgia, on April 27.

Despite a hiccup caused by the government shutdown, Buddy managed to finish his continent traversing feat in less than a year.

Buddy had travel companions in his parents Dion Pagonis and Andrea Rego, who gave up life behind a desk to give the five-year-old a taste of adventure.

Through frigid temperatures, a government shutdown and even a hurricane, the family beat all odds and completed the trail where the started it--in Harper's Ferry, West Virginia.

'Itâ€™s official,' read the heart-warming post on the official Buddy Packpacker website. They have finished every mile and they are now thru hikers!'

'Congratulations, Buddy Backpacker,' the post continues. 'You are amazing and we are so proud of you!'

Thru
 hiker is a term used to differentiate between day hikers--who do chunks
 of the trail or hike it piecemeal--and those who attempt to go the 
distance and hike the entire trail in one fell swoop.

'ItÂ¿s official,' read the heart-warming post on the official Buddy Packpacker website. 'They have finished every mile and they are now thru hikers!'

On track: Five-year-old Buddy Backpacker could become the youngest hiker to successfully make the over 2,000 mile journey

Lessons: The rambunctious little boy got lessons in math, science and other subjects from his parents as they hiked the trail

Homeward bound: The family had about 600 miles to go back in November and have now reached the coveted goal

Journey: Buddy hiked the 2,180-mile trail with his parents Dion and Andrea

Impressive: Christian's trail name was Buddy Backpacker. He and his family made many friends along the way as they trekked from Maine to Georgia beginning last April

At 2,180 miles long, hiking the Appalachian Trial is a major accomplishment that anyone, let alone a 5-year-old boy, would be proud of

Nom de trail: Many hikers following the route use trail names, which is how five-year-old Christian came to be known as Buddy Backpacker

The family camped along the route or stayed in hostels, and Buddy Backpacker - Christian's trail name -  learned to count, spell and do math along the way.

'I don't think we knew that he was setting the record officially until after we started,' Rego told WCYB 5.

At 2,180 miles long, the Appalachian Trial is one of the longest continuous footpaths in the world.

It covers 14 states between Maine and Georgia, with the largest section, of about 400 miles, in Virginia.

About 2,000 'thru-hikers' - those completing it in one journey - start the trail each year but only one in four make it to the end.

The total elevation of the mountainous trail is the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest 16 times.

On average, a hiker burns up 6,000 calories a day on the trail.

Most thru hikers start in Georgia in the spring, making the best of the weather before reaching Maine in fall.

The first person to ever complete the route was Myron Avery, when he plotted its path in 1936.

Many hikers following the route use trail names, which is how five-year-old Christian came to be known as Buddy Backpacker.

When they started their journey at 
the Appalachian Conservancy Center in West Virginia, they were told that
 the youngest person to ever complete the trail was a six-year-old who 
hiked it in 1980.

The couple hadn't set out to break any records. On their website, where they post updates about Buddy's 
progress, the hikers describe themselves as: 'A couple in
 our late twenties trying to figure out how it is you raise another 
human being'.

The group traveled light, with the main luxury item being an iPad Mini that they used to plot their route and find shelters along the way.

They also had a Jeep to get them to the trail heads each day, a tent that sheltered them through all kinds of weather, and a Marmot rain jacket to protect Buddy on windy trails.

Instead of going to school Buddy had the outside world as his classroom and listens to educational CDs.

'He hikes with educational music, he's 
learning French, he's learning to count, spell, add and subtract while 
he hikes without the distraction of other kids or being in the 
classroom,' Rego said.

The couple added that unlike other 'thru-hikers' Buddy's age gave him the advantage of unlimited energy.

Competition: The family was told that back in 1980, a 6-year-old completed the trail. Now Christian has won the title

Rare: About 2,000 'thru-hikers' - those completing it in one journey - start the trail each year but only one in four make it to the end

High life: While other children are at school, Buddy had his lessons at the top of mountains

Pit stop: Buddy stops for lunch. On average hikers consume up to 6,000 calories a day on the Appalachian Trail

'He never hurts the next morning like most 
thru-hikers do. His regeneration is overnight. He's had it easier than 
most hikers,' Pagonis, a graphic designer, said.

The couple's positive experience hiking with their young son inspired them to create the Hikes for Tykes fundraising page, to provide equipment and funding for other families wanting to follow in their footsteps.

Since starting in spring the family, who had to weather Hurricane Irene in their tent, made excellent progress. 

The government shutdown forced them to detour briefly, but they were not deterred from their goal.

Buddy said: 'We started in Harpers Ferry. We went 
to Maine, then to Baxter State Park to Katahdin, and then to Rockfish 
Gap, but the Shenandoah was closed.'

The
 family plans to turn the adventures of their youngster, who has scaled 
mountains, camped in snow and met wild horses, into a children's books.
