Martin Odegaard is due to visit Manchester United and Manchester City over the next week.

The highly-coveted 16-year-old is due to report back for pre-season training at Stromsgodset on January 6 and wants to have visited all the major clubs chasing his signature by then.

The Norway midfielder has already visited United for a training session earlier in the year but is likely to train with the first team to see how he fares.

Martin Odegaard is set to visit Manchester United and Manchester City this week as the Stromsgodset youngster chooses which club to join. Bayern Munich and Liverpool are also interested in the 16-year-old star

Odegaard has already been capped three times for Norway, including this appearance against Bulgaria 

City have a tie-up with Stromsgodset already but the Norwegians say the player will make up his own mind independently.

Bayern Munich believe they are favourites still to sign the promising midfielder but he is understood to have enjoyed his two days at Liverpool - the club he supported as a boy - also.

Odegaard is the youngest player in the history of the European Championship after coming on in Norway's win over Bulgaria at the age of 15 years and 300 days.

Odegaard is visiting all the clubs interested in him before deciding which one to join
