The cookie diet is being endorsed by a U.K. doctor who is suggesting it is prescribed by the NHS

A British doctor is calling on the NHS to prescribe a radical new diet for obese children - which encourages youngsters to eat nine biscuits a day.

Currently three in 10 children in the UK aged between two and 15 are overweight and many are in severe danger of developing heart disease.

Dr Sarah Brewer is recommending that the NHS, including GPs, prescribe a controversial U.S. diet comprised of eating cookies, as well as fruit and vegetables for dinner, to tackle the problem.

The diet says children can eat nine biscuits spread across the entire day, plus a 500 to 700 calorie evening meal as long as they obtain their recommended daily quota of five fruits and vegetables.

Dr Brewer believes that such radical measures are needed to tackle the alarming pattern of chronic obesity that faces British children.

She said: 'The size of the UK's childhood obesity crisis is staggering and it's 
time for decisive action.

'Many different approaches have been tried but,
 so far, traditional approaches have failed to make an impact.

'It's
 time we tried a new approach and while extreme diets should be a last 
resort for our children, too many British kids are already facing up to a
 life of medical problems and misery.

'If we can't 
recreate the old days of healthy eating and children playing in the 
great outdoors more often, we have to take a 21st century approach to a 
21st century problem.

The cookie diet encourages children to eat nine healthy biscuits a day - as long as enough fruit and vegetables are also consumed

'Let's swap the unhealthy snacks kids are currently
 eating for a healthier version that helps them feel full yet comes in 
the reassuringly familiar shape of a cookie.'

The cookie diet was developed in the U.S. by Dr Sanford Siegal to help combat obesity in a new way.

Currently 3 in 10 children in the UK aged between 2 and 15 are overweight, and many are in severe danger of developing heart disease through overeating

The
 biscuits he recommends contain a healthy blend of hunger-satiating 
amino acids derived from milk, egg white, oatmeal, rice and other 
grains.

Made using rapeseed oil, they also provide healthy mono-unsaturated and essential fatty acids.

His approach has since become incredibly popular as a new-age diet throughout Hollywood and even Australia.

According
 to the company: 'The cookie diet's high protein, low sugar cookies are 
designed to fill you up without taking away your ability to enjoy the 
kind of snack food we all love tucking into.'

Numerous methods have been tried by the NHS and the government to tackle growing obesity, such as fitness routines and improved diets.

Some parents have turned to extreme measures, such as gastric band operations on the NHS, to help their children lose weight, with some children as young as 15 needingÂ  surgery.

Rather than going under the knife, Dr Brewer believes that every diet option should first be explored.

Dr Brewer said: 'Rather than putting children on the operating table, we should explore 
other weight loss options that have been shown to work in other 
countries.'

Recent headlines show that the childhood obesity crisis is reaching desperate levels in the UK, with 74 children under 11 being taken away from their parents by the authorities for being overweight.

In addition, 183 youngsters in England, Scotland and Wales have weighed in at 16 stone or more in the last 3 years.

Dr Brewer believes that older methods are not working, so the NHS must turn to newer, more creative methods to help stop the obesity crisis.
