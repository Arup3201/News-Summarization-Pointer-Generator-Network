If you’ve ever burnt your tongue sipping a fresh cup of coffee, this table could save your tastebuds.

Created by a Japanese data researcher, the thermal mapping table uses a projector with a thermal imaging iPhone case.

When items are placed on the table, the case  identifies even slight changes in temperature to reveal when a beverage is safe to drink.

The thermal table (pictured) was created by Japanese data researcher Ken Kawamoto, who projected light from a Flir One iPhone case onto a table using a process known as projection mapping

Designer Ken Kawamoto used a Flir One thermal imagine iPhone case, which costs around £250 (£390). 

In a video, a glass of ice water is shown turning the table blue, while a glass of hot water is shown turning it red.

Kawamoto also pours cold and hot water into a tray, to see how the liquids combine, and shows what a MacBook’s battery looks like under thermal imaging.

Projection mapping uses video projectors, but instead of projecting the image onto a flat screen it maps the light onto any surface.

This light scatters the pixels of an image, and turns any surface – in this case, a table - into an interactive display.

The process is also known as spatial augmented reality and video mapping, and is typically used for adverts.

The project can be created by anyone using a projector and Flir One case (pictured left). The case is fitted with its own battery and lasts for 2 hours continuous use on a single charge. Example image is pictured right

Mr Kawamoto began by turning the table into a display using the projector, before beaming images and light via the £260 ($349 in the US) Flir One iPhone case.

Using sensor technology originally developed for military night vision, Flir One converts heat to colour images in real time.

These images let users see in the dark, but also reveal slight differences in temperature.

For example, it can  detect minimal changes in temperature of just 0.1°C to show which areas of an object are hotter, or cooler, than others.

‘By projecting colours determined by the Flir One onto the surface of objects, you can see the temperature of objects visually,’ explained Mr Kawamoto on his YouTube channel.

‘Ice becomes blue, a glass containing hot water becomes red, and you can even see how ice water and hot water mix.’

The project can be created by anyone using a projector and Flir One case. The case is currently only available for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s.
