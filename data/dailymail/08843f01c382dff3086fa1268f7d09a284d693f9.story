Last week when news of her new relationship broke, it seemed that Elin Nordegren had finally been able to move on from her traumatising divorce from Tiger Woods and had found happiness once again.

But the 31-year-old's new romance has taken a shocking twist, after it was claimed that her boyfriend Jamie Dingman, had also allegedly enjoyed trysts with Tiger's former mistress, Rachel Uchitel.

Elin is said to be fuming over the allegations, despite the businessman's denials.

No escape? Elin Nordegren is understood to be furious of the allegations that her new boyfriend Jamin Dingman had an affair with Rachel Uchitel, former mistress of her ex-husband Tiger Woods

According to celebrity website TMZ, Jamie Dingman and Rachel Uchitel spent two and a half weeks together at the Miami home of his business partner Chris Barish in October 2009.

At the time Dingman was in a relationship with a model named Inez.

Friends of the wealthy investor has hit back at the claims, saying the Miss Uchitel is lying about the affair.

But others have allegedly told TMZ: 
'Jamie came into Rachel's room late at night twice and the two hooked up
... and they heard Rachel discussing it with Barish the morning after 
each liaison.'

TMZ also claims Rachel left Jamie when 
things started to heat up with Tiger, but the wealthy investor wasn't 
exactly broken up over the split and told Rachel: 'That's ok. I'll 
date his wife, Elin.'

In a further twist, at the time Barish allegedly was dating Jen Madden - the woman who sold the original story about Tiger's affairs to the National Enquirer.

According to the website, Miss Madden obtained much of her information from overheard conversations between the group.

Former model Elin has been quietly dating Dingman, the son of billionaire Michael Dingman, for several months.

Mistress: Miss Uchitel allegedly spent two and a half weeks with Dingman, who was in a relationship at the time, and informed him of her affair with Tiger woods

He has 
previously been linked to Princess Madeleine of Sweden and American 
actress Bridget Moynahan.

Jamie splits his time between China and the Bahamas where his father’s Shipston Group company is based. 

But despite his jet setting lifestyle, it appears he has still had time to visit Elin in her native Sweden.

It has also been said the pair first met at the Red Cross Ball in Florida last January attended by Princess Madeleine.

Battle: Uchitel, pictured in 2009 with her lawyer Gloria Allred, has returned most of the $10m 'hush money' she received after Wood's lawyers claimed she breached the agreement

Elin divorced golf ace Woods after it
emerged that he had been involved in a considerable number of 
extra-martial affairs which came to light in December 2009.

Although
she initially stood by him amidst the claims, she eventually filed for 
divorce and the couple’s marriage ended in August 2010.

The pair have two children together Sam, three, and two-year-old Charlie.

Elin, who walked away with $100million as part of her 
divorce settlement from Woods, is said to have been dating Jamie for months.

Rachel Uchitel was the first mistress to be outed, and was paid $10million in 'hush money' hours before she was set to hold a tell-all press conference.

It has emerged that Uchitel has returned most of the money, after being threatened with a lawsuit by Woods' lawyer Jay Lavely, who claims she has violated the confidentiality agreement by speaking to media and also going on reality show Celebrity Rehab for treatment for her 'addiction to love'.

Her lawyer Gloria Allred is said to have advised Rachel to return the money as she believed she would lose a 
court case, but now Rachel is threatening Allred with a malpractice 
suit.

She claims Allred struck the deal to ensure she received her legal fee rather than going to court and risking not getting paid if they lost.

In a statement, Allred said: 'I was not involved in any way in the allegations set forth in the TMZ story which appears today and which references me. 

'I have not had a conversation with or communicated with Jay Lavely about any client in more than a year.  I am reserving all of my legal rights and remedies against anyone who defames me.'
