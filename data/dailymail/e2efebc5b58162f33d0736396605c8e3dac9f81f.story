These fat cats, massive mutts and bloated bunnies are among the largest pets in Britain, spoiled and overfed they have ballooned to enormous proportions, but now  they are fighting it out to shed the pounds.

Pet Fit Club features 13 dogs, five flabby felines and three rotund rabbits, and are carrying a combined excess weight of about 30 stone - equivalent to more than 200 bags of sugar.

They will be fighting it out in the 
People’s Dispensary for Sick Animal’s (PDSA’s) annual competition to 
encourage owners across Britain to combat pet obesity.

The
line-up includes hefty hound Mizzy, the Bullmastiff, and mighty moggy 
Ulric - the two biggest ever finalists in the six month diet and 
exercise programme.

Ulric from Dorset tips the scales at 2 stone (12.65kg) - more than 
double his ideal size - while Mizzy from Derby weighs in at 11 stone 
4lbs (72kg) making her around 60 per cent too big.

Norwegian Forest cat Ulric - the 
heaviest cat ever to take part - regularly steals food from his sister 
Ulla who weighs less than half his bodyweight.

Owner Jan Mitchell says his obsession with food means she has resorted to feeding Ulla on a worktop to prevent Ulric getting his paws on it.

She said: 'Ulric is not very energetic and is too laid back for his own good. He will eat his own food and then his sister’s - then waddles around.

'I have to feed Ulla on the worktop as he can’t jump up on there - that’s the only place she can eat in peace.'

Morbidly obese Mizzy is the heaviest ever dog in Pet Fit Club which has been running almost a decade.

Owner Cheryl Pedley said: 'I simply didn’t realise how overweight she was, I thought her breed was supposed to be big so I just thought it was her natural size.

'She used to love long walks so I didn’t think anything of giving her big helpings, but after the vet explained the problems it was causing her I want to do everything I can to help her.'

Other pets battling the bulge include sweet-and-sour-chicken-loving Beetlejuice, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier from London which is 7 stone (44kg) and 48 per cent overweight and larger-than-life Labrador Tia, from Birmingham, who weighs over nine stone (58.2kg) and is 94 per cent overweight.

Another is tom cat Prince whose owner blames its love of ice cream on its 1st 2lbs (7.2kg) shape, making it 44 per cent overweight.

The fat fighters are all competing for the title of PDSA Pet Fit Club slimmer of the year and all fall into the category of obese or morbidly obese and desperately need to shed pounds to improve their quality of life.

PDSA vets and nurses are coaching the owners of each pet as they embark on their journey. The charity’s research has revealed over 18 million pets are being fed deadly diets.

If coupled with little or no exercise, their life-spans are often cut short by preventable, obesity-related conditions such as arthritis, diabetes and heart disease.

Elaine Pendlebury, PDSA senior veterinary surgeon, said: 'Obesity is one of the biggest welfare issues affecting pets in the UK today - and it is entirely preventable.

'Sadly, it also means daily misery for millions of pets who are feeling the strain from carrying too much weight.

'The owners of the pets in this year’s competition are taking the vital first step towards a healthy new future for their animals.

'This helps reduce the likelihood of an early grave due to obesity and its related health issues. The good news is it’s never too late to make a positive change to improve a pet’s quality of life.'

Pets carrying 20 per cent or more of their ideal body weight are thought of as obese, while pets carrying over 50 per cent are deemed morbidly obese.

A cat, dog and rabbit will be selected in September with each getting a year’s free supply of diet food with an overall winner also being awarded a pet-friendly break in the UK.
