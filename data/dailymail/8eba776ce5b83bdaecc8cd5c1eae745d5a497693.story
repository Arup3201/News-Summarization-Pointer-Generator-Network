Amid the fuss about Jose Mourinho’s return to Lisbon, Nemanja Matic was forgotten. At least, he was until the 34th minute when the former Benfica midfielder appeared unmarked to head Chelsea into the lead.

A less popular goalscorer it would have been hard to find inside Sporting Lisbon’s Estadio Jose Alvalade.

Matic used to play for their fierce city rivals and returned to spoil their first Champions League home game in six years.

For Chelsea it was a vital goal, giving them a grip on a game they had dominated without managing to punish Sporting, with Diego Costa among those guilty of wastefulness, although not to the same degree as Andre Schurrle.

Matic stepped forward to score his second of the season and his first Champions League goal for the club he re-joined in January for £21million.

It clinched Chelsea three points and issued a reminder of how critical the tall Serb has become to Mourinho’s team. While Costa and Eden Hazard take acclaim for their work in front of goal, Matic supplies the midfield power which allows them to attack with such freedom.

Amid all the fuss about Costa’s strike-rate and hamstrings and Hazard’s jinking dribbling skills, Matic is easily overlooked. Here was the perfect moment to hail his contribution for he is every bit as important as the goals of Costa or the jinking runs of Hazard.

Sporting were very disappointing until they went behind. They appeared to freeze but generated more urgency and purpose in the second half, when Chelsea’s defensive unit had to work to protect the lead.

Matic weighed in with some of the more familiar unsung stuff, eating up the miles, disrupting the game’s rhythms, winning the ball and the Londoners moved to the top of Group G with back-to-back ties next against Maribor of Slovenia, who drew at Schalke on Tuesday night.

‘We had to win,’ said captain John Terry after his 100th Champions League appearance. ‘It puts us in control again.’

Nani and Fredy Montero both went close in a closing phase which had no right to be as nervy as it was for Chelsea. They squandered the chances to win comfortably, starting in the second minute when Costa was released by Oscar.

Costa stormed clear on goal with oodles of time, perhaps too much time, and opted for a low shot which Rui Patricio saved with his left foot.

Patricio went on to perform brilliantly and Mourinho strode into his penalty area at the final whistle to offer his hand. Unlike Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert and his sidekick Roy Keane, Portugal’s No 1 shook it.

‘I’m not going to repeat what I said because the words would be censored,’ said the Chelsea boss. ‘It was something about spoiling the night.’

After thwarting Costa, Patricio frustrated Schurrle, who tried to sidle past him but the keeper scrambled across the turf to smother his shot.

He saved again from Schurrle, a more routine catch from a header after Naby Sarr, who endured a torrid night, had been dispossessed, and again, to keep out a low strike from the edge of the box.

It was shaping up like the Capital One Cup tie against Bolton when Schurrle had a dozen shots and could not score. Midway through the first-half he managed to screw an absolute sitter horribly wide.

Mourinho spun towards the bench, throwing his hands in despair. He knew Chelsea must score during this dominant period. The chance was made by Hazard, who sped past Sarr and picked out Schurrle, arriving from deep, completely unmarked. All he had to do was roll the ball into the net but somehow he missed the target.

Chelsea wastefulness kept Sporting in the game and Marco Silva had them drilled to break at pace and numbers. Thibaut Courtois was a bystander for much of the first-half but alert to save from Islam Slimani when he needed to be. 

Pressure was eased by Matic, when the Serb found space in a crowded goalmouth to apply a firm header to a free-kick delivered by Cesc Fabregas and looped over Patricio into the far corner.

There were similarities to the winner scored by Branislav Ivanovic in the Europa League final against Benfica, when Matic was on the beaten team.

Chelsea had a lead and went after the second, but it was no easier to acquire. Mauricio blocked from Costa, soon after the break, and Oscar was unable to beat Patricio when clean through on goal.

Another run by Costa was brutally halted by Mauricio, who managed to injure himself in the process. It might have been interpreted as a red-card foul by the last defender, but the referee gave him the benefit of the doubt and the centre-half left on a stretcher with a yellow. 

‘It’s understandable, no problem,’ said Mourinho. ‘It is a young team, young players, a big match for them. There was some frustration because we controlled most parts of the game. The game was hard but correct.’

Sporting summoned some quality in the second half. They were spirited and much more threatening and almost found a way back into the game. Nani crashed his best chance into the site-netting from an angle and curled another close, while Montero flashed a header wide.

Chelsea survived the scares and are well placed to win the group. ‘We can control our destiny,’ said Mourinho. ‘We play two games against Maribor and if we manage six points that would be 10 and job done.’
