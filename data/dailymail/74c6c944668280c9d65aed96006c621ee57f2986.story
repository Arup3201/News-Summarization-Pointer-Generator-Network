A prime suspect in the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher has been found alive by Libya’s new rebel leaders, it has been claimed.

Matouk Mohammed Matouk, the only one of three main suspects known to be still alive, reportedly tried to defect to the National Transitional Council as Tripoli fell ten days ago.

The new government has confirmed that it knows the whereabouts of Matouk, a former minister under Gaddafi, according to the Daily Telegraph.

In response to Libyan media claims that Matouk had been placed under arrest because of his long service to Gaddafi, Ali Tarhouni, the de facto deputy prime minister, denied it but said: ‘We know where he is.’

Matouk was named in Crown Prosecution Service papers as one of two suspects who could be charged in connection with the killing outside the Libyan Embassy in London in 1984.

Last night Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski, chairman of the all-party Libya group, called for him to be extradited as soon as possible, adding: ‘You can’t have British justice in a Libyan court.’

The discovery of Matouk comes as another suspect in WPC Fletcher’s murder, Abdulgader Baghdadi, was found shot dead in the chaos of Tripoli.

He was said to have helped plan the response of Libya’s London embassy to the demonstration outside which led to shots being fired and killing the 25-year-old police officer.

A member of Tripoli’s revolutionary council, Osama al-Abed, said yesterday that Baghdadi’s bullet-ridden body had been found in a suburb of the city last week.

Mr al-Abed said the body of the former embassy official was found among half a dozen other corpses. He said it was believed they had been slaughtered by fellow Gaddafi loyalists.

There has been no confirmation of the whereabouts of the third prime suspect, Abdulmagid Salah Ameri, a junior diplomat identified as being the gunman.

There have been claims, however, that Ameri is also dead.

Earlier this year the Daily Mail tracked down Omar Sodani, another who was implicated in the murder of WPC Fletcher, after he was captured by rebels.

It is unclear what has happened to him.
