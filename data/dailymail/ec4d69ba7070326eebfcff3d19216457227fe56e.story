The final text of President
Barack Obama's request to Congress for authority to use
force against Islamic State fighters is still in the works as
talks with lawmakers continue, the White House said Tuesday.

Obama
has said he would ask Congress for a formal Authorization to Use
Military Force (AUMF) for the fight, and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday the administration will have language to the Congress 'relatively soon.' 

A source familiar with the extensive discussions between White House officials and lawmakers over the past month told Reuters 'the final text of the AUMF and timing for delivery will not
be locked until we are able to complete these robust
consultations and consider all of the feedback we have
received.'

President Barack Obama will present Congress with a formal Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) request 'relatively soon,' the White House said today

Lawmakers and congressional aides said they expected to
receive language from the White House as early as Wednesday
giving at least an outline of what the administration would like
to see in an authorization.

Earnest said the text could come as early as this week but declined to give a specific date, telling reporters at his daily briefing, 'relatively soon would include any of the days that are remaining in this week.'

Both Republicans and Democrats said there had been unusually close consultations between the administration and Capitol Hillon the Islamic State AUMF. 

A major concern in drafting the language, the White House said today, was making sure that it would have bipartisan support. The president believes the message sent by the resolution's passage will be 'even more powerful' if Democrats and Republicans alike stand behind it.

The Obama administration official would preview the contents of the AUMF while acknowledging that it would fulfill the president's 'desire to see Congress act in support, or at least demonstrate their support for the strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.'

A tight-lipped Josh Earnest said the text could come as early as this week but declined to give a specific date, telling reporters at his daily briefing, 'relatively soon would include any of the days remaining in this week'

Kayla Mueller, 26, an American humanitarian worker from Prescott, Arizona is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters. Today U.S. President Barack Obama confirmed the death the U.S. aid worker who had been held hostage by Islamic State militants

Fueled by outrage over the death of aid worker Kayla
Mueller, the last-known U.S. hostage held by Islamic State
militants, as well as the slaying of journalists and a Jordanian
pilot, lawmakers say they planned quick hearings on the
authorization, and a vote within weeks of Congress' return from
a Feb. 16-20 recess.

'I think we ought to bring it to the floor relatively soon,
which I think we could do in March,' Representative Steny Hoyer,
the number two Democrat in the House of Representatives, told
reporters on Tuesday.

John Cornyn, the number two Republican in the Senate, told
reporters he appreciated Obama's consultations.

'I think it's really an important step, and I think Congress
will treat it with the sort of  gravity and seriousness that it
deserves,' he told a news conference.

The White House said it was 'hopeful' that Congress would pass the measure without delay. It also suggested that additional Americans may have been abducted by ISIS. Earnest admitted that 'at least' one more American was being held in captivity in the region - moments after using the plural term 'hostages.'

In a statement confirming Mueller's death today, the president shared his condolences with her family.

'At this time of unimaginable suffering, the country shares in their grief,' he said, detailing Mueller's humanitarian work in communities around the world.

'Kayla’s compassion and dedication to assisting those in need shows us that even amongst unconscionable evil, the essential decency of humanity can live on,' Obama said. 'She epitomized all that is good in our world.'

Continuing, the president said that Mueller's 'legacy endures, inspiring all those who fight, each in their own way, for what is just and what is decent' and promised to hunt down the terrorists who murdered her 'no matter how long it takes.'

'ISIL is a hateful and abhorrent terrorist group whose actions stand in stark contrast to the spirit of people like Kayla,' his statement said. 'On this day, we take comfort in the fact that the future belongs not to those who destroy, but rather to the irrepressible force of human goodness that Kayla Mueller shall forever represent.'
