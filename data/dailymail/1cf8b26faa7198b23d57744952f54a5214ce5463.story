A former Vanderbilt football player accused of raping an unconscious student was so drunk that 'he was not his normal self', an expert witness has testified.

Cory Batey, 20, is on trial in Nashville, Tennessee with his former teammate Brandon Vandenburg, 21, for allegedly sexually assaulting the neuroscience student with two other men in June 2013.

On Friday, the court heard Dr. James Walker, a forensic neuropsychologist testifying for the defense, that Batey's ability to 'act knowingly' was impaired after drinking between 14 and 22 drinks.

'He was so intoxicated he was not his normal self,' Walker said. 'He was doing things he would not normally have done.' 

'Not himself': Cory Batey, pictured listening to testimony during his rape trial on Tuesday, was so drunk when he allegedly raped a student in a dorm room that his judgment was impaired, the court heard on Friday

He drank enough to 'alter his judgment and his impulse control… his ability to think about consequences,' he said. 

Another expert, who did not testify, estimated that Batey's blood alcohol content would have been between 0.175 and 0.33 per cent, the Tennessean reported. The legal limit to drive is 0.08 per cent. 

Still, when he was first interviewed by police in connection with the alleged attack, he told them he had nothing to drink that night because he knew it was against campus rules.

Walker also testified that Batey, who had arrived on campus as a 'pretty upright moral young man', felt himself change because of the 'ease and availability' of young women around him.

His girlfriend reported that Batey had been sexually aggressive on one occasion but that he stopped when she asked him. 

'Ring-leader': Fellow football player Brandon Vandenburg listens to his alleged victim testify on Thursday

By his side: Vandeburg's family listens as the woman testifies how she awoke sore but not knowing what had happened the next day. The last thing she remembers was drinking with Vandenburg in a bar

He told Walker that he was 'horrified' by his actions on the night of the alleged attack and insisted that he had felt peer pressure.

After allegedly raping the woman - in a brutal attack that was captured in cell phone footage and sent to Vandenburg's friends - Batey spent the night with his girlfriend, the court heard.

Batey's defense team has said that his judgment was changed by a campus culture of binge drinking and promiscuous sex.

On Thursday, the court heard from two witnesses who said that DNA from multiple men were found on the victim's clothing, alluding to the promiscuous culture on campus.

The experts testified after the victim herself took to the stand and revealed that she could remember nothing about the attack because she had blacked out from drinking alcohol.

Co-accused: Former Vanderbilt players Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie (left) and Brandon Banks (right) also face charges connected to the alleged rape. McKenzie testified that he did not touch the woman

Injuries: Katherine Parnell, a nurse at Metro General who carried out a rape kit on the victim, said the young woman had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks, and scratches on her feet

A nurse testified about the bruises she found across the young woman's thighs and buttocks, but the alleged victim said she did not know the extent of the attack until she saw the cell video footage.

All four former players - Batey, Vandenburg, Jaborian McKenzie and Brandon Banks, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.

The trial wrapped up its tenth day on Friday. The defense has one more witness to testify on Monday and then closing arguments are set to begin.
