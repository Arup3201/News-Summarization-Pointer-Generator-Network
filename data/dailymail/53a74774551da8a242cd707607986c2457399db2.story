What better way to cool off on a hot summer's day than a large ice cream - and they do not come much bigger than this.

A 21 feet tall monster truck has been converted into an ice cream van and is touring Britain's most popular resorts to hand out free treats.

The souped up van weighs 5.5 tonnes and took a team of engineers over three weeks to make.

Children at Norfolk's Great Yarmouth beach were the first to sample free treats from the van, which is so big that youngsters had to stand on a step-ladder to reach the cones.

It boasts five foot high monster truck wheels to cope with the toughest of terrains and four mega speakers.

The van will give out 6,500 free ice creams at
 venues including Bournemouth's beaches, Newbury's Royal County of 
Berkshire Show and some of the Tour of Britain cycling stages.

It has been created by Skoda to mark the release of its Octavia vRS car and will feature in its latest television adverts along with other pimped-up gadgets.

They include a 'Man-Pram' - a six feet high baby buggy that boasts 20 inch alloy wheels, all terrain tyres, wing mirrors and headlights for night walks.

The super-sized ice cream van weights more than 5.5 tonnes and will give out 6,500 servings of free ice cream

It weighs more than 15 stone and comes complete with a hydraulic suspension, anti-stress push-bar grips, top-of-the-range brakes and brake lights.

Babies on board are treated to 'sports-style upholstery' and 'adjustable lumbar support' but its top speed depends on who is pushing it.

The range also includes a giant toy trike and lawnmower with multiple exhaust pipes.

Skoda's Heidi Cartledge commented: 'Our giant ice cream van will be touring the UK, handing out up to 6,500 servings of free ice cream.

'It is offering members of the public a fun sense of what you could experience if you vRS'd your life.'
