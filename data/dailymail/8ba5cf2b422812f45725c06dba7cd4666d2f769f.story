A pensioner who ran down her violent husband in a Nissan Micra after suffering years of domestic abuse has avoided jail after a judge heard that the troubled couple still love each other.

Sally Stickland, 72, could have killed her husband of 50 years when she ploughed into him as he walked along a country lane.

She then drove home, leaving 73-year-old John, the father of her three children, lying motionless and seriously injured on a grass verge where he was discovered by passers-by.

Sally Strickland, 72, right, was spared an immediate prison sentence despite deliberately running over her husband John, left, after a court heard they still 'loved each other deeply'

Judge Gary Burrell said ‘battered wife 
syndrome’ caused by years of violence may have led Stickland to commit 
the ‘dreadful incident’.

Despite their troubled relationship, 
however, the couple showed a united front in court where they claimed 
they planned to stay together.

The judge described how Stickland had 
used her car as ‘a weapon’ when she crossed to the other side of the 
road and hit her husband from behind. He was ‘lucky’ to have survived. 
She returned to the scene only after the emergency services called to 
say her husband had been hurt in a hit and run.

She was heard saying; ‘Do I have to go with him?’ as paramedics put her husband into an ambulance.

Lucky: Judge Gary Burrell, sitting at Southampton Crown Court, said Mr Stickland was lucky not to have been killed after his wife crossed from the other side of the road in her silver Nissan Micra and hit him

Neighbours
 of the couple spotted the silver car, its windscreen damaged, parked at
 a strange angle outside their £450,000 detached home in Langley, 
Hampshire, and grew suspicious.

Police seized the vehicle and arrested Stickland later that day, May 18.

She was charged with attempted murder, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of grievous bodily harm at a previous hearing.

At
 her sentencing on Monday her husband, who suffered fractures to his 
cheekbone, back and neck and a cut to his forehead, declared his love 
for her. Speaking at Southampton Crown Court, in front of a public 
gallery packed with family and friends, he said he has made a full 
recovery.

Mr Stickland added: ‘I love my wife and care for her very 
much.’ He said he did not want her to be kept away from him any longer –
 she has been ordered to stay away from the marital home since the 
incident. Simon Edwards, prosecuting, told how Stickland was driving on 
the eastbound side of the road before crossing to the other side.

‘It appears that his (Mr Stickland’s) head was in contact with the windscreen, resulting in damage to the windscreen,’ he said.

'The family remain united. Mr and Mrs Stickland still love each other deeply'

Statement from Stickland family

‘Mr
 Stickland would have been unaware of the approach of  the car behind 
him. At no stage did Mrs Stickland alert police to say she had been 
involved in any sort of accident.’

Judge Burrell sentenced Stickland to 
18 months in prison, suspended  for two years.

He told her: ‘There is
 a very unusual background to this dreadful incident. You suffer from 
post-traumatic stress syndrome and battered person’s syndrome.

‘Although
 you and Mr Stickland have been married for 50 years and have three 
children, what seems clear is that for a period of the relationship it 
was marred by violence, mainly on his part.

‘You previously sought 
help from domestic abuse services. As a result of that your emotional 
wellbeing suffered and so did your mental health.’

Judge Burrell 
made reference to an assault in 2004, when  Mrs Stickland was kicked in 
 the head by her husband, and  a 2011 attack, when he held her by the 
throat until she began  to lose consciousness. The court heard that she

occasionally retaliated.

The emotional couple embraced after hearing Stickland had avoided an immediate jail term, and left the building together.

Solicitor
 Janet Brownlow, reading a family statement outside court, said: ‘The 
entire family have found the last few months very difficult and are 
still coming to terms with the traumatic circumstances surrounding the 
incident and everything that has followed.

‘The family remain united.
 Mr and Mrs Stickland still love each other deeply and they understand 
the reasoning behind the judge’s sentencing.

‘The family wish to start to put all of this behind them and look forward to the future.’

Stickland also received a two-year residence order saying that she must live with her son and a 24-month supervision order.
