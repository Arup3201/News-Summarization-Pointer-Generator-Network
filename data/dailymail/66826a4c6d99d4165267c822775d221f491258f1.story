The most popular speaker at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference was not a politician, but rather Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson.

Robertson received a thunderous applause that brought the audience to their feet Friday as he accepted the Andrew Breitbart Defender of the First Amendment Award.

And in his remarks, that ran 20 minutes long, the polarizing reality star focused on one thing in particular - sexually transmitted diseases in America.

In his speech, Robertson slammed hippies and their culture for causing the 110million cases of STDs in Americans

'I hate to admit I got my facts from the CDC the day before yesterday, 110 million, 110 million Americans now have a sexually transmitted illness,' said Robertson.

'I don't want you, America, to get sick,' he added. 

'I don't want you to become ill. I don't want you to come down with a debilitating disease. I don't want you to die early. You're disease free and she's disease free, you marry, you keep your sex right there. You won't get sick from a sexually transmitted disease.'

Robertson then moved on to who he blamed for these diseases. 

'It is the revenge of the hippies! Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll have come back to haunt us in a bad way,' he stated.

He then went on to tell that audience that it only takes '30 seconds' to get genital herpes. 

Then, he said that the only way to end this was for a man to marry a woman or a woman to marry a man, and to stay faithful.

'You want a godly, biblical, medically safe option? One man, one woman, married for life,' he said.

Robertson kicked off his speech by quoting one of the founding fathers, as he told the audience; 'You lose your religion, according to John Adams, and there goes your morality. We're almost there.' 

Robertson closed out his speech by saying; 'And if you hate me because I told you that, I told you my love for you is not contingent on how you feel about me. I love you anyway. I don't want to see you die early or get sick. I'm trying to help you, for crying out loud. America, if I didn't care about you, why would I bring this up?

What Robertson failed to bring up however were his own infidelities.

Robertson's wife Kay stayed with his despite his affairs, and the two recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.

She too was there on Friday as her husband accepted his award, as was the couple's son Willie, who sat in the audience. 

Robertson, 68, is a devout Christian who made his millions inventing the Duck Commander, an instrument used by hunters that makes duck calls.

He previously came under fire when he denounced homosexual as 'sinful in a 2013 interview with GQ.

A&E, the network that airs Duck Dynasty, suspended him after these comments, but he was reinstated after the public, and politicians including Sarah Palin, attacked the move as a violation of his freedom of speech.
