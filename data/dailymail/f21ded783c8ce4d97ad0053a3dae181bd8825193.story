Regular girl Moffy appeared on the cover of cult magazine POP by chance this summer after she was recommended to the editor by a friend.

And now the accidental model's unconventional looks have earned her another big modelling gig, this time as the latest face of Storm Models - the agency which discovered Kate Moss.

Brunette Moffy suffers from strabismus - or cross eyes - and her distinctive looks are set to take the fashion world by storm.

Moffy is not like every other female model. She is young and beautiful, but also cross-eyed

Her debut shoot for Pop magazine featured young Moffy in an England football shirt and no make-up.

The photographer and editorial team were so impressed with the results that they put one of the images on the cover and dubbed her the face'.

Now Storm, who has signed the 32-26-32 unique beauty, are expecting great things.

Tyrone LeBon, the photographer who 
worked with her for POP, said: 'Moffy is a girl who my girlfriend Adwoa 
suggested to Max [Pearmain] and I.

'We chose to shoot her because we had recently shot with models and wanted a change. 'Moffy had never been photographed for a
 magazine and itâ€™s always exciting to work with someone where there is 
uncertainty about how it might work out.'

Her strabismus, a condition in which the eyes are not fully aligned with each other, earned Moffy recognition
