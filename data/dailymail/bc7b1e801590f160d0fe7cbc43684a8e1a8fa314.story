A 'tearful' Carla Bruni today spoke for the first time about the indictment of her husband Nicolas Sarkozy on corruption charges - saying the ordeal was 'painful'.Â 

Her words came on the same day that the judge conducting the case received a bullet in the post accompanied by a death threat. Jean-Michel Gentil has been subjected to numerous insults since deciding to prosecute the  58-year-old former French president.

While Sarkozy faces up to the prospect of a trial, his 45-year-old pop singer wife is promoting a new album.

In an interview with Le Parisien newspaper, she said a few words about Sarkozy, who is accused of taking millions from the frail l'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, 90.

'He's calm and combative,' said Ms Bruni, who was said to be wiping away a tear as she spoke.

'We will do everything to ensure that the truth comes out. But I really can't talk about it. It's as painful to talk about it, as it is painful not to talk about it. It is painful for the family.'

Referring to Ms Bettencourt's advanced years and poor mental state, Ms Bruni said : 'It is unthinkable to imagine that such a man could abuse the weakness of a woman who is the age of his mother.'

On Monday, Sarkozy himself spoke about the charges, which could see him spending up to three years in prison.

Last week he was placed under formal investigation for abusing the weakness of Mrs Bettencourt, who is the richest woman in the world.

In a highly emotional post on Facebook, Sarkozy said: 'At a time where I have to deal with an unfair and unfounded indictment, I want to thank from the bottom of my heart all those who wanted to show me their trust.'

He said: 'I want to say that at no time in my public life, have I betrayed my duties,' adding that he wanted to devote all his energy to 'demonstrate my integrity and my honesty. The truth will prevail. I have no doubt.'

The principal claim is that Sarkozy took advantage of the frail state of Mrs Bettencourt to persuade her to donate millions to his election campaign in 2007.

As well as prison, Sarkozy faces a fine of more than 300,000 pounds if he is found guilty of exploiting Mrs Bettencourt's weakened mental state.

Interviews with Ms Bruni, who still uses her name in her professional career despite being Sarkozy's third wife, currently dominate the French media because her new album of songs comes out shortly.

It is called 'Little French songs', and features references to a number of characters, including Sarkozy himself.
