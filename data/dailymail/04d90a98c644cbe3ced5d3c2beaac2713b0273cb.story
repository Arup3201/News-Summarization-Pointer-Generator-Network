DJ Adam 12, whose musical partner was left spinning the decks at Obama's fundraiser on Tuesday night, made a heartfelt plea to the MTV crowd to show their support in the run-up to the November 6 elections.

The President attended a 
fundraiser hosted by Beyoncé and Jay-Z at the hip-hop mogul's 40/40 Club in Manhattan where guests paid $40,000 a head.

Turning the tables: DJ Adam 12 spoke in support of the Obama campaign and urged voters to do what they can to support the President following a fundraiser hosted by Beyonce and Jay-Z on Tuesday in New York

The soiree, set against a 350 bottle champagne tower worth $105,00, was attended by 100 people. It took place after Obama spoke to 200 donors at a 
$12,500-per-family reception at the Waldorf Astoria. The total campaign 
cash haul for the day was $6 million.

DJ Adam 12 - otherwise known as Adam Bravin - is part of duo She Wants Revenge along with Justin Warfield who lined up tunes for the glittering New York bash on Tuesday evening.

Bravin told MTV: 'I think it sends an important 
message for Jay-Z and Beyoncé to throw this fundraiser... that it's 
important for people that support the president to actually support the 
president.'

He admitted that not everyone can afford to throw a multimillion-dollar fundraiser like Obama's A-list friends, but added: 'Everybody can do something, whether it's make some phone calls, knock on doors, have a little party of your own, throw a club, whatever it is you can do in whatever town that you're in, you should be doing that if you actually do support the president and you want him to be re-elected'.

Friends in high places: President Obama chats up Beyonce and Jay-Z at the $105,000 New York City champagne fundraiser the couple threw for him on Tuesday night

At the 40/40 Club, the singer Beyoncé introduced Obama and said that she and her husband Jay-Z 'believe in his vision'.

Obama said: 'Let me just begin by saying to Jay and Bey, thank you so much for your friendship. We are so grateful. Michelle and Malia and Sasha are mad at me because they are not here.

'That doesn’t usually happen. Usually they’re like, we’re glad you’re going – we don’t need to go. But every time they get a chance to see these two they are thrilled, partly because they are just both so generous, particularly to my kids. And Malia and Sasha just love both of them.'

Obama added that Beyonce 'couldn’t be a 
better role model for our daughters because she carries herself with 
such class and poise'.

Classy: Obama told the guests, including Solange Knowles, seen arriving for the event (right), that he couldn't think of a better role model for his girls than Beyonce, because of her 'poise' (pictured  with Jay Z last month)

40/40 Club: Obama also compared himself to Jay-Z at the event, saying he knows'what my life is like. We both have daughters, and our wives are more popular than we are.'

He then compared himself to Jay-Z. 'Jay-Z now knows what my life is like. We both have daughters, and our wives are more popular than we are. So we’ve got a little bond there. It’s hard, but it’s okay.'

Like him, Beyonce and Jay-Z came from humble backgrounds, he said. 'And the good thing about so many of us here – and I know, I speak for Jay and Bey – is we remember what it’s like not having anything, and we know people who were just as talented as us that didn’t get the same break, the same chance.

'We remember some of our parents or grandparents who came here as immigrants and got a little bit of help along the way to go to that school or be able to start that first business.'

Celebrity circles: The President also appeared on Letterman last night where he said he stands up for 'ALL America' following the 47% furor over Romney's secret tapes

Both Obama and his opponent Mitt Romney are frantically holding fundraisers even in the final stretch of the campaign to raise to avoid being swamped by attacks ads.

And it was at a $50,000-a-head fundraiser in Boca Raton, Florida some months ago that Romney made his controversial comments about his job being to not worry about the 47 per cent of Americans who do not pay income tax.

Obama accused Mitt Romney of 'writing off big chunks of the country' and rebuked his rival's claims that nearly half of all Americans believe they are 'victims' entitled to sponge off the government.
