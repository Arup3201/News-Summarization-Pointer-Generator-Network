Julianna Naylor has been jailed after she drove on the wrong side of a dual carriageway, while drunk and upset following a family wedding 

An accountant who got drunk at her father's wedding because she was upset that she was not sat with her newly discovered biological family then caused a head on crash when she got behind the wheel.

Julianna Naylor, 30, was more than three times over the legal drink drive limit when she drove the wrong way on the A90 dual carriageway near Kinfauns, Scotland. 

Naylor, who was so drunk she could not remember how she ended up on the wrong side of the trunk road linking Perth and Dundee, caused a head-on crash with a car which was overtaking a heavy goods lorry. 

She had been at her father's wedding earlier that day and was upset after she was put at a table a distance away from the rest of her family. 

Naylor had only recently been reunited with her biological father. 

She was jailed for six months and banned from driving for five years after she admitted the offence and accepted that she 'could have killed someone.'

Sheriff Lindsay Foulis told her: 'At the relevant time you were driving when the level of alcohol was more than three times over the legal limit.

'You managed to find yourself on the wrong side of the dual carriageway. Thinking it was a two way road you were driving in the outside lane of the dual carriageway.'

He added:  'You very frankly note that you could have killed someone and that you dread to think what could have happened. It is to your credit that you have that insight.

'There are a number of aggravating factors. You were considerably over the legal limit to drive. The element of dangerousness was not momentary. You have a previous conviction for an analogous matter.'

Naylor was jailed despite a number 'glowing testimonials' about her job and her overcoming a difficult background. 

She had a previous conviction for careless drunken driving in 2004.

Naylor of Errol, admitted driving while she was more than three times over the limit on 20 September last year.

She also admitted driving dangerously and on the wrong side of the dual carriageway before crashing into another car and causing extensive damage to both vehicles. 

 She crashed her Nissan Juke into the Ford Fiesta being driven by Stuart Paterson.

Fiscal depute Stuart Richardson said it was not clear how Naylor came to be going the wrong way and she was unable to offer any explanation to the court.

'Unfortunately, because of the alcohol taken she found herself on the wrong side of the road,' Mr Richardson said.

He said Mr Paterson was overtaking a lorry when he was suddenly confronted by Naylor's car in the outside lane coming towards him at speed. He managed to take partial evasive action and nobody was injured, although both cars were badly damaged.

Solicitor David McKie, defending, said: 'To al intents and purposes she is an upstanding member of the community. She voluntarily runs salsa dancing classes in Dundee.

'What happened was a direct result of her family history, and circumstances relating to the emotional impact of attending her biological father's wedding. It was the emotional impact of that day of the wedding and the exclusion she felt.'
