Karl Lagerfeld is one of fashion's most famous faces and his designs are amongst the most coveted.

And while the couture creations for Chanel usually set fashionistas back thousands of pounds, now everyone can don the Chanel Kaiser's designs.

Karl has unveiled a quirky and cut-price new Tokidoki x Karl Lagerfeld collection on fashion e-tailer Net-a-porter.

The new capsule collection features printed jeans, casual vest tops and 
T-shirts, a scarf and an array of, slightly psychedelic, Karl-emblazoned garments such as leggings and clutch bags.

This is the 
German designer's second partnership with the brand, which was established by 
Italian artist Simone Legno.

The
range will also be 
available to buy at the Karl Lagerfeld concept stores in Berlin, 
Amsterdam and Paris.

Speaking about the new collection, Holli Rogers, Fashion Director at 
Net-a-Porter, told Grazia: 'We’re so excited to be partnering 
with Karl Lagerfeld as the exclusive online retailer for the Tokidoki x 
Karl Lagerfeld collection.

'These fun and playful pieces truly encompass the spirit 
of Karl. I adore Mr Choupette – guaranteed to make you smile!'

In celebration of the new range, the King of Chanel and his beloved pet 
cat Choupette have been immortalised in a statue.

Chanel's
creative director and his furry friend have been turned into a 
toy figurine as part of Japanese-inspired company tokidoki's latest 
capsule collection.

'I am very flattered that I have become a tokidoki,' 
Lagerfeld told Vogue.

'I always loved them and I am very happy to be one of them.'

This isn't the first time that the 79-year-old has been transformed into a doll.

Karl was once transformed into a knitted Mua Mua doll- an amazing set of fashion-inspired dolls hand knitted by young creatives in Bali looking for ways to raise University funds.

Karl Lagerfeld is set to create another short film about Coco Chanel and this time he has roped in Rupert Everett.

His film in May, which depicted the designer's first shop in Deauville to coincide with the brand's most recent cruise collection, starred long-time Chanel girl Keira Knightley.

And his latest offering will focus on Chanel in the fifties when it struck success in America following WWII, with Geraldine Chaplin, daughter of Charlie Chaplin replacing Knightley as Coco.

British actor Rupert Everett and a 'whole host' of other famous faces will also star in various roles, report WWD .

The film will celebrate the French fashion house's Métiers d'Art show in Dallas, Texas in December.
