Fatal: Champion bodyboarder David Lilienfeld was dragged under the water by the killer 16ft shark

A champion surfer was killed in a Great White shark shark attack in South Africa - as his brother paddled nearby.

David Lilienfeld, 20, was bodyboarding in the Indian Ocean when the 16ft beast struck, dragging him under the waves.

Terrified witnesses watched from the beach as the deadly predator grasped Mr Lilienfeld in his jaws, during the attack in the sea at Koeel Bay east of Cape Town.

His brother Gustav, who had been near his brother when the animal struck, helped drag him to rocks but he died before medics could reach him.

Devastated Gustav was consoled by his father at the scene moments after the tragedy yesterday.

And soon after the fatal attack, the spotlight fell on a documentary crew who were accused of risking public safety by luring sharks in close to the shore for filming.

NSRI spokesman Craig Lambinon confirmed Mr Lilienfeld's body was found 
on rocks on the shore and said his severed right leg had yet to be 
recovered.

He also confirmed that the surfer had been in the water alongside his brother, who witnessed the attack.

He said: 'The deceased man sustained complete amputation of his right 
leg, below the hip, while body boarding with his brother and friends and
 he was rescued from the water by his brother, friends and bystanders.

'The leg has not been recovered.'

He
 added: ‘The brother was in the sea at the time and apparently saw the 
incident unfold. We don't yet know exactly where the man was bitten, but
 he later washed up on some rocks.

‘He was examined at the scene by paramedics and is now being examined by pathologists.’

Mr Lambinon said the victim's brother had been offered counselling following the tragedy.

Victim: The body of David Lilienfeld, attacked by a shark at Gordon's Bay in South Africa, is carried away by police and a rescue team

Officials
 said in the moments before the attack witnesses had spotted a shark 
believed to be a Great White and thought to measure up to 16 feet in 
length.

The tragedy happened
 at the Koeel Bay beach, a popular surfing spot which lies close to the 
town of Gordon's Bay around 30 miles east of Cape Town.

Yesterday's
 attack comes after a TV documentary crew was accused of risking public 
safety by attracting sharks into shallow waters around Cape Town.

Experts this week expressed concern 
after it emerged a film crew shooting along the region's False Bay coastline were using chum and bait to lure sharks to their boats.

Cape Town based shark author Dirk 
Schmidt appealed last week to South Africa's department of the 
environment over its decision to grant permits for the controversial 
filming to take place.

He said today that he had feared bringing sharks closer to the shore would increase the risk of an attack.

He
 said: ‘I expressed my serious concerns about the project because I 
feared public safety could be put at risk if they were brought closer to
 the beaches for filming.

‘I
 went out earlier this week and watched the crew luring White sharks 
close to their boats and then fishing them out to tag them for the project.

‘Obviously when this kind of activity is happening there is always a risk of increased shark presence in the area afterwards.

‘It's impossible to say for sure whether the filming project is linked to today's terrible tragedy.

‘However
 this was my worst case scenario, and I wish the department of the 
environment had issued a strong warning to bathers while the filming was
 underway.’

Nothing they could do: Rescue workers prepare to transport the surfer's body. A documentary crew had been accused of trying to lure sharks to the shore to film

South Africa's government today confirmed a documentary had been cancelled in light of this morning's tragedy.

However, confusion surrounds who in fact had been filming in the area prior to the tragedy.

South African officials had said a team from National Geographic Channel's Shark Men were issued with a permit to film.

But the channel flatly denies filming in the area at the time and categorically stated it was 'not associated with this event'.

Department of the environment spokesman Zolile Nqayi yesterday said a crew had been informed their permits were being immediately withdrawn.

He said: ‘We have cancelled all the permits for the Shark Men filming and research project following the attack today.

‘There has been considerable controversy about this project which we have noted, however we have always believed that the project would not result in any increased risk to the public.

‘We do not believe that today's attack was linked to the Shark Man filming but have decided to stop this whole thing now to prevent panic among the public.’

But a spokesman for the National Geographic Channel said: 'National Geographic Channel are not filming and are not associated with this event.

'While it is true we do have a series currently airing on National Geographic Channel called “Shark Men” with Chris Fischer, we have not renewed the series for another season, have no plans to at the moment, and are not filming new episodes at this time. 

'Therefore, the filming we understand is taking place in South Africa is not for National Geographic Channel or for future episodes of Shark Men.

'National Geographic Channel shares our sincere condolences to the family of the surfer killed yesterday off the coast of South Africa.'
