A prisoner was mistakenly freed from an open prison because he had the same surname as an inmate who was due for release that day.

Anthony Douglas, who is in his 20s, strolled out of HMP Hewell in Worcestershire last Wednesday instead of another convict who had completed his sentence.

It is understood a senior member of staff was suspended after the mistake at the prison - where a killer managed to escape last year.

Officers managed to track down and arrest the convict the next day and he is now back in jail.

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'A prisoner from Hewell was released in error on July 2.

'The police were notified immediately and he was recaptured on July 3.

'An investigation by a senior governor has been launched.

'We take public protection extremely seriously and this type of incident is a very rare but regrettable occurrence.'

Douglas, who is originally from Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, is thought to have spent time at the high-security psychiatric unit Ashworth Hospital in Liverpool, where one-eyed killer Dale Cregan was admitted.

It is unclear how long Douglas had left on his sentence when he escaped or what he had been convicted of.

The embarrassing gaffe is the latest in a string of controversial incidents at the jail - which holds Category B, C and D inmates.

Under pressure: The mistake is the latest in a series of accidental prison breaks this year despite Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's vow to tighten the rules and increase security to prevent any more escapes

Scores of prisoners have wandered free thanks to blunders by prison staff this year.

In May, mental patient David Burslam, who was convicted of kidnapping, fled when he was taken for a stroll outside Cheswold Park Hospital in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

It came after the 'Scarborough Slasher' Damien Burns, 39, and convicted thief Dean Jackson, 27, fled Category D prison HMP Hatfield, also in Doncaster.

Their escape was just a fortnight after Michael 'Skull Cracker' Wheatley broke free from an open prison in Kent.

Murderer Arnold Pickering, 44, went on the run from Category C jail HMP Kennet in Merseyside in May but was later arrested for being unlawfully at large in Oldham.

Robber Thomas Moffett, 51, was also arrested after escaping on the same day.

Since 2010, 18 convicts have absconded, but the Prison Service continues to refuse to reveal their identities, suggesting it does not believe the information is of public interest.

In October last year, murderer Alan Giles who was serving two life sentences for kidnapping and killing a teenager went on the run from the prison.

The 56-year-old was jailed for the murder and kidnap of 16-year-old student Kevin Ricketts, who was killed in January 1995.

He had been allowed out on day release to work at a charity shop before absconding and was eventually recaptured after nine days on the run.

Giles was sentenced to a further six months in prison in January this year after admitting escaping from lawful custody.

And last month police re-arrested a man from Sandwell, West Midlands, who failed to return to the prison while on day release.

The 33-year-old was serving a four-year sentence for burglary when he went missing after being allowed to travel to West Bromwich, West Mids.

HMP Hewell was created in June 2008 in a merger of the three former prisons at the site - Blakenhurst, Brockhill and Hewell Grange.

The prison primarily serves the Worcestershire, West Midlands and Warwickshire areas.

Part of the establishment is an open prison but it was not believed Douglas was an inmate in that section.

Earlier this year Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced plans to tighten rules surrounding day release from open prisons after a series of controversies about AWOL prisoners.

New measures could include fitting electronic tags to prisoners on day release and more stringent risk assessment before day passes are approved.
