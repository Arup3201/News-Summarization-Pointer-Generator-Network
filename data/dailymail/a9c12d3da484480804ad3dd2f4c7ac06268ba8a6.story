A new Washington, D.C. abortion clinic will have a 'spa-like feel', with fluffy robes, natural wood floors and tea on arrival, in an attempt to help destigmatize the procedure.

Carafem, which opens this week, has a no-frills attitude when it comes to informing people with what they provide. One of their advertisement's reads, 'Abortion: Yeah, we do that'.

Christopher Purdy, the clinic's president and founder, said he was inspired to start Carafem after working more than a decade promoting family planning and HIV prevention in developing countries.

Carafem president and founder Christopher Purdy (pictured with health services vice president Melissa S. Grant) has begun a new Washington, D.C. abortion clinic that presents itself with a 'spa-like feel' 

It was there he realized how much easier it was to get an abortion, sometimes as simple as walking into a pharmacy, in places such as Ethiopia.  

Meanwhile, in the United States more than 200 laws have restricted the controversial procedure and forced dozens of clinics to close their doors, according to the Washington Post. 

Melissa S. Grant, Carafem's health services vice president, said  it was important for the clinic 'to try and present an upgrade, almost spa-like feel'.

The clinic will also only provide pharmaceutical abortions, meaning there will be no vacuum aspiration or surgical procedures available - this means that Carafem's clients cannot be more than 10 weeks pregnant. 

Purdy told the Washington Post that not purchasing surgical equipment allows him to charge $400 for the procedure, which is about $100 less than the average pharmaceutical abortion.

Clients who walk into Carafem will receive counseling and go through 'basic tests' before they take the initial pill at the clinic. 

The whole appointment is supposed to take about 60 minutes.

The second set of pills, which induces the abortion, is then taken at home the next day. 

On it's website, Carafem says it's staff provides 'clear, non-judgmental and accurate information so you feel confident'. 

'We are an experienced team with years of experience in abortion care,' it states. 

Purdy said the clinic plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically.

'We don't walk to talk in hushed tones,' he said. 

'We use the A-word.' 

Anti-abortion activists don't believe Carafem's bold take is going to work. 

Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of anti-abortion lobbying group the Susan B. Anthony List, believes the approach is too celebratory. 

She said she believes even people who are pro-choice think of the procedure as 'a necessary evil'. 

National Right to Life President Carol Tobias believes people will find Carafem disgusting. 

'Abortion is not pleasant, and trying to put pretty wrappings around the procedure isn't going to make any difference,' she said.  

Purdy said the clinic, which he described as 'fresh, modern, clean and caring', plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically. 'We don't walk to talk in hushed tones,' he said. 'We use the A-word'

Carafem's founders aren't the only people speaking publicly and positively about abortion. 

A number of female Democratic lawmakers have shared their personal experiences to put a human face on the procedure and protest anti-abortion legislation.

Last week Ohio Democrat Rep. Teresa Fedor revealed during a debate in the House that she had terminated a pregnancy after being raped while serving in the military and became pregnant.

'You don't respect my reason, my rape, my abortion,' she said as representatives debated the state's Heartbeat Bill, which would make it a felony for doctors to provide abortions if a fetal heartbeat is detected.

'I guarantee you there are other woman who should stand up with me and be courageous enough to speak that voice,' she continued. 'I've sat here long enough.'
