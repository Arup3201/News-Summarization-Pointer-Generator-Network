It is just a coincidence that Aston Villa-crested gilets in the official merchandise shop by the club’s grand stadium are on offer, reduced from £42 to £29. A happy coincidence, though.

The knockdown price was implemented as winter took hold, before Tim Sherwood rolled into town. They have been selling well.

The rail, bare on Sunday evening, has been replenished with the final six in stock – four small sizes and two extra-large. It is unclear whether Sherwood’s arrival had a similar uplift to gilet sales as it did the team’s performance after half-time against Leicester City.

Former Tottenham manager Sherwood was unveiled as Aston Villa manager on Monday

Whatever, should he request the garment he made somewhat famous over five months in charge at Tottenham Hotspur, he may have to wait a little.

He walked into the press conference room in the Trinity Road Stand wearing a suit, v-neck jumper, and the confidence needed in such a precarious situation.

A mention was immediately made of that missing bit of warm clothing. Sherwood puffed his cheeks. ‘F****** hell, I thought it would be two seconds before I heard a gilet joke,’ he said. ‘It was one!’

More is needed than a well-timed comic quip in Villa’s current plight of course, but Sherwood’s words brought a breath of fresh air to a place that has developed a stale odour.

He was alert and direct, never far from allowing a drop of humour to enter proceedings. ‘Honest’, was a word uttered more than once.

That is what his new players can expect. Straight-talking criticism aimed at provoking an immediate upturn in performances and also education for lasting improvement.

Noble aims to speak of, harder to implement in practice. Listening to Sherwood for nearly an hour, though, it is clear Villa have acted correctly in jettisoning Paul Lambert and bringing in the former Spurs head coach.

Whether he does indeed keep Villa safe from relegation remains to be seen. A change was undoubtedly required.

Sherwood was clear that he needs to provide a short, sharp shock straight away to keep Villa up. Beyond that point, he wants to work with young talents – as long as the club academy has them – and bring more through to the first-team.

Of the here and now, Sherwood said: ‘I’ve got a way I like to work, it has been a success albeit a short period. I know how to win games in this league. I know how to galvanise players, get the best out of them, that is what I will do here.’

Sherwood remains the Spurs manager with the best Premier League win ratio (59 per cent) but still some question his appointment on terms of experience.

He had a decent answer here too. ‘There are a lot of poor experienced managers,’ he said plainly. ‘A lot of good ones too. I think it’s overrated to be honest.’ There was that word again.

Sherwood adopted the claret and blue scarf for his promotional shots in the stands at Villa Park, beneath a cloudy sky that seemed apt for the club’s predicament.

At the same time a scattering of customers perused the shop across the road, searching for value. If Sherwood manages to keep Villa in the Premier League, he will be viewed as the best bargain of the year.
