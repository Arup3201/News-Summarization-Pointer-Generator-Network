While most actresses dread their fourth decade, Cameron Diaz had an incredible reaction to turning 40.

'I was so excited,' she told Oprah in an interview with OWN on Sunday night, she added: 'The actress says she woke up on her birthday and thought, "Oh, now life begins. Oh, this is it! This is the coolest thing ever."'

She explained how she embraced the ageing process, telling Oprah, 60: 'It's a gradual thing and you get to learn about yourself and see yourself and start to live with who you are as you go.'

'We're expected to defy nature': Cameron Diaz has opened up about her battle to age naturally in an Oprah interview

It would've been so easy for Cameron 
to go the way of other stunning movie stars; under the knife, straight 
to the nearest filler specialist and heavy on the Botox.

But
 after a brush with Hollywood's favourite face freezer left the 
Something About Mary feeling disengaged with her own face; the blonde 
beauty - still one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood - made the
 tough decision to allow herself to age naturally.

And on Sunday, Cameron  - who landed a $40M paycheck for 2011's Bad Teacher, which is way above the standard for leading ladies and twice what a male contemporary like Leo DiCaprio can command - opened up to Oprah Winfrey about taking a stand against ageism in society.

She said that it is ‘crazy’ how women are under pressure to look like they are 25 even when they are more mature.

She said that women ‘don’t give 
ourselves permission to age gracefully’ and that they are constantly 
told they have to ‘defy nature’.

Diaz herself has in the past fallen victim to the guilt she describes and has had Botox which she regrets as it changed her face in a ‘weird way’.

She had a nose job after breaking it four times and has spoken about her battle with acne, revealing that she tried everything from makeup to medication to make it go away.

Diaz said: ‘For me I feel like if I - it is almost as if we have failed if we don't remain 25 for the rest of our lives.

‘Like we are failures. It is a personal failure. Like our fault that at 40 years old that I still don't look like I'm 25.’

Arguably, it;s Cameron's determination to grow into her own face that's ensured she's stayed at the top of the Hollywood casting tree, certainly her lucrative Bad Teacher role relied on her ability to mug it up in a way the Botox queens just can't.

Her latest role, as Miss Hannigan in the remake of Annie alongside Jamie Foxx and with Quvenzhané Wallis as the titular star, involves similar comedy.

Feigning indignation, she said: ‘Oh, I'm sorry. I apologise, I wasn't able to defy nature.’

Diaz agreed with Winfrey that everyone's trying to be ‘back there,’ in the past.

She said: ‘Women don't allow other women to age gracefully, and we don't give ourselves permission to age gracefully, everybody’s judging.’ 

Cameron, pictured aged 26 in her breakthrough role in There's Something About Mary, spoke about how women feel they have somehow failed if they don't look like they are in their 20s

Diaz, who has just released her lifestyle guide The Body Book, gave the interview weeks after Sharon Stone spoke out about how she ‘wanted to die’ when she put on weight in her 20s.

The Basic Instinct star, 55, said that she cried uncontrollably after being taunted by men who wolf whistled at her curves and larger breasts.

In a frank interview she also said that years later she suffered a relapse and teared up in the  bathroom with a bottle of wine as she told herself: ‘I’m not coming out until I can totally accept the way I look.’

Now and then: Cameron said on Monday she stopped using Botox, which may be why she looked so smooth back in May (right) last year
