More than 20 MPs earned over £100,000 in second jobs last year – topping up their £67,060 House of Commons salary.

Overall, MPs picked up some £7.1million in outside earnings – an average of more than £10,000 each – according to Parliamentary records.

Some 26 MPs earned more outside Parliament than they did as an MP, the latest register of members’ interests reveals.

The top earner – according to research carried out by the Guardian – is former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who declared £492,331 in outside earnings, mainly for public speaking.

Mr Brown does not receive any of the cash himself – but instead has all the money paid to the Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown to run his charity.

The biggest earner other than Mr Brown is the Tory MP Geoffrey Cox, who took home £368,322 as a barrister outside of the Commons.

Fellow barristers Stephen Phillips and Sir Edward Garnier – who both make the top 10 best paid politicians – also earn in excess of £200,000.

Mr Garnier said working outside Parliament was good for democracy. He said: ‘The two-jobs stab is a bit lame and unoriginal.

‘Parliament is the better for having MPs who do not spend and have not spent their whole time inside politics.’

Gordon Brown was the best paid MP in outside earnings, but has the cash paid to the Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown and does not benefit personally

Conservative Nadine Dorries earned £167,140 – mainly from her best-selling novel The Four Streets.

She told the Guardian: ‘My outside earnings are mainly as a result of my writing, which I began when my youngest daughter left home for university and I found myself no longer required as a cook, chauffeur and laundress at the weekends,’ she said.

‘I find it really interesting that no one ever queried the time I gave to being a mother and an MP. I am however absolutely delighted that my writing, which is in effect my weekend hobby, is so lucrative and I urge anyone who has ever considered writing to not wait as long as I did and to give it a go.’

The Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, who declared £187,000 of income, mainly from an IT company he founded before becoming an MP, said he was good value because he paid ‘more in taxes than my net parliamentary salary’.

Hard-left Respect MP George Galloway was last year’s third highest-earning MP. The socialist firebrand picked up £265,350 – mainly speaking

Mr Galloway earned £265,350 – almost four times his parliamentary salary – in outside earnings, primarily from paid weekly appearances for the Iranian state-owned broadcaster Press TV, for which Galloway received £100,650, and a further £96,000 – not including air fares – for fortnightly broadcasts from Beirut for Al Mayadeen.

A spokesman for Mr Galloway defended his TV appearances. He said: ‘His programmes enable him to reach a far greater audience than would otherwise be the case for his views, both domestically and internationally. No one from these TV stations determines editorial content.’

Other top earners included Tory Charles Hendry, who was until September 2012 an Energy Minister.

Mr Hendry – who is leaving Parliament next year – said he received an income of £100,000 from three companies working in the energy sector: Forewind, an offshore wind group, Atlantic Superconnection, a proposal to bring energy into the UK from Iceland, and the energy and commodities group Vitol.

Andrew Mitchell, whose was forced to resign as chief whip following the fallout over the Plebgate row, is another former minister with substantial private sector earnings. Mr Mitchell declared £103,000 in earnings.

There is no suggestion that any of the MPs has broken Parliamentary rules governing outside earnings.

But anti-lobbying pressure groups said the amounts of money being earned by MPs raised concerns shifted ‘loyalty and attention away from the public interest to representing the narrow private interests of their other employer’.

Tamasin Cave of the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency told the Guardian: ‘As their paymasters, the public has the right to know far more about MPs’ jobs on the side. What, for example, is a property developer that pays an MP £10,000 a year getting for its money?

‘It’s also valid to question whether the promise of future employment is having an influence on ministerial decisions, as well as what advantages they are bringing to the private sector, like their insider knowledge of how government works.’
