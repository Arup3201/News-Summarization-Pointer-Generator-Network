Five teenage girls who showed 'an interest' in travelling to Syria have been barred by a High Court judge from travelling abroad.

Mr Justice Hayden today made the two 15-year-olds and three 16-year-olds wards of court - a move which prevents them from leaving the jurisdiction of England and Wales.

He made the ruling at a hearing at the High Court after Tower Hamlets local authority raised concerns.

The five girls were made wards of court, which prevents them from leaving the UK. Mr Justice Hayden made the ruling today at the High Court (pictured) after hearing the girls had 'shown an interest' in travelling to Syria

The judge, who directed that the girls could not be identified although it is believed all five are from Tower Hamlets in East London, also made orders removing their passports and those of a number of adults involved in their care. 

He said the ban was a  'draconian' step, as was the removal of the passport.

Mr Justice Hayden told the hearing: 'But the risk contemplated here is as grave as it can be for it is common knowledge that so many have lost their lives in Syria and so many have gone knowing that would be likely.

'As I said early this week in another case, and I repeat it in this, sometimes the law has to intervene to protect these young people, ultimately from themselves.

The judge said the ban was a 'draconian' step, but necessary to protect the girls. Pictured: Aleppo, Syria

'Therefore I am satisfied there is evidence of sufficient cogency and the evaluation of risk is such as to justify the orders sought.'

The girls and adults concerned, who were not in court today, can challenge the emergency ruling at a future date if they wish.

The judge added he made the order to include the adults because of evidence that in at least one other case young girls had travelled on passports belonging to members of their family.

He also said there was evidence suggesting that the family members in the case had not been full and frank with social services, and that the girls had been moving to a more radicalised position.

'It seems to me that that must have been known to the parents and they deliberately did not share it with the authorities who were keen to protect these vulnerable young girls.' 

Authorities are making increasingly strenuous efforts to stop young British people - including teenagers as young as 15 - trying to reach areas of Syria controlled by Islamic State militants.

The ruling comes just three days after the judge banned a 16-year-old boy from Brighton from travelling abroad after his two elder brothers were killed fighting jihad in Syria.

The teenager, who cannot be named, was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London on Tuesday. 

The judge made the ruling after social services at Brighton and Hove City Council raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers' footsteps and travel to the war-torn region.

Barrister Martin Downs, representing the council, told the court that three of his brothers had gone to fight for the al-Nusra Front - a group with links to al-Qaeda.

Two had died in their teens and the third had been wounded but was still fighting in Syria. A friend of the teenager had also been killed in fighting.

Mr Downs added that his family had an 'extraordinary history' and he also had an uncle who had been held in United States' detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The ruling prevents the teenager, who has dual Libyan and British citizenship, from leaving England and Wales.

In February Sharmeena Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, all fled to Syria.

All four schoolgirls attended Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets.

Sharmeena is now living in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, in Syria, as a jihadi bride and told her father she will never come home.
