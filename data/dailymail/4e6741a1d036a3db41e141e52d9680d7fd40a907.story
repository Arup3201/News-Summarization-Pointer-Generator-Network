A 38-year-old man killed in an execution style shooting in Melbourne knew he was in danger in the week leading up to his murder, neighbours say.

The father of three was shot at point-blank range in the chest at around 11pm on Saturday as he was at the house with other business associates.

The man, whose first name is Adrian and who is believed to be of Maltese origin, installed security cameras in the home he shared in the northern Melbourne suburb of Epping where his wife and three young children lived nine days before the shooting.

Death threats: the 38-year-old man shot dead at point blank range at the home he shared with his young family in Melbourne had hidden inside the house earlier in the day when a knocked banged on his door brandishing a piece of wood and issuing death threats

Just hours before the shooting, he hid inside the house with others as a man banged on his door with a piece of wood threatening to kill him

'I saw a man holding a bat or plank of wood, screaming "someone is going to die",' one neighbour told the Herald Sun.

Another told the MailOnline the man was calling out the man's name. 'Obviously Adrian didn't come out and he didn't ring police,' the neighbour said.

'I believe he was expecting trouble. He'd been living in the neighbourhood with his wife and kids for so long and then suddenly he put in CCTV.'

Following the threats, the man called friends or associates over to the house where they remained until the shooting.

Six shots were fired into a vehicle and the house from at least two different firearms.

Neighbour Debbie Tuckerman, who is a registered nurse, said after the second shot rang out she phoned police who arrived within seven minutes.

'It was quite scary,' Mrs Tuckerman said, 'there were these guys pleading for help, saying 'we don't know what to do, please help", but I didn't know whether the shooter was still around.'

Mrs Tuckerman waited until she saw the first police car arrived and a woman police officer step out.

'I told her, "I'm a nurse" and I went in.' She ran to the home to find the man lying in a pool of blood and his wife beside him.

'She was screaming, "he is going to die",' Ms Tuckerman said.

'Adrian had bullet wounds to the right of his chest and there was a lot of blood. I applied CPR, but I couldn't find a pulse.'

Police found a second man with non-life threatening leg injuries. It is believed five men fled on foot after the shooting.

Neighbours described the house as very busy, with a lot of 'comings and goings'.
