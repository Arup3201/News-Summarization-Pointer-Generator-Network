West Ham are looking to sign Paris Saint-Germain midfield prospect Fode Toure Ballo for the summer.

The 18-year-old has been recommended to West Ham by scouts after string of impressive performances for PSG's reserves and their U19 UEFA Youth League sides.

West Ham tried to strike a deal last month for his 17-year-old teammate, striker Jean-Kevin Augustin and remain in the hunt, as do Arsenal. 

Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Fode Toure Ballo is attracting interest from clubs including West Ham

Sam Allardyce and his West Ham staff have joined the race to sign the PSG youngster in the summer

However, they are making a push now for Ballo as other clubs are also keen on the left-sided midfielder who is equally adept at left-back.

Ballo is still on amateur forms and is a France youth international. He has played 12 games for PSG's second string this season.

West Ham now hope to persuade the youngster to move to London in the summer.
