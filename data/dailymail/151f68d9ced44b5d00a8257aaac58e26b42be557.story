Marta Guskiewicz leaves Skipton Magistrates court after being sentenced for stalking a soldier and sending him pictures of her bottom

A blonde barmaid who became obsessed with a soldier posed as his ex wife and sent him a photo of her naked bottom to 'make him happy'.

Marta Guskiewicz, 29, bombarded Craig Outhwaite with phone calls, text messages and visits to his house. She also changed her surname to his on Facebook to pose as his ex-wife.

Polish immigrant Marta, of Skipton, West Yorkshire, also posted a copy of lads' magazine Nuts, together with a £5 note and a message reading 'I love you. I want to have your babies.'

Mr Outhwaite's girlfriend Hollie Waddington was also targeted by Guskiewicz who allegedly created a Facebook page with Miss 
Waddington's photo on and advertised 'prostitutes, all you want, 
anything £20, dirty ugly skanks'.

Skipton
 Magistrates' Court heard Marta met Mr Outhwaite, a moorland surveyor 
and Army reservist, when she worked as a barmaid at a pub in 
Horton-in-Ribblesdale, but they never had a relationship.

Prosecutor
 Caroline Midgley said Mr Outhwaite was posted to Afghanistan in October
 2012 and used Facebook to communicate with friends - one of whom was 
Marta.

On his return from active service Marta bombarded Mr Outhwaite with texts and phone calls until he blocked her number.

Mrs Midgley said she then left messages on his Facebook page asking about his Army medals.

'Mr Outhwaite was at home with his girlfriend when Miss Guskiewicz turned up on his doorstep," said Mrs Midgley.

'He was angry and told her to go. He was not polite to her and told her to leave him alone and her advances where not welcome...though not quite in those words,'

Between August 22 and August 28 2013 Marta left 21 voicemail messages with Mr Outhwaite, who reported her to the police because he felt harassed and distressed.

She was served with a Harassment Act Warning on September 4 but she continued to stalk him.

Mrs Midgley said: 'On Christmas Day 2013 he received a Facebook image of her semi-clothed and showing her bottom to the camera.'

On 12 September Miss Waddington, a receptionist at a Yorkshire Dales veterinary practice, collected her boyfriend from Catterick Garrison and told him the stalker had changed her Facebook page, and was now calling herself Marta Outhwaite, had his mobile number on the page and had falsely posted that he was involved with prostitutes and drugs.

Guskiewicz also allegedly wrote that 'Dirty, skanky bitches' live at his house.

When she was arrested she admitted to loving Mr Outhwaite.

Mrs Midgley said: 'She admitted sending the picture of her bottom on Christmas Day and said she sent it to make him happy.'

JPs at Skipton Magistrates Court (pictured) sentenced Marta to a 12 month community order and banned her from going within 500m of Craig Outhwaite's home

She also admitted posting Nuts magazine together with the message and cash.

Guskiewicz pleaded guilty to stalking Mr Outhwaite between 1 May 2013 and 13 January 2014.

Jill Darrington, defending, said: 'She realises now that it was wrong.'

The court heard Guskiewicz, who is now working as a shop worker in Leeds, had suffered trauma in 2007 when her then boyfriend died.

JPs sentenced Guskiewicz to a 12 month community order, with supervision from a probation officer and ordered her to complete 40 hours' unpaid work.

She was ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

She is also banned from contacting Mr Outhwaite or going within 500 metres of his house.
