A runaway tractor ploughed into the back of a family home - feet from where a 16-year-old girl was stood.

Bexi Hebbourn was seconds away from being hit when the farmer's tractor careered through the back wall as she took washing to an outhouse.

It brought down tonnes of masonry and brickwork at the exact spot the teenager was about to enter.

Bexi Hebbourn said she was seconds away from being hit by a tractor that ploughed into the back of her house

The tractor caused £25,000 worth of damage when it smashed into the back wall feet away from Bexi

Bexi said she would have been struck by the mound of rubble if she had gone to put the washing out 10 seconds later.

The accident caused £25,000 damage to the house in Ulverston, Cumbria.

The GCSE student, said: 'I was walking down to the tumble dryer to put some clothes in with a basket in my hand and a couple of moments later something hit the wall and then the door of the wall came flying off and nearly hit our dogs, Rusty and Beatrix.

'There was a big tractor wheel poking out. If I had set off to put the washing in 10 seconds later, I would have been standing there.'

Bexi said she only realised how close her escape was after the impact.

The collision threw tonnes of rubble at the place where she would have been standing for the tumble dryer.

Bexi
said that bricks 'the height of her rib-cage' surrounded the dryer, which had its door ripped off.

The top of a nearby chest 
freezer was ripped from its hinges and a family bike destroyed.

She said: 'My first reaction wasn't shock or surprise - it just seemed to happen like it was a cartoon.

'It was only when I saw the damage, and the rubble that would have been piled up to my ribs, that I realised. I felt very lucky and shocked.'

Neighbours described the moment of impact as like 'an earthquake'.

The accident happened on Old Hall Road in Ulverston on a route often used by farm workers to head to and from the town.

The driver of the vehicle - a farm worker - was not injured in the incident on June 8.

Cumbria Police are now investigating and have met with Mrs Hebbourn and Bexi, who has just finished her GCSEs at Ulverston Victoria High School.

The formal cause of the accident has not yet been determined but police said they are treating it as an accident.

No one has been arrested.

Bexi's mum Kay, 49, a self-employed businesswoman, is now looking into what traffic calming measures could be installed on the lane, which is regularly used by farm traffic.

She said: 'It makes me realise that everything can be replaced but had anything happened to Bexi it would be so horrendous.

'Fortunately she is ok. The police have said there have been five incidents all on the same stretch of road.'
