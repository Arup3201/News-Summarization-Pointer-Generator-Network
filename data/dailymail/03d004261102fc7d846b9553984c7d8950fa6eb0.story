A grandmother was barred from boarding a flight to Florida so she could see her family at Easter because of her oxygen tank.

When Jane Graham-Bailey arrived at Asheville airport in North Carolina airline staff told her because she didn't have a doctor's note for her tank she would be unable to fly.

The 78-year-old, who has asthma, says she was not asked for paperwork for the tank when she flew to Asheville earlier in the year, but on her return Allegiant Air said she was unable to fly.

Trapped: Jane Graham-Bailey has been forced to stay in North Carolina for another week after an airline refused to let her take an oxygen tank on a plane

The grandmother had been trying to return home from extended visit with her daughter-in-law over the holiday weekend.

Doctor's note: Jane Graham-Bailey has asthma but didn't know she needed a medical pass for her tank

Instead, she has been forced to stay in North Carolina while the paperwork arrives.

Ms Graham-Bailey told the Ashville Citizen-Times: 'I didn’t deserve this. I deserved to sit down with my family and enjoy Easter dinner.

'I’m 78. I don’t have that many Easters left. I feel like [the airline] took something away from me and my family.'

Jessica Wheeler, a spokeswoman for the airline, said Ms Graham-Bailey was not allowed to board the flight because she needed a physician consent form for the oxygen tank.

She added that the airline's regulations were based on those set by the FAA.

'Oxygen tanks are highly flammable. We need to ensure, for everyone’s safety, that an oxygen tank has been recently inspected and that it is medically safe for the passenger to fly,' she said.

Ms Graham-Bailey had offered to leave the tank behind but the airline rejected that offer over concerns that she may need the oxygen on the flight.

She said she didn't fly often and was not aware that she needed paperwork to take an oxygen tank on a flight.

The airline agreed to refund the cost of her ticket but, because Ms Graham-Bailey's son can only collect her from the airport on Sundays, she has had to wait a week before flying home.

He explained that his mother's health had deteriorated in the 
past two years and she was recently hospitalized with COPD (chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma. 

Doctors
 told her she would need to be on increasing amounts of medication, and 
the bill for her care had caused Ms Graham-Bailey to fall into debt.

Stuck: Jane Graham-Bailey was trying to fly from Asheville airport in North Carolina to her home in Florida

In October last year, Ms Graham-Bailey's 
family set up a Go Fund Me page to help her repay some of the debt 
caused by her medical expenses.

She is 'one of the most intelligent, fun, caring people I have ever known,' her son, Jay McCampbell, said, adding that she had been suffering with the worry at the cost of her medical bills.

With the economy faltering, and two adult children in college, he was unable to fully pay her bills himself so reached out to the wider community.

As her health improved a little, the grandmother had traveled to North Carolina to visit relatives but, after the confrontation at the airport, Ms Graham-Bailey says she will catch a flight from Tennessee when she finally goes home.
