Former boxing champion Hector 'Macho' Camacho will be taken off life support on Saturday, his family announced tonight.

His mother, Maria Matias, told reporters on Friday evening that he would be removed from artificial respiration once three of his sons had had a chance to say goodbye, adding: 'I lost my son three days ago.'

But Camacho's eldest son, Hector Jr, opposed the decision to end his father's life and said: 'He's going to fight until the end. My father is a boxer.'

Doctors in San Juan have said the boxer is
clinically brain dead after being shot earlier this week in his hometown
of Bayamon.

Ms Matias announced outside the 
hospital in San Juan where Camacho has been kept alive for three days 
that she had decided it was time to remove him from life support, 
saying: 'I lost my son three days ago. He's alive only because of a 
machine.'

She added: 'My son is not alive. My son is only alive for the people who love him.'

The boxer's three other sons were 
expected to arrive in Puerto Rico late on Friday night. 'Until they 
arrive, we will not disconnect the machine,' Ms Matias said.

Although the former champion's mother
has the final say in the matter, Hector Jr made it clear that he 
thought his father should be kept alive for as long as possible.

Before the decision was made, he said: 'My father is a boxer and we're going
to let him fight for his life. The doctors have said a lot 
of things, but he is alive, he's in the fight.'

Two of Camacho's sisters had asked that he remain on life support until Saturday.

'It is a very difficult decision, a 
very delicate decision,' said former pro-boxer Victor 'Luvi' Callejas, a
longtime friend, in a phone interview.

'The last thing we lose is hope and faith. If there is still hope and faith, why not wait a little more?'

Aida Camacho, one of the boxer's aunts, said the family could decide by late Friday whether to donate his organs.

'I'm a person of a lot of faith, and I believe in miracles, but science has spoken,' she said.

Another
aunt, Blanca Camacho, also said the family had agreed to the wishes of 
the two sisters from New York to hold off on ending life support at the 
Puerto Rico hospital.

She added: 'There's nothing left here. He's already dead.'

As some relatives and friends continued to pray for a miracle, condolences kept coming in for the boxer's family and preparations have begun for memorials and a funeral Mass.

Bearer of bad news: Dr Ernesto Torres, director of the Centro Medico trauma center in San Juan, declared that the boxing legend was clinically brain dead

Governor Luis Fortuno said he lamented what he called a sudden loss.

'''Macho'' will always be remembered for his spontaneity and charisma in and out of the ring,' he said.

Also offering condolences was governor-elect Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who defeated Fortuno in November.

'The
life of Macho Camacho, like other great athletes of ours, united the 
country,' he said. 'We celebrated his triumphs in the streets and we 
applauded him with noble sportsmanship when he didn't prevail.'

'We have done everything we could,' 
said Dr Ernesto Torres, who is the director of the Centro Medico trauma 
center in San Juan.Â 

'We have to tell the people of Puerto Rico and the entire world that Macho Camacho has died, he is brain dead.'

Dr Torres
said Camacho's father had indicated that he wanted the boxer 
taken off life support and his organs donated, but one of his sisters 
had opposed the idea.

'This is a very difficult moment,' the doctor added.

Fighter: Camacho's condition worsened overnight at the critical care unit in San Juan

The champ's funeral is expected to be held in Puerto Rico, where the legendary boxer was born, or in New York City where he grew up.

Doctors initially had said Camacho was in critical, but stable 
condition and expected to survive after he was shot. But his condition worsened on Wednesday and his heart 
stopped at one point.

The 50-year-old Camacho was shot as he and a friend sat in a Ford 
Mustang parked outside a bar.

Police spokesman Alex Diaz said officers 
found nine small bags of cocaine in the friend's pocket, and a 10th bag 
open inside the car.

Camacho's friend, identified as 49-year-old Adrian Mojica Moreno, was
killed in the attack. Police said two assailants fled in an SUV but no 
arrests have been made and no motive has been disclosed.

Camacho was rushed to Centro Medico, where doctors initially said the
bullet passed through his jaw and lodged in his shoulder.

Torres said 
the bullet damaged three of the four main arteries in his neck and 
fractured two vertebrae, which could leave him paralyzed if he were to 
survive.

Steve Tannenbaum, who has represented Camacho in the past, had 
been told earlier by friends at the hospital that the boxer would make 
it.

'This guy is a cat with nine lives. He's been through so much,' he said. 'If anybody can pull through it will be him.'

Friends and family members waited anxiously at the hospital, fondly 
recalling Camacho's high-energy personality and his powerful skills in 
the ring.

'He was like a little brother who was always getting into trouble,' said
former featherweight champion Juan Laporte, a fellow Puerto Rican who 
grew up and trained with Camacho in New York.

Camacho has been considered one of the more controversial figures in 
boxing, but also popular among fans and those who worked in the sport.

'The Macho Man was a promoter's dream,' renowned promoter Don King told 
AP. 'He excited boxing fans around the world with his inimitable style. 
He was a nice, amiable guy away from the ring.'

King had promoted Camacho but was caught off guard by news of the attack
on the former champion. 'What a tragedy this is,' he said. 'I'm very 
sorry for Hector and his family. My prayers go out to him.'

The fighter's last title bout came against then-welterweight champion 
Oscar De La Hoya in 1997, a loss by unanimous decision. He last fought 
in May 2010, losing to Saul Duran. Tannenbaum said they were looking at a
possible bout in 2013.

'We were talking comeback even though he is 50,' he said. 'I felt he was capable of it.'

Camacho was born in Bayamon, one of the cities that make up the San Juan metropolitan area.

He left Puerto Rico as a child and grew up mostly in New York's Harlem 
neighborhood, one of the reasons he later earned the nickname 'the 
Harlem Heckler.'

He went on to win super lightweight, lightweight and junior welterweight world titles in the 1980s.

Retired: Camacho's last title bout came against then-welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya in 1997, a loss by unanimous decision

Camacho has fought other high-profile bouts in his career against Felix 
Trinidad, Julio Cesar Chavez and Sugar Ray Leonard. Camacho knocked out 
Leonard in 1997, ending what was that former champ's final comeback 
attempt.

Camacho has a career record of 79-6-3.

In recent years, he has divided his time between Puerto Rico and 
Florida, appearing regularly on Spanish-language television as well as 
on a reality show called 'Es Macho Time!' on YouTube.

In San Juan, he 
had been living in the beach community of Isla Verde, where he would 
obligingly pose for photos with tourists who recognized him on the 
street, said former pro boxer Victor 'Luvi' Callejas, a neighbor and 
friend.

'We all know what Macho Camacho has done, but in the last couple of 
months he hasn't been in any trouble,' Callejas said as he kept vigil 
outside the hospital. 'He has been taking it easy. He's been upbeat.'

Drug, alcohol and other problems have trailed Camacho since the prime of
his boxing career. He was sentenced in 2007 to seven years in prison 
for the burglary of a computer store in Mississippi. While arresting him
on the burglary charge in January 2005, police also found the drug 
ecstasy.

A judge eventually suspended all but one year of the sentence and gave 
Camacho probation. He wound up serving two weeks in jail, though, after 
violating that probation.

His wife also filed domestic abuse complaints against him twice before their divorce several years ago.
