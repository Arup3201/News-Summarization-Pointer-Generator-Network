A new drug which boosts the immune system could provide a breakthrough in the treatment of obesity and related illnesses

A new drug which boosts the body's immune system could provide a breakthrough in the treatment of illnesses linked to obesity.

Spiraling obesity rates have resulted in alarming rates of diabetes, heart disease and cancer.

Scientists are hopeful that in the next two years a new jab could be available to tackle obesity -  and in turn slash the associated health risks.

A new study carried out at Havard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in the U.S. has identified a new hormone, irisin, which increases in the body during exercise, boosting energy and controlling blood glucose levels.

Researcher Professor Bruce Spiegelman said activating the body's immune system could treat obesity and diabetes.

He told the Express: 'This research reveals an exciting new class of potential treatments that could be used for obesity-related disorders.'

The body produces 'healthy' brown fat, which is turned on or activated when a person is cold to help maintain body heat by burning stored calories.

Studies have found exercise can stimulate hormones that activate brown fat.

The new research focused on a protein found to stimulate the secretion of the hormone irisin.

Prof Spiegelman said harnessing irisin could help scientists develop better therapies for any illness that can be controlled by exercise.

The breakthrough marks an important first step in understanding the biological mechanisms that translate physical exercise into beneficial changes throughout the body, both in healthy people and in preventing or treating disease.

Experiments found irisin helps convert 'bad' white fat - which accumulates around a person's middle - into 'healthy' brown fat, which increases energy expenditure and improves resistance to obesity linked diabetes.

Prof Spiegelman said: 'There has been a feeling in the field that exercise ‘talks to’ various tissues in the body. But the question has been, how?'

The report said the irisin hormone has direct and 'powerful effects' on adipose or fatty tissue - deposits of white fat that store excess calories, which contribute to obesity.

When irisin levels rise during exercise - or when injected directly into mice - it switches on genes that convert white fat into brown fat.

In the wake of findings by Prof Spiegelman and others, there has been a surge of interest in the therapeutic possibilities of increasing brown fat in adults.

Along with stimulating brown fat development, irisin was shown to improve glucose tolerance, a key measure of metabolic health, in mice fed a high fat diet.

Prof Spiegelman warned the discovery will not allow people to skip the gym and build muscles by taking irisin supplements, because the hormone does not appear to make muscles stronger.

The study showed irisin levels increase as a result of repeated bouts of prolonged exercise, but not during short-term muscle activity.

Scientists from Havard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute say a new hormone identified during their study could prove the breakthrough in the treatment of conditions including diabetes

To test whether increasing irisin alone could mimic exercise benefits, the scientists injected modest amounts into sedentary mice that were obese and pre-diabetic.

With just 10 days of treatment, the mice had better control of blood sugar and insulin levels - in effect, preventing the onset of diabetes - and lost a small amount of weight.

Although the weight loss was small, Prof Spiegelman said the hormone may have a greater effect when given for longer periods.

Prof Spiegelman said: 'Whether longer treatments with irisin and/or higher doses would cause more weight loss remains to be determined.

'The worldwide, explosive increase in obesity and diabetes renders attractive the therapeutic potential of irisin in these and related disorders.'

He added: 'Another potentially important aspect of this work relates to other beneficial effects of exercise, especially in some diseases for which no effective treatments exist.

'The clinical data linking exercise with health benefits in many other diseases suggests that irisin could also have significant effects in these disorders.'

His colleague Dr Pontus Bostrom said: 'It is s exciting to find a natural substance connected to exercise that has such clear therapeutic potential.'

Prof Spiegelman said it should be possible to move an irisin-based drug rapidly into clinical testing, possibly within two years, because it is a natural substance that is identical in mice and humans
