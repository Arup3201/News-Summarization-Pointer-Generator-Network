Tuesday saw the unveiling of the latest in technological must-haves: the Apple Watch, a gadget targeted at the style conscious as well as the tech-savvy. 

Wearable tech is one of the biggest buzz terms in the fashion industry right now as firms rush to invest in reserach and developement that will keep them ahead of the curve.

Early adopters of the techy trend include Rebecca Minkoff with her 'notification' bracelets and Tory Burch's designer excercise tracking bangle. 

And now Opening Ceremony are the latest to unveil their stylish digital device.

Opening Ceremony have collaborated with Intel to create the MICA smart bracelet

The American fashion brand unveiled their smart bracelet as part of their SS15 show on 7th September at New York Fashion Week.

The futuristic jewellery comes as part of a collaboration between the fashion brand and tech giants, Intel. 

The duo announced  their plans for the product back in January at the industry-leading CES conference in Las Vegas. 

The bracelet can perform functions such as alerting the wearer of meetings and SMS messages 

The snake skin effect bangles are set with semi-precious stones and look like a stylish new season accessory but holds several communication functions.

The MICA enables women to stay connected via SMS messages, meeting alerts, as well as general notifications delivered directly to the wrist, as well as wireless charging support. 

Additional features and functionalities are to be revealed at a later date and the product is expected to hit American stores around Christmas time. 

The bracelet comes as a result of the 'My Intelligent Communication Accessory,' project designed by Opening Ceremony, engineered by Intel. 

Golden touch: High-tech accessories, such as Tory Burch's Fitbit jewelry line are expected to dominate the spring trends at New York Fashion Week

High-tech high-fashion: Rebecca Minkoff is delving into wearable technology with the launch of two bracelets, including a notification bracelet that lights up when you receive a call or text from certain contacts 

Apple unveiled its first wearable accessory to a high-profile crowd on Tuesday, and it met with mixed reactions.  Style queen Gwen Stefani - who flew in on private jet with Dr Dre for the launch - is yet to divulge her opinion.

Targeting the style-conscious rather than tech-obsessed for the first time ever, the company is in brand new territory. 

But the Apple Watch is less of a risk and more an organic step into the next phase of Apple's development. They recently hired ex Burberry boss Angela Ahrendts, YSL's CEO Paul Deneve and - crucially - Patrick Pruniaux, ex Tag Heuer.

The gadget, which must be paired with an iPhone, debuts next year and prices start from £216 in the UK.

It comes in three versions - sport, standard, and a luxury edition, with finishes including stainless steel and gold plated. The display is highly customisable and wrist bands range from leather and stainless steel to sports models in hues from pink to blue. 

The Watch recognises voice commands and carries sensors that can track activity such as steps and heart rate.  

Style bible Vogue.com was complimentary in regards to its look.

'From a fashion point of view, the external aesthetic seemed neutral: neither super-stylish nor repellent. I would imagine that geeks would love it more than aesthetes,' writes Suzy Menkes.

'I suspect that I, as a non-digital specialist, would fail to use this device to its full capacity. But I like the idea of setting the visual aspects according to my mood. And perhaps my wardrobe.

'A bunch of violets to set off my purple outfits? Why not look at my watch - and dream.'

Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue, was a little less convinced: 'It is immaculate in terms of how function meets design,' she said.

'The issue is really about how much people want to wear something so clearly, essentially an amazing gadget.' 

Some fashionistas may prove reluctant to wear a smartwatch at all, said Sonny Vu, chief executive of Misfit Wearables, which makes an activity monitor that can be worn as a broach, on a necklace, or on a wrist band.

'Some female consumers are concerned about tan lines, for instance, and many might own a watch that has sentimental value', he said. 

Many of the fashion experts agreed that the most compelling wearables haven't hit the market yet.
