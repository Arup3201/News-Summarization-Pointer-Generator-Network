The Pentagon has shelled out an astonishing $1trillion on weapons since 9/11, with annual spending more than doubling over the past decade.

A report by security think tank The Stimson Center showed spending on tanks, ships and jets rose from $63billion in 2001 to $136billion in 2010.

But the Department of Defense spent $233billion of that $1trillion from ‘supplemental’ funding voted on aside from the main defence budget.

The report suggests the equipment of U.S. forces is in better shape than officials claim, but they still have one big reason to be afraid of cuts.

The supplemental funding is a concern because when it fades away, there won't be extra money for new and better arms, reported Time magazine.

Fears are mounting at the Pentagon over budget cuts and this report suggests U.S. forces have already modernised most of their equipment.

Officials are concerned likely cuts could stop them replacing equipment damaged in Iraq and Afghanistan, reported the New York Times.

Overspent: The Army bought 2,000 more Stryker ground vehicles than expected

Carbines: The Army bought more than three times as many M4 rifles as intended

But the report claimed 10 of the 14 most expensive weapons programmes have already received least 88 per cent of their projected financing.

‘I was surprised at how much they had already done,’ report author R. Russell Rumbaugh told the New York Times.

The Air Force and Navy received more money for weapons spending than the Army and Marines, he added.

‘There will always be debate over what forces and equipment our military should pursue, but we should not ignore significant advances,’ he wrote.

‘The military services used that funding, including that provided in the supplemental war funding, to modernise their forces.’

The Army bought 2,000 more Stryker ground vehicles than intended and more than three times as many M4 rifles as it first wanted.

In addition the Air Force purchased far more unmanned aircraft and cargo carriers than it had first anticipated, reported the New York Times.
