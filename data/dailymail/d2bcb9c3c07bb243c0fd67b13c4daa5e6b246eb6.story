Weighing 28 stone, Tracey Shellard claimed she was so unwell she could hardly walk and struggled even to make a cup of tea.

Over the years Shellard, 49, claimed almost £100,000 in benefits by detailing severe health problems linked to her obesity.

But her sob story, a court heard, turned out to be a big fat lie.

While receiving the benefits, Shellard went on a strict calorie-controlled diet and began to lose vast amounts of weight, slimming down to 10 stone.

Shamed: Tracey Shellard, 49, pictured leaving Manchester Crown Court, said she needed benefits because she could not even make a cup of tea due to her 28 stone weight

Yet she hid the news from the 
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Far from being incapable of 
looking after herself, she ditched her mobility scooter, began taking 
her dog on long walks and was fit enough to carry heavy shopping bags.

A covert surveillance operation was launched by the DWP, and she was spotted carrying a 32-inch television from the shops.

Eventually Shellard was arrested and 
hauled before the courts, where she admitted four charges of failing to 
notify of a change in circumstances.

She was branded a ‘lying scrounger’ 
by the judge at Manchester Crown Court, but was spared jail, despite a 
previous conviction for benefit fraud in the 1990s.

Jonathan Rogers, prosecuting, told 
the court that Shellard had been overpaid a total of £98,000, although 
she would have been entitled to £8,000 of the cash in tax credits if she
 had been honest.

She claimed disability living 
allowance from 2000, with payments increased to a higher rate after she 
detailed health problems linked to her obesity.

However, in 2008, Shellard began getting more exercise and lost eight stone. By 2011, she had lost a further ten stone.

'Lying scrounger': Tracey Shellard was blasted by the judge for claiming to be too fat to work - despite undergoing dramatic weight loss

After she was arrested in September 2011, she got a job at a nursing home, working up to 48 hours a week.

Shellard also lied about living alone to rake in income support, housing benefit, and council tax benefit.

In fact, she was living with her 
husband of 23 years, who was in work and supporting her financially. 
Denise Fitzpatrick, defending, said Shellard had ‘learned her lesson’.

Handing her a 12-month suspended 
sentence, with a six-month curfew and 80 hours of unpaid work, Recorder 
Craig Sephton QC said she had been ‘taking money this country  
desperately needs to serve your own ends’.

The  judge said he took into account that she had got a job and had completed training courses which meant she had made herself ‘a useful member of society instead of a sponger’.

Back in 2003, she had said in a DWP interview that she struggled to stand up again after sitting down, used a walking stick indoors, needed help to stop her ‘sliding off pillows’ in bed, couldn’t make a cup of tea without dropping it, and was dependent on a mobility scooter when she left the house.

She told officers: 'If I had help I would go everywhere - I just want to be normal, but I know that will never be.'
