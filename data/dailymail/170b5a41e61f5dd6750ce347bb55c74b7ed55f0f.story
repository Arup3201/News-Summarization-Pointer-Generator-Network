Rod Stewart falsely obtained a driving licence after asking a colleague to take his driving test for him.

The music superstar confessed to duping officials in his autobiography published last autumn.

Stewart, 68, recalled in the book how his road manager, Peter Saunders, volunteered to sit the driving test after becoming fed up with having to drive the singer around London.

He wrote: 'In the days before photographic licences
this was a fairly simple deception to pull off.

'Pete set off to the 
test centre, signed in as Mr Roderick Stewart of Highgate and took my 
test.

'And I passed, I’m pleased to say. To this day I have never taken a
driving test in Britain.'

At the wheel: Rod in one of his many beloved sports cars. But he has admitted that he was not technically allowed to drive them for years (not that it stopped him)

The Do Ya Think I'm Sexy? performer committed the fraud in 1967.

He carried on driving until he moved to America eight years later and took a driving test there.

He passed and now has a valid US licence which can be used in the UK.

In his book he also revealed how women threw themselves at him so much, he got tired of sex and wanted love.

‘There was a period in my life — and it wasn’t a prolonged one, maybe just a few years — where it was a bit “one in, one out”,’ admitted Rod.

‘The girls involved would never have known that, obviously.'
