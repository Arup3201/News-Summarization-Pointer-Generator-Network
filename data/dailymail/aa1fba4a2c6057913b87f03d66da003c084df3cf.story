Viewers were left choking on their cornflakes this morning after a testicular cancer check was carried out live on TV.

As part of a promotion for a campaign aimed at encouraging men to examine their testicles for signs of the disease, a volunteer was brought on to ITV's Lorraine to be checked on air by Dr Hilary Jones.

Referred to only as Charlie, the young man was asked to strip off and follow the GP's instructions as he guided him through the signs of what to look for when checking for cancer.

However, viewers, who tune into Lorraine Kelly's show in their millions, saw more than they bargained for - as there were close-up shots of the man's scrotum.

Dr Hilary said he hoped the demonstration, for the campaign #CheckYourChaps would encourage early detection of testicular and prostate cancer and commended Charlie on his bravery.

‘It takes a lot of balls to do something like that,’ he said, seemingly unaware of his double entendre.

Despite good intentions, some Lorraine viewers found watching the young man feeling his scrotum distasteful. 

'Eating my breakfast with my one-year-old granddaughter, I didn't want to see this at breakfast time. Time and a place for things like this, I love Lorraine but this is distasteful for morning viewing. Sorry,' one viewer posted on the website.

Other viewers took to Twitter to air their concerns. 

Amy Bowman wrote: 'Sat down to eat my breakfast, put the tele on and I see a pair of balls.'

Nathan Hodkin tweeted: 'I get that it's for a good cause and all that, but... really? At 5 past 9 in the morning? Mary Whitehouse will be spinning. #Lorraine' 

Twitter user @RobBot posted, 'Just turned ITV on while eating my toast to be faced with a pair of testicles, not what I expected #CheckYourChaps #Lorraine'

'Omg.... Its WAY too early to be seeing a pair of balls on #lorraine #ballsinyourface,' tweeted another shocked viewer, Leanne Ellen.

Others were more positive about the controversial demonstration

One viewer slammed the critics on the show's website 

'All for a good cause but that put me right off my boiled egg!.. #Lorraine,' read another surprised tweet. 

But some viewers were more positive about the controversial demonstration.

Margaret Littlewood retorted to the criticism on the shows website posting: 'Bit prudish of you and the 1 year old wouldn't be offended I'm sure, men do need to know how to do this'

While Derren John Luscombe Harvey added: 'I'm no doctor but I'm almost sure your 1 year old granddaughter has no idea what was on the telly this morning, spreading awareness of testicular cancer and how to check for signs is an important issue, sorry if it momentarily put you off your toast!'

It may not have helped digest breakfast but at least it was for a good cause

One twitter user felt it was not the right time to be faced with naked body parts on TV

As the demonstration kicked off, Dr Hilary guided Charlie through an examination. 'Cup your ball bag with your right hand,' he said.

'Whenever you look in the mirror to do this you might find that one testicle might be bigger or hangs lower than the other - this completely normal.

Dr Hilary, who recommended having a bath or warm shower before doing the check, continued: 'With the right hand put your thumb in front of the left testicle and fourth finger and middle finger behind it and roll the finger between the two.

Brian and Vogue made a visit to ITV show Lorraine to discuss Check Your Chaps on Monday

'Feel the contour of the testicle. It’s like an elongated egg and should be nice and smooth.

'You're feeling for any discreet lumps,' he explained. 

'If you do that from 14 to 45 you’ll detect any change,' Dr Hilary advised.

There are 2,300 cases of testicular cancer in the UK every year. There's a 98 per cent survival rate but those two per cent could be saved with greater awareness.

Dr Hilary told viewers: 'If everyone just did what Charlie just demonstrated,60 lives a year would be saved.'

Brian McFadden and his wife of two years, Vogue, joined forces to launch the campaign urging men to get tested for testicular and prostate cancer on yesterday's Lorraine.
