There have been worries she could be going off the rails since the death of her mother Whitney Houston.

And now Bobbi Kristina Brown has been caught on camera illegally gambling in Las Vegas just a day before her emotional appearance at last night's Billboard Awards.

The teenager was spotted playing slot machines while spending time with her 22-year-old boyfriend Nick Gordon.

It is against the law for anyone under the age of 21 to partake in any kind of gaming in Sin City.

In fact anyone under that age is forbidden from loitering on the casino floor.

Unfortunately for Bobbi, 19, an eagle-eyed casino user spotted her indulging at the MGM Resort and Casino,  and caught it on tape, and it was later leaked to TMZ.

It is unclear whether she actually made any money after her slot machine session,  though casinos usually require the production of an identity card before handing over large prizes.

The Nevada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board Deputy Chief David Salas told RumorFix , 'We will look into it.'

He also said the video isn’t enough evidence on it’s own and investigators need to do more research before charges can be pressed.

In addition the MGM Grand an internal investigation of its own into the footage.

Underage gambling is a misdemeanor in Nevada, and lawbreakers can be punished by up to 6 months in county jail or $1,000 fine, while the casino could face an even heavier financial penalty.

Representatives from the Houston family have yet to comment on the revelations.

She was in town to attend the music award ceremony on Sunday, where she accepted Millennium Award on her mother's behalf in the show's most emotional moment.
