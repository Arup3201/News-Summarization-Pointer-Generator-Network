Birmingham City have rejected a £1.5million bid from Bournemouth for prodigious teenage winger Demarai Gray.

Gray has attracted plenty of attention since breaking through at St Andrew’s and announced himself to the Championship with a hat-trick against Reading in early December.

But Birmingham are under no pressure to sell and remain determined to keep one of their most promising academy graduates at the club.

Birmingham City have rejected a £1.5m bid from Bournemouth for teenage star Demarai Gray

The 18-year-old winger has announced himself this season with a string of impressive performances 

Liverpool and Tottenham have maintained a watchful eye of Gray, a quick and technically-gifted player, while Crystal Palace had a £500,000 bid rejected in the summer.

Gray’s contract has 18 months left to run and his he is in discussions about an extension. Gary Rowett has previously told Sportsmail: ‘He’s as good as any young player I’ve seen at this age. He gets the fans off the edge of their seats. 

'I would expect if someone does want to buy him he’s not going to come cheap. There are not many young British players around who can go past people, are quick, and can score goals.’ 

Bournemouth are determined to bolster their attacking options by bringing in a speedy winger in the January transfer window and are now trying to negotiate a £5million deal for Wigan’s Callum McManaman, as Sportsmail has reported.
