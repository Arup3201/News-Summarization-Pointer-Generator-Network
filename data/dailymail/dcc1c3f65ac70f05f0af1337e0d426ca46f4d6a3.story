Neymar won't be heralded as a true footballing star until he wins the World Cup, believes newly-appointed Brazil coach Dunga.

The 22-year-old forward was the poster boy of the five-time World Cup winners' ambitions to triumph on home soil this summer.

Things to work on: Neymar isn't a true footballing star, according to Brazil coach Dunga

Not impressed: Dunga believes Neymar has to win the World Cup with Brazil before he can earn that praise

He scored four goals in five matches for the 2014 hosts before his tournament was pre-maturely ended with a back injury sustained against Colombia in the quarter-finals.

Dunga says the Barcelona man is the best player in his homeland but he can't claim that status on a global level until he becomes a World Cup winner.

'He's the best player in Brazil but no star. To have star status, you have to have world champion credentials on your back,' Dunga said.

'But we are going to work to make sure that, when he's with the Selecao, Neymar performs above the level that defines a star.'

In a heap: Neymar's World Cup was pre-maturely ended after suffering a back injury in the quarter-finals
