They are usually considered the preserve of students and are stacked high with bunk beds in huge dormitories.

But the world of hostels is changing, with stylish design, historic buildings and even private rooms offered in return for a budget stay.

In fact, the competition to be the most cutting-edge accommodation is so fierce that an awards has been created just to gauge the best hostels in the world - the Hoscars.  

The Bounce hostel in Sydney, Australia ranked highly in the 'Hoscar' Awards for its incredible rooftop terrace overlooking the city

Run by booking site Hostelworld.com, the awards recognise the stunning budget properties around the world, judging them on categories including value for money, location, atmosphere, facilities, security, character and cleanliness.

One million travellers decided the results, with some unusual properties receiving recognition, from one that aims to feel like the family home to another inspired by bananas. 

The categories are broken down into size of the property, as well as continent, country and city picks, but what was particularly surprising this year was Asia's rise to prominence.

Though Southeast Asia has long been a popular destination for backpackers, hostels in Asia increased their share in the Hoscar awards by 16 per cent this year, with Japan taking home six awards.

One such favourite is the Banana Hostel in Taiwan, which actually won two Hoscars this year, due to its quirky design aesthetic.

Catering to millennials with a taste for industrial-chic spaces on a budget, the hotel certainly lives up to its name - fresh bananas are provided every morning and home-made banana bread every weekend.  

At the Banana Hostel in Taiwan, which won two Hoscar Awards this year, fresh bananas are provided every morning and home-made banana bread is freshly baked on weekends

Taipei's Banana Hostel is also noted for its chic, industrial design - on a budget - and bright accent decor

Unsurprisingly, Europe took home over half of all Hoscars, with Portuguese hostels picking up more awards than any other country in the world.

Between the country's decadent old buildings, stunning surroundings and artsy, bohemian vibe, Home Lisbon Hostel scooped up the award for best European hostel this year, followed closely by Yes! Lisbon Hostel. 

Housed in a 200-year-old building, Home Lisbon Hostel features a comfortable living room, dining room with bar, fully-stocked kitchen and decor that's reminiscent of mum's house.

In Portugal, Home Lisbon Hostel is owned by 'Mamma,' who also provides traditional Portuguese meals for her guests each evening

At the Ostello Venezia, one of the lounges is decorated in an artsy, bohemian aesthetic, complete with bright high-backed armchairs

For minimalist, pod-like lounge designs, check in to FIAP Jean Monnet hostel in Paris, France, which has 480 beds and an on-site cafeteria

And true to it's name, the hostel even hosts Mamma's Dinners: tasty, wholesome and authentic Portuguese mediterranean feasts, cooked and prepared by the owner of the property herself.

Some of her specialties include 'Bacalhau com Natas,' which is baked codfish in a cream sauce and 'Arroz de Pato,' a classic duck and rice dish. 

Not to be beat, Yes! Lisbon Hostel offers free walking tours, pub crawl evenings out and - of course - a family dinner-style meal. For just €10 any guest of the hostel can get a starter, main dish and dessert, plus three drinks of your choice.

For a room with a view, look no further than Sydney's Bounce Hostel, which has racked up many mentions over the past two years.

The modern upmarket property has air-conditioning in every room, three lounges and an incredible rooftop terrace and BBQ area with breathtaking views of the city's skyline. 

France's top offering, the Hostel Gastama in Lille, offers comfortable sleeping arrangements and a friendly bar, with 12 draught beers on tap

Equity Point Marrakech is really more of a spa than a hostel, offering an outdoor swimming pool, Hammam treatments and massages

Best Small Hostel: Adventure Queenstown Hostel - Queenstown, New Zealand

Best Medium Hostel: Home Lisbon Hostel - Lisbon, Portugal

Best Large Hostel: Kinlay Eyre Square Hostel - Galway, Ireland

Best Extra-Large Hostel: PLUS Berlin - Berlin, Germany

The Generator Venice hostel in Italy is another architectural marvel with stunning wood beams and stone columns decorating the property's popular cafe.

While Equity Point Marrakech offers a spa experience on a budget - think: swimming pool, Hammam treatments and massages - designed to help you unwind alongside the hostel's tradition courtyard and Moroccan fountain.

There is also a rooftop terrace and a chef on staff to prepare traditional meals. 

The quirky furnishings inside Ostello Bello Milan takes top prize in the Italian hostel category - and with good reason.

Located just 500 metres from the famous Duomo Square, the property offers free WiFi, free shampoo and soaps, free linen and towels, free coffee and even free dinner at the hostel's Italian Aperitivo. Sensing a theme?

There are three open air terraces, with hammocks and BBQs, as well as musical instruments for guest use and a DJ set on-site every Wednesday.  

Ostello Bello in Milan took home the top title in the Italian hostel category thanks to its many (and we do mean many) free ammenities

St Christopher's Inn in Paris offers a female-only floor, known as 'The Oasis,' and a popular bar downstairs, called Belushi's Party Bar

Hostelworld.com's CEO, Feargal Mooney, commented on this year's awards: 'Our annual Hoscars are the ultimate seal of approval within the budget travel industry. 

'The awards are based on almost a million real reviews and ratings by guests who have stayed in the hostels over the last 12 months. 

'So we can say with some authority that these are the best hostels in the world right now. 

'We would like to congratulate all the winners on their success - particularly our partners in Asia - who took home a record number of awards this year.'
