Police are to re-open an investigation into the Birmingham pub bombings that killed 21 people nearly 40 years ago, it has been revealed.

Detectives will open a cold-case probe into who carried out the suspected IRA attacks in November  1974, which also injured 182 people.

In 1991 six men, known as the Birmingham Six, were released from prison after spending 17 years behind bars when their convictions for the bombings were quashed by the Court of Appeal.

Since their release families of the victims have launched dozens of appeals to have the case re-opened.

Yesterday, the head of counter terrorism at West Midlands Police said he wants forensic experts to review potential new evidence.

Detective
Chief Superintendent Kenny Bell, head of Counter Terrorism at West 
Midlands Police, has made the commitment in a letter to the sister of 
one of the atrocity.

He wrote to Julie Hambleton, 49, 
whose sister Maxine was killed in the bombings aged just 18, saying: 
'Forensic science continues to develop. I will ensure that we consult 
with a forensic expert to establish how science has advanced and if new 
techniques can evidentially assist us with bringing those responsible to
justice.'

The city's head of counter terrorism is also tasking officers to bring together and look again at all the old files in the case.

He
wrote: 'It is important we gather, understand, consolidate and preserve
all relevant material in one central repository. While the scale of 
this is a huge undertaking, it will greatly assist with our ability to 
assess the relevance of any new evidence.

'It will also give me confidence in providing you with information that is accurate.'

Det Chf Supt Bell promised to give the victims' families regular updates on the process of gathering the evidence.

West Midlands Police had never officially reopened the case after the Birmingham Six had their convictions quashed.

Paddy Joe Hill, Hugh Callaghan, 
Richard McIlkenny, Gerry Hunter, Billy Power and Johnny Walker spent 17 
behind bars before being released.

Detectives
last month revealed they are to launch a murder investigation into the Bloody Sunday deaths of 
13 civilians shot dead by British soldiers in Londonderry more than 40 
years ago.

The probe will last at least four 
years and raises the possibility that former British soldiers – some now
in their 70s and 80s – could stand trial facing criminal charges.

Thirty officers will focus on the 
actions of UK paratroopers following the findings of the £195million 
inquiry by Lord Saville which said none of those killed were armed and 
no warning was given before soldiers opened fire.

All six men, all Irish, all Catholic, had been drinking in a 
pub at New Street station in Birmingham on November 21, 1974 before boarding a train to catch
a ferry to Belfast.

Within six minutes, bombs exploded in two pubs on 
the station precincts, destroying the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern.

Twenty one people were killed and many of the victims were aged between 17 and 25. Warnings were sent but police did not evacuate people in time.

The men, all carrying mass cards, were travelling
to the funeral of a friend, an IRA man who had blown himself up whilst 
assembling a bomb. They were all Republican sympathisers.

In court they claimed
they had confessed only after being beaten by police but the court did 
not believe them and so began their long battle for 
justice.

The Provisional Irish Republican Army 
(IRA) has always been widely blamed for the attacks although it has 
always denied responsibility.

Det Chief Supt 
Bell said of his team's new efforts: 'This task will take some 
considerable time, however, I undertake that you will receive updates on
a bimonthly basis.'

The written assurances back up what 
Mrs Hambleton claims she was told in a meeting with the top officer at the 
force's Lloyd House HQ.

She
has spearheaded the Justice for the 21 campaign calling for the pub 
bombing murders to be reinvestigated - and is now optimistic a 
breakthrough could finally be made.

She said: 'We've had so many false 
dawns before that we are quite cautious, but we're hopeful new evidence 
can be uncovered that could lead police to the killers.

'He said it would take months to centralise the files, bundle them into segments and then be scanned by a small team to enable him to fully answer the questions we have asked him.

'What we want to know is how much physical evidence there was from the bombing itself like clothing for example or debris which might contain DNA evidence.

'If the Stephen Lawrence murder trial came about because of a blood splatter on a jumper, then there must be some evidence from the bombings which can help trace the killers.

'I am encouraged that Mr Bell will get the evidence in one place but there is still a hell of a long way to go before those who are responsible will be brought to justice.

'It is appalling that in a civilised country the mass murder of 21 innocent people has not been investigated and those who committed the atrocity have been allowed to go free.

'Maxine was just 18 when she was killed. She had been accepted to study Law at Leicester University but she never lived to see the letter of acceptance, she would have been 56 this month.'

Earlier this year, Birmingham Six member Paddy Hill divulged a list of names to police whom he claimed were responsible for the bombings.

Meanwhile, the Justice for the 21 campaign has been backed by MPs and MEPs across the country including Chancellor George Osborne.

A petition calling for the bombings to be re-investigated has been signed by more than 2,200 people.
