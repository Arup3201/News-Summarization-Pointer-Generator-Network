Cincinnati Reds pitcher Aroldis Chapman has shared an image of his stapled head on Instagram after undergoing surgery for a horrific injury suffered during a training game last Wednesday.

The 26-year-old was hit in the face by a line drive after pitching a 99mph ball against the Kansas City Chiefs in Surprise, Arizona.

The impact broke bones above his left eye and nose, causing him to be taken to the nearby Banner Good Samaritan Medical Centre for further tests.

On the mend: Cincinnati Reds pitcher Aroldis Chapman shows off his stapled head after undergoing surgery

Pitch: Chapman fires off a 99mph pitch towards Salvador Perez of the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday night in Arizona

Road to recovery: Chapman could be pitching again within a month if his recovery goes as planned

He has since undergone successful surgery, having had a titanium plate embedded in his skull to help heal the fracture.

Chapman, who is nicknamed The Cuban Missile, posted the image of his head on the social networking site along with a message in Spanish translated as: 'My fans, everything is fine, thanks to God we are already out of any kind of trouble. Iâ€™m here waiting for them to give me my release.'

Surprisingly Chapman only had a slight concussion and there is a chance he could be pitching again within a month.

Return: Perez rifles back the ball towards Chapman (left) who is still following through on his pitch at the stadium in Surprise, Arizona and (right) the ball can be seen as a white speck just above Chapman's left arm about to hit his face

Contact: The ball ricochets off Chapman's face at speed - causing him to raise his left hand to his face in agony

The hard-throwing left-hander was 
struck by Salvador Perez's liner with two outs in the sixth inning â€” the
 pitch was clocked at 99 mph.

Chapman crumbled to the ground, face down, his legs flailing.

The
 ball caromed into the third base dugout. Medical personnel, including 
Royals Dr. Vincent Key, rushed onto the field. Blood could be seen on 
the mound.

Perez put 
his hands on his helmet before reaching first base. He immediately went 
to the mound where players from both teams huddled as the 26-year-old 
Cuban reliever was being attended to in an eerily silent stadium.

Collapse: Chapman falls to the ground as concerned team mates and umpires dash over to help him as he writhes in agony on the floor

Prayers: Cincinnati Reds players and Kansas City Chief players kneel as Chapman receives urgent medical care on the field on Wednesday night

Treatment: Cincinnati Reds closer Aroldis Chapman is taken off the field after being hit by a line drive Wednesday night March 19, 2014, after another frightening incident involving a pitcher being struck by a batted ball

An ambulance's siren could be heard in the background while Chapman was loaded onto the stretcher.

'It was an absolute bullet that Sal hit,' Royals manager Ned Yost said. 'It's just a real sickening feeling for everybody.'

After undergoing surgery at a hospital in Phoenix, Chapman is expected to spend a few days recovering before returning home.
