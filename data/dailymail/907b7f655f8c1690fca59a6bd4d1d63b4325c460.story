A California man who shot at another man in a heated dispute Wednesday and then fled in a pickup truck has died following a standoff with Santa Ana police.

Police say the man shot at and missed another man during a fight over a woman Wednesday afternoon.

Officers were told the gunman fled in a white pickup, which was spotted and chased down. The suspect then shot himself in a failed suicide attempt, reports NBC Los Angeles.

He could be seen inside the truck and ignored repeated orders to drop the gun. A hail of police bullets then rang out.

Cpl. Anthony Bertagna says the standoff ended when the man shot himself under the chin before getting out of the car while carrying the gun.

'My boss pulled us inside,' said Karina Moreno, who works nearby at a hardware store off of which at least one bullet from the crime scene ricocheted. 

'We ran inside, we were afraid of the bullets. I started crying. It was really, really sad.' 

The unidentified man died at Western Medical Center.

No officers were hurt in the standoff.
