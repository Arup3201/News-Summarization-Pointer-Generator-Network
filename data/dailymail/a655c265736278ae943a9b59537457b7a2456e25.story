As a zoologist, explorer and  nature programme presenter, I’ve always loved animals. But when it comes to picking a favourite, I’m not interested in the usual furry pandas or cheeky meerkats.

No, in my opinion, the best animals by far are sloths — nature’s most misunderstood creature. Sloths get a lot of undeserved bad press.

Let’s face it, being named after one of the seven deadly sins was never going to be a good start.

So spa so good: Sloths with skin problems take the occasional splash in green tea, which keeps their skin healthy. They're surprisingly good swimmers, but don't like bathtime and often look very sorry for themselves

They spend more than 70 per cent of their time resting and move incredibly slowly, which means they’re often dismissed as lazy and stupid.

But their chilled-out nature is what helps them to survive in the jungles of South America, their native habitat.

They are the masters of staying silent and hidden from predators.

Beyond the pail: Buckets are the sloth's favourite way to travel at the sanctuary. It's fast and means they can snooze on the move. Naturally solitary in the wild, they're paired up with a sloth 'cuddle partner' when they arrive at the sanctuary, and enjoy chilling out together

Toy story: Babies cling to their mothers for the first 12 months before going it alone, so orphaned sloths get stuffed toys to hug instead. Baby Matteo refuses to be separated from his giraffe called Mr Moo

Sloth style: These little chaps can't control their own body temperature like other mammals, and nights can be chilly for the orphans without a mummy to cling to. So the sanctuary make special onesies, crafted from sports socks, to keep them cosy

They’ve been around for a long time, too: fossils have revealed some of their ancestors grew to the size of elephants, had claws and ate leaves much like the present-day versions.

These cuddly couch potatoes are among the smartest, eco-friendliest, cutest and most amazing animals on the planet. And I’m on a one-woman mission to prove it.

I’m so passionate about these tree-hugging balls of fluff that in 2010, I travelled thousands of miles from my home in London to Costa Rica, where I visited the Aviarios sloth sanctuary — the world’s first sanctuary for injured and orphaned sloths — to meet 150 of them.

Hanging tough: Sloths in the wild spend their lives hanging in trees. Their long arms and four-inch curved claws keep them hooked to the branches. Babies at the sanctuary have a daily workout on the climbing frame

Safe and snuggly: Orphans often arrive with broken bones after falling from trees or being hit by cars, so the sanctuary has its own 'slothspital' to treat injuries

Your cue: Sloths do everything upside down - eating, sleeping, mating, giving birth - and climb down from the trees just once a week to answer the call of nature. So playing a trick shot on the pool table is no problem

Founded 20 years ago, the sanctuary cares for sloths who have fallen from trees (either breaking bones or being separated from the mothers they’d normally cling to for the first year of life), been the victim of attacks by dogs or even run over on the roads that cut across their natural jungle habitat. 

There, I fell in love with their sweet smiles, slow-mo lifestyles and innate hugability.

I vowed to change public attitudes, making people see that being slothful is a virtue, not a sin. I’ve since made a documentary about them called Meet The Sloths for the Animal Planet channel.

Where's Wally? This little fellow was rescued by locals and named Wally. He took a long time to learn how to climb upwards. However, he hasn't yet learned to reverse, and often has to be rescued from the top of the climbing frame by members of staff

Basket case: In the wild, sloths eat leaves that would poison other animals - it takes their stomachs four weeks to digest each meal, breaking down the toxins. So, while they might look lazy, inside their bodies are hard at work

I’ve also launched the Sloth Appreciation Society, and even created sloth fans along the way, such as Ricky Gervais and actor Ashton Kutcher, who have spread the word about these wonderful animals on Twitter.

Now, I’m sharing my Sloth Sanctuary photo albums with the world in a new book, The Power Of Sloth.

Once you’ve read it, I promise you’ll never look at these mellow fellows in the same light. Not convinced? Let me talk you through some of my favourite snaps...
