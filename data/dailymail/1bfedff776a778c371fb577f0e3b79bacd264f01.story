Getting fit is one of the most commonly made New Year's resolution, but in the toughest month of the year for financial worries, getting fit is often an expensive task.

It's also a handy excuse if you are only half serious about toning your tummy and thighs. 

But now there one less excuse to stop you from getting healthy - Poundland has launched a range of fitness products for just £1 per item.

Poundland has launched a range of 37 fitness products that cost just £1 each

In response to ever-increasing exercise costs, Poundland has launched a new range of fitness products 

The discount store is now selling everything from free weights and protein shakes to yoga mats and sports bottles.  

The range has come at a welcome time for people in low income households - a recent report found a yearly gym membership for a council-run venue now costs £368 on average, with evening fitness classes at £5.95 per visit.

Separate research has also found the average Briton will spend more than £37,000 on health and fitness fads in their lifetime.

Poundland are now hoping their 37-piece range of £1 fitness products will be enticing to Brits who can't afford these prices.

The low-cost retailer's new ActivLife range also includes weight gloves, protein bars, work out towels, skipping ropes and gym bags. 

That's 25p less than a 550ml bottle of Coca Cola, 1p more expensive than a McDonalds cheeseburger and  almost a third of the price of a red velvet Hummingbird bakery cupcake. 

Poundland's 37-strong ActivLife range features £1 fitness products for gym go-ers on a budget

The range includes handheld weights and weight gloves, protein shakes and bars, water bottles and work out towels

Poundland's buying team expects best sellers to include the skipping rope with jump counter, the 0.5kg weights, the protein bars and shakes and the stretch exercise band.

A spokesperson said: 'At this time of year, as the bills begin to pile up and January's payday is still some way off, people want better value for money and cheaper alternatives to spend money on when it comes to getting fit.

'The cost of gym memberships and classes has a huge impact on millions of people across the country who just want to get fitter and more active, without overpaying. 

'We are stepping in and making getting fit more affordable and more accessible to everyone.'
