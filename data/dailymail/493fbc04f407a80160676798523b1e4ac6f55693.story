Southampton striker Shane Long has reassured fans that his condition is improving after posting a picture from his hospital bed.

The 28-year-old was taken off injured after suffering suspected broken ribs during his side's 3-2 defeat by Crystal Palace in the FA Cup on Saturday.

Long was taken straight to hospital, but posted a picture online suggesting he was on the road to recovery.

Shane Long tweeted from his hospital bed reassuring fans that he was on the road to recovery 

He said: 'Thanks for all the tweets guys. Feeling a lot better today and am on the mend. Here's to a speedy recovery.'

Saints manager Ronald Koeman travelled to hospital after the defeat to check up on the striker.

He said: 'I spoke to the doctor and he thought he will have fractured one or two ribs and that's very painful. 

'It's a pity because we don't have that number of players to go with all the injuries that we have.

'I don't know (how long he'll be out for). Normally three, four, five weeks.'
