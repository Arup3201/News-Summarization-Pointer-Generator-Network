Police have decided to prosecute Ed Balls for driving away from a crash, it emerged today.

The Shadow Chancellor revealed he will be charged over the incident in a blog on his website.

Mr Balls, who now faces the threat of losing his licence, bumped into another car when trying to turn his car round 'in a tight spot' in his constituency.

Ed Balls attempted to perform a 'seven point turn' in this street, but crashed into another car

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has a long record of motoring offences - including speeding, talking on a mobile and, now, failing to stop after a bump

Last month's bump was the fourth time in recent years that Mr Balls has landed himself in trouble behind the wheel.

In 2013, he received three points for driving through a red light on the Embankment near Westminster in London.

The same year he was caught speeding in his constituency in West Yorkshire. He was clocked driving at 56mph in a 50mph zone.

Mr Balls paid a 
fine and attended a speed awareness course rather than accept penalty 
points.

And in 2010, the Labour heavyweight admitted 'stupidity' after being caught talking on his mobile phone while driving.

As
 a cabinet minister at the time, he was fined £60 and given three points
 on his licence - although these points have now expired.

But instead of alerting the owner of the damaged black Peugeot 306, Mr Balls drove off. He said that he had no idea he had caused any damage.

Pictures at the time showed Mr Balls’ ageing Ford Mondeo estate clearly showing scratch marks on the bumper, but his spokesman insisted they were the result of police taking a paint sample from the vehicle.

At the time West Yorkshire Police confirmed officers were making inquiries into a ‘fail to stop collision’ on Saturday, April 5.

‘Damage was caused to the front offside wing of a parked black Peugeot 306. Enquiries are continuing,’ a spokesman said.

The Peugeot’s 32-year-old owner Dan Rowley – who has never voted – said he did not realise there was damage until the following day.

Mr Balls said he only found out that he had damaged the other motor when he was contacted by officers a week later.

Mr Balls today claimed the police had no choice but to charge him and insisted he accepted it fully.

He revealed that he would be getting points on his licence as a result. A spokesman told MailOnline that he could receive between five and 10 points.

On his blog today the Shadow Chancellor wrote: 'I’d been turning our car round in a tight spot in the narrow private drive beside the Labour rooms in Morley where I park all the time.

'Another car was parked close by and I was aware the two bumpers touched. But I had no idea any damage had been done until the police got in touch a week later.

'As soon as I was aware any damage had
 been done I immediately took full responsibility for any damage caused.
 I’ve been in touch with the owner to apologise for the inconvenience 
and to  pay for the repair to the marks on the parked car’s bodywork.

Ed Balls is one of the most divisive politicians in Westminster. David Cameron regularly picks him out during Prime Minister's Questions

'The
 police have to do their job. Once I’d confirmed I knew the bumpers had 
touched, their standard approach is to proceed to charge as they expect 
people to stop and check.

'I
 fully understand and accept that, so of course I will be accepting the 
charge. While I had no knowledge at the time that any damage had 
occurred, I accept their view that I should have checked. Getting points
 on my licence will be a blow – but that’s the way it works.'

The scrape was caught on CCTV camera and Balls's registration number was traced after the Peugeot's driver spotted some damage the following day.

Mr Balls revealed last month that he had been issued with a 'notice of intention to prosecute' by the police over the 'fail-to-stop collision'.

The offence could land Mr Balls with a fine of up to £5,000. In the most serious cases, offenders can be hit with a jail sentence of up to six months.

Last month Sergeant Adrian Wright, of West Yorkshire police, said: 'We received a report on Sunday 6 April of a fail-to-stop collision on Commercial Street, Morley, which is reported to have happened the day before on Saturday 5 April.

'Damage was caused to the front offside wing of a parked black Peugeot 306. Inquiries are ongoing.'

Today a West Yorkshire Police spokesman insisted they were still consulting with prosecutors and no formal decision had been taken to proceed.

Mr Balls could potentially have to appear before magistrates even if he admitted the offence.

While he could be banned from driving it is unlikely as he currently only has three
penalty points on his licence.

If he was stripped of his licence he faces a mammoth trip from his Yorkshire constituency. He would have to take the train from Morley to Leeds before changing for London. Once in the capital, around three hours later, he would have to take the tube to Westminster.

During the week he could either catch a lift to work with his wife - the Labour MP Yvette Cooper - or get the bus to Monument from his home in Stoke Newington, north London. He would then have to change onto the District Line to Westminster.
