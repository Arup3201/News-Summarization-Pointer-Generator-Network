Sunderland are closing on a loan deal for Chelsea winger Christian Atsu.

The 22-year-old, who has also been a target for Everton, has been on loan at Vitesse but did not figure in last night's 3-1 friendly win for Chelsea after opening talks with Sunderland.

Manager Gus Poyet is also awaiting confirmation of a deal for Liverpool's Fabio Borini - Sunderland offered Â£14m for the Italian but, after his shoulder injury against Roma, the deal was almost called off.

Transfer: Chelsea's Ghanain winger could be heading north after Sunderland approached him for a loan

Liverpool's failed pursuit of Loic Remy was another stumbling block in the transfer but it is thought both clubs are keen to make the deal happen and Guy Poyet is now sure he has his man

The Uruguayan manager has also made an offer to Lazio for Luis Pedro Cavanda. The 23-year-old is a versatile full-back and with the departure of Phil Bardsley and Andrea Dossena the Black cats are looking short in that department.

Marcos Alonso is another option after impressing on loan at the club last season, but so far Sunderland have failed to agree on personal terms.

Injury: Fabio Borini's shoulder injury put his move to Sunderland in doubt but the deal is now back on

Utility man: Luis Pedro Cavanda is a right-back, but can play on the left hand side as well
