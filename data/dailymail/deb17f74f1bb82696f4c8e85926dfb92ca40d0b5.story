FA chairman Greg Dyke could not have picked a more painfully appropriate title for his latest read – A Death in Brazil.

The beleaguered boss was pictured engrossed in the book while England trained in Belo Horizonte ahead of Tuesday’s dead-rubber against Costa Rica.

Sir Trevor Brooking also seemed interested in Dyke's read

But the title of Dyke’s read could well tell the story of England’s disastrous World Cup campaign.

Hodgson’s humiliated squad will return to the UK on Wednesday having been eliminated at the group stage for the first time since 1958 after defeats to Italy and Uruguay.

Dyke, though, made the bizarre decision to guarantee Hodgson’s future as boss on Friday afternoon, just half an hour before Costa Rica’s Bryan Ruiz scored the goal which confirmed England’s early exit.

For the record, his book – by Peter Robb - tells the story of Brazil’s history and the distance between the rich and the poor which still exists in the country.

It is the distance between England and the top teams at this World Cup, however, which should be his chief concern over the coming weeks.
