Joan Edwards’s solicitors yesterday tried to clear themselves of any blame over the spinster’s bequest to the nation finding its way into party coffers.

West Country solicitors Davis Wood initially refused to comment on the case for reasons of ‘client confidentiality’ but then produced an ambiguous statement.

It said: ‘At the time of the instructions received from the late Miss Edwards, the solicitor specifically checked with Miss Edwards about the unusual nature of her proposed bequest and it was confirmed by Miss Edwards at the time of her instructions that her estate was to be left to whichever political party formed the Government at the date of her death.’

Peter Wood, partner at Davis Wood Solicitors, the firm which drew up Joan Edwards's will in 2001

This statement again failed to provide any evidence that Miss Edwards intended to make a generous gift to the Tories and Lib Dems.

Richard Roberts, who chairs the Law Society’s wills and equity committee, said: ‘Wills are construed extremely tightly and I have now seen a copy of Miss Edwards’s will. It does say quite specifically “for whichever government” . . . it does not say “for which political party shall form the government”.

‘If that’s what Miss Edwards intended, the solicitors writing the will should have said that. They didn’t.’

Asked if the verbal clarification secured by the executors trumped what was written down, Mr Roberts said: ‘No. The will is crystal-clear on the face of it.

‘Solicitors who prepare wills know 
perfectly well they have to avoid ambiguity. It is regrettable but it 
appears they did not actually interpret her instructions clearly.’

Miss
Edwards died last year and had no husband or children. Her will was 
drawn up by the Bristol-based firm run by experienced partners James 
Davis and Peter Wood. On Tuesday afternoon, after obtaining a copy of 
the will, the Mail rang Davis Wood and was put through to Mr Wood. He 
declined to comment, on the basis of ‘confidentiality’, so the Mail 
emailed a series of questions asking who was responsible for 
interpreting the will as meaning she wanted her money to go to 
‘political parties’.

Mr Wood again declined to comment, citing the same professional reason. The political parties, on the other hand, had no such qualms.

By late afternoon, as the buck was being passed frantically around Whitehall, a consensus was emerging that it must surely be all the fault of the executors.

Former midwife Joan Edwards dedicated her life to public service and then left £520,000 as a gift to the nation when she died.

Here is how the Government could put her money to use within her beloved NHS:

Sources at the Lib Dems and the Tories were actively briefing against the small West Country firm.

Both parties maintained the first they had heard of Joan Edwards was when the solicitors phoned up with the welcome news she had left them some money. The Lib Dems insisted: ‘The decision to give the money to political parties was taken solely by the executors of the will.’ A Tory spokesman added: ‘The solicitors for the deceased informed the Conservative Party that it was a beneficiary of the will.’

By yesterday morning, heavyweights on all sides of the political spectrum were urging that the money be repaid, and by 11am, the Lib Dems and Tories had announced they were giving up their windfalls.

The will was drafted on September 17, 2001, without mentioning political parties at all. Instead, it stated she wanted her money to go to ‘whichever government is in office at the date of my death for the government in their absolute discretion to use as they may think fit’.

Edward Fraser, a wills specialist at London solicitors Colemans CTTS, added: ‘It seems to be very ambiguous and unusual how it was drafted by the solicitor. It is very woolly.

‘I would not have approached it like this. If she gave these instructions, they should have been crystalised in a “letter of wishes”, so her executors had proper guidance.’

The Mail asked Davis Wood solicitors whether anything had been put in writing at the time, among a series of further questions yesterday, but has yet to receive a reply.
