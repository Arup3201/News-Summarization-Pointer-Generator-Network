Former NBA star Robert Swift, estimated to have earned $20 million during his once promising career, has finally left his former Seattle home where he had been squatting since it fell into foreclosure last summer.

The one time number one draft pick for the Seattle Supersonics moved out of the property last weekend, enabling new owners Eric Dalzell and wife Jessica Ko to move in two months after they purchased the property.

When the new owners entered the house for the first time on Monday they were shocked and disgusted at the squalid conditions in which Swift and his girlfriend had been living for some time.

The deck at the back of property was covered in countless dog feces, while in the kitchen every surface was piled high was near empty bottles of alcohol and pizza boxes.

In fact empty bottles of alcohol and bottles of prescription drugs, including antidepressants, were found throughout the property, although there were no signs of any illegal drugs, Dalzell told Mailonline.

Multiple guns were found throughout the home, mostly air guns but also a handgun and ammunition.

The basement of the property had clearly been used as a makeshift shooting range and the building's foundations and load-bearing beams were riddled with bullet holes.

Elsewhere several walls had massive holes which could have been created by someone either punching them or hitting them with heavy objects. The entire 6,240 square foot home had an unpleasant odor.

‘The first thing you get when you walk 
in the door is the kind of whiff of whatever is festering in here,’ Jessica Ko told KOMO. The new owners only married in September and this is their first home together.

As well as the damage and degradation, 
Dalzell and Ko found many of Swift's personal possessions littering the 
rooms, including letters, photos and other mementos of his once 
promising career.

The new owners have spent several days clearing some of the damage but estimate it will be another two months before they will be able to move in.

Swift purchased the four beds, four and half baths house for $1.35million in 2006, but the new owners purchased it for just half that amount.

The extent of the interior damage has shocked the couple even though from the exterior it had clearly been a blot on the landscape of the wealthy Eastside suburb for some time.

The garden was littered with
empty Budweiser, Four Loko and Coors Light cans, while a sign attached 
to the front door reads ‘Danger men drinking.’

some time. One is missing a bonnet and engine.

It is a tragic fall from grace for 
Swift who was a number one draft pick for the Sonics in 2004. He played 
for Seattle, Oklahoma City, and eventually ended his unfulfilled career 
prematurely in Japan.

When KOMO tried to speak with Swift
two weeks ago, a woman claiming to be his girlfriend said he couldn't speak because he was asleep after taking pills.

Swift's current whereabouts is unknown, but there are growing concerns for his mental well-being after months of
living in such disgusting conditions.
