More than 70 cats have been taken from the Florida home of an elderly woman, who had been rescuing the animals for ten years.

Conditions inside the Fort Myers Shore home were so bad that animal control officers wore hazardous-waste suits during the seven-hour rescue operation.

The homeowner, Sandra Berkshire, is living with friends, and her 72 cats are being cared for at a shelter after her house was declared unlivable.

Tough conditions: Animal control workers wore face masks and hazardous-waste suits as they carried the cats outside

Tip off: The 72 cats were found in the house after an anonymous caller contacted animal control

The stash of cats was discovered after an anonymous tip off, and animal control officers say conditions inside the home were horrifying.

'The house is absolutely jam-packed with
 cats stacked on cats, in cages, and a house full of feces, urine,' Lieutenant 
Tony Backhurst, of Lee County Domestic Animal Services, said.

He told NBC 2 that it was hard to breathe inside the home, and said those removing the cats were unable to stay inside for long.

Neighbors of Ms Berkshire say she had taken the cats in as an attempt to help them, but that the situation had got out of control.Â 

'She's loving, caring. And she talks about how she's saved a few and gives them away, finds loving homes,' Adam Rudd said.

Another
 neighbor, Geof Greene, also defended Ms Berkshire, saying: 'She was 
taking care of the cats, she was feeding them every week... no matter 
how many were in there. She was on top of it.'

Good intentions: Sandra Berkshire has been rescuing cats for 10 years and was trying to find them new homes

Overwhelmed: The animal shelter caring for the flea-infested cats has asked adopters to come forward

Ms Berkshire told NBC2: 'I did need help. I got it. But not the way I wanted it.'

'I'm not just sitting there hoarding them. I'm trying to find good homes.'

Many of the cats removed from the house were found to have respiratory infections and fleas, as well as signs of neglect.

The
 animal shelter they have been taken to has been overwhelmed by the 
number of cats it is now caring for and urged potential adopters or 
foster families to get in touch.

No
 charges have yet been filed against Ms Berkshire, and she has been 
given a couple of weeks to clean up her home. If she fails to clear it, 
she could face fines of up to $250 a day.
