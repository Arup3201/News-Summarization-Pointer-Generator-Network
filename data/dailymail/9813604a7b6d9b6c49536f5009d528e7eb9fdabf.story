Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said Labour's policy of grade inflation has allowed education chiefs to 'fool themselves' into thinking standards have improved

Labour's policy of allowing exam grades to rise despite poor educational standards was savaged by the chief inspector of schools yesterday.

Sir Michael Wilshaw said the education authorities had been ‘fooling ourselves’ for years that standards were improving because grades were going up.

In fact, the UK has fallen well behind other nations in terms of educational attainment - particularly Asian countries.

Sir Michael made the comments ahead of the launch of Ofsted’s annual report in which he revealed 1.75 million children were being let down by poor schools.

It provided yet another hammer blow to Labour’s education legacy following two major reports that revealed glaring gaps in English children’s schooling.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Grade inflation has taken place in our schools and the Secretary of State is dealing with the issue.

‘There is no question that grade inflation has been operating in our schools. We have been fooling ourselves.’ 

Andreas Schleicher, of the OECD, said in October that research showed young adults in Britain have more qualifications than their grandparents but not greater abilities.

This showed there had been grade inflation and that qualifications did not necessarily mean better skills.

Ofsted’s report warned 250,000 children are languishing in failing schools and another 1.5 million are stuck in primaries or secondaries rated as requiring improvement.

Sir Michael called on the government needed to re-introduce national curriculum tests for seven and 14-year-olds, saying it had been a ‘mistake’ for Labour to phase them out.

In a thinly veiled attack on teachers who complained of spending time on the tests, he said this had been done to pander to ‘vested interests’.

‘Talk to any good headteacher and they will tell you it was a mistake to abolish those tests. That’s because good teachers use those tests to make sure every child learns well,’ he said.

‘In getting rid of the tests we conceded too much ground to vested interests. Our education system should be run for the benefit of children and no one else.

‘If we are serious about raising our standards and catching up with the best in the world, we need to know how pupils are doing at seven, 11, 14 and 16.’ 

Children’s performance is already monitored at 11 with maths and reading tests, as well as one on spelling, punctuation and grammar, and at 16 in GCSEs. A reading test has also been introduced for six-year-olds.

Sir Michael said the tests should be marked externally as inspectors have found ‘worrying inconsistencies’ in teachers’ own assessments.

English and maths lessons were a particular problem, with a third of lessons rated less than good by inspectors between 2009 and 2013.

A greater emphasis was needed on spelling and handwriting in English and time should be devoted to allowing pupils to read for pleasure.

Maths questions were too simple and needed to be more demanding, with children taught not just how but why solutions were reached.

He also revealed inspectors will be sent into schools with no notice from January to stamp out ‘horseplay’ in the classroom and instil a respect for learning.

At present teachers are informed one day in advance, giving them the opportunity to remove disruptive pupils from classrooms or bribe them to keep quiet.

In future, complaints from parents or teachers will be enough to trigger a visit.

The report, based on 8,500 inspections from 2012 to 2013, described run-down schools where there is ‘litter in the playground and disorder in the corridors’, untidy classrooms, chewing gum on carpets and uniform policies that pupils routinely ‘flout’.

‘Around 700,000 pupils attend schools where behaviour needs to improve,’ he said.

‘Unless this changes, teachers will struggle to create an environment in which all children learn well.’ 

The report found a record eight out of ten schools were now rated good or outstanding.

But it said three factors were hindering progress - mediocre teaching and leadership which allows misbehaviour to flourish, regional differences in the quality of education and underachievement of poor children, particularly among white pupils.

It repeated his suggestion for a ‘national service’ of teachers and headteachers who can move into failing schools or areas for up to two years to turn them around.

Sir Michael said: ‘There are unmistakeable signs that England’s education system is gradually improving.

‘If our destination is the high peaks of a world-class education system and the economic benefits that follow, we are now in the foothills.’ 

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Ofsted is right to place a high premium on good behaviour.’
