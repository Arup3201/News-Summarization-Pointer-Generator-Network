It is the exclusive seaside enclave where the well-known rub shoulders with the well-heeled.

But the millionaire residents of Sandbanks are having their tranquil existence ruined by some unwelcome visitors.

The area has become an unlikely magnet for raucous stag and hen groups.

The exclusive Sandbanks area near Bournmeouth, Dorset is being plagued by hen and stag parties renting out houses on quiet residential streets

Multi-million pound properties in Sandbanks - the fourth most expensive area in the world - are being rented out to groups of up to 50 people for £1,000-a-night.

The problem has also spread to neighbouring Canford Cliffs and Branksome Park.

The groups are often bussed into the pubs and clubs of Bournemouth nearby, but return to the house parties in otherwise quiet residential streets late at night and cause havoc.

Conservative MP Robert Syms said the growing trend was making large sums for the owners of the homes but make life a misery for people living nearby.

In a debate in Parliament he read out a letter from a resident who claimed to have seen ‘prostitutes being delivered well into the night… loud bass music, taxis coming and going…’

Housemates have been seen playing football in gardens at 3am, throwing bottles over fences and climbing trees outside neighbouring properties, Mr Syms said.

‘We have to do something about this because it is making people’s lives a misery. People are fearful of a Friday afternoon. They pray for rain because people stay inside.

‘If you are a hen party you can rent a 
naked butler which is a concern when they are serving drinks on a hot 
afternoon in the garden.’

Ministers said councils and the police now have powers to close down party houses, like these in Poole, if they think will cause a disturbance

He said a father had returned home with his child to find ‘blow up dolls bought from a sex shop all the way around the veranda’.

‘Most of it is high spirits. Most of it is youngsters wanting to have some fun. In a residential area this is inappropriate.

‘This is a real problem for my constituents. This is ruining people’s lives. It is changing the nature of the area.

Tory MP Robert Syms said he feared angry residents would take the law into their own hands

‘I have heard stories of elderly people being barricaded into their homes because of the noise.’

One couple has bought a caravan which they go to stay in ‘to get a good night’s sleep’, Mr Syms added.

‘I fear that the anger of my constituents means they will take the law into their own hands. It is running people down and they are very angry indeed.’

The millionaires' playground of Sandbanks is only half a square mile of golden sand but is home to some of the most expensive properties in the country.

A modest bungalow sold for £1.5million, but when it was demolished and the plot put back on the market with planning permission it went for £3million.

QPR Harry Redknapp and ex-players Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp are among those who have bought homes there.

Furious residents insist the problem of house parties is not confined to Bournemouth and has spread from other cities including Bath and Brighton.

Jen Cameron told LBC radio: ‘People have responsible, stressful jobs and they want to use their home as a retreat.

‘It's not that we're offended by it, we all have celebrations, but if I can just give you some outline of the things that a lot of us are suffering: We've got screaming and shouting, kicking things over, emptying of hundreds of glass bottles into the recycling bin at goodness-knows-what-time, we've got drunk residents lighting barbecues against fences at 1.30 in the morning – and that might be a Tuesday.

‘We're having to get up for work. We're all working very hard like most of the country are at the moment. It's caused absolute misery for so many people.

Resident Jen Cameron

‘In fact, there is a previous resident who's been nearly suicidal with it. It's not that any of us object to hen and stag parties per se, but it's about inappropriate use of residential areas that are otherwise tranquil.’

Jen Cameron, 35, and husband Stephen, a 54 year old IT consultant, live next door to a large, modern detached house in Elmsted Road in Canford Cliffs.

Mrs Cameron said: 'We have seen naked butlers serving drinks to groups of women in the garden as well as strippers for the male groups.

'You get blown up phallic-shaped toys tied to railings outside which obviously isn't appropriate for a residential area.

'I have seen people sat on the veranda using a funnel to pour vodka down their throats and we have had barbecues started at 1.30am.'

Houses which can sleep up to 40 or 50 people are being rented out for more than £1,000-a-night, causing misery for people living nearby, Parliament was told

John Sprackling, the chairman of the Sandbanks and Branksome Park Residents Association, said: 'For the neighbours of these party houses the problem is very bad.

People are moving out of their homes at weekends just to avoid the noise, either that or they have taken to bunkering down in their homes.

'The culmination was a house in Elmsted 
Road in Canford Cliffs where Stella Artois bottles were thrown over a 
hedge and smashed the patio doors of the woman next door.

John Sprackling, residents association

'The parties normally start at 3am when the groups have come back from the clubs in Bournemouth but by that time the council environmental health staff have gone home.'

In the debate the Home Office minister Norman Baker said the problem was a ‘relatively new phenomenon’ which can affect communities ‘in quite profound ways’.

‘It is clear that the current system is fragmented, complex and inadequate.’

But under changes to anti-social behaviour laws councils and the police are to get new powers to close down properties if they have ‘reason to believe the use of a premises has caused a nuisance to the public, or could do’.

Deluxe Holiday Homes is responsible for renting out several of the party houses. Michelle King, a spokeswoman for the company, said: 'We deeply regret any inconvenience that may have been caused to residents in the Canford Cliffs area.

'We have consistently sought to prevent this by only renting to mature groups. We welcome hearing about any problems.'
