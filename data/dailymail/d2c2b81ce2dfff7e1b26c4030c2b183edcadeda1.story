Criticism: Sir Ian McKellen was unimpressed with John Key's behaviour

Actor Ian McKellen has hit out at New Zealand's prime minister after he made what has been construed to be a homophobic joke.

John Key teased a radio presenter on Friday by saying his red sweater was 'gay'.

He is a controversial figure and earlier in the same day he allegedly accused David Beckham of being 'thick as bat s***'.

When preparing for a golf challenge 
Key said to broadcaster Jamie Mackay: 'You're munted mate, you're never 
going to make it, you've got that gay red top on there.'

He made the reference because the colour of his party is blue.

Key was given a stern ticking off by 
McKellen in a blog post, who played Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings 
franchise filmed in New Zealand.

He wrote: 'I'm currently touring 
secondary schools in UK, attacking homophobia in the playground and 
discouraging kids from the careless use of 'gay' which might make their 
gay friends (and teachers) feel less about themselves.

'So even as he supports the proposal 
to introduce same-gender marriages in New Zealand, I do hope John Key 
listens to his critics and appreciates their concern. Careless talk 
damages lives.'

Key had defended his actions by saying he was working for and with the gay and lesbian community.

'If someone was offended by it then I apologize but it's not exactly like a term you don't hear everywhere,' he said.

'I voted for gay marriage, I'm hardly homophobic. I led the charge on it.'

He refused, however, to apologise for remarks he is supposed to have made about former England footballer Beckham.

Key was discussing a 2008 exhibition match between Mr Beckham's LA Galaxy and local side the Oceania All-Stars at the time.

He first described Beckham as handsome
and 'a really nice guy', before adding the offensive remark, according 
to Radio New Zealand.

When pressed about the claims, Key refused to confirm or deny what had been said.

'That is someone that thinks they have overheard a conversation I have had,' he said on breakfast television.

Thick? Key allegedly insulted David Beckham's intelligence

'I am not going to engage in that because otherwise I am engaging in every conversation that someone thinks I have.'

The presenter pushed the Prime Minister for an answer, adding: 'Can I just clarify that you are saying that you didn’t call David Beckham thick?'

Key replied: 'No, what I am saying is that somebody has overheard a personal conversation and that’s their recollection of it. I am just not going to engage in discussions about that. That’s their view.'

The Herald Sun, in Australia, reported that Key had come in for critcism about his 'embarassing' remarks.

One twitter user insultingly compared him to Sascha Baron Cohen's hapless fictional character Borat.
