David Cameron and George Osborne are set to break a promise to publish their tax returns before the election.

The Prime Minister had insisted he was 'relaxed' about the idea, insisting it was 'legitimate' for voters to ask if politicians paid the right tax.

Mr Osborne, who first floated the idea in the Cabinet, has now admitted there are 'no plans' for it to go ahead.

David Cameron had insisted he was 'relaxed' about the idea of publishing his tax returns but Chancellor George Osborne now says there are 'no plans' to do so.

Mr Cameron and other members of the coalition have faced intense pressure to say whether they benefited from a decision in the 2012 Budget to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p.

Two years ago Downing Street said senior Tories were willing to publish their tax returns, but stressed the election was a long way off.

Now, with four months until polling day, the plan has been shelved.

But last night Mr Osborne told the Sunday Times: 'There are genuine issues around taxpayer confidentiality and how it would work in practice.

'You see it as a feature of some American campaigns but I think there would be quite a lot of practical difficulties. There are no plans at this point. The income I receive is publicly declared.'

In 2012 Mr Cameron, who earns £142,500 a year, was said to be 'very happy' for the information to be released but the move would be unprecedented for a sitting prime minister.

In April 2013 government ministers in France began releasing details of their financial records in the wake of a tax fraud scandal involving a close ally of President Francois Hollande.

Aides to Mr Cameron insisted again that he remained 'relaxed' about the idea but were unable to give any information on progress made in putting his tax records into the public domain.

They insisted the idea had not been shelved, but there were still two years until the general election in May 2015.

Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats said in 2012 they would not be opposed to publishing tax details.

Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers' Alliance, told the paper: 'Politicians must keep their word if they are to be trusted, so having said they would publish their returns, those in the highest offices should do just that.'

Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: 'My view is that they should stick to what they said they would do.'
