A panda cub could be born in Britain for the first time within the next month.

Zookeepers have found signs that Tian Tian, the UK’s only female giant panda, may be pregnant.

Changes in her protein and hormone levels have been detected and her nesting behaviour has also changed.

Edinburgh Zoo said the signs were encouraging – but warned there is still a chance it could be a phantom pregnancy.

Ian Valentine, director of the zoo’s panda project, said: ‘It is possible Tian Tian could give birth in just two weeks.

‘The window we are looking at starts on August 24 but it looks like it may be towards the end of the month or later.’

The zoo artificially inseminated ten-year-old Tian Tian after she was reluctant to mate with her male companion Yang Guang.

'Moody': The team at the zoo have not been able to carry out an ultrasound, but if their suspicions prove correct Tian Tian could give birth to a cub as soon as next month

The pair arrived in Scotland in 2011 on a ten-year loan from China.

There was no way to be certain Tian Tian is pregnant because she has resisted an ultrasound scan.

She has been showing a lack of appetite and restlessness, and has made a bed of straw in apparent nesting behaviour but pandas are prone to pseudo pregnancies.

Mr Valentine said: ‘Confirming a female panda’s pregnancy is never straightforward and we would encourage people to try not to get too excited just yet.

‘The overall picture is looking quite good. We have to assume she will give birth not just to one but to twins. Quite often pandas  in captivity give birth to twins,  and she gave birth to twins the last time.’

If the pregnancy is confirmed, an expert from China will fly over before the birth. Sperm from a giant panda in Berlin, Bao Bao, was used in the attempt to inseminate Tian Tian.

However, only a blood test on the cub will determine whether he or Yang Guang is the father.

The cub, or cubs, would officially be the property of China and be sent there after two years.

The panda pair have been a popular attraction, with visits from around 500,000 people in their first year

Tian Tian and Yang Guang will stay in Edinburgh for a decade. Any child will be sent to China after two years

Giant pandas are native to the mountain forests of Chinese provinces Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu.

Estimates suggest only between 1,000 and 2,000 giant pandas remain in the wild.

Tian Tian and Yang Guang are the first to live in the UK for 17 years. They are staying at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade.

The zoo grows about 15% of the bamboo needed to feed the giant pandas. The rest is imported from Amsterdam.

Yang Guang goes through 55kg of bamboo a day and Tian Tian around 30kg.

Female pandas ovulate once a year, giving a window of just 36 hours in which they can get pregnant.

Normal breeding season for pandas is from mid-April to May.

Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April using semen from Yang Guang and frozen semen from Bao Bao, a 'genetically important' panda which died in Berlin Zoo last year.

Gestation period is typically five months and the panda will give birth to one or two cubs.

Panda cubs are born blind, hairless and unable to move, making them dependent on their mother for survival.

After six to eight weeks, cubs open their eyes for the first time. They feed on their mother's milk for the first year and start eating bamboo at around six months.
