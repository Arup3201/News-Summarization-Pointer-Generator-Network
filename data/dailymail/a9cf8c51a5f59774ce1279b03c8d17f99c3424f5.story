Former Barcelona striker David Villa and ex-Everton midfielder Tim Cahill showed that rivals can still be friends in New York on Thursday.

Villa has recently joined New York City FC while Cahill is a star for New York Red Bulls, but the pair seemed to get on when they met for the launch of the new MLS logo.

The new branding is to mark the 20th season of America's domestic league, which was launched as part of the USA's bid to host the 1994 World Cup.

New York City, a partnership between Manchester City and the New York Yankees, will be playing for the first time next season.

Alongside Villa they have also signed Chelsea's all-time record goal scorer Frank Lampard, who is currently on loan at Manchester City. 

The 19th MLS season is currently ongoing, with New York Red Bulls on course to make the end of season play-offs.
