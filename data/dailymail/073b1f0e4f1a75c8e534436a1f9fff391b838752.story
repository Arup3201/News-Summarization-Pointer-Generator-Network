Disciplinarian: Sir Michael Wilshaw

HEAD teachers have threatened to pass a vote of no confidence in England’s chief inspector of schools amid claims of ‘bullyboy tactics’.

The country’s biggest heads’ union accused the traditionalist leader of Ofsted of creating a ‘climate of fear’ in schools with ‘negative rhetoric’.

The National Association of Head Teachers urged Sir Michael Wilshaw to rethink proposals for beefing up the school inspection system and to drop his ‘confrontational’ approach.

Delegates at the union’s annual conference agreed a motion that ‘does not rule out a vote of no confidence in the future’ – effectively a call for his resignation.

They also vowed to collect 100,000 signatures for a petition on Downing Street’s website to force a Commons debate on changes to the inspection regime.

The row plunges relations between Ofsted and the teaching profession to their lowest point since ex-chief Chris Woodhead declared 15,000 incompetent teachers should be sacked in 1995.

Heads are angry at a series of reforms proposed by Sir Michael, a former headmaster who recently turned round a failing comprehensive by imposing a strict discipline policy, since he became chief inspector of schools in January.

These include a three-strikes-and-you’re-out policy which would involve giving an automatic failing verdict to any school achieving a ‘satisfactory’ grading at three inspections in a row.

In addition, all ‘satisfactory’ schools would be rebadged as ‘requiring improvement’.

Sir Michael has suggested 5,000 head teachers should fall into this category.

A further proposal to remove the current 
48 hours’ notice of an inspection has already been dropped, with 
Education Secretary Michael Gove admitting it implied a lack of trust.

Delegates at the NAHT’s Harrogate conference went on the offensive over Sir Michael’s regime.

Mike Curtis, head of Carterton Primary in Oxfordshire, declared: ‘Can we really put our trust in Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector? I suggest not.

‘We must stand up to the bullyboy tactics of Michael Wilshaw. We need to send a strong message to say we’ve had enough. We deplore his negative rhetoric, which is demoralising our members and creating a climate of fear in schools.

‘The time has come for action. Schools are not factories. We deal in people.’

Delegates initially put forward a motion calling for an immediate vote of no confidence in the chief inspector.

After debate, they decided it amounted to the same  kind of bullying they were criticising.

Members voted 98.9 per cent in favour of a new motion calling for a petition and a Parliamentary debate, which allows for the possibility of a no-confidence vote in future.

During his career as a head, Sir Michael earned a reputation as a strict disciplinarian.

He is best-known for transforming the fortunes of Mossbourne Academy in Hackney, East London, with tough discipline.

A spokesman for Sir Michael said: ‘Ofsted has been listening to the views of head teachers, teachers and parents about its proposed changes to school inspections and will announce the results of its consultation at the end of the month.’
