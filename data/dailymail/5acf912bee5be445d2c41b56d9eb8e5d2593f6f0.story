The first time a child says 'Mummy' or 'Daddy' is the most cherished moment for any parent.

I remember my children saying it, or even better, attempting to say it. More wonderful still, perhaps, if that's possible, is the first time a child says 'my Mummy' or 'my Daddy'. My mother remembers that moment to this day.

After having my sister, but then suffering a series of miscarriages, she and Dad adopted me a few days after I was born.

They felt that at last their family was complete with me, and as Mum always said, it just seemed as if it was meant to be. Mum is no reader of runes or tea leaves, she's one of the most rational human beings I've ever met, but I know exactly what she means. It's the magic of adoption.

So why don't more people do it? In my new series, Wanted: A Family Of My Own, we were able to go behind the scenes and expose some of the myths and preconceptions about adoption. In each of the four episodes we look at two adoptions and meet the adoptive parents and the children being adopted.

For the first time, I got a real glimpse of what my parents must have felt all those years ago. The assessment process, which has been much publicised, is rigorous and rightly so, but the joy at the end result is matchless.

My mum's 90 now and in rude health. When she adopted me, times were very different and adoption was of another age.

Back then there were around 20,000 babies adopted every year in Britain who had mostly been given up at birth.

Today it's around 4,000 children, only about 50 of whom are babies, because back then very young or unmarried mothers were driven to give their babies away by the attitudes of society and all too often the shame of the family.

The children needing loving families today are usually older than in the past, and have been taken by the authorities from troubled families as youngsters. Many have a history of abuse or neglect, but some things will never change: children still need a family in 2014, just as they did in 1962. A loving, caring family just like mine.

This new series is ground-breaking for ITV. It took more than two and a half years to make because of the process itself and the unique partnerships we had to form with eight local authorities.

In the first episode we meet Dan and Ania. Like my mum, Ania went through the torment of miscarriages. Dan had two children from a previous marriage, but they were desperate to complete their family so they set off on the adoption road.

I saw the raw emotion, the desperate yearning - when people want parenthood this much it's all they can think about. When we see their happiness as they finally manage to adopt their little boy ten months later, you know they're going to be the most amazing parents.

I get exasperated with some of the thoughtless and occasionally downright ignorant terminology people use.

'What was it like when you met your real mum?' they'll ask. But my adoptive mum is my real mum: she isn't my birth mum, but she is my real mum.

Yes, I did all the birth-tracing malarkey and it was fascinating, bewitching and at times utterly bewildering. Although it led to me meeting so many of my relatives including my half-sister Esther, ultimately, after coming out of the other side of a very peculiar tunnel, my sense of belonging to my adoptive family felt even stronger.

I wasn't being disloyal, I was just completing the jigsaw puzzle, and Mum and Dad gave me all their loving support. That's what mums and dads do, isn't it? The modern approach is very different though.

Today there is no erasing of the past. Heritage is hugely respected now and that really is for the better because the more knowledge a child has of their beginnings, the less of a burning, life-consuming issue it will become in the future.

Of course, it's never forced on a child or young person to trace their parents, but there are no secrets and contact is always an option if appropriate.

A few years back I was lucky enough to be chosen for the brilliant BBC1 programme Who Do You Think You Are? The subject was my dad - my adoptive dad, my real dad. He died in 1996, hours after I had held his hand and kissed him goodbye.

As fulfilling and intriguing as the journey into my brand new past and quest for my 'birth' families had been, and whatever maelstrom of feelings it all stirred up, finding out about Dad - his family history, his amazing war record, all the things that made the man who really made me - was so much more emotional than the search for my own biological roots had been. Love transcends biology. Belonging transcends beginnings.

When I presented my very first radio show on a local station in Aberdeen back in 1982, Dad and Mum drove 150 miles to sit in their car outside and listen intently to every cheesy link to every appalling 80s record I played.

I may be doing them a disservice, but I don't really think Spandau Ballet was entirely their cup of tea. Mum still has loads of copies of the Wheel Of Fortune game show I fronted in the late 80s on video cassette. Embarrassing doesn't cover it.

I've had the most amazing mum and dad, and you could be a mummy or a daddy too. You can be over 40, gay or straight, single, divorced or cohabiting, already have children, live in rented accommodation, be unemployed, have a low income or a disability - and still adopt.

While I was making this series I didn't meet any prospective parents who thought the process was unnecessarily drawn out or intrusive. No more so than a pregnancy anyway!

Hopefully, Wanted: A Family Of My Own will show the many thousands of potential adopters out there (and boy are they needed) that the process is accessible, far easier than they thought and perhaps far more wonderful than they ever imagined.

I hope, in fact I know, that some amazing potential parents will learn more about the modern reality. I believe they will see the process demystified, myths dispelled and then one day soon some beautiful little person will look up at them and say 'Mummy' or 'Daddy'. That is the true magic of adoption.

Wanted: A Family Of My Own airs on 24 April at 9pm on ITV.
