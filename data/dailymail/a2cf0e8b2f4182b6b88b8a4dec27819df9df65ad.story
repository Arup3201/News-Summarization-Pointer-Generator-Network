The powerful magnitude 6.0 earthquake that rocked California wine country early on Sunday morning woke up almost half of Nearby San Francisco and Oakland residents.

Experts studied data from thousands of fitness bands that also track sleep. 

They found that even in San Francisco and Oakland, slightly more than half (55%) woke up.

The Northern California Seismic System reported Sunday that there is a 54 percent chance of another earthquake of magnitude 5.0 or higher within the next seven days.

Along with the warning comes the likelihood of as many 70 aftershocks, reports the Sacramento Bee, that could remind Northern California over the next week that they live in an active fault zone. 

The USGS estimated that based on their locations, 15,000 people experienced severe shaking, 106,000 people felt very strong shaking, 176,000 felt strong shaking and 738,000 felt moderate shaking. 

Researchers at Jawbone released the data from users of its popular fitness tracker. 

'Our data science team wanted to quantify its effect on sleep by looking at the data recorded by UP wearers in the Bay Area who track their sleep pattern,' Eugene Mandel of the firm said.

'Napa, Sonoma, Vallejo, and Fairfield were less than 15 miles from the epicenter. 

'Almost all (93%) of the UP wearers in these cities suddenly woke up at 3:20AM when the quake struck. Farther from the epicenter, the impact was weaker and more people slept through the shaking. 

'In San Francisco and Oakland, slightly more than half (55%) woke up. As we look even farther, the effect becomes progressively weaker — almost no UP wearers in Modesto and Santa Cruz (and others between 75 and 100 miles from the epicenter) were woken up by the earthquake, according to UP data.'

The data also revealed that, possibly unsurprisingly, many struggled to get back to sleep.

'Once awaken, it took the residents a long time to go back to sleep, especially in the areas that felt the shaking the strongest.

'In fact, 45% of UP wearers less than 15 miles from the epicenter stayed up the rest of the night.' 

With the immediate dangers like gas-fueled fueled fires and toppling roofs now behind them, residents of Napa and surrounding Bay Area communities have begun to assess the damages, which the New York Times reports could reach $1 billion.

Meanwhile, there could be more damages to come as experts warn that the next week could bring dozens of aftershocks, some of them nearly as powerful or even just as strong as Sunday's tremor.

Reports had already come in Sunday afternoon of small aftershocks, which while not damaging served as uneasy reminders of the danger that had passed only hours before.

The 30-second earthquake struck just before 3:30am between the towns of American Canyon and Napa in the heart of the state's famous wine country, Leslie Gordon of the U.S. Geological Survey said.

It's the largest earthquake to shake the Bay Area since the deadly 6.9 magnitude Loma Prieta quake in 1989, the USGS said.

The USGS estimated that based on their locations, 15,000 people experienced severe shaking, 106,000 people felt very strong shaking, 176,000 felt strong shaking and 738,000 felt moderate shaking.
