A former Army officer who once blamed his twin brother for a string of sexual assaults on young girls in Colorado has been sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.

Aaron Lucas, 32, was sentenced Friday in an El Paso court. He had been assigned to Fort Carson outside Colorado Springs.

He said last year his twin was responsible the attacks but in November he changed his mind, dropping the 'evil twin' defense and pleading guilty.

Authorities say the twin, Brian Lucas, denied involvement, but in a bizarre twist, he has since been charged with sodomy and first-degree abuse of a child in Alabama, reports WHNT.

Brian Lucas was arrested in Huntsville in late January.

He is being held at Madison County jail and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on March 12.

Investigators say DNA linked Aaron Lucas to the abduction of an eight-year-old girl in Colorado Springs and to cases in Alabama and Texas.

Prosecutors dropped some of the Colorado charges and Lucas agreed to not fight extradition to Texas for a 2009 case. Alabama authorities agreed not to pursue charges for another case.

During sentencing, parents of the victims gave impact statements, asking the judge to give the military man the maximum sentence for what he did to their children.

'I don't know what to do 
with her, seeing her and seeing the way she is," said the 
Spanish-speaking parent of one young victims, who spoke to the judge by 
phone. A translator interpreted her tearful testimony, reports the Colorado Springs 
Gazette.

'We will never be alright again,' she said.

Two
 more parents, a mother and father both in the armed forces, told the 
judge that their six-year-old daughter had been taught to trust people 
in uniform, and that Lucas had preyed on that trust.

During the attack, Lucas was wearing his Army uniform.

'Our
 daughter was taught to trust the uniform,' the mother said, reports the
 Gazette. 'She went to that uniform when he approached her.'

The
 parents of the Lucas twins also spoke at the sentencing hearing, 
telling the judge that Aaron Lucas had also been subjected to sex abuse 
as a child and that the stress of combat in Afghanistan had resulted in 
his actions.

'I'm brokenhearted that he's been fighting this demon,' said his mother, Marsha Lucas, reports the Gazette.

Aaron 
Lucas, who is married with two children, was arrested last year in 
connection with a child abduction and an attempted child abduction over 
the summer.

But detectives realized the 32-year-old matched the description of a suspect in as many as 11 attempted abductions.

DNA
 taken from an attempted abduction in Colorado matched samples taken 
from crime scenes in Alabama in 2007 and Texas two years later.

His
 lawyers were given permission by a district court judge to pursue the 
claim the DNA was from his twin brother Brian, who lived in both states 
at the time of the attacks.

But the attorney's office maintained that there was no evidence to back up that claim.

Aaron Lucas' attorneys also claimed that an unidentified third man is responsible for the Colorado assaults.

But the army officer will serve 20 years to life for the assaults after his legal team reached a plea agreement with prosecutors which was approved by a judge.

The Colorado Springs Gazette has 
quoted Lucas' lawyer as saying that the mistaken identity claim was a 
'legal, tactical decision'.

He added: 'He loves his family. He doesn't want to create problems for them.'

El
 Paso County prosecutors had said that the Colorado victims' ages ranged
 from six to nine and that they were targeted at random in Colorado 
Springs and nearby Fountain by a man who tried to coax them into sex 
with promises of money and ice cream.

Stationed: The crimes began shortly after Aaron Lucas' arrival at Fort Carson with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division

Lucas pleaded guilty to nine cases of sexual assault on children.

The incidents began shortly after Aaron Lucas' arrival at Fort Carson with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.

A
 Colorado Springs police detective, Fred Walker, has testified the 
assaults stopped while Aaron Lucas was deployed to Afghanistan.

Lucas received 
the Bronze Star, the fourth-highest honor given to members of the 
military, for valor during a deployment to Afghanistan.

In his four years of active duty, Lucas amassed a glowing military resume including 10 medals and awards.
