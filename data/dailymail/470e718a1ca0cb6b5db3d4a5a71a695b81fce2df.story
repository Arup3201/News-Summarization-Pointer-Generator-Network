Former soldier Richard Monteith was upset after being told to turn down the collar of his shirt because the Union Jack design was 'offensive

A former soldier who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan claims he was turned away from a pub in Scotland because workers said the union flag on his top was offensive.

Richard Monteith was told he would not be served again in the Black Bull pub in Polmont, Falkirk, unless he turned down the collar of his Hackett Boat Race polo shirt, which exposed a Union Jack , because it was seen as offensive.

The 36-year-old served 17 years with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and lost several friends and colleagues during tours of the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Kosovo. 

He said he was upset with the reaction because he had been in the army and had to deal with seeing a lot of friends draped in the flag after dying in service.  

The incident took place last Friday. Mr Monteith said: 'I had a couple of sips of my pint and was told unless I turned my collar down I wouldn't be served again.

'I asked why and they said the Union Jack and red, white and blue colours were offensive.

'When I asked why the woman just laughed and said 'because it is'.

'I just don't see how the flag or even the colours could be so offensive to anybody.

'To say red, white and blue are offensive is laughable. It was really silly comments, to be honest.'

Mr Monteith, now a security consultant, added: 'Being in the army I have carried quite a few friends that are draped in these colours so I find it very offensive.

'I wear it with pride for them, nothing else. It was me who was shocked and deeply offended.' 

Mr Monteith served for 17 years with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, working in Iraq and Afghanistan

The 36-year-old was told he would not be served again unless he turned down his collar, so he left the pub

Mr Monteith refused to react to the statement or turn down his collar and left the pub. 

They walked into one across the road and no issues were raised.  

The father-of-two said he had been unable to get a full explanation from the Black Bull since the incident, despite leaving messages for the manager.

A spokesman for the pub said: 'We are carrying out an investigation into the allegation, but cannot comment further until we speak to all of the members of staff who were working on Friday evening.'

The soldier said he was upset at the reaction from bar staff because a number of his friends died on duty 

Mr Monteith has previously completed tours of the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Kosovo 

Mr Monteith said he has carried a number of soldier colleagues draped in the Union flag and was offended
