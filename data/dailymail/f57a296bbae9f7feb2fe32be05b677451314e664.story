James Bond’s favourite car-maker Aston Martin celebrated its centenary today – exactly 100 years to the day after it was founded.

The British luxury sports car company marked the landmark anniversary with a special ceremony outside the firm’s original home in London where a commemorative plaque was put up.

The car firm,  which gave British agent 007 his licence to drive one of the world’s most desirable cars, also put on show the oldest surviving Aston Martin - an A3 – and  one of its latest – a new Centenary edition Vanquish – outside the company's first headquarters in Chelsea, south-west London.

The new DBS model starred in the James Bond film Casino Royale and showed how the Aston Martin had remained popular with fans

Where it all began: The original Aston Martin Coal Scuttle, produced in 1915 when the company was founded

Wheel-y good! The Aston Martin's second prototype of the 'Coal Scuttle' from 1920 won many admirers for its design

In Aston Martin's first 90 years the company built fewer than 15,000 cars. This is the smooth-looking DB4 from 1961

Aston Martin was founded 100 years ago today by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford. Their  company Bamford & Martin later became Aston Martin, acknowledging Bamford's success at the Aston Clinton Hillclimb in Buckinghamshire, where he had successfully raced their very first cars.

The centenary ceremony took place at 16 Henniker Mews, off Callow Street, Brompton, London, SW3 6BL where Bamford and Martin, which later went on to become Aston Martin Ltd was incorporated on  15 January 1913.

Among those taking part were Aston Martin chairman David Richards and Roger Carey, chairman of the Aston Martin Heritage Trust (AMHT) as well as the firm’s  directors and leading members of the Aston Martin Owners Club.

The anniversary also comes at a fitting time for Bond fans as 007 picks up screen honours and is short-listed for a number of Oscars.

Star of the screen: 007 actor Sean Connery made the car iconic in the spy films

Boy racer: Carroll Shelby in Aston Martin DBR1, winner of the 1959 Le Mans 24 hour race

Iconic: The 1964 Aston Martin DB5 Superleggera. The cars became a firm favourite with Bond

The classic 1964 car from Goldfinger: The Aston Martin DB5 became a star of the screen in its own right

In the original Ian Fleming books, Bond is  associated more with a super-charged Bentley.

But in his first screen outings in 1960s movies such as Goldfinger and Thunderball with Sean Connery in the driving seat he was put into the now iconic Aston Martin DB5, complete with machine guns and ejector seat.

He has since been reunited with the DB5, most recently with Daniel Craig in the driving seat in the latest movie Skyfall, which picked up a Golden Globe award for its theme tune co-written and sung by Adele.

In Aston Martin's first 90 years the company built fewer than 15,000 cars.

But in the past decade it has built more than 45,000.

The very first Aston Martin, named ‘Coal Scuttle’ was built in 1915.

The firm hopes to take on rivals like Porsche and Ferrari in the future. Pictured is the Aston Martin DB9

Moving with the times: The Rapide was Aston's first-ever modern four-door, which had a 6.0-liter V-12 engine

Following Coal Scuttle and the Great War, three more prototype cars were built including Bunny -no longer in existence - and chassis number A3 built in 1921 which was the third Aston Martin ever built,  the oldest in existence, and the car on display today.

It is owned by the Aston Martin Heritage Trust which is co-hosting with the company a major centenary diner tonight at London’s Hilton Hotel in Park Lane.

Aston Martin is also having a  week-long centenary celebration festival at its headquarters in  Gaydon, Warwickshire, until July 21 as well as major event in London featuring up to 1,000 Aston Martins, and a Bond-themed centenary drive  taking in locations used in a variety of Bond movies.

Although the iconic Aston Martin DB5 has been a firm favourite of 007 since the 1960s, the firm’s current line up comprises the Vantage family of V8, V8 S, V12 Vantage and V12 Zagato, the Cygnet city car, new DB9, Rapide four-door sports car and new super GT – the Vanquish.

The strictly limited edition One-77 supercar is now sold out.

Last month Aston Martin announced a £150million cash injection from a new shareholder to 'accelerate' plans for sexy new vehicles worthy of 007.

The new partner is European investment group Investindustrial which is taking a 37.5 per cent stake in its business.

As a result of the deal Aston Martin said it planned to invest £500million in new models and technology over the next five years.

The cash lifeline to the luxury manufacturer based at Gaydon in Warwickshire will allow it to 'proceed with its extensive and exciting plans for sustainable long-term growth' and take on rivals like Porsche and Ferrari.

Kuwaiti groups Investment Dar and Adeem Investment Co  bought Aston Martin five years ago for around £500million from  US car giant Ford which controlled the brand from 1987.

Aston Martin  has 146 dealerships across 41 countries and employs 1,600 people.

A priority for the new cash will be a new model to replace the DB9 model, it said.
