A driver accused of shooting dead a father-of-two in an apparent road rage incident last month has been denied bond by a judge who said he could be a danger to the public.

Martin Zale, 69, was ordered to remain in Livingston County Jail, Michigan after prosecutors said the incident is similar to another road rage incident in 2008 when Zale punched a driver in the face.

He is now accused of shooting Derek Flemming, 43, in the head on September 2. According to Mr Flemming's wife, he had approached Zale to complain about his erratic driving.

But on Tuesday, as Zale appeared in court, his family called him a 'devoted and loving' man who had 'every right to stand his ground' in a statement on their website - the Martin Zale Defense Fund.  

In court: Martin Zale, 69, appeared in court in Livingston County, Michigan on Tuesday but was denied bond. He allegedly gunned down a father-of-two during an argument about his driving last month

They said they could not detail why Zale was arguing self defense but that truth would be revealed in court.

'We stand united and strongly believe that when all of the facts of this case are disclosed to an impartial jury, the law will prevail and Marty will be judged fairly for his right to self-defense,' it said. 'The record will be set straight regarding the devastating events of that day.'

The statement called him 'a faithful, devoted and loving husband to his wife of 25 years', a father of two sons and a man who has 'high regard and respect for the law'.

The family is also accepting donations for his defense on the website.

In a previous description, it says that he 'was attacked in a space where he had a right to be. He had no duty to retreat, and had every right to stand his ground.'

It adds that he is 'being unjustly charged with open murder ... for defending his life.'

'Loving': Before he appeared in court, his family released a statement saying he was a loving and caring man

Who is he? Zale, pictured left in his mug shot and right in a family handout, is a respected for his 'conservative moral family values', his family said. Prosecutors pointed out that he also punched a man in 2008

Zale has also been charged with discharging a pistol from a vehicle and two counts of possessing a pistol in the commission of the murder and the firing of the pistol. 

He could face up to life in prison if convicted.

In the altercation on September 2, Flemming got out of his vehicle and approached his pickup. Zale then rolled down his window and shot the man, prosecutors have said.   

Before the incident, both men were involved in separate incidents involving road-rage or threats, the judge heard on Tuesday, Mlive reported.

In November 2008, Zale punched a man outside a McDonald's after the man pulled in front of him while turning onto a road, according to a police report.

In a statement at the time, Zale said he regretted the incident and was glad that the driver wasn't hurt. The police report was read out in court on Tuesday.  

Killed: Derek Flemming, pictured right with his wife, was shot in the head after approaching Zale last month

Heartbroken: Amy Flemming ran over and begged her husband to live after watching him drop to the ground 

Assistant Livingston County Prosecutor Daniel Rose said that every driver has incidents that spark anger - but Zale acts on those feelings. 

He noted the two incidents were similar, but Zale's attorney, Melissa Pearce, said that the court would soon learn that this case was very different.

But the judge agreed with the prosecution that releasing Zale was not safe. He will be back in court on November 21. 

In his own incident, Flemming allegedly threatened to shoot Enbridge Energy workers or 'anyone' who came on his property, according to police reports in 2012.

In September, he and his wife Amy were driving along Grand River Avenue to pick up their children after the first day back at school when they ran into Zale in his 2012 Dodge pickup. 

Zale was speeding so fast that Mrs Flemming thought he was going to hit them, she said.

He then allegedly tailgated the couple, then as they tried to pull to the right to let him pass, he passed them in the right lane, forcing them to jerk back into the left. He pulled in front and then slammed on his brakes, she said. 

Scene: Zale pulled the trigger from inside his truck in broad daylight in front of numerous witnesses

Missed: Flemming had been on his way to collect his children when he was shot dead by the stranger

When both cars pulled up at a set of traffic lights on Grand River at Chilson, Derek Flemming got out of his vehicle and approached Zale's window.

A loud argument ensued but it doesn't appear there was any physical contact between the men. Zale then lowered his window and shot Flemming once in the face. 

Speaking to Detroit Free Press, the victim's widow recalled how Zale appeared emotionless after gunning down her husband. 

She told the newspaper her husband walked up and asked the other driver: 'What's your problem?'

'And it was a second or maybe two after Derek said that to when there was a gunshot,' Flemming said. 'As soon as I heard the gunshot and I saw him fall, I was getting out of the car and running to him.'
