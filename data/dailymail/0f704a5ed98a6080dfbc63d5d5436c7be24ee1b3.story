Roberto Firmino announced himself on the international scene earlier in the week as his 25-yard strike earned Brazil a 2-1 victory over Austria.

His first goal for his country was quite a hit, and as well as making an impact for Brazil he has established himself as one of the stars of the Bundesliga.

But how much do you know about one-time Liverpool target Firmino? Here, Sportsmail tells you some more…

Where does he come from?

The 23-year-old was born in Maceio, the capital of coastal state Algagoas. Firmino grew up supporting Corinthians and idolising former Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldinho. The attacking midfielder started playing football at his local academy, Clube de Regatas Brasil, before he moved to Tombenese in 2008 as an 18-year-old.

How did his career develop?

He was loaned to second-tier Figueirense in 2010 and it was here he made his name, scoring seven goals and earning himself the player of the season award in his first campaign as a full professional. This caught the eye of many European clubs, including (reportedly) Liverpool. However it was German side Hoffenheim who acted the fastest, signing Firmino for £3.5million in January 2011 after he originally joined in December 2010.

Born: 2 October 1991, Maceio, Brazil

Age: 23

Hero: Ronaldinho 

Clubs: 

(2009-10) Figueirense - 38 apps, 8 goals

(2011-) 1899 Hoffenheim - 118 apps, 34 goals

Honours: ESPN Brazil's Young Brazilian Overseas Player of the Year 2014

How did he find it in Germany?

He struggled in his first year at Hoffenheim. He was dropped in November 2011 for turning up late for training. However after re-gaining his place he went on to score seven goals in 26 appearances.

Firmino is now regarded as a fans’ favourite, making 127 appearances and scoring 42 times. Last season he hit 22 goals in all competitions. But, more impressively, finished fourth top scorer in the Bundesliga and second in the assist standings.

Did they take any notice back at home?

After what many regard as a breakthrough season in 2013-14, Brazilian journalists began to call for Firmino’s inclusion in the international set up. They voted him Young Brazilian Overseas Player of the Year on ESPN Brazil, as he beat the likes of Chelsea’s Oscar and PSG’s Lucas Moura to the award.

After another impressive start to the season, scoring five goals in 11 games, he was included in the national squad for international friendlies against Turkey and Austria. Having made his debut against Turkey, he then scored that goal against the Austrians.

How far can he go?

The Bundesliga is one of the strongest leagues in world football and at 23 the playmaker is already recognised as one of the biggest talents the German game has to offer.

The sad reality for Hoffenheim fans is the sense of inevitability surrounding the future of Firmino – a goalscoring midfielder who prefers the No 10 role - as one would assume his performances are not going unnoticed by the giants of European football.

Firmino is a more traditional, skilful Brazilian attacking midfielder who likes to shoot from range (as shown by his first international goal) and if he is able to maintain his current form there is no doubt he will go on to become a regular for his country.
