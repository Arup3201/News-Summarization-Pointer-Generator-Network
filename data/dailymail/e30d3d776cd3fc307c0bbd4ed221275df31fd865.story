There has been divided opinion over whether Paris Jackson is innocent victim or precocious teenager in the current custody battle surrounding her and two brothers Prince and Blanket.

However, a former nanny has defended the 14-year-old saying she is simply 'spirited and dramatic'.

Paris, already in the media spotlight as the only daughter of late Michael Jackson, catapulted further into headline territory after grandmother Katherine Jackson was stripped of her 
guardianship.

Concerned for their happiness: Former Michael Jackson nanny Grace Rwaramba has defended his daughter Paris' outbursts on Twitter, saying she is a 'spirited, very expressive and dramatic young girl'

Outspoken Paris was rather vocal on Twitter when grandmother Katherine Jackson went 'missing'

Now Grace Rwaramba asks requested that the public be kind to Paris, telling Radar: 'She is a spirited, very expressive and 
dramatic young girl.

'The traits that made her the apple of her father's 
eye are the same traits that she must learn to control as she matures 
into adulthood. Let's be careful not to dim her spirit.

'It breaks my 
heart to think that Paris and her brothers could become the subject of 
endless criticism for simply being kids. Michael loved his children very
much.

'He gave them tools that they will need to become good and decent 
individuals.

'I am confident that in time, Paris and her brothers will 
learn that their family loves and wants what's best for them.'

Grace, who began working for the Thriller star in 1997, also stressed that having 700,000 followers on Twitter is unconventional for any teenager and people should grant Paris room to make mistakes.

The social networking site provided a
canvas for Paris to ink her fury when Katherine went 'missing' and was 
uncontactable for 10 days.

It later transpired that the 82-year-old 
was in fact at a spa in Tucson, Arizona.

Grace
continued: 'Everyone knows that Michael went to great lengths to 
protect his children...

'While the use of veils and masks was 
unconventional, it only highlights how important this issue was to him.

'The
recent drama surrounding Michael's mother, Katherine, the ongoing 
custody issues and now the public dispute between Paris and Janet is 
exactly what Michael wanted to protect his children from.'Â 

It
has now been reported that a new custody agreement for the trio is 
expected to be signed off by The Supremes songbird Diana Ross.

Michael named the 68-year-old 
legend as a back-up guardian in his will after Katherine.

The new agreement will see shared custody of the children with grandson Tito Joe 'TJ' Jackson.

In hindsight, it seems Paris is rather mature for her age though, tweeting: 'sometimes i need my alone time... this world is so crazy and unpredictable i just need some time to think, relax, and breath.'

Victims? Blanket, Paris and Prince are now said to be in the custody of Diana Ross and Tito 'TJ' Jackson

Meanwhile, TMZ has clarified a report published last week, which claimed Janet Jackson slapped and verbally abused Paris.

The website had claimed the singer got into a fight with her niece and grabbed her phone, calling her a 'spoilt little b****' during an argument at the Jackson Calabasas compound.

But TMZ has now issued a correction, posting: 'Although we believed the story to be true when we published it, we have 
now determined it was not correct ... Janet did not slap or otherwise 
touch Paris, nor did she verbally abuse her.'
