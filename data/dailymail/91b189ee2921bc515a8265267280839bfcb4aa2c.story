Starting at the top of the formation (and the talent), getting the best out of England’s best player, Wayne Rooney, could be a critical part of a successful tournament.

Rooney is a centre-forward who thrives in that position and I don’t see why there is even a debate on this. He should be in that No 9 role, up front and centre, and allowed to play to his strengths.

The keeper and back four effectively select themselves, not least because the centre-half pairing of Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka have become something like established, with a decent understanding.

Main man: Wayne Rooney is England's best player and needs to play up front to get the best from hi strengths

Anfield connection: Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson will prove a shield to protect the defence

The obvious and ideal defensive midfielder, Michael Carrick, wasn’t selected. So Stevie Gerrard and Jordan Henderson should make up the two-man shield that adds protection to the back four.

That leaves a line of three for a trio of young, swashbuckling, attack-minded players, and if fit and available then, right to left, I’d choose Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Flyer: Danny Welbeck

Power: Daniel Sturridge

Saints alive: Adam Lallana

Fingers crossed: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would get the nod over Lallana if he recovers from injury in time

They’re all mobile and would interchange positions. If the Ox doesn’t make it, then Adam Lallana comes in.

Jack Wilshere has had too many injuries for me to start although he could play himself into a starting place. Lallana can fit into that three, as can Ross Barkley, who I’d use as a cameo impact sub initially.

Frank Lampard offers cover in the shield. Rickie Lambert is England’s ‘secret weapon’: many opponents won’t know him well, and he offers excellence from the penalty spot. He’s living the dream, delighted to be there — and good luck to him.
