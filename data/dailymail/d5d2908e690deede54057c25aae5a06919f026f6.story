A marine veteran, 61, put his life at risk on Sunday night after he tried to catch a woman who threw herself off the third deck of the Oakland Coliseum, critically injuring them both.

The shocking incident happened at around 4:30 p.m. following the Oakland Raiders game against the Tennessee Titans.

The Alameda County Sheriff's Office says the woman, who appeared to be in her twenties, intentionally jumped about 45 feet from the third deck at a section which was closed to the public.

The 61-year-old was leaving the coliseum with a friend, walking along the concourse below when he saw the woman on the stand.

He pleaded with her not to jump but she threw herself off the seating area anyway, injuring them both when she landed on him.

A lifelong Raiders fan, he had just recently purchased season tickets after following the team on TV for years, according to CNN.

Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt J.D. Nelson said: 'He put himself in a lot of risk. And, right now, he is in the hospital paying the price for it. 100 per cent he saved her life.'

The woman was in the intensive care unit on Monday morning after a serious blow to the head. The Marine vet's injuries are not life-threatening.

Neither of them have been identified.

Nelson also said they believe the woman threw herself off the deck in a suicide bid.

He told KTVU-TV that the woman went to an area that is closed off to the public and leaped off the edge as people below urged her not to jump.

'She jumped anyhow, and one guy tried to catch her,' Nelson said.

Nelson said the unidentified woman was taken to the hospital in 'very critical' condition, and the man was in stable condition.

The Raiders lost 23-19 to the Tennessee Titans in the final seconds of the game.

Earlier on Sunday, a man fell down 14 steps and hit his head at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, during the Ravens-Jets game.

According to Captain Demy of the Baltimore Fire Deparment, the 48-year-old man was taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center and was reported to have life-threatening injuries.

The cause behind the man's fall is under investigation.
