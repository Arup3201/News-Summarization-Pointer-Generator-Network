'Wonderful son': Freddie Perry, 10, died after he was hit by a car in Didcot, Oxfordshire, on Tuesday

The family of a 10-year-old boy who died after he was hit by a car have paid tribute to their 'lovely son'.

Freddie Perry suffered a serious head injury after he was hit by a black Nissan Micra in Oxford Crescent, Didcot, Oxfordshire, early on Tuesday evening.

The car was being driven by a female teacher at Didcot Girls' School, where one of Freddie's older sisters started a week ago, it emerged today.

The schoolboy was taken by ambulance to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where he died as a result of his injuries on Wednesday.

His parents Lea and Judith Perry said in a statement released through police: 'Freddie John Perry was our lovely son.

'He was taken from us far too early.

'He was a wonderful son and a fantastic younger brother to Rhiannon, 14, who has Down’s syndrome and he doted on her, and to Eloise, 11.

'He will be very sadly missed by all. Rest in peace.'

Initial reports suggested the Year Six pupil at the Stephen Freeman Community Primary School in Didcot may have run in front of the car, leaving the motorist unable to avoid a collision.

One neighbour said Freddie had been playing with a group of friends on a patch of grass beside the road before he ran out between two large parked vans.

The teacher behind the wheel had just left work at the girls' school which is opposite the Perrys' smart red-brick terraced house.

She said: 'It wasn't the woman's fault - she didn't have a chance to see him or react.'

'The woman had only just left work and she would not have had time to get any real speed up.  This is just a really quiet road.'

Another resident said: 'Freddie was a lovely little boy, always racing around with his friends on their bikes. He had this gorgeous cheeky smile that I'm sure just lit up the room.'

A large number of teddy bears, flowers, balloons and drawings have been left at the side of the road where the schoolboy died.

One friend wrote: 'I miss you. Thank you for teaching me basket ball. Olivia', while another note signed by Jack said: 'I will always remember you Freddie, best friends forever.'

Freddie's classmates were told of the
tragedy yesterday, and the headmistress Ruth Bennie said: 'We are 
devastated - everybody who knew Freddie loved Freddie.

'He is going to leave a big, Freddie-shaped hole in the school community.  Our thoughts are with his family and friends.'

Rachael Warwick, headteacher at 
Didcot Girls' School, said: 'As a school, we are shocked and saddened by
news of this tragic incident.

'Our thoughts and very best wishes are with Freddie's family at such a difficult and painful time.

'Our understanding is that this was a terrible accident and now we need to allow the police investigation to take its course.

Freddie's friends and neighbours left flowers, toys, balloons and drawings near where he was hit by the car

Instructors
at the CP Defence kickboxing and self-defence school where Freddie had 
trained for a year said it had been 'a pleasure' to teach the young boy.

Craig Pinder said: 'He was a shy student, always well-behaved, hard-working and with great character. 

'He will be missed by many.'

A
Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Police are urging anyone who was 
in the area or who may have seen this incident and has not yet contacted
them to get in touch.'
