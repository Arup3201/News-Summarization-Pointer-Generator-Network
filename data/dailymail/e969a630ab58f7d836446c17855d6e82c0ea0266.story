A British jihadi flew out of Britain to fight for Islamic State (IS), despite being stopped by airport police who knew he was suspected of planning to join the terror group in Syria.

Extremist Omar Hussain told The Mail on Sunday how he caught a flight from Gatwick to Istanbul, despite being arrested by counter-terrorism officers and questioned about his travel to Turkey.

The story of how Hussain, a former Morrisons supermarket security guard, left Britain under the noses of police officers came in an extraordinary ‘interview’ with The Mail on Sunday – conducted via Facebook – in which he revealed he was injured in a gunfight in Syria.

Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, was detained at Gatwick because six months earlier he had tried to fly from Heathrow to Pakistan, but was stopped by detectives suspicious he would then fly on to Syria to ‘take part in terrorist activity’.

During the Heathrow arrest in June 2013, Hussain’s house was raided and his British passport confiscated for three months.

But astonishingly, in late December, he was allowed by police to board a flight to Istanbul, even though Turkey was already a well-trodden route used by British jihadis to reach Syria.

His account came as security chiefs and the Government are planning stricter legislation to prevent would-be terrorists leaving the country for groups such as IS.

Hussain’s revelation was described as ‘shocking’ by former Government anti-terror advisor Lord Carlile, who called for a full inquiry into the details.

Boasting that he had twice given British police the slip, Hussain displayed contempt for anti-terror officers last week, adding: ‘Just shows how easily deceived these police can b. I bet the 2 police who stopped me and questioned me r getting sacked. Lol.’

Lib Dem peer Lord Carlile said: ‘It is actually shocking that somebody who was stopped previously and prevented from travelling was able to travel to Turkey unimpeded a few months later, and is now shown to be, beyond any doubt, involved in violent Islamist Jihad.

‘This is the sort of case I would hope would be looked into by the Home Affairs select committee in order that some deep digging can be done to find out what’s gone wrong.

‘It is absolutely clear to anyone who has any real experience in airport security that much more joined-up working is needed.’

Hussain also sent The Mail on Sunday a collection of photographs which showed him in Syria, posing with children toting AK-47 assault rifles. Another showed him with a bandaged arm, taken, he said, after he had been injured in a gun battle with the more moderate Free Syrian Army forces, also fighting the Assad regime.

Last month, we exposed Hussain’s real identity after he gave an interview under a false name on BBC’s Newsnight, in which he said: ‘The only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.’

He refused to disclose where in Syria he was, but the location setting on his Facebook account showed him in Al-Bab, near Aleppo, an area under partial IS control.

Hussain , who is British-Pakistani, issued a chilling warning that if the UK joined bombing campaigns with the US, there would be terror attacks within mainland Britain.

He said: ‘I cannot say for certain what the consequences will be. However, no doubt the UK will be prone to attack from within.’

Hussain gloated over how he gave police the slip en route to Syria by flying from Gatwick to Istanbul 

The jihadi also revealed how he or fellow British terrorists can return to the UK from Syria to launch attacks without being caught by the authorities. He said: ‘There are many loopholes in your system. What’s preventing me from going to India or Pakistan and coming back to the UK with someone else’s passport through a student visa? There are many ways I can return.’

When asked if British jihadis have already returned to the UK to launch attacks, he said ominously: ‘All I can say is no comment. There are certain things I cannot say.’

David Cameron has said that returning jihadis pose the ‘greatest and deepest’ security threat facing Britain today, but plans to deal with them are still unclear and no firm commitment has yet been made to new legislation to bar their return.

Last month, the terror threat level was raised from ‘substantial’ to ‘severe’, meaning an attack is highly likely.

He formerly worked at a Morrisons supermarket but refused to comment on whether British jihadis had returned to launch attacks 

As Hussain gave his interview over the course of last week, British Muslim leaders condemned an IS video showing the beheading of Scottish aid worker David Haines by a masked man with a London accent, dubbed Jihadi John.

In the same video, Jihadi John showed captive taxi driver Alan Henning, 47, from Eccles, Manchester, whom he threatened to behead.

Hussain said he supported the killing as it has been sanctioned by IS scholars, saying: ‘As for beheading Alan Henning, then I trust the scholars of IS in their judgment.’

Neither the Metropolitan Police nor Sussex Police would comment on Hussain’s claims.

l About 66,000 refugees, mainly Syrian Kurds, have crossed into Turkey in just 24 hours, Turkish deputy prime minister Numan Kurtulmus revealed yesterday. Turkey opened its border on Friday to Syrians fleeing the Kurdish town of Kobane, where an attack by IS is feared to be imminent.
