Justin Bieber's latest outing to a club ended in a bloody brawl on Saturday night.

The 'Beauty and a Beat' singer allegedly 'went nuts' at a fellow reveller as he partied at hotspot South Pointe, in ritzy New York resort the Hamptons, leading to a physical altercation between members of the star's entourage and club patrons.

The fight is thought to have been 
triggered by a heated exchange between Justin, 19, and a male club-goer 
after a female friend attempted to hit on the singer in his roped-off 
V.I.P. section.

A source told the New York Daily News: 'He ripped his shirt off and went nuts. He was screaming.'

Justin's security team quickly intervened and took the star out to the club's car park to cool off, but according to TMZ things flared up 
again. 

Justin - who was by then sitting in his SUV - allegedly jumped through the sunroof onto 
the hood of the car.  At that point it's unclear what happened, but the alleged 
victim was knocked out on the cement.

Police confirmed to TMZ Justin's entourage went after the clubgoer, after he had become aggressive with them.

A spokesman for Bieber confirmed to MailOnline: 'Justin was not involved in any altercation.'

Bieber's entourage are now under investigation after a nightclub patron was left sprawled out in the parking lot and taken to a hospital.

An investigation is underway after the
alleged victim filed a police report.  Justin will not be the target of
the investigation.

Earlier in the evening, the 
'Boyfriend' hitmaker's bodyguards were accused of being 'heavy-handed' 
with fans who had hoped to meet the star.

Justin arrived with his entourage and four bodyguards at around 2am and quickly 'took over' the V.I.P. area, which was closely guarded by his eagle-eyed minders.

The security team were described as being 'intimidating' and 'overbearing', and even flashed a torch in the face of partygoers who tried to snap pictures of Justin on their cameraphones.

It comes after a string of incidents where Bieber demonstrated 'pop brat' behaviour'.

He has been pictured spitting on fans and urinating in a janitor's mop bucket in the kitchen of a New York night club.

Even the star's mother struggles to justify some of his behaviour.

'I'm not naive to think that my child is 
perfect and making all the best decisions of his life,' said Pattie 
Mallette, who is only 38-years-old herself.

While appearing on the Bravo show, Watch What Happens Live, Mallette went on to say: 'He knows what I disagree with and he knows all the things that I'm really proud of him for, too.

'I
mean, people don't talk about all the great things he does every day,' 
she told host Andy Cohen when appearing with another celebrity parent, 
Kris Jenner.

'Every night before a show, he meets 
with Make-a-Wish kids. He goes to sick kids' hospitals. He visits with 
them (and) takes his time. He gives back to charities.'
