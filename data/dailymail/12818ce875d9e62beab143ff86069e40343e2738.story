An expat travelled 7,000 miles back to the Isle of Wight to attend a school reunion only to miss the party after turning up at the wrong venue.

Steve Ashcroft jetted in from his home in the Philippines for his 'Class of 1978' get-together, arranged by former pupils of Carisbrooke High School.

But after flying for 15 hours, shipbuilder Steve, 51, ended up at an 18th birthday party after a friend mistakenly told him to go to Newport Football Club instead of Newport Social Club.

Steve said: 'I managed to successfully navigate to the Island from more than halfway around the world but I couldn't find the right place to go in Newport.

'If I'd made it, it would've been my first school reunion in 35 years. By the time I found out where it was being held, it was too late, which was a disappointment.'

Organiser Pam Gustar was in the same class as Steve, who moved to the Philippines nearly 20 years ago.

She said: 'I can't believe what happened - what a disappointment for him and for us. I have heard he was going to come and was trying to book a flight but then heard nothing else and assumed he wasn't coming.

'I didn't think anything of it until the next day there was a call from the partner of the guy who he had come with asking where the reunion was because they had turned up at a party at a football club. You couldn't make it up.'

Pam is hoping to get hold of Steve's number so they can meet before he flies back to the Far East.

'It would be a bit if a wasted journey if he isn't able to catch up with anyone,' she added.
