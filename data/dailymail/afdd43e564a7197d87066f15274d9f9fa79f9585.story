Credentials: Oxford-educated Patrick Rock, 62, comes from a noble background. He is pictured here in 1984 during the Portsmouth South by-election

Born Patrick Robert John Rock de Besombes to a family of European aristocrats, he has worked for leading Tories for four decades.

But despite his impeccable social and political contacts, Oxford-educated Rock has repeatedly failed in his ambition to become a Conservative MP, despite being selected to fight safe seats.

Rock, 62 and unmarried, lives in a £500,000 flat in Parsons Green, West London. He was born in Kensington in 1951, a year after the marriage of his mother Gertrud and Egyptian-born father Robert John Rock de Besombes.

His paternal grandmother was a D'aigneaux, from a noble French family that originated in Normandy and boasts a coat of arms.

As
 a teenager, Rock boarded at the elite Jesuit Stonyhurst College in 
Lancashire, winning a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, where he
 studied history.

After 
graduation he worked as Margaret Thatcher's political correspondence 
secretary in the then Prime Minister's Office and also as managing 
director of the Retail Consortium.

It
 is not clear when he shortened his name to plain Patrick Rock, but he 
used it while fighting the Woolwich East election in 1979, aged 28, 
which he lost despite increasing the Tory vote.

After losing Crewe and Nantwich in the 1983 election he was selected in a by-election to defend the seemingly impregnable safe seat of Portsmouth South in 1984, which had a Tory majority of over 12,000.

The Portsmouth News described him as 'Mrs Thatcher's protege' who had been hand-picked by Downing Street to contest the seat ahead of more impressive local candidates.

During the campaign he was described as 'likeable and energetic but slightly wet behind the ears'. His campaign went catastrophically wrong after he spoke on TV about a hospital that was not in the constituency.

Rock was unconcerned, declaring at a public meeting that he was 'absolutely certain' he would win the seat, predicting Labour would finish second and the Liberal SDP Alliance trail in third.

But after a 14 per cent swing against him, he was defeated by the Alliance's Mike Hancock in what was labelled the 'biggest election upset for years' and a 'great surprise' to Mrs Thatcher.

Newspaper reports described the defeated Rock leaving the count 'pale with shock'.

He blamed the defeat on too many Conservatives staying at home and Mrs Thatcher phoned him the following morning to assure him the defeat was not his fault.

The following year, he was appointed to the Conservative Research Department.

He later worked as special adviser to Cabinet ministers in the Department of the Environment and then the Home Office, where he met David Cameron.

The pair are famously said to have repaired to the Two Chairmen pub on the day of the death in 1994 of Labour leader John Smith, where they agreed Tony Blair would take over, leaving their party 'f*****'.

Rock again attempted to become an MP in 1990, applying for the safe Tory seat of Devizes, but failed to be selected.

He also worked in Brussels for EU Commissioner Chris Patten, with the responsibility for the western Balkans, before becoming a policy adviser at Downing Street.

Colleagues describe him as 'abrasive' and 'a commentator rather an a doer'. Another said his arrest over child abuse images was a 'terrific shock'.
