A vaccine against deadly meningitis B was yesterday approved by experts – but may not be available on the NHS before the end of the year.

Until then, families will have to go private for the jab, the first to prevent the form of meningitis which kills hundreds annually – with half the deaths among under-5s.

The European Commission has found the vaccine – called Bexsero – safe and effective for infants aged two months and over and older children.

The vaccine is the first to prevent the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis in the UK, which is expected to dramatically cut the toll of death and disability among children

But it will not become immediately available on the NHS.

The Government’s advisory committee on
 vaccination has not decided whether the jab will become part of the 
NHS routine immunisation programme.

Health campaigners fear it could take until the summer or even until the end of the year for a ruling.

Meningitis UK Founder Steve Dayman, 
who lost his 14-month-old son Spencer to meningitis and septicaemia in 
1982, said: ‘This ground-breaking vaccine is the most important 
development since I lost my son to meningitis 30 years ago.

‘The Government must introduce the 
vaccine into the immunisation schedule as soon as possible – it will 
save thousands of lives and spare families so much suffering. Any delay 
means lives will be lost.’

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and
 Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the Government, must first recommend
 Bexsero and decide which age groups should receive it.

It is likely to be given as routine 
jabs for babies from age two months in three doses, with a booster at 
one year, plus an initial catch-up programme for toddlers and teenagers 
aged 15-18.

The JCVI will consider factors such as price, 
cost-effectiveness and compatibility with other vaccines.

Meningoccocal B (pictured) is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in this country and one of the most deadly. It poses the toughest challenge for scientists because there are so many strains to target

The committee has discussed the 
vaccine before, but there is no deadline set for agreement. It took five
 years for the last major jab against meningitis – the pneumococcal 
vaccine – to be introduced into the immunisation schedule.

A mother who lost her 10-month old son wants the new vaccine to be approved by the NHS as soon as possible.

Kadyn Busby died on Christmas Day 2011 just hours after contracting meningitis B and septicaemia.

The baby boy seemed his usual happy self on the morning of Christmas Eve, but hours later he became lethargic and sick.

Parents Nikki and Tony took him straight to A&E, where 40 minutes later he developed a rash all over his body.

At 2.20am on Christmas Day, doctors delivered the devastating news that Kadyn could not be saved.

The Busbys, of Neyland, Pembrokeshire, support the Beat it Now campaign by Meningitis UK for the jab to be introduced on the NHS.

Mrs Busby, 29, said: ‘Meningitis absolutely shattered our lives within hours.

‘There’s no need for debate. The Government  needs to act. No parents should have to go through our ordeal.

‘It’s important that the vaccine is brought in as soon as possible. It’s the difference between life and death.’

Bexsero will be available privately in
 the ‘middle of the year’ when supplies are released by makers Novartis.
 No price has been set.

A meningitis C jab costs the NHS £7.50, which 
may be indicative of the new jab’s price.

Meningitis B is the most common form 
of bacterial meningitis in Britain and one of the most deadly.

There are
 1,870 cases on average each year, resulting in up to 200 deaths – with 
half the fatalities in those aged under five.

Up to 400 children are left with major life-long complications such as limb amputations, blindness, deafness and brain damage.

Although vaccination programmes have 
been introduced to combat pneumococcal meningitis and the strains C and 
Hib, no B vaccine currently exists in this country.

In trials in Europe involving 7,500 
children, adolescents and adults, Bexsero produced antibodies against at
 least 73 per cent of 1,000 meningitis B strains found.

Sue Davie of the Meningitis Trust said
 EU approval was a ‘significant milestone in the fight against 
meningitis’ but urged a swift decision by UK authorities.

She said: ‘It’s wonderful news that 
this new vaccine has been licensed, but licensing alone will not save 
lives.

'That will only happen when the JCVI recommends the vaccine is 
introduced into the Childhood Immunisation Programme, and the Government
 agrees and implements this recommendation.

‘With vaccines being the only way to protect against bacterial meningitis, the sooner this happens the better.’

A Department of Health spokesman said:
 ‘Meningitis is a worry for many parents so we’re pleased that a 
meningococcal B vaccine has now been licensed.

‘Our independent group of vaccination
 experts, the JCVI, is looking at the use of this vaccine and will 
provide advice in due course.'
