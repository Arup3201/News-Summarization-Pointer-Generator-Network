He has made a name for himself bedding tourists in Bali, now it looks as though Australia's self-proclaimed sex addict Todd Gisondi is looking to turn his sex life into a money spinner.

The man, who critics are giving a spray back home for ruining Australia's reputation abroad, is taking his self-proclaimed sexual exploits one step further in a move likely to outrage Aussies even more.

The mother of the Bali-based expat, who stars in reality TV series What Happens In Bali, has waged into her son's controversial and unemployed lifestyle by convincing the 25-year-old to work the corners of Kuta's party district as a gigolo - searching for tourists 'looking for a companion whilst in the land of gods.'

Sex addict: Tod Gisondi is on the path to becoming a gigolo courtesy of an advertisement from his mother which sells him as 'Anthony, Athletic and well built'

The former rugby league player and Newcastle resident is now living a life of leisure on the tourist circuit in Bali's Kuta district

Already copping blasts back home for lines such as 'girls feed off anything I say', this latest stunt will shock viewers as the man who considers himself 'a f***ing handsome devil' goes to air on Channel 7 tonight.

Gisondi, 25, is originally from Newcastle but up and fled to Bali after splitting with his long-time girlfriend. He says he has slept with more than 100 women since making the move four months ago, and on the program claims to never come home from a night out without a woman.

'I'm 100 per cent gonna go home with someone,' he says. It is claims such as this which has lead his mother to convince him to work as a pimp, and Gisondi wants to charge his clients up to $100 an hour for his services.

Referring to himself on the program in the third person, Gisondi says: 'Mum's a bit worried about precious Toddy.' So, she's like 'you know you're sleeping with all these girls, how about you start getting paid for it Toddy?.'

The job description paints him as an part Australian, part Italian stallion whom ladies looking for a good time would be hard pressed to refuse. 'Ladies in need of a companion whilst in the land of gods, I'm an Australian with Italian origin, 25-years-old now living in Bali,' it reads.

It is the solution, his mother claims, to keeping him out of trouble and preventing him from getting girls pregnant.

The 25-year-old checks himself into a sex clinic, a prerequisite required of  gigolo's to ensure they have a clean bill of health

The ad goes on to describe Gisondi, best known for picking up women using his dog Tito and for acts constituting sex with two or more women at one time, as 'athletic, tanned, well built, well educated and well spoken.'

It advises that 'all areas of discretion are assured' for women wishing to sleep with 'Anthony,' the pimp pseudonym his mother chose. Those he perceives fortunate enough to sleep with him  will pay just $100 an hour for his company.

'Mate, I'm gonna have to pop some Viagra to pump out an hour,' he says.

It's a sure fire way to russle some of the feathers of the Australian public who haven't taken well to Gisondi's overseas antics.

'Disgusting television. Todd is vial and his attitude to women is appalling,' Ellie Thomas wrote on the program's Facebook page. 'Obviously there are no female producers because any self respecting woman would not let this trash air.'

Meanwhile Kevin Stewart wrote: 'It seemed to be an interesting show, right up to the point you introduced Todd, then it became "A W**ker in Bali" and it got that way I stopped watching it.'

Kylie Atkinson said: 'He was such a tool, I couldn't stand him. Why did they devote so much time to this idiot? This is not a documentary!!'

And they're also unlikely to be charmed by his visit to a Bali sex clinic - describing to the doctor his sexual activities when asked how many times he has used a condom. 'None. Maybe once, but I took it off,' he says.

Asked if he ever questions his partners about their own sexual history he says 'I usually have sex with them and leave. I don’t really talk to them after it. I’m just like `see you later’.

But his mother has vowed to defend her son against any criticism. 'Ha ha omg that was good lol you look so cute son ha ha yeh yr copping it on the shows site, I will get my gloves on for u xxx love you,' she wrote on Facebook after the first program aired.

'Full support to the prince of poppies lol… yeh love his guts lol funny as all fark.'

There are two main ways he trawls for women – walking up and down the beach with his dog Titto or going out drinking in Poppies Lane in the party district of Kuta.

The rugby player - who only targets tourists, never locals or expats - uses his dog to break the ice, and has a very specific system for scoring girls. He gets a 'cat conversion' if he succeeds in taking a girl home before midnight.

He gets a 'double double' if he gets a cat conversion and then goes out and finds another girl to take home.

But apart from his self-proclaimed sexual expertise, the Australian expat also counts rapping as among his aspiring talents. He goes by the name of The Prince when he's performing on stage.
