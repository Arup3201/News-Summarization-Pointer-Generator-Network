Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence 
Booth's view of day four of the third Test between England and India at 
the Ageas Bowl, which Moeen Ali inspired an England their first Test victory for a year.

England's attack, unsurprisingly, has been held together by opening bowlers Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, who have claimed nearly half of the wickets taken since their last victory one year ago.

Top man: James Anderson has taken 47 of England's 184 wickets since their last Test win

The pair have taken 90 of the 184 wickets to fall. Anderson has 47 at an average of 29, Broad 43 at 31.

Next, a long way back, is Ben Stokes, with 22 wickets at 32, followed by the surprise package of Moeen Ali, with 18 at 32, and Liam Plunkett, 18 at 34. 

DROUGHT WAS TEST OF PATIENCE

England’s first Test win in 353 days has been a miserable sequence encompassing four series, 10 Tests and seven defeats.

The drought extends back to the fourth Test against Australia at Chester-le-Street, which finished on August 12, 2013. The five survivors from that game are Alastair Cook, Joe Root, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson.

ENGLAND’S LONG LIST OF LOSERS

England have picked 25 players in the 11 Tests since their previous win, but 10 of them have played no more than two matches each.

Down and out: Monty Panesar is one of several players who has only played two Tests since England's last win

Jonny Bairstow, Tim Bresnan, Monty Panesar, Jonathan Trott and Chris Woakes played two Tests; Scott Borthwick, Jos Buttler, Simon Kerrigan, Boyd Rankin and Chris Tremlett one.

Anderson, Bell, Broad and Cook are the only ever-presents.

UNWANTED RECORD AVOIDED

Had England failed to beat India in Southampton, it would have been their longest winless streak since they went 18 Tests without success from January 1987 until August 1988.

NO ORDINARY JOE

The leading performers with the bat during the drought have been Joe Root , with 822 runs at an average of 51, and Gary Ballance, with 628 at 62.

MVP: Joe Root (L), being congratulated by Alistair Campbell, has scored the most runs during England's drought

Between them, the Yorkshire pair have scored five of the nine centuries compiled by England batsmen during the winless streak.

INDIA’S BIG STRUGGLE TO LAND TWO IN A ROW

The result, following on from India’s victory at Lord’s, backed up the tourists’ habit of rarely stringing together impressive performances away from home.

The last time they won two in a row in the same series outside India against a team other than Bangladesh or Zimbabwe was in 1986, when they beat England at Lord’s and Headingley.

Inconsistent: India have not managed two consecutive Test wins against a decent side since 1986
