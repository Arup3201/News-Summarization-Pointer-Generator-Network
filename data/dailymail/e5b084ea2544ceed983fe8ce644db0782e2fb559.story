A retired company director shot his wife and dog before turning the gun on himself after admitting to having an affair.

Donald Knight, 78, and his wife Mary, 77, were found dead at their £500,000 luxury farmhouse by daughter Sarah on May 1 last year.

Mr Knight confessed to his GP that he had been seeing another woman while his wife visited the hairdresser.

Donald Knight shot his wife, Mary, on her birthday before killing the family dog and then shooting himself

The couple were found dead at their £500,000 luxury home in picturesque Loddington, Northamptonshire

He
 shot his wife on her birthday, before shooting dead the couple’s pet 
dachshund, Daisy, in the garden of their family home in picturesque 
Loddington, Northamptonshire.

Using
 a shotgun, he then shot himself in the face and bled to death from 
‘catastrophic injuries’ on the patio of the house they had built 
together ten years earlier. Mrs Knight was found slumped in her chair in
 the lounge, with four gunshot wounds, including two to the side of her 
head.

An inquest in 
Northampton was told that in the weeks before the tragedy the father of 
two had visited his GP and admitted to having an extramarital 
relationship. Dr Joanne Marie Warcaba, who was also a family friend, 
said Mr Knight, former boss of a freight company set up by his family, 
confessed to seeing another woman while his wife visited the hairdresser
 on Fridays.

The inquest into the deaths was held at Northampton General Hospital

He said he 
ended the affair after two weeks and it is not known whether he had told
 his wife. ‘Mr Knight was clinically depressed and I prescribed him 
anti-depressants to deal with this feeling,’ said Dr Warcaba.

The
 hearing was told that Mr Knight was also struggling to cope with 
running the farm at the family property and confessed he had 
contemplated suicide.

The 
couple’s youngest daughter, Sarah Knight, told how despite her father 
being financially well-off he was convinced he was running out of money 
and wanted to downsize properties.

She
 said her father – who was his wife’s full-time carer – had also 
convinced himself he had cancer despite being in good health. Miss 
Knight, 48, who lived in an annex at her parents’ farm, said her 
mother’s health had deteriorated after she underwent an operation to put
 a stent in her heart.

Police were called when the couple's daughter, Sarah, found Mary Knight slumped in her chair in the lounge

‘She had gained a lot of weight and needed to do regular exercise but could not move around without help,’ she said.

‘My
 father was worried about the finances but he could afford to do 
whatever they wanted. He had convinced himself they were running out of 
money.

‘He had mood swings and he got old very quickly. He was worried that the farm was too big and wanted to downsize to a bungalow.’

A friend told the inquest she believed the tragedy was a suicide pact in a ‘final act of love’ so the Knights could be together.

Christine
 Percival, 64, who knew the couple for more than 20 years, said Mr 
Knight talked to her and her husband Peter, 73, about feeling suicidal.

Mrs
 Percival said Mrs Knight had overheard this and joked: ‘If it does get 
too much then you should shoot me first and then yourself.’

Knight was the former chairman at Kettering haulage firm Knights of Old and retired about 16 years ago

Asked
 what she thought when she heard the couple had been shot she added: ‘I 
wondered if it was a suicide pact. This would have been a final act of 
love so they would be together.’

Northamptonshire
 Coroner Anne Pember recorded a verdict that Mrs Knight had been 
unlawfully killed while Mr Knight had killed himself.

‘I
 believe when Mr Knight was feeling low and depressed,’ she said. ‘Not 
only did he take his own life, he made a decision that his wife, of whom
 he was the main carer, should die as well on her birthday.

‘At a time in his life when Donald Knight was feeling low, he did not wish to live.’

Mr
 Knight’s family ran an international distribution company that was set 
up by one of his ancestors, William Knight, in 1865. He was described by
 people in the village where he lived as a ‘pillar of the community’.

The
 couple had another daughter, Susan, 53. In a statement released shortly
 after the deaths, their family said: ‘We are devastated by this tragic 
news and wish to thank people for their kind words.

‘Donald
 and Mary loved each other’s company. They were lovely parents and 
grandparents whose passing is a massive loss to our lives.’
