An abandoned public toilet is set to be transformed into a three-bedroom house after a developer snapped it up for £80,000.

The toilet block in Ventnor on the Isle of Wight has stood empty since March 2011 when it was closed to the public.

But now the building looks set for a new lease of life after council planners on the island agreed that a new floor could be added to turn the block into a family home.

This abandoned public toilet on the Isle of Wight is set to be transformed into a three-bedroom house after a developer snapped it up for £80,000

The new first floor of the town centre property will have room for two bedrooms, an open plan kitchen and a sitting room

The men's and women's blocks, plus mobility toilets and cleaner's room will be torn out and replaced with a bedroom, store room, shower room and utility room.

And the new first floor of the town centre property will have room for two bedrooms, an open plan kitchen and a sitting room.

Permission to add a first floor extension to the property in the seaside resort and change its usage was granted last week.

The closure of the toilets, which were deemed surplus to requirements in March 2011, sparked an angry reaction with a 333-signature petition being presented to Isle of Wight Council council.

Planning permission had previously been granted to demolish the existing buildings and to replace it with a two storey block of four flats. 

The toilet block, seen on a floor plan in its current state, was bought by a developer last year

Council planners had recommended that consent be given for the changes to the 1990s-built block, and said the proposed house would not look out of keeping with other buildings in the area.

The council had agreed to sell the freehold interest in the site for £80,000 in September last year.

The block will not be the first to be converted into a home.

Last March it was revealed that builder Nick Willan had spent £189,000 to transform a Victorian toilet block in Sheringham, Norfolk into a two-storey holiday home complete with two en-suite bedrooms.  

And in 2010 couple Tracy Woodhouse and Graham Peck turned a seafront WC in Scarborough into a cosy one-bedroom bolt hole.
