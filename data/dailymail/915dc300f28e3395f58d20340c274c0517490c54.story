A punk whose dramatic 'make under' was one of the most memorable to feature on BBC show Snog, Marry, Avoid has returned to her previous look - and is now planning her punk-themed wedding to her bodybuilder boyfriend.

With her pink mohawk, pierced cheeks and leather outfits, Mel Wildman, 21, was one of the more extreme dressers to appear on the show.

The tattooed woman was given a dramatic 'make under' - where she was stripped of her bold make up, studded outfits and numerous piercings.

And the effect was stunning. Taken out of
 her favourite leather jacket, the 
artist from Morecambe, Lancashire, went from 'intimidating' to being flooded with 
offers of marriage.

From a punk to a lady: Mel Wildman was one of the more memorable individuals to appear on the BBC show Snog, Marry, Avoid - and was completely transformed for her 'make under'

Ms Wildman was originally happy with her more conventional look, saying she felt 'like a lady'

Ms Wildman, an artist from Morecambe, decided her new look was not for her - saying she felt uncomfortable and felt as though she  'looked like her mother' in her more conventional dress

Ms Wildman looked phenomenal in a red dress, long curly-haired wig and subtle make up for the show, filmed in February 2013.

The look was so dramatic that - a year later - her transformation is still a viral hit on the internet.

A clip of the show on YouTube has gained over 1million hits - and has recently been picked up by a number of beauty bloggers.

But despite saying she 'loved' the look when it was revealed on the show, Ms Wildman confirmed today she had returned to her previous punky style - saying she felt more comfortable as she was.

Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'I just thought it was more comfortable. I didn't feel comfortable or myself on the show.

'I liked the look, but I felt like I looked like my mother. I really liked the dress but I just felt so uncomfortable.' 

Ms Wildman, who has been with her partner Andy Bell (pictured) for 12 months, is now planning her wedding to the body builder - and says she wants to match her mohawk with her bridesmaids's dresses

The 21-year-old, pictured recently, said today she does occasionally wear the wig featured in the show when she wants to be a bit more girly

Writing online, she added: 'It is true that the tv 
adds 10lbs! Haha! I kept my old look. Wasn't that extreme to begin 
with!! Just had to bang extra makeup on for it since its telly :)'

Ms Wildman said she does still wear the curly-haired wig when she wants to look 'a bit more girly.'

'Sometimes
 I do want to be a bit more girly so I wear the wig and tone it down. I 
keep my piercings in though - I just forget they are there now.'

Ms Wildman lives with her bodybuilder partner Andy Bell, 47, in the small Lancashire town.

Although the two are not engaged, the artist says the two will marry - and she's already planning her wedding.

'I
 won't wear my leather jacket, no,' she said, 'I will wear a dress. But I
 will probably match my mohawk to my bridesmaid's dresses. Maybe they'd 
be pink.'

The 21-year-old says her partner of a
 year Mr Bell 'loves her just the way she is' and has no preference for what she wears.

She added: 'Andy knows everyone in Morecambe. I think everyone knows who we are now as we do look a little bit different.'

On the show, Ms Wildman spoke about her extreme look - and said she 'couldn't care less what people think'.

This was despite the fact that her own
 mother Jill said: 'People look at her as if she's scum. It just makes 
me feel ashamed, sometimes.'

But
 today Ms Wildman revealed her look, which she has been wearing for about
 six years, was an 'armour' she adopted because she was bullied at 
school.

The
 artist described how she had a 'miserable' childhood where she was 
bullied throughout primary and secondary education as a shy young woman.

She said: 'I was always that little geek at the back of the classroom, always getting bullied. Must have been an easy target.

'I
 was once beaten up for dropping a pencil on the floor. I was just 
picked on. All the way through primary and secondary school.

Mel loved her unique look but her parents were worried that people were judging her 'intimidating' look

The young woman, from Morecambe, said she had never worn clothing similar to the red lacy dress

'I think I started dressing like this as a sort of armour.'

Before
 her make-under she said she was frightened of being
stripped of her 'fakery' - saying she couldn't remember a time when she 
wasn't dressed in such an extreme fashion.

But
 the results were a pleasant surprise to her. Although she 
initially said she felt 'naked'  without her piercings, she gasped 'oh 
my God!' when she saw the results.

She thanked the team who gave her the new look, saying: 'I've never seen myself like this before.

'It's like someone else in the mirror. I feel like a lady and feel like I look sexy.'

With
 her new look, 70 per cent said they would snog her, while the remaining
 30 per cent said they would marry her, with one man saying she looked 
as though she could be introduced to his parents.
