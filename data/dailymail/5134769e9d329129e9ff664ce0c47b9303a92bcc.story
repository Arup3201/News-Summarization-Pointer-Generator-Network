A second Paris complete with a replica Champs-Elysees was built at the end of the First World War to fool German bombers, it has emerged.

Details of the incredible creation emerged as the French capital prepares to commemorate the 93rd anniversary of the Armistice.

According to archives unearthed by Le Figaro newspaper, military planners believed German pilots could be fooled into destroying the dummy city rather than the real one.

It was situated on the northern 
outskirts of Paris and featured sham streets lined with electric lights,
replica buildings and even a copy of the Gare du Nord - the station 
from which high-speed trains now travel to and from London.

'Nearly
a century after the start of the First World War, very little is still 
known about this incredible project by the French Army,' writes Benjamin
Ferran, of Le Figaro, highlighting the work of the DCA air defence 
group (Difense Contre Avions)

'In
1918, as the conflict was coming to an end, the DC, which was 
responsible for defending territory against air attacks, embarked on the
building of a replica Paris designed to fool the German pilots.

Bombing in Belleville had left destruction, which military officials wanted to avoid by building the fake city

'By recreating a dummy city including a myriad of bright lights, the French thought they could attract night raiders to the wrong target.'

Radar was in its infancy in 1918, and
the long-range Gotha heavy bombers being used by the German Imperial 
Airforce were similarly primitive.

Their
crew would hold bombs by the fins and then drop them on any target they
could see during quick sorties over major cities like Paris and London.

French planners chose
an area around the commuter town of Maisons-Laffitte, some 15 miles 
from the centre of Paris, and on a stretch of the River Seine similar to
the one in the capital.

The Germans were using long-range Gotha bombers to bombard the city

Famous quartiers of Paris, including those around the Arc de Triomphe and Opera, were created, as well as industrial suburbs like Saint-Denis and Aubervilliers.

Private firms were used to create the city, with an electrical engineer called Fernand Jacopozzi hired to illuminate the second 'City of Light'.

Wooden replicas of buildings were completed with ingenious details, including translucent paint creating the impression of the 'dirty glass roofs of factories'.

White, yellow and red lamps were also used to create the effect of machines in operation at night, while false trains and rail tracks were also partly illuminated at night.

But, despite such details, the replica Paris was not quite finished before the last German air raid in Paris, in September 1918, meaning it was never tested.

While Paris remained largely unscathed from both World Wars, London was severely damaged, with thousands killed or injured.

A raid by Gothas on the English capital in June 1917 saw 162 people killed, including 46 children at a kindergarten in Poplar, in the East End. Up to 500 more people were injured.

One of the reasons for the high number of casualties was because bombing raids were a relative novelty in Britain, with many civilians crowding together to watch them.

Paris, in contrast, prepared far better. At the end of the war Jacopozzi was honoured for his defensive work, and went on to find fame illuminating the Eiffel Tower for the first time.
