Tracey Connelly, the cruel mother who allowed her son Baby P to be tortured to death, has been seen on a trip to the supermarket as she enjoys her new life out of prison.

The 32-year-old, who ballooned to more than 22st while in a Durham jail, was spotted strolling to the shops from her bail hostel with a cheerful friend.

Clutching a 'bag for life' Connelly walked into Aldi to pick up some food before grabbing a bargain in Poundland.

An onlooker said she was also seen looking at posters advertising Christmas food offer, presumably planning for the festive period, but others shoppers clearly had no idea who she was.

'She had a shopping bag on her shoulder and looked like she was really enjoying herself,' a witness told The Sun.

'No one clocked her in the supermarket — they barely gave a second look. They had no idea they were exchanging glances with one of Britain's most notorious criminals.'

Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing 
nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend 
Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen.

Peter was 
just 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at 
his mother’s flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 
separate injuries, including a broken back.

Ploy: Maxine Carr was smuggled out of jail in the footwell of a car in 2004 when she left prison

The case provoked a 
national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and 
doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the 
child’s life.

As she was granted parole, Connelly 
had begged for an anonymity order and round-the-clock police protection,
 but ministers refused.

These orders are rare and only four are currently in force.

These
 apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger’s murderers Robert 
Thompson and Jon Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi
 for Soham murderer Ian Huntley.

Instead Connelly has been given a new name and released in an area far from Haringey, where Peter was killed.

It was alleged that she may have been helped out of her Durham jail in convoy of vehicles carrying 'dummy' obese women.

Sources said that extra vehicles containing women of a similar weight with their faces covered could also be used to throw anyone keen to follow her off the scent.

The same ploy was used when Maxine Carr left prison.

In 2004, when Carr left Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire, she was stowed in the footwell of a car at the same time as several similar vehicles also left.
