A sheriff's deputy who shot dead a 13-year-old Californian boy after mistaking his fake AK-47 for a real gun opened fire before his partner was even able to get out of the patrol car, it has emerged.

Andy Lopez was shot seven times in a Santa Rosa parking lot by Sonoma County Sheriff's Deputy Erick Gelhaus after police received reports of a suspicious person.

Accounts of just how quickly the shooting took place have been bolstered by investigators confirming that a second officer, a trainee, stayed at the wheel of the police car while Gelhaus approached the boy.

According to the Press Democrat, Santa Rosa police Lieutenant Paul Henry said that within seconds Gelhaus ordered the teenager to drop the weapon before his partner could take cover behind the open door of the vehicle.

The account seems to back up eyewitness claims and dispatch records that claim that only ten seconds elapsed between Gelhaus confronting Lopez and shooting him.

The latest development comes as protestors continue to call for Gelhaus to face charges over the shooting.

Lieutenant Henry told the Press Democrat: 'Deputy Gelhaus was able to engage more quickly because he didn't have to drive the vehicle.

'By the time (Gelhaus's partner) had exited his door and taken cover, at that point Deputy Gelhaus had already engaged the subject, with the commands and with the weapon.

'The threat was essentially over.'

Police also revealed that Lopez was wearing a hooded sweatshirt but had the hood down and was not wearing headphones that might have affected his hearing.

The patrol car Gelhaus and his partner were using was not equipped with either audio or video recording equipment.

Yesterday hundreds of demonstrators marched to protest the fatal shooting which has sparked community outrage and an FBI investigation.

Officers monitored from rooftops and 
others wearing helmets stood guard at barricades while protesters 
rallied outside the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office in Santa Rosa.

The protesters, including middle- and high-school-age students and members of the Occupy Oakland movement, assembled in downtown Santa Rosa before marching through streets with signs and hooded sweatshirts bearing photos of the boy.

'Andy Lopez did not have to die,' they chanted during the nearly three-hour, peaceful demonstration.

No arrests were made.

The demonstration came on the same day mourners bid farewell to Lopez at his funeral.

The
service was open to the public, and his sobbing parents were surrounded
by dozens of people as they clung to a wooden coffin.

Lopez
was shot and killed October 22 by Gelhaus, a firearms instructor who 
authorities said mistook a pellet gun carried by Lopez for an assault 
rifle.

Investigators say the hoodie-wearing 
teen didn't comply with commands to drop the gun and was turning toward 
deputies while raising the barrel when he was shot multiple times.

The shooting has generated several protests in Santa Rosa, located about 50 miles northwest of San Francisco

The
shooting has generated several protests in Santa Rosa, located about 50
miles northwest of San Francisco. On Sunday, more than 1,000 people 
turned out for a service to remember Lopez.

Sonoma
County Assistant Sheriff Lorenzo Duenas said Gelhaus, 48, has been a 
Sonoma County firearms instructor and rangemaster for 19 years and has 
trained his law enforcement colleagues in the use of force.

He is one of 26 such instructors for the county.

Gelhaus
also teaches pistol, carbine, shotgun and rifle lessons for Gunsite, a 
private company in Arizona, according to the company's website.

The deputy, who has received death threats after the incident that sparked outrage in the California community, has broad experience with guns and regularly contributed to law enforcement magazines and online forums, warning his comrades that they may be required to use lethal force to stay safe.

According to his online profiles, Gelhaus served as an infantry squad leader in Iraq and is an avid hunter in North America as well as Africa.

However, officials told Sfgate.com the deputy has not fired at a suspect in 24 years with the department, where he serves as a field training officer for new recruits and trains colleagues to shoot at the department's gun range.

But in a 2008 article for monthly policing and gun rights magazine, S.W.A.T., he gave other officers advice on what to do if the possibility arises.

'Today is the day you may need to kill someone in order to go home,' he wrote. 'If you cannot turn on the 'mean gene' for yourself, who will? If you find yourself in an ambush, in the kill zone, you need to turn on that mean gene.'

He went on: 'Taking some kind of action - any kind of action - is critical. If you shut down (physically, psychologically, or both) and stay in the kill zone, bad things will happen to you. You must take some kind of action.'

Sonoma County Assistant Sheriff 
Lorenzo Duenas described his colleague as a 'respected and solid 
employee' who recieved the sheriff's medal of valor in 2004 for rescuing
people from a burning car.

The
deputy, who served in Iraq in 2005, is on paid leave pending the 
investigation and his attorney declined to comment to the newspaper 
website.

The man's identity was revealed just 
hours afterÂ two witnesses claimed he only shouted at Lopez one time to 
drop his weapon before firing.

Police say that Gelhaus fear that his life and that of his partner were in danger when he opened fire.

During a news conference on Wednesday authorities displayed a real assault weapon and the pellet gun - which 
resembled an AK-47 with a black magazine and brown butt - to demonstrate
how difficult it is to tell them apart.

Federal law requires replica guns to have an orange tip, but Lopez's toy rifle didn't have one.

Police
also revealed that Lopez had his back to the deputies, so they didn't 
realize he was so young.

They
claim Lopez was about 20 to 30 feet from them when he turned with the 
barrel of the gun pointing toward them and they opened fire because they
feared for their lives.
