Motorists could be forced to pay to use new motorways and trunk roads in a radical overhaul of the transport network.

David Cameron will today announce a road and rail building drive, aimed at slashing journey times and easing traffic at blackspots.

But there are fears the plans could lead to a two-tier system for motorists – and even cause more accidents.

Driving up costs: Firms may charge motorists to use pay-as-you-go fast lanes under Government plans

The Prime Minister is understood to be keen for private firms to build and operate motorways and highways.

These firms could install pay-as-you-go fast lanes or users could be charged a higher rate of road tax to cover the costs, with spy cameras to catch those who use them without paying. Drivers who stick to B-roads and single lane A-roads would see a cut in duty.

Massive investment in the nation's transport system is at the heart of a strategy to be unveiled by the Coalition leaders today.

A source said: 'Speeding up the transport network will cut costs and save time for business in the long term.'

The Government has ruled out any more tolls on existing roads, but they could be charged on new routes.

The AA has warned against a 'first class and second class' road system, adding that more traffic diversions could increase accidents.

Mr Cameron is also set to approve the controversial high-speed rail line linking London, Birmingham and the North of England.

According to a leak of the proposed route for the £34bn HS2 project, Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds will be the big winners from the Y-shaped network, which see trains travelling at 225mph on two separate lines from the West Midlands to the north west and north east.

A Downing Street source compared the plans for the road network to the 1989 privatisation of water companies 'which had also gone through years of chronic under-investment'.

The Government have ruled out any more tolls on existing roads, but they could be charged on new routes.
