The Archbishop of Canterbury warned yesterday against ‘pinning hopes on individuals’ at the top to solve our problems.

The Most Rev Justin Welby said that ignoring complexity and human weaknesses left us  ‘unreasonably disappointed’ with everyone ‘from politicians to NHS, education to environment’.

Ten days after being enthroned as head of the Church of England, he warned against what he called the ‘hero leader culture’.

He told worshippers at Canterbury Cathedral: ‘A political party gets a new leader and three months later there is comment about disappointment.

‘An economy suffers the worst blow in generations with a debt crisis and economic downturn, and the fact that not everything is perfect within five years is seen as total failure.’

Turning to reports on Friday that only 40 per cent of churchgoers are convinced the new archbishop can resolve the problems of the Church of England, he said: ‘I do hope that means the other 60 per cent thought the idea so barking mad that they did not answer the question.’

Mr Welby said: ‘Put not your trust in new leaders, better systems, new organisations or regulatory reorganisation.

‘They may well be good and necessary, but will to some degree fail.

Complexities: The Most Rev Justin Welby said ignoring complexity and humanity left us 'unreasonably disappointed' with everyone 'from politicians to NHS, education to environment'

'Cruelty': Mr Welby told worshippers at 
Canterbury Cathedral that setting people or institutions up to heights 
where they can only fail was 'mere cruelty'.

‘Human sin means pinning  hopes on individuals is always a mistake, and assuming that any organisation is able to have such good systems that human failure will be eliminated is naive.’

He added: ‘Human fallibility recognised, God’s sovereignty trusted – these are also the only stable foundation for human beings in society.

‘Setting people or institutions up to heights where they cannot but fail is mere cruelty.’

The 57-year-old former oil executive added: ‘Holy Week and Easter show us the reality of God and of human beings.

‘It is a reality that equips us for action in the world, action that is based on hope and realism, not on cynicism or fear.’

Warning: The Archbishop used his first Easter Sunday sermon to warn against 'pinning hopes in individuals' in politics and public life

At the Vatican newly-elected Pope Francis was also giving his first Easter Sunday address since becoming the leader of the Catholic church.

His unwillingness to embrace Vatican pomp has already earned him a reputation as an ‘austerity’ Pope and the new pontiff used his address to preach what he practises – with an attack on greed and selfishness.

Pope Francis’s greeting from the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica reflected his push for social justice.

He lamented the ‘world still divided by greed looking for easy gain, wounded by the selfishness that threatens human life and the family’.

Delivery: Pope Francis delivers the Urbi et Orbi message and blessing to at least 250,000 faithful after the Easter Holy Mass at St Peter's Square

Call for peace: Pope Francis used his first 'Urbi et Orbi' blessing to call for peace

End to conflicts: In his first Easter speech, Francis called for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, an end to the civil war in Syria, and political solutions to conflicts in several African countries

'Guardians of creation': The former Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina condemned the 'iniquitous exploitation of natural resources' and urged everyone to be 'guardians' of creation

Message: Francis said the message of Easter is that faith can help people transform their lives by letting 'those desert places in our hearts bloom'

During his address, Francis said he 
wished a ‘happy Easter’ greeting could reach every ‘home and family, 
especially where the suffering is greatest in hospitals and prisons’.

The Pope also decried terrorism and what he called the 21st century’s most extensive form of slavery – human trafficking.

Since the start of his Papacy a fortnight ago Francis has eschewed Vatican grandeur.

He has refused to move into the 
luxurious Papal apartments, which he claimed were ‘big enough for 300 
people’, and continues to wear a plastic wristwatch, plain iron crucifix
and scruffy black shoes.

As Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis lived in a simple one-bedroom flat and travelled by public transport.

Since his election the Argentine has 
put his concern for the poor at the heart of his speeches. Yesterday, he
did not mention the Falklands dispute, in which Argentine president 
Cristina Kirchner has asked him to intervene.

But, like previous Popes, he urged 
Israelis and Palestinians to resume peace talks and expressed regret for
a series of conflicts including Syria, the Congo and North Korea.

The address followed a mass  celebrated on the steps of the great basilica, where around 250,000 pilgrims were gathered.

Afterwards, flanked by heavy 
security, Francis asked to tour the square by popemobile, so he could 
embrace children and the sick.

In a typically down-to-earth gesture, he even gave a thumbs-up to someone in the crowd.

He also greeted around 30 cardinals who attended.

Most of the cardinals who voted in the conclave had returned to administer Easter mass to their own congregations.

Former pope Benedict XVI, who resigned in February, was not present.

Following concern that his presence in Rome could undermine his 
successor’s authority Benedict is contemplating a return to his native 
Germany, according to Italian media.

The Pope Emeritus had planned to move into a cloistered convent inside the Vatican.

However, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica said that with his homeland
‘still in his heart and in his mind’ he is thinking of retiring to a 
monastery in Bavaria.

Benedict, may apparently choose to live at a Bavarian shrine Altötting, 
to which he dedicated a page of his memoirs. This would allow him to be 
near his brother Georg.
