The billionaire founder of Foxtons is suing a London garage after his rare £1million Lamborghini blew up while his son was driving it. 

Property tycoon Jon Hunt claims that the wrong type of spark plugs was fitted when his Lamborghini Miura SV was serviced by the garage last year.

His son had driven less than a mile from the Lamborghini London garage when he noticed white smoke coming from the engine. Just minutes later, the 1971 car burst into flames.

On fire: The Lamborghini Miura SV burst into flames less than a mile from the luxury car garage in Acton. Mr Hunt claims that the wrong type of spark plug was fitted when the 1971 supercar was serviced last April

Fireball: The dramatic moment was captured on camera and posted to YouTube. Mr Hunt's son was not injured in the incident but the vehicle was reducted to a charred shell on the A40 in Acton

Mr Hunt's son, who is not named in the claim, was not injured, but the vehicle, considered the world's first supercar, was reduced to a charred shell on the A40 in Acton.

The dramatic moment was captured on camera by car enthusiasts who uploaded the video to YouTube. 

Now Mr Hunt, 61, whose wealth was valued at more than £1billion by the Times Rich List this year, is suing luxury car specialists, H.R. Owen Dealerships Ltd, who handled the work.

He is claiming £700,000 in compensation for the destroyed supercar, plus damages for storage and 'loss of enjoyment' of the vehicle. The garage is well-known car dealer to the rich and famous.

When Lamborghini's flagship car was launched in 1966, the Miura generated much publicity as the world's fastest road car. Only 764 have ever been built. 

It is formed part of Mr Hunt's extensive collection of supercars - which also includes vintage Ferraris.

In a claim lodged at London's High Court, Daniel Scarrott, for Mr Hunt, said that H.R Owen, 'held itself out as having particular expertise in the repair and servicing of Lamborghini motor vehicles.'

Wreckage: Mr Hunt, whose wealth was valued at more than £1billion by the Times Rich List this year, is claiming £700,000 in compensation, plus damages for storage and 'loss of enjoyment' of the vehicle

'The defendant agreed to inspect, assess and service the vehicle' the claim states, adding that H.R Owen owed Mr Hunt 'a duty of care to exercise the reasonable care and skill of an expert Lamborghini repairer and service.'

Mr Scarrott continues: 'On December 19th 2012 Mr Hunt delivered the vehicle to the defendant's garage on School Road, North Acton.

'The defendant thereafter purported to perform the services and in particular carried out a service of the vehicle and replaced the engine oil, filter and spark plugs.

Car enthusiast: Mr Hunt, who founded estate agents Foxtons, built a garage under his Kensington home where he stores his collection of vintage Ferraris 

'The defendant notified Mr Hunt that the services had been completed and the vehicle was ready for collection. 

'On 5th April 2013 Mr Hunt, by his son, attended the garage to collect the vehicle.

'Mr Hunt's son was then provided with the keys to the vehicle... he then proceeded to drive into London along the A40.

'As the vehicle proceeded along the A40, the vehicle did not appear to be running smoothly... within less than one mile of the garage, the vehicle's engine gave off a puff of white smoke'.

Mr Scarrott says that, at this stage, Mr Hunt's son pulled over and was advised by a garage employee who was nearby in another vehicle to drive the car back to the garage.

'Mr Hunt's son then proceeded to drive off with a view to returning to the garage. As he did so he noticed a smell of an old car and a further wisp of white smoke and an unexpected noise.

'There was then a deep percussion noise and the engine of the vehicle caught fire. In that fire the vehicle was substantially damaged.

The lawyer goes on to allege that mechanics at the garage had put in the wrong type of spark plugs when they serviced the car.

He claimed: 'The spark plugs fitted worked at too high a temperature and created the risk of fire.

'The fire was caused by the ignition of fuel. Such ignition could not have taken place unless the fuel system was not intact or the spark plugs were not properly adjusted or fitted.

'Both of these matters could have been avoided by a competent service of the vehicle.'

Mr Scarrott also puts forward an alternative case that the fire was caused by the engine's timing being out and its carburettor not being properly adjusted.

The claim states that Mr Hunt is claiming for the loss of the £900,000 car, but agrees to offset the £200,000 salvage value it has even as a burnt out shell.

He is also claiming additional damages for loss of use of the car and storage costs. 

At Mr Hunt's mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens, there is an underground museum specially designed to house his collection of vintage Ferraris.

And in 2012 he sold a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO for a reputed £20.2million - at the time Britain's most expensive car.

The billionaire made his fortune when he sold Foxtons, a company he founded in a former pasta restaurant in London's Notting Hill, for £360million to a private equity firm in 2007.

Since leaving the firm he has managed to almost triple the cash he received for the sale by investing in property – leaving him with an estimated fortune of £925million.

He also owns a  Suffolk estate, Heveningham Hall, near his childhood home. It is an 18th century Grade I listed Palladian country house with 25 bedrooms, 19 bathrooms, 12 receptions, set in 460 acres.

H.R Owen's defence was not available from the court and the contents of the claim have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge.

A spokeswoman for H.R Owen told the Evening Standard: 'This is a case between two insurance companies, but H.R Owen continue to do business with Jon Hunt.'

The company has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.
