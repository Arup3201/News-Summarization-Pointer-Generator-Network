A young mother has told how she saw a mysterious silver object hovering in the sky above her house this morning.

Elyse O'Neill, 26, took these photographs on her smart phone after spotting what she described as a car-sized, silvery object above her back garden in Wallis, Pembrokeshire, early today.

The mother-of-one said she watched as the UFO split into two, reconnected, and then flew off.

Elyse O'Neill, 26, says she saw this bright object hovering above her garden in Wallis, Pembrokeshire, today

She said: 'I was standing in the garden at 6.45am smoking a cigarette when this thing shot across from the moor over on the right, and stopped right in front of me.Â 

'It was so bizarre, it took my breath away.

'I ran inside to get my phone. There wasn't enough battery left to film it, but there was enough to take pictures, so I started snapping away.

'It was hovering, spinning like a top, and as I watched it, it split up vertically into two pieces.'

She added: 'I'm a country girl and I know what sheep sound like, but the sheep in the field beyond were making a horrible, high pitched sound all the time it was there.

'Slowly, the two pieces joined back together and then about 15 seconds later it just shot off straight up into the sky - in the blink of an eye.

'I've never seen anything move so 
fast. I've seen a shooting star before and it was faster than that - 
there's no way it could be man-made, it moved too fast.

'As soon as it went, the sheep fell silent. It was chilling.'

Miss O'Neill, who works as a horse-trainer, showed her photographs to relatives, who told her that her own aunt and grandmother had experienced unexplainable sightings over the same moor, thought only at night.

But she remains skeptical about what she saw.

'I can't explain it,' she said. 'It moved too fast to be of this earth, but I don't believe in aliens.'

Nick Pope, an expert on UFOs and a former government adviser on unexplained phenomena, said: 'This is truly bizarre and what makes it particularly mysterious is the description of the way the object moved from a hover to a high speed in an instant.

'This rules out most of the conventional explanations such as aircraft lights, a meteor/fireball, or a Chinese lantern.

'Perhaps it was some new secret, prototype spy plane or drone, but if not, it's a genuine mystery. It would be fascinating to find out if anything unusual was tracked on radar.'

Yesterday schoolgirl Georgina Heap, 16, told how she saw a mysterious black ring in the sky above Leamington Spa.

Miss Heap, who videoed the ring on her phone as she watched it with friends, said it floated 'like a cloud' before disappearing.
