Denial: Police questioned Luis Bracamontes, above, as he tried to cross into the U.S. from Mexico on Saturday. He denied any involvement in Emily's removal from the Phoenix Children's Hospital

The father of an 11-year-old girl suffering from leukaemia who was inexplicably removed from hospital by her mother has been questioned by police.

United States Customs and Border Patrol Officers stopped Luis Bracamontes as he tried to cross into America from Mexico on Saturday.

The man was quizzed about the whereabouts of his daughter Emily, but reportedly denied any involvement in her disappearance and could not provide any information.

Emily had
been receiving chemotherapy at Phoenix Children's Hospital for about a month when her mother Norma Bracamontes  removed an IV drip from her arm, changed her clothes and walked her out of the facility last Wednesday night.

The Hispanic girl was previously forced to have her arm amputated because of an infection, while a catheter was also placed in her heart.

Camera footage shows the 35-year-old mother
pushing an IV stand through the hospital's hallways while her daughter, 
whose bandaged arm is visible, can be seen following her.

The girl was set to have the device removed and be released from hospital the following day.

Police warned that if the catheter is left in for too long Emily could develop another deadly infection.

Police said that Mr Bracamontes was not driving the same black Ford van in which Emily left the hospital in when they stopped him.

Last sighting: Leukemia patient Emily is seen with her mother Norma on Phoenix Children's Hospital CCTV

Putting a stop to treatment: Emily's mother removed a IV drip from a catheter in her heart and helped her change clothes before leading her out of the hospital

Following a lengthy search, police 
are still unaware of the girl's location. They have described the family
as 'nomadic' and without a
permanent residence, but said they have relatives in Arizona, California
and Mexico.

None of the relatives have been able to provide police with information about their
whereabouts.

Following Emily's removal from the hospital, Phoenix Police's Steve Martos said: 'If she contracts an infection, it really could just be a
matter of days that could result in the young girl's death. It's
pretty serious.'

Martos said neither parent has been charged with a
crime yet, but authorities want the child brought back to the hospital before
it is too late.

'We just don't know what their intent was,' Martos said.

'But this could become extremely serious if she contracts an infection. Our primary
concern is she get the proper medical care so we can prevent obviously the
worst case scenario here.'

Leaving early: The 11-year-old, pictured with her mother and a young boy, was not to leave hospital until the following day

Concerns: Doctors are worried Emily could die from an infection of the heart if the catheter is not medically removed

The girl's father is a Mexican citizen with a U.S. resident
alien identification card. The child and her mother are U.S. citizens.

Phoenix Children's Hospital spokeswoman Jane Walton declined
to comment, citing health privacy laws.

Authorities do not know why the child's parents took her from
the hospital, but speculate they might have been concerned with paying the
bill.

Missing: The group left the hospital in a black Ford on Wednesday night and Emily has not been seen since
