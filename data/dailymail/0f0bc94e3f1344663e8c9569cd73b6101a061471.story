Sulley Muntari has shown his generosity as the Ghana star visited one of the poorest communities in Brazil to hand out money to locals.

As well as handing out cash, Muntari signed autographs and posed for photographs with local children in Maceio.

The AC Milan midfielder was reportedly given special permission from Ghana manager Kwesi Appiah to visit the city.
