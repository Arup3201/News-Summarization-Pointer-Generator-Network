Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League.

1) The dramatic Manchester United equaliser that followed the dismissal of Branislav Ivanovic was a reminder that the depth of Chelsea’s squad remains to be tested.

He was one of seven players in the side that lined up at Old Trafford who have started every Premier League game this season, while Oscar has missed only one match. Cesar Azpilicueta was ever present before this game, while Diego Costa has missed just two.

Manager Jose Mourinho has given starts to just 16 players in total, compared to the 23 used so far by biggest title rivals Manchester City.

If Chelsea want to match the achievements of Arsenal’s 2003-4 Invincibles they can’t afford too many suspensions. The legendary Gunners side had nine players who appeared in more than 30 League games.

2) Southampton need to start talking to midfielder Jack Cork about a new contract or risk losing the midfielder for nothing when his current deal expires next summer.

The 25-year-old has struggled to break into Ronald Koeman’s first team, but after playing his part in the 8-0 destruction of Sunderland was again excellent in the win over Stoke.

In the 62 minutes before he was subbed after taking a knock he’d found a team mate with 38 of his 40 passes, and covered more ground (5.0 miles) than any other Saints player.

3) Letting Jack Colback move up the road to Newcastle for nothing always seemed an odd bit of business by Sunderland, and the flame haired midfielder continues to be one of Alan Pardew’s key players.

Any of the quarter-backs playing in Sunday’s NFL game at Wembley would have appreciated the pass he hit for Sammy Ameobi’s goal seven seconds after half time at Tottenham.

And Colback, described earlier this season by Roy Hodgson as the ‘ginger Andrea Pirlo’, continued to be an unsung hero in the Toon’s 2-1 win, only once failing to find a team mate with a pass in the entire 90 minutes.

4) James Collins might not be the world’s greatest centre back with the ball at his feet, but when it comes to courage the Welsh international is never found wanting.

The 31-year-old set the tone early in the game for West Ham’s committed defending against Manchester City by getting hit in a defensive wall without flinching.

He went on to make three more equally brave blocks, won 100 per cent of his heading duels, and his 12 clearances were as many as the rest of Hammers’ defence put together.

5) Saido Berahino is the young man you want when there’s a crucial penalty to be taken – as he proved by slotting away West Bromwich Albion’s injury time equaliser against Crystal Palace.

The striker has never failed to score from 12 yards, and insisted on keeping spot kick duties despite the arrival in the summer of midfielder Craig Gardner – who took them successfully for both Sunderland and Birmingham.

He’s justified that with three now among his eight goals this campaign – and also scored a crucial one that helped England’s Under 21 side qualify for next summer’s European Championship finals.

6) Winger Jefferson Montero has been Swansea’s super-sub all season, appearing in all but one of their Premier League matches but never getting more than 25 minutes.

That finally changed when he got his first League start against Leicester, and the 25-year-old Ecuador international made the most of the chance.

His pace – only Wayne Routledge recorded a quicker top speed than his 20.5mph - made him a constant threat, and he laid on the chance for Wilfried Bony’s second goal in the 2-0 win.

7) Brighton boss Sami Hyppia needs to get his strikers firing – of the four forwards on his books only Craig Mackail-Smith has hit the target in the Championship with the princely sum of one goal.

When Joe Bennett gave the Seagulls the lead against Rotherham it was the eighth of the club’s last nine to be scored by a defender – making it all the more annoying when former Brighton frontman Alex Revell grabbed an equaliser.

8) Mick McCarthy has always prided himself on the resilience of his teams, but his Ipswich side have suddenly developed an inability to hang on to a lead.

In the last four games they have let nine points slip away from winning positions, and the latest came when Nahki Wells struck twice to help Huddersfield recover from being 2-0 down at Portman Road.

9) Notts County’s rookie boss Shaun Derry raised eyebrows in the summer when he brought in five players aged over 30 as part of an overhaul of the club’s squad that saw 17 leave and 14 new arrivals.

The former QPR midfielder’s trust in signing senior pros in an era when most clubs just want young prospects with a resale value is working pretty well.

Their 1-0 success at Scunthorpe, achieved when on loan Wolves winger Zeli Ismail converted a last minute penalty, was his team’s sixth win in a row and took them into third place in League One.

10) Jamie Cureton has a career average of a goal every three games, which is not bad for a 39-year-old with 766 senior appearances behind him, stretching right back to when he made his debut for Norwich in November 1994.

He remains as consistent as ever. His strike that earned Dagenham a 1-1 draw at Wycombe in League Two was his fifth in 15 League appearances this season.
