Personal messages left by Prince William for his ‘babykins’ Kate Middleton were hacked by the News of the World, a court heard yesterday.

In one voicemail the Duke of Cambridge, who was at Sandhurst military academy at the time, told his future wife he was nearly shot while on an Army training exercise.

Prince Harry’s voicemail was also intercepted, the phone-hacking trial was told.

A joke message apparently left by 
William in which he called his younger brother ‘ginger’, put on a 
high-pitched voice and pretended to be Harry’s then-girlfriend Chelsy 
Davy was hacked.

Prosecutor 
Andrew Edis QC read the Old Bailey transcripts of the voice recordings –
 made in 2006 – which were discovered by detectives investigating 
hacking allegations. In one, William started by saying: ‘Hi baby’, 
adding: ‘Had a busy day today again.

‘I’ve
 been running around the woods of Aldershot chasing shadows and getting 
terribly lost, and I walked into some other regiment’s ambush, which was
 slightly embarrassing because I nearly got shot. Not by live rounds but
 by blank rounds, which would be very embarrassing though.

‘Um,
 er, yeah, I’m off on exercise tomorrow morning, just for the day, and 
then I’m back on Saturday first thing, erm, so I probably won’t be able 
to speak to you tomorrow night.’

He
 then told her he might send her ‘a cheeky text message’ because he 
might have his phone with him, before signing off: ‘All right, baby, 
lots of love, um, speak to you soon. Bye bye.’

Among
 the details of voicemails discovered by detectives at the home of 
private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was another call from William in 
which he said: ‘My head’s all right. I’ve just picked up your message. 
Oh, my little babykins! I hope you are all right.

‘I
 just tried ringing you but I do not think you would pick it up because 
it is 5.35am in the morning so it is probably not a very good time to 
ring you. I hope you are all right.’

In
 another message William says: ‘Hello baby, it’s me. Sorry I did not 
ring you earlier and tell you what I was doing. Been a bit of a 
nightmare day. I think I would just about be finished in a minute.

‘It
 has just gone six but I don’t think I will be able to leave here till 
about seven. I have got stuff here to do, bits and pieces, but I should 
be able to leave at about seven at the least. Crack on with what you 
have got to do and don’t worry about me. I will give you a buzz later.

News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman claimed Prince William was booted out of an Army party for ‘braying Hooray Henry’ antics in front of horrified guests, the court heard.

He emailed the paper’s deputy editor Neil Wallis in 2006 with an account of Prince Harry’s passing out party at Sandhurst. Goodman also said Kate Middleton shunned the party and did not get on with Harry’s then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC introduced the email alongside a hacked message recovered by police from royal aide Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton left by Sandhurst commandant Major General Andrew Ritchie referring to an ‘incident at the ball’.

A story containing large parts of Goodman’s claims appeared on April 16, 2006, under the headline ‘So silly Willy’, the court heard.

‘I
 always thought you were going to the gym. Hopefully I can come and see 
you. I will give you an update. Planning on definitely coming out, 
hopefully by sevenish, so I will be with you by quarter to eight at the 
latest. Hope that’s all right, baby. I can’t wait to see you. Lots of 
love and I’ll speak to you later.’

Clive Goodman exposed a joke by Prince William after hacking into Prince Harry's voicemail messages, the court heard.

The jury were read a transcript of a tape recovered in 2006 apparently left on Prince Harry's phone pretending to be girlfriend Chelsy Davy (pictured together above).

In it, he was dubbed a 'big, hairy fat ginger', and told 'you really are quite ugly for a ginger', the court heard.

The jokey message, delivered in a high pitched voice with a South African accent, was attributed to Prince William in one of Goodman's stories printed on April 9,, 2006

The message said: 'Hi its Chelsy here, I just want to say I miss you so much, and I think you're the most - best looking ginger I've ever seen.

'Although you really are quite ugly for a ginger, I hope you're having a lovely time, I really miss you.

'It's lovely out here in Africa and hopefully I'll see you very soon, you big hairy fat ginger, anyway, speak to you later.'

In
 one call, William talks of wanting to go on a drag hunt with beagles: 
‘Hi honey, it’s me. I’m back in the small land of Sandhurst. A couple of
 pretty nasty days on exercise. Decided to just enjoy them. I am feeling
 a bit s***** at the moment but hope you are OK. Lovely to speak to 
you...

‘You are probably 
very busy working but if there is any chance you are free, maybe later 
this afternoon or evening, I might be able to get out. I am going to try
 and go out beagling again and then come to you afterwards.

‘So
 if you are around at home this evening I would love to see you. Let me 
know. Give me a text or ring back. I am around about the rest of the 
day.’

The prosecuting 
lawyer then read excerpts from the voicemail which it is claimed was 
left by William for Harry, quoting from it: ‘Hi its Chelsy here, I just 
want to say I miss you so much, and I think you’re the most – best 
looking ginger I’ve ever seen.

‘Although
 you really are quite ugly for a ginger, I hope you’re having a lovely 
time, I really miss you. It’s lovely out here in Africa and hopefully 
I’ll see you very soon, you big hairy fat ginger, anyway, speak to you 
later.’

In January 2006 a 
story appeared in the News of the World headlined ‘William shot in 
ambush’. The court heard the ‘babykins’ nickname appeared in an 
exclusive by Clive Goodman on February 12, 2006 which said: ‘Wills wants
 the girl he calls “babykins” to be his princess.’

William
 and Kate, who met at St Andrews University in 2001, were first 
romantically linked in 2004. They split briefly in 2007 but were engaged
 in 2010 and married the following year.

Former
 News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, and former editor
 Andy Coulson are accused of conspiring to hack phones between October 
3, 2000, and August 9, 2006, along with former News International chief 
executive Rebekah Brooks.

Mrs
 Brooks faces two counts of conspiring with others to commit misconduct 
in public office linked to alleged inappropriate payments to public 
officials.

She also faces 
two allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice: one with
 her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter and a second with her 
husband, Charles Brooks, and former News International head of security 
Mark Hanna and others.

Mr 
Coulson faces two allegations that he conspired with former NOTW royal 
editor Goodman, 56, and others to commit misconduct in public office.

The defendants deny all charges. The trial continues.

Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks faces a series of charges linked to the phone hacking of celebrities and others

Rebekah Brooks 'categorically' denies making a corrupt payment to a serving member of the armed forces or the Ministry of Defence or to a serving police officer, an Old Bailey jury has heard.

The former editor of the News of the World and the Sun newspapers made the flat-out denials in 2012 while being interviewed by police officers who were investigating claims that telephones had been hacked.

She was responding to questions about how she ran the top-selling tabloids while she was in charge.

The written statements she prepared to rebut the allegations were read out to the jury.

In the statement she made on March 21 2012, Brooks told detectives: 'I categorically deny the allegation that you have put to me that I was involved in a conspiracy to make corrupt payments to the serving member of the armed forces, or the employee of the MoD.'

In another denial she made during a police interview on October 4 2012, Brooks said: 'I have chosen to answer the allegations that you have put to me today by means of a statement. I have never knowingly authorised a corrupt payment to a serving police officer.

'I have never had a serving police officer as a paid source as editor of the Sun and the News of the World. I never sanctioned either explicitly or implicitly corrupt payments to serving police officers.'
