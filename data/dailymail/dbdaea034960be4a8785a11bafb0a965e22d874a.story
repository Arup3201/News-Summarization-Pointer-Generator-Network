CNN has been forced to apologise after playing Billy Joel's song Only the Good Die Young following a segment about the Sikh temple massacre in Wisconsin.

A panel on Monday morning's Starting Point discussed the shooting - in which six people were killed and three injured - with Narinder Singh, the chairman of the board
of trustees for the Sikh Coalition.

Then after cutting to a three-minute commercial break, the program returned with the song - and the show's hosts seemed unaware of the thoughtless choice.

Gaffe: CNN came under fire for playing the song Only The Good Die Young after an interview with Narinder Singh, from the Sikh Coalition, who was talking about the Sikh temple shootings in Wisconsin

The song contains the lyrics: 'They showed you a statue, told you to pray, they built you a temple and locked you away. But they never told you the price that you pay... Only the good die young.'

It was part of a playlist chosen by the day's guest, New York Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf.

'That’s why you were singing along with me this morning,' host Zoraida Sambolin joked with Sheinkopf as the song played.

'That’s the only reason I came 
here, was to sing that song,' he said. 'Why else would I be here in the 
morning?'

On Twitter, viewers lambasted the channel's poor choice.

'Wow. Cold-hearted folks there at CNN,' user Porter Versfelt said.

CNN released an apology hours later: 'We aired a song from our guest’s playlist on the morning show, which aired following a three-minute commercial break and before a segment on presidential politics, unrelated to the Wisconsin shooting.

'Given the news of the day, this was regrettable and we apologize to our viewers.'

The gaffe comes just eight days after the network played Pink's hit song Stupid Girls before a story about former Alaska governor Sarah Palin on CNN Sunday Morning.

Not the first time: Last week, the network featured a picture of Sarah Palin while Pink's 'Stupid Girls' played

The song continued playing as host Randi Kaye indicated to a picture of Palin and her husband enjoying Chik-fil-A after the fast food chain condemned gay marriage.

CNN apologised through a statement to Newsbusters: 'The music selection was a poor choice and was not intended to be linked to any news story. We regret any perception that they were planned together.'
