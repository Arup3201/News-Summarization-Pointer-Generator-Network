Sergio Aguero says the experience of scoring in a Manchester derby is unparalleled.

The Argentine has scored six goals in derby meetings with United and is planning on adding to that tally when the two sides meet at Old Trafford on Sunday.

'I always love to score, but of course it is even more special to score in the big games,' he said.

Aguero says scoring against Manchester United is enough to give him shivers

The Argentine forward has scored six times against United, including this one at the Etihad in September 2013

'If you score against United at Old Trafford it almost give you shivers, because you can feel the tense atmosphere with most of the stadium being really quiet, but the away end going crazy.

'At home it is different, when the City supporters are really loud in these games, it sometimes gives me goose bumps when they sing my name.'

The Argentine forward has hailed fellow South American Radamel Falcao ahead of the derby.

'They (Manchester United) have a number of very talented strikers. The one who in his career has been the most predatory is Falcao.

'He isn't having an easy time this season, but I really admire his commitment and his class and qualities are permanent.

'He is probably one of the most naturally gifted strikers in football at the moment.'

Meanwhile, Aguero is refusing to give up hope of retaining the Premier League crown this season despite slipping to fourth, nine points behind leaders Chelsea.

'Of course we can still win the title,' he insisted.

'In football, anything can happen - as soon as you think something is certain, then everything changes, we have seen it so many times before and we'll see it again.

'We only focus on ourselves, try to win every game we play and keep pressure on Chelsea.'

Aguero was speaking at the #HeadtoHead event for Puma's 'evoSPEED 1.3' where he appeared alongside United's Radamel Falcao.
