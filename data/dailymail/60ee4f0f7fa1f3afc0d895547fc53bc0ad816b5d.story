QPR face a 194-mile coach journey back to West London after their game against Manchester United on Sunday, because they were unable to book out a train carriage for the return journey.

The club travelled up by train for the Premier League clash, but couldn't get the space for the way home.

And manager Harry Redknapp joked that it was because of too many Manchester United fans who live in London filling up the trains.

Opposing supporters often mock Manchester United's fans with claims that they commute from London 

Harry Redknapp said that his side were unable to book a train carriage for themselves for the way home

'We couldn’t get a carriage to ourselves, there’s no room,' Redknapp told The Sun. 'The problem is half the United fans will be heading back to London, too.' 

The club's vice-chairman Amit Bhatia had no travel problems as he posed outside Old Trafford with Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp and former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen.

Bhatia tweeted: Arrived in Manchester to watch @QPRFC vs @Manutd. Excited for today, come on urrrsssss. If we get a point #drinksonme'
