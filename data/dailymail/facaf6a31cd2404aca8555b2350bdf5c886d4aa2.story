Arsenal are staring at a  fifth-straight Champions League last 16 exit following their 3-1 first leg defeat at home to Monaco on Wednesday night - a defeat which has brought a dark cloud over the Gunners' season.

With that in mind, Sportsmail have Arsenal fan Lewis Potton of 90min.com to tell us what he makes of the situation.  Let's see what he had to say. 

After the drubbing Arsenal received at the hands of Monaco on Wednesday, the mood among fans is probably as low as it could be. It was not just the manner of the defeat that has hurt Gunners fans, but the false promise that came before it.

After the 2-0 victory over Manchester City last month, it looked as if Arsenal had finally learned how to handle the big occasion, a view shared by most fans I've spoken to. However, Wednesday night showed just how naive and frail this team can be on their day.

If we'd have come into the game on the back of defeats and poor form, as we did against Bayern in 2013, then the result may have been less humiliating. However, sitting third in the league and with some encouraging performances since Christmas, it was a different scenario altogether and made the whole experience all the more galling to watch.

Arsene Wenger found it painful viewing as his Arsenal side capitulated 3-1 at home to Monaco on Wednesday

Losing 3-1 at home hands the team an enormous task for the second-leg in France. A task I don't see this side capable of completing at this moment in time. There were so many shocking displays across the pitch on Wednesday night that it will take something truly historic for Arsenal to progress to the next stage.

According to Infostrada Sports, Arsenal have a 1.5 per cent chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals, and to be honest, that sounds spot on. Let's examine how Monaco have played in Europe this season. They conceded one goal in six matches in the Group Stage and were only breached last night by a top class Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain strike. If that is the calibre of goal needed for Arsenal to win in France, then 1.5 per cent looks generous. Compact and excellent on the break, Monaco were set up perfectly. Their 3-1 lead for the return leg also suits them. Arsenal will have to attack with numbers and will leave themselves open to the same counter-attacks we saw at the Emirates.

Optimists will point to Arsenal's experiences against Bayern in 2013; where we similarly lost 3-1 at home, before narrowly going out on away goals after a 2-0 win in Munich. The game in Monaco is a world away from that tie. Monaco won't open up because they are playing at home, like Bayern did. Boss Leonardo Jardim will have them playing the same system. Tight, compact and defensively sound.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave the Gunners hope when he made the score 2-1 late on before Monaco's third

What to say about the manager. Most of us love Arsene Wenger, but he had the wrong idea straight from selecting his team for this game. When will he learn that picking Cazorla and Ozil in a midfield three is not feasible in Europe? Rosicky should have started alongside Coquelin in midfield, at least giving some sort of base from which to play.

Some Arsenal fans like to get on Ozil's back because of his style of play, but it's like Wenger is putting a square peg in a round hole. He isn't the sort of player who will track back and battle for you and everyone knows that. Monreal has also played well of late and it was surprising that Wenger suddenly thrust Gibbs into the left back slot. Presumably because he is better going forward. It screamed as though Wenger and Arsenal wanted to put the game to bed at home and have an easy away game, which is ridiculous.

As a club, we should know by now that the Champions League is never that simple. Another season, another disappointment in Europe for Arsenal.

Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla shouldn't have started together in midfield for Arsenal on Wednesday night
