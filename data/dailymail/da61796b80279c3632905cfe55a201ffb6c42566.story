Gareth Bale is approaching the end of his second season at Real Madrid, but the world's most expensive player admits he still finds it surreal to be called a 'Galactico'.

The Wales international left Tottenham for the Spanish capital in September 2013, and has already won a Champions League, Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup in the white of Los Blancos.

It has been quite a rise for the 25-year-old, who admits it still feels odd to be playing for one of the world's biggest clubs. He is becoming used to the media attention, but is particularly aware of it during the high-profile training sessions at Valdebebas.

'It is a bit surreal to be called a "Galactico",' Bale told FourFourTwo. 'The one thing you don't want is to be on the end of a nutmeg [at training] - especially with the rows of cameras. 

'We are always getting killed out there and I just try not to let it be me. Whenever someone gets nutmegged, we are all jumping and joking.'

Carlo Ancelotti's side remain top of La Liga, despite a disappointing draw against Villarreal last time out. They will look to get back to winning ways at Athletic Bilbao at the weekend.
