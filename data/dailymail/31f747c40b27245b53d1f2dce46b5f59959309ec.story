An estranged wife has alleged her former husband has taken two expensive paintings from their luxury apartment.

Lydia Astill claims the most substantial item allegedly taken from the property by her husband, Cameron, is the Brett Whiteley painting 'Interior with Bull-Bull Egg Sculpture.

The affluent Gold Coast couple, who are believed to own several exclusive properties together, are now embroiled in a bitter battle over the artworks. 

Ms Astill has told police the couple had yet to decide who would claim the paintings from one of Australia's most influential artists, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

Ms Astill claimed her husband used his keys to slip back into the apartment the couple once shared and take the artworks.

Brett Whiteley is considered one of the most important and influential artists in Australia since World War Two. He won numerous art prizes before his death at 53 from a heroin overdose. 

Last year, Whiteley's painting  My Armchair sold for $3.2 million, making it the the all time second highest price for an Australian painting. 

Gold Coast Chief Superintendent Des Lacy told The Gold Coast Bulletin: 'It appears to be a civil dispute and the fact is you can't steal your own property,' Mr Lacy said.

'They were husband and wife and it seems likely this will be determined by their lawyers.'

Ms Astill was unavailable for comment at the time of publication.
