His brilliant pictures have already won him 11,000 followers and made him Queenland's king of Instagram.

So it's hard to believe that Alex Korica only turned 20 yesterday and is an entirely self-taught photographer who started uploading his pictures to the social media site in January 2013.

His account is now away with eye-wateringly bright photographs of Australia, from stunning seascapes to brilliantly lit inner-city streets. The pictures have seen him lauded as one of Esquire's top travel photographers to follow on Instagram.

Alex Korica captures the many attractions of Australia in vivid photographs posted on Instagram: 'Bird-Cage Alley' in Sydney (officially known as Angel Place) and the glowing interior of St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne

The Brisbane man said Instagram was an outlet for his photography.

'It was always a passion since I was very young, and Instagram started me off,' he said.

'I find a happiness when I can find something I like and find something that someone else likes and make people think differently about it.

'Everyone can see a waterfall but I take that extra step to show people a different angle from what we always see.

'That’s something I’ve always wanted to do as a photographer.'

The 20-year-old also takes shots of street art, including graffiti in Brisbane (left) and Hosier Lane, Melbourne, which are eye-wateringly bright

These shots were taken by setting steel wool on fire and spinning it. The photographer uses a slow shutter speed to capture the whorls of fire

Korica does not like to be pigeon-holed as a landscape photographer but likes to keep his followers in suspense about what he posts.

'I aim to post two photos a day,' he said. 'I don’t like specialising in things, I like to keep my audience in surprise about when I post next. I like landscape, streetscapes and ocean photography, and I’m slowly expanding into portrait photography.'

But the followers didn't come flock easily to Korica. 'It was a slow start and it was shock to me to see numbers growing and growing every single day,' he said.

Korica's favourite photo is one he took at Natural Bridge near Queensland's Gold Coast that got the attention of Tourism Queensland.

'There's a rocky pathway going down hill towards the cave and I took a photograph of the pool and the waterfall stream that lands on a broken log,' he said.

'It captures the atmosphere of the location.'

Now that Korica has sharpened his skills, he has decided to take a step back from Instagram to pursue photography more seriously.

'I would just like to keep it as a passion, I don’t want to lose that passion,' he said.

'I would like to work with Tourism Australia and keep sharing photos with my family, friends and the audience.'

Many images feature the pink and gold drenched skies of Queensland at sunrise and sunset (left) while others make use of reflections on water

'I have a bushwalk that I run through locally, and it's always a comfort to my eyes seeing fallen leaves of all colours on the ground'
