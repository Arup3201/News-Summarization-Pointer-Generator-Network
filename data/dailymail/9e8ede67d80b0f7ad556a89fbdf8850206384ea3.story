Frank Lampard will play for Manchester City's Australian A-League side Melbourne City next season, ahead of his move to Major League Soccer franchise New York City FC.

Lampard will join David Villa for the start of the A-League season in October before the pair move to the MLS next March, when New York City will begin to play.

Lampard's Chelsea contract officially expired on Monday and he has now agreed his long-rumoured move to New York, via Australia.

Having ended his 13-year association with the Blues, Lampard is thought to be reluctant to join another Premier League club despite receiving offers.

He scored 211 goals for the club, making him their all-time record goalscorer, and won three Premier League titles, the Champions League, the Europa League, four FA Cups, two League Cups, and two Community Shields in his time at Stamford Bridge, playing 648 games.

And his former Chelsea team-mate Mark Schwarzer also hinted the Englishman wanted a move to Australia.

He said: 'He did ask me about Melbourne Heart. He did ask me what Melbourne was like and what Melbourne Heart was like.

'I said Sydney was the best place to live! [Where Schwarzer is from] But I spoke very highly of Melbourne. I actually love Melbourne. Itâ€™s a great city. I told him how passionate in particular the Victorians are with their sport.

'There is huge potential in the game in Australia and it would be unbelievable if he went to Australia. I said to him that he would love living there. It's a great place to live.'
