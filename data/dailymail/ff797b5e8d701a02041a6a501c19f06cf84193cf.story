A 56-year-old Long Island man caught driving in a carpool lane alone with a fake passenger told police he has been using dummy for at least a month so he could get to his new job on time.

Furthermore James Campbell, who was pulled over Friday on the Long Island Expressway at Dix Hills at 6.30am, said he intends to use the wooden creation again - and did on his way home later that day.

Suffolk County Highway Patrol officer Jonathan Abrams noticed the fake, and when he approached Campbell's car he said that he needed to see the passenger's identification.

 'I saved my chuckling for after I walked away from their car, and they’re not going to believe this one back at the office,' the officer told CBS New York.

Sorry not sorry: James Campbell, 56, was caught in the HOV lane of the Long Island Expressway using this wooden dummy (right) as his second passenger, and says he's not afraid to do it again

Solid: The prop was made by the driver out of wooden panels, dressed up in a grey hoodie

Defiant: Campbell, who drives a two-seat pickup truck, said he created the dummy to get to his new job on time, and intends to keep using it for that very reason

Abrahams added: 'He didn’t want to be late to work, so he had assembled this thing and kept it in his car so he could use the HOV lane to get to work faster.'

Campbell was issued summonses for speeding and occupancy violation.

However police did not confiscate the dummy.

And, speaking with media Friday night, defiantly said he has not been deterred from using it.

'I used it on the way home!' he laughed to CBS.

'I’ve been using it for months. I think it's fun. I'll change the outfits (for next time).' 

Having a laugh: Despite being issued summonses for speeding and occupancy violation, Campbell said he is not afraid to pull a similar move - and did on his way home on Friday

Could be better: Police said they noticed straight away the dummy was not an actual person 

Officer Abrahams recalled Campbell's behavior different.

'He was definitely ashamed,' Abrahams said.

Abraham's reitered what Campbell was caught doing is illegal, and patrol will remain on the lookout for him after the comments.

Using dummies in HOV - high-occupency vehicle - lanes has been a problem for police all over the country for years, as dressing up dummies in order to drive in the less-populated corridors became popular.
