Christian Benteke is likely to avoid a club fine for his red card against Tottenham after Aston Villa failed in a bid to reduce his three-game ban.

Villa’s Belgian striker was sent off for retaliation against Ryan Mason of Spurs on Sunday and manager Paul Lambert admits he will be speaking to the player about the incident.

But the Villa boss remains adamant that the punishment does not fit the crime, even though the FA disagreed.

Lambert said: ‘I haven’t really had a chat with him about it as there was so much going on but I will speak to him. If I really thought it was a right hook then... but the provoking was definitely there.

‘It’s unfair to say whether I will fine him until I speak to him but it’s very unlikely. I said after the game that I don’t condone what he did but I can understand why he did it. That incident, he got hit twice with it.

‘I think he will learn from it, that you can’t put your hands in anybody’s face. He’s been disappointed. We asked the FA to look at it and it was dismissed.

‘We thought three games was excessive. It was commentated on the television that if Christian has to go then there were other things. We weren’t contesting the sending off but the three games. They (the FA) threw it out.’

Benteke has just returned to the side after recovering from a ruptured Achilles heel. He was called up for the Belgian national squad on Thursday and Lambert is delighted his player will be getting more game time.

‘It’s good he’s picked for the national team to keep up his level of fitness,’ added Lambert. He was looking good on Sunday. I think Tottenham found it hard to contain him.

‘He is getting better and feeling more confident. Right from the off he was right on it.’

Both clubs have also been charged with failing to control their players in the angry fall-out from the match.

Lambert argued: ‘The reaction of the players was normal after one of their team mates was getting that done. Obviously Spurs were involved in it as well.

‘The FA have made up their minds and it looks like the two teams are going to get hit and there’s not much more I can get involved with in that.

‘Human nature will dictate that when one of your team mates is treated like that everybody else will get involved. Both teams did.’
