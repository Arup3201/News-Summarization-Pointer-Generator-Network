A new TV experiment will test the survival skills of a group of volunteers by tossing them back into the Stone Age where they must make fire, forage and hunt while wearing only animal skins.

The eclectic band of men and women, who include a former male model, a farmer and a nightclub owner, will be left in a remote Bulgarian forest for five weeks to battle nature and the elements.

The groundbreaking reality TV show, called 10,000 BC, starts on Channel 5 next week and will treat viewers to plenty of tears and tantrums as the disparate bunch struggle to acclimatise to a Stone Age existence.

Volunteers: The Harding family, five of the 20 participants of Channel 5's new reality TV show 10,000 BC

Some of the volunteers, whose ages range from 20 to 65, arrived in high spirits while texting friends on smartpones - and another turned up in high heels looking immaculate from head to toe.

But any misconceptions they had about their five weeks of fame were soon laid to rest when the group was presented with a freshly slaughtered deer.

The kill was designed to give the volunteers a running start - but for vegetarian Josie O'Rourke, 48, from East Sussex, who's there with her 23-year-old daughter, Jodie, the sight is repulsive.

For the rest of the 20 though, hunger rather than eating preferences becomes the real issue and as starvation sets in, splinters and cracks appear in the group - creating scenes which viewers will no doubt relish.

Harsh conditions: The contestants must survive in Stone Age conditions and will have to make fire, forage and hunt while wearing only animal skins

Struggle: Just two days into the five week experiment, two members of the tribe give up because of heat exhaustion and homesickness

The programme was filmed over two months last autumn in a large but remote forested region of Bulgaria - prone to extreme temperatures and inhabited by dangerous wild boars.

By 10,000 BC, humans had a range of technologies to aid them in their exploitation of the environment, most importantly the ability to make fire.

The hunter-gatherer people of 10,000 BC used stone, wood, bone and antlers for their weapons and implements. 

Some groups practiced primitive mining, or more strictly quarrying, for flint, digging shallow pits and trenches.

People wore clothing made from animal skins, which they sewed together using intricately-crafted bone needles. 

They had mastered the use of cords and threads fashioned from plant materials to aid them in making their clothes as well as for making baskets.

Their weaponry included spears, bows and arrows, and harpoons.

People rarely lived past 30.

For their first two days in the wildnerness the participants are given tips by survival expert Klint Janulis, before being left to fend for themselves.

Before he leaves, two of the group have already surrendered to heat exhaustion and homesickness - less than than 48 hours after their adventure began.

'As well as being about survival this is a social experiment,' says Janulis.

'We will discover how they work together and make decisions. Some of them arrived thinking it was a camping trip.'

The programme attempts to recreate the harsh existence of Stone Age men and women as much as possible.

During this period in human history, hunter-gatherers were required to roam miles to find food and use flints tools.

The TV show does allow some modern necessities such as sturdy hiking boots but the group still struggles to adapt - with the lighting of a fire presenting the biggest issue in episode one.

A few hours later and the group have still not managed it - and as the light begins to fade, the rain sets in and dampens spirits even more.

The participants must live in basic-looking huts with no soap or cleaning products - and many admit to possessing no practical skills that will help them to survive over the five weeks.

'I was born in the 1970s but that was 10,000 years too late,' says astute 41-year-old lorry driver Paul Barnes, from Bristol.

As the show goes on, cliques develop, a leader is chosen and the group struggle to cope with daytime heat, mosquitoes and lack of hygiene.

Disputes break out as some members of the tribe fail to pull their weight and in one moment of desperate hunger, the discarded maggot-ridden remains of the earlier deer are dusted down and eaten.

Summarising the programme on their website, Channel 5 say: 'These men and women will be going back to basics – big time. They'll be hunting animals, foraging for food, subsisting on whatever they can scour from their environment. 

'They'll be cold, hungry, scared and pushed to the limits of endurance. They'll have no one but themselves and each other to help get them through. 

'How will they fare? What will this demanding, exhilarating experience make them (and the audience at home) realise about 21st century life?'

The group's ages range from 20 to 65. Above, oldest contestant Caroline Mortimer (L) and Tom Reader (R)

'This programme is about exchanging modern life for a prehistoric one and to take stock of how our lives have changed. Has it all been for the better? 

'Either way, it’ll be a highly emotionally charged roller coaster ride….tears, tantrums, laughter and joy, every day, 24/7.'

10,000 BC will be aired on Monday and Tuesday at 10pm on Channel 5.
