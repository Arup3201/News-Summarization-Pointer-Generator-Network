Baking queen: Mary Berry admitted she sometimes buys ready-made pastry to save time

Any competitor who dared to take such a short-cut would see their chances of winning disappear in a puff of, well, pastry.

But it seems even the Great British Bake Off judges are guilty of the occasional kitchen cheat.

Mary Berry has confessed that she and fellow judge Paul Hollywood sometimes resort to using ready-made pastry – because making it from scratch ‘takes a long time’.

And as if that wasn’t enough, the queen of baking also revealed she has been known to whip up cakes from supermarket packet mixes.

As she set the contestants the challenge of making their own strudel on last week’s show, Mrs Berry, 77, hinted that she sometimes buys prepared filo pastry.

But the cookery writer has now added a sprinkling of extra detail, admitting: ‘Seriously I wouldn’t dream of making filo pastry because it would take me a long time.

‘And Paul doesn’t make it either. It’s very thin. I made it at college and know the principles.

'It was an excellent challenge to have on the programme because it is something really difficult and they had the time, but if I’m at home I’m very, very busy, I have other things to do.

‘I can buy it for £2 in a packet and buy a good one. I don’t want to spend hours on one thing. I would not make puff pastry, I buy the all butter puff pastry, and it’s good.’

She also admitted that she has used shop-bought cake mixes in the past, but said she prefers to weigh out her own ingredients.

Mrs Berry has published more than 70 
cookery books and trained at Le Cordon Bleu school in France, while Mr 
Hollywood, 46, was head baker at The Dorchester in London and his 
artisan bread company now supplies clients such as Harrods.

The pair’s BBC show has attracted more than four million viewers and turned Mrs Berry into an unlikely TV star, with a documentary series now being made about her life.

Speaking at the Cake and Bake Show at Earls Court, she said: ‘I must now be the oldest person on a cooking programme.

'You don’t need to be somebody young and often they don’t have experience that I have.’
