A wounded war veteran has described the moment security agents treated him like a 'terrorist' on a recent trip to California because he couldn't raise his injured right arm in a full-body scanner and his dress uniform contained 'too much metal.'

Cpl. Nathan Kemnitz was awarded a Purple Heart after he almost died in 2004 from an injury incurred from a roadside bomb in Fallujah, Iraq. The brave soldier recently traveled to Sacramento, California to receive another award as his district's veteran of the year.

But, what should have been a celebratory experience was tainted when suspicious security workers at both the Sacramento International Airport and the California State Capitol Buildings subjected him to intense screenings and even ordered him to take off his uniform.

Because of the injury Kemnitz suffered in the blast, he can't lift his right arm above his head, which has made getting through security lines increasingly difficult.

'At some places I'm treated like royalty and at some like a terrorist. There's got to be something in the middle,' he said.

Two recent trips through the secuirty line landed closer to the 'terrorist' side of treatment. When a TSA officer asked him to raise his arms above his head in a full-body scanner, he refused.

'My right arm doesn't work. It's a lot of hassle for me to do that,' Kemnitz told Military Times.

Screeners
 then continued to prod Kemnitz, looking under his metals, running their
 hands under his waistband and swabbing his shoes for explosives. 

His traveling partner, Patricia Martin, found the whole incident disturbing, and took pictures of the humiliating screening.

'What
 does the uniform and heroism represent if our own citizens - in this 
case employees of the TSA and security personnel - have no regard for 
them?' Martin wrote to Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki about 
the incident.

TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein issued a statement Monday concerning the incident.

'Our intent is to treat all injured service members and veterans with the dignity they deserve, As always, all passengers with disabilities and medical conditions are eligible for screening procedures sensitive to their particular disability, medical condition or other unique medical circumstance.

'Transportation Security Officers have
 to resolve any anomaly detected at the checkpoint,' Feinstein said.

'As
 is standard procedure for all passengers, if travelers alarm when 
passing through a metal detector or an advanced imaging technology (AIT)
 unit, additional screening is required in order to resolve that 
anomaly.'

Following similar incidents with 
other wounded veterans, the TSA recently changed it's rules so injured 
troops no longer need to remove their shoes, jackets or hats in 
security. 

They also 
offer an expedited service, but you must call the agencies Military 
Severely Injured Joint Service Operations Center prior to traveling.

Guests: Senator John McCain visited the young man in hospital after he returned from Iraq

There
 is also a 'curb-to-gate' service for injured personnel and well as a 
pre-check program for military personnel at four airports.

Kemnitz
 wasn't so bothered by the TSA screening as he was by the 'rude' and 
'unapologetic' security screener at the California state capitol.

He was visiting the capitol as a veteran being honored in his district, but the Senate Sergent-At-Arms screening him didn't cut him any slack when the metal detector went off.

The screener asked him to take off his dress blue blouse 'because he was wearing too much metal.' That started an argument between Kemnitz, Martin and the security screener.

Representatives at the California state capitol have yet to release a statement about the incident.
