A wealthy Russian who survived an attempt on his life in London cannot be extradited to face murder charges in Moldova because it would breach his human rights.

A judge at Westminster Magistrates Court ruled that Moldovan authorities had failed to give assurances that German Gorbuntsov, 48, would not be tortured in their custody.

Mr Gorbuntsov said after the hearing that he believes there is a half-million-pound contract on his life. In 2012 an assassin shot him six times outside his flat in Docklands.

German Gorbuntsov outside court today: He will not be extradited to face charges of ordering a contract killing in Moldova after a judge ruled that the country's authorities had failed to guarantee he would not be tortured

Moldovan prosecutors accuse Mr Gurbuntsov of ordering the contract killing of a rival businessman in a fight for control of a bank worth more than £5million.

He was detained on a European Arrest Warrant but today a judge ruled he could remain in Britain because the former Soviet republic could not guarantee he would not be subjected to torture or degrading or inhumane treatment.

After the decision, Mr Gorbuntsov, speaking through a translator, told reporters: 'The English Court made the right decision.

'I can say one thing, the justice system in Great Britain is straight forward and fair. Investigators and detectives did more than I had hoped.

'But the threat is still there. It was a Moldovan person with eight bullets that tried to kill me.

'The Moldovan government has declared that they will pay £500,000 if somebody will bring me in a body bag.

Living in fear: Mr Gorbuntsov came out of hiding to attend court today accompanied by his partner, Natalia Semchenkova, pictured left, and bodyguards

'The man who tried to have me killed is now a presidential candidate in Moldova, he could be the most powerful man in the country.

'The man who shot me has been arrested, he is now in Romania where he is accused of other murders.

'Three weeks ago I had a serious operation to help heal the injuries from the attempt on my life, I have been left with a 70cm scar on my stomach.

'Now we will go to celebrate and I will continue my treatment.

'I plan to stay here in the UK, I have a family here and I have children here but this has effected everything, my life, my business.

'I am under police protection, I am paying for it out of my own money, but it is dangerous to go out in public. I still fear for my life, of course.'

Mr Gorbuntsov's past is not well known. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he made a fortune operating banks in Russia and Moldova and set up nearly 40 companies involved in security, construction, real estate and finance.

He fled to Britain in 2010, following the attempted murder of another financier, Alexander Antonov, in Moscow - a crime in which he was implicated but of which he has consistently maintained his innocence.

In March 2012, Mr Gorbuntsov had just stepped from a taxi outside his Docklands apartment black when a would-be assassin emerged frm the shadows.

He was shot six times with an automatic pistol before he was able to punch the code in the front door lock and leap behind a wall just a few feet from the entrance.

Since the attempt on his life, which he claims was ordered by the same men who arranged the attack on Mr Antonov, he has lived in a secret location under armed police guard.

He broke cover to attend court today accompanied by his partner, Natalia Semchenkova, and bodyguards.

Moldovan prosecutors allege that Mr Gorbuntsov ordered the contract killing of Renat Usatiy who had bought a stake in Universal Bank in Moldova for £1.2 million at a time when Mr Gorbuntsov was facing debt problems.

According to Mr Usatiy, who spoke to the Mail on Sunday about the claims last year, Mr Gorbuntsov accused him of trying to steal the bank from under his nose.

When Mr Usatiy refused to give up his investment, he claims Mr Gorbuntsov ordered his assassination.

'Fearful of what could happen, I increased my security and brought my armoured car from Moscow to Chisinau [the Moldovan capital], and went to the police,' he said.

Westminster Magistrates Court: Ben Lloyd, representing the Moldovan Government, was unable to tell the court why a letter from prosecutors had failed to address the issues surrounding Mr Gorbuntzov's human rights

Flanked by a uniformed police officer, the Mr Gorbuntsov stood in the dock today wearing a grubby black t-shirt and black tracksuit pants, speaking only to confirm his name through an interpreter.

Alun Jones QC, representing Mr Gorbuntsov, said Moldovian authorities had failed to provide written assurances they would respect article three of the European Convention of Human Rights, as had been required by a previous hearing.

Article three prohibits, without exceptions of limitations, torture and 'inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment' - a human right which applies 'irrespective of a victim's conduct', courts have ruled.

Mr Jones said experts had given evidence about the appalling conditions in Moldovan prisons.

'The Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said that the CPS and the requesting authority should provide evidence to rebut it, if not [the extradition request] would be dismissed,' he said.

British prosecutors had received correspondence from the Moldovan authorities, but Mr Jones said: 'We didn't hear anything until yesterday until a letter arrived yesterday.

'It is a dummy letter, it does not do anything at all, it does not address the issues.

'Mr Gorbuntsov has spent much of the month of June in hospital after undergoing a serious operation, we have been to this court now for four weeks.

'Our submission is the case should now be thrown out and discharged immediately.'

Ben Lloyd, representing the Moldovan Government, was unable to tell the court why the letter had failed to address the issues surrounding Mr Gorbuntzov's human rights.

He said: 'I don't make a submission that this is a significant document, I think that is all I can say.'

Making his ruling Judge Ikram said: 'There have been three cases previously where Article Three has been raised in relation to the Republic of Moldova.

'There has been no evidence to rebut the evidence in relation to conditions within prisons in that country.

'A letter was received by those who act for the requesting authority that seems to be a recital of the law and does not, it seems to be considered by all parties, deal with the issue in hand.

'I must come to the same conclusion and therefore based on the evidence that has been accepted by this court on previous hearings I come to the view that the Warrant should be discharged.

'You are free to go.'

There was applause from the public gallery, while Gorbuntzov looked confused as a Russian interpreter explained that he had been freed.

Mr Gorbuntzov's lawyers applied for some of his costs to be paid by the British government.
