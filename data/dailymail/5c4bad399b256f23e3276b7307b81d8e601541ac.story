Police have confirmed that a 911 call claiming to have been made from inside the Miami Beach home of rapper Lil Wayne on Wednesday reporting four people had been shot was a hoax.

A major contingent of police and SWAT surrounded the expansive $9.4 million property at 94 Largorce Circle after the call was placed at 12.40pm.

Officials said a man called Miami Police Department saying he had shot four people and 'requested assistance'.  

According to WSVN,  the 32-year-old performer - real name Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr. - is in Miami today but was not at home at the time of the incident.

Officers entered the 10-bedroom waterfront and inspected each room, soon declaring it all-clear and establishing the report a sham.
