Britain is free to ban foreign doctors if they cannot speak English or there are concerns about their professional ability, an EU Commissioner said today.

Michel Barnier said it was a myth that rules in Brussels require the UK to employ EU doctors without evidence that their language and medical skills are of an acceptable standard.

The issue of foreign doctors' language ability became a national issue two years ago when German-trained GP Dr Daniel Ubani killed British pensioner David Gray, 70, by giving him 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine.

Dr Ubani, who was on his first out of hours shift in the UK, said he was confused about the difference between drugs used here and in Germany.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, Mr Barnier, commissioner for the internal market, insisted: 'Doctors' suitability for the role they will be performing should be properly scrutinised by those who will be employing them.

'Patients are obviously right to insist that those treating them can communicate properly.

'Language checks are not explicitly imposed by EU law. But neither are they outlawed. The Commission has never understood why the UK imposed a strict ban on language ability checks.'

Mr Barnier's comments came after it emerged last week that fewer than one in ten hospitals check whether nurses from Europe can adequately speak English before letting them work on wards.

Language problems often only come to light when patients find that their requests for more pain relief or different food are not understood, according to an NHS watchdog.

The Department of Health and the Royal College of Nursing have told hospitals it is their responsibility to make adequate checks but the guidance is not always passed on to managers in charge of recruitment.

Foreign nurses coming to work in England from outside the EU have to undergo rigorous English exams that last up to five hours before they can join the NMC register.

Today David Gray's son Rory described the EU Commissioner's comments 
as 'dangerous', as he believes it is not always possible for individual 
employers to carry out background checks.

Rory Gray said he believes a single, national medical regulator like the General Medical Council should take charge of background checks on doctors, as they are in a better position to do so than individual hospitals.

Mr Gray told MailOnline: 'It is obviously much safer to have the single national medical regulator be allowed to check all EU doctors' competency at the point of registration, exaclty like they do for non-EEA doctors.

'The GMC have the know-how, resources, capability and vast experience of doing this.

'To leave it to each of hundreds of doctors' employers around the country to carry out the checks as they see fit has been a deadly failure.

'Some employers will no doubt perform adequate checks but inevitably others will not.'

Foreign nurses coming to work in England from outside the EU have to undergo rigorous English exams that last up to five hours before they can join the NMC register.

But fewer than one in ten NHS trusts are bothering to set their own tests or demand to see proof that nurses have reached an appropriate standard of English, according to Freedom of Information requests obtained by the Daily Mail.

Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons and Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, say 'urgent action' is needed to combat 'huge variations' in the quality and training of foreign doctors.
