Wigan's players have offered to pay half of the cost of away tickets for their trip to Leeds on Boxing Day after fans complained about the prices set by the Whites.

Numerous Latics supporters contacted their club with complaints about the fees for the game at Elland Road, which are currently priced at £36 for advanced sales and go up to £41 on the day.

Wigan's own players have now stepped in to offer financial aid for that Sky Bet Championship fixture on December 26 by paying 50 per cent on the first 500 advance tickets sold.

Wigan have struggled in the Championship this season and are currently in the relegation zone in 23rd place

Wigan fans complained to the club that the prices to watch the club at Leeds on Boxing Day was too much

'Christmas is an expensive time of year for everyone, especially football fans, and we want to show our appreciation to the fans who follow us week-in, week-out by making this gesture,' said club captain Gary Caldwell.

'To have the fans behind us is a massive boost for the players and we know that we haven't been able to give them as much back this season as we want. If this helps to get them to Elland Road and give us their support then we are glad we can help.'

Chief executive Jonathan Jackson added: 'It's a lovely one-off gesture by the players and I hope very much the fans take up their offer because we need as many supporters there as possible.

Wigan manager Malky Mackay has endured a torrid start to his tenure and is yet to record a victory

'It is a situation we do not have any control over as a club as it is the decision of every home club to set match-day ticket prices for their own stadium and it is not up to us to comment upon that.

'But it demonstrates once more how the players genuinely appreciate the support they receive from our fans.'
