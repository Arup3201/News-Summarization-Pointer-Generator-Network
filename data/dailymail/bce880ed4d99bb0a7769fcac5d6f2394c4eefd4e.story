Ilham Aliyev was declared the winner of the Azerbaijan's presidential elections a day before voting began

The winner of Azerbaijan's presidential election was announced a day before voting began.

The country's Central Election Commission released the result of Wednesday's vote on Tuesday, showing President Ilham Aliyev had won 73 per cent of the vote.

It was published on the commission's smartphone app.

The commission explained the gaffe by 
saying that a software developer had released the figures as a 'test' at
one polling station. It apologized for the 'misunderstanding.' 

Official results on Thursday showed Aliyev, whose family has been at the helm of this oil-rich Caspian Sea nation for four decades, winning nearly 85 per cent of the vote.

His
closest challenger, main opposition candidate Jamil Hasanli, trailed 
with less than 6 per cent, followed by eight fringe candidates, 
according to the commission.

Monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSEC) in Europe blasted Wednesday's election as flawed, saying it lacked a 'level playing field for candidates.'

It 
cited detentions, criminal prosecutions, reports of physical attacks and
other pressure on journalists as well as disproportionate media 
coverage of the president.

It reported ballot-box stuffing in 37 polling
stations and called the vote counting practices 'overwhelmingly 
negative.'

Hasanli has demanded a new vote.

Following Wednesday's election, Aliyev
said in a TV address: 'Azerbaijan will continue successfully to develop
as a democratic country.

'The fact that this election was free and transparent is another serious step towards democracy.'

Aliyev's victory follows years of what rights groups describe as a relentless campaign to harass government critics.

It
also reflects his popularity, which has been buoyed by oil riches that 
have more than tripled Azerbaijan's economy and filtered down even to 
its poorest citizens.

He came to power in 2003 when he succeeded his father, Geidar Aliyev, who ruled 
Azerbaijan for most of the previous three decades, first as the 
Soviet-era Communist Party boss and then as its post-Soviet president. 

Transparency International, a global 
anti-corruption watchdog, says Azerbaijan is plagued by endemic 
corruption that hampers its development and prevents the population from
sharing in the country's oil wealth.

It ranked Azerbaijan 143 out of 
183 countries in its 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index.

The
country has also been critized by Human Rights Watch, which said a 
crackdown on dissent specifically targeted youth groups after the Arab 
Spring uprisings.
