Ed Miliband today tried to distance himself from New Labour’s vile culture of spin and smears.

He insisted he had never been engaged in the sort of ‘reprehensible’ briefings against colleagues exposed in the memoirs of disgraced Gordon Brown spin doctor Damian McBride.

And he insisted it was not in his nature to take part in such behaviour, claiming: ‘I am not sure I have ever been accused of being macho.’

Pressure: With the Labour conference dominated by revelations from the McBride memoirs, leader Ed Miliband tried to distance himself from the parties past

Critics will claim that this latest 
allegation underlines the public interest in the amoral political world 
in which Mr Brown’s spin doctor operated

The Labour party conference in Brighton risks being dominated by the McBride memoirs, which have lifted the lid on the relentless in-fighting, briefings and smears which dominated the last government.

The scandal risks reminding voters of Mr Miliband’s role as a close lieutenant of Mr Brown, alongside shadow chancellor Ed Balls.

This weekend Mr Balls admitted he was part of a blokeish culture which damaged Labour.

He told The Times: 'The period up to 1997 and after, yes, it was macho. I look back on that as a time we were young and inexperienced.

'It was something both [Blair and Brown] allowed to happen. It was a mistake and it was damaging to the government.'

But Mr Miliband today insisted he had urged Mr Brown to sack Mr McBride amid suspicions about his behaviour, which he said were ‘not my kind of politics’.

The police could be called in to investigate whether Damian McBride broke the law when leaking government secretes, former No.10 spin chief Alastair Campbell has suggested.

He accused Mr McBride, Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor, of having ‘admitted not just to venality but criminality’.

Mr Campbell added: ‘I think the other thing that people should be aware of is he [McBride] has admitted to criminal offences in this.’

In his memoir, Mr McBride confesses to logging into Mr Brown’s official email account in the Treasury.

He also admits leaking details of restricted and confidential documents.

Labour frontbenchers said that Mr Miliband read the riot act to the first meeting of his shadow cabinet, insisting anyone caught briefing against colleagues would be fired.

Mr Miliband insisted that he now led a ‘unified’ party. During an appearance on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Miliband was asked whether he could ‘look into your heart during that period and say to yourself that you were completely clean’.

He replied: ‘I think that people who know me would say that I am someone who has never engaged in the factionalism and was never engaged in the briefing.

‘That wasn't my style of politics. It has never been my style of politics and I find it reprehensible and not something I would engage in.

‘I am someone who is deeply committed to the Labour Party and deeply committed to Britain and that is the way I have always approached my politics.’

However Mr McBride's account of vicious Labour in-fighting, serialised in the Mail, has cast a shadow over the party's conference.

In particular serious questions have been raised about Mr Brown’s failure to act to stop the behaviour.

Ex-cabinet minister Dame Tessa Jowell said Mr Brown must publicly state that he did not know about the activities of Mr McBride or have his own reputation tarnished. She says she is ‘sure’ Mr Miliband was aware of his activities.

Dame Tessa, who claimed to be a victim of smears from Mr Brown's faction, told the Mail on Sunday: ‘Gordon is not an innocent, it is inconceivable he did not know what Damian was doing. Damian clearly felt it was implicitly sanctioned.’

Mr Brown should be ‘ashamed’ of employing Mr McBride. He must disown him – or suffer the consequences.

‘In the absence of a very clear statement by Gordon that he didn’t know about it, it damages his reputation. Only Gordon can deal with that.’

‘If he refused, it would destroy the credit given to him for rescuing the country during the banking collapse.’

Energy firms will be banned from increasing prices while making huge profits under a plan to be unveiled by Labour this week.

Ed Miliband will take on gas and electric firms to stop them ripping off customers.

Companies will also be forced to pass on savings when wholesale prices fall.

Up to 4million pensioners will be automatically put on the cheapest tariff in a move which could save them up to £200 a year each.

Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: 'People are sick and tired of paying over the odds.'

Senior Labour figures lined up to distance themselves - and their leader- from the McBride revelations.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, whose husband Ed Balls was a key Brownite, said Mr McBride was 'out of control'.

She told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'I think this is ... about a kind of politics that really is appalling, that we should never go back to.

'It is something that happened some years ago, but I think it's a sign of how much the Labour Party has changed, the very different climate, the very different way in which Ed Miliband is managing things and operating things now, that's a good thing, we don't want to go back to the navel gazing of the past.'

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said of the ex-spin doctor: 'He's a relic from the past. There is no place for that kind of nasty, vile politics in Britain today. I am glad we've seen the back of him.'

He said he was at a shadow cabinet meeting where Mr Miliband was 'very clear he will not tolerate any of that kind of behaviour'.

'If anyone is found to be briefing against anybody you will be out, there's no discussion. That's not the way Ed Miliband does things," he told a fringe meeting organised by the New Statesman magazine.

'If any good comes from Damian McBride's indulgence, it's to remind people that that's not the way we do things.

'Everybody who was around then, and is still around, knows how damaging that was. Think how much more we could have achieved if so much energy had not been expended on this nonsense.'
