William Thomas, 69, was told he had a harmless cyst on his arm when, actually, he had aggressive skin cancer

Doctors have been berated for wrongly diagnosing a patient’s cancerous tumour as a large, harmless cyst.

William Thomas, 69, went to see his GP, Dr Juliana Hood, in Borth, Ceredigion, mid-Wales, in June 2012 with a lump on his arm - the same arm on which he’d had a cancer scare in 1995.

He returned to the surgery nine weeks later and Dr Ian Hosker could find no record of his previous visit. 

Rather than make an urgent referral, the doctor diagnosed him with a ganglion - a 
harmless lump filled with fluid - and gave him a standard referral to attend 
the local hospital four weeks later.

However, Mr Thomas knocked the lump, 
which had grown to the size of an egg, while at work.

When it didn't stop bleeding, he went to A&E, where he was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer.

Mr Thomas, a builder, said: 'The 
doctors at A&E said it was urgent and sent me to Gobowen hospital 
the next day for a biopsy. After examining it, they had to do an 
emergency operation to remove it.'

The
 lump was Merkel cell carcinoma, a very rare and aggressive form
 of skin cancer. Its removal has left Mr Thomas barely able to work due 
to loss of power and function in his right arm.

His daughter, Mandy Daniel, said: 'The look on my dad’s face when they said it was a cancerous 
tumour will never leave me - he was petrified. It’s been a horrific time
 for the family.'

After the family complained, the Public Service Ombudsman for Wales ruled that the doctors treating Mr Thomas were guilty of serious failings.  

Mr Thomas was awarded £750 compensation for the errors that led to a delay in his skin cancer diagnosis last year.

His daughter was given £200 for the way her initial complaint was handled.

Ombudsman
 Carys Williams found the first consultation was not recorded, that Mr 
Thomas should have been seen by the practice’s minor surgery clinic 
sooner given his previous cancer scare, and that opportunities were lost
 to diagnose him sooner.

'The failure here was in not referring Mr Thomas sooner, albeit I find that ultimately this only made two weeks difference,' she said. 'However, there were some fundamental and serious failures in record keeping.'

Drs Hood and Hosker were told to apologise for their failings.

In her report to the Ombudsman, Dr Hood said she had already closed the computer record on Mr Thomas when his arm was discussed and that she forgot to enter the details afterwards.

She said she was 'horrified' to learn of his diagnosis and was unable to sleep or eat for some time after, eventually leaving the practice.

Dr Hood has personally written to Mr Thomas’ daughter, apologising.

Dr Hosker said he was convinced the lump was a ganglion, which was why he had not made an urgent referral.

He said: 'This has been a distressing time for Mr Thomas and his family and I can apologise for this.'

Jacqui Jones Brown, practice manager of Borth Surgery, declined to comment.
