The man who shot First Amendment advocate and Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt is scheduled to be executed in Missouri next month - much to the dismay of the longtime porn-peddler.

Mr. Flynt - who was paralyzed from the waist down as a result of the shooting - doesn't want the state to execute Joseph Paul Franklin, the suspected shooter and convicted serial killer. Rather, Mr. Flynt 'would love an hour in a room with him and a pair of wire-cutters and pliers.'

Mr. Flynt says he wants to ' inflict the same damage on him that he inflicted on me,' but that he doesn't think the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for Mr. Franklin - or anyone else.

Victim: Larry Flynt says he doesn't to see the man who shot him put to death

Killer: Joseph Paul Franklin is suspected of shooting Flynt and has been convicted of murdering six people

'As I see it, the sole motivating factor behind the death penalty is 
vengeance, not justice, and I firmly believe that a government that 
forbids killing among its citizens should not be in the business of 
killing people itself,' Mr. Flynt wrote in an article published in The Hollywood Reporter.

Mr. Franklin was never convicted of shooting Flynt. However, he confessed to the shooting, and the majority of law enforcement officials involved in the case - as well as Mr. Flynt - believe he is telling the truth.

Mr. Franklin - a self-described racist - said his motive for shooting Flynt was retribution for publishing images of interracial sex in Hustler.

Interracial relationships were the prime motivation for the majority of the killings during Mr. Franklin's four-year crime spree, which stretched from 1976 to his arrest in 1980.

In all, Mr. Franklin was convicted of six murders, but he has confessed to eight. Law enforcement officials, however, believe he could be involved in more than 20.

In addition to the murders, Mr. Franklin has confessed to the fire-bombings of multiple synagogues.

Mr. Flynt isn't Mr. Franklin's only high-profile victim - in 1980, he shot Vernon Jordan, a civil rights activist and adviser to President Bill Clinton.

After his arrest, Mr. Franklin told investigators that he had planned to kill President Jimmy Carter and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. He said he opted not to kill Mr. Jackson after determining that his security detail would make it too difficult.

Many of Mr. Franklin's murders were sniper attacks from distances up to 1,000 feet. He meticulously planned the murders to ensure that he could escape without a trace. He was arrested when he was selling blood in Florida and a nurse noticed a large eagle tattoo on his arm that had been publicized as belonging to the suspect in several murders.

Mr. Franklin currently is serving six life sentences. His death sentence was handed down in the murder of Gerald Gordon, a Jewish man who was leaving a synagogue when Mr. Franklin shot him and two others.

Mr. Franklin is scheduled to be executed on November 20.
