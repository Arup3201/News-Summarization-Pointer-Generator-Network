An Oregon woman has been awarded more than $18million after taking a major credit reporting agency to court.

A jury awarded Julie Miller more than $18.5 million this week after suing over errors in her credit report leading to denials of credit. Ms. Miller contacted Equifax eight times between 2009 and 2011 trying to rectify the mistakes. The jury awarded Ms. Miller $18.4million in punitive damages and $180,000 in compensatory damages.

Mistakes included erroneous accounts and collection attempts, the wrong Social Security number and birthday, according to a copy of the lawsuit reviewed by MailOnline.

Mistaken identity: An Oregon jury award Julie Miller over $18million after Equifax failed to correct errors in her credit report after eight attempts to contact the agency over the course of two years

‘There was damage to her reputation, a breach of her privacy and the lost opportunity to seek credit,’ said Portland attorney Justin Baxter. ‘She has a brother who is disabled and who can't get credit on his own, and she wasn't able to help him.’

Ms. Miller claims in the suit that she discovered the mangled mess made of her credit report after being denied credit by a local bank in December 2009. She reached out to Equifax and complied with multiple requests for forms and additional information only to have her efforts repeatedly go nowhere. Additional efforts to obtain copies of her credit report also proved unsuccessful.

Credit reporting bureaus are required by federal law to provide consumers a free copy of their credit report annually.

‘After approximately two years of disputing, [Ms. Miller] gave up and filed this lawsuit,’ the suit states.

Other credit reporting companies with similar errors promptly corrected the problem, Mr. Baxter said, adding that the information from another ‘Julie Miller’ had been placed in the wrong record by mistake. Ms. Miller’s financial information was even sent to a firm requesting information about another Julie Miller, Mr. Baxter added.

An Equifax spokesperson declined to comment on the award, which will likely be appealed.

A 2013 Federal Trade Commission study showed that 21 per cent of consumers who review their credit reports find errors, with five per cent of those errors being severe enough to lead to credit being denied.
