Romanian President Traian Basescu said emigration was good for his country

Romanian immigration is a good thing because it reduces unemployment – in Romania, the country’s president has said.

Traian Basescu said the number of jobless Romanians leaving for Britain was ‘helping us very much’.

Mr Basescu attempted to ease concerns over the number of immigrants arriving in the UK. He said many would return to Romania when wages in Eastern Europe started to match those in Britain.

He said: ‘We would be happy to have them back – probably as soon as the wages from Romania be more close to wages in the UK, or in France or in Italy or in Spain.’

Wages in Romania average around £420 a month – less than a quarter of the £2,000 a month take home pay in the UK.

The latest figures show 28,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nations arrived in Britain in the 12 months to the end of March – more than double the previous year’s influx of 12,000.

Border restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians were lifted on January 1 this year – allowing migrants from the two countries to move to the UK for work.

The number of people in Britain from the two former Communist states now stands at 177,000 – more than five times the level seven years ago.

But Basescu said: ‘The reality that a part of Romanian peoples decide to find more work outside of Romania is something helping us very much – maintaining the unemployment at a reasonable rate.'

He said the money sent back by Romanian workers had supported the economy, saying: ‘During the crisis period the remittances for Romania practically kept our foreign trade balance calibrated.’

The president said migrants from his country are not reliant on state benefits, and are determined to pay their own way in life.

‘I’d like it to be understood, as soon as the Romanian economic conditions allow we will be ready to invite them back. Romania needs these people,’ he told BBC Radio 4.

‘They are people who understand the state is not the one that has the obligation – like during the Communist regime – to take care for the life of each one.’
