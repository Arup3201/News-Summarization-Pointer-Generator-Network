Its rugged beauty provided the perfect setting for Emily Bronte’s classic novel Wuthering Heights.

But Thornton Moor’s future remained uncertain last night as plans for a £12million wind farm moved a step closer.

Councillors controversially agreed to allow a 60metre data-gathering mast to be installed on the greenbelt land.

Campaigners now fear the scheme could go before planning officials by September and be built within three years. It would see four 328ft turbines placed next to a hugely popular tourist trail.

The site is less than five miles from Haworth in West Yorkshire, where Emily lived with sisters Charlotte and Anne.

The siblings all enjoyed the moor’s breathtaking views during their walks from the parsonage where they lived – and which is now a museum to them.

Sally McDonald, chairman of the Brontë Society which maintains the museum, has condemned the proposed wind farm as ‘skyline pollution in an area of international historical interest’.

Last night the Bronte Society said: ‘This decision demonstrates a regrettable lack of consideration for a heritage landscape which is unique.’

She added: ‘These moors should continue undisturbed for generations to come and for the swathes of visitors from the UK and overseas drawn to Haworth and Yorkshire by their interest in the lives and works of the Brontës.

‘The moorland hugely influenced the writing of all three sisters. Wuthering Heights was set in and around that area.’ She said the turbines would have a ‘huge visual impact’.

And Phil Dyke, of private green energy firm Banks Renewables, said the wind farm could produce enough electricity for up to 4,400 homes a year and create 50 jobs.

Mother-of-two Anthea Orchard, 34, chairman of the Thornton Moor Wind Farm Action Group, said: The damage to the landscape is going to be irreparable. It is behind a smoke screen of renewable energy.

‘We are also concerned about the impact on wildlife because of how close it is to the South Pennines Site of Special Scientific Interest.
