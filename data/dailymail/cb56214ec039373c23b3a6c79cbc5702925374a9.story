A party of 22 alleged Nazi fanatics have gone on trial in Italy for celebrating Hitler's birthday in a bar

A group of 22 alleged Nazi fanatics have gone on trial in Italy for throwing a party to celebrate Hitler’s birthday.

The festivities included singing songs celebrating the death of Anne Frank and the Jews, investigators say.

The group are accused of propaganda and inciting ethnic and racial hatred.

The alleged party in April 2007 was thrown in a popular beer garden on the picturesque shores of Lake Buguggiate, in the foothills of the Alps.

Among the accused is the owner of the bar Franco Lattuada, a local councillor in Silvio Berlusconi's People of Liberty party. He denies that the party took place.

The revellers allegedly sang bastardised versions of traditional Italian songs with shocking refrains such as ‘Six million Jews, do it again,’ as well as Heil Hitler.

They also sang hymns to notorious Nazis including fomer SS officer Erich Priebke who was convicted of taking part in Italy’s most emotional war crime, the massacre of 335 Italians in the Ardeantine caves outside Rome in 1944.

Undercover police filmed inside the bar, which normally serves German-style sausage and beer, on hidden cameras. The footage, described by the prosecution as ‘shocking’, will be broadcast in the courtroom during the trial.

Officers also seized propaganda leaflets, and other Nazi paraphernalia including pictures of Hitler, Nazi flags, posters from the fascist era and a dagger.

Police are thought to have been extra 
vigilant because celebrations of the Fuhrer’s birthday have often been 
linked to violent attacks.

In 2011 a gang of neo-Nazis in Russia were convicted of raping and dismembering a suspected police informant while celebrating the grim anniversary.

Neo-Nazism has surged in Italy in the last decade largely due to the growing threat from Islamic terrorism.

Extreme right Greek party Golden Dawn last month launched an Italian branch, Alba Dorata, announcing that it intended to stand in February’s general election in Italy.
