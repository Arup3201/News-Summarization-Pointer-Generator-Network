Graham Parker took part in a trial using stem cells to repair heart damage

A major new trial is using patients' own stem cells to treat heart 
failure. One  of the first to benefit is Graham Parker, 41, an 
archaeology student from Stanley, County Durham. He tells CAROL DAVIS 
his story.

Working as a supply teacher a few years
 ago, I started feeling exhausted. I couldn't walk more than 50 metres 
without pausing, was constantly breathless and would wake at night 
coughing.

At first I thought it was a cold or flu, or the stress of a
 house move. But my mum, a retired nurse, pointed out I'd been ill for 
two months, and sent me to the doctor.

The GP suspected asthma, and 
gave me an inhaler. But within a week it was worse and I couldn't walk 
more than a few yards without retching.

So I saw a second GP. She didn't say what she thought it was - she called an ambulance instead. I
 was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead, then 
transferred to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle while they ran several 
tests, including an ECG (electrocardiogram) and MRI (magnetic resonance 
imaging) scan.

Doctors explained I had heart failure: part of my 
heart muscle was damaged and the lower pumping chamber had become flabby
 so couldn't pump blood round my body properly. This was why I was so 
exhausted.

It could have been caused by a virus, although sometimes 
it's genetic. But there's no family history of heart disease and I was 
very fit - I was a former policeman - so the diagnosis was a real shock.

I
 left hospital with medication to help my heart, including beta blockers
 to relieve the load on the heart, ACE inhibitors to dilate my blood 
vessels and help the heart pump better, as well as diuretics and 
warfarin to thin the blood and stop it clotting.

The risk with heart
 failure is that blood can pool in the heart's chambers and is more 
likely to clot, which can cause a heart attack.

I had to take six 
months off work, and felt incredibly weak and breathless. As my heart 
was permanently damaged, I had a pacemaker and defibrillator implanted 
the following year to keep my heart beating regularly.

This stopped me getting any worse, but I was still weak. I couldn't run more than ten minutes on the treadmill at the gym.

Stem cells were taken from the bone marrow in Graham's hip, and injected into his heart

I'd
 read online that many heart failure patients die within five years, 
which was a terrifying prospect. So I gave up work and started an 
archaeology degree, which I'd always wanted to do.

Then, in June 
2009 I read in Good Health about a woman with a damaged heart valve 
who'd had a new treatment in Germany to have stem cells injected into 
the valve to repair it.

A trial using stem cells to treat heart 
failure was starting at the London Chest Hospital and I asked to join 
it. The doctors explained that stem cells can potentially grow into any 
cell, including heart muscle cells, for reasons doctors don't yet fully 
understand.

Stem cells would be taken from the bone marrow in my hip, and injected into my heart.

The
 treatment started in December 2010 and involved me first having a daily
 injection of a protein that stimulates the bone marrow for five days. 

I then had a local anaesthetic while doctors used a large syringe to take bone marrow from my hip.

This
 was then sent to the lab to have the stem cells removed. Later that 
day, I was given a local anaesthetic and sedated for the hour-long 
procedure, to transplant the stem cells. The consultant, Professor 
Anthony Mathur, fed a thin flexible tube up through the artery in my 
thigh to my heart, then fed the fluid containing the stem cells into it.

At first I felt no different. Since it was a trial, I knew some 
patients would have stem cells and the rest a placebo. But over the next
 few years I felt better and better.

Eventually, I was able to run for more than an hour on the treadmill, far more than I'd managed in police training.

I suspected I'd had the stem cells and last July Professor Mathur confirmed it - I was elated but not surprised.

Now,
 six years after my diagnosis, I do six miles of Nordic walking - 
trekking using poles - every other day, have climbed mountains, have 
more stamina than people half my age and my breathing is back to normal.

I'm still classed as having heart failure and still take my medication but feel completely better -it's life-changing.

It's relatively safe and the risk is similar to what people experience in an angioplasty and stent procedure

Professor
 Anthony Mathur is a consultant cardiologist at Barts Health  NHS Trust 
in London and professor of cardiology at Queen Mary University of 
London.

Heart disease is Britain's biggest killer, with 103,000 heart attacks in the UK annually.

But
 since we are getting better at treating heart attacks there are now 
more than a million people living with heart failure, when the heart can
 no longer pump sufficient blood around the body.

It causes 
breathlessness because the heart does not supply blood to other organs 
properly. This is especially noticeable in the lungs.

Doctors can try
 treating heart failure with medication to help heart function, or by 
fitting a pacemaker and defibrillator to help it beat properly.

But 
for the past ten years I have worked with the Heart Cells Foundation, 
which has helped fund the Regenerate trials. These have treated 
different groups of patients with their stem cells.

Some patients 
had had a recent heart attack, others had heart failure caused by heart 
disease or by a virus (which probably happened in Graham's case). The 
trials produced significant results.

Following the trials' success, 
we are now involved in the world's largest ever trial of stem cell 
therapy in heart attack patients. The BAMI study will treat 3,000 
patients across Europe to see if administering stem cells within a few 
days of a heart attack will prolong life by helping repair the heart and
 keeping it working properly.

We use stem cells taken from bone 
marrow - a good source, and a well-tested procedure. Heart failure 
patients begin with five days of injections of a growth factor, but in 
the BAMI trial we don't do this because we want to treat them soon after
 the heart attack.

We then take 50-100ml of bone marrow from their 
hip, which is processed to collect white blood cells, which contain the 
stem cells.

A catheter - a thin flexible tube - is inserted through 
the artery in the groin to the main artery to the heart; we also inject a
 dye so we can see the coronary arteries supplying the heart on an 
X-ray.Then we feed the catheter into the coronary arteries - before 
we inject the stem cells, we inflate a tiny balloon to block the artery 
so the cells will not flow back out.

Some cells will be flushed out, 
but we hope some will find their way to the damaged heart muscle and 
help to repair it, which takes six to 12 months.

Results from the 
Regenerate trials have already shown we can help patients with damaged 
hearts. We hope the newest trial will show we could help many more, so 
this could one day become a standard treatment after a heart attack.

It's
 relatively safe and the risk is similar to what people experience in an
 angioplasty and stent procedure - where we open blocked arteries using a
 tiny metal tube.

The procedure costs the NHS about £10,000 and is 
only available as part of the BAMI trial at the London Chest Hospital 
run by Barts Health NHS Trust.
