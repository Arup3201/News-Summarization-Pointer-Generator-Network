Youth is wasted on the young – so the saying goes – and doing their best to prove it are the over-50s.

They are more sexually active than six years ago, according to a survey which also found that a third of the age group enjoy sex more than in their youth.

Four in five of those in their early 50s make love  regularly, with a quarter enjoying a romantic episode under the sheets at least once a week.

Passion remains important even among 
those 20 years older, with almost half of the over-75s still having sex.

One in ten of this age group say they have sex once a week.

The findings chime with other 
research that has revealed today’s over-50s are more likely to be over 
the moon than over the hill.

Most report being happy about their 
health, relationships and finances – with contentment continuing to rise
well into their 70s.

Nearly 9,000 people aged 50 or more were questioned about their sex lives by Populus on behalf of Saga Magazine for the survey.

Almost three-quarters, or 71 per cent, reported having a healthy sex life, compared to 65 per cent in a similar study from 2007.

While many admitted having less sex 
than they used to, a quarter of men and a third of women said it was 
more enjoyable than in their 20s and 30s.

The fulfilment could be explained by 
the fact that two-thirds felt there was less pressure on them to 
perform.

The average over-50 reported having seven sexual partners 
during a lifetime.

Men typically had eight partners, while women had 
six.

A fifth of over 50s have sex at least once a week and on average have had just seven lovers in their lifetime

Baby boomers – aged between 60 and 64
– had the most sexual partners, with eight on average among men and 
women. One in eight claimed to have slept with 20 people in total.

And there was a surprising number of 
over-75s with colourful love lives, with one in 13 admitting to more 
than 20 partners over the years.

Saga Magazine said improvements in 
the general wellbeing of the over-50s might explain why more were 
enjoying active sex lives than six years ago.

Advances in medicine have 
transformed some areas of health care in recent years, while social 
attitudes about older people have changed, allowing them to lead more 
fulfilling lives.

Editor Kate Bravery added: ‘People having more, not 
less, sex has to be a good thing.

‘Perhaps it is the result of the 
better health, fitness, and general youthfulness that characterise 
today’s frisky over-50s? Or simply because people are still madly in 
love with their partners.’

The Women’s Institute – better known for jam-making tips – released a sex guide in 2008.

Topics included the best positions for women to try if their partners had previously had heart attacks.
