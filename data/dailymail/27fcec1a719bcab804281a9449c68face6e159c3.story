Speaking out: Moors murderer Ian Brady has described the decision to keep him detained in a maximum security hospital as 'politically motivated'

Moors Murderer Ian Brady has branded a mental health tribunal's decision to keep him detained at a maximum security hospital as 'politically motivated'. 

Last month, Brady lost his legal bid to be transferred to a prison and was told he will instead remain a patient at Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside for the foreseeable future on the grounds that he is mentally insane.

In reaction to the decision, Brady wrote a 700-word letter to Channel 5 News in which he criticised the decision of the mental health tribunal, the witnesses who gave evidence and the public money spent on it.

He said: '£250,000 wasted by Ashworth medical mediocrities manipulating a politically motivated tribunal... designed to distract public attention from the lack of reasoned argument and pertinent evidence.'

Brady - who has long-term paranoid schizophrenia - also criticised the health professionals who gave evidence at the tribunal.

'The pathetic petty abuse... rubberstamp witnesses employed to smear, discredit and distract, revealed more about Ashworth's collective culture of applied ignorance and malice than it did about me.

'Those listening in the real world would have doubted their senses.'

Speaking to Channel 5 News, Terry Kilbride, brother of John Kilbride who was 13 when he was strangled and buried by Brady and his accomplice Myra Hindley, said: 'He shows how twisted he is... in letters that he writes and the way he speaks like he spoke at the tribunal - not answering the questions.

'He wants to be there again - in the public eye, saying "It's all been a fix" so he can have an appeal and do it all again and waste another £250,000.'

In the two-page letter, Brady also reveals he is a keen viewer of the satellite news channel Al Jazeera and refuses to watch the BBC.

Rant: In the letter, Brady criticised the decision of the mental health tribunal, the witnesses who gave evidence and the public money spent on it

He said: 'The daily format of PC dumbed-down pulp has even infected the BBC, especially after the Blair/Campbell "sexed-up dossier", a criminal attempt to destroy and control. Al Jazeera and text are my news sources now.'

Victims' families have criticised giving Brady, 75, the opportunity to 'grandstand' at the mental health tribunal, while others described the hearing as a 'circus' and a 'complete waste of taxpayers' money'.

The tribunal was the first time Brady had been seen in public since the 1980s, when he was taken back to Saddleworth Moor in the search for the bodies of two of his victims, and the first time he had spoken in public since being jailed for life at Chester Assizes in 1966.

Brady and his partner, Myra Hindley, were responsible for the murders of five youngsters in the 1960s.

They lured children and teenagers to their deaths, with their victims sexually tortured before being buried on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester.

Pauline Reade, 16, disappeared on her way to a disco on July 12, 1963 and John Kilbride, 12, was snatched in November the same year. Keith Bennett was taken on June 16 1964 after he left home to visit his grandmother, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, was lured away from a funfair on Boxing Day 1964, and Edward Evans, 17, was killed in October 1965.

Brady was given life at Chester Assizes in 1966 for the murders of John, Lesley Ann and Edward.

Hindley was convicted of killing Lesley Ann and Edward and shielding Brady after John's murder, and jailed for life.

In 1987 the pair finally admitted killing Keith and Pauline.
