Battle: Imperial Highness Prince Sultan Ertugrul Osman V (who is now deceased) with his wife, Princess Zeyneb attend Ahmet Ertegun Memorial Service on March 2, 2007 in New York City

She is the widowed Afghan princess wife of the man known as the 'Last Ottoman Sultan' and is battling eviction from her $390 a month rent controlled Lexington Avenue, Manhattan apartment.

Her Imperial Highness Zeynep Osman, 69, has been asked to vacate the two-story apartment she calls home in the $10.1 million Upper East Side building she has lived in since her marriage to Ertogroul Osman in 1991.

Like her husband, who would have assumed the throne in Istanbul of the now-defunct Ottoman Empire as Sultan in 1994, Zeynep was expelled from her home in Afghanistan and is refusing to leave because she has 'become accustomed to a certain lifestyle'.

After the 
death of her husband in Istanbul, aged 97, in 2009, the three story 
building she has lived in for more than 20-years south of 74th 
Street was sold.

Her
 new landlord, Avi Dishi paid her a visit and according to Zeynep, the 
first words he said to her about the home her husband had lived in for 
64-years were: 'I want you out. I paid too much for this building to 
have you here.'

So
 began her three-year legal battle, a far cry from the 124-acre Yildiz 
Palace in Istanbul, Turkey, that she would have lived in with her husband
 had the Ottoman Empire not been overthrown by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 
1923.

Eviction: This is the three-story property on Lexington Avenue that was sold for $10.1 million in 2011 and is at the center of the rent-control fight between Princess Zeynep and Avi Dishi

Matters reached a head in January 2012, during a visit to a sick relative in Turkey, Dishi served her an eviction notice according to The New York Times.

He claims that upon purchasing the property, which has a restaurant on the ground floor, he was given only one lease which dated from 1977 that has expired to become a month-to-month occupancy.

Therefore, he claims he is well within his rights to ask the Afghan princess to leave the rent-controlled home.

However, Zeynep's lawyer, who she retains at the cost of thousands of dollars a month discovered a crucial detail on the eviction notice.

It was addressed to 'E. Osman and G. Osman', or more to the point, the would-be Sultan's first wife, Gulda, who passed away in 1985.

'You can’t evict a dead person,' Maddy Tarnofsky, Zeynep’s lawyer, said to The New York Times.

However, a court decided to deny Tarnofsky's motion to dismiss the eviction notice and the case is now in limbo, with Princess Zeynep having to provide death and marriage certificates to prove her occupancy of the apartment with her husband since 1991.

Speaking to The New York Times, Zeynep also complained about the state of disrepair that Dishi has let the apartment fall into.

Under the prior landlord the number of violations in the two-story home stood at 72 and now have topped out at 201.

New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development has had to spend $49,000 fixing up the apartment since 2005, replacing banisters, fixing radiators and boilers.

The city has billed Dishi for the repairs.

Grandfather: Abdul Hamid II (1842-1918), last Sultan of Turkey, c1880. Called the Great Assassin, he was a despotic ruler who was deposed and exiled in 1909

Dishi has purchased a neighboring property for $24.5 million and it is speculated he has plans to merge the two buildings.

However, he cannot while Princess Zeynep is in residency, although Dishi has claimed in court papers that she has indicated to him that she would be willing to leave for a 'significant' amount.

Indeed, speaking to The New York Times, Zeynep said that she was willing to cut a deal.

'It pains me to leave, but he must be reasonable,' she said.

'I am accustomed to a certain lifestyle, and he cannot just throw me out.'

Married to Ertugrul Osman for 18 years, Zeynep's husband was the descendant of Osman I, who established the Ottoman empire that controlled parts of Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

At its height in the 14th century it reached the gates of Vienna, Austria, but afterwards began a slow and steady decline.

Osman was studying in that city when his grandfather was deposed as Sultan and the Turkish Republic was proclaimed in 1923.

Known as His Imperial Highness Prince Ertugrul Osman, he moved into the Lexington Avenue apartment in 1947 and lived there till his death in 2009.

Educated and able to speak French, German, English and of course Turkish fluently, Osman worked for a shipping company for most of his life.

Oppulence lost: The dining room at the Yildiz Palace, Istanbul, circa 1890. The palace, was built in 1880 and used by Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II

He stayed out of Turkish politics and when interviewed in 2006 said that 'Democracy works well in Turkey.'

Born in 1912, Osman was the last surviving grandson of an Ottoman Sultan and his grandfather, Abdul Hamid II, ruled from 1876 to 1909.

He stayed away from Turkey for 52 years and on his return in August 1992, he went to see his grandfather's home at the 285-room Dolmabahce Palace.

Instead of a private tour, he insisted on joining a public tour group.

For more than 60-years Osman refused to travel on a Turkish passport, instead using a certificate that marked him as a citizen of the Ottoman Empire.

This was discarded in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and increased airport security.
