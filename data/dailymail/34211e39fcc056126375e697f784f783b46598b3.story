Police in New Zealand are appealing to young British men who stayed at a backpackers’ lodge and suspect ‘something happened to them there’ to come forward with their stories.

The appeal went out today to British and other male overseas travellers after a 56-year-old New Zealand man who ran the backpackers’ lodge appeared in court on dozens of indecent assault charges involving 16 young men who were said to have been drugged.

But police said they suspect that Michael Harris allegedly assaulted many other young men, mostly overseas tourists aged between 18 and 25, who stayed at the Main Street Lodge in the small town of Kaitaia on the northern tip of the North Island.

Harris, who appeared in the Kaitaia District Court today, was charged with almost 40 offences, including aggravated wounding related to allegedly drugging his victims to facilitate indecent assault and making intimate visual recordings.

He was also charged of possession of intimate visual recordings and indecent assault and was remanded in custody to appear at the court again on September 18.

The New Zealand Herald reported that police said many of the victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years.

The premises offers general backpacking facilities, hotel units and, on occasions, longer term accommodation in the owner’s residence.

The town of Kaitaia has a population of population 5,100.

Asking backpackers to come forward, police said they were continuing their investigations.

Detective Senior Sergeant Rhys Johnson said: ‘It is very important for us to speak to anybody who has stayed in the owner’s residence over the last two and a half years.

‘These victims are unlikely to know that something has happened to them, although they may have suspicions.

‘We will deal sensitively with them and offer all appropriate support required.

‘This is an ongoing investigation and we have a lot of work ahead to assess evidence and establish if there are further victims we are not yet aware of.’

To help potential victims contact the investigation team, police have set up an email address.
