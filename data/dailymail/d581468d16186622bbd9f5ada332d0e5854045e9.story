Reaching the peak of Mount Everest is the ambition of many an adventurous soul.

But these daredevils decided that - instead of climbing to the summit of the world's tallest mountain - they would skydive over it.

The skydivers were flown to the dizzying height of 18,000ft above sea level before leaping from the helicopter and hurtling towards the Himalayas at stomach-churning speed.

Only 30 skydivers per year complete the mind-blowing leap, soaring over the mountains before deploying their parachutes and floating back down amid spectacular scenery to the drop zone, located 12,350ft above sea level.

The thrill-seekers are equipped with specalised military and parachute equipment - including oxygen masks - to complete their high-altitude adventure.

Menuka Gurung, 35, from Everest Skydive, said: 'We do two groups every year with maximum of 12-15 members in each group. Each diver does maximum of three jumps.

'It takes approximately 30 minutes to complete the whole jump from taking off to landing,' he said.

'If we break the whole experience down, it will look somewhat like this: 15-25 minutes for flight, 40-60 seconds of free fall and 3-5 minutes for landing.

'The jump takes place over the Everest region of Nepal, specifically the Syangboche and Amadablam region.'

Ready to take the leap: A solo jump over the Everest summit costs a staggering £16,500

The price tag alone is enough to get pulses racing, with a solo jump costing £16,500 and tandems a heart-stopping £23,000.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary becoming the first human to reach the summit of Everest.

Mr Gurung added: 'Everest Skydive has come a long way since the first test operation held in 2008.

'The team's enormous level of dedication, and the people, has made Everest Skydive one of the most amazing adventures in the Himalaya today.

'It gives extreme adventure buffs the opportunity to get their names into the international record books and make history by taking a leap with the Everest Skydive team.'

The suits worn by the skydivers during the Everest Skydive are locally made by a young Thamel based Nepali entrepreneur, Rajen Dulal.

The red, blue and black skydiving suits, which are tailored in a small workshop, help support the local community and create jobs for the local residents.

In May 2008, Ben Ian Wood and Andy Montriou made history by being the first people to jump over Mount Everest..

Their first two attempts at 6.30am and 8am failed due to the weather which forced the pair to wait another agonising hour before taking off.

The pair eventually jumped from the stomach churning height of 16,000ft, landing safely at Syangboche airstrip and cementing their place in the record books.
