The Green Party is set to unveil its big weapon for the General Election campaign – a sultry, pouting, middle-aged ‘boyband’ comprising David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage.

The party, which is languishing at six per cent in the polls, is recruiting lookalikes to portray the four main party leaders in a cringe-inducing party political broadcast due to be screened next month.

Strangely, the Greens are even hiring an actress to play their own leader, the gaffe-prone Natalie Bennett, and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates.

Strategists stipulate that her doppelganger be in her late 30s to mid-40s – although Bennett is 49 –and be ‘like a schoolteacher, life experience under her belt. She must also be ‘the voice of reason, friendly, warm and approachable but has a message to get across’.

The full excruciating details of what the Greens believe is ‘a fun, clever and refreshing idea’ is revealed in a leaked casting brief.

It adds that four male party leaders’ lookalikes ‘should be unnaturally intense, emotional and passionate – like a boyband. Loads of smouldering stares, deep thinking and soulful singing. Thick lashings of powerful slow motion movements and pensive gazes will help intensify the drama.

‘They may be leaders of different parties, but they seem to know the same lyrics to the same song and be in perfect harmony. I like the idea that as the song builds and climaxes, they are literally finishing off each others sentences… That is how ridiculously in harmony they are.

‘Above all, they should all look incredibly pleased with themselves. It will be amusing to have disgruntled reaction shots of the other leaders at the end as the Green Party’s common sense message is delivered.’

On the lookalikes, it adds: ‘It would be great if the leaders were slightly better looking, more buff and hunkier than the actual leaders in real life. Kind of how they see themselves inside their own minds. But this is not a priority. First and foremost they need to register as politicians.’

Less kind critics might suggest that the Greens need to register as politicians themselves.

Some of the cringe-inducing lyrics of the Green Party’s song spoof 

It’s sweeter when we agree, a party political harmony (Oh baby)

Lose your voting inhibitions, join the one true coalition (ohh-ahh-lii-shuuuuun)

Let’s frack this green and pleasant land. Come on Eddie, join the band

The public won’t know what to do, if they have to pick from me and you-uuuu

The choice between us couldn’t be clearer. Oxford! Cambridge! Diversity for ya

Whether it’s Trident or High Speed 2, the lesser of four evils is up to you

MoS man: how I gatecrashed world's unfunniest send-up 

By Adam Lee-Potter

It is unusual enough to be in the same room as Messrs Cameron, Miliband, Clegg and Farage. But to be in a backstreet Soho studio with 13 versions of them gyrating, pouting and cavorting around was beyond bizarre.

Welcome to the casting session for what must go down as the most toe-curlingly awful party political broadcast ever.

I secretly infiltrated the Green Party audition under the flimsy guise of being an ersatz David Cameron. It was clear they were desperate. I emailed, just hours before the audition, telling them – truthfully – that Gok Wan once told me I looked like the PM.

Did I say they were desperate? I heard back within minutes – and the woman didn’t ask if I was a professional actor or had an agent. I’m not, clearly!

I was told that I would be auditioning for Cameron at 2pm the next day and that the fee – just for turning up – was £250. Super. But the email warned I should be prepared to ‘boyband it up’ – possibly the four most upsetting words I have ever received.

At the offices of Die-Cast, all 13 of us were told to learn our lines – which seemed a tad rich of the Green Party when its own leader couldn’t remember hers in a ‘car crash’ interview with London’s LBC radio station.

I hurriedly attempted to memorise the lyrics of Take That’s Greatest Day – the mawkish pop video for which we were set to recreate. Then five minutes later, it all changed: we were told to forget that and instead mug up on a ‘It’s sweeter when we all agree’ version.

This was rapidly becoming more confusing than a Green Party conference, not least because despite being middle-aged and suited, I don’t look at all like Cameron. But then the other three in ‘my’ boyband looked nothing like their supposed doppelgangers either.

‘Give me some smoulder,’ the director implored. ‘Be as seductive as you can. Give me more.’ I’m 44 years old, for pity’s sake. I did try to smoulder, which is hard enough at the best of times, but painfully embarrassing when you’re told to lip-sync to a tepid backing track.

I couldn’t help thinking this was part of the democratic system our forebears died for. That the law requires the nation’s broadcasters to actually screen this rubbish.

Chaos loomed when some portly chap – I have no idea whose lookalike he was supposed to be – admitted he didn’t have a suit with him.

The sweet woman in charge duly dispatched him to Marks & Spencer, telling him to take it back for a refund ‘after the gig’.

Then the internet went down. Oh, and they couldn’t work out how to play the track. Then it was the volume control. I rang my wife at this point. ‘Is this April Fool’s Day?’ came her reply.

Finally, after an anxious, 30-minute delay during which the pros gargled noisily and massaged their vocal cords, and I – um – didn’t, we were on. The brief rehearsal was over and this was the real audition.

I was in the first batch of hopefuls, which I took as a promising sign. We were escorted into a small, bright room. Behind the camera were an assortment of trendy types in lumberjack shirts and lots of facial hair.

We read out our names and posed for profile shots. We then had to mime along to the song. ‘Try to emote like a real boyband,’ said the director patiently. ‘Really go for it. Use your hands.’ I did try to channel my inner One Direction but I ended up looking like I was having a fit in the deep end of a swimming pool.

We carried on prancing about, nonetheless. Then, worryingly, the Clegg double cuddled me – I don’t quite know why – as we moved into the second verse.

Truly hideous: Reporter Adam described his efforts as 'David Brent at a teenage disco: excruciating and slightly off'

Shakespeare it ain’t, but the Greens clearly hope this song will ram home their point: when there’s little to divide the main party leaders, vote for us instead.

Next, we were told to ‘seduce’ the camera, one by one. I pouted, foolishly, and even tried a little growl.

One of the crew tittered, not unreasonably, as I awkwardly caressed my chest and even smoothed my eyebrow with a licked finger.

Yes, it was truly that hideous. Imagine David Brent at a teenage disco: excruciating and slightly off. Finally, we had to mime to camera as if we were making a political speech.

We all flapped the air and did that funny pointy thing with our thumbs that Cameron likes to do. The Miliband lookalike – the only one even remotely like his famous ‘double’ – got especially carried away, letting out an impressive glottal volley of gibberish.

Eventually, we were done, much to everybody’s relief. ‘You’ll be hearing from us if you’ve been successful,’ said an assistant.

We could say the same of the Green Party. They shouldn’t hold their breath.
