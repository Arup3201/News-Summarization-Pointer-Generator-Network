You can’t help but feel sorry for Victoria Pendleton. Imagine the come- down when you go from being the fastest thing on two wheels at the Olympics to being the most wooden thing on two legs on Strictly.

She must be one of the fittest women in the world so why she dances like she’s on the NHS waiting list for a hip replacement is a complete mystery.

After turning in a horribly stiff and awkward salsa on Saturday Victoria found herself, deservedly, bottom of the leader board with only 21 out of 40.

'Really something': Victoria put on an awkward and stiff salsa for her final dance

Victoria must be dehydrated after all the tears she has shed on the show

‘Well, that was really something,’ said Brucie after her performance. That ‘something’ being a complete car crash. Her hideous baby-pink satin dress and Aunt Sally make-up didn’t exactly help matters either.

When Craig Revel Horwood told Victoria that the stage props had more fluidity than she did and awarded her a 4 it led to another mini-meltdown. It was no surprise when she ended up in the dance-off alongside Michael Vaughan before being voted off last night. Perhaps it’s just as well that the judges sent her packing – Victoria has spent so much of the past two months sobbing she must be dangerously dehydrated by now.

But, even though she couldn’t dance, she was Strictly’s biggest signing this year and it’s a shame to see her go – not least because wondering how Len will get another cycling pun into his critique had become compulsive viewing.

At the other end of the scale is Denise Van Outen who, unless her partner James continues to drop her on her head as he has been doing in rehearsal, is dancing all the way to the final. For the second week running she topped the leader board, scoring 37 out of 40 for her elegant, flowing American Smooth. She even got a 10 from Bruno, which seemed a tad OTT considering Denise herself admitted that she went wrong – but then nonsensical marking was the order of the day on Saturday’s show.

Michael Vaughan just stood there and thought of England as Natalie Lowe gyrated around him

Of course, Denise’s participation continues to cause controversy due to the fact she was a fantastic dancer from week one rather than a ropey one who got better with every week. It could be worse though, she could be dazzlingly brilliant one week yet so awful you have to watch through your fingers the next – like Michael Vaughan.

While Michael is a natural at ballroom he just can’t find his dancing feet with the more passionate, upbeat numbers. On Saturday he did an Argentine Tango – a dance that’s meant to be full of jumps, kicks and flicks but during which he just stood rooted to the spot while his partner Natalie used him like a human pole as she posed and gyrated around him.

Meanwhile fellow Olympian Louis came in 
for a right old rollicking from the judges for his Paso Doble. I hate it
when they criticise Louis, his big, puppy-dog eyes fill with tears and 
you can see him swallowing hard so he doesn’t lose control of his 
emotions. Leave him alone!

In keeping with the judge’s skew-whiff scoring, Nicky Byrne was praised to the rafters and given 36 for a Charleston even though he was out of sync with his partner for most of the routine. After ending up in the bottom two at Wembley Nicky played the kiddie card and had his very photogenic children visit him at rehearsals. He also threw in a couple of their cute cousins for good measure. Well played Nicky.

With half the contestants now gone the battle is really on and if Michael’s three children don’t decide to ‘spontaneously’ drop in on their daddy in rehearsals next Saturday I’ll be very surprised.
