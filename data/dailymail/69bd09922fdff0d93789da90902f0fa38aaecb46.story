England take on Afghanistan on Friday morning looking to finish a dismal World Cup campgain on a rare positive note.

Defeats to New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka and, most embarrassingly, Bangladesh, have seen Peter Moores' side crash out of the competition at the first side.

But the England coach will hope his team can at least show some spirit against minnows Afghanistan, to avoid going home having only beaten Scotland all tournament.

Like England, their opponents have only picked up one win in the tournament and will be going home after this match, but for Afghanistan a win against Scotland was all they could have reasonably hoped to achieve.

Beating England would be a major scalp, and raise even more questions about captain Eoin Morgan's side.

Realistically, England should be hoping for a dominant win, which might help salvage some confidence even if it comes too late to enable progress in the tournament.

But with confidence levels as low as they can be, there is a chance of a defeat which would be even more shocking than Monday's failure against Bangladesh.
