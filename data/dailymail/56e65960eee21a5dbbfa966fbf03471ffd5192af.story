It's the ultimate box set for the ageing rocker.

For £2,000 a pop, former record producer Phil Wainman, 66, who once toured with The Who, is selling scale models of one of the band's classic gigs.

The Who in a Box is a painstaking re-creation of London's Marquee club stage in 1964, featuring Pete Townshend's guitar, his Marshall amplifiers and the double-bass-drum kit used by Moon.

Mr Wainman, who created chart-topping hits for the Bay City Rollers and the Boomtown Rats, was friends with The Who's drummer Keith Moon and shared his kit when he played with 
reggae star Jimmy Cliff.

He has hand-made 10 versions of the one metre wide and 36cm high The Who model, priced at £1,950 each. One sold for £7,000 to benefit the Teenage 
Cancer Trust.

Mr Wainman has also created a model of the Beatles' early stage set-up at the world famous The Cavern club in Liverpool and Queen's 1975 Christmas concert at the Hammersmith Odeon will follow.

Future artists in line for the model treatment could include Nirvana's iconic set for their MTV Unplugged show and the Sex Pistols' infamous 1976 gig at London's 100 Club.

Phil Wainman made a prototype Beatles box for his own interest and was amazed by the reaction he received from friends and family

'They are aimed at rockers my age with disposable income,' Mr Wainman told The Independent. 'People who have got the complete collection, the vinyl, the CD, the downloads.

'But they haven't been able to recreate the venue where these classic artists were discovered and played the shows which made them what they were.'

Mr Wainman reproduced The Who model from his own memories backed up by photographs.

'I once had a ‘drum-off' with Keith in Jim Marshall's London music store,' he recalled. 'It was very noisy and people gathered in the street to watch.'
