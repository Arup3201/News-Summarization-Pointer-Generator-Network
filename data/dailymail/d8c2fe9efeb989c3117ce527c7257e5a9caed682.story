Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died from a heart attack after taking ecstasy at a rave

A man accused of selling a lethal dose of ecstasy was cleared today after saying he could not have been the cycling dealer because he looked ‘stupid’ on a bike.

Ryan Kirk, 21, was acquitted of supplying MDMA to 16-year-old Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, who suffered three heart attacks after he overdosed on half a gram diluted in water in January this year.

The teenager died three days after an illegal rave in Croydon, south London, having assured his mother, ‘I love you, Mum. I promise I won’t die,’ before he left.

Mr Kirk had been accused of acting as a ‘mule’ for dealer Nicqueel Pitrora, meeting Daniel and four friends behind warehouses in Croydon, south London.

But while Pitrora pleaded guilty to supplying the killer substance, the case against Mr Kirk was based on a single teenager’s ‘weak’ identification of the supposed culprit, based on their twenty-second encounter.

The jury was shown footage of the identity parade and had asked to see the films for a second time just minutes before returning their not guilty verdicts.

The video shows an officer asking the teen witness - who cannot be named - if he has made a positive identification based on the mugshot of Mr Kirk.

The teen, supported by his mother, faintly replies, ‘Yes’, but had apparently failed to understand the question.

He then asks, ‘Do I have to be certain? If I have to be certain, then no.’

But he signed a form confirming Kirk was indeed the suspect.

Giving evidence, Mr Kirk said he could not have dropped off the drugs by bike since he had not ridden one since he was ‘16 or 17’.

‘I think I look stupid on a bike, I’m pretty lanky,’ he told jurors.

A mountain bike belonged to his best friend but was usually unchained outside Ryan Kirk’s house and could be used by anyone, jurors heard.

Four days later he was arrested at a party in his neighbour’s home.

‘I never dealt any drugs to anybody’, he maintained.

Today a jury of seven men and five women cleared Mr Kirk of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs on 17 January this year.

Prosecutor Tyrone Silcott had admitted
 the line-up identification was ‘weak’, although the boy later told the 
court in person he was ‘80 percent sure’ he had got it right.

The
 heard how Daniel and his friends had clubbed together £80 to spend on 
the party-drug to take at an illegal rave at a former cotton factory in 
Hayes.

Daniel fell unconscious after consuming MDMA at the event which was attended by 3,000 revellers.

The court heard Daniel took off his shirt after taking the drugs and was 'talking a lot more than he usually does', including talking about his girlfriend

He had sprinkled around half a gramme of the crystalline powder into 500ml of water and drunk it all at once after he was admitted inside the warehouse.

Shortly afterwards Daniel took his shirt off, became animated about his girlfriend and started to dance.

By 4am his temperature had soared and he collapsed unconscious on the floor.

He was rushed to Hillingdon hospital by paramedics but nothing could be done to save him.

The teenager who was a pupil at Archbishop Tenison’s School in south London, died at King’s College Hospital three days later after being admitted to the specialist liver unit for emergency surgery.

A toxicology report showed traces of MDMA in his blood.

The bright sixth-form student had dreamed of joining the army or becoming an English teacher before the lethal deal was struck with a dealer named ‘Shampz’ - whose real name is Nicqueel Pitrora.

Mr Kirk, Beckenham, Kent, was cleared of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs on 17 January.

He
 was further found not guilty of being concerned in the supply of Class A
 drugs between 1 January 3013 and 16 January 2014 and being concerned in
 the supply of Class B drugs over the same period.

Earlier
 this week Pitrora, of London Road, Croydon, admitted being concerned in
 the supply of a Class A drug, being concerned with the supply of 
cannabis and simple possession of cannabis.

Pitrora will be sentenced on 1 August.

Later Daniel’s parents, Tim and Fiona Spargo-Mabbs said in a statement: ‘Daniel was an incredible boy and an incredible son, who we loved with all our hearts, who made a very bad decision on 17 January.

‘Over the course of the next three days in January, we had to watch him slowly die as the drug had caused everything inside him to stop functioning.

‘We would willingly have given our lives in place of his if we could, and when Daniel died part of us also died.

‘As a family with a massive gaping hole now in our centre, we’re slowly trying to rebuild our lives into whatever our ‘new normal’ will be, but we’ve barely begun and have a very long and very hard road ahead of us.’

The family went on to appeal to those responsible not to ‘waste the rest of their lives continuing to sell drugs to schoolchildren, and playing their part in the damage, destruction and death of other people’s children’.

‘We believe very strongly that Dan is safe with God and that we will bring him once again and this does bring hope,’ the family added.

‘But the despair remains in having to walk through each day of the rest of our lives without him, because of this one bad decision.

‘The people who supplied the drugs have choices remaining to them, and the rest of their lives in which to make them, and we will continue to pray that they choose to use them for good.’
