Callers spent £56million on  premium-rate government phone lines last year – with half their time spent on hold.

Factoring in the value of time waiting to speak to a ‘real person’ would bring the actual cost closer to £150million, said spending watchdog the National Audit Office.

Its report found that despite attempts to limit them, ‘084’ numbers continue to be used ‘extensively’ across Whitehall.

Nearly half of the 120 phone lines served vulnerable or low-income groups such as pensioners, the bereaved, pregnant women and the unemployed, who faced ‘eye-watering’ costs.

The taxman, the National Pensions Centre, a redundancy helpline, the Bereavement Service and the CAFCASS information line aimed at children all use the lines.

However, the NAO said £26million was  spent by callers just waiting for an advisor to pick up the phone. In total people spent 880million minutes on premium calls and nearly half of that time was spent on hold.

Its report said: ‘In addition to the direct charges for calling government telephone lines, there is an opportunity cost to callers of the time spent waiting on calls.

‘Assuming that callers value their time at around 25p per minute, the value of time waiting on higher rate lines would be £100 million.’

It said that estimating the value of the time lost was a ‘useful measure’ that should make departments assess the quality of their phone services.

The NAO called for government departments dealing with vulnerable or low-income people to stop using 084 numbers.

Those connected to the costly lines spent nearly half their time - 46 per cent or 402million minutes - waiting to speak to an advisor

Callers spent 1.45 billion minutes connected to government phone lines, of which 880 million minutes were on higher rate lines.

Those connected to the costly lines spent nearly half their time – 46 per cent or 402 million minutes – waiting to speak to an advisor.

There were also glaring inconsistencies between departments, with some using the lines while others gave out toll free or lower cost numbers on local dialling codes.

The worst offenders were the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and HM Revenue and Customs.

The Department of Health is the only major department to rule out the use of 084 numbers.

Some 63 per cent of all telephone calls to government phone lines were made to the premium cost lines, which are also used by 8 per cent of GP surgeries in England and 4 per cent of local authorities.

Margaret Hodge, chairman, of the Public Accounts Committee, said the amounts being shelled out to use them were ‘eye watering’.

She added: ‘It is not acceptable that vulnerable people are facing some of the highest charges to call central government about important issues such as benefits and redundancy.’ She called for regulator Ofcom to ‘get to grips’ with the ‘confusing charging system’.

Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: ‘The most vulnerable callers, such as low-income households, face some of the highest charges.’

The average call cost to 0844 numbers is 5.6p from a landline and 17.1p a minute from a mobile.

For 0845 numbers, it costs 4.2p a minute from a landline and 17.6p from a mobile. But local code numbers are usually 3.4p from a landline and 1.1p a minute from a mobile, while 03 numbers are usually the same rate.

David Hickson, of the Fair Telecoms campaign, said the ‘penal cost’ of 084 numbers was ‘disenfranchising’ many from accessing government services

And Labour MP John Healey,  who has called for a ban on the ‘scandalous’ use of 084 numbers, said callers had no choice but to use them, however, they are charged ‘rip-off rates’.

HM Revenue and Customs has already switched to 03 numbers for its busiest lines and pledged to phase out higher rate numbers.

The Department for Work and Pensions had also promised free calls from mobiles to its 0800 benefit claims hotlines.

Changing all higher rate helplines to 03 numbers would save callers £29 million a year, while using only to 0800 numbers would save £46 million, says the NAO.
