Most humans have been caught gossiping about an unwanted guest in hushed tones.

But it seems that one of the world's smallest primates, the cotton-top tamarin, has a lot to say behind the backs of zookeepers.

Keepers at New York City's Central Park Zoo have recorded the chattering whispers of non-human primates for the first time ever.

They set out to record the primate's 
alarm calls used when they are scared of people, but instead discovered the 
monkeys seemingly fell silent when a distrusted zoo worker entered their
enclosure.

However, when the keepers analysed their recordings - or audio spectrograms - at a later date, they were shocked to discover that the animals were communicating very quietly in whispers, io9 reported.

Researchers Rachel Morrison and Diana Reiss who published their findings in the journal Zoo Biology, said the whispering could be evidence of convergent evolution in communication strategies used by social and cooperative species.

The small cotton-top tamarins might whisper to each other in the tropical forests of northwestern Columbia in South America where they live.

In another study, scientists suggest why apes do not have any musical talent, when humans, parrots, small birds, elephants and whales do.

Matz Larsson, senior physician at the Lung Clinic at Örebro University Hospital, believes the ability to mimic and imitate things 
like music and speech is the result of the fact that synchronised group 
movement makes it possible to perceive sounds from the 
surroundings better.

When they analysed their recordings at a later date, they were shocked to discover that the cotton-top tamarins (pictured) were communicating very quietly in whispers. The researchers said the whispering could be evidence of convergent evolution in communication strategies used by social and cooperative species

The study asserts that the evolution of vocal learning, including musical traits, is influenced by the need of a species to deal with the disturbing sounds that are created in connection with locomotion.

Dr Larsson said: 'When several people with 
legs of roughly the same length move together, we tend to unconsciously 
move in rhythm. When our footsteps occur simultaneously, a brief 
interval of silence occurs.

'In
the middle of each stride we can hear our surroundings better. It 
becomes easier to hear a pursuer, and perhaps easier to conduct a 
conversation as well.'

So it follows that apes in treetops and on the ground move unpredictably and irregularly and when humans made the transition to walking on two legs, the sounds of their
movements became significantly more predictable, making it possible for
them to listen to nature better and thereby increase their chances of 
survival.

In another study, scientists have found out why apes like the Orangutans pictured, do not have any musical talent, when humans, parrots, small birds, elephants and whales do

Dr Larsson explained that a behaviour that has survival value tends to produce dopamine, sometimes known as the 'reward molecule'.

In dangerous terrain, this could result in the stimulation of rhythmic movements and enhanced listening to surrounding sounds in nature.

If that kind of synchronised behaviour was rewarding in dangerous environments it may as well have been rewarding for the brain in relative safety, resulting in activities such as hand-clapping, foot-stamping and yelping around the campfire.

From there it was just a short step to dance and rhythm and the hormone dopamine flows when we listen to music.
