A U.S. nuclear submarine came within feet of running aground as it left Plymouth naval base, a report has found.

The drama unfolded as the USS Minneapolis-St Paul entered rough seas and tried to take evasive action resulting in five crewmen being swept overboard, two of whom died.

Chief Petty Officer Thomas Higgins and Petty Officer Michael Holtz were attached to the submarine with safety lines and had been helping the habour pilot to disembark when the submarine changed direction.

They died as they were repeatedly pounded 'like rag dolls' 
against the hull by the force of 20ft waves. The three other crew members were later rescued.

The 2007 Royal Navy report into the incident, released this week under the Freedom of Information Act, said that the 110m-long, 6,000 ton vessel, 'came within less than her own length' of hitting rocks and becoming stuck with 'catastrophic consequences' as she turned to get back into protected waters.

The report said that the incident, which came as the Devonport harbour pilot was trying to disembark the submarine, was largely the fault of the vessel's commanding officer Commander Edwin Ruff.

But it also criticised a lax safety culture at the naval base, the largest in Western Europe, including failing to heed warnings after a similar but non-fatal accident involving British submarine HMS Sovereign the previous February.

'This was a severe incident with multiple loss of life. There was a very real possibility of the boat grounding in very rough seas and on an ebb tide 500 yards south of Plymouth breakwater,' the report said.

'In addition the crew's mess hatch remained open in these conditions allowing a considerable volume of water into the submarine.

'Tragic as the loss of the lives of Holtz and Higgins was, the outcome could have been so much more catastrophic and thus must be regarded as at the less serious end of the potential spectrum of consequences.'

The report describes how the harbour pilot tried to leave the submarine too late as, at nine knots, it started to pass west of the Plymouth Sound breakwater and faced the open sea, which had a swell of up to four metres in height and wind speeds of up to 35 knots.

The report said the crew of a nearby vessel became alarmed at the submarine's speed as it approached the open water.

USS Minneapolisâ€“Saint Paul is a Los Angeles-class submarine and the first vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the metropolitan area of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota

She was launched on March 19 1981 after the contract for her to be built was awarded in 1973.

She was inactivated in June 2007 and finally decommissioned in August 2008 and transferred to Peal Harbour Naval Shipyard.

She was 360 feet long and weighed 6,000 tons and has one nuclear reactor on board.

The vessel took part in Operation Desert Shield in the Gulf War and was the first submarine to carry Tomahawk missiles designed for strikes against Iraq in the Gulf War

As the harbour pilot tried to leave through the mess hatch, the commanding officer swung the sub round into the waves, exposing the men on the desk 'casing', who were there to help the harbour pilot to the waiting boat, to the full force of the sea.

The two men who died were moored to the submarine with safety lines.

As the submarine turned to return to the safety of protected water, she came close to the rocks of the Panther Shoal, which would have been enough in the conditions, the report said, to ground her.

The mess was already around 18in deep in seawater which had come in through the open hatch.

The report said 'human failure lay at
the heart of this incident' and although saying responsibility for the 
incident lay with the submarine commander, it also recommended changes 
to the safety culture within Devonport to make it easier and quicker for
concerns to be reported and acted upon.

The harbour pilot was also later dismissed, a decision upheld by the Civil Service Appeal Board.

An MoD spokesman said: 'Naval Base Commander Devonport (NBCD) commissioned a review of the findings from the reports into the investigation to identify lessons learned. This was done in parallel with an ongoing safety culture review across the Naval Base.

'As a result, there have been improvements in the dissemination of lessons learned more widely, not only those resulting from the Minneapolis-St Paul accident.

'NBCD and (civilian contractor) Babcock have also instigated the safety initiative 'Time out for Safety' which is designed to encourage openness and improved safety culture across naval base and dockyard operations.'
