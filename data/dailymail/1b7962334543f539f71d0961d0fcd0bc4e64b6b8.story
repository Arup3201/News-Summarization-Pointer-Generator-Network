Tottenham will consider a move for Swansea striker Wilfried Bony once they exhaust the possibilities of signing Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea.

Lukaku has an offer from Atletico Madrid that is superior to any other deal on the table at this stage.

There is plenty of interest notably from Everton, Roma, Wolfsburg and Juventus while West Ham have already been turned down in a bid to take him on loan.

Price-tag: Swansea want £19million for Bony, having paid £12m in the first place

Passion: Bony is powerful, physical, has good technique and has shown an ability to score goals

Wanted: striker Lukaku (right) is wanted by Tottenham but Atletico Madrid have a superior deal on the table

Tottenham are not looking to offload Emmanuel Adebayor despite reports but there is interest in the former Arsenal and Manchester City striker.

They are more inclined to listen to offers for Roberto Soldado, although Mauricio Pochettino is open minded at this stage.

The Argentine does need another striker however, and Bony represents an alternative to Lukaku.

He is powerful, physical, has good technique and has shown an ability to score goals in the Premier League.

Swansea know there is interest from a lot of the top clubs and insist he will only be sold to one of the top six in the country.

They have placed a price tag of around £19million on the Ivory Coast international and will hold out for that after paying £12m in the first place.

Swansea have an offer on the table for Luc Castaignos of FC Twente but face competition from Benfica.

Lookout: Mauricio Pochettino needs a striker at Tottenham and may turn to Bony to fill the void
