He might not be speaking the same language as most of his players but David Moyes has had no trouble getting his message through to them in his first full week of training. They all go into Friday night's game against Elche knowing that intensity is the watchword and with the sound of him shouting 'go go go!' at them on the training pitches of Zubieta.

'The coach has told us he wants us moving the ball quicker' says defender Gorka Elustondo who also admits that Moyes wants his team to lose their lightweight pushover tag and become more difficult to play against. 

They played decent enough football under sacked Jagoba Arasate but the tempo was slow and when they lost the ball they lacked the aggression to win it back quickly.

'We are not the biggest team and we know we have to compensate for that by getting close to the opposition, by upsetting them, and by being a nuisance', he said.

The Moyes message appears to be sinking in with the players responding well to the new man despite the demands and the double training sessions that have come with them. Last week was a welcomed first point for the new boss and now they want a winning start at Anoeta against Elche.

Once again Moyes will be without central defender Iñigo Martinez who pulled out of the opening fixture against Deportivo just before kick-off. He has the quality to be one of the pillars of Moyes' team and he has also taken on-board the message despite it being delivered in his new coach's broad Scottish accent.

Despite the language barrier, Moyes is already beginning to get his message accross

'There is no problem with understanding him,' he says. 'The translator is there for that and you get plenty of your message across with gestures too. We know he wants 100 per cent from us in every game in every tackle.'

Moyes will hope that if Barcelona are allowed to sign a player to cover Thomas Vermaelen's likely five-month absence (they are currently investigating the possibility) they do not look to Martinez who has been a target in the past. He will want the Spain U-21 international when he returns to fitness.

'When we played against Manchester United last season we noticed that they were physically much stronger than us' Martinez adds on the subject of Moyes' efforts to toughen up the group he has inherited.

Sociedad looked harder to beat than previously this season in their first game under Moyes

The former United and Everton manager will pick an unchanged defence from the one that kept a clean sheet in Riazor and will once again have Markel Bergara in front of the back-four shielding the defence. He is another who looks like becoming one of the cornerstones of this team.

'The training sessions are short but very intense,' says the midfielder. 'He wants us on top of the opposition and he wants us making challenges.'

So far supporters are happy with the direction Moyes has taken. 'La Real' had become too easy to beat this season and fans saw against Deportivo that that will no longer be the case. Tonight the visitors are Elche who have yet to lose this month but are still in the bottom three.

Moyes is likely to bring experienced playmaker Xabi Prieto into the team at the expense of Sergio Canales but will ask for the same again from his players: intensity, and the first victory of a new era.
