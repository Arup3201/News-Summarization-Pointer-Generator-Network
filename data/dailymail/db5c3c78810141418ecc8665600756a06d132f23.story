Target has been forced to remove a product listing for a plus-size dress from its website after shoppers complained that it was being worn by a pregnant model.

The retailer came under fire when an online customer spotted a maternity model donning the Merona Women's Plus-Size Short-Sleeve V-Neck Maxi Dress in Black on the website and flagged it up.

Target has since removed the page from the website, but not before dozens took to Twitter to complain that the retailer didn't use a plus-size model in the ad, calling the error 'disturbing' and 'fatphobic'.

Mislabeled: Target has been forced to remove an ad for a plus-size dress from its website after customers complained that it was being worn in a product shot by a pregnant model - not a plus-size one

Error: In the product picture, a blonde woman smiles as she models the black and white striped maxi dress, placing one protective hand on her very pregnant belly

In the product picture, a blonde woman smiles as she models the black and white striped maxi dress, placing one protective hand on her very pregnant belly.

A belt tied round her hips makes her bump even more visibly prominent.

One annoyed customer commented on Jezebel.com: 'Really, Target? Pregnant does not equal plus-size and vice versa. It's kind of insulting.'

Another noted that the mix-up is confusing for shoppers, since it means they don't get a clear idea of what the garment would look like on their bodies.

'I'm pretty sure no plus-size women 
want to see that you're too cheap and careless to actually put your 
clothes on plus-size women, so that they can gauge how they look on a 
body type similar to their own!' she wrote.

Critics also took to Twitter to voice their concern about the mistake.

One wrote: 'As if the term plus-size wasn't disturbing enough, now Target thinks it means "pregnant"', while another called the mistake 'fatphobic'.

A Target representative told MailOnline that the unfortunate mislabeling was due to human error, and that the company took down the page immediately after the mistake was flagged up to them.

'First and foremost we absolutely apologize and regret any discomfort or offense this error might have caused,' he said.

'We appreciate the error being called to our attention and will work hard to ensure something like this doesn't happen again.'

Offensive mistake: In April, Target sparked an outrage after a plus-size dress (pictured) was listed as 'Manatee Gray' on their website, while the standard size version of the same item was called 'Dark Heather Gray'

Admitting their error: Target ultimately apologized, explaining that the mix-up was due to a lack of communication between the two different teams of buyers handling the dresses

It's not the first time the retailer has sparked controversy for mislabeling plus-size garments on its website.

In April, customers were outraged after Target labeled one of its plus-size dresses as 'Manatee Gray', while the standard size of the same item was called simply 'Dark Heather Gray'.

A shopper was browsing the website when 
she spotted the unfortunate discrepancy and brought it to the attention 
of the retailer via Twitter.

'Really, Target? Pregnant does not equal plus-size and vice versa. It's kind of insulting'

Target ultimately fixed the error, explaining that the mix-up was due to a lack of communication between the two different teams of buyers handling the dresses.

Target spokesman Joshua Thomas told Forbes.com at the time that Manatee Gray is a common color name for many of their products.

Unfortunately, the two different teams responsible for the standard and plus-size Mossimo Kimono maxi dress did not coordinate color names when they entered the product information for the site.
