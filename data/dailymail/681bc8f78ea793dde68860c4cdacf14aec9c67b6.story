The transgender star of a YouTube reality show has been found brutally murdered in her own California home.

31-year-old Dominique Newburn’s body was found Tuesday afternoon in her blood spattered Fontana home after police responded to a domestic disturbance call.

Neighbors saw the suspect flee the scene in the Hollywood Houseboys star’s own car. Though his hands were full of clothes, the African American man was reportedly shirtless as he drove away in Newburn’s black Mercedes-Benz.

Slain: The transgender star of a YouTube reality show was found brutally murdered in her Fontana, California home Tuesday

Grisly: A San Bernardino police officer photographs blood at Newburn's front door. Her home was reportedly covered in blood and Newburn's body was found near a window she was trying to escape from

Bludgeoned? Police at the scene in Fontana, California. Coroners said Newburn sustained substantial trauma but are awaiting autopsy results for an exact cause of death

‘Hungry for FAME. Hustling for money. Hopeful to MAKE-IT,’ was the tagline for Hollywood Houseboys, a docu-reality series on Youtube about a group of gay black men, as well as their transgender friend Newburn.

Though popular for a time, the short-lived 2010 series did not make it. Now, neither has one of its stars.

Newburn’s body was found near a window, reports KCAL, which police say suggests she was making a desperate attempt to escape her attacker.

Get away: Neighbors told police a shirtless African American man in his 30s or 40s drove from the scene in Newburn's Mercedes C240, which was later found abandoned

Internet fame: Newburn was a performer looking for success in the entertainment industry. She starred in a short-lived Youtube reality series called Hollywood Houseboys

On stage: Born Daymond Watford, Newburn was a singer and performed as Domonique Duffy

Blood was found across the porch of Newburn’s home and one the front door, which was left wide open.

The San Bernardino County coroner’s office said only that Newburn had ‘sustained trauma.’ She was pronounced dead at 4:38pm.

Autopsy results with an exact cause of death are pending.

Police were initially in search of 
Newburn’s black 2004 Mercedes C240, which witnesses told police was 
driven away by a ‘bare-chested’ African American man between 30 and 40 
years old.

The car was found abandoned Wednesday at a San Bernardino park and police continue the search for the suspect.

Born Daymond Watford, Newburn appeared under her stage name Domonique 
Duffy in the premiere episode of Hollywood Houseboys.

On
 the show’s website Newburn wrote that her ‘current Hollywood ambitions 
are to have gender reassignment surgery…and be the first trans-gender to
 one day have a hit song on iTunes!’

Partnered? Newburn's partner at the time appeared in the 2010 premier of Hollywood Houseboys, though it's unclear if they were together at the time of her murder

Performing: Newburn's Hollywood ambition, according to the show's website, was to become the first transgender person with a number one iTunes hit song

Murdered: Hollywood Houseboys' tagline was 'Hungry for FAME. Hustling for money. Hopeful to MAKE-IT.' But the show never did make it and now neither has its 31-year-old transgender star
