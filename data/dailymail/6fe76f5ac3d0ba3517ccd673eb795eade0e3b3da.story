Together: Francois Hollande (left) and Valerie Trierweiler (right) last year, before their split

Valerie Trierweiler has threatened to publish her former partner François Hollande’s private text messages to her to prove he had made fun of the poor, it was revealed today.

The jilted 49-year-old author has accused the French President of disliking the poor in a tell-all book called Merci Pour Ce Moment (Thank You For This Moment), which its publisher said is one of the decade's top best-sellers.

And, according to The Sunday Times, Miss Trierweiler has told friends of her willingness to make public his texts, to prove in court his mockery of ‘les sans dents’ (‘the toothless ones’) - a phrase he allegedly used to label the poor.

In her book, she said of him: ‘He presented himself as a man who disliked the rich. In reality, the president doesn't like the poor. In private, this man - the left-winger - calls them “the toothless” and is so pleased at how funny he is.’

The Socialist ended his seven-year relationship with Miss Trierweiler after his affair with actress Julie Gayet, 42, came to light in January.

Earlier this month at the Nato summit in Newport, south Wales, Mr Hollande insisted he was entirely devoted to helping the poor.

He said: ‘I won't allow to be brought into question something I have stood for all my life... and notably the human relationship I have with the weakest, the most modest, the humblest, the poorest, because I am here to serve them and they are my reason for existence.’

Mr Hollande, 60, has also denied her claims that he called the poor 'les sans-dents'.

But Miss Trierweiler’s book, which shot to the top of the Amazon.fr French bestseller list and was quickly out of stock in many bookstores, has been further undermining the President's image.

This has already been damaged by broken promises to turn around joblessness and the stagnating economy.

And last Thursday, a poll showed nearly two thirds of French voters would like to see their deeply unpopular Mr Hollande resign before the end of his term in 2017.

The IFOP/Le Figaro magazine survey showed that 62 per cent of respondents wanted him to quit, three years before the next scheduled presidential election.

A quarter of Socialist voters said they wanted to see the resignation of Mr Hollande, who is the most unpopular French president since the Second World War.

And earlier this month, a junior trade minister resigned just nine days after his appointment in a cabinet reshuffle after it emerged he had not paid income taxes for three years.
