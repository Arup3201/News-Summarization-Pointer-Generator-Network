Two of the victims of Texas high school teacher Brandon Ashley McDaniel have taken to the stand in the sexual assault case against the 38-year-old, sharing similar stories of the way McDaniel groomed them both into having sexual relations with him.

McDaniel, a married man, is facing an 80-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to having sexual relations with five female students - one as as young as 14 - at Sam Houston High School in Arlington.

A court has heard how McDaniel, who 
resigned as chairman of the school's English department following his 
arrest in February, used text messages to start up relationships with 
the girls beginning in 2001.

Brandon Ashley McDaniel, 38, had been accused of having sexual relationships with five students at Sam Houston High School in Arlington and could receive a maximum of 20 years in prison on each count

He has pleaded guilty to four charges and could receive a maximum penalty of 20 years for each count.

One
 of the victims, who is now 20 and attends Texas A&M University, 
testified that she was 17 when McDaniel sent her texts that gradually 
grew more sexual over time.

He asked is she were a virgin and one message asked if she touched herself, the Star Telegram reported.

'One day in October, he kissed me,' she said. 'A full-blown, on the mouth kiss.'

McDaniel also allegedly asked her if he was a bad person for wanting to kiss her.

The court heard how, two days after the kissing incident, they started meeting after school in his maroon Dodge Durango.

The girl would take his keys and go to the car, ducking down in the passenger seat and waiting for him to come. They would have oral sex in the car, she testified.

McDaniel allegedly told her he had never cheated on his wife before.

The next woman to testify Monday — now a 20-year-old University of Texas student — told the jury that McDaniel had said the same thing to her about never cheating on his wife.

The woman called McDaniel 'a laid-back teacher' who did not dress professionally.

The two exchanged cellphone numbers after McDaniel asked her to do the lighting for a school dance project.

She claimed she soon got a message from him saying: 'Tell me your darkest fantasy.'

One day while they were in the computer lab, McDaniel started kissing her.

They played truth-or-dare in text messages and had oral sex in a classroom, she said.

'He said he had never cheated on his wife,' the woman said.

Court affidavits filed upon McDaniel's arrest stated all sexual acts were consensual.

One of the arrest affidavits, according to Star Telegram, alleged McDaniel's started a relationship with a 14-year-old.

When she turned 15 she once spent the night at McDaniel's house when his wife was away, and he was also with the teen in her bed.

When her mother suddenly came home, McDaniel's jumped out the window, the affidavit said.

The case against Brandon Ashley McDaniel is being heard here, at Tarrant County Courthouse in Fort Worth, Texas

Both women who testified Monday said they initially did not want to take the stand.

Both said their parents were not aware that they were testifying.

One woman who testified had told police about having sex with McDaniel but then completely recanted and signed a statement for his defense attorneys saying she did not wish to prosecute.

'I thought all parties involved had equal responsibility and it was unfair for just him to be at fault,' she said.

Alana Minton, a Tarrant County prosecutor working on the case, asked the woman if she wanted to be on the witness stand Monday.

'I had put this all behind me,' she said. 'This is just bringing it all back up.'

McDaniel has asked the jury to recommend his punishment.

He will be sentenced at a later date.

The status of McDaniel's marriage remains unclear.
