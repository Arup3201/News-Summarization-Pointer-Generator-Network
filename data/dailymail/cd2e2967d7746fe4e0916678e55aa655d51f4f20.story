'Deep hatred': Ian Forman made a list of mosques near his home which he referred to as his 'target'

Eyes  glued to his computer screen and wearing his treasured SS cap, this is the Hitler-obsessed fanatic who planned to blow up a string of mosques.

Ian Forman sat in his bedroom writing racist rants on the internet and making explosives which he hid under his bed.

The 42-year-old boasted to friends that the devices were packed with ball bearings and nails, and made a YouTube video about ‘lighting up the sky’ with burning mosques.

He was so obsessed with the Nazis that friends called him Adolf and he kept an SS uniform in the three-bedroom house he shared with his retired parents.

As this image from home-made webcam footage shows, he would often wear parts of the uniform in his bedroom while he plotted the murder of Muslims living nearby.

The video was released yesterday by police after Forman was jailed for ten years for terror offences.

Kingston Crown Court heard he appeared a respectable man, with a university degree, a wife and a job. But underneath, he had a ‘deep hatred’ of Muslims and made a list of mosques to target near his home in Birkenhead, Merseyside.

Yesterday, even his own barrister described him as ‘rather pathetic’.

Sentencing, Judge Paul Dodgson called him ‘an unlikely figure’ to be convicted on terror charges.

He said Forman was living in a fantasy world. ‘One of the abiding images ... is the video you took with a webcam, of yourself with your SS hat on in your bedroom, typing what I strongly suspect were racist rants on messaging services,’ he added.

Wearing glasses and dressed in a blue shirt and grey tie, Forman waved to his wife Moira as he was led from the dock.

During his trial, he was described as evil after the court heard he referred to his list of mosques as his ‘dreck ziel’ – a German phrase meaning ‘dirt target’.

He researched how to make bombs online before police found chemicals and a homemade explosive device in his room last June.

Forman
 spoke of his admiration of Adolf Hitler on social media. He planned to 
buy a mannequin so he could better display his Nazi uniform.

Police
 were alerted when colleagues at a glass recycling firm where he was a 
receptionist found he had been researching how to obtain dangerous 
chemicals on the internet at work.

During the investigation, he wrote a letter to police warning them not to side with ‘the Muslim filth’.

David Mason QC said in mitigation: ‘He perhaps came across as someone rather pathetic, very bright, holding appalling views but not your average terrorist.’

Forman, who graduated in German and Spanish at Liverpool John Moores University, is understood to have been operating alone.

He was convicted of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts following an 11-day trial in March.

He was told yesterday he would serve half of his jail sentence before being let out on licence.

His wife, who lived apart from him at the time of his plotting, has vowed to stand by him while he is in prison.

Tough: Forman had been held in Belmarsh prison (pictured) in Thamesmead, south-east London, which has a 'significantly high ethnic population' which he found 'extremely difficult', the court heard
