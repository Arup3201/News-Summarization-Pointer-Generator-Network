This incredible series of images captured in the reflection of a bubble is enough to blow your mind.

Inspired by the film Blade Runner where a whole landscape is reflected in a human eye, patient photographer Richard Heeks has spent years mastering his art in Exeter, Devon.

Mr Heeks, 39, has captured the exact moment a bubble bursts as well as snapping bubbles within other bubbles.

Unusual: A beautiful countryside scene was captured in the prefect circle of the bubbles

Stunning: The series of images were inspired by Blade Runner where a landscape was reflected in an android's eye to give a new perspective of the world

World: Photographer Richard Heeks, seen here centre, captured the world in a bubble as he experimented with photography

But his latest work is spectacularly original and all shot close to home.

He said: 'Most of my bubble photos were taken in my garden in Exeter where I was living a couple of years ago.'My house was in the rural grounds of a beautiful old red brick lunatic asylum that had been converted into housing.'

Eerie: Branches captured in this shot resemble the iris of an eye, like the Blade Runner shot from the ground-breaking movie which inspired the photographer

Colours: The bubble gave a new way of looking at the world, showing a strange beauty and impressive view of the landscape

'There were lots of beautiful things to reflect, such as the red brick buildings and large old trees.'After buying a cheap digital camera in 2005, Mr Heek's obsession with photography grew and he now takes pictures wherever and whenever he can upgrading his camera every two years.

And when he isn't doing that he enjoys blogging about photography.

He has made a name for himself by setting up spectacular images of  bubbles.

The keen photographer uses a  £500 Nikon D7000 digital camera and uses no other equipment buts light and dark areas to create strong reflections - using sun light or bright lights from buildings.

He said: 'I tend to use the sun or bright buildings for light.  I use dark and shadowed or secluded areas for a dark background. Hedges block light to create shade, as do trees, walls and buildings. I love relying on nature. I think the best shots tend to be natural.'

Reflection: Painstaking photographer Richard Heeks was captured in a landscape reflected by a bubble as the viewer catches a glimpse of the cameraman at work

Control: Patient photographer Richard Heeks can be seen holding the bubble as he took the shot and directed the image

He added: 'I have to surround myself with patient types as it can be a one in a thousand shot to get it just right.'I don't' use any technology to capture my spectacular images. 'I'd love to photograph people one day in the future - to be a portrait photographer.'

Perspective: Photographer Richard Heeks captured the transitory image of the world reflected before the bubble burst

Vase: This bubble shaped like a vase reflected vibrant colours and showed the skill of the cameraman who had to act quickly to take the shot

Perfect circle: The shades of a beautiful night time view had a fresh glow when it was caught reflected on the bubble

Influential: Richard Heeks was inspired by the imagery of  Ridley Scott's cult 1982 movie Blade Runner, with the landscape reflected in the eye of an android
