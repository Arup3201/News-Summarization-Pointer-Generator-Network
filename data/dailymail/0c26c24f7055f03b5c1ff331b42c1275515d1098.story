Failed attempt: FBI agents confirmed that today that they believe former veteran Mario Edward Garnett, 40, was responsible for a series of bank robberies 1,800 miles apart over Christmas and the death of Officer Kevin Gale Stauffer

It has been revealed the man shot dead by police after a suspected 1,800 mile terror-spree of armed robberies which culminated in the fatal shooting of a police officer in Tupelo, Mississippi, was arrested in 2010 for threatening President Obama's life.

Federal law officers and the Secret Service have confirmed that Mario Edward Garnett, 40, was indicted in August 2010 after allegedly posting a message on the White House website that promised to 'blow out the brains' of the president on national television if her was to ever 'order a strike on Iran.'

Garnett also allegedly threatened the life of Benhamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and in another message linked to him, posted, 'I'm going to settle some scores on behalf of Israel and America's victims on behalf of those they continue to oppress. I'll kill president and farmer alike.'

According to ABC News, the two messages were sent six days apart and have come to light since Garnett's death in a shootout with police outside a Tupelo, Mississippi bank on Saturday in which Officers Kevin Gale Stauffer was killed and Joseph Maher injured.

Stauffer, an Iraq War veteran and father of two, was killed. Maher was wounded and is expected to survive.Â 

Garnett, 40, was from the Midwest, 
had served for four years in the U.S. Army and appeared to have no 
friends or relatives in Arizona, Police spokesman James Holmes said at a
 Sunday afternoon news conference.

Holmes said that it was unclear when Garnett arrived in the state.

Twice in one day: Police believe that Mario Edward Garnett is pictured here and is suspected of robbing a Bancorp South bank in Tupelo, Mississippi and another in Atlanta, Georgia

Reign of terror: The robber pulled off two heists in one day before traveling 1,800 miles to Phoenix, where he was killed

The alleged robber, Garnett, was shot dead by a Phoenix police detective during a gun battle with cops on Saturday after they intercepted him when he robbed a bank there - his third heist in just a week.

The violence ended a week of mayhem that began Monday morning in Atlanta, Georgia, and sparked a nationwide manhunt.

A total reward of more than $200,000 had been offered to anyone with information leading to the arrest of the suspect.

FBI agents are confident that the man who died in Phoenix was also responsible for the robberies in Atlanta and Tupelo because his cell phone records show he was in those places at the times of the crimes.

Agent Daniel McMullen, also told reporters in in Tupelo that there were 'numerous similarities' between the three bank robberies, including the clothing worn by the suspect, statements he made during the incidents and his 'overall modus operandi.'

McMullen said the FBI believes the suspect killed by Phoenix police was the same person from the Atlanta and Tupelo robberies.

Also on Sunday, the Secret Service said Garnett was arrested in 2010 after making online threats against the president.

Secret Service spokesman Max Millien said Garnett was living in Oklahoma City at the time of the arrest. Millien would not say how the case was resolved.

Surveillance photos from the attempted bank robbery in Atlanta showed a man wearing a black-and-white patterned jacket tried to rob a Bank of America branch around 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 23.

He was wearing a black ski mask and black gloves and carrying a handgun.

After failing to get any money from a teller, the man demanded and received an undisclosed amount of money from someone who was using an ATM in the bank's lobby. The man was seen leaving in a light gray car with no license plate.

Later that same day, the suspect stole an undisclosed amount of money from the BancorpSouth in Tupelo before fleeing in a gray sedan, the FBI has said.

Officers Gale Stauffer and Joseph Maher were responding to a bank alarm and a report that the suspect had fled in a white SUV when they spotted such a vehicle stalled in traffic.

The officers were confronting the SUV's driver when the suspect exited the gray sedan, which was stopped behind the SUV, and ambushed the officers, according to McMullen.

Stauffer died and was buried Friday after a funeral attended by as many as 1,000 people. Dozens of uniformed officers from Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and elsewhere attended the service.

Stauffer's wife, Beth, said her family was grateful for investigators' work and for the support they've received.

'We can truly begin the healing process, and that could not have happened without the hard work of so very many,' she told reporters Sunday. 'Gale would be so proud.'

Tupelo police Chief Bart Aguirre told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal that Maher's condition has improved and he was able to walk some with assistance Friday.

Shaken: Members of the community also held a silence for Officer Joseph Maher, 27, who was also shot by the suspects and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition

Maher moved out of the intensive care unit at North Mississippi Medical Center and into a private room.

The Phoenix shooting happened Saturday morning at a Compass Bank branch in the near-northwest part of the city after someone called 911 to report seeing a man run into the bank while wearing a mask.

There were five people inside the bank during the robbery, Holmes said. A customer who ran outside when Garnett turned his attention to the bank manager also called 911.

The first officer to arrive saw the man leave the bank with a bag and a handgun.

'The officer drew his service weapon and began giving the suspect commands at which time the suspect raised his weapon and began firing at the officer,' Holmes said in an earlier statement.

A detective who had just arrived at the scene shot the suspect, who was pronounced dead after being taken to a Phoenix hospital. No officers or bank employees were injured.

Holmes said Garnett drove a rental car to the Phoenix bank. It was unclear where Garnett had been and what he had been doing while in the state.

'We have no idea what he did between the 23rd of December and the 28th of December,' he said.
