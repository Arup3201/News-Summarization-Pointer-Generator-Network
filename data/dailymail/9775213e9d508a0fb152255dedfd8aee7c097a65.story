The school where paedophile teacher Jeremy Forrest seduced his 15-year-old victim has banned girls from wearing ‘figure hugging’ clothes or short skirts.

Bishop Bell Church of England School in Eastbourne, East Sussex, wants pupils to have the ‘highest standard’ of appearance, and banned make-up for girls below school year 10 - ages 14 to 15.

Girls are banned from wearing underwear which is visible or skirts which are more than 2in above the knee - and pupils are not allowed to wear ‘figure hugging, tight, skinny-fitting styles’.

Rules: The uniform guide which has been produced by Bishop Bell Church of England School in Eastbourne, East Sussex, where paedophile teacher Jeremy Forrest seduced his 15-year-old victim

There is no suggestion the rules were imposed as a result of Forrest's conviction for abduction and sexual activity with a child, which later saw the 31 year old jailed for five and a half years in June.

A newsletter to all parents said the new guidelines will encourage pupils to ‘take pride in their appearance and their school’.

It stated: ‘We strive for the highest standards in all aspects of school life and believe that pupils should take pride in their appearance and their school.

‘High standards of appearance are an important part of each pupil's sense of values and are a preparation for the world outside school.

Guidelines: An example of the figure hugging clothes which have been banned. Girls are also banned from wearing underwear which is visible or skirts which are more than 2in above the knee

‘Therefore, the school has a clearly 
stated policy that all pupils are expected to wear full school uniform 
both whilst journeying to or from school and, of course, on site.

'Figure hugging, tight, skinny-fitting styles, those with decorative buttons or chino look trousers are not acceptable'

‘The
highest standards are maintained from the moment pupils enter the 
school and parents are expected to support the policy with regard to 
uniform.’

The letter includes a pencil portrait of a child with various parts 'tagged' with uniform guidance.

It states that girls are not allowed to wear ‘coloured or patterned undergarments’ under their blouses which are visible.

Nail varnish, body piercings and most items of jewellery were also deemed ‘not acceptable’.

The guidelines state: ‘Figure hugging, 
tight, skinny-fitting styles, those with decorative buttons or chino 
look trousers are not acceptable.

Teacher: Jeremy Forrest was jailed in June for child abduction and sexual activity with a child

‘Trousers are required to be straight cut and are loose around the ankles without Lycra or similar stretch material.’

The school also issued strict rules on skirts, which should be: ‘No more than 5cm (2in) above the middle of the knee.

‘Skirts may be pleated or straight in style but should not have any Lycra or similar stretch material.’

All of the pupils at the school must wear a tie, blazer and white shirt or blouse. Boys are required to don plain black trousers while girls can choose between a smart trousers or a skirt.

The school's management was unable to comment on the guidelines yesterday as they had broken up for the summer holidays.

And an East Sussex County Council spokesman said they could not comment on individual uniform policies for schools.

Forrest was jailed for child abduction and five counts of sexual activity with a child. His trial at Lewes Crown Court heard how he groomed the girl at school and first kissed her in a classroom.

Fearing their affair would be exposed, the pair sparked a huge manhunt when then fled to France last September. But Forrest was eventually arrested in Bordeaux and extradited back to Britain.
