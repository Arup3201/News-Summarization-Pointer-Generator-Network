Friends of the accused Boston
Marathon bomber convicted of obstructing the investigation into
the deadly blasts may be exonerated due to a Supreme Court
decision in an unrelated case.

A U.S. jury in July found Kazakh exchange student Azamat
Tazhayakov guilty of obstruction of justice for removing a
backpack containing empty fireworks shells from Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts in
Dartmouth three days after the April 15, 2013 attack.

But in November, U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock warned
the Tazhayakov verdict could be called into question when the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled on a case involving a Florida fisherman
who was convicted of tampering with evidence for disposing of
undersized red grouper fish.

The high court on Wednesday overturned that conviction.

In John Yates vs. United States of America the Supreme Court ruled that a Florida fisherman who was convicted of destroying evidence after he threw undersized grouper back into the ocean, which were illegal to catch, bore little to no resemblance to the more serious crime this law was written as a result of - the shredding of documents at Enron. 

'I think Mr. Tazhayakov has a very good chance of being
exonerated,' said attorney Nicholas Wooldridge. 

'I'm ready to
buy the champagne but not to pop the cork.'

Woodlock wrote in a November order delaying sentencing for
both Tazhayakov and fellow Kazakh exchange student Dias
Kadyrbayev, who pleaded guilty to the same charge, that both
Tazhayakov's conviction and Kadyrbayev's plea could be affected
by the Supreme Court's decision.

What's more, if the two face no charges, the prosecution will have no way to use them as witnesses by offering a deal. 

Attorneys for Kadyrbayev did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.

An obstruction of justice conviction carries up to a 20-year
prison sentence.

At the time of Tazhaykov's conviction, his attorneys called
the decision unfair, saying it reflected a high level of emotion
in the city that was the site of the largest mass-casualty
attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001.

Neither of the two men were charged with having played any
role in the attack, which killed three people and injured 264.

Jury selection is currently underway for Tsarnaev's trial on
charges tied to the attack. He could face the death penalty if
convicted.

The case of a third college friend of Tsarnaev's, Robel
Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who was convicted in
October of the lesser charge of lying to investigators would not
be affected by the Supreme Court's ruling, Woodlock wrote in
November.

Attorneys for Phillipos rejected that assertion, saying they
believed Wednesday's decision also made their client's
conviction questionable.

'The decision will have significant bearing in Robel
Phillipos' case as it relates to the materiality of the alleged
false statements,' attorneys Derege Demissie and Susan Church
wrote in a statement.
