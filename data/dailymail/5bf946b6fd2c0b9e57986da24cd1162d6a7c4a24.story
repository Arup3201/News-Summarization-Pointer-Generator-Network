Councils will be banned by law from fining families who put their bin out at the wrong time or do not close the lid.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has lashed out at rules which allow so-called ‘Talibin’ officials to target law-abiding householders who make genuine mistakes.

Instead, local authorities will be restricted to issuing penalties to those who commit a ‘public nuisance’ by allowing bags to pile up or who fly-tip their rubbish.

New law: Councils will be banned by law from fining families who put their bin out at the wrong time or do not close its lid

Mr Pickles said yesterday that, under the previous Labour government, Whitehall bureaucrats had too much leeway to fine householders for minor breaches.

He added: ‘For too long Labour’s barmy bin rules have allowed local authorities to slap fines on law-abiding people who make innocent mistakes.

‘Putting out your rubbish should be a simple process, and it is ludicrous that we have a system where a milk carton in the wrong recycling container or a wheelie bin a few inches out of place can lead to people facing similar fines to shoplifters.

‘We’re bringing common sense back with a new law to rein in bin bullies which ensures that councils only issue fines to persistent and deliberate offenders.’

In 2005, the Labour government introduced fixed penalty notices of up to £110 for offences of putting rubbish out on the wrong day, not closing the bin lid, placing a rubbish bag next to a full wheelie bin, or putting recyclable goods out with normal rubbish.

Meanwhile, the penalty for shoplifters who stole goods worth under £100 was only £80.

From July 1, a change will be made to the Deregulation Bill, which mainly reduces the burden of excessive regulation on businesses, to ensure fixed penalty notices are handed out to householders only in cases where there has been ‘harm to the local amenity’.

Mr Pickles said the strict rules have been disproportionately hitting law-abiding people, while under Labour only 0.05 per cent of genuine fly- tipping incidents were ever successfully prosecuted by local authorities.

Under the amendments to the Bill, householders can be fined only if they cause a nuisance, damage the local area – such as those who allow stinking rubbish to pile up outside their house, or repeatedly fail to comply with the rules.

The Government has also promised to help bring back weekly bin collections, but this has not happened widely.

Despite putting up a £250million fund to encourage councils to collect bins once a week rather than once a fortnight, only 85 councils have applied for the cash.
