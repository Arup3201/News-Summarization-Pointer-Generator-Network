A Swedish man has had his rape conviction overturned – after an appeal court heard the attack may have been the result of ‘sexsomnia’.

Mikael Halvarsson was cleared of the charge after experts said he had no memory of the alleged assault and was asleep during the incident.

Halvarsson was accused after a woman called police claiming she had been attacked on April 2 this year, court documents reveal.

Translated court documents revealed that they had been sleeping in the same bed with separate blankets,abcNews reports.

It adds that Halvarsson was still asleep in her bed when police arrived.

But Sundsvall appeals court heard how a previous girlfriend said he had once tried to have sex with her while she was sleeping and that he had acted confused when she stopped him. 

Along with this testimony, Halvarsson’s mother confirmed that he had suffered from disturbed sleeping patterns in the past, the documents revealed.

Sexsomnia is a sleep disorder in which people engage in sexual behaviour while they are asleep – and have no recollection later of the acts they performed. 

The website quotes Dr Kingman Strohl, a professor of medicine and director of research at the Sleep Center at Case Medical Center in Cleveland, as saying sexsomnia is a medical diagnosis.

Dr Strohl, who is unconnected to court case in Sweden, said: 'Usually people are very scared and also quite confused as to what's going on.'

He added that doctors would ‘look for signs’ of the patient’s behaviour in their past adding that the condition is rare.
