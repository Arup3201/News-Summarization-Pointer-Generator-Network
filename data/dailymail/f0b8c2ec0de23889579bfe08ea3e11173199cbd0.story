Diego Simeone has signed a new contract at Atletico Madrid that will keep him at the club until 2020.

The current Spanish champions have long since made it clear they want the Argentine coach to be ‘their Sir Alex Ferguson’ and build an empire in Madrid. 

And finally on Monday negotiations concluded with Simeone’s sister and agent, Natalia, over a new deal that extends his current commitment to 2017 by three years and raises his annual net salary to £4.4m.

Simeone has pledged his future to Atletico for the next five years, with the aim of building an empire 

The contract includes a clause allowing him to leave at the end of a season for reduced compensation

All but confirming he had received offers from other clubs Simeone said: ‘I have chosen to stay here because the club is growing. 

'It is strong and that fills me with enthusiasm. In life it is difficult to choose sometimes but I am sure about the decision I have taken.’

Confirmation of Simeone’s loyalty to the club where he won La Liga last season will disappoint a clutch of Premier League clubs interested in his services but the deal is believed to include a clause that would allow him to leave for a reduced compensation package if he did so at the end of any given season. 

Atletico Madrid are now 20 per cent owned by Chinese corporation Wanda and Simeone has been told money will be available in the summer without the need to cash in on top players as in previous seasons. 

He has already made a summer shortlist of transfer targets and recouping Chelsea full-back Felipe Luis and signing Villarreal striker Luciano Vietto are part of it.

Simeone led Atletico Madrid to the Champions League final last year and has been on the radar of both Manchester United and Manchester City in the past year and Chelsea before they hired Jose Mourinho for a second time.
