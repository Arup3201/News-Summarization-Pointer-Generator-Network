The Archers is billed as ‘an everyday story of country folk’, but its rural delights have taken root on the internet to make it the BBC’s most downloaded radio show.

Topping a list of the corporation’s most popular podcasts in August, the Radio 4 soap about life in the fictional village of Ambridge was downloaded 1.87million times.

This put it above Mark Kermode and Radio 4 imon Mayo’s popular film review podcast on Radio 5Live, which had 1.6million downloads, and Desert Island Discs with 1.29million.

While it topped the list for August, overall The Archers is the second most successful BBC podcast of all time, downloaded 63million times since 2007. Top of the list is Radio 4’s Friday Night Comedy podcast, with 70million downloads overall.

The total number of Archers addicts is far higher, with an average of 5.1million listeners tuning in live on Radio 4 every week, and others choosing to listen by streaming it on the BBC iPlayer website.

Those who download the podcast are able to catch up with the latest episodes at their convenience on their mobile phones or tablet computers.

The Archers first topped one million monthly downloads in January last year, when the show’s popular characters Paul Crawford and his sister-in-law Lilian Bellamy were in the midst of an affair.
