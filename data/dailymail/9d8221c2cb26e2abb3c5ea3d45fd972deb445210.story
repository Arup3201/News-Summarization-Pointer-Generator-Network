An army of ants were stranded in a tree until they decided to build their own bridge by climbing on top of each other.

The quick-thinking insects wanted to reach the higher branches but found they could go no further.

Instead of giving up and climbing back down, the determined ants made their own bridge to get to the other parts of the tree.

The insects, which are two millimetres long and golden in colour, locked legs and worked together to slowly extend off the branch to make a ten centimetre bridge.

Photographer Adhi Prayoga snapped the ants in his friend's garden in Mataram, Indonesia.

The 42-year-old said: 'I took the pictures after spotting a weaver ants nest in the leaves and small trees in my friend's back garden.

'There were hundreds of ants and they managed to build a bridge about ten centimetres long - it was fascinating.

'They were building a bridge to the higher branches and worked together to make sure it was secure.'

Mr Prayoga, from Mataram, Indonesia, was impressed with their work and revealed they had a 'strategy'.

He added: 'The weaver ants had a strategy and one by one, each ant filled its place on the bridge.

'Sometimes they failed to form a part of the bridge and made mistakes, but after repeating the move, they were successful.

'They were extremely fast and made the bridge within a matter of seconds.

'I was very impressed with the strength of the ants and the photographs show how hard working they are.'
