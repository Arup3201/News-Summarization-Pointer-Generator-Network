A NSW Police dog named Marco made headlines this week for saving the life of a missing man, after finding him stuck in a river and clinging to a tree in an area that had already been searched.

Now another police dog has conducting another incredible rescued in in strikingly similar circumstances, after NSW Police dog Ulrich saved an elderly man who disappeared from hospital .

On Monday, an 86-year-old man went missing from Maitland Hospital and a desperate three-day long search ensued.

The man has been identified as Herbert 'Nobby' Bartlett and he had been in hospital recovering from a stroke he suffered six weeks ago, according to The Daily Telegraph. 

After four days missing he was found a mere eight minute walk from the hospital on Bonar Street, thanks to a dog who assumed his duties on Thursday morning and led police straight to the site.

Central Hunter Local Area Command had searched a number of towns using a great number of resources, including police officers, the SES and the Dog Unit.

One of these dogs became an unassuming hero - a two-year-old German Shepherd named Ulrich. 

For almost four days Mr Bartlett was lost and disorientated laying helplessly in tall grass next to a lake.

Police had already searched the area and surrounds numerous times but did not locate the lost man. 

However on Thursday morning, Ulrich was called in to investigate and reportedly led police straight to Mr Bartlett, locating the lost man by 11am. 

Fortunately, Mr Bartlett's condition reportedly had not deteriorate significantly despite his ordeal, according to The Daily Telegraph.

The remarkable rescue came just days after an almost identical black German Shepherd saved an elderly man in similar circumstances . 

Police dog Marco found a dementia patient in an area that had also been scoured by police on the Central Coast - just an hour away from Ulrich's rescue in Maitland. 

Police were called to an aged care home at Mardi, on the NSW Central Coast, on Saturday night after a 65-year-old dementia patient was reported missing.

The man had failed to return to the Wyong Aged Care Facility after going outside earlier in the day.

One police dog - Marco – who was searching near the river repeatedly led his attached officer Senior Constable Patrick Summers to a specific spot on the river's steep embankment that had previously been searched with no luck.

Snr Const Summers searched through the area's thick foliage and found the man stuck in the water and hidden behind a branch he was clinging onto just before 1am on Sunday.

'Even when I was right on him, I had my torch on him, I still couldn't make him out until I began shouting his name and there was a bit of movement and I thought "wow",' he told the Daily Telegraph.

'Marco was persistent in leading me there.'

Police said the man was in too much shock to call out, and would not have been able to hold on overnight putting him at risk of hypothermia or drowning.

The man was rescued and treated for minor injuries by paramedics on the scene.
