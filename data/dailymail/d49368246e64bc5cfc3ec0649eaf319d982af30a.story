Benefits Street star White Dee is currently living it up on Majorca, but had her sunny spell darkened by an alleged assault earlier this week.

However, if these images are anything to go by, she would have given as good as she got, had she had the chance.

White Dee, real name Deirdre Kelly, was seen throwing an entire bucket of ice over a fellow holiday maker as she enjoys the perks of her new fame in Magaluf.

Ice, ice baby: White Dee attacks a fellow fun-timer with an entire bucket of ice while attending a pool party in Magaluf, Majorca

Ms Kelly, 42, was seen talking to the younger man by a cask used as a table, stacked with plastic cups full of colourful drinks.

Lifting up the bucket of ice towards her companion, she decided to give him a cooling off, and threw the contents over his shoulder.

Fortunately for Ms Kelly, the 'victim' seemed to take it all in his stride, laughing as she walked off, cigarette sticking out of her mouth.

It is believed these photographs were taken before she was attacked by a man at the hotel, where she was hosting a Carnage Pool Party.

White Dee was allegedly 'kicked in the back of the head and hurled into a swimming pool' by a British man working on the island.

Here we go: It soon becomes clear, White Dee is set to pull a cold prank on the man in front of her

Cooling off: The man appears to have at least caught a few ice cubes in his glass, with the rest of the bucket trickling down his shoulders

Ms Kelly struggled to swim as the man's friends filmed the incident, pointing and laughing.

Police
 have retrieved CCTV from the Spanish hotel complex and launched an 
urgent appeal for witnesses of the alleged assault - which left Dee with
 whiplash.

Today, Dee, 42, was to meet with organisers to discuss potential compensation for her injuries.

The
 so-called 'attacker', a British promoter in his 20s working on the 
island, has been fired and will be questioned by police today.

Meanwhile Dee now intends to press charges.

Dee
 was hosting a four-hour pool party
 followed by a six-hour bar crawl at the holiday resort.

Playful: The sisters get into a water fight as they cool off from the intense Spanish sun

Splashing around: Dee jokes around with her sister. Later that day the mood turned sour when she was pushed in a pool

It comes just a month after she sparked 
outrage after being pictured drinking champagne in a VIP area as part of
 a £10,000 promotional holiday.

But while posing for pictures,
 she was approached by the man who ran up the full length of the pool 
before launching himself at her and hitting her in the head with his 
knee.

Both fell into the pool and the reality star was left trying to doggy-paddle.

Suffering whiplash, she was then forced to miss the six-hour bar crawl.

Her agent Barry Tomes, who witnessed the assault, told MailOnline: 'Thankfully Dee can swim.

'But as far as we are concerned this is clearly an assault and we called the police immediately.

'Dee intends to make an assault charge. '

Careful! The reality star nearly loses her strapless top when she jumps into the sea after her ride on the dinghy

Brrr! It looks like the water is colder than expected as Dee, wearing a life jacket, lowers herself into the water

'This man ran up behind her, kicked her in the back of the head, and she fell in the pool.

'She is now feeling very distressed and shaken up. She has a sore head and a bruised arm.

'It isn't fair, she's a real person. Dee takes a lot of flack and takes it in good stead, but this was horrible.

'There wasn't a lifeguard and she was never going to go in the pool.

'I
 just felt embarrassed by Brits abroad. The staff at the hotel and my 
American business partner were horrified by these boisterous 18- to 
25-year-olds. 

'This guy just wanted to be the big cheese and he's left Dee feeling so shaken.

'I hope she will be feeling well enough for the next few things we've got lined up back home.'

Dee and Mr Tomes has planned on meeting with with organisers to discuss potential compensation.
