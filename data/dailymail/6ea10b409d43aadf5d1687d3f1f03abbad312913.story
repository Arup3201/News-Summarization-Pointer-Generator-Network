GoDaddy pulled the plug on its Super Bowl commercial starring Buddy the golden retriever puppy Tuesday evening after getting an earful from furious animal rights activists.  

The domain name company released the ad Tuesday - five days before it will be viewed by more than 100million people during the Patriots and Seahawks game - and it was roundly criticized for apparently making light of puppy mills. 

The advert opens with the nine-week-old pooch riding in the back of a truck, as it parodies Budweiser's commercials featuring a dog and its Clydesdale horses.

But instead of enjoying the view, Buddy is thrown from the bed of the truck and he faces a treacherous journey home across train tracks and bridges and through mud and rain. 

Don't be fooled: GoDaddy's 2015 Super Bowl advert, which was revealed on Tuesday, opens with Buddy the puppy looking out from the bed of a truck - but it soon takes a dark turn

Plot twist: The truck hits a rock and the golden retriever puppy is thrown from the back of the truck

Finally, he sees his owners' farm and runs towards them, as they open their arms in joy.

But it's no happy ending: the only reason they're glad to seem him is because they've sold him on a website they set up with the help of GoDaddy.

The pup is promptly put in a van and driven away by GoDaddy spokesperson and racing star Danica Patrick.

Viewers of the video have responded with shock and disgust. 

'Poking fun at a puppy mill is not a laughing matter,' wrote Mick Magnuson. 'And I hope they get bombarded with calls and emails letting them know how disgusting the commercial is.'

'What kind of monster do they have running their marketing department? #GoDaddyPuppy Tasteless, horrid, shameful,' Kate Thomas tweeted.

Message received: It did not take GoDaddy long to do an about-face in response to an avalanche of vitriol 

GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving posted a statement  addressing the firestorm swirling around the Buddy ad

Some customers even messaged the domain service to say they would no longer be registering websites with them again. 

It did not take GoDaddy long to do an about-face in a bid to be back in the good graces of their customers and the public at large.

At around 7pm Eastern Time, the company sent out a tweet reassuring their critics that their message was heard 'loud and clear,' and that GoDaddy is changing course on the ad. 

GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving posted a statement on the company's blog addressing the firestorm swirling around the Buddy ad, saying that its goal was to 'increase awareness' of the company's commitment to helping small businesses build an online presence.

'However, we underestimated the emotional response,' Irving conceded.

The CEO added that his company still plans to run a commercial during the Super Bowl that would make fans laugh, but he did not elaborate on its content. 

According to TMZ, the domain name giant shelled out $4million for its 30-second slot in the lineup.  

Irving concluded his 'mea culpa' titled, 'We're Listening, Message Received,' by reassuring animal rights activists that Buddy the dog came to GoDaddy from a 'reputable and loving' breeder in California, and that he is now part of the 'GoDaddy family' as the company's 'Chief Companion Officer.'

A petition created on Change.org demanding that GoDaddy pull the Buddy ad has drawn more than 42,000 signatures as of Tuesday night.   

On track: Buddy, who was nine-weeks-old when they shot the commercial, tries to find his way home

Treacherous: In other scenes, he cowers in the cold as he tries to get back to his family's farm

When the now-scrapped TV spot was unveiled on the Today show Tuesday morning, the hosts were shocked.

'Me no likey,' Natalie Morales said as her co-hosts sat in silence.

Savannah Gurthie added: 'I don't know how people are going to feel about that.'

'Oh, I know how they're going to feel about it,' Matt Lauer said.

But some saw the funny side.

'My first thought was, this isn't funny, but it got so weird I couldn't not laugh! Funny commercial,' Darren McPhee wrote on Twitter.

In a statement to AdWeek Tuesday evening, PETA Director Colleen O’Brien praised GoDaddy for yanking the ad.

'GoDaddy did the right thing by swiftly promoting adoption. PETA’s message is that when you buy a dog from a pet store or a breeder, a dog in an animal shelter dies,' said O'Brien.  

Last year, GoDaddy's commercial featured a woman who quit her job so she could work as a puppeteer full time.

Reunited: But when Buddy finally makes his way back home, his owners have some unexpected news

Bye, Buddy! The pup has been sold via a website they set up with the help of GoDaddy

Heartbreaking: Buddy is driven away by GoDaddy spokesperson Danica Patrick to his new home 

In 2013, the company's advert featured model Bar Refaeli kissing a geeky actor, to show how the domain-name registrar mixes smart and sexy.

Ahead of this year's reveal, Gerry Graf of Barton F. Graf 9000, the advertising company behind the ad, had told AdWeek they would be 'playing with Super Bowl clichés'.

'There seems to be five puppy ads every year,' he said 'So, we're going to go hang out and play in that area.'

But he warned: 'It's not going to be sappy.'

Anger: Viewers took to Twitter to complain about the advert. The company said it was parodying other Super Bowl adverts featuring puppies - but viewers said there was nothing funny about puppy mills

Annoyed: Laura Nativo, a pet trainer and host, also vented her anger on Twitter on Tuesday
