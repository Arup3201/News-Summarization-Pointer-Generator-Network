The Glamour Women Of The Year Awards ceremony attracted a sea of famous faces and A-listers on Wednesday night - many of which snapped up free Pandora jewels at the event.

Now in its tenth year, the bash attracted a stellar list of guests with winners including Rita Ora, Samantha Barks, The Saturdays, Miranda Hart, Nicole Scherzinger, Myleene Klass, Jessie J, Rebel Wilson and Victoria Beckham.

Victoria turned out to collect her Woman on the Decade gong while hot property Samantha Barks arrived to collect the Breakthrough award on the arm of new beau David Gandy.

Celebrities were given giant goodie bags worth £3,000 filled with 70 gifts including an Aspinal of London notebook, £100 My-wardrobe voucher, St Tropez and Sanctuary beauty treats, a Pandora Gold Heart Ring and much more. Even guests walked away with £300 goodie bags.

Celebrities and VIPs were later invited to choose additional pieces from sponsor of the event Pandora's tower - a giant block 
filled with jewellery.
