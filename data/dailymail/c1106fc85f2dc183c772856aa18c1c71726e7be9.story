There are simply no excuses for England not performing on Saturday. This group of players have been together in camp for more than a month and they should be able to recite the patterns and game plan they’re looking to deliver in their sleep.

The coaches should have been able to get their message across by now. If they haven’t, there’s a problem. For Stuart Lancaster and his team the time is now, not tomorrow, not next year, not the 2019 World Cup. Now.

I have heard far too much talk about this being a young team with one eye on the next World Cup. I’ve heard that players are learning the ropes of international rugby and building on the experience. It’s time to stop talking like that. 

Stuart Lancaster's England team must deliver against the Wallabies at Twickenham on Saturday 

Lancaster has left experienced players such as Saracens winger David Strettle out of his recent plans

This is Lancaster’s team. He selects it, he coaches it. They are his picks and anyone selected for England should be ready to deliver. International rugby is not a training ground.

There are experienced players such as David Strettle, Chris Ashton and Danny Cipriani playing very well for their clubs but Lancaster has opted for youth with players such as Jonny May, Anthony Watson and George Ford in the back line and Rob Webber and Matt Mullan up front.

You can’t then use that inexperience as an excuse for poor performances and bad results. Indeed, it is these supposedly inexperienced guys who have been the highlights of the autumn to date.

This is Lancaster’s team and they need to start performing.

In many ways I think international rugby has become distracted by World Cups.

Yes, it is the biggest, most prestigious prize in the game and winning the World Cup is incredible. It is the ultimate but I cannot overstate just how much I used to love beating the big teams at Twickenham or in their own backyard —none more so than Australia. History shows the best way to prepare for a World Cup is to prove you are the best team in the world. That is only achieved with the attitude of every game being a must-win match. I fear this attitude has been lost. 

England will have their hands full containing the outstanding Wallabies fullback Israel Folau (above)

There will be 82,000 people at Twickenham to watch one of sport’s greatest rivalries. It doesn’t get much bigger than England against Australia. Compare this contest with the lukewarm qualification matches the England football team have to play. Test match rugby is amazing.

Of course, everything has been put into perspective by the tragic death of young Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes and when things like that happen it makes everyone sit back and take stock.

But I’m sure Hughes, brilliant sportsman that he was, would have wanted his friends in the Wallaby dressing room to put on a great show against an England team who have not shown any real sign of progress so far this autumn.

Some observers have pointed to the fact that England have faced the two strongest teams in the world and only been narrowly beaten.

George Ford impressed for England against the Samoans in difficult conditions at Twickenham 

I hear that, but my problem is with how they have played. It’s their performance that is the real issue: we’ve only seen a couple of flashes of individual brilliance.

We need a display that will get the Twickenham crowd — and the watching millions — on their feet.

There are two ways England can win this game. The first would be if the Australian scrum doesn’t turn up and we win the game through penalty tries, sin bins and three-pointers.

I hope this doesn’t happen, not just for the sake of the Twickenham crowd, but because it will merely paper over the cracks. The second is through great confrontation up front and swift, decisive execution in the backs.

This is a massive game for Ford at 10. The fly-half is the general of the side and I want to see him bossing today’s game in precisely the same way he does for Bath.

In Owen Farrell, Cipriani and Stephen Myler he is keeping some very good players out of the side but he is absolutely capable of leading this England team. I expect the England pack to be the defining factor and to smash Australia up front, but this in no way diminishes Ford’s influence on the game.

England have the forward muscle and the set-piece to strangle a suspect Wallabies pack on Saturday 

Ford and Ben Youngs have to take responsibility for setting up dynamic, fast carries, encouraging off-loads and establishing real momentum up front.

Where Ford stands apart from the other England 10s is his quick feet and ability to operate in the traffic close to the gain line. He has a superb eye for the break and a beautiful passing game. Look for him to attack the gain line only to drop the ball off to a charging Billy Twelvetrees or, better still, flick the ball behind his centres to his back three running at pace — all within touching distance of Bernard Foley and Matt Toomua.

When he finds himself on the move in the outer channels he makes the right decision more often than not. He can get Twickenham rocking.

There’s no doubt Farrell has been way below his usual high standards this autumn but he’s a world-class performer and I’m sure, given the chance to get some match fitness away from the glare of international rugby, he’ll rediscover his form. So Ford needs to deliver.

It’s also a big game for Youngs. The Leicester scrum-half has not quite delivered on the early promise of his career but he still has time on his side and there’s no doubt he’s a terrific talent.

I saw Nick Evans’s comments this week about his Harlequins team-mate Danny Care being made a scapegoat for England’s stuttering displays and, to a certain extent, I agree.

Sir Clive feels Brad Barritt (right) may not have the skillset to operate at outside centre for England 

Care’s game is based on tempo and quick ball, so replacing him with Youngs is an admission that they’re not looking to play the all-court attacking game that made them so dangerous in last season’s Six Nations.

Youngs brings different qualities and it’s essential his box kicking and breakdown marshalling are on the money.

I’d have liked to have seen England persist with Farrell at 12 because I think that combination with Ford could still work. But by bringing in Twelvetrees at inside centre, Lancaster and his coaches have stuck to the principle of selecting two playmakers in their inside back division.

Toulon's Matt Giteau no longer features for the Wallabies but he remains one of the best in the business 

His kicking game will compliment Ford’s but together they must be inch perfect because, in Israel Folau, Australia have a full back capable of doing serious damage from broken field.

He is a superb athlete and England just cannot afford to give him space by kicking too deep or failing to chase effectively. 

It’s an area of England’s game that has been surprisingly poor so far this autumn and it’s critical they get that right. I don’t believe Brad Barritt — for all his many qualities — is the right man to play outside them at 13 but at least with Ford and Twelvetrees on the pitch England have two players who can put width on the ball and create chances.

I’ve no doubt England’s forwards will provide plenty of ball. Will their backs have the wit to finish those chances?

Their opponents are the masters of threequarter play. In many ways it’s a shame Matt Giteau won’t be here to light up Twickenham because I still believe the Toulon fly-half is the best threequarter in world rugby. But with Foley, Quade Cooper, Kurtley Beale, Folau, Toomua and Nick Phipps on the team sheet we should be as concerned as we are excited to see Australia in action.

I’ve been really impressed with Toomua so far on this tour, while Foley and Phipps are an intelligent half-back pairing.

Ford and Twelvetrees have been picked primarily for their attacking potential but with Toomua and Foley opposite, both men will have to be on their mettle defensively.

Twelvetrees was exposed badly in that department last year when Toomua barrelled straight over him for Australia’s try and he has yet to convince me that physically he is robust enough in that position.

England captain Chris Robshaw (left) will face the might of Wallabies openside MIchael Hooper on Saturday 

Ford, who coped admirably with everything Samoa threw at him last week, can also expect to be targeted. I’m a huge fan of Michael Cheika as a coach and Australia will be inventive and hard to defend against. Flanker Michael Hooper is also a wonderful player who impresses me at every juncture. His clash with Chris Robshaw will be great viewing.

Both sides have lost their two important games this autumn and will be desperate for a win.

For England, their next game is on a Friday night against Wales in Cardiff in February. Get it wrong again today and it’s going to be a miserable Christmas for Lancaster and his team.

What a great Test match we have in store. The time is now, England.
