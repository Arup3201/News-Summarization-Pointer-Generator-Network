Hot for teacher: Kalyn Thompson gave a failing student an A average after having sex with him, police said

An Oklahoma English teacher is in trouble for giving a failing student an A - after he told police they had sex multiple times.

Kalyn Thompson, 25, is accused of having sex multiple times with an 18-year-old student in an English class she taught at Kellyville High School until she resigned in mid-April, according to reports. 

The student in question flunked English during the fall semester, when she started sexting him, but miraculously turned it around to a 98 per cent during the spring semester in which he also turned 18, according to KJRH.

Thompson was charged with second-degree rape because a teacher in Oklahoma is not allowed to have a sexual relationship with a current or former student until that person reaches the age of 21 despite the age of consent being only 16, the station noted.

She resigned earlier this year upon finding out an investigation into her extracurricular activities had begun, and told school officials she had been texting the student in a ‘sexual nature.’

There were also texts discussing ‘getting high’ exchanged between the teacher and her student, cops said.

Investigators questioning the student discovered they began talking outside the classroom in December and became sexually active in March, shortly after the student turned 18, sources told KJRH.

The pair had sex at least twice. Once at a nearby lake and then again at a hotel in Tulsa, according to KOTV.

They were also seen together in town having dinner and in her pickup truck, the station said.

‘You send your kids to small town schools thinking they’re going to get a better education because there’s more one on one,’ parent Michael Sullivan told KJRH. ‘You don’t expect to hear about a teacher messing with a student.’

Thompson was being held in Creek County Jail until she bailed out on a $35,000 bond.
