A 33-year-old New York man has been charged with manslaughter over the beating death of his wife's grandson.

Poseidon Quinones, 3, was killed by blunt trauma to the torso after being found unresponsive in his bed early Saturday morning in the Bronx.

The little boy lived with his paternal grandmother, Madeline Yensi, 46, in an apartment on 163rd St in Southview and had bruises on his head and all over his body.

On Thursday Fernando Yensi, Mrs Yensi's husband, was arrested and charged with Poseidon's death, according to NBC New York, however the full details of what happened to the toddler have not been released.

Beaten to death: Poseidon Quinones, 3, was killed by blunt trauma to the torso after being found unresponsive in his bed at his grandmother's apartment in the Bronx on Saturday morning

Charged: Fernando Yensi, 33, was arrested and charged with manslaughter Thursday over the death of his step grandson, Poseidon Quinones 

Mrs Yensi is the mother of Poseidon's father, Benjamin Quinones, 23.

In a disturbing twist, Mr Quinones claims that Fernando Yensi, his stepfather, abused him as a child as well.

'He swung on me when I was 13 years old,' Mr. Quinones told The New York Times.

Mr Quinones said his mother threw him out of the house after the alleged abuse.

'I’ve been on my own ever since,' he said.

Mrs Yensi was cited by the city’s Administration for Children’s Services as being an 'inadequate guardian' in 1998.

The citation was from a 'lack of supervision' she had shown to a child in her car, The Times reported.

It is unclear how Mrs Yensi came to be approved to care for Poseidon.

She has not been charged over the boy's death.

Tragic: Poseidon had been in foster care and lived in a homeless shelter with his father before his grandmother became his guardian 

Poseidon’s mother, Ashley Ramirez, 21, alleges that the grandmother had been abusing the boy for some time.

Ramirez said she lost custody of her son after a fight with the boy’s father.

Before living with Yensi, Poseidon had been in foster care and also lived in a homeless shelter with his father.

Neighbors say they heard Mrs Yensi telling paramedics that Poseidon had been sick on the day he was found unconscious.
