More than a thousand former members and officials of Boy Scouts of America gathered this weekend to create a Christian-based alternative to the BSA.

Its goal is to counter what the new groups says is the 'moral free-fall' of the nation, and 'raise a generation of faithful husbands, fathers, citizens and leaders,' organizers told the national inaugural convention in Nashville, Tennessee.

The move comes in response to the Boy Scouts of America’s recent repeal of a restriction that denied membership to youth based on sexual orientation, which will take effect at the start of next year.

New group: Over 1,200 disgruntled former Boy Scouts of America officials descended on Nashville, Tennessee this weekend, in order to launch a new, 'Christian-based' alternative to the BSA, as it voted earlier this year to lift its ban on gay members

Christian centered: Trail Life USA is the culmination of months of planning and prayer following the Scouts¿ decision this summer to permit openly homosexual members, turning its back on more than 100 years of being biblically straight

1,200 people from across the United States met for a two-day conference to select the name, logo and uniforms of the new organization, now called Trail Life USA.

The group has captured widespread attention because of its other mission — to provide a robust alternative to the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).

Cofounder John Stemberg says the organization will have a 'prominent faith component' and become a 'masculine outdoor program to raise young men.'

'Most of us are coming from a highly-structured environment that has 103 years of culture and language and program and symbols… and we are starting from scratch,' he told NBC.

Decisions: This weekend members decided on a name and a logo for the new activity group

At the opening session, John Stemberger, chairman of the board of Trail Life USA, teased the crowd saying he would not be surprised if there were 'spies' from Grapevine, Texas — BSA’s home base — in the audience.

Trail Life USA’s name, drawn from more than 300 options, was carefully vetted and is intended not to be political or controversial, organizers said.

'Trail' refers to a pathway and being outdoors, but also symbolizes the passage of life, where there are moral choices, and right and wrong paths, said Mr. Stemberger.

'Our whole life is about the trail, both in the outdoors and in the journey of life as believers,' he said. 'So Trail Life is a way of life that is centered on following Christ in the outdoors.'

Founder: John-Stemberger began Trail Life USA in response to the Boy Scouts of America's decision to allow gay youths to remain in the scout movement

Organizers also unveiled the new Trail Life USA logo: It features a circle with a sun, mountaintops with a path, and a male figure with a hand extended over his head, beckoning others to follow.

Mr Stemberger, who founded OnMyHonor.net in response to BSA’s vote in May that reversed the organization's long-standing ban on openly gay youth among its ranks, says the organization will become 'a program that we believe will be stronger, safer and more principled in every way.'

He told NBC in July that, while the new organization would allow gay members, it would not permit them to 'flaunt' their sexual orientation.

'There is not going to be any kind of a witch hunt in our organization for people and what their sexual orientations are,' he clarified. We’re going to focus on sexual purity not sexual orientation.'

Zach Wahls, an LGBT activist, Eagle Scout, and founder of Scouts for Equality, was saddened by the departure of so many families from the BSA. He also questioned Trail Life USA’s intentions of allowing gay members.

Changes: Boy Scouts of America announced earlier this year that it is lifting the ban 
on gay members and thus allowing anyone regardless of their sexual 
orientation to enjoy the benefits of the youth programme

Angry: The decision, which still denies adults from serving as Scout 
leaders, has upset conservative groups who believe that 
gays should not be allowed in the BSA at all

'You still cannot discuss sexuality 
within the BSA,' Mr Wahls told NBC. 'That hasn't changed and that will 
not change, and so, it's really a distinction without a difference that 
they're trying to make here.'

'Scouting is for all young men,' Mr Wahls said.

Trail
Life USA will be inclusive of boys, regardless of religion, race, 
national origin or socioeconomic status, and accept boys who are 
experiencing same-sex attractions or gender confusion.

However,
it will not admit youth who are open or avowed about their 
homosexuality, and it will also not admit boys who are not 'biologically
male' or boys who wish to dress and act like girls.

The
new organization is modeled after the American Heritage Girls, an 
18-year-old organization that is 'Christ-centered' and is 'seen as an 
alternative to Girl Scouts,' according to the group's website.

Adult
leaders of Trail Life USA will be Christians who sign a statement of 
faith and submit to background checks. Both boys and adults will be 
required to adhere to a code of conduct.

The
goal is to 'become the premier organization that honors God and builds 
some great young men,' Mark Hancock, one of the board members told The Washington Times.
