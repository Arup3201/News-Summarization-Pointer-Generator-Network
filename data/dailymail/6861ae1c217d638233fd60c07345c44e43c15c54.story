Holidaymakers sunning themselves on the party island of Ibiza are being warned about a dangerous new drug which has been linked to disturbing acts of violence.

Police are concerned that the experimental substance – which has been connected to a gruesome attack in Miami – has made its way into the famous clubs and nightspots of the Balearic island.

Up all night: Police are worried that 'Cannibal' has infiltrated Ibiza's famous party scene

Detectives believe dealers in the party resort of San Antonio have been peddling the mind-bending narcotic to young revellers.

Officers trying to clear the streets of the mystery drug, blamed for a recent attack in which a British tourist had to be handcuffed after biting a policeman, have branded it 'Cannibal'.

Matilde Fernandez, a nurse at a health centre in San Antonio, says: ‘Fortunately he had gloves on and only suffered bruising.

‘Police had to call back up and we ended up with eight officers on the scene.'

Ibiza’s chief anti-drugs officer Alberto Arean says: ‘Our hope is that it was just a small batch and has now been consumed.’

Bath salts, which contain a powerful stimulant called MDPV, were blamed for the horrific attack by Rudy Eugene on homeless Ronald Poppo, 65, in Miami in June 2012 – although subsequent tests only showed up traces of marijuana.

Police shot Eugene, 31, dead after he chewed off three-quarters of his victim's face.

Magnet: San Antonio, on the west coast of Ibiza, is a magnet for young holidaymakers from across Europe

Earlier this month, health chiefs in Ibiza warned that British holidaymakers were being used as guinea pigs in the trialling of dangerous new drugs.

They claimed traffickers are playing with the lives of revellers by testing synthetic drugs on them – before peddling them around the rest of Europe.

Raul Izquierdo, a health officer for the Balearic islands, has warned that such drugs are ‘especially dangerous’ because of their ‘unknown side effects.’

He added: ‘Ibiza is the gateway, and the experimental laboratory for the new drugs that appear.’

Lethal stimulants Methylone and PMMA are among the most common seizures of new designer drugs on Ibiza in recent years, although marijuana and cannabin resin still top the confiscation tables.

Local authority figures shows that the number of drugs seizures in the Balearics Islands rose from 14,253 in 2012 to 18,640 last year.

Nail technician Jodie Nieman died in July 2011 at an Ibiza club after taking two ecstasy tablets.
