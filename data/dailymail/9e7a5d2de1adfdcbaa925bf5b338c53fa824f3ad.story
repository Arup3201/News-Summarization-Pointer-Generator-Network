Talented: Indiana University student and rowing team member Karlijn Keijzer died on flight MH17

A student at Indiana University is among the victims on board passenger jet MH17, which was shot down over Ukraine Thursday.

Karlijn Keijzer, who lived in the Netherlands, was one of the 298 passengers and crew who died on the Malaysia Airlines flight to Kuala Lumpur.

Keijzer, who was studying for her PhD with the university, was described as a talented student who had been working on cancer treatments.

The 25-year-old, who also studied for her masters at the Indiana university in Bloomington, was taking a break from her studies for the summer vacation.

University president Michael McRobbie said Keijzer's death was a loss to the entire campus.

'Karlijn was an outstanding student and a
 talented athlete.

'Our hearts also go out to the families of all the victims of
 this senseless act,' he said.

As well as being part of the chemistry department Keijzer was a keen member of the varsity rowing team in 2011. The dedicated athlete had also won medals for European and world rowing championships in 2006 and 2007.

'She came to us for one year as a graduate student and truly wanted to 
pursue rowing. That year was the first year we really started to make a 
mark with the First Varsity 8 boat, and she was a huge reason for it,' head coach Steve Peterson said.

The
 25-year-old was one of 189 people from the Netherlands who perished 
when their plane was shot down over rebel-held Ukraine yesterday.

Keijzer's adviser for her doctorate said the young woman had been involved in several research projects related to improving health.

'The last piece of research work she 
completed before heading out to catch her flight to her short summer 
vacation was preparing a computer simulation on bryostatin, an 
anti-cancer drug and a promising drug candidate for treating Alzheimer's
 disease,' Mu-Hyun Baik said.

'She was a kind, happy young woman full of ideas about the future. She inspired us all with her optimism about how science will make Earth a better place.'

The Boeing 777 aircraft she had been traveling on was hit by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile over territory near Donetsk held by pro-Russian rebels who the Ukrainian government says are backed by the Kremlin.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed Ukraine for the attack.
