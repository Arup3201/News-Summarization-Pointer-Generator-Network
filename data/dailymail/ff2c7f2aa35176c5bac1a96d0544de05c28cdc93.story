Anyone can make themselves look good in an online profile photo. 

That gorgeous model you see on Twitter could simply be an illusion of lights, camera angle and filter action. Meet them in real life, and you might get a shock.

That hasn’t stopped apps such as ‘Bang with Friends’ or ‘Zoosk’, which focus heavily on photos, from gaining huge popularity with men. 

Now a free-to-use app, Twine, is hoping 
to offer to fill a niche in the market by providing the modern day 
alternative to a ‘blind date’.

Twine tries to match you up with three people per day in your age range and who share Facebook interests.

When you are matched with someone, it lets you chat with that person. 

At first, however, their Facebook profile picture is blurred out. But if the chat goes well, you can then choose to reveal your name and photos.

It even helps you think of conversation topics.

‘With our patent-pending ICE Breaker, Twine will suggest topics that will help you get to know the other person better,’ says the website.

The app maintains a policy that women and men must join the app in equal numbers. If your gender is over-represented, you have to go on a waiting list.

It was developed by San Francisco-based Sourcebits and is available on both iOS and Android.

Whether a dating site with no photos will catch on, however, remains to be seen.

Last month, a study published in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, found that men value women’s looks over other traits.

Women on the other hand, were more concerned about a man’s social status.

The study found that after chatting with the opposite-sex with both low and moderate levels of these traits, men, more than women, rejected and reported less attraction toward potential mates with low physical attractiveness.

Women, however, indicated similar aversion toward those with low social status.

According the study, men and women differ mostly on the low-end qualities that they want to avoid, not the high-end traits that they ideally desire.
