High Chaparral, winner of the 2002 Derby, has been put down at Fethard Equine Hospital, aged 15.

Trained by Aidan O'Brien, the son of Sadler's Wells proved two lengths too strong for 9-4 favourite and stablemate Hawk Wing at Epsom, being ridden to glory by Johnny Murtagh.

A tweet from Coolmore read: "High Chaparral has been euthanised at Fethard Equine Hospital during exploratory colic surgery due to a perforated intestine."

Mick Kinane elected to partner Hawk Wing at Epsom but was back on board for the Irish Derby at the Curragh, where High Chaparral was an easy winner from Sholokhov, leading home a 1-2-3 for Ballydoyle.

He did not run again until the Arc at Longchamp, in which he was third to Marienbard, and enjoyed further glory when travelling to Arlington Park in Chicago for the Breeders' Cup Turf.

O'Brien's star returned as a four-year-old, beating Falbrav in the Irish Champion Stakes, again finishing third in Arc, this time to Dalakhani, and then dead-heating with Johar in a pulsating Breeders' Cup Turf.

In total he won 10 of 13 career starts, earning almost £3.5million in win and place prize money.

At stud he has proved a successful stallion with his offspring including 2012 Sussex Stakes winner Toronado and top Australian horse So You Think.
