Martin O'Neill has told the Tartan Army that booing Aiden McGeady will have zero impact on the winger’s performance for Ireland.

Gordon Strachan stated last week that it was okay for fans to boo McGeady and James McCarthy – both born and raised in Scotland – as long as it was purely on footballing grounds.

Gordon McQueen then went much further, claiming the pair deserved a ‘horrible reception’ for deciding to represent the land of their grandparents.

McCarthy is a major injury doubt for Friday’s Euro 2016 showdown at Celtic Park but McGeady seems certain to be part of O’Neill’s starting line-up - and the Ireland boss has no doubt the 28-year-old will handle any flak sent in his direction.

‘He (McGeady) has chosen to play for Ireland, which is his prerogative,’ said O’ Neill. ‘At the time he chose, I may well have been his manager at Celtic. I have to say now that, although at the time I had absolutely nothing to do with his decision, I am absolutely delighted he chose to follow his forefathers from Donegal.

‘Remember that while the game is being played at Celtic Park it will not be made up necessarily all of Celtic-chanting supporters. [Booing or cheering] is the prerogative of fans to choose. But I don’t think it would have an impact on such a precocious kid.

‘It’s natural you would prefer people to applaud a piece of brilliance, rather than booing it, but he’s gained experience now and at the age he’s at I think he’ll take this in his stride.’

McCarthy will be assessed before the squad trains in Malahide this morning after sustaining a hamstring problem playing for Everton on Sunday, with O’Neill drafting in Stoke’s Glenn Whelan to bolster his options in midfield. Stoke centre-back Marc Wilson and back-up goalkeeper Kieren Westwood have been ruled out.

Meanwhile, Mark McGhee insisted Scotland ‘still have it all to prove’ after claiming our qualifying results fo far were no more than expected.

They have four points already from their opening games with Germany, Georgia and Poland, with their performances in each qualifier heightening the air of optimism that’s abounded since Gordon Strachan took charge almost two years ago.

However, pointing to the win and the draw Poland and Ireland took from their games against the world champions respectively, assistant McGhee believes Scotland still have much to do if they are to reach a first major finals in 18 years.

‘There’s been a lot of quite positive feedback but all we’ve achieved so far is the minimum expected of us. We’ve beaten Georgia at home, got a point away from Poland - which I think after beating Poland over there last year, people hoped we would get at least. That’s all we’ve got after we lost to Germany.

‘On the other hand, Ireland have a point more than maybe people expected, and they’ve beaten Georgia away which is still going to be a big ask for any of us. So we’ve still got it all to prove. If we can get a positive result we can start to believe we actually are on the up.

‘This is the most important game of our tenure. It’s a huge opportunity for both teams to take advantage. We could beat England 6-0 (in next week’s friendly) but it doesn’t get us to France. This is the game.’

Hearts defender Callum Paterson has been drafted in to replace likely absentee Phil Bardsley, with Johnny Russell deputising for injured Derby team-mate Craig Bryson.

Meanwhile, McGhee feels it’s unlikely Strachan will agree to Ally McCoist’s request for Lewis Macleod to be ‘loaned back’ to Rangers for their clash with Alloa on Saturday. ‘Like Callum Paterson, if Lewis Macleod comes and trains all week the way Stevie May did when he came, then I’d think Gordon won’t be releasing him,’ he said. ‘That’s a decision Gordon will make in conjunction with Ally towards the end of the week.’
