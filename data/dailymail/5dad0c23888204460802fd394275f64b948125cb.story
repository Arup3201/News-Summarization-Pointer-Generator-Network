Political parties spend 22 times more trying to buy the votes of people in crucial swing seats than other areas, new research shows.

For people living in Bootle on Merseyside, their votes are worth just 14p each when the election campaign rolls into town.

But winning over wavering voters in Luton South in Bedfordshire means each of them is worth £3.07, sparking claims ‘votes are not created equal after all’.

Battleground: Just 14p was spent on each vote in Bottle, but £3.07 in the hotly contested fight in Luton South. The darker green areas on the map are the seats where more money was spent trying to win over swing voters

The revelation is likely to reopen the row over the way the main parties target a tiny number of seats which decide the outcome of general elections.

It will also renew calls to redraw constituencies so that each seat has the same number of votes, ending the idea of seats remaining rock solid Labour or Tory.

The way that parties raise and spend funding has been making headlines again after it emerged the Tories and Lib Dems carved up a £520,000 donation left to the Government of the day.

The coalition parties have returned the money after it emerged Joan Edwards, 90, from Bristol wanted it to go to which ever political party was in power.

But they still face questions over big money donations, with the Tories accused of accepting £1million in three months from businesmen who were invited to dinner with the PM and Lib Dem donor James Palumbo, founder of Ministry of Sound, given a peerage weeks after writing a cheque for £65,000.

New figures this week also showed 
that 72 per cent of big donations to the Labour party came from just 
five trade unions, including £722,000 from Unite.

Some
seats are so safe that candidates spend almost nothing, because they 
are either certain or winning or know that campaigning will mean pouring
their money down the drain.

The Tories and Lib Dems today agreed to payback a £520,000 bequest to the nation left in an elderly spinster’s will.

The coalition parties came under fire after it emerged they carved up the money left by former nurse Joan Edwards to the Government to spend ‘as they may think fit’.

Instead
of using the money on the Health Service, schools or to ease the 
national debt, the Coalition shared it between them as a party donation.

But
after a furious backlash, including mounting criticism from their own 
MPs, David Cameron and Nick Clegg ordered their parties to return the 
money to government funds.

Miss
Edwards solicitors moved to end speculation today, claiming that 
despite the clear wording of her will, she had reassured them that she 
wanted the money to go to a political party.

The
row erupted after party said Miss Edwards, who was 90 when she died, 
had bequeathed the money to ‘whichever party’ was in power when she 
died.  The Daily Mail tracked down a copy of the will – which made no mention of any party.

In 195 seats – almost a third of the 650 contested in 2010 - no money was spent by any candidate on public meetings.

In five seats - Ruislip, Northwood and
Pinner, Sheffield Heeley, East Ham, Sheffield Brightside and 
Hillsborough, and Knowsley - no money was spent on advertising by any 
candidate.

And 348 candidates - 8.6 per cent of the total which stood for election - spent no money at all on their campaigns.

According
to research by the Electoral Reform Society, in the 50 most hotly 
contested seats spending per vote was 162 per cent higher than in the 50
safest seats.

Luton South, where Gavin Shuker won for Labour with a  majority of 2,239, saw the most spent for vote cast.

It followed a fierce battle for the seat vacated by Labour MP Margaret Moran following revelations about her expenses.

Aberconwy, Barking, Polra and Limehouse, Northampton North and Hampstead and Kilburn all saw more than £2 per vote spent.

By comparison Bootle, which was Labour’s safest seat until the 2010 election with a majority of more than 25,000, saw just 14p spent.

Labour's Joe Benton held the seat, with a majority of 21,181 over the Lib Dems.

In Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner, where Tory minister Nick Hurd is the MP, just 18p was spent.

Only 19p was spent in Tory safe seat South Leicestershire and 20p in Labour-held seats Halton and Sheffield Heeley.

Katie Ghose, chief executive of the 
Electoral Reform Society, said: ‘Elections in Britain have become the 
ultimate postcode lottery.

‘The
amount of money which parties spend on attracting your vote depends 
almost entirely on where you live.

'The fact that voters in Bootle are 
valued 22 times less than those in Luton South shows that all votes are 
not created equal after all.’

The study also shows how the political parties have given up on some areas altogether.

Ten least valued seats

For example, the Tories and Lib Dems spent no money at all in the Scottish seat of Motherwell and Wishaw.

Miss Ghosh added: ‘If you live in a marginal seat, then parties will spend money trying to attract your vote. But if you live in a safe seat – as so many people do – then you will be all but ignored.

If we are going to redress the imbalance, both party funding and our electoral system need to be reformed.

‘We need properly and sustainably funded political parties incentivised to campaign across the country, not just in a few fiercely contested seats.

‘We need a party funding system that recognises the crucial role that parties play in mobilising voters. And we need an electoral system that values each voter equally no matter where they live.’

However, all three parties have ruled out the idea of increased taxpayer funding for campaigning.
