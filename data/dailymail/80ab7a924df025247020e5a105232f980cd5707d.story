Thousands of Eurostar passengers are stranded again for a second day after a power outage was claimed to have brought the Channel Tunnel to a halt.

Travellers were hoping to take journeys they abandoned yesterday after the route was shut  by a lorry fire, causing chaos and triggering compensation bills running into the millions.

But just as services were back up and running, 11 more Eurostar trains with room for up to 8,000 people were cancelled.

Eurostar appeared to blame operator Eurotunnel - which issued a heated denial.

Cancelled: Another 11 Eurostar trains have been cancelled after the firm claimed there was a problem with the overhead power supply inside the Channel Tunnel which led to it being shut for two hours

Dispute: Eurostar appeared to blame Eurotunnel, which operates the route - but Eurotunnel denied it had experienced any power problems when called by MailOnline. 'No, we haven't,' said a spokesman

Trains were already only running through one of the twin tunnels today, while firefighters inspected possible damage to the other from yesterday's lorry fire.

That meant trains were having to run close together in batches in one direction before the line was cleared for a batch running in the opposite direction.

Eurostar said the only available tunnel had to be closed for two hours this morning after 'Eurotunnel experienced new power supply problems'.

But a Eurotunnel spokesman told MailOnline: 'No, we haven't. We've been running single-line services throughout the day as we said we would.

'[For Eurostar] there were issues with having to manage the timetable. As far as our business is concerned we said we would run single-line services throughout the day. We have done that and we continue to do that.

'The media are trying to create another event, another disruption, to services in the Channel Tunnel.'

Eurostar, however, stuck to its version of events - saying it believed the  problem involved overhead power lines inside the tunnel itself.

Queues: More than 100 stranded Eurostar passengers queued from 6am at London's St Pancras station today as they tried to rebook onto a train today. Many services were full as priority was given to previous bookings

Waiting around: Thousands of passengers were again left stranded in the St Pancras terminal today

Eurotunnel operates the tunnel itself and runs Le Shuttle, a car and freight service, through it.

It is true that the firm's timetable has not been disrupted today, because it was not running to a published timetable in the first place.

Instead passengers were told to turn up at their pre-booked time, to be put on the first available train.

At one point there was a five-hour wait, according to Eurotunnel's website, up from a predicted 90 minutes this morning.

By 5pm Eurotunnel passengers still faced a three-and-a-half hour wait for a train in Folkestone and a five-and-a-half hour wait in Calais. 

Six Eurostar trains from London, two from Paris and three from Brussels were cancelled today.

The cancelled departures from London St Pancras were the 2.04pm, 3.31pm, 5.04pm, 6.04pm, 6.31pm and 8.04pm.

The firm admitted some stranded passengers could face a second night away from home - with official advice being to avoid London's St Pancras station altogether and book for another day.  

A spokesman said: 'Eurotunnel experienced new power supply problems this morning which meant that both tunnels were again closed for two hours.

'This closure was a separate incident, unrelated to the problems experienced yesterday.'

French couple Etienne and Charlie Soren - whose train was cancelled yesterday - rebooked onto the today's 5.04pm  only to find it, too, had been wiped from the schedule.

'We made five phone calls yesterday to get places, but now we are told we have to start the process again because our train has been cancelled,' said Mr Soren, 35.

'I have never experienced anything like this. It is a disaster. Spending one more night here was okay, it was the weekend, luckily we could afford another night.

'Now we have come from the hotel with all of our luggage and baby things expecting to get on a train and they just say there is absolutely no way we are getting on another train.

'Now we have to spend money on a hotel. Flights would cost us hundreds of euros and we would have to wait until Eurostar decides to refund us. They should pay for our bills.

'I do not believe that they can't just put more trains on into the night. They say the service stops at 8pm - that is ridiculous. How are all these people ever going to get home?' 

Calm after the storm: The scene at 8.30am beyond the check-in terminals as those stranded headed home

Eurostar strongly advised passengers to come in person only if they were booked on a specific seat, with all trains delayed by up to an hour as one of the twin tunnels remained shut.

More than 100 people defied advice to queue up at London's St Pancras station from 6am to exchange yesterday's tickets, only to be told the next train was full.

But later the terminal at St Pancras was quiet as others appeared to have heeded advice not to turn up without a new booking. 

Staff insisted more services would be running tomorrow, with engineering works planned to take place overnight to make more sections of the tunnel functioning again. 

'Eurostar plans to run a full service and passengers are advised to check-in as normal.

'As Eurotunnel will not be completely operational Eurostar services may be subject to delays of up to about 30 minutes.,' a spokesman said. 

But the company is facing a compensation bill running into the millions for the widespread disruption over the past two days.  

Aside from the cost of refunding tickets and laying on an extra service at 8am today, it was offering passengers £250 - £50 for meals, £50 for taxis and £150 for a London hotel.

One passenger, photographer and musician Laurent Fritz, said: 'I arrived at St Pancras at 6:20am. There were around 150 people waiting to exchange tickets, but the service opened at 7am.

Eurostar bookings for today

Anyone who was already booked on a train for today (Sunday) will not lose their seat, unless it's on one of the cancelled services. Turn up as normal half an hour before departure.

Eurostar bookings from yesterday, or bookings cancelled today

Passengers need to refund their ticket or exchange it for another one. Passengers should call 03432 186 186 and are 'strongly advised' against going to the station in person.

How to claim compensation

Those stranded can claim £50 per night for taxis, £50 for meals and £150 for a London hotel. Receipts can be presented to Eurostar in person or in the post to claim the money back.

Eurotunnel bookings

Customers were offered a transfer to a ferry yesterday. If still stranded they should turn up today to exchange their ticket.

'At 7.30am they told us that the first train from St Pancras to Paris was full, so they added a new train with 800 seats for all passengers that couldn't leave London yesterday. 

'They were saying the train would leave at 9.05am.'

Services resumed on Eurotunnel at 2.45am UK time from Britain and 4.30am French time from France.

Empty trains were sent through the tunnel to ensure it was clear and customers were being offered transfers to ferries until the service restarted.

Previous delays on the car and lorry shuttle have forced Kent Police to implement Operation Stack, lining up thousands of vehicles along the M20 motorway as they wait for a departure.

A spokesman said: 'It's always in place ready to go but we are not expecting to have to do it today.'

One witness claimed passengers were given gas masks yesterday after two of the north tunnel's carbon dioxide alarms sounded at the French end just before noon.

A 'smouldering load' was found on board a truck which was being carried in one of the vehicle shuttles, and although the fire was not serious the tunnel is still being checked for damage.

Huge queues built up at St Pancras as services were cancelled and similar scenes were reported in Paris, with many holidaymakers forced to look for alternative transport or hotels. 

A Eurostar spokesman said: 'As Eurotunnel has advised us that its north tunnel will remain closed all day, Eurostar services will be subject to delays of between 30 and 60 minutes.

'All passengers who are booked to travel today (Sunday 18 January) should check-in as normal half an hour before departure.

'Services are already very busy and availability is limited. If you were on a cancelled train and need to travel urgently, please call our contact centre on 03432 186 186  and we will try to re-book you on a service departing after 12.00 (GMT).

'We would strongly advise passengers whose journeys were impacted by the problems in Eurotunnel not to come to our stations unless they have rebooked through our contact centre.

'We are sorry for the inconvenience that passengers have experienced.'
