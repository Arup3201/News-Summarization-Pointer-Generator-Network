Luis Suarez has started his pre-season training regime with a personal trainer in order to remain fit during his suspension.

The Barcelona striker is not allowed to use club staff or even a coach associated with his country's football association, so has hired his own man to prepare him for action.

Suarez, advised by his legal team to limit the amount of time he is seen publicly, is working with a detailed physical plan so he can fit into Luis Enrique's plans as soon as possible.

With the Court of Arbitration for Sport set to hear the Uruguayan's appeal in mid-August, Suarez wants to be at his physical peak when he is allowed to re-join his team-mates.

He is going to train in a discreet location and try to avoid being photographed, to prevent any misunderstandings with FIFA over his ban.

The forward has been banned from 'all football activity' for four months, after he bit Italian Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup.

Suarez has moved away from his in-laws house in Castelldefels somewhere nearby, where he is not being bothered by media and supporters who gathered where he was staying.

The striker had to organise the trainer on his own and Barcelona are not allowed to tweak his training schedule.

Barcelona hope that on appeal, even if the ban itself is not reduced in length, he will at least be permitted to train as normal at the club.

His ban ends on October 25, the day before Barcelona are set to face rivals Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu.

While Suarez prepares by himself, Barcelona are set to fly to England to train at St George's Park. The squad, including the likes of Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Gerard Deulofeu, but not Lionel Messi or Neymar, will arrive at Birmingham airport around mid-day on July 28.

They will train that evening at 6pm at St George's Park, where they will remain until August 2, when they fly to Nice, in France, for a friendly.
