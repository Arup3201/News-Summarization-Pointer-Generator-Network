THE curse of Tutankhamen is said to have claimed more than 20 lives. By contrast, the curse of Neb-Senu amounts to little more than an occasional inconvenience for museum curators.

Over several days, the ten-inch Egyptian statuette gradually rotates to face the rear of the locked glass cabinet in which it is displayed, and has to be turned around again by hand.

Those who like tales of haunted pyramids and walking mummies may regard the mystery of the 4,000-year-old relic – an offering to Osiris, god of the dead – as the strangest thing to hit Egyptology in decades.

Egyptologist Campbell Price studies an ancient Egyptian statuette at the Manchester Museum, which appears to be moving on its own

Others, including TV physicist Professor Brian Cox, have a more down-to-earth explanation for its movement.

Whatever the solution, the puzzle certainly won’t dent visitor numbers at its present home, Manchester Museum.

The statuette’s slow about-turn has 
been captured on film by a time-lapse camera, and curator Campbell 
Price, 29, says he believes there may be a spiritual explanation.

‘I noticed one day that it had turned
 around,’ he said. ‘I thought it was strange because it is in a case and
 I am the only one who has a key.

‘I put it back, but then the next day it had moved again. 

The 10-inch tall relic, which dates back to 1800 BC, has been at the museum for 80 years but curators say it has recently starting rotating 180 degrees during the day

‘In Ancient Egypt they believed that 
if the mummy is destroyed then the statuette can act as an alternative 
vessel for the spirit. Maybe that is what is causing the movement.’

The statue, made by one Neb-Senu in 
about 1800BC, was donated to the museum in 1933, and had been 
reassuringly immobile for most of that time.

However Mr Price and his 
colleagues are now used to finding it facing the rear of its case – 
perhaps significantly, displaying a prayer on the back requesting 
‘bread, beer, oxen and fowl’.

Experts decided to monitor the room on time-lapse video and were astonished to see it clearly show the statuette spinning 180 degrees - with nobody going near it

In this time lapsed video, as the museum closes for the evening, the statue can be seen in a clearly different position

By midday the next day it has turned almost a quarter of a circle to be facing to the left

The following morning the statue has moved again, and is facing even further away from its original position

By the end of the day the statue has turned almost 180 degrees and is now facing away from visitors to the museum

Their video has recorded it rotating 
to its left over the course of three days until facing backwards.

Even 
more mysteriously, it appears to spin only during daylight hours, and 
does not turn beyond 180 degrees. Some, including Professor Cox, have 
suggested that vibrations caused by the footsteps of passing visitors 
makes the statuette turn on its glass shelf.

Mr Price said: ‘Brian thinks it’s 
“differential friction” where two surfaces, the stone of the statuette 
and glass shelf it is on, cause a subtle vibration which is making the 
statuette turn. But it has been on those surfaces since we have had it 
and it has never moved before.

‘And why would it go a round in a perfect circle? It would be great if someone could solve the mystery.’
