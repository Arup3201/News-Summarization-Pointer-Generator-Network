Newcastle are hopeful of closing a deal for France international striker Bafetimbi Gomis.

Owner Mike Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley have been in negotiations with Gomis' representatives and it is understood only minor details need to be ironed out to conclude the transfer - which they hope can be completed on Monday.

Galatasaray have also shown an interest in the 28-year-old former Lyon forward who is a free agent but was looking for wages of around £100,000 a week.
