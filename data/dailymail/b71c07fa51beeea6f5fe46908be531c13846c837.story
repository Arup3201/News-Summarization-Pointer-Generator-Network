Lewis Hamilton is clearly itching to get back on the race track if his latest social media posting is anything to go by.

The 30-year-old, reigning Formula One champion, took to Facebook and Twitter to show fans how he quenches his thirst for speed during the off-season.

Hamilton gave followers a glimpse of his pride and joy as he posted a picture of him stood with his one-of-a-kind AMG powered Zonda in front of a picturesque view. 

Lewis Hamilton took great pride in showing off his £1.5m Zonda to his many fans on social media 

The one-off Pagani Zonda 760 LH boasts a top speed in excess of 200mph and costs a cool £1.5million

The Pagani Zonda 760 LH (yes, that really does stand for 'Lewis Hamilton') costs a cool £1.5million and boasts a top speed of 217mph. 

Indeed, the one-off design roars from 0-60mph in an eye-watering 2.6seconds.  

The Sports Personality of the Year Winner is clearly enjoying his free time having visited Paris earlier this week for a Louis Vuitton Menswear show.

But in just over a week's time the first pre-season test will be held in Jerez in preparation of the new F1 season, with Mercedes unveiling their car on the opening morning.

The test starts on February 1 and lasts a total of four days.

Hamilton will drive the W06 on the second and fourth days, with team-mate Rosberg taking to the wheel on the opening and third days.

The new season starts in March in Melbourne, with Hamilton bidding to win his third title.
