A Florida woman left her 19-month-old daughter inside a car while she went shopping on Monday.

Vita Abramenkova, 35, was shopping inside a Pinellas Park Target while her daughter was inside her car, Sgt. Adam Geissenberger said in a release.

Abramenkova was inside the store for 40 minutes and admitted to leaving her daughter in the locked car, he said.

Geissenberger said the car was left on with the air conditioning on a low setting - while the temperature in the parking lot was 92 degrees. The toddler was found crying inside Abramenkova's car.

Abramenkova told police she didn't want to wake up her sleeping daughter, Geissenberger said.Â 

A parademic who was not working at the time reported the child to authorities, he said.

Abramenkova was charged with child neglect. She was released on $2,000 bond. Pinellas County jail records did not show whether she had an attorney.
