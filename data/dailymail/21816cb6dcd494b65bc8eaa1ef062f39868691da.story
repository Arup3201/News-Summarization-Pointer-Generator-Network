A judge has insisted that ‘this knife business must end’ as he jailed three men for life for the murder of a bright schoolboy who had ambitions to be a doctor.

Ajmol Alom, 16, had been playing football with some friends in a park in Poplar, east London, last August 12 and were on their way home when the gang wearing hoodies and bandanas attacked them near some shops in Spey Street.

Without saying a word, they knifed Ajmol’s friend, in the face then turned on Ajmol when he intervened.

The attackers used kitchen knives and a machete-like blade to carry out the assaults.

Aminur Nadir Khan, 20, Mashudur Rahman, 22, and Ali Akbar Choudhury, 20, were told by Judge Martyn Zeidman, QC at Snaresbrook Crown Court that they will serve a minimum of 23 years.

Ajmol, described as one of the brightest pupils at nearby Langdon Park School, was just days away from receiving his GCSE results and it later emerged that he had achieved top marks including eight A and three B grades.

Judge Zeidman said the gang’s actions had ‘imposed upon the Alom family a life sentence of sadness and mourning’ adding that the attack on Ajmol and his friend, who was stabbed in the face with a 10in knife but has since made a good recovery, were ‘totally unprovoked’.

His Honour Judge Martyn Zeidman QC has issued a call for an end to 'knife madness'

In the year ending in March 2013, 400 people died as a result of knife crime and the judge said: ‘This knife madness must end. There has to be a change. But cold figures can never sufficiently reflect the tragic sorrow caused by knife crime.

‘In our case there were two totally unprovoked attacks upon 16-year-old boys.

‘The first stabbing was to [Ajmol friend]'s face but that did not quench your joint thirst for violence.

‘Within a minute or so you were each a party to the second attack, this time upon Ajmol Alom. You each played a part in bringing his life to an end.’

Scene of the crime: Spey Street in Poplar, east London, where Ajmol Alom was murdered last summer

Judge Zeidman said that he could not say for sure which defendant stabbed each victim but it was clear it was a ‘joint enterprise’ between them.

‘I am sure that this was a planned premeditated group attack, carried out in revenge upon a random selection of targets who were entirely innocent of any wrongdoing and who had not in any way provoked the attack,’ he said.

The judge 
told the defendants that Rohima Khatum, Ajmol’s mother, said in a victim
 impact statement that her son’s death ‘has left a massive hole in my 
life which can never be filled.

‘There
 is no laughter in our home anymore. I have no interest in planning for
 the future and I find it hard to enjoy anything,’ she said. ‘I feel 
like my heart has been taken away.’

All three defendants had previous convictions for violence, the court heard.

Rahman received a three-year sentence in a young offenders’ institution for stabbing someone in the face with a seven-inch knife, while Choudhary did not have any knife crime on his record but has 15 previous convictions, including an unprovoked group attack on a man in a street.

Khan, who was taken into care at the age of 15, has four offences of assault or battery on his record, including a robbery in which he threatened a man on a bus with a knife, the court was told.

After the men were led down from the dock, Judge Zeidman offered his condolences to Ajmol’s family in the public gallery and said it was clear the teenager was an ‘exceptional person’.

‘Some have emphasised his intellectual qualities. He did brilliantly in his GCSEs and there was talk of him becoming a doctor,’ the judge said.

‘Those are useful gifts but his star quality was not his brain but his heart. He was an extraordinarily kind person, gentle and sensitive.’
