'Time poor' middle class Britons are abandoning their weekly shop in favour of buying 'little and often' from convenience stores, a study has found

Middle class Britons are abandoning their weekly shop in favour of buying 'little and often' from convenience stores in a bid to save money, a survey has revealed.

Families who are short on time are grocery shopping at least twice as often as they were five years ago as they look to reduce food wastage.

The change in shopping habits has already resulted in a 20 per cent drop in the amount of food thrown out over the past seven years, according to research carried out by Waitrose.

It has also seen shoppers select ingredients specifically for one or two meals while spending is up in convenience stores with a quarter of consumers visiting one every day.

Waitrose managing director Mark Price said: 'The twin pillars of convenience and technology mean that people shop more often, and in ways that suit them.

'We have seen that Britain has become a lot thriftier, probably for the better. 

'Shoppers have refused to let go of the shopping habits they adopted during the recession.' 

Shoppers who are 'time poor' are increasingly turning to pre-prepared food  with sales of Mexican meal kits up a fifth, Thai meal kits up 15 per cent and on-the-go breakfast products up ten per cent on last year.

The convenience factor has stretched as far as preparing a drink, with the retailer's sales of ready-to-drink alcohol such as gin and tonic in a can up 40 per cent on last year. 

The supermarket says it has responded to the change in shopping habits with plans to have opened 21 Little Waitrose convenience stores across the UK by the end of the year, including eight in London.

Mr Price added: 'We are fast becoming a nation of foodies. Increasing numbers of people have moved from seeing eating as functional to seeing it as an experience to be relished and enjoyed.

'Today, more than ever before, people see food and cooking as a hobby. All these factors feed into how we eat in 2014.'

At breakfast time, people are increasingly choosing honey over jam while consumers developed a taste for Austrian wine (up 25 per cent), premium tequila (up 100 per cent) and alcoholic ice tea.

Food trends saw sales of flower sprouts - a cross between Brussels sprouts and kale - take off, while venison and bone marrow both increased in popularity, till figures show.

Consumers are now four times as likely to buy a katsu curry kit as they are tikka masala, the report reveals.

Sales of Tunnock's tea cakes increased by 62 per cent after they featured in the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony, and sales of South American wines were up 50 per cent during the World Cup in Brazil.

Looking ahead to next year, the supermarket has predicted consumers will continue to move on from drinking tequila slammers to 'savouring and appreciating' the spirit, and will branch out to try Japanese whisky.

It is also tipping Peruvian food as a new trend, while snacks and drinks will go 'upmarket' in the form of new ready-to-drink cocktails with premium ingredients and doughnuts with alternative shapes and fillings.

And seventies dinner party classics such as beef bourguignon will reappear but with lighter ingredients such as vegetable stock.

A survey found four in 10 people now say that the weekend has become more of an 'event' in terms of what they eat, while a fifth of households are cooking for friends at weekends more often than they were a year ago.
