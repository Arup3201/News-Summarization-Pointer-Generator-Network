Britain’s towns and cities are in danger of becoming 'bland, homogenous metropolises' like new cities in China and India by the year 2029, a leading planning expert has said.

Expert David Twohig said historic areas of the UK's largest towns - including London, Bristol and Manchester - could be overrun with 'identikit' shopping centres, office towers and 'analogous housing estates' within 15 years.

Medieval architecture and iconic landmarks are at risk of being 'ensnared' by tasteless architecture as uninspired, cost-cutting developers resort to 'one-stop' solutions to the built towns, he added.

Mr Twohig, head of design at the
 Battersea Power Station Development Company, said parts of the UK will soon resemble the newly-built cities of China and India unless urgent steps were taken to avoid a 'collision course with mediocrity.'

Writing in his new book, Living in Wonderland: Urban Development and Placemaking, he said: 'Over the next 15 years China is set to urbanise 300 million people and build the equivalent urban area of North America.

'London alone is set to grow by two million people by 2030. This is the greatest period of urbanisation in human history and yet the buildings and places we are designing and developing leave a great deal to be desired.'

According to the World Health Organisation, the world’s urban population is set to rise to 6.4billion by 2050. This will create unprecedented demand for housing in cities in both the UK and internationally.

Mr Twohig warns that such high levels of 
urban growth may encourage designers and developers to opt for cheaper 
'lowest-common-denominator solutions'.

Housing, offices and shops 'from Dubai to Shanghai to London' are already 'becoming identical', the planning expert says.

At the current rate of growth, 'soulless architecture' will transform 
the look and feel of Britain’s cities by the end of the late 2020s, he 
added.

Mr Twohig argues the 'clone crisis' has the potential of affecting people’s health, wellbeing and general happiness.

He says: 'The prospect of hundreds of millions of people ending up in nondescript developments without a sense of identity will lead to future social problems: alienation, isolation, crime and more.

'It will also have economic repercussions. Local businesses are vital for injecting money into a community and attracting visitors, while bland developments will rapidly depreciate in resale value and discourage future investment.

'We are all moving in the direction of a default life; a sort of Zara- wearing model, living in a glass tower, eating Whole Foods, drinking in Starbucks and watching our local version of the X-Factor.

'There is already concern with the rise of so-called ‘clone towns’ in the UK, but the problem is far bigger than this. We are heading towards a clone world. When did life become so generic?'

The book echos Prince Charles now infamous 'carbuncle' speech - delivered at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the setting Hampton Court Palace almost thirty years ago.

The prince had been invited to present the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture to the Indian architect Charles Correa when he said: 'What is proposed is like a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend.'

Charles was speaking about the then proposed extension of the National Gallery designed by Ahrends Burton Koralek. The carbuncle was never built following the speech.

Mr Twohig spent two years researching his book by visiting some of the world’s most successful developments and by identifying 'dismal cities' and many 'dramatic, large-scale mistakes'.

He argues that quality, uplifting architecture needn’t be expensive and that it would create new districts that residents would be proud of for future generations.

He says: 'I am not condemning this form of architecture, for which there is an obvious demand, but rather encouraging more considered thinking in an attempt to fuse money-driven design with an engaging and culturally led public realm.

'My hope is that anyone interested in creating the world of tomorrow will be better equipped to make outstandingly liveable cities.'
