The father of the three young girls who perished in a horrific fire at their mother's Connecticut mansion on Christmas Day has filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife's boyfriend over the deadly blaze.

Matthew Badger formally served a wrongful death and negligence lawsuit on Wednesday against Michael Borcina, the contractor boyfriend of Madonna Badger, who also lost her parents in the fire.

In the papers, filed in Stamford, the bereaved father claims the house had become a 'firetrap' due to 'substandard construction'. Borcina had been the contractor for the $1.7 million home.

'No smoke detectors or fire alarms 
alerted them to the fire,' the lawsuit claims.

'The girls died before they could escape the home, which 
had become a firetrap as a result of months of substandard construction 
leading up to the fire.'

Borcina was supposed to oversee the installation of a
smoke detector system after beginning renovations at the 
three-story home in 2011, the suit claims, the Stamford Advocate reported.

In an interview since the tragedy, Madonna Badger
told the Today show that she had thought the home had fire alarms - but
awoke in the early hours of Christmas Day to smoke and silence.

Victims: The deadly fire on Christmas Day killed nine-year-old Lily and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah

Devastation: The lawsuit claims that Borcina failed to oversee the implementation of fire alarms at the Connecticut mansion, and that he did not have the correct work permits

The lawsuit adds that Borcina failed to complete the renovations by April 2011, as planned, as he ignored 
standard contracting practices.

'The complaint speaks for itself,' Mr Badger's lawyer, Richard Emery, told the Advocate. 'We're moving forward on this, and we're going to go aggressively.'

Emery previously told the New York Post: 'Borcina was the contractor on the job. He was aware 
of the dangers, or should have been aware of dangers, that a civilian 
would have been unaware of.

'The fact that kids
were living in this house was unbelievable. I don’t hold Madonna 
Badger responsible for that at all because I can’t imagine she would 
have understood the immediacy of the dangers.'

Victims:

Johnson died trying to save their grandchildren, left. Another grandchild Morgan (right) was not in the 
house

The suit also names the city of Stamford and the home's architect, electrician and general contractor as defendants.

It claims that city officials should 
have known the contractors did not have the correct work permits and 
that Borcina did not have a home improvement contractor's license for 
the state.

Borcina and Mrs Badger were the only 
survivors of the blaze that claimed her nine-year-old daughter Lily and 
seven-year-old twins, Sarah and Grace. Her parents, Pauline and Lomer 
Johnson, also died.

The deadly blaze started after 
Borcina placed ashes from the fireplace in a paper bag in a plastic 
container in a mudroom of the house. Within hours, smouldering embers 
ignited.

The girls and their grandmother died 
from smoke inhalation, while Lomer Johnson suffered a fatal a head injury when 
he fell from a second-floor window onto the home's roof.

Dispute: Officials ruled that smouldering embers taken from the fireplace had started the fire. But Mrs Badger, left, said Borcina, right, had checked to see if they were still hot

Last month, prosecutors decided that 
criminal charges will not be filed in the tragedy, as some precautions 
were taken at the time and although they proved insufficient, they 
could not be considered criminal negligence.

Mrs Badger has argued against the 
official account of the fire, saying that she saw her boyfriend run his 
fingers through the ashes to check they were not alight.

As she went to bed in the early hours of Christmas Day, the box of ashes caught her eye, she told the Today Show.

He then placed them on top of a plastic bin in a mudroom, which caught 
her eye as she walked up the stairs in the early hours of Christmas 
morning.

'I remember thinking to myself, "I should put that outside. I should put
that outside",' Mrs Badger said. 'Then I remembered 
thinking, "No, but I watched him put his hands through it".'

Remembered: Hundreds gathered for the funeral held at St. Thomas Church in New York City on 
January 5

Matthew Badger, who said he still 
cries daily over his daughters' lost lives, has sought to come to terms 
with their deaths by creating something positive in their memories.

He has set up the Lily Sarah Grace 
Fund to raise money for teachers in public schools to incorporate art 
into their teaching - a hobby his daughters, who were all dyslexic, 
loved.

'It's really hard,' he told Good 
Morning America. 'People treat their grief in different ways. Either 
they head straight into the wind [or] some people hide behind a rock.

'I had a very hard time making sense 
of what life was. The instinct of a father for me was that I needed to 
love my children and that love I channelled into the creation of the 
Lily Sarah Grace Fund.

'I need to try and make them have made a mark on the planet, and not have just died in vain.'
