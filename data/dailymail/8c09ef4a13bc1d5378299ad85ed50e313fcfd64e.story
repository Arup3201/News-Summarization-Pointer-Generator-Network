The number of people  living to 100 in the UK has increased by 71 per cent in the last ten years, and has shot up more than five-fold since the Eighties.

There are now more than half a million people aged 90 and above living in this country, with nearly 14,000 of them aged more than 100, compared to just 2,500 in 1980. 

There are also 710 people who have lived beyond their 105th birthday, up from 340 ten years ago.

The number of people aged 100 and over has increased by 71 per cent in the last ten years to nearly 14,000, including 710 people aged more than 105

There are also more than 500,000 people aged 90 and above living in the UK, according to new estimates

In 1983, for every 100,000 members of the public there were 322 people aged 90 and over, and by 2013 this had soared to 822 per 100,000 people in the UK. 

The Department for Work and Pensions centenarian team, based in Newcastle, contacts people approaching their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday.

As the number of people reaching the landmark birthday increases, the team has now expanded from a single person to a team of seven.

Team leader Margaret Wilberforce-Eke said: 'We get to speak to some fascinating people with some amazing stories about their lives over the last century.

'We hear about people celebrating their big days with street parties, hot air balloon rides, trips of a lifetime abroad, and even a pool party.

Life expectancy for men born this year is now 78, compared with 82 for women

'Playing a part in their celebrations is really rewarding and we look forward to helping thousands of people have a happy 100th birthday this year.'

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith added: 'It is a privilege to send these cards and help the hundreds of people each year celebrate their special birthday.

'Our ageing society can only be a cause for celebration and our reforms to pensions are ensuring the system can stay strong as the number of people in Britain hitting 100 ‘not out’ increases.' 

Data released by the Office for National Statistics today also showed  life expectancy has increased again, with the gap between the sexes continuing to close.

Men born this year can expect to live to 78, while women will reach 82 on average. That is compared to just 70 for men born between 1980 and 1982, and 76 for women.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: 'Having nearly 14,000 centenarians in the UK is a cause for real celebration, and while an ageing population does present some new challenges, it is something to be embraced, not feared.

'We do need to invest in the services needed to help older people stay fit and well. Our creaking social care system has been chronically underfunded for years and will simply not be able to cope with the level of need that an ageing population will bring unless substantially more money is found.

'There are still huge disparities in healthy life expectancy across the country, meaning that not only are the poorest socio-economic groups dying almost a generation earlier than those living the longest but they also live more years with disability. 

'This just demonstrates that it's not the length of someone's life that creates the need for services but their health and wellbeing in those years, for which we can all make a difference.

'We also need to create age-friendly communities that offer a good quality of life across the generations, by designing environments that are safe and pleasant to live in, with good local facilities and open spaces.

'If we can get this right, it will help to sustain the health, wellbeing and quality of life for everyone, regardless of age.'
