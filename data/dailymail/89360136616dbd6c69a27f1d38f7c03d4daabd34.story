Researchers have revealed further 'concrete hints' of the elusive material called dark matter at an underground laboratory in the US.

Though it is believed to make up a quarter of our universe, dark matter has never been directly observed.

However, US researchers working deep inside a mine in Minnesota using an experiment called  CDMS - which stands for
Cryogenic Dark Matter Search - say they now have promising results.

Dark matter accounts for most of the mass in the Universe.

It surrounds galaxies 
across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light.

It
cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be 
out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we 
can see.

Galaxies, for 
example, could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape without 
the presence of dark matter, researchers say.

The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates.

'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist.

'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.'

The experiment is designed to catch rare interactions 
when dark matter particles 'bump into' the nuclei of atoms in a detector 
that is held at temperatures near that of deep space.

Scientists at the American Physical Society reported a WIMP, or weakly interacting massive particle, signal at a level known as 3-sigma level, 
which indicates a 99.8 percent chance they have found dark matter.

The mysterious substance is believed to hold the 
cosmos together but to date has never been directly observed.

'In high-energy physics, a discovery is only claimed at 5-sigma or 
better,' Texas A&M high-energy physicist 
Rupak Mahapatra said.

'So this is certainly very exciting, but not 
fully convincing by the standards.

'We just need more data to be sure.

'For now, we have to live with this tantalizing hint of one of the 
biggest puzzles of our time.'

Notoriously elusive, WIMPs rarely interact with normal matter and 
therefore are difficult to detect.

Scientists believe they occasionally 
bounce off atomic nuclei, leaving 
behind a small amount of energy capable of being tracked by detectors 
deep underground, particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider 
at CERN and even instruments in space like the Alpha Magnetic 
Spectrometer (AMS) mounted on the International Space Station (ISS).

The CDMS experiment, located a half-mile underground at the Soudan 
mine in northern Minnesota and managed by the United States Department 
of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has been searching 
for dark matter since 2003.

The experiment uses very sophisticated detector technology and 
advanced analysis techniques to enable cryogenically cooled (almost 
absolute zero temperature at -460 degrees F) germanium and silicon 
targets to search for the rare recoil of dark matter particles.

In the field of particle physics, there is a scale range which is used to determine whether or not a discovery has been made: The five-sigma level of certainty.

The level relates to the probability that an experiment's results are down to chance. In other words, how likely it is that the scientists were correct, rather than just lucky.

1-sigma means a 68.3 percent likelihood the results are genuine.

2-sigma means 99.449 percent, 3-sigma means 99.73 percent, 4-sigma 99.993 percent, 5-sigma 99.999 percent.

At 5-sigma, findings are accepted as discoveries.

However, researchers admit they have more work to do.

'We are only 99.8 percent sure, and we want to be 99.9999 percent sure,' 
Mahapatra said.

'At 3-sigma, you have a hint of something. At 4-sigma, 
you have evidence. At 5-sigma, you have a discovery.

'In medicine, you can say you are curing 99.8 percent of the cases, and 
that's OK.

'When you say you've made a fundamental discovery in 
high-energy physics, you can't be wrong.

'Given the money involved -- $30
million in this case -- it has to be extremely precise.

'With a 99.8 
percent chance, that means if you repeated the same experiment a few 
hundred times, there is one chance it can go wrong.

'We want one out of a
million instead.'

The AMS - a kind of particle accelerator and nicknamed the 'space LHC' in reference to the Large Hadron Collider here on Earth. The first results from the instrument on the International Space Station have found a 'glimpse' of what could be dark matter

Researchers say the different experiments being carried out around the world - and on the International Space Station - are slowly revealing more about dark matter.

'We're actually in a good situation in the whole of the field,' said Bernard Sadoulet of the University of California Berkeley, referring to the four types of experiments being used around the world - and within it and below it - to finally track dark matter down.

'These four ways… we can rely on to help us work through these hints,' he told the meeting.

The new 'recipe for the universe': Planck's high-precision cosmic microwave background map has allowed scientists to extract the most refined values yet of the Universe's ingredients.
