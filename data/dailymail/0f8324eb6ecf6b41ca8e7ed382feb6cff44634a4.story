Salford have signed Wigan prop forward Scott Taylor on a season-long loan for 2015.

The 23-year-old former Hull KR player is under contract with the Warriors until the end of next season but the club have a plethora of front-row options with the signings of Taulima Tautai (Wakefield) and Larne Patrick (Huddersfield) and the return of England international Lee Mossop and need to make room on their salary cap.

Taylor, who joined Wigan two years ago and was in their double-winning team of 2013, lost his place in the team for the last six months of the 2014 season and is expected to move to Hull FC ahead of the 2016 season.

Salford coach Iestyn Harris, who knows Taylor well from his role as Wigan assistant coach, said: 'We are delighted to have signed Scott Taylor on loan for 2015. It will be great to be working with him again.

'He has a fantastic temperament and has great potential to go far in the game.

'At 23, he has a wealth of Super League experience, including Challenge Cup and Grand Final appearances, so he brings a lot to the team.

'When I first heard that I had another opportunity to work with Scott I was overjoyed and I think he'll be the final piece of the jigsaw for our 2015 season.'
