As a former KGB chief, Vladimir Putin is used to dealing with defectors.

Maybe that’s why he was so happy to greet French tax rebel Gerard Depardieu yesterday after granting him Russian citizenship.

The actor, 64, has been accused of betrayal after quitting his homeland to avoid a new 75 per cent tax rate for millionaires.

Warm welcome: Depardieu was offered citizenship and a passport by the Russian President

Putin said last month that Depardieu 
would be welcome in Russia, which has a flat income tax rate of 13 
percent, compared to the tax on income over 1 million euros 
($1.3million) that Hollande wants to levy in France.

He also offered Depardieu a Russian passport,
saying he had a close, special relationship with France and had 
developed warm ties with the actor, even though they had rarely met.

The Russian president and Depardieu were
shown on state-run Channel One shaking hands and hugging each other 
early as they met at Putin's residence in the Black Sea town of Sochi, during what the Kremlin said was a private visit by the 
actor to Russia.

'A brief meeting between the president 
and Depardieu took place,' said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. “On the
occasion of his visit to Russia, he was handed a Russian passport.”

Peskov did not say whether Putin personally gave Depardieu the passport or if he picked it up through standard procedures. He said the actor also told Putin about his career plans.

Depardieu, who has made more than 150 films including Cyrano de Bergerac and Green Card, which is about a man who enters into a marriage of convenience to get US residency, is a popular figure in Russia.

The 64-year-old actor has appeared in many advertising campaigns, including for Sovietsky Bank's credit card and is 
prominently featured on the bank's home page.

He also worked in Russia in 2011 on a film about the eccentric monk Grigory Rasputin.

Putin asked Depardieu whether he was pleased with his work in the movie, with the French actor saying he had already sent Putin some excerpts from it.

Table talk: The actor has decided to leave his native France over a proposed tax hike for millionaires

The actor's decision to quit France follows his revelation that last year he paid taxes amounting to 85 per cent of his income.

In an open letter 
published in mid-December, Depardieu said he had been 'insulted' by France's prime 
minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and planned to turn over his passport and 
French social security card.

Ayrault called him pathetic for wanting to leave France, initially for tax-friendly Belgium, to avoid the new top rate.

In an angry letter, published in Le 
Journal du Dimanche newspaper, Depardieu wrote: 'I was born in 1948. I 
started working aged 14, as a printer, as a warehouseman, then as an 
actor, and I’ve always paid my taxes.'

Over 45 years, Depardieu said, he had
paid €145million euros in tax, and to this day employs 80 people. Last 
year he paid taxes amounting to 85 per cent of his income.

'I am neither worthy of pity nor admirable, but I shall not be called 'pathetic', he concluded.

'I'm a true European, a citizen of the world.'

Widespread fame: The French actor is a popular figure in Russia

The tax on millionaires was struck 
down by France's highest court on December 29, but the government 
intends to resubmit the law in a slightly different form soon.

Depardieu's decision to quit France has prompted accusations of national betrayal, but some have backed the actor's move.

Sixties sex symbol Brigitte Bardot, 78, said the actor had been the 'victim of extremely unfair prosecution'.

The animal rights campaigner has also now threatened to leave France and move to Russia amid plans to put down two elephants after they contracted tuberculosis at a Lyon zoo.

Meanwhile in Russia, critics of Putin said the granting of a passport to Depardieu was a stunt and pointed out the president announced a campaign only last month to prevent rich Russians from keeping their money offshore.
