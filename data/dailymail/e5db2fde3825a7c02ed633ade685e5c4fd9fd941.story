No damage has been found on a Shell oil drilling ship that lost its mooring and drifted into an Alaska harbour on Saturday, the Coast Guard has said.

Video captured by divers who examined the hull of the  571ft-long rig Noble Discoverer shows no signs of grounding, it is claimed.

The ship slipped its anchorage on Saturday in winds up to 35mph, drifting extremely close to shore in Dutch Harbor.

Just how close is still a subject of hot debate - one local captain disputed initial reports that said the Discoverer came within 100 years of shore.

Kristjan Laxfoss took photos that he claims show the vessel came much closer to land and prove it was not moving and grounded.

He said: 'There's no question it hit the beach. That ship was not coming any closer. It was on the beach.'

But Coast Guard investigators say otherwise.

Lt Jim Fothergill said: 'We are still reviewing the video. However, what I can tell you is that there is no physical evidence that suggests that they hit bottom.

'We believe if they did ground, it was a very soft grounding.'

Earlier footage taken by a remotely operated vehicle also shows no damage, he said. There have also been no reports of injury or pollution.

The Discoverer, owned by Noble Corp, is among a Shell fleet to soon head north for planned exploratory drilling in the Arctic waters of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.

The ship is now anchored 750yards from land after it was towed offshore following the mishap.

Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said about 120 crew members were on board when the Discoverer dragged anchor.

They remain on board gearing up to begin the journey to the Arctic in late July.

Mr Smith said the trip will take four or five days, and the company aims to begin drilling in early August.

Drilling in Arctic waters is bitterly opposed by environmental groups and some Alaska residents.

Their
 lawsuits and permit appeals have prevented Shell from drilling in the 
Chukchi Sea, where the subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell spent $2.1billion
 on leases in 2008. Shell also holds older leases in the Beaufort Sea 
and hopes to drill exploratory wells this summer in both locations.

Environmentalists
 say the anchorage problem is yet another reason to question Shell's 
Arctic plan, particularly after the same vessel ran into a mooring 
problem in a severe storm in New Zealand waters last year.

The Discoverer had been drilling an exploratory well off the South Taranaki coast.Â 

New
 Zealand officials say three of eight anchor cables broke after the crew
 had already disconnected from the oil well when alerted to bad weather 
approaching.

Soon after the
 incident, Shell officials said there were no injuries or harm to the 
environment or the well, and that the vessel sustained minor damage and 
was repaired.

The incident was investigated by New Zealand officials, who said no further action was warranted.

Mr
 Smith said Shell has been excited about the Arctic project for a long 
time, but that the Discoverer incident temporarily damped that 
excitement.

He said: 'Anytime something like this happens operationally, you have to take it extremely seriously.

'Our goal is always flawless execution, and when that doesn't happen - either in port or offshore - it's unacceptable.'
