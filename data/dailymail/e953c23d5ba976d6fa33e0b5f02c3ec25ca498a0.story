Does my bum look big in this? Does this colour suit me? No need to trust your man or best mate to answer those questions - you can now access honest answers from 50,000 other fashion lovers

So instead of asking your man or best mate for outfit advice on a Saturday night, you can upload a couple of options on the app and in no time you'll see what percentage of your 'fashion advisers' like which outfit.

The app was first created in France but launched in the UK in October and has also rolled out in 60 other countries. It now has 50,000 users worldwide, 4,000 of which are in the UK.

Founder and CEO Gerard Sillam says the concept builds on Mark Zuckerberg's vision of the 'collective intelligence'.

'We have decided to accomplish right now what Mark Zuckerberg has described as the future of the social networks in the next 5 to 10 years - a direct access to the collective intelligence which enables the users to take decisions,' he explains.

Users create their own profile, and invite friends and other app users to become their advisers and sign one to advise others.

So if you fancy yourself as an amateur stylist, it's the perfect forum to air your fashion views. As well as voting, you can also add comments to fellow users dilemmas.

Users choose who they want to be their advisers according to country or credentials and the app also makes recommendations.

In France, for example, Okay have selected 20 top fashion bloggers and influencers and will steer users in their direction. 

You can also categorise your advisers into different sections. If you are going to LA for the weekend and want to check your wardrobe is on trend, for example, you can select advisers only from LA.

Actress Diane Kruger is fan of the app, as is Made In Chelsea's Lucy Watson and The Hill's Stephanie Pratt.

So whether it's an outfit for a big night out or a job interview you've been mulling over, you need no longer rely on your boyfriend, best friend or mum. Tens of thousands of  fashion lovers are waiting to give you their honest opinion.
