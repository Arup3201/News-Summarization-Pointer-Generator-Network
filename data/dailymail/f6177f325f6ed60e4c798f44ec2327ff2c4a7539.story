A Missouri boy's heart started beating after his mother prayed aloud to God in a hospital room, she says.

John Smith fell through ice on top of a lake and stayed under for 15 minutes, KDSK reported.

Two of his friends also made the fall, with the NBC affiliate reporting 'When rescuers arrived, one was almost out of the water, another was holding onto the ice and one couldn't be found.'

The 14-year-old was reportedly taken to SSM St. Joseph Hospital West on Martin Luther King Day, when the trio's drop into the waters of Lake Sainte Louise occurred.

Survival: John Smith, seen in an interview with The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, is getting better. Last month he reportedly fell through ice and was under water for 15 minutes. Though doctors feared Smith dead, his pulse started beating after his mother prayed aloud

The teenager was unresponsive to 27 minutes of CPR at the hospital, according to KDSK.

Dr. Kent Sutterer said in an interview with the television station 'Everybody says "Well the cold helped him." Well, he was dead for 45 minutes.'

KDSK reported the boy's mother, Joyce Smith, was asked to enter the room by Sutterer so he could tell her it wasn't looking good.

Sutterer said that 'John's mom [Joyce Smith] came in and she started praying loudly.'

'Within a matter of a minute or two, his heart started again,' the doctor said.

Joyce Smith told KDSK 'I don't remember what all I said. But I remember, "Holy God, please send your Holy Spirit to save my son. I want my son, please save him." And they hadn't been getting a pulse at that time, so all of a sudden I heard them start saying, 'We got a pulse, we got a pulse."'

Danger: Smith and two of his friends fell ice over Lake Sainte Louise on Martin Luther King Day 

Smith's son was later transported to SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, KDSK reported. The news outlet reported the teenager's bloodstream had acid in it and his circulatory system was in shock and he soon started to heal.

Dr. Jeremy Garrett said to the television station 'This is a bona fide miracle.'

Garrett said that after signs of improvement, 'I did a very interesting neurologic exam. We said, "Well John, pretend your left hand is Lebron James and your right hand is Michael Jordan," then asked him a series of questions and he got them all right. It's truly amazing.'

John Smith, meanwhile, told the television station 'I'm surprised I'm alive but it's a real miracle that I'm alive, and I thank God I'm alive, and there's a reason I'm alive, so I'm just going to kind of follow what God has in store for me throughout my life.'

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Smith received a combined 43 minutes' worth of CPR from first responders and hospital staff.

The newspaper reported 'He has some scrapes on his arms, legs and neck from the jagged edges of the ice, and his hands are sore, but not sore enough to keep him from texting his friends.' 

According to the Post-Dispatch, Smith will undergo physical therapy and left the hospital on Wednesday.
