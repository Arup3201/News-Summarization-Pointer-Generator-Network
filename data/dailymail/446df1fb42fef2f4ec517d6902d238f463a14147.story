Oliver Gore-Booth, a former public schoolboy, used a pen camera to secretly film women in the shower at his gym and up their skirts on escalators 

An ex-private schoolboy who used a secret pen camera to film up women's skirts on the Tube and spy on them showering is facing jail. 

Oliver Gore-Booth, nephew of the former High Commissioner of India and the great, great grandson of Arctic explorer the 5th Baronet Gore, of Lissadell, used a pen camera to film women showering at a north London gym as well as up their skirts on escalators on the Tube.

He had collected three years of secret videos. 

The 34-year-old HR manager also installed a hidden camera in his bathroom to secretly film women showering. 

He was rumbled when a gym user found the spy camera he had been using at the Anytime Gym in Pentoville Road in Islington. 

Gore-Booth has worked for Sky, Eurostar, Viacom, and moo.com and went to co-educational independent Canford School in Wimborne, Dorset, which charges boarders over £10,000 a term.

He also comes from an influential family. 

His uncle, the late Sir David Gore-Booth, died aged 61 in 2004 after a 34-year diplomatic career as both ambassador to Saudi Arabia and High Commissioner in India.

His great uncle was leading diplomat Lord Paul Gore-Booth, while his great, great grandfather was an Arctic explorer, the 5th Baronet Gore, of Lissadell, co. Sligo.

At a hearing at Blackfriars Crown Court Gore-Booth admitted five counts of voyeurism and four of outraging public decency and was told to prepare for a prison sentence when he is jailed next month.

Lyell Thompson, prosecuting, said: 'A member of the gym found the pen positioned to film persons using a shower cubicle area.

‘Police went to his home and found a laptop with images of what’s been filmed on previous occasions.

‘There are images in a private place such as his bathroom of people using the shower.

‘The other charges are incidents in public where he has been putting a camera pen or similar item up ladies’ skirts as they go up an escalator.’

Gore-Booth went to Canford School in Wimborne, an independent school which charges £10,000 a term

Judge Blacksell freed Gore-Booth on bail on the condition he does not go to the Anytime Gym, but told him: ‘It was over a fair old period of time and I can’t ignore that it’s a camera he set up for these purposes.

‘There is a history of using a camera in order to obtain images that he found gratifying and it’s obviously an affront to those he abuses in this way.

‘This obviously does cross the custody threshold.’

He was told the offences, carried out between 2011 and 2014, fell into the most serious category.  

Gore-Booth, of Wandsworth, admitted five counts of voyeurism and four of outraging public decency.

He is due to be sentenced on February 26.
