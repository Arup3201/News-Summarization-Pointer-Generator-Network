The head of the world's economic watchdog delivered a stunning endorsement of the coalition's record last night - saying Britain was setting an example to the rest of the world.

Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund, said in much of the world growth was 'too low, too fragile'.

But completing an extraordinary volte face on the Government's austerity measures - which as recently as 2013 were being attacked by the IMP as 'playing with fire' - she called on other countries to look to the UK's example.

Miss Lagarde was speaking after talks in Washington with David Cameron and other senior economic figures from around the world.

'The UK is leading in a very eloquent and convincing way in the European Union,' she said.

'A few countries, only a few, are driving growth: one is the USA, where growth is solid, anchored and where we foresee a 2015 that will be also a good year. And the UK where clearly growth is improving, the deficit has been reduced, and where the unemployment is going down.

'Certainly from a global perspective this is exactly the sort of result that we would like to see: more growth, less unemployment, a growth that is more inclusive, that is better shared, and a growth that is also sustainable and more balanced.'

Miss Lagarde's endorsement will be greeted with delight by senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who were angered by previous IMF criticism of their policies.

In 2013, the organisation warned that persevering with strict austerity policies risked denting Britain's economic prospects.

Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the IMF, said George Osborne was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity, insisting: 'In the face of weak demand it is really time to reconsider an adjustment to the fiscal consolidation plans.'

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, also in Washington, said Britain and the US were doing 'better than the Eurozone' but had 'stagnant living standards'.

People would be worse off in real terms by May's general election than they were in 2010, he said.

Mr Balls also insisted that exiting the EU under a re-elected Conservative government which has pledged to hold an in/out referendum was now the biggest risk to Britain's economy.

Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said: 'Britain's place is for the British to decide. But as an American friend of Britain I think it would be a disaster if Britain were to leave Europe. One of the central themes of our report is the importance of collaboration between countries in making the global economy work for everyone.

'Otherwise you're going to have taxes cut rapidly for the very wealthy, who are able to move, which is going to force them to be increased on working people. You're going to see regulatory standards cut in an effort to attract businesses.

'We need systems of cooperation, that enable the global economy to be managed, and that will be much less likely if Britain is on its own and is not part of the EU.' 

Mr Cameron also met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office in Washington last night
