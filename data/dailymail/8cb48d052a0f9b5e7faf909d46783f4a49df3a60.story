A church organist was battered to death with a pickaxe handle by two laughing killers as he walked to midnight mass on Christmas Eve, a court heard yesterday.

Alan Greaves, 68, had his head and face smashed to pieces in the ‘motiveless’ beating and was left for dead on the pavement.

The devoted family man had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time when he bumped into Jonathan Bowling and Ashley Foster – who were out looking for a random target, Sheffield Crown Court was told.

Alan Greaves, a popular church organist, suffered 'unsurvivable' head injuries in the attack

Robert Smith, QC, prosecuting, said: ‘These two men were walking the streets looking for a suitable victim.

‘If it had not been Mr Greaves it would have been someone else.

‘They both intended to inflict really serious bodily harm to Mr Greaves and that was exactly what was done to him.’

The 22-year-olds went out in the High 
Green area of Sheffield armed with a pickaxe handle and a hammer or 
similar weapon after spending hours drinking lager and Bacardi and Coke,
said Mr Smith.

CCTV footage showed them following Mr Greaves closely as
he walked to St Saviour’s Church, where he had played the organ for 
more than 40 years.

The pair then started to run at him before launching an attack at a dimly-lit spot near a park, the court heard.

But the motive was not robbery as their victim’s briefcase was left and his pockets not searched, the jury was told.

Mr Greaves, a grandfather and father 
of four, was found by a delivery driver a short time later with 
‘catastrophic’ head injuries.

He died three days later in hospital.

The suspected killers ran off through the park and Mr Smith told jurors that witnesses heard them ‘laughing together’.

When police later released CCTV 
footage taken of two suspects near the scene, friends and relatives of 
the men – described as ‘virtually brothers’ – recognised them.

Foster 
was ‘faced with no choice’ but to hand himself in at a police station, 
jurors were told.

Following his arrest he blamed Bowling for the killing, telling detectives he only witnessed the crime.

However, Mr Smith said both men ‘were 
in this together’, causing injuries to Mr Greaves similar to those seen 
in road crash victims.

His skull and the bones in his face 
were fractured by ‘prolonged’ blows with two weapons – causing 
‘unsurvivable’ head and brain injuries, said Mr Smith. A pickaxe handle 
allegedly used in the assault was later found by police at an address 
linked to Bowling.

Foster is said to have approached a 
police officer near the scene four days after the killing and said the 
crime was a ‘disgrace’ and he hoped whoever was responsible would get 
‘hammered in prison for beating up an old man’.

Foster, who lived in the same suburb 
of Sheffield as Mr Greaves and his wife Maureen, also allegedly told an 
officer he would ‘grass up’ the killers if he knew who they were.

After the CCTV footage was released, 
he claimed Bowling threatened to ‘torture and kill’ him and his children
if he told the police what had happened, the court heard.

Foster told police in a statement he 
was ‘just a witness’ and Bowling had battered the victim. ‘I didn’t 
anticipate he would suddenly assault a complete stranger,’ he told 
detectives.

The prosecution insist Foster is equally guilty. Mr Smith said Mr Greaves ‘loved music and his life was surrounded by it’.

He played piano at a primary school 
and was involved in a local choir, he said. On Christmas Eve last year 
he followed his usual routine of leaving home on foot to church. But he 
was ‘never to return home’, added Mr Smith.

Bowling has admitted murder, while Foster denies the charge. His trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
