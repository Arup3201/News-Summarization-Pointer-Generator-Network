Rejected: Mr Justice Underhill threw out the Home Office appeal for Bazomba to be deported citing human rights law

An illegal immigrant who was jailed for beating his children cannot be deported because it would breach his right to a family life.

Antonio Alfredo Bazomba, 49, was sentenced to two years in prison for kicking and punching his two sons and a daughter.

But an attempt by the Home Office to have him deported following his sentence has been rejected.

At an immigration tribunal, a judge ruled he could not be sent back to Angola because it would breach Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees a right to family life.

Bazomba entered Britain illegally from Angola in 2001 to try and claim asylum.

His case was rejected but he was given 'exceptional leave to remain' for another three years. His bid to extend his stay was again rejected but he was also charged with three counts of child cruelty and one of actual bodily harm.

He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

The tribunal rejected the Government's attempts to have him deported even though it said he had 'imposed a cruel regime on his children over four or five years'.

The Home Office appealed the decision but their case was thrown out by Mr Justice Underhill.

In his ruling he said: 'The children would slapped, kicked, punched and on at least one occasion hit with a wooden ruler. These were not considered acts of corporal punishment but were the result of a loss of temper and control.'

But despite describing the violence as 'very serious', the judge ruled he should be allowed to stay in the UK because the relationship has since improved.

Excuse: Foreign criminals have frequently used European human rights law to prevent them being deported

The ruling said that Bazomba was a 'changed man' after receiving counselling in jail and then re-established a relationship with his children.

But Tory MP Dominic Raab told The Sun: 'It beggars belief that this thug, jailed for abusing his own children, can claim a right to family life. You couldn't get a more perverse illustration of our warped human rights laws.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'Those who come to the UK must abide by our laws. We will take all necessary steps to deport foreign criminals and have introduced tough new rules to protect the public from those who try to stay here through abuse of the Human Rights Act.'The Immigration Bill will contain provisions to give the full force of legislation to these rules and ensure courts properly reflect Parliament's view that serious criminals should be deported unless there are very exceptional circumstances.'

The right to a family life has repeatedly been used by foreign criminals to avoid deportation from Britain.

Recently an Iraqi drug dealer was allowed to stay after claiming his 'Western' tatoos of naked women would put his life in danger in his home country.

Hesham Mohammed Ali, 36, said people with tattoos in Iraq ‘get stoned or harmed’. Judge Jonathan Perkins described the issue as ‘problematic’.

Judge Perkins said he was was impressed by evidence from Ali’s British 
fiancee, Cy Harwood, 31, who met the criminal in 2005.

The judge ruled that Ali’s deportation
would have a damaging effect on her and would be a breach of the 
couple’s rights. Ali has his fiancee’s name, surrounded by stars, 
tattooed on his hand.

His family life was protected despite 
the fact he never sees two children he fathered in the UK. He had a 
child with an Irish woman and then another son with a woman from 
Liverpool, but has no contact with either child, the Upper Tribunal 
Immigration and Asylum Chamber was told.

Figures released to Parliament show 
that 1,230 offenders have overturned their deportation since 2008, 
including three child rapists, three murderers, 13 rapists and a 
terrorist. More than 85 per cent of them claimed deportation would 
breach their right to a family life.
