Dog may be man's best friend but video of a chocolate lab diving 12-feet below the water proves that dogs may have some underwater pals as well.

Meet Jordy the Chocolate Lab from California who can dive 12-feet-under the Smith River in Hiouchi.

When Jordy's Owner Bryce Lund posted video of his adorable canine swimming to the bottom of the river to YouTube about a week ago it went viral with over 400,000 views.

You rock!: Here's Jordy an impressive 12-feet below the river to attempt grab rocks for his collection 

Great swim: Jordy swims happily to the surface of the water though it does not appear as though he's managed to bring a rock to the surface this time 

Bryce Lund says that Jordy loves collecting rocks and that the best ones are often at the very bottom of the river.

'He taught himself how to dive down deeper and deeper to get rocks. This as deep of water he's ever been in and went straight to the bottom, ' wrote Lund in the description of the original video.

The video begins with Jordy standing at the edge of the river and playfully looking down below, perhaps to spot a rock.

Jordy then makes a splash as he swims down to the bottom of the river to collect his prize. 

When Jordy comes back to the surface of the water he has a smile on his face despite not carrying a rock in his mouth this time. 

Lund takes plenty of adorable footage of his lab on his Instagram blund44.

Some of the videos are from Jordy's perspective made possible by attaching a A-jordy-able@ Go-Pro camera.Those videos are a bit more of a bumpy ride, however,

According to Dogtime.com Labradors are hard-working dogs who have historically been used as a fisherman's helper which may explain Jordy's love of the river. 

They are known for their friendly nature and their ability to haul nets, fetch ropes, and even catch fish from chilly waters.
