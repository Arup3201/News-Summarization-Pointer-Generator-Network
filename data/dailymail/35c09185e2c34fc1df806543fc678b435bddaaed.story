Besiktas are playing their European matches at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium this season while their home ground is being renovated.

Everton will head to Berne in Switzerland to take on  Young Boys while Tottenham face Fiorentina in the last 32.

Liverpool will return to the scene of their miraculous Champions League triumph in 2005

Sevilla, the competition's last ever defending champions as this season's winners will instead qualify for the Champions League, face Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach.

The tie pits together teams who have won the competition, or its predecessor the UEFA Cup, five times between them.

Remarkably, aside from the ties involving Celtic and Liverpool, only one other features teams who have played against each other before - Villarreal and Salzburg, who met in the the 2009-10 group stage with Salzburg winning both games.

Liverpool won their last meeting with Besiktas 8-0 in the 2007-08 Champions League. Current captain Steven Gerrard scored in the game but the other goalscorers - Yossi Benayoun with a hat-trick and Peter Crouch and Ryan Babel netting twice apiece - have long since departed Anfield.

The tie will see striker Demba Ba, whose goal for former club Chelsea after Steven Gerrard's slip last season cost Liverpool the Premier League title, face them once again.  

The first-leg matches will be played on February 19, with the return fixtures seven days later.

Roma, second in Serie A, will face Feyenoord in one of the stand-out ties from the remainder of the draw, while Feyenoord's Eredivisie rivals PSV Eindhoven take on Zenit St Petersburg and Ajax face Legia Warsaw.

Wolfsburg v Sporting Lisbon, Napoli v Trabzonspor and Torino v Athletic Bilbao are also among the higher-profile matches drawn by Dudek and UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino.

Liverpool will go up against Besiktas striker Demba Ba, who took advantage of Steven Gerrard's slip to score the opener in Chelsea's win that proved crucial in the Reds' failure to win last season's Premier League title.

The Senegal international said: 'It's a difficult pairing.

'Liverpool are having some hard times now. They couldn't get the results they desired and things are not going well for them (but) hard games are ahead of us.

'If we can snatch a good result in the first leg, it will be an advantage to be playing the second leg at home.'

Everton club ambassador Ian Snodin confidently targeted overall victory in the competition.

He told Sky Sports News HQ: 'We want to ideally win the tie in the first leg but we know we've got the advantage of being at Goodison in the second leg. But we know it's going to be difficult so the boys have got to go out there and perform.

'Spectators have travelled in their thousands to Lille and to Wolfsburg and the players are enjoying it, but first and foremost you want to win the competition. Everton need some silverware, it's been a long, long time.' 

Feyenoord coach Fred Rutten said: 'This is a tough draw. Roma have a good team and are second in Serie A for a reason - that says all you need to know about the strength of our opponents.

'This match is an attractive one, but the only thing that counts for me is that we will go out to win. We play away first so we have to take care to get a good result there.'

Ajax counterpart Frank de Boer was pleased to see his side paired with their Polish opponents.

'My first reaction is that the draw could have been much worse,' he said. 'That does not mean I underestimate Legia Warsaw, but just look at the other strong teams we could have drawn, like Dynamo Moscow, Zenit or Napoli.'
