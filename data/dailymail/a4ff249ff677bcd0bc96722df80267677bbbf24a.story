Meth addiction: Valley Park Mayor Nathan Grellner is also under fire for his expenses

A town mayor has been exposed as a meth addict after he skipped public meetings for five months.

Nathan Grellner, the leader of Valley Park Missouri, claimed he had exhaustion when he checked himself into hospital for three days last month.

But St Louis Today today revealed that he had been treated for methamphetamine abuse and referred to a chemical dependency unit.

The revelation comes after Grellner was earlier arrested for driving while intoxicated but escaped from hospital after he was left unguarded.

It also follows a string of suspicious behaviour by Grellner, who used his city credit card to spend thousands of dollars at strip clubs when he was supposed to be attending meetings and on power tools to renovate his home.

Grellner said he confused the city credit card because he was 'not in a state mind' where could distinguish between the two.

He spent $575 on a Bosch shop vaccum, $2,500 on a washer and dryer, and also bought a miter saw and a hammer drill.

The mayor also spent moe than $2,000 in restaurants and bars including $2.39 on a McFlurry at McDonald's and an $80 tab at TJ Wings Family Pub.

The receipts also showed he was at a strip club when he was supposed to be attending town meetings.

His treatment for meth addiction on June 8 came two days after he was arrested by police for driving intoxicated and resisting arrest.

Grellner was taken to a hospital by police who where doctors said they 'weren't sure what all may be in his system,' according to St Louis today. 

But he was left unguarded and escaped before checking into Centerpoint Hospital in Wheldon Springs two days later.

Grellner is already facing a vote of no confidence over his expense claims and his apparent drug use is set to enrage voters.

Alderman A.J. Levinson - who has also been arrested for driving while intoxicated - said voters were asking whether the town was 'paying for [Grellner's] partying.'

Other local politicians were shocked at the drug abuse revelations.

Alderman Laurie Henderson said: 'I'm speechless. I don't know what my reaction is.'
