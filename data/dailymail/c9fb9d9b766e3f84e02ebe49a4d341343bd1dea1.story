A man was left needing hospital treatment after police punched and kneed him, struck him with batons – and set a police dog on him that bit his neck and head.

David Connor Castellani, 20, was charged with aggravated assault after the incident, but is suing Atlantic City police for using excessive force.

The incident occurred on an Atlantic City street in the early hours of June 5 this year.

Violent: One police officer was filmed repeatedly striking Mr Castellani with a baton as his colleagues wrestle with him

Exchanging words: Mr Castellani remonstrated with police shortly before they arrested him in number

Mr Castellani had been ejected from a casino for being under-age and the footage, taken by the casino’s CCTV system, begins with him remonstrating with police officers.

A short while later three officers run up to Mr Castellani just after he shrugs his shoulders, and wrestle him to the ground.

Mr Castellani does not appear to resist arrest, but can be seen clinging on to one of the officers. 

Two more officers quickly join in, with one repeatedly punching Mr Castellani in the back.

One of the policeman can also be seen hitting Mr Castellani on the back and on the legs with his baton as he lays face down on the road.

Seconds later a police dog handler arrives, identified by NBC investigative reporters as Sterling Wheaten. The policemen restraining Mr Castellani step aside and Officer Wheaten’s dog is shown being allowed to bite him repeatedly on the neck and head.

Arrest: Four officers are seen here forcing Mr Castellani to the ground

Bitten: A police dog is then unleashed on Mr Castellani, leaving him with serious head and neck wounds

Mr Castellani was charged with aggravated assault, with the police claiming that he punched an officer and choked the police dog.

Mr Castellani’s father, an attorney who has represented police officers in the past, told NBC: ‘It absolutely horrified me. It’s been a nightmare for us. I’ve never seen anything like this in my life.’

Speaking about the moment the dog unit arrived, he said: ‘Without any assessment of the situation, he releases the dog on to my son’s neck.’ 

Castellani suffered serious wounds to his head and neck as a result of the dog’s bites, with doctors revealing that he may never be the same, according to NBC.

Doctors revealed that he could have been killed by the dog, the father said.

Ernest Jubilee, Atlantic City Police Chief, told NBC: ‘I saw the tape and I saw no reason to suspend or remove the officers from their regular duties.’

The incident is, however, being investigated by the Atlantic City Police internal affairs unit.

NBC discovered that Officer Wheaten had been investigated 15 times over allegations of misconduct, including 12 claims of excessive force or assault. None of the complaints were upheld.
