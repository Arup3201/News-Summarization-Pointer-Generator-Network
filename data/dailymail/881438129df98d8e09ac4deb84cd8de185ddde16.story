Embroiled in a fresh row: David Cameron

David Cameron was embroiled in a fresh row over his local hunt yesterday after the RSPCA launched an unprecedented prosecution for unlawful foxhunting.

The animal charity is already taking action against one member of the Heythrop hunt, which the Prime Minister has ridden with and which is popular with fellow members of the so-called Chipping Norton Set in the Cotswolds.

But now it has laid fresh charges against the hunt and four of its members – provoking accusations that the charity’s actions are ‘politically motivated’.

The four accused of unlawfully hunting a fox with dogs in contravention of the Hunting Act 2004 are Vanessa Lambert, 29, who is a Joint Master of  the hunt, Richard Sumner, 67, Duncan Hume, 32, and 48-year-old Julian Barnfield, a professional huntsman.

The Mail on Sunday revealed last August that Mr Barnfield was already facing two counts of unlawfully hunting a fox. That case is due to be heard by magistrates later this year.

The new charges have shocked the Heythrop’s supporters, who include Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, her racehorse trainer husband Charlie Brooks, and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who has allowed the hunt to ride on his land.

Critics have questioned how the charity can afford such a move – pro-hunt campaigners believe the case could cost up to £1 million in legal fees – at  a time when it is planning to make staff redundant.

Ms Lambert said last night that all four defendants would deny the allegations when the case comes before magistrates in Banbury, Oxfordshire, on June 1.

She said: ‘The rural community is amazed that the RSPCA has the staffing, the money and the time to pursue what is clearly a politically motivated campaign against a hunt which  operates within David Cameron’s community.’

The RSPCA last night confirmed it had laid charges against both the hunt and the four named individuals following a ‘careful examination’ of the evidence.

But a spokeswoman declined to comment on claims that its actions had a political agenda.

She said: ‘While proceedings are active in this matter, we cannot comment further.’

Apart from his personal  connections with the hunt,  which he rode with in 2003,  Mr Cameron could find the legal action politically sensitive. The Coalition has promised to hold a free vote in Parliament on the hunting ban introduced by Labour in 2004.

Since the law came into force in February 2005, there have been only five successful prosecutions involving more than  300 registered hunts in England and Wales, leading to eight individual convictions. Seven other prosecutions have failed and a verdict is due in one further case involving the Crawley and Horsham hunt in Sussex later this month.

According to pro-hunt campaigners, the RSPCA’s decision to step up its offensive suggests that there are internal tensions in the anti-hunting movement.

The League Against Cruel Sports had been taking the lead on prosecutions and the RSPCA appears to have been pressurised by its own ruling council to follow suit, following criticism that it was not adopting a sufficiently firm approach.

RSPCA council members include Dr Richard Ryder, who was director of the Political Animal Lobby which donated £1 million to the Labour Party before the 1997 General Election. The RSPCA is currently consulting on 130 redundancies because of a serious financial shortfall.

A spokesman for the Countryside Alliance said: ‘The RSPCA’s decision to bring such a huge prosecution is a blatant political attack on hunting and an abuse of the court system.

‘It is no accident that the RSPCA, which was a major  part of the campaign to ban hunting, only brings private prosecutions against hunts in the Prime Minister’s constituency. We believe that these allegations, like 99 per cent of those made about hunts, are groundless and we are confident that the prosecution  will fail.’

In a newspaper article in 2003, Mr Cameron recalled a day he spent with the Heythrop hunt. ‘Nothing had prepared me for the sheer terror of a day’s hunting,’ he wrote.

‘I battled in vain to control  my powerful steed and careered through trees and bushes – completely out of control.’
