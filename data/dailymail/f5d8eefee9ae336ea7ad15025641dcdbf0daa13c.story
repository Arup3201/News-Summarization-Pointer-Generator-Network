A woman described as a 'James Bond-style enforcer' before acquitted last year of the murder of a 21-year-old model is now suing the Santa Monica Police Department.

Kelly Soo Park, 48, was found not guilty of murdering Juliana Redding and recently filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday in Los Angeles accusing police of gross misconduct in the investigation that led to the first and second-degree murder charges brought against her.

Ms Park accuses detective Karen Thompson of failing to investigate all leads in the case, intimidating witnesses and even accepting an award for solving the crime 18 months before the trial even began, according to the lawsuit detailed by CNS.

She is seeking damages for the 'extreme mental anguish' she's suffered and the drop-off in business at a restaurant she co-owns as a result of salacious media coverage depicting her as having gotten away with murder, according to the Los Angeles Times.

'Far from acting as an impartial law enforcement officer, defendant Thompson's bias against plaintiff, her resulting commitment to having plaintiff found guilty at trial at all costs... caused defendant Thompson to interfere with plaintiff's presentation of evidence in support of her criminal defense,' the suit claims.

Redding was found strangled to death in her apartment in March 2008, the investigation eventually turned into a cold case before Thompson dug it back up.

Thompson soon matched DNA found on the victim's body to Park, leading officials to charge her with murder.

The detective then was given a Medal of Merit for solving the case - more than a year before it ever saw a jury.

Park's lawsuit also claims Thompson didn't pursue leads in the case leading to Redding's ex-boyfriend John Gilmore - a man with a history of violence who had assaulted Redding and trashed her apartment several times, including the day before she was found dead, according to the suit.

'Despite this information, defendant Thompson persisted on pursuing plaintiff as the sole suspect of the crime,' the filing says.

Further evidence potentially tying Gilmore to the murder was his lack of an alibi around the time she was killed and his treatment of another girlfriend.

According to the lawsuit, Gilmore told police he left a party around 1 a.m., text messages on his phone prove he left at around 10:30 p.m.

Melissa Ayala told investigators the violent man choked her at least three times, and each time made references to making her feel how Redding felt, the suit alleges.

Ayala even agreed to testify to a grand jury about his assaults after he was convicted of domestic violence for the incidents, but Thompson convinced her, as well as two other witnesses, not to testify, said the suit.

Thompson then waged a campaign to destroy the reputation of Park's then-fiance, a former local police chief, according to the suit.

The jury took seven days to reach a verdict after extra questions from the jury including the difference between first and second-degree murder and a lengthier definition of second-degree murder.

Park was accused of working as an enforcer for a Dr Munir Uwaydah, a physician who once dated Miss Redding, a cover girl for Maxim magazine.

During that time, Uwaydah attempted to go into business with Miss Redding's father, Greg, an Arizona pharmacist.

However, Greg Redding began his own 
background check into the doctor and discovered that Uwaydah was lying 
about his age, was married and had a family.

On learning this, Juliana ended their affair and her father also stopped the business venture he planned with Uwaydah.

Greg Redding sent Uwaydah a letter March 10 ending their business relationship - five days before his daughter was killed.

Prosecutors
 said that Uwaydah made six-figure payments to Park and her family 
before the killing and before Park's arrest. They said he had also 
bragged that he had a 'female James Bond' ready to act.

It
 took two years to discover a suspect in the murder and investigators 
linked Park through DNA evidence found on Redding's neck.

However, Park's attorney had questioned the evidence.

'Forensic
 evidence, the DNA evidence, the fingerprint, are not conclusive. DNA 
evidence doesn't tell you when it got there or how it got there,' said 
George Buehler.

The doctor was never charged in the case. He has since moved to Lebanon.

Initial
 reports at the time described a desperate struggle during which Miss 
Redding had managed to dial 911 for help when her killer apparently 
grabbed the phone and hung up

Investigators in the case said 
that Park was linked to the crime by DNA evidence found on 
Redding's neck, however, defense attorney's argued that the real killer 
is Redding's boyfriend at the time of her death, John Gilmore.

Gilmore
 was cleared as a suspect in the immediate aftermath of the murder, 
insisting that he had several people who could offer him an alibi according to CBS News.
