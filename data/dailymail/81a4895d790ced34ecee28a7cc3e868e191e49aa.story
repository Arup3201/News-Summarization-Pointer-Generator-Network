Lisa Harnum, above, died after falling from the 15th floor of an apartment in Sydney, Australia in 2011

This is the stunning girlfriend who fell 15 storeys to her death, moments after being filmed grappling with her 'controlling and abusive' fiancé.

Lisa Harnum was allegedly heard yelling, 'please help me, God help me' as she fought for her life on the balcony of the flat she shared with Simon Gittany in Sydney, Australia, on the night of July 30 2011.

But nobody came. Moments later she was lying dead, her body 150-feet down on the footpath below.

And today it was revealed the 
30-year-old's terrifying last moments were captured on the very pin-hole
 camera Gittany set up to spy on her every 
move.

Gittany, 37, has pleaded not guilty to murdering his Canadian-born fiancée, claiming he was trying to save her from suicide before she fell.

He has been regularly accompanied to his trial by his current girlfriend.

A neighbour, however, claims he saw a topless man 'fist-pumping' on the terrace after something had gone over the edge, 9News reported.

Another witness walking past 
The Hyde apartment block in the heart of the city told police he saw a 
topless man holding what appeared to be black luggage horizontally over 
the balcony before it fell to earth.

'Of course, it was not a piece of 
luggage, it was Miss Harnum wearing black clothing,' Crown prosecutor 
Mark Tedeschi QC said today at Gittany's murder trial.

Gittany was so jealous, Mr Tedeschi claimed, that he had banned her from seeing friends, 
forbade her from taking a job as a hairdresser and even hired a personal
 trainer to come to their home so she wouldn't go to the gym where he 
thought she would be ogled by other men.

Terror: His hand clamped over her mouth to stifle her 'bone-chilling' screams for help, a shirtless Simon Gittany wrestles fiancee Lisa Harnam - minutes before she plunged 15-storeys to her death. The footage was captured on a pin-hole camera that he set up in the flat to spy on her

Describing Gittany as 'controlling and abusive', Tedeschi said he made her become Catholic, do her hair and dress exactly how he told her.

'[He believed] it was her function in life to submit to his will as the male in the relationship,' Mr Tedeschi said.

But his vice-like grip over her life was still not enough, the court heard. Mr Tedeschi told jurors Gittany even set up a network of mini cameras around the apartment to keep tabs on her and secretly read her emails and text messages.

At court: Gittany, 37, denies murdering Canadian-born Miss Harnam on July 30, 2011, claiming he was trying to stop her from jumping

It was because of this forensic campaign of surveillance that he caught wind of her plan to leave him with the help of two friends, the court heard. As a result he allegedly abused one of them over the phone, advising them to stay away.

In the months leading up to her death, the court heard, Miss Harnum had become so fearful of her fiancé's jealous rage that, when she did venture outside, she only ever stared at the ground or into his eyes for fear he might accuse her of looking at other men.

'The deceased's confidence became more and more diminished,' Mr Tedeschi said.

Giving evidence, Miss Harnum's 
mother said told the court: 'She told me he was always very controlling 
and wanted to always know where she was, what she was doing, who she was
 with, what she was wearing.'

She
 said when Miss Harnum plucked up the courage to tell Gittany she was 
leaving him, he threatened to destroy her chances of getting permanent 
Australian residency - a dream she had harboured since moving to the 
country.

Gittany's defence barrister Philip 
Strickland SC said Miss Harnum was a 'conflicted, complicated and 
confused woman' prone to over-reacting when she didn't get her own way.

Mr
 Strickland said Gittany only monitored her text messages via a computer
 programme because she had told him she had a secret that she couldn't 
disclose to him.

'The secret ate into their relationship,' he said

Her fingerprints were not found 
on the glass or metal rail of the balcony onto which he said she climbed
 before she fell.

Reign of fear: In the months leading up to her death, the court heard, Miss Harnam had become so fearful of Gittany's jealous rage that, when she did venture outside, she only ever stared at the ground or into his eyes for fear he might accuse her of looking at other men
