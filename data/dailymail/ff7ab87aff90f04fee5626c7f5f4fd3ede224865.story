A Texas school district is arming its teachers for the new school year.

Argyle Independent School District is placing warning signs outside its four schools saying staff may use 'whatever force is necessary' to protect their students.

The public will not be allowed to know which teachers, or how many, are armed with concealed pistols, but they have had to pass tests and training courses.

Warning: All four schools in Texas' Argyle district will arm its teachers with guns for the new school year

The signs outside the schools read: 'Attention. Please be aware that the staff at Argyle ISD are armed and may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students.'

The plan is coming into action after a vote in January, and follows 'a comprehensive evaluation of District's safety, security and emergency response politics' after 'the unfortunate and tragic situations that occurred in multiple American schools over the last several years,' a release obtained by the New York Daily News states.

Any armed teacher will have to have a handgun licence, as well as pass an interview, psychological exam and a firearms and emergency response training course. 

'I think if a tragedy does occur, lives can be saved by guns being in the right hands, and I think the teachers here might be able to stop something like that and life can be saved,' parent Lacey Fenoglio told CW33.

Aftermath: Hilltop Elementary School, where staff will now carry guns in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy

The four schools in the district where guns will now be in the hands of teachers are Hilltop Elementary, Argyle Intermediate School, Argyle Middle School and Argyle High School. 

Argyle is the latest in a string of districts to arm its teachers or increase security in schools in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012.

Schools in Shamrock and Levelland districts, also in Texas, adopted the policy of handing guns to staff last year.

Harrold Independent School District in north-central Texas voted to take it up after a shooting in Virginia back in 2007.

At least eight states have passed laws allowing schools to arm their teachers since the Sandy Hook  massacre - which left 20 children and six adults dead at the Newtown, Connecticut elementary school.

As well as in Texas, certain employees at schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee are  allowed to carry weapons on school grounds.

In Texas, at least 78 of the 1,024 school districts have decided to use the plan - whereas just one did before Sandy Hook.

Although just seven of these have put it into action to date - by sending their staff to train as 'marshals' - the Wall Street Journal reports. 

Others have opted to instead increase school police presence or rely on the local authorities. 

This news comes as America is still reeling after a nine-year-old girl shot dead her shooting instructor with an Uzi submachine gun when he told her to go 'full auto'.

The incident at Bullets and Burgers shooting range in White Hills, Arizona, left 39-year-old Charles Vacca dead.
