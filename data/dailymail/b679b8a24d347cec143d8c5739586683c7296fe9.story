The planned unveiling of a statue of Margaret Thatcher on the Falkland Islands has sparked a furious new row between Britain and Argentina.

The bronze sculpture of the Prime Minister whose forces freed the islanders after the 1982 invasion will be unveiled in the capital Stanley next month. 

But Argentina's ambassador to London, Alicia Castro, has condemned the statue 'in our Malvinas Islands' as a provocative move, saying: 'What the UK is doing is celebrating war.'

Costing £40,000, it stands 8ft high on a stone plinth and bears a brass plaque with a quote from Baroness Thatcher from April 1982

Her anger was echoed by veterans' leader Mario Volpe in Buenos Aires. He said: 'The statue is not a symbol of democracy. It's her fault so many died.' He said Mrs Thatcher 'could have avoided the war and the deaths'.

The memorial, to be unveiled by her son, Sir Mark Thatcher, at a ceremony on January 10, is seen for the first time in our exclusive photograph.

Costing £40,000, it stands 8ft high on a stone plinth and bears a brass plaque with a quote from Baroness Thatcher on April 3, 1982: 'They are few in number, but they have the right to live in peace, to choose their own way of life and determine their own allegiance.'

The bust is at the end of Thatcher Drive, next to the Liberation Monument, which honours 255 UK servicemen and three Falklands civilians who died in the conflict. 

About 650 Argentine personnel also died. CCTV will provide 24-hour surveillance around the 'Iron Lady' to prevent it being defaced by those who contest UK sovereignty.

Artist Stephen Massam said: 'The bust is not meant as a provocation, it is meant to honour the role Mrs Thatcher played in liberating the islands, which are British to their core. We're delighted to welcome her home.' 

Mr Massam believes the bust will become a tourist attraction, adding: 'She is an integral part of the islands' history and it is entirely appropriate that her image will gaze down on visitors and that she will remain in the Falklands for ever.'

And last night, the Chief Executive of the Falklands Veterans Foundation, Derek 'Smokie' Cole, gave the statue his backing.

Mr Cole, 58, a Royal Navy officer on the assault ship HMS Intrepid in the war, said: 'She was very determined to recover the Falklands. It is not up to the Argentinians to decide whether or not the statue should be unveiled.'

The row is the latest in a recent series of flare-ups between Argentina and Britain. 

Earlier this year, Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear team were forced to flee Argentina. A mob hurled rocks as they filmed the show's Christmas special, shown last night.
