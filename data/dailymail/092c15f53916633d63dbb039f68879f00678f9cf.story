A fishing enthusiast has captured the moment he reeled in a huge 10 foot bronze whaler shark after a two hour stand-off on a beach.

Daring Jack Jacobs described the catch as ‘a fish of a life for me’ on his YouTube channel, where he posted an eight minute snapshot of his battle with the beast.

Before the shark comes into view, the fisherman is seen clinging onto his rod as a crowd gathers around him in anticipation on a beach in South Australia.

Fisherman Jack Jacobs was very proud after he caught this 10ft bronze whaler shark

He spent two hours trying to catch the large beast with his special fishing rod 

After hours of back and forth, the 200kg shark emerges into the shallow water after being ‘caught on a chunk of eagle ray as bait’.

‘It took several long powerful runs and led me up and down the beach,’ Jacobs said.

He had been trying to catch the fish for ‘several years’ and used a custom made shark rod.

In an eight minute version of his two hour challenge, a video shows him pulling the shark out of the water

His friends and spectators helped him to hold the shark still as he measured it 

'It's a whopper' he cried as he realised how large the shark was

After they'd taken its vital statistics they released the shark back into the water

In the video the rod bends under the strain of the huge shark and at one point part of it breaks off.

‘Oh my god that is a whopper,’ he shouts as the shark washes up on the beach.

After tying a rope around its tail, he and a friend frantically dragged it onto the sand where they measured its credentials.

’10 ft 10 f**k yeah,’ he exclaims before dragging the shark back into the water so that it could swim off.

His friend soon ran off once the shark was back in the water but Jack hung around to watch it

He filmed the shark swimming back off into the sea on the South Australian beach
