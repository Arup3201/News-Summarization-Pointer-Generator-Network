It may have been a case of a lucky break, but when a grandmother asked Damien Hirst to sign her autograph book at a snooker match little did she know he would draw a sketch worth thousands.

Now sports fan Sylvia King, 75, is reluctantly selling the autograph book which has been signed by dozens of star players, because of the valuable drawing.

Over the last five years, the silver-haired pensioner has travelled the length and breadth of the country going to games and adding to her collection.

This included an exhibition event last year at the Trafford Centre in Manchester, which the controversial artist attended in support of his friend, snooker player Ronnie O'Sullivan.

The silver-haired pensioner asked Hirst to add his name to the likes of Steve Davis, Willie Thorne and Cliff Thorburn who had previously autographed her book.

She was amazed when he quickly drew a sketch of a shark in Biro, which represented his famous work of art of a tiger shark immersed in formaldehyde.

The keen snooker supporter is now selling the 'Hirst original' and the rest of the Winnie the Pooh-themed autograph book, because it would be too risky to rip the drawing out.

The artwork is set to fetch up to £5,000 at auction. It is said the snooker player signatures, and those of some dart players, add 'about £10 to £15 to the value'.

The grandmother, from Urmston, Lancashire, said she approached Hirst at last year's snooker event.

She said: 'I went to the ladies and while in there I met Coleen Nolan and got her signature.

'I came out and my partner, Howard, said Damien Hirst had just been interviewed on the stage.

'I grabbed my book again and made a bee-line for him. Dennis Taylor was on the stage with him.

'I waited for him to come off and just said to him 'Mr Hirst, is it possible for me to have your autograph?'

'He said 'certainly' and he wrote my name at the top of the page and he signed the bottom and I wondered why he left a gap in the middle and he started to doodle.

'It didn't take very long and I worked out very quickly what it was.

'I have had the book for five years and it is very nearly full.

'I am 75 and my children don't want it. I suppose the money would come in handy, maybe I'll go on a nice holiday.'

The book is being sold by Adam Partridge auctioneers of Macclesfield, Cheshire.

Bill Forest, of Adam Partridge, said: 'We advised the vendor not to rip the Hirst page out and to leave it with the rest of the autographs because they give it some context.

'You can tell that the vendor has innocently come across Damien Hirst while out collecting autographs and has been very lucky.

'Also, she could easily have ripped the whole page the Hirst drawing is on as well.

'There are more than 30 signatures in the book although they don't add much value to it, maybe £10 to £15.'

The 6ins by 5ins drawing has a pre-sale estimate of up to £2,000, but it could easily fetch £5,000.

The sale takes place on March 7.
