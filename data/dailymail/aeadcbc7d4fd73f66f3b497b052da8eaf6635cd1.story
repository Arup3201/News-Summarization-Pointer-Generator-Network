The naming and shaming of bankers in the wake of the financial crisis is ‘lynch mobbish’, the Archbishop of Canterbury warned last night.

The Right Reverend Justin Welby said it is wrong that individual bankers have been singled out by the media since the financial began nearly six years ago.

Interviewed by Radio 4’s The Bishop and The Bankers, broadcast last night, he said: ‘This business of somehow saying that one individual bears the whole blame as opposed to simply the accountability - it feels lynch mobbish.’

But the former senior oil executive admitted he too might have been sucked into behaving badly in the run-up to the financial crisis, just like the disgraced bankers.

Dr Welby, who sat on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said he had listened to the evidence from bankers - and worried he could have been caught up.

He told the BBC he was ‘sitting there, most of the time, thinking: ‘Well, I’m not sure I would have been any different’, rather than thinking how bad they were.’

Dr Welby discussed how the culture of a company influences its workers, either for good or for bad.

He compared a worker to ‘a bit of plasticine’ which is easily moulded by his or her colleagues.

Johnny Cameron, a former executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, is one of the few bankers to have been disciplined about his role.

He said: ‘What I do remember [from his time in the oil industry] is the sense that the culture and values of the financial world sort of enveloped you and began to shape one, like a bit of plasticine really, into a new ethical shape.

‘You were aware that you were struggling with this and weren’t quite confident - in fact, often rather frightened - by the re-shaping that was going on.’

Dr Welby described the church as ‘the mould that was shaping me correctly.’ 

He worked in the oil industry for 11 years, both in Britain and overseas, but retired his executive position in 1989 after sensing a calling from God.

Dr Welby said he had ‘loved’ his oil industry career, describing it as ‘hugely addictive’ and ‘such a buzz.’

Quizzed by the Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Reverend James Jones, who presented the three-part series, Mr Cameron said the idea that all bankers are bad is wrong.

He singled out scandals such as the mis-selling of payment protection insurance and the manipulation of Libor as utterly reprehensible.

But he added: ‘The whole thing [banking industry] is branded as lacking morality and unethical but it is more complicated, I would say.’ 

In a plea for peace in May, David Cameron called time on the national sport of criticising the financial community and the City of London.

Speaking to business leaders at the Global Investment Conference in London, he said: ‘I think it is clear that this is an industry where we have a massive, international global advantage.

‘We should be proud about that. We should speak up for that.

‘That means we should not spend our time in politics endlessly bashing the banks and financial institutions.

‘If we want the economy to recover, the economy to grow, you have to play to your strengths.’
