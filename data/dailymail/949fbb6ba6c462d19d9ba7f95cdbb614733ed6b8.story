Fashion die-hards rejoice. Olivia Palmero's new capsule collection for luxury Italian shoe designer Aquazzura has finally been unveiled for all to see.

The six-piece collection will launch on Net-A-Porter August 25 - priced between $600 and $1,625 - and includes over the knee suede boots, statement jewel sandals, metallic leather sandals, laced-up gladiator sandals, suede pumps and booties.

'I think it is no secret that I love a good shoe,' said the 28-year-old global style icon. 'So I very much enjoyed creating a "survival pack" for every occasion and women of all ages.'

Ms Palermo, who tied the knot with dishy model Johannes Huebl, also 28, on June 29, has long been a fan of the Florence-based label's elaborate footwear; described by its co-founder and creative director Edgardo Osorio in the past as being an 'unofficial ambassador' for the brand.

'Olivia and I have a very similar vision of shoes,' Mr Osorio states. 'She is a real style icon and has amazing knowledge about shoes and accessories.

'We wanted to create a capsule collection of the styles every woman needs in her closet, interpreted with the Aquazzura aesthetic and seen through the eyes of Olivia.'

The collection of very high heels, modeled by the former reality star herself, includes a pair of jewel-encrusted stilettos inspired by a vintage Victorian necklace she owns.

Saks Fifth Avenue will stock the fall collection from September, as will Lane Crawford, Tsum and Holt Renfrew; while Net-A-Porter will be the only online retailer to sell them.

It's not the newlywed socialite's first foray into the arena of designer collaborations. In 2010, she launched a jewelry line with Roberta Freymann, and the following year, she was invited by Stuart Weitzman to design a shoe for charity.

Last month, she designed a capsule collection of sunglasses for Westward Leaning, retailing for $210 a pair.

'No other person... has the kind of conversion power that Olivia has,' Westward Leaning's co-founder Robert Denning said in June. 'When Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez broke up, he left wearing the pair of sunglasses we’d gifted Selena.

'I thought it would lead to a huge spike in sales, but didn’t move the dial at all.'

If her apparent Midas touch with Westward Leaning's wares is anything to go by, Ms Palmero's Aquazzura collaboration is likely to be a storming success.
