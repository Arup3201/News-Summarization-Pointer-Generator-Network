Great Briton: Joseph Stenhouse, who died in action in 1941, was at the forefront of British exploration of the Antarctic and later fought valiantly against the Germans in both wars

He was one of Shackleton's key men during his Antarctic adventures and went on to be a decorated hero in both World Wars.

But at last the incredible life of great British sailor Joseph Stenhouse has been brought to the fore with the sale of his vast collection of medals.

The impressive artefacts, which includes his OBE and Distinguished Service Order, are now being sold at auction in London and are expected to fetch £25,000.

They have spent the last 30 years in the private collection of an unidentified ‘connoisseur’ of British naval history.

Stenhouse catapulted himself from his life as a shipbuilder's son in Dumbarton, Scotland, to one of the last century's most impressive men, helping lead British exploration and later protecting our shores from German attack.

His qualities were first recognised when he joined Ernest Shackleton’s legendary expedition to the Antarctic in 1914 where he commanded the supply ship Aurora which spent 283 days drifting in 
pack ice having been wrenched from its moorings in the harsh and 
freezing conditions.

According to Shackleton, Stenhouse ‘accomplished one of the most 
difficult journeys on record’ by sailing the ship 1,000 miles to New 
Zealand and saving the crew.

Upon his return to Britain, the First World War was in full swing and 
Stenhouse went on to serve on the secretive Q-ship PQ61 that was famous 
for its concealed weaponry.

Hero: His medals are expected to fetch £25,000 when they go under the hammer at Dix Noonan Webb saleroom in London on Wednesday

In September 1917 the vessel engaged and sank a U-boat in the Irish sea for which Stenhouse was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

He was duly promoted and later joined Shackleton on a mission to 
Murmansk to equip and train the north Russian, anti-Bolshevik army.

At the age of 52, Stenhouse signed on for active service after the outbreak of the Second World War.

In 1940 in the Gulf of Aden his ship was mined and 11 men were killed but he risked his own life to save a crew member.

He was killed the following year after his ship, HMS Sheba, exploded in the Red Sea.

Original: This telegram from Shackleton to Stenhouse is to thank him and his crew for their heroic efforts in the Antarctic

Christopher Hill, from Dix Noonan Webb auction house, said: 'This group of medals 
encapsulates one of the great British stories of pluck and luck - with 
all the key ingredients of heroism, leadership, exploration and that 
essential British character of “never say die”.

'And those who saw that wonderful BBC programme of Shackleton’s 1914-16 
expedition to the Antarctic starring Sir Kenneth Branagh will remember 
just what a truly amazing bunch of men they were.

'And to think that having survived all that, many not only went on like 
Stenhouse to be heroes again in the latter part of World War One, but 
then lost their lives also.

'These men’s memories deserve to be remembered and told through their medals.'
