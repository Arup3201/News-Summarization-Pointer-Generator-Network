A Fathers4Justice campaigner is staging a one-man protest - on the roof of Justice Secretary Chris Grayling’s home.

Campaign organisers say Martin Matthews has erected a tent on top of the house in Ashtead, Surrey - and has enough supplies to keep him going for 'at least five days'.

Mr Matthews scaled the roof using a ladder before unfurling a banner reading: 'No rights? Go MAD. Mums and Dads United.'

Police have been called to the scene of the protest and say officers are speaking to the campaigner and 'closely monitoring' the situation.

A spokesman for New Fathers4Justice said Mr Matthews clambered on to the roof of the Epsom and Ewell MP's home at around 9pm last night and is refusing to come down.

The spokesman said: 'He has a tent, a mobile phone with batteries and food and water so he could spend at least five days up there.

'Knowing Martin he will want to stay up longer. It's almost a competition for him.

'It will take a lot for him to come down - probably it will take Chris Grayling to come and actually speak to him.'

He said Mr Matthews was campaigning for an 'open and transparent family court system'. It is not the first time he has singled out Chris Grayling in his protests.

Martin Matthews is believed to have enough supplies - including food, water and a mobile phone - to last him at least five days

The campaigner has unfurled a poster which includes the words: 'No rights? Go MAD. Mums and Dads United.'

On Fathers' Day, 2013 and in October 2012, he climbed on to the Cabinet member's constituency office, also in Ashtead. 

The New Fathers4Justice website confirmed it is Martin Matthews carrying out the protest.

It said: 'No parent who is fit and willing should ever be denied their right to share equally in the lives of their own children.

'Yet our very own government, our judiciary, our media and society as a whole still openly displays what is nothing less than an act of abuse upon our children against non resident parents. And everybody knows it.

'We also want an end to forced adoption where profit is put before the best interests of children.

'We are not going away, we are getting stronger each and every day, we are in fact fighting for our children and there is no greater cause than that, our children.'

A Surrey Police spokesman said officers were called to an address in Ashtead just after noon today after a report of a trespasser at the home.

'Officers attended the scene and located a man who claims he is holding a protest. Police are closely monitoring the situation. 

'Officers are speaking with the man who is currently on the roof of the property and appropriate updates will follow in due course.'

Chris Grayling's office has been contacted by MailOnline for a comment.
