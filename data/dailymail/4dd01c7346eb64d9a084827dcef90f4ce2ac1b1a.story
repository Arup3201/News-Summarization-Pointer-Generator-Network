He did have a long way to travel – but it was still embarrassing for George Osborne when he turned up late for a power-photo in Australia yesterday.

The Chancellor’s cheeks flushed as he was greeted with a chorus of ironic cheers from fellow finance ministers when he finally appeared for an official snap of G20 summit participants, taken against the striking backdrop of Sydney’s Harbour Bridge and Opera House.

The late arrival meant that Mr Osborne was forced to take up a spot at the far back corner.

About time: The Chancellor turns up to the power-photo where every finance minister is already stood

We're waiting: He takes a time check as all the others look on and chuckle at his lateness

The Chancellor had to make his way to his place by walking in front of the gathering.

From the front row, his friend, former French finance minister Christine Lagarde – who he recommended for her current post as head of the International Monetary Fund – shot him an amused look.

Mr Osborne’s embarrassment was compounded as Bank of England governor Mark Carney made the line-up in good time.

Ministers and bank governors from the 20 largest economies are meeting to discuss how to boost jobs and growth.
