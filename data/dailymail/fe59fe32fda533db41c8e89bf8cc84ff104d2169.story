Fulham are in talks to sign striker Jermaine Beckford from Bolton. 

Beckford, 30, joined Bolton from Leicester last year but has only one year on his contract. 

Fulham are interested in proven Championship signings as they offload high-earning Premier League players.

Goals guaranteed? Fulham want the striker to bolster their forward line but he has not been prolific recently

The Craven Cottage club have already spend £11million on Ross McCormack from Leeds, but the Scottish striker has not been able to prevent a shocking start to life back in the second tier.

It is only three years since Beckford moved from Everton to Leicester on deadline day for £2.5m. 

The striker has since played for Huddersfield and Bolton, but has not scored more than ten league goals in a Championship season since he left Leeds in 2010.
