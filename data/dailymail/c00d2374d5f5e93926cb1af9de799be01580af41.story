Quel horreur: Rouge Sucette, which means red lollipop, is designed to win new wine fans

A French drinks company is launching a red wine that will have the edge on its competitors - by adding a dash of cola.

In a break with tradition Rouge Sucette, French for red lollipop, is made from 75 per cent grapes with water, sugar and cola flavouring making up the remainder.

Sure to horrify connoisseurs, it is designed to appeal to the younger 'Coke generation'.

Winemakers fear that young people who drink endless spirits and mixers will be difficult to attract if they do not adapt to their sweet palette.

The 9 per cent ABV blend is part of a 
new range by Aquitaine-based firm Haussmann Famille.

They also make fruity 
Passion Fruit and Grape Fruit blends.

The company recommends serving it ice-cold for the summer weather.

It went on sale this week for 2.95 euros a bottle and is hoped to become a feature of French barbeques and summer drinks parties.

Pauline Lacombe, Marketing Director of Haussmann Famille, said: 'The result is surprising; the balance between the bitterness of the wine and the sweetness of the cola is perfect.'

'We did a lot of research to elaborate the best recipe and the best mix between wine, water and the aroma.

'The packaging is fun, with a label in the shape of lollipop.

'This kind of product is more dedicated to young adults, and women.

Young fans: The French company is hoping a wine as sweet as cola will appeal to young drinkers who prefer spirits and mixers

'We have worked closely with a lab in Bordeaux, specialised in aroma.'

Despite having a reputation for their snobbish attitude to wine, the French themselves have actually embraced flavoured wines, drinking a predicted 30 million bottles in 2013.

Cola wine could also be a big hit in Britain, as sugar consumption has increased by 31 per cent since 1990, with the average person consuming 700g of sugar a week.
