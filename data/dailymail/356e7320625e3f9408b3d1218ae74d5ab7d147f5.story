The Miracle Baby of Pan Am Flight 759 is now 33, a mother herself, and has spoken out about the 1982 tragedy following its recent anniversary.

Melissa 'Missy' Trahan was 16 months old when she was found amidst the rubble left when a 727 was smashed into a Kenner, Louisiana neighborhood by a weather anomaly 32 years ago this past July 9.

Trahan's mother and 4-year-old sister were among the 8 victims killed on the ground when the Las Vegas-bound flight went down just after takeoff.

Missy Trahan was once famously dubbed the Miracle Baby of Pan Am Flight 759, which killed 146 people on board and eight in the neighborhood it all but razed in 1982, before she was pulled out from under debris with only minor burns at 16-months-old

Horrific: Pan Am Flight 759 went down due to a severe microburst one minute after take-off. The plane razed six homes in Kenner and ruined countless lives, but Trahan has managed to thrive

Unbelievable: Fifteen homes were obliterated or damaged by the massive commercial aircraft as it ripped through a Kenner neighborhood

Now a mother herself, Trahan tells the New Orleans Times-Picayune she's moved on but not forgotten her beginnings as the Pan Am Miracle Baby.

'I was so fortunate to be surrounded by a loving family, including my grandparents from both sides,' she told the Times-Picayune.

Trahan grabbed national headlines after she was pulled from under some debris with just superficial burns following the horrific crash.

The plane razed six houses as it went down and destroyed countless lives in Kenner.

All 146 people on board also perished.

Tribute: Trahan lost her mother and 4-year-old sister in the horrific crash but is now the mother of her own 4-year-old daughter, Melanie, who is named after Trahan's mother

Facing fears: Trahan left Kenner behind when her father took her from the town that harbored so many ghosts for them following the crash. However, she's now back in New Orleans and thriving

Staying strong: Trahan even spoke to and comforted loved ones of victims of the terrible accident at a 2012 memorial commemorating the tragedy's 30th anniversary

Trahan and her father picked up and moved out of Kenner and for years she lived her life away from the New Orleans area including a stint working in Orlando.

But Crescent City eventually called her back despite the ghosts from her past. In 2010 she married her 'boy next door' Joe Ferrera.

The happy couple now have a 4-year-old daughter named after Trahan's late mother, Melanie.

'I've been given something that nobody else has,' Trahan told WWLTV. 'I was given a second chance.'

Authorities at the scene had to create a makeshift morgue at the crash site and the emotional scars left by Flight 759 continued to linger long after the neighborhood was restored

Despite the line of strong storms coming through, the plane was cleared for take off from Louis Armstrong Int'l Airport
