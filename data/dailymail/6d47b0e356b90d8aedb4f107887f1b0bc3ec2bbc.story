Divers have discovered an array of precious artefacts from a Greek shipwreck located 40 miles north of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea.

The team of divers, who were specially trained in Florida's deep underwater caves, went to depths of over 400 feet to retrieve the items which were too deep for most divers.

The shipwrecked Panarea II and III vessels were first discovered four years ago in the deep waters of Capistello Bay by researchers using sonar gear and a submarine.

Cargo: A plethora of amphorae, or large urns, cover the sea basin 410 feet underwater

The unusual depths made the operation of successfully bringing the precious items to the surface a complicated exercise.

Florida-based divers and archaeologists from Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) were recently assigned to work with researchers to piece together the mysteries of the ancient shipwreck.

The divers and archaeologists found an ancient pile of amphorae, or large urns, which were used to transport cargo such as olives and wine in the ancient world.

The team also found a sacrificial altar which was inscribed with Greek lettering.

The government has asked the divers  to document the list of precious items they find and then return to excavate them at a later stage.

Archaeologists believe the ship sailed around 218-210 BC, during the time of the second Punic Wars.
