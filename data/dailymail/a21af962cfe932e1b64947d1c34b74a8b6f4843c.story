Stoke boss Mark Hughes believes former Barcelona forward Bojan Krkic has found his feet in England and can be a big hit in the Barclays Premier League this season.

Many were surprised when Bojan swapped the Nou Camp for the Britannia in a £3million-move in the summer and the former Barca trainee enjoyed a promising start, scoring three times during pre-season.

Bojan struggled to transfer that form into the first few games of the Premier League season but the 24-year-old started and scored a superb opening goal in Stoke's 2-1 victory at Tottenham on Sunday.

'We're really pleased he's finally come to the fore,' Hughes said.

'He started like a house on fire in pre-season and I think people got a bit carried away too early - we all felt it was going to take him time to adjust.

'I played him the first two games and he found it difficult to have an impact.

'He's bided his time though and we've reintroduced him now and he's had the benefit of three or four months training at the intensity he needs and he's looking a very accomplished player again.'

Bojan was considered one of the most talented strikers in Europe while he was coming through the ranks at Barcelona but the Spaniard was unable to live up to expectations during loan spells at Roma, AC Milan and Ajax.

Hughes, however, believes the creative forward has the strengths to be a success in the Premier League.

'We're going to benefit from his ability and his goalscoring because he's a good talent when he gets in good areas of the field,' Hughes added.

'He gets shots off early and its difficult for keepers to react quickly enough. He'll score goals for us this year.'
