Boris Johnson today called for the removal of the Tower of London's field of ceramic poppies to be delayed, to give more time for people to see the stunning display.

The London Mayor has issued a direct plea to organisers to extend the exhibition beyond next week's deadline of November 12, when up to four million people are expected to have paid tribute at the display of 888,246 poppies in the Tower's moat on the bank of the River Thames. 

The vast installation, Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red by ceramic artist Paul Cummins, has captured the public imagination as the nation marks 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War. 

All of the poppies have been sold, at £25 each, with buyers hoping to have them in time for Christmas.

The poppies have gradually been added in recent weeks, and has nearly reached completion ahead of Armistice Day on Tuesday, November 11. 

Historic Royal Palaces plans to then start the process of dismantling the exhibition. The poppies have been sold for charity, and people who have bought them have already been warned they will not get them until the New Year.

But Mr Johnson has called for the closure to be delayed to give more people chance to see it, with many travelling from across the country to catch a glimpse.

Mr Johnson told the Evening Standard said: 'The poppy field at the Tower is a unique and poignant focus of remembrance in this centenary year.

'It has grown rapidly in popularity, to such an extent that it is now a global visitor attraction.

'I'm keen to explore whether we can keep the exhibition open for longer, to give as many people as possible the chance to glimpse something so incredible, whilst easing the pressure on numbers.'

Talks: A spokesman for the mayor said he was in discussion with Historic Royal Palaces about extending the exhibition for a further week.

Sales: But Historic Royal Palaces said it was always the intention to begin sending the poppies to their new owners after Armistice Day

Memorial: By November 11, there will be 888,246 ceramic poppies at the site, one for each British and colonial death during the First World War

Dismantling: Eleven thousand volunteers will then begin removing the installation from November 12, Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said

Funds: Royal British Legion said it hopes the sale of the poppies - which were available to buy for £25 each - will raise in excess of £15 million

London Mayor Boris Johnson, who sold poppies last week with actor Brian Blessed, has issued a plea to organisers to delay the process of removing the poppies

A spokesman for the mayor said he was in discussion with Historic Royal Palaces, the agency which runs the Tower of London, about extending the exhibition for a further week.

But Historic Royal Palaces said today that it was always the intention to begin sending the poppies - which have been sold to raise cash for charity - to their new owners after Armistice Day on November 11.

A spokeswoman said: 'We have been overwhelmed by the support from the public for Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, our installation of ceramic poppies in the moat at the Tower of London.

'It has always been intended that the poppies will be in place until November 11 and after this time they will be cleaned and sent out to all those that have purchased them.

'The transience of the installation is key to the artistic concept, with the dispersal of the poppies into hundreds of thousands of homes marking the final phase of this evolving installation.

'We are currently planning further ways in which the Tower of London will be marking the coming years of the centenary and the legacy of the poppies in the moat.'

The Queen and Prince Philip walked among the ceramic poppies last month, as volunteers continued the painstaking process of planting the thousands of poppies

When the poppy field was first launched in August, the Duchess of Cambridge was one of the first high profile visitors to the site

By November 11, there will be 888,246 ceramic poppies planted at the site, one for each British and colonial death during the First World War, which began 100 years ago.

Eleven thousand volunteers will then begin removing the installation from November 12, Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said on Twitter.

Royal British Legion said it hopes the sale of the poppies - which were available to buy for £25 each - will raise in excess of £15 million. Buyers of the poppies could be left disappointed if the arrival of theirs was postponed because of an extension to the memorial.

Rehema Figueiredo, 23, from Balham, south London, who bought two, said she was expecting to receive hers not to long after Remembrance Day to pass them on as gifts.

'I bought two as presents for people who had relatives that were lost in the war and they will be most upset that they won't get their poppies in time.

'I bought mine maybe a month and a half ago so I've already been waiting that long for it to come and it's a bit disappointing to think that we will be waiting even longer.'

The public were urged to postpone their visits to the poppy field last week due to overcrowding during the school half-term holiday.

Phil Hufton, London Underground's chief operating officer, said Tower Hill station near the memorial had been 'extremely busy' and occasionally the station was being closed on police advice.

Transport for London has urged visitors to the Tower of London to travel to nearby Tube stations Aldgate or Aldgate East or take the DLR to Tower Gateway.

Commuters have also been asked to consider travelling to London Bridge and then walk, cycle or take a bus. Motorists have also been advised not to drive in the area.

One beneficiary from the sale of the poppies, military charity SSAFA, backed the closure of the exhibition next week.

A spokeswoman said: 'Its transience is part of the overall artistic concept. Given that around four million people are thought to have visited the poppies, we appreciate that Historic Royal Palaces now needs to fulfil its obligation to those who have bought a poppy, and thereby generously supported the charities who are benefiting from the proceeds from their sale.'
