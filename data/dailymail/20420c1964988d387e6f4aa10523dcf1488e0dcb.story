Gazing out of his window Brian Jordan gasped as he spotted a giant dog-shaped cloud looming in the sky above his home.

The 67-year-old retired logistics manager said he was amazed when he saw what resembled a French poodle staring back at him.

He said: 'It is not every day you see a cloud that looks like a giant French dog.'

Brian Jordan, a retired logistics manager, said he was amazed when he spotted the giant dog-shaped cloud in the sky above his home on the Wirral

Mr Jordan said he walked into his lounge, where he was confronted by the unusual sight, through his front window at home on the Wirral in Cheshire.

The grandfather grabbed a camera and took this hilarious image.

He said: “I walked into my lounge with a cup of coffee and saw this out of the front window, I took the picture through the glass but you can still tell it looks like a poodle.

“I picked up a little Fuji camera and got the photograph. I don’t go round looking up at the sky for this kind of thing - it was just right there.'
