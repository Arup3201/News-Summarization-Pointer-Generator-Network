A prison guard was killed and five of his colleagues were injured last night during a nine-hour riot as up to 300 inmates held dozens of hostages at a jail containing thousands of illegal immigrants.

The unnamed 23-year-old is thought to have been fatally smashed over the head with a makeshift weapon during the melee at the Adams County Correctional Center near Natchez, Mississippi.

Three inmates were also hurt - with one suffering stab wounds - during clashes which officials claim were sparked by a power struggle between gangs but prisoners blame on 'mistreatment' by guards.

At one point during the standoff, 15 employees were freed after the guards, who do not have guns, opened a section of fence while this exit route was protected by armed law enforcement officers.

No prisoners escaped during the melee in which prisoners lit several fires around the complex that burned well into the night.

Smoke rose above the razor wire-rimmed private facility that holds more than 2,500 prisoners while clouds of choking pepper spray also clogged the air after the riot began at 2.40pm yesterday.

The riot finally ended at around 11.30pm after Sheriff and SWAT teams caged all of the inmates, who armed themselves with trash can lids, mop handles and wood ripped from bunk beds and bleachers.

Adams County Coroner James Lee confirmed that a guard died, but said he could not provide any other details until the officer's family was notified.

The five injured guards were taken to a hospital and treated for injuries that weren't considered life-threatening.

Among the hurt inmates, one was being treated for a stab wound, another concussion and a third rib injuries.

An investigation has been launched to establish how the riot began and who is responsible for the death, injuries and damage to the prison owned by the Corrections Corporation of America.

Adams County Sheriff Chuck Mayfield, who said two dozen hostages were taken, told the Natchez Democrat newspaper the riot had an initially been attributed to a power struggle between inmates.

But some prisoners have claimed the riot began amid a protest over the alleged mistreatment by guards.

'They always beat us and hit us. We just pay them back,' one inmate told WAPT TV News based in the state capital of Jackson.

'We are trying to get better food, medical programs, clothes, and we're trying to get some respect from the officers and lieutenants.'

The 2,567-bed prison houses adult male illegal immigrants for the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Most will be deported once they have completed their sentences.

CCA spokesman Steve Owen confirmed in an email ‘there has been one employee death’ but he said he could not provide more details immediately.

He said in an email early Monday ‘it is my understanding that all staff are accounted for.’ He said the company was investigating what prompted the uprising.

Adams County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Emily Ham said no inmates had escaped the facility.

After the uprising began, CCA's Special Response Team and the Mississippi Highway Patrol's SWAT team sought to quell activities within the prison while state and local law-enforcement officers secured the perimeter of the complex, Adams County Sheriff Chuck Mayfield said in a statement.

Mayfield added that prison personnel had ‘gained total control’ of the complex.
