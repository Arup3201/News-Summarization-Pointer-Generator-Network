Sunderland fans have had to fight sleep more than any other supporters to catch their team on the main Match of the Day programme so far this season.

Gus Poyet's team have occupied the bottom slot - which usually airs close to or just after midnight - seven times, once more than goal-shy Aston Villa and twice more than Crystal Palace and Swansea.

The one time Black Cats fans did get to see their side in the prized opening slot was the 8-0 drubbing at Southampton on October 18. They also lost both times they were on second - at home to Arsenal on October 25 and at Manchester City on New Year's Day.

Sunderland have topped the bill only once and that was when they were beaten 8-0 by Southampton 

The BBC's head of football, Mark Cole, thinks the statistic could bode well for the 16th-placed Wearsiders.

He said: 'It's not personal. We've got a couple of Sunderland fans in the office and the chap who does all our stats is a Sunderland fan so he's keeping a particular eye on it.

'If they're on last by the end of the season the most, then it means they'll still be in the Premier League, because they won't be drawn into those big relegation battles that feature highly in the programme.'

League leaders Chelsea have been on first the most so far - seven times - when looking at every Saturday night Match of the Day Premier League highlights programme since the start of the season, plus the three festive editions on Boxing Day, December 28 and New Year's Day.

We looked at every Saturday night Premier League highlights programme, plus the three festive editions on Boxing Day, December 28 and New Year's Day of Match of the Day this season to see how popular your team is... 

ARSENAL: Arsene's entertainers have featured in the top three on nine occasions, and have never been on last.

ASTON VILLA: The Premier League's lowest scorers have been bottom of the bill six times - once less than Sunderland. They have not featured in the top match all season - only Stoke can match that - but have been in the top three five times.

BURNLEY: Sean Dyche's men were first on in the last Saturday night highlights show on January 17 against Crystal Palace, with the reverse fixture at Selhurst Park bottom of the bill on September 13.

CHELSEA: Jose Mourinho's men are top of the league and top of the bill more than anyone else - seven first-place appearances so far.

CRYSTAL PALACE: The Eagles' win at Burnley on January 17 is their one and only appearance in top spot so far. They have been last on five times.

EVERTON: Top of the bill twice in as many weeks in late August with a 2-2 draw against Arsenal and a 6-3 defeat against Chelsea, both at Goodison Park. They have not been back in top spot since.

HULL: Three appearances in top spot for the Tigers - two in consecutive weekends on September 20 and 27 - but no wins. Three appearances in the bottom spot too.

LEICESTER: The Foxes may be bottom of the table but curiously have been third on more than any other side - five times in total.

LIVERPOOL: The Reds finished second in the Premier League last season but their comparative struggles this time around are reflected by the fact that they have been on last three times.

MANCHESTER CITY: The Blues have featured first five times - second only to Chelsea - and in the top three 15 times, more than any other club.

MANCHESTER UNITED: Louis van Gaal's men have only topped the bill twice, and have featured in the top three six times in their 11 appearances in the shows surveyed.

NEWCASTLE: A very even spread for the Magpies - three times in top spot, including the day they ended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season on December 6, twice second, twice third and twice last.

QPR: They may be 19th but their four appearances in the top slot is second only to the league's top two Chelsea and Manchester City. Only one appearance at the bottom of the bill.

SOUTHAMPTON: Saints have been first on just once - the 8-0 hammering of Sunderland - and have made only two further appearances in the top three, despite being third in the league.

STOKE: Along with Villa the only side yet to feature in the top match. Six top-three appearances and three bottom-of-the-bill showings for the Potters.

SUNDERLAND: Appear to have drawn the short straw. Last on the programme a table-topping seven times, with one win and four defeats to show from their five top-three appearances, with one of those losses the pasting at St Mary's.

SWANSEA: Garry Monk's men may be irked to discover that they have been bottom of the bill more than any other side in the top half - five times in total. It all started so well - they were first on with their win at Old Trafford on the opening day.

TOTTENHAM: Spurs' appearances in the programmes covered by our survey have been limited to 11 this season, primarily caused by their Europa League involvement, but just four top-three appearances in total does still seem a rather slim return.

WEST BROM: Despite their struggles this season, the Baggies have not featured in the bottom spot once. They have been on first three times so far, but all three matches were defeats.

WEST HAM: The highest-placed side to feature at the bottom of the bill - their 0-0 draw with Villa at Upton Park on November 8.

The running order for each week's Match of the Day is a hot topic amongst supporters and how it is decided is top on the list of 'Frequently Asked Questions' on the MOTD website.

Explaining the process, Cole said: 'At the start of the week the editor will have a plan of how he expects it to pan out and the length of each individual match to make sure you can fit it in that BBC1 slot. Then it's constantly changing.

'At half-time you'll perhaps have another look, and then at full-time. There's also the added complication of a 5.30pm game most Saturdays so you'll have a plan and then it can be thrown out of the window by what happens in that game.

'It's a collective operation but essentially it's the editor's decision, so he'll make that decision after talking to the presenter, the pundits, some of the match directors.

Manchester United and QPR have topped the Match of the Day bill on six occasions between them this term 

Arsenal, in action during their recent win over Manchester City, have featured first on just two occasions 

'What you're trying to look at in a nutshell is what game do people sat at home at 10.30pm on a Saturday night want to watch most?

'There's a combination of factors that go into that. People want to see the teams at the top, there's interest in relegation battles, but also what the game's been like. Goals do have a massive impact in where you are in the running order for Match of the Day.'

The rise of social media has enabled fans to interact directly with the programme, its main presenter, Gary Lineker, and pundits.

The running order is now announced on Twitter ahead of the programme on a Saturday evening and flagged up throughout the broadcast.

Cole said: 'Certainly the advent of Twitter and social media has made it even more hotly contested and fans aren't backward in coming forward to let us know their views.

Crystal Palace, 13th in the Premier League table, have been last on Match of the Day five times

'But all we try and do is be honest and say that we're looking at it from people at home's point of view and what games they want to watch.

'We think it's important we take each programme on its merits. Across the course of the season, each team should have their time in the spotlight, certainly if they score some goals. Last season 19 out of the 20 clubs led the programme, and this season 18 have halfway through it.

'It's great to have people talking about your programme and we love social media. You have got to be careful not to take some of the comments personally.

'Match of the Day is an institution and it's absolutely phenomenal the way people still watch a highlights programme. It's when people aren't talking about you that you get worried.'

Manchester City have been on first the second-most times (five) and have appeared in the top three games more than any other side - 15 times in total to Chelsea's 13. 

Manchester United have been first on only twice - two times fewer than second-bottom QPR - but along with Tottenham have been on the main programme the fewest times - with only 11 appearances.
