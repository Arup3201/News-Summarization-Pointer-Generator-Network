Despite his extensive top level experience and a mantlepiece packed with medals, Ashley Cole appeared to be playing the role of new kid at school in a photo with his Roma team-mates.

The former England and Chelsea star moved to the Serie A club on a free transfer in July, ending a glittering eight-year stay at Stamford Bridge.

But when the Italian side got together for a team picture at training, Cole was left on the periphery, some way away from the rest of the squad.

Cole played his second pre-season 
friendly for Roma against old foes Manchester United, where he was on 
the wrong end of a 3-2 defeat.

He
 caught up with former England team-mate Wayne Rooney and ex-Chelsea pal Juan Mata, who both netted for Louis van Gaal's side in a match 
notable for Miralem Pjanic's 60-yard wonder strike.

Roma's next challenge on Wednesday will be the most demanding of their US tour
 as they take on Real Madrid in the International Champions Cup at the 
Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas.
