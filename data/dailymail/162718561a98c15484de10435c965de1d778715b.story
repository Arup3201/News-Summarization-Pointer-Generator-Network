Philip Davies, Conservative Party MP, says that there is a deep disparity in how much spending goes towards different arts, with certain music like brass bands going overlooked

A Yorkshire MP has revealed the gulf in funding between opera for southern ‘luvvies’ and brass bands in the North’s working-class towns.

Conservative Philip Davies has uncovered figures which show that opera is in line to receive £347million during the five years of the  current Parliament, compared with £1.8million for brass bands.

He pointed out that most of the Arts Council’s funding for opera is for London and the South East, and that northern MPs had a long-standing concern that their local brass bands have not been getting a ‘fair lick of the saucepot’.

He said: ‘There’s a massive disparity in the figures. The overwhelming majority of that funding is for London and the South East.

‘The question symbolises an issue that many people in the North  have with the relative funding of the Arts Council.

‘Brass bands may be perceived as working-class and opera as middle and upper-class things.

‘I think perhaps there is a worry that in effect the middle-class lobby at the Arts Council are keen to fund the things that middle-class luvvies like. That’s a concern.’

Brass bands have only received around £1.8 million from the government funding, far less that opera's £347 million over the last five years

Opera has long been seen as a rather more middle to upper-class enjoyment than something like brass bands, which some believe involve the community a lot more

Shipley MP Mr Davies, who unearthed 
the figures through a parliamentary question, is a member of the 
Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee which is currently conducting 
an inquiry into arts funding across the country.

He added: ‘I’ve been in Parliament for nine years. There’s been a long-standing concern among Yorkshire MPs of all parties that this is an issue and that brass bands haven’t been getting a fair lick of the saucepot.

‘Brass bands are really an essential part of the local community all over the country, particularly for people like us in the North.

‘In Bradford, where I am, we are particularly proud of the Black Dyke Band. They provide an awful lot of pleasure and are also an essential part of the local community.

‘I think most people find the disparity in funding too much but the figures are there and people will draw their own conclusions.’
