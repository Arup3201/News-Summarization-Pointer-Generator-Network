Bono and the rest of U2 have pulled out of a TV appearance after the frontman fell off his bike in Central Park on Sunday.

The band canceled their weeklong 'residency' on NBC's Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon after the 'spill', in which Bono, 54, hurt his arm.

In a statement on their website, Bono's bandmates - Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen and The Edge - wrote that the rocker hurt his arm when he took a tumble in the middle of New York City, and will need minor surgery.

They wrote: 'It looks like we will have to do our Tonight Show residency another time - we're one man down.

'Bono has injured his arm in a cycling spill in Central Park and requires some surgery to repair it. 

'We're sure he'll make a full recovery soon, so we'll be back! Much thanks to Jimmy Fallon and everyone at the show for their understanding.'

It tops off an unfortunate week for the Irish singer, who was also inches from disaster in an air accident.

Other mishfortune: It comes days after Bono's private jet (pictured) lost a door in mid-air

While flying to an airport in Berlin, Germany, on Wednesday, the hatch fell off his $78million private Learjet and smashed into the ground near the city's Schoenefeld airport.

Bono and his flying companions lost their luggage in the accident, but none of the seven people on board was hurt.

Speaking to the Irish Daily Mail after the incident, a source said: 'He was extremely lucky, the plane could have gone down.

About an hour into the journey they heard a big thud coming from the rear of the plane... They were at an altitude where anything could have happened and they are all feeling very lucky to be alive.’

Bono is a keen cyclist, and was photographed this summer heading out for a ride with his wife Alison Hewson near their French holiday home in Eze-sur-Mer, France.

The couple were both wearing helmets on that occasion, but didn't have extra safety gear life elbow or knee pads. Bono head earphones in and was listening to music as he rode.
