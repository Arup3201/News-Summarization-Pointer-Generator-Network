NASCAR champion Tony Stewart has said he does not need to speak to the family of the 20-year-old driver he killed for closure.

At a press conference in Kannapolis, North Carolina on Monday  - his first since he  struck Kevin Ward Jr. on an upstate New York dirt-track last month - Stewart said he has offered to speak to the family.

'I want to be available to them if they want to talk about it,' he said. 'At this point, I don't need to talk to them for closure. I know what happened and I know it was an accident.'

When asked if there is anything he would have done differently the night of  August 9, he said he would have skipped the race at Canandaigua Motorsports Park altogether.

A changed man: He said that life will never be the same but that he hopes to return to race driving 

'I'd have stayed at Watkins Glen that night,' he said. 'It wasn't a big-paying race, I just wanted to go run my sprint car for a night. I do it to have fun and it didn't end up being fun that night.'

After weeks of being secluded in his home, he now hopes to venture out more and thank the people who have given him support over the past several weeks, he said.

'I don't know if it'll ever be normal again,' he said. 'Before the accident, a day would fly by me. Now a day seems like two-three days. Like the batteries are running low on the clock.'

He added that he doesn't know when he will race again, but has not written off returning to the sport.

'I love what I do,' he said. 'I love driving race cars. I think it might change as far as how much of it and what I would do. That would take a lot to stop.'

Ward and Stewart had been racing for position at Canandaigua Motorsports Park in upstate New York on August 9 when Ward crashed - apparently after being struck by Stewart's vehicle.   

The younger driver climbed out of his car and walked down the dark track in an apparent attempt to confront Stewart. A toxicology report found Ward also had marijuana in his system.

Stewart slammed into the young driver as he walked on the track, killing him.

Last week, a grand jury concluded they would not indict him in the death. At the press conference, Stewart said he was glad with the outcome.

'I would be lying if I said there wasn't a piece of relief, but that was very short-lived in my heart,' he said. 'It went right back to the fact that we lost Kevin. We lost a young driver that had a lot of talent.'

Ward's family has said 'the matter is not at rest,' and Stewart may still face a civil lawsuit. 

'Our son got out of his car during caution while the race was suspended, all other vehicles were reducing speed and not accelerating, except for Tony Stewart who intentionally tried to intimidate Kevin but accelerating and sliding his car towards him causing this tragedy,' Pamela Ward said in a statement to CBS News last week.

In an earlier interview, Stewart, one of NASCAR's biggest stars, described the  weeks he spent in seclusion after the crash as the darkest of his life.

He explained that there were days when he couldn't get out of bed and it was a chore to take a shower or leave his room. He said he didn't care about racing and didn't want to speak to anybody.   

'You are part of something so tragic and so unthinkable, it's hard to face anybody,' he said. 'You are scared to be around anybody, you are embarrassed to be around anybody because of what happened.'

He went on: 'There hasn't been a day that's gone by that I haven't thought about it. And it will be like that all your life... It's going to be a part of me forever.'
