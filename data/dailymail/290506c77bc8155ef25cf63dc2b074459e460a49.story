Lone survivor: Bradley Morales, 16 (pictured), was driving without a license around 2am on Saturday when he lost control of his 1995 BMW and crashed, killing all five of his passengers. Morales survived, and underwent surgery for a skull fracture 

California Highway Patrol continues to investigate a fiery car crash that killed five 14- and 15-year-olds returning home from a trip to Knott's Berry Farm this weekend. 

The lone survivor of that crash has since been identified as 16-year-old Bradley Morales, who is not licensed to drive. 

The crash happened around 2am Saturday as Morales was behind the wheel, driving his friends home from the amusement park's Halloween attraction, when the 1995 BMW hit a guardrail, rolled off an embankment then caught fire.

Morales was either ejected from the vehicle or escaped before the fire broke out, but the three boys and two girls inside were not as lucky. 

The three male victims have been identified as Alex Sotelo, Matthew Melo and Brandon Moreno, who were all on the same soccer team. Laguna Hills High School student Jenny Mills was one of the females inside, while the other girl remains unidentified. 

The three male victims, from Mission Viejo, were identified by their soccer coach, who realized something had gone wrong when they failed to turn up for Saturday morning's game.

Billy McNicoll told how Alex, his team's top goal-scorer, and Matt were well-established players, while Brandon was a newer addition. Their loss hit the team hard.

Speaking to the LA Times, he said: 'These are good boys. We are devastated. Just devastated.'

Alex and Matthew were ninth-graders at Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo, while Brandon was in the eighth grade at Carl Hankey Middle School in the same town. 

CHP Officer Florentine Oliva said skids marks on the freeway indicate speed may have played a role in the crash.  Investigators will also survey the damaged vehicle to check for signs of mechanical failure. CHP Sgt Todd Kovaletz said there is no indication drugs or alcohol were involved in the crash.

Both girls and one of the boys appear not to have been wearing seatbelts.

Morales was rushed to Mission Hospital on Saturday where he was underwent surgery for a skull fracture. However, he was last listed in serious but stable condition. 

It took emergency responders about 30 minutes to put out the blaze sparked by the crash,  during which time they were unable to approach the vehicle to attempt a rescue of the victims. 

'This is one of the worst accidents a number of both CHP officers and firefighters have witnessed. To have five fatalities in one vehicle was extremely tragic today,' Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdai told ABC 7.

Firefighters arrived at the scene in Irvine, California, to find five badly-burned bodies inside the charred BMW

The crash was one of two that happened just hours apart in Southern California that killed 10 people, including three members of the same teen soccer team and four recent graduates of the same high school. 

Five more people were killed about five hours earlier on Friday night, when three vehicles collided on an isolated two-lane road on the edge of Chino, a city east of Los Angeles in San Bernardino County. Authorities were working to identify the dead and determine the cause Saturday afternoon, police spokeswoman Monica Gutierrez said.

The lone survivor of the three-vehicle crash - the driver of a Honda Civic - was released from the hospital, Gutierrez said. The dead included four in a Chevy truck and one in a Honda Accord.

The victims in the truck included 19-year-old Andrew Anthony Deleon, 18-year-old Nathan Dominguez and two other friends, all recent graduates from the same high school, Dominguez's uncle Anthony Vasquez and coroner's officials said.
