As news broke yesterday that Australia will be competing in this year's Eurovision Song Contest for the first time, the internet imploded with a long list of questionable suggestions on who should represent the Land Down Under.

So far the lucky Australian performer, who will sing in front of an estimated 195 million people, is still yet to be picked, with many names being thrown around including; Sia, Iggy Azalea and Samantha Jade, to name a few famous Aussies.  

But many Australians  are gunning for the underdog and already petitions and Twitter hashtags have been created in the hope of sending a more unconventional act to Vienna in May.

Australian performer Dame Edna Everage's legion of fans have taken to social media to petition for her to represent Australia in the Eurovision

A Change.org petition has been launched by Australian Andrew Wade begging his fellow countrymen to sign on and make 2015 'EuroTISM' in the hope that the anonymous rock band TISM from Melbourne will reunite for the big event.

'We, the undersigned, humbly request that landmark Australian rock band reform and take charge of the stage. Since you left us in 2004, we've had a never ending parade of gormless depressing electro-indie, depressing indie-folk, and depressing Aussie hip-hop,' the Change.org page says. 

'We the undersigned, ask that you get on stage in front of the world and remind them of just how great Australian music is.'

In just one day, the petition has been signed over 8,900 times, with only 3,500 more signatures needed before it reaches it's quota.

Dame Edna is just one of a range of unconventional celebrities whose names have appeared on social media 

Hollywood Actor Hugh Jackman and Pince Philip have been named online as possible entrants for the Eurovision 2015 in May

This year, not only will voters be able to back Australia, but the country will be fast-tracked to the final to celebrate the contest's 60th anniversary in May.

The Twitter hashtag #EmRuscianoForEurovision is gaining momentum online. The popular comedian's name has popped up on the social media account with many people getting behind the performer. 

Rusciano is a TV and radio presenter with experience singing and performing in musicals and may be Australia's golden ticket for the Eurovision win. 

Jackman has appeared in many musicals including Oklahoma and Les Misérables

Hugh Jackman's fans have tagged him in a Twitter hashtag started to suggest famous names who should appear in the Eurovision 

After Prince Philip received an Australian knighthood many joked he would be the perfect man to represent Australia 

While Prince Philip is not from Australia, Twitter users seem to think he could be drafted in to help the Aussies win the European competition 

Last year's winner: Conchita Wurst, a bearded drag queen from Austria, clinched the title with her belter Rise Like a Phoenix at the final in Denmark

One Twitter user seemed impressed that the comedian may be toted for the top job, claiming he would 'stay up late' to watch the Eurovision if Rusciano was appearing. 

Another user supported his stance saying: 'Attention Australia. There is only one woman for this job. You know it. I know it. Let's do this.'

A host of other hilarious names were added to the list of Twitter hashtags. Tweeters have been quick to suggest that Prince Philip may be the man to represent Australia, having controversially recently received a knighthood from Tony Abbott.

'Prince Philip is the obvious Australia entrant,' one Twitter user said, while another user backed him up claiming Prince Philip should be sent to the Eurovision as he is now an honorary Australian. 

Dame Edna Everage, Tim Minchen, Peta Credlin and Brendan Maclean's names have also been mentioned on social media, with many Australian's throwing their support behind their favourite contender for the job.

'If Dame Edna Everage does not represent Australia at Eurovision, there is no justice. She has the right level of musical talent,' one Twitter user said.  

Fans of Melbourne based band The Cat Empire have also begun their own online campaign in the hope the anonymous group will bring their hit The Wine Song to Europe. 

Others suggested that some of our most well-known actors could light up the stage and win the competition for Australia. 

Hollywood actor Russell Crowe has also been suggested online as a possible candidate for the international contest

Hollywood stars Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman have both appeared in musicals including Les Misérables and Oklahoma and according to social media users could be the very men for the job. 

'Hey Australia, you know there's only one choice for Eurovision: Hugh Jackman a Twitter user said. 

Australia has until March 16 to decide who will represent them at the show which has previously accepted entries from outside Europe but none from so far away.

A petition has also been launched to get Spinning Around pop superstar Kylie Minogue to represent her home country at the Eurovision song contest. 

And a campaign on change.org started by Ismael Gomez in Madrid, in Spain, shows support for Kylie has already begun.

Popular Australian band The Cat Empire are also contenders for the job

The Change.org campaign was set up by a TISM fan, who claims the band should represent Australia and show the Europeans what real Australian music sounds like 

Last year, Australian singer Jessica Mauboy was watched by 180 million people when she performed as a guest - but didn't compete- at  the Eurovision Song Contest in Denmark in 2014. 

A statement from SBS said 'The [new] deal is a result of SBS's ambition to increase Australia's presence at Eurovision following the success of Jessica Mauboy's performance last year in Denmark.'  

The petition states, 'It is the first time and the last one Australia will take to the stage and compete in the popular song contest as it marks its 60th anniversary. 

'Kylie is the symbol of that country, the best pop singer in the world and, for sure, the Spanish community will support her in Vienna next May.

Comedian and fan-favourite Em Rusciano has received her own hashtag on Twitter. #EmRuscianoForEurovision has set the Twitosphere alight 

'And, finally, because WE LOVE KYLIE!!!!' 

The petition, which has so far earned 25 signatures and messages of support, was sent to SBS, long associated with the contest. 

Australia's participation is a one-off initiative to mark the show's anniversary and organisers say that even if Australia wins, it will not host next year's contest, which will remain in Europe.

However, if they do win the title Australia will be allowed to defend their crown the following year.
