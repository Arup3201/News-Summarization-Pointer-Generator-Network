Leicester have made an enquiry for Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani.

The 26-year-old Algeria international, who has also attracted interest from West Ham, would set the club back around Â£7million.

The striker impressed for Algeria at the World Cup as they reached the last-16 - where they lost to eventual champions Germany.

Target: Leicester want Algeria striker Islam Slimani

Finisher: The forward scored 8 times in 26 league games for Sporting Lisbon last season

Slimani scored twice in World Cup Group H, firstly against South Korea in a 4-2 victory, then the equaliser against Russia in the 1-1 draw that sent them through to the second round for the first time in history.

He started 26 league games for Sporting last season, scoring eight goals in the process.

He would join the likes of David Nugent and Chris Wood as Leicester prepare for their first Premier League season in a decade.
