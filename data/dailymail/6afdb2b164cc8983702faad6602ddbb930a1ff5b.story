Elusive UK-based street artist Banksy is in the middle of a month-long stay in New York City, but says some of the places he's planned to do his art for months have quickly become too swanky for his tastes.

'[I] returned to find most of the empty lots I planned to use have got condos built on them already,' Banksy said in a rare interview with the Village Voice. He said he staked out the city months ago and was shocked at the speed of development.

'I chose it for the high foot traffic 
and the amount of hiding places,' he said. 'Maybe I should be somewhere more 
relevant, like Beijing or Moscow, but the pizza isn't as good.’

He speaks: Anonymous graffiti artist Banksy is in the middle of a month-long residency on the streets of New York City and recently gave a rare interview to the Village Voice

The famously private graffiti artist 
chose the New York City paper for his interview because he ‘feels an affinity with people who
provide quality content for free on street corners,’ though like 
everyone who’s tried to make contact with Banksy, the Voice discovered 
he’s not entirely forthcoming about his work.

Through
a UK publicist, Banksy discussed his work, his self-imposed anonymity, 
and his plans to create a new work on the streets of the Big Apple for 
every month in October.

‘I represent the artist Banksy,’ began an email to the Village Voice with the subject line ‘confidential.’ The alt weekly received the message in September from London art publicist Jo Brooks.

Brooks would be the facilitator between the Voice and Banksy, who keeps his identity hidden in part because of the illegal nature of his work.

Private: Unlike in his 2010 documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop (pictured), the Village Voice had no sit down interview with the artist. They conversed only through email

Most recently, that illegal work includes Better Out than In: An Artist Residency on the Streets of New York. The month long project began posting photographic evidence of Banksy’s work on the website BanksyNY.com starting October 1.

‘The
plan is to live here, react to things, see the sights—and paint on 
them,’ Banksy told the Village Voice in an email. ‘Some of it will be 
pretty elaborate, and some will just be a scrawl on a toilet wall.’

Starting October 1, Banksy has used his masterful stenciling technique to turn New York City buildings into his canvas.

Naughty paperboys, a dog peeing on a fire hydrant, and a Band-Aid covered balloon now decorate Manhattan and Brooklyn, or did until they were quickly painted over.

Rumors: Banksy addressed questions surrounding his pieces and quashed rumors that he, himself, destroys his work after the fact. Pictured is a piece from October 2 in Manhattan

Playful: Banksy says he must remain anonymous because of the illegal nature of his art. Here, Banksy's signature stenciling can be seen on a Manhattan wall from October 1

There was also an attempt to turn the
impatient graffiti of other spray painters into Broadway gold simply by
stenciling ‘The Musical’ beneath screeds like ‘Playground mob’ and 
‘Dirty underwear.’

In 
addition to his painted works, Banksy also created a mobile installation
of a garden, complete with rainbow and waterfall, in the back of a 
delivery truck.

Banksy told the Voice he visited New York ‘a couple of months ago’ to do reconnaissance for the October show, but declined to say how long he planned to stay as after attempting to do one piece of art every day in the city until October 31.

‘I started painting on the street because it was the only venue that would give me a show,’ he writes. ‘Now I have to keep painting on the street to prove to myself it wasn't a cynical plan. Plus it saves money on having to buy canvases.’

One of the questions posed to the graffiti artist who's also sold art to the likes of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt centered on profit:

'Does the artist stand to make a profit from his New York residency?'

'There's no way round it—commercial success is a mark of failure for a graffiti artist,' he writes. 'We're not supposed to be embraced in that way. When you look at how society rewards so many of the wrong people, it's hard not to view financial reimbursement as a badge of self-serving mediocrity.'

While Banksy chose not to answer many of the Village Voice’s questions—How many people can you trust?, Does the burden of all the cloak-and-dagger s**t ever seem like too much to carry?, How do we know this is really Banksy responding to these questions and not some Nigerian prince or a teenage hacker in the Syrian Electronic Army?—he did answer why he chose New York City for his one of a kind residency.

‘New York calls to graffiti writers like a dirty old lighthouse. We all want to prove ourselves here,’ Banksy wrote.

Banksy has created much of his work in New York to be themed on the city. 'New York calls to graffiti writers like a dirty old lighthouse,' he said
