Its pink coral sands have made it the pearl of the Italian coastline.  And now the paradise island of Budelli off the coast of Sardinia could soon be yours - for just £2million.

The tiny islet around a mile square is up for sale after its Milan-based owners went bankrupt.

The private island is set to be auctioned off to the highest bidder, and has now been valued at over £2million.

The Italian government has first refusal on the island, which is in a protected area 10 miles off the coast of Sardinia, where Silvio Berlusconi has a luxury villa.

As it is unlikely that the cash stricken Italian state will be able to raise the funding, the uninhabited slice of paradise looks likely to go to a rich foreign bidder, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.

The Italians are up in arms at the thought of the jewel of the Maddalena archipelago falling into foreign hands.

Last year Greece announced plans to lease some of its 6,000 islands to ease its financial woes.

Swathes of the northern coast of Sardinia, long the playground of rich and famous have recently been bought up by Qataris.

A media campaign to save Budelli has been launched to put pressure on the Italian department for the environment to save the heritage for the Italian people.

The island is covered with rich Mediterranean vegetation and is home to a variety of plants and wildlife.

It is completely private. Landing or dropping anchor within a hundred metres of its unique sands is completely forbidden keeping paparazzi at bay from any prospective celebrity buyer.

The only existing buildings are the caretaker's house, a postwar military structure, the ruins of a cabin and a dry stone wall along the beach.

The Spiaggia Rosa (Pink Beach) on the south-eastern side of the island owes its distinctive colour to microscopic fragments of corals and shells. 

Budelli was the backdrop for the 1960s film Deserto Rosso, Red Desert, starring a young Richard Harris opposite Sixties Italian screen siren Monica Vitti.

Politicians have been swift to wade into the debate. 

Sardinian regional president Ugo Cappellacci, called on the federal state to buy the island, saying it is 'a national treasure that should never be put up for sale'.

Stella Bianchi, of the PD Democratic Party: 'The island of Budelli can not be put up for auction and should as soon as possible return to being part of public property.'

The island is one of a group of three uninhabited islands originally populated in the 13th century by monastic hermits, who are thought to have used a network of underground tunnels to move between them.
