Accountant Caroline Puddu accidentally killed herself with an overdose in a bid to avoid court after being accused of stealing from former employers

An accountant killed herself accidentally after pretending to be a drug addict to avoid facing fraud charges in court, an inquest heard.

Caroline Puddu, 36, was accused of stealing £213,000 from her former employer.

But days before she was due to appear before magistrates, she died after overdosing on her diabetic mother’s insulin.

As part of her ruse, she had told doctors, social workers and psychiatrists repeatedly of attempts to kill herself by taking an overdose.

She also claimed she had taken her mother’s insulin and drank a bottle of wine and 20 cans of cider a night because of stress at work.

But her requests for rehabilitation were rejected by medics after tests found she was healthy. In fact, she did not take drugs and rarely drank, but went to the gym regularly and often did fun runs.

In a last-ditch attempt to avoid court and jail, Miss Puddu, from Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire, took insulin to make it look like she was an addict, the inquest heard. But she took too much and on April 17, 2013, died from hypoglycaemic brain death, in which the brain is starved of glucose.

Doctors told the hearing in Stoke the overdose caused severe brain damage that left Miss Puddu in a coma for ten days.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, North Staffordshire coroner Ian Smith said: ‘Her last employment led to problems and it all went very sour – it’s probable she committed criminal offences.

‘She made some very strange claims that she was taking significant amounts of alcohol and a huge amount of drugs that would have killed a horse, never mind her. She was trying to get into residential accommodation because that would have avoided some of the criminal proceedings. I think this was escapism to avoid reality.’

Miss Puddu – who lived with her mother Sheila Puddu, 77 – earned £38,000 as accountant for Fletcher Moorland in Stoke-on-Trent for four years before her death. Bosses found large amounts of money had gone missing and accused her of stealing £212,750 between October 19, 2008, and August 9, 2012.

But Mrs Puddu said her daughter was over-worked and bullied by the firm, adding: ‘Sometimes when she got home she would cry because she was so tired and then she would get calls through the night. She was owed that money for overtime and the extra hours she worked. She was terrified of going to jail. She just couldn’t see another way out.’

However, the firm’s managing director, Matt Fletcher, 41, insisted yesterday Miss Puddu had not been bullied, adding: ‘Money was stolen from us over four years. She was entrusted with the company’s money, she was the only person responsible for the accounts.’
