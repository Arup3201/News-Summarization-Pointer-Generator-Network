Royal Mail has refused to deliver to an entire housing estate after a dog attack on a postal worker.

The ban on 162 households on the Greenthorpe estate in Leeds, West Yorkshire, means residents face a two-mile round trip to a Royal Mail depot to collect their post in person.

People affected claim the ban is 'ridiculous' and the Royal Mail is overreacting.

Maria Lavery said: 'We've had no post for a month. It's annoying as we've not been told what is happening with no explanation from Royal Mail.

'We are fed up. My neighbour missed her birthday cards and couldn't get to collect them. I have a rottweiler which is kept under control and not allowed to roam free.'

Royal Mail have placed signs around the estate notifying people that they will not be getting mail, while residents say they are 'fed up' with the situation, which currently has no end in sight.

Diane Boolemiller said: 'My older neighbours have had to collect their post. We've been told so many different things by police, the dog warden, we just want answers.'

Local councillor Ann Blackburn said: 'It is a ridiculous situation and this can't go on.'

Felicity MacFarlane, of the Royal Mail, said: 'Royal Mail is now formally suspending deliveries and we will be writing to affected customers.

'We apologise for the inconvenience but our priority is the health and safety of staff. They should be allowed to deliver without fear of attack.'

The dog incident, believed to involve a roaming brindle terrier cross breed, understood to be from a house in the local area, is one of the 4,000 animal attacks on UK postal workers each year.

Royal Mail are now seeking assurances that the dog will be secure and not roaming free.

Postal workers are refusing to deliver to a housing estate because they fear tripping over crooked paving slabs, it emerged today.

Royal Mail deliveries to two Staffordshire streets have now been suspended for health and safety reasons.

It means dozens of families and elderly people in Penkull, Stoke-on-Trent, will now have to make a six-mile round trip to collect their post from a central depot.

Maryfield Walk and Rogerstone Avenue have been declared no-go zones after overzealous officials carried out a risk assessment and ruled the pavement was a 'significant' hazard

The two streets, Maryfield Walk and Rogerstone Avenue, have been declared no-go zones after being their pavements were deemed a 'significant' hazard following a health and safety assessment.

Residents, who have branded the ban 'health and safety gone mad', will now go without any postal deliveries from November 18 unless they pay for the repairs.

Andrew Morley, 54, has owned one of the flats on Rogerstone Avenue for 10 years.

He said: 'I think Royal Mail is going a bit over the top with their health and safety measures. People walk over those slabs every day and they don't fall over.'

Maryfield Walk resident Mavis Poulter, 73, added: 'I manage to walk over them without tripping over every morning - and I've got a dodgy hip.

'Some slabs are a bit uneven, but to say they are a hazard is just health and safety gone barking mad.

'I can't easily travel six miles just to pick up my post - it's going to take me four buses to get there and back. I've lived here 23 years and I've never known one person to ever fall over and injure themselves.'

The residents' properties were built around 28 years ago and the surrounding pavements have never been adopted.

Many of the homes are now rented to leave homeowners trying to track down the landlords to see if they will pay for the repairs.

The affected residents are being urged to check their property deeds or consult the Land Registry.

Local councillor Randolph Conteh added: 'I'm going to speak to Royal Mail about alternatives to the suspension.

'I'm concerned about ensuring there is some kind of service in place particularly for the older and more vulnerable residents.'

'The management company has written to the residents highlighting the problem areas and suggested they work with neighbours to resolve the problem.

'But really we need to all get around a table and come up with a solution together - even if that means a collection box is set up very close to the homes.'

In a letter to residents, Royal Mail delivery office manager, Jagdeep Bhela, said: 'I can confirm that the area continues to pose an increasing and significant risk to my staff.

'This combined with the worsening weather conditions means it is with regret I'm writing to inform you that unless remedial repairs are completed by November 16, deliveries to your address will be suspended with effect from Monday November 18.

'In order for me to consider reinstating daily deliveries the paving slabs, grids along the walk ways, access to stairs and repairs to a number of handrails require remedial attention.'
