Asda could face legal action from thousands of its shop workers amid claims that it pays female staff less than men.

The action is being brought by checkout workers – predominantly women – who feel their roles are not considered of ‘equivalent value’ to those of higher paid, male-dominated jobs in warehouses.

Law firm Leigh Day is pitching the case as one of inequality under equal pay legislation. 

Female checkout workers may launch a legal case against their employers amid claims male-dominated jobs in warehouses are valued more highly by the company than theirs 

It hopes to sign up 10,000 of Asda’s 165,000 workers in a class action. What’s at stake is a difference of up to £4-an-hour – a sizeable amount for those working close to the minimum wage.

The law firm is trying to draw similarities with the Ford strike of 1968 when women sewing machinists walked out of a factory in Dagenham after being told their jobs were to be reclassified as less-skilled than those of men working on the production line.

At Asda, staff in the distribution centre are 80 per cent men – the checkouts are 60 per cent women.

Asda claims that the skills required for the roles are different; warehouse workers need to be trained in how to use a forklift truck and health and safety regulations.

A spokesman for the supermarket said it was proud of its record in anti-discrimination which it will defend robustly if necessary 

Both men and women on the checkouts are part of the class action. They claim their roles require the same level of skill.

A spokesman for Asda said: ‘We do not discriminate and are very proud of our record in this area, which, if it comes to it, we will robustly defend.’
