'Plain Janes' are often happier at school than the girls who seem most popular and attractive, according to an academic.

Sociable and successful pupils often have the worst problems, says Professor Carrie Paechter, from Goldsmiths College in London.

Girls further down 'the pecking order' are under less pressure to be perfect and to conform, the education professor will tell headteachers at a conference next week.

'There is a lot of pressure to be top of
the social group, but often girls who are popular aren’t well liked - they’re feared because they’re dominant,' she writes in a speech to be given at the Girls’ Schools Association annual conference in Liverpool.

Although popular pupils may appear to be part of tight-knit friendship groups, girls who are part of these cliques often turn on each other, as is demonstrated in high school films such as Mean Girls.

'One group we studied at a school was
very dominant and they kept constant surveillance on each other, 
checking they had their socks rolled down in the exact way and that 
their hair was done properly,' said Professor Paechter, according to The Times.

'There was pressure to be beautiful all the time 
or you were letting the group down. One of the girls was whispered about 
because her ponytail wasn’t how it should be, and it took her all day to
realise what was wrong, then she was mortified.

'Girls further 
down the pecking order don’t notice how their socks should be.

Grounded: Prof Carrie Paechter, left, says girls should not worry about looks all the time, while Girls' Schools Association president Helen Wright, right, said the idea that popular girls were more respected was 'a myth'

'If you’re
being picked on that’s awful, but if you’re just ordinary you can have a
decent time at school, keeping out of it.'

Superstar Julia Roberts last year admitted that she was not popular in high school.

The Oscar-winning actress told Access
Hollywood Live: '[I was] just mediocre, just getting through the 
hallways with my girlfriend Paige.

'We weren't losers, but we weren't popular, we were just coasting, that is exactly what we were doing.'

Charlize Theron also revealed that she wasn't in the 'in crowd' at school.

The Oscar-winning South African actress - who was a muse for John Galliano and has modelled for Christian Dior - told Collider: 'I was pretty much a mess out of primary school. I wasn't really in the popular crowd.

'I wore really nerdy glasses. I was blind as could be, and boys don't really like big nerdy glasses.

'There was a really popular girl at my school, and I was obsessed with her... I'm so embarrassed to say this, but I was in tears one day, because I couldn't sit next to her.'

Prof Paechter told Mail Online: 'I was bullied at school at times, but at others times I wasn't one of those people who would modify my uniform to look cool.

'Because my friends and i weren't cool, the whole aspect of how you look just wasn't important to us.

'We found once school in particular in which there was a group of 10- and 11-year-olds who described themselves as the "Mean Girls".

'There was constant observation of who you were talking to, what you looked like.

'It was so easy to get excluded - one girl came in to school and was told she had failed the "friendship test". She had no idea what that was.

'On another occasion a teacher found some sellotape stuck deeply into a girl's hair. She said she could tell from the look on that pupil's face that she was wondering, "who put that there?".''

Helen Wright, president of the Girls' Schools Association, told Mail Online that allowing cliques to 'go unchecked' meant 'setting girl against girl in the wider community.

'People have this myth that people in these high profile groups are more respected.

'They look at celebrities as the ideal. We believe it is important to ground people and teach them to value themselves.'

The terms of a cliquey friendship group can change overnight, explains the professor.

The
girls who seem most socially successful can therefore be most at risk 
of developing emotional or psychological problems, and teachers should 
react quickly to signs of issues.

Professor
Paechter's research appears to undermine the idea espoused by famous 
teenage films including Clueless, She's All That or Carrie that 
unpopular pupils are the unhappiest.

In middle-class families, she said, it’s not just 
about doing well at school but about being all-rounders.

There is often also pressure to excel at sport, music as well as being top of the class.

Schools emphasise that to stand out from the 
crowd they must be exemplary human beings as well as doing well 
at GCSEs and A levels.

Professor Paechter said schools need to support success while 
reducing what can seem to be a constant pressure to be the best.

Pupils should be encouraged to become aspirational without being 
perfectionists.
