It's not often that a king comes face-to-face with an emperor but that is exactly what happened when the Netherland's King Willem-Alexander was welcomed to Japan by the country's Emperor Akhito.

The Dutch royals are beginning a six-day tour of the country, and were greeted by an honour guard as they arrived in the Japanese capital.

After a visit to a design museum and a gorgeous oriental garden, the two finished their first day with a lavish state banquet thrown in their honour.

But despite the best efforts of the two monarchs, it was Queen Maxima who commanded most of the attention - courtesy of a chic silk dress and hat in patriotic orange, and later, a glittering gold gown.

Also on hand to welcome the Dutch monarch and his wife was Empress Michiko, 80, who, when she married Emperor Akhito on the 10th April 1959, became the first commoner ever to marry into the Japanese royal family.

After exchanging handshakes on the red carpet, Akhito, 80, joined his Dutch counterparts for a flag raising ceremony and official public welcome.

Japan boasts the oldest continual hereditary monarchy in the world, beginning with Emperor Jimmu who reigned from 660 BC.

Since then, 125 emperors have come and gone, with the most recent, Hirohito, famous for being head of state during the Second World War.

Unlike other members of the Japanese administration, he was not charged with war crimes and instead oversaw Japan's rebirth as a constitutional monarchy - a process continued by his son, Akhito. 

Unlike their Japanese counterparts, who have sat on the Chrysanthemum Throne since 1990 following the death of Emperor Hirohito, the Dutch royals are among the newest - and youngest - monarchs in the world.

Willem-Alexander, 47, was one of the beneficiaries of a spate of abdications in 2013 which saw his mother Queen Beatrix step down along with King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI.

Only Felipe and Letizia of Spain have been on the throne for a shorter period of time, with the two crowned in June following the abdication of King Juan-Carlos. 

But while Letizia and Felipe's reign has so far gone smoothly, Maxima and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks in part to the MH17 tragedy, which left the Netherlands reeling.

Nevertheless, since the crash, the popularity of the Argentina-born Dutch Queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families.

She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil.

Salute: During the ceremony, the royal flags of both countries were raised by the guard of honour

Stylish: Maxima pulled out all the stops for her meeting with Empress Michiko and opted for patriotic orange

High-powered: During the meeting, Willem-Alexander spoke to his Japanese counterpart, Emperor Akhito

Tour: After the meeting with the Japanese royals, the Dutch couple were taken to a design museum

More recently, the Dutch royals have found themselves cheered to the rafters during public appearances, most notably when they appeared on the balcony of the Noordeinde Palace in the Hague on Prinsjesdag [Prince's Day], along with the former Queen Beatrix, 76

Maxima, 43, has also become a familiar sight at charity events around the Netherlands, with her most recent outing being at a symposium organised by women's rights activists in Amsterdam, which celebrated the 40th birthday of a Dutch law banning domestic violence.

With her husband, she also enjoyed a successful trip to New York last month, where she was seen chatting with fellow queen Letizia during a meeting of the UN General Assembly.

The pair were reiunited for the second time in a month two weeks ago, when the Spanish royals paid their Dutch counterparts a friendly visit in The Hague. 

Entertaining: The couple appeared to enjoy their time at the museum, Maxima in particular

What's this? The pair look baffled as they inspect a series of jars containing a mysterious-looking substance

Curious: Maxima looked slightly horrified as the jars contents were explained to her by museum guides

Beautiful: After the visit to the museum, the couple enjoyed a quiet walk around its pretty garden

Quiet: Maxima, who was clutching a bouquet, and Willem-Alexander made their exit across a bridge
