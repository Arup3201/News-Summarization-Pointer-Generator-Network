BT Sport caused outrage after cutting to adverts while Newcastle manager Alan Pardew and captain Fabricio Coloccini were laying wreaths on the seats of the two fans that died in the MH17 disaster.

Producers only cut back to the Newcastle vs Sydney FC match - following five adverts for other brands and one for their own - for half of the minute’s silence for John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28, who were killed while en route to New Zealand for the game.

Twitter erupted with angry viewers, who described BT Sport's coverage of Newcastle's 4-0 win as 'a complete disgrace'.

In memory: The programme cut to adverts as Pardew and Coloccini walked up the stand in tribute

The programme cut to adverts as Pardew and Coloccini were walking up the stand at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin to place the tributes to the fans.

This was followed by adverts for Birds Eye, SEAT, Strongbow, McDonald’s and Expedia - as well as a promotional clip for the channel’s coverage of Arsenal vs Manchester City next month.

Newcastle fan Ryan Brooks said on Twitter: 'BT Sport, (I) think it's awful and disrespectful you cut to adverts as they were laying wreaths in the stands - poor, poor on your front.'

Season ticket holder Daniel Goodall added: 'BT Sport - well done on cutting to adverts when flowers were getting placed, and managing to miss the majority of the minute’s silence. Disgrace.’

Bill Grieves also said: ‘BT Sport - 
would have been nice to have shown the full silence for the two 
Newcastle fans rather than adverts. Fail.’

Flowers: The tribute from Pardew and Coloccini came before Newcastle beat Sydney 4-0 in New Zealand

A BT Sport spokesman told Sportsmail that the channel was sorry for what happened, saying: ‘We apologise for 
any upset caused by a mistimed break during the Newcastle game.

‘The timing was unintentional, and we will show the tributes and the minute’s silence in full at the end of the game, as well as put all the footage online.’

This was later welcomed by Newcastle fans, with 'Yorkshire Sam' saying on Twitter: 'Good that BT Sport replayed the minute's silence at the end. They should never have cut to the adverts in the first place.'

The channel later posted on tweet linking a video of coverage of the tribute on its website.

Newcastle strolled to a 4-0 victory against Sydney FC on Tuesday as Pardew's new signings were given the chance to impress in New Zealand.

Siem de Jong gave the Magpies an early lead as the Dutchman pounced on a mistake from Sydney goalkeeper Ivan Necevski, before new boy Emmanuel Riviere scored on his non-competitive Newcastle debut.

Pardew earlier insisted the forthcoming season would be dedicated to the two fans who died on the Malaysia Airlines flight. He said: ‘None of us would be sitting here without the fans.

‘Owners and managers come and go, as do players, but the fans are always there, and these two guys in particular, to go to the lengths that they did to get out here, has brought home just how important supporters are to us.

‘Sometimes when you lose lives in that
 manner, it puts into context what we do. This season we want to give 
their families something to remember them by, by having a successful 
season.’

Pardew also thanked
 the Sunderland fans who raised more than £23,000.

‘A 
lot is made of the rivalry between the two cities, and of course that is
 there,’ he said.

‘But I 
would like to thank all the Sunderland fans who have paid tribute and 
helped raise a staggering amount already.

'I am very proud of Sunderland 
Football Club for the way they have conducted themselves and I want to 
thank them.’
