A woman was asked to leave a McDonald's in Wisconsin after bringing her pet baby kangaroo into the restaurant. 

Diana Moyer carried 'Jimmy', who was wrapped in a blanket and tucked in an infant car seat, into the fast food chain last Friday morning. 

Police Chief John Kreuziger  said a patron phoned citing safety concerns because the animal was inside the hamburger chain.

Jimmy was wrapped in a blanket and tucked in an infant car seat as he was carried into McDonald's last Friday morning, according to police (one of the Moyers' pet kangaroos above)

Beaver Dam police officer Rich Dahl said a patron called police citing safety concerns because the animal was inside of the hamburger chain (above)

When Beaver Dam police officer Rich Dahl arrived at the scene following the anonymous 11.41am call, Diana explained Jimmy was a service animal to help her cope with emotional distress, and she produced a letter from a doctor. 

She eventually agreed to leave the restaurant and was not given a ticket, but she did receive a warning.

Chief Kreuziger said the caller felt it was not appropriate or safe for the kangaroo to be in the restaurant, according to Wisc News.

Diana's husband, Larry, (above) said that Jimmy serves as a therapy pet to his wife while she battles cancer

The Beaver Dam Police Department said it has previously had calls about the Moyers and the exotic animals that they own (above the Moyers' pets at their farm in Columbus)

Wanda Haltek, said: 'We are aware a customer called the authorities regarding this incident who then investigated and took the steps to resolve the situation. 

'Our policy is to make our restaurants accessible to all customers, including those with disabilities and special needs, in compliance with all laws and regulations. 

'At McDonald's, we strive to provide a great restaurant experience for every customer.'

However, Diana and her husband Larry do not believe she did anything wrong.

Jimmy is the youngest of five kangaroos they have owned for nearly five years, and he is often brought out in public, according to WISN.

Larry said that Jimmy serves as a therapy pet for his wife while she battles cancer.

They also said their pets do not pose a threat to anyone. 

The Beaver Dam Police Department said it has previously had calls about the Moyers and the exotic animals that they own, but the animals have been relocated out of the city to avoid problems.

The couple have a farm in Columbus, where they look after many different animals, according to WTMJ.

McDonald's issued a statement and said its policy is to make its restaurants accessible to all customers, including those with disabilities and special needs.
