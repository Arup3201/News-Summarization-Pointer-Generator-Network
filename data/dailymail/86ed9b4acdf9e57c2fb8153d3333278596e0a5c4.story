The senior bankers who brought Britain to the edge of financial collapse will enjoy pension nest eggs totalling more than £100million.

The biggest winners are receiving – or will receive when they retire – gold-plated pensions worth at least £300,000 a year, with one landing a massive £1.4million.

By comparison, the average private sector worker does not even have a company pension. The basic state pension is worth a maximum of just £5,600 a year.

An investigation looked at the directors of the five banks – Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, HBOS (owner of Halifax), Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley – which were bailed out by the taxpayer following the credit crunch.

The total transfer value of pensions for the 23 executive directors on the boards of the five banks when they failed is a total £107million.

Lord Oakeshott, a leading Liberal Democrat peer, said: ‘Irresponsible bankers will enjoy these vast fruits of failures for the rest of their lives.

‘That really sticks in the throats of hundreds of thousands of people who lost their jobs or businesses, and millions whose pensions were savaged by the banking crash.’

The research, by The Times, added in one extra director – Sir James Crosby, the former chief executive of HBOS, who left in 2006 after aggressively expanding the bank.

Among the big winners is Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, who was later stripped of his knighthood.

He was entitled to an annual pension of £703,000, but eventually volunteered to cut it to £342,500 a year after a public outcry.

His former rival, Adam Applegarth at Northern Rock, which was the first bank to collapse in the financial crisis, will get £305,000 a year.

John Mann, a Labour MP who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘The banks have not got the message at all.

‘They
presume that one way or the other they will get away with their role 
[in the crisis]. And these pensions demonstrate that, in a way, they 
have got away with it.’

Other
winners include Peter Cummings, the former HBOS banker,  who was given a
£500,000 fine and a lifetime ban by the City regulator in September for
his role in the banking crisis.

Mr
Cummings, who gets a pension worth £369,000 a year, insists his 
treatment by the Financial Services Authority was ‘tokenism at its  most
sinister’.

The biggest beneficiary is Larry Fish, who ran Royal Bank of Scotland’s US operations Citizens before its collapse, who gets a pension of £1.4million a year.

Gail Cartmail, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, said: ‘These bankers failed the nation  and they failed their staff – they  are the real undeserving being allowed to walk away with gold-plated pensions.

‘When you look at these eye-watering payments, it is astonishing that Unite is having to campaign for a living wage for the lowest paid staff at these banks.’
