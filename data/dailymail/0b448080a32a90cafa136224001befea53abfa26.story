After a grim and heart-breaking funeral farewell for murdered schoolgirl Masa Vukotic on Thursday, friends and loved ones chose to celebrate her life with laughter, colour and style.

The Queen Victoria Gardens in Melbourne were lit up by over 500 people dressed in pink and frills, donning bunny ears, bows and carrying bright balloons during 'Princess Marci's Royal Parade' on Saturday afternoon.

Petar and Nadja Vukotic, Masa's brother and sister, also attended the event where they released 17 white doves for the 17-year-old.

However mourners used the parade as a way to remember the 'loving', 'charismatic and hilarious young woman' whose love for the colour pink, Lolita Japanese fashion and Cosplay - the practice of dressing up as a character- was well known.

'This event is really us celebrating who Marci was, because as much as she would have loved for us to mourn for her, she also would have wanted us to come together and become stronger from this,' Melanie Givord, the event organiser, told The Age.

The 16-year-old said Masa supported raising awareness about violence against women, adding that her death 'could have been prevented'.

'If this had of happened to someone else, she would have been so angry about it and she would have made sure everybody knew about it,' she said.

'Marci had a passion for animal rights and for her pet rabbit Roger, and would always love to share with the world how adorable her little bunny was.'

A funeral for the 17-year-old stabbing victim was held two days earlier at Springvale Botanical Cemetery.

'Marci had a passion for animal rights and for her pet rabbit Roger, and would always love to share with the world how adorable her little bunny was,' a notice for the event stated 

This event is really us celebrating who Marci was, because as much as she would have loved for us to mourn for her, she also would have wanted us to come together and become stronger from this,' Melanie Givord, the event organiser said

Ms Givord described Masa as a feminist who would have wanted to raise awareness about violence against women

The bright colours and lighter atmosphere were a stark contrast tot the emotional funeral held for Masa on Thursday

'I never got to tell Masa just how important she was to me although I know in my heart she knew how much I loved her,' Nadja said.

'Darling Masa, I love you so much and that will never change. You may be gone but you will never be forgotten.'

During the packed service, Slabvoljub Vukotic, wearing a pink pocket handkerchief, promised his daughter the family would try to be brave in the days and weeks to come. 

'We will try to be as brave and courageous as you were....I promise I will come to you one day but until then my heart bleeds for you,' Mr Vukotic said.

Masa's mother Natasa then managed to take to the podium to make a heart-felt promise to her daughter.

'From the first moment I looked into your eyes, you were my most precious Masa. I know this is not our final goodbye. I will race to you with open arms and say to you 'come to your mum'.'

'With every sunrise and every sunset you will be in my soul and you will be in my heart.'

'I will love you as I always have…. I will always think pink.'

Her school friends, many who wearing pink ribbons in their hair and arms, created a sea of pink flowers outside the chapel.

Masa, a student at Canterbury Girls Secondary College, was stabbed to death as she walked near her Doncaster home in Melbourne's east last Tuesday night

While Masa's life was much too short, life is not measured by the number of breaths you take but by the number of breaths that take your breath away.

Masa had many breath-taking moments in her life. She was born on December 1 1997. Since birth she was bursting with life, vitality and passion.

She was 17, sparking, outgoing, funny, intelligent and simply one of a kind.

Masa loved life and was eager to embrace all it had to offer. As a perfectionist she excelled in everything she did but she especially love reading, travelling and spending time with her family and friends.

The devastated family of murdered Melbourne teenager Masa Vukotic have issued a deeply moving statement about losing their 'ambitious, passionate' daughter and sister

She loved to dance and perform. She loved Cosplay. For those of you who don't know what that is Cosplay is a performance art where costumes and fashion accessories represent a specific character or idea.

Masa had more costumes and accessories than anyone. She used to take her mum shopping and she'd always buy another dress to take home and add to her collection.

Masa also had an unrivalled love for fashion which she said she developed as a baby as a result of her mum changing her outfit three or four times a day to take baby photos.

On a recent trip to Paris and Montenegro she managed to pack, among many other things, four heavy winter coats so she wouldn't be photographed in the same one.

Her room is all pink with her collection of costumes, quirky posters and so on.

She had skill to take selfies like no other and she was indeed the princess of selfies.

She made many many friends in her short life. Masa loved her sister Nadja and brother Petar dearly. She shared a special bond with them both and that is a bond that only family who are close with siblings share.

You'd hear Masa and Nadja talking together, performing various roles in front of the camera.

Masa and her mother were very close. They laughed together and often debated together. Masa always seemed to win the debate.

Masa wanted to become a lawyer and dreamed of enjoying drinking lattes in a range of different outfits.

Masa was an inspiration to many. Her motivation and drive were exceptional and would have been an outstanding wife. She used to go on walks with her father which would usually end up in some make-up store.

The family would like to express their gratitude for the love and support they received from their family and friends and community at large. A particular thank you to Victoria Police.

Masa touched all our hearts. Even if you do not know her personally. We miss her beautiful smile, her funny little mannerisms and the sparkle in her eyes. Masa we love you, you will be in our hearts forever.
