Three care home bosses have been charged with manslaughter following the death of an 86-year-old woman, who died two weeks after the property was shut down by inspectors.

Ivy Atkin died in November 2012, a fortnight after she was moved from Autumn Grange Care Home in Sherwood Rise, Nottingham, into another care home. 

A police investigation had been launched after concerns were raised about the standard of care provided to residents at the home, which specialised in dementia care.

Owners Naseen Kiani, 53, and Yousaf Khan, 46, and 38-year-old operations manager Mohammed Rahamatullah Khan have now been charged with gross negligence manslaughter.

A fourth person, care worker Safeena Bibi, 26, of Nottingham, has been charged with Health and Safety at Work Act offences.

The company which owned the home, Sherwood Rise Ltd, has been charged with corporate manslaughter.

Five other people who were on bail in connection with the death have been released with no further action.

Kiani, from Sheffield, and Yousef Khan and Mohammed Rahamatullah Khan, both from Nottingham, will appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on April 14, alongside Bibi and the company secretary of Sherwood Rise Ltd. 

Before it was closed down, Autumn Grange had room for 52 people aged over 65.

The four defendants will appear at Nottingham Crown Court, alongside a representative of Sherwood Rise, the company which owned the home 

Inspectors from health watchdog the Care Quality Commission investigated the home prior to it closing in November 2012. 

The report found ‘multiple examples of neglectful care’ at her care home.

At the time, 28 residents had to be immediately rehoused in other accommodation. 

Mrs Atkin, a widowed former dressmaker, had been moved to Autumn Grange in the summer of 2012 when she became unable to cope in the bungalow where she had lived for more than 50 years.

According to a relative, Mrs Atkin, who was suffering from dementia, had worked as a factory machinist.

Her husband of 58 years, Kenneth, worked in a lemonade factory before his death six years ago. The couple had no children.
