A youthful yet chilling voice  belonging to a nine-year-old boy calls for the reclamation of Islamic authority around the world.

His father, who proudly shared the video on social media, is a devout supporter of  Hizb-ut-Tahrir - the controversial Muslim group which organised protests in western Sydney last week against 'government aggression'.

In the footage, seen by Daily Mail Australia, the child  stands before a Sydney gathering to deliver a sermon about sacrifice and victory of the Muslims.

The boy addresses his fellow 'brothers and sisters' as he chants passages from the Koran and preaches in his Australian accent.

A video of the nine-year-old preaching to his 'brothers and sisters' in Sydney has been posted by his father

Another video shows the boy, 7, in 2012 addressing protesters at a rally in Sydney

'Today we see the same sacrifices in the Muslims and the mujaheens in Syria and Afghanistan and in Palestine and all around the Muslim lands who know that only Islam can bring mercy to mankind,' the boy preaches.

'Let us take this opportunity, in this month (Ramadan) … by sacrificing everything for the sake of Allah.

'Let us pray that Allah will release the calamities to this Ummah and brings back Islam as an authority and as life to be an example to the humanity and send mercy to mankind.' 

His father, who Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to identify, posted the footage on Facebook in July - during Ramadan - which was then shared a number of times.

More videos of the boy delivering a sermon were posted by his father on Facebook in 2013

The father of the boy is a supporter of controversial Muslim group Hizb-ut-Tahrir

His father, who also shows his support for Hizb-ut-Tahrir online, has also posted similar videos of the boy in previous years.

The child stood before a Sydney protest in support of the Syrian uprisings in 2012, at the age of seven, where he delivered another speech.

'We witness that our brothers and sisters in Syria, in Afghanistan, in Palestine and other countries has been oppressed by corrupt tyrant rulers,' the boy said.

'They sacrifice their lives and they sacrifice their families for the sake of Allah. May Allah help our Ummah to work day and night to establish the (caliphate) that will protect and free all Muslims from oppression.'

On the father's Facebook page, disturbing images of soldiers brandishing Islamic flags  and children holding machine guns  can be seen.

He also posted an image which declares: 'Say no to democracy.'

It also appears he attended a Sydney rally organised by Hizb-ut-Tahrir last Thursday night, following a series of pre-dawn anti-terrorism raids -  the largest counter-terrorism operation in Australian history.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the nine-year-old boy's father for comment. 

The operation last week saw 800 police officers carry out 25 search warrants across Sydney's north-west and in three Brisbane suburbs. 

About 200 protesters took to the streets to defend their rights as Islamic Australians in Lakemba, western Sydney, with signs reading 'terror raids cannot break the spirit of Muslims' and 'stop terrorising Muslims'.

In August, a shocking photo of a young boy holding a head of a decapitated soldier in Syria emerged on social media when it was posted by his father and convicted Australian terrorist, Khaled Sharrouf. 

It was accompanied by a photo of Sharrouf himself holding the same head, written with the words: 'What a head', and another of him and three young boys brandishing rifles. 

Since departing Australia, Sharrouf has been using his social media pages to boast about the Islamic State group.

Sharrouf is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for alleged terrorist activities in the Middle East after he fled the country in December on his brother's passport.
