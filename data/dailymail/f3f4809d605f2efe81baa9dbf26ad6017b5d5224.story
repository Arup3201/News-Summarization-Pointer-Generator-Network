A Hawaiian beauty queen has revealed she was also victim to the Manti Te'o fake girlfriend scam.

Tessi Tolutau, crowned Miss South Pacific in 2007, told the New York Post yesterday that the make-believe Lennay Kekua contacted her on Facebook in 2008.

Tolutau said 'Kekua' claimed she was dating Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez, was a Victoria's Secret model and wanted her advice on entering beauty pageants.

Conned? Beauty queen Tessi Tolutau claims she was also fooled into thinking 'Lennay Kekau', the fake girlfriend of Manti Te'o was real

Denial: Notre Dame star Manti Te'o denied he had anything to do with the hoax on Friday. He says he was the victim of an elaborate false identity scam

'She wrote, ‘I just wanted to know 
what path I should take for the Miss Tonga pageant,’ ' Tolutau told the 
Post. 'We went back and forth. I gave her advice about how to prepare. 
It was an ongoing conversation . . . She even asked me about [other 
Hawaiians I knew] and about Manti, too.'

'We would chat back and forth. She 
explained to me that she played basketball at Stanford, that she was a 
Victoria’s Secret model, that she was dating somebody from Stanford. She
even said she was dating [Jets quarterback] Mark Sanchez.'

The
Kekua fabrication came to light Wednesday, when Deadspin.com revealed 
that the story of Te'o's girlfriend dying from leukemia last September 
was a fake -- because Lennay Kekua never existed.

Deadspin
suggested Ronaiah Tuiasosopo was involved in carrying 
out the hoax. Te'o said Friday he had been contacted by the 22-year-old 
Tuiasosopo and that he admitted to masterminding the scam.

In an interview with ESPN on Friday, Te'o broke his silence to deny he had played any part in perpetrating it - claiming he was simply the victim of the elaborate scam which took place over four years before Kekua's supposed death on December 6.

He admitted it was 'crazy' that he had a purely online relationship with a girl but denied he was part of the con to gain publicity for his burgeoning football career at the college.

Defense: Tessi Tolutau, a beauty queen, who grew up near Manti Te'o says he couldn't have been in on Kekua hoax. She says she also shared messages with the made-up Stanford student

Exposed: Manti Te'o's 'dead girlfriend' Lennay Kekau was exposed as an elaborate hoax. A woman's pictures were used for the scam she also played no part in

'No. Never,' Te'o said in an interview Friday night with ESPN's Jeremy Schaap, 'I wasn't faking it. I wasn't part of this.'

Tolutau hails from the same town as 
Te'o and says her 'stomach dropped' when she discovered Kekua wasn't real. 

She also met for lunch with Ronaiah Tuiasosopo on the advice of 'Kekua'.

'When I was in LA, Lennay told me I should go to this Polynesian-dance practice with her cousin, Ronaiah,' she continued.

'Manti wasn't in on this,' she also told ESPN. 'He checked with a lot of us about her. I believed she was real. We all did.'

According to the Post report Te'o's cousin was also hoaxed in 2008.

The unnamed cousin, also a football player, would speak to her on the phone sporadically after a friend put them on a call together.

Flowers: Records show Manti Te'o sent flowers to this home at 21503 Water St., Los Angeles, California, where he thought Kekua lived. She didn't live there, but alleged hoaxster RonaiahTuiasosopo did

Address: A Kekua family lives at 21403 Water Street, in Los Angeles, California. However, nobody lives there called Lennay Kekua

Tolutau
came forward as reports revealed Tuiasosopo's connection to an address 
that received two dozen white roses from Manti Te'o he says he believed 
he was sending to his dead girlfriend's address.

According
to an Associated Press report, the flowers were sent to 21503 Water 
Street, Los Angeles, where Tuiasosopo's family lived in a single-story 
bungalow.

A family with the surname Kekua also lives six doors down although say they have never heard of a 'Lennay Kekua'.

Neighbors told the AP on Saturday that Ronaiah 
Tuiasosopo had lived at 21503 Water St. and has visited it since moving 
out about a year ago.

In
specifying where he had sent the roses, Te'o said Friday in an 
interview with ESPN that he still didn't know who lives at 21503 Water 
Street or of any possible connection between the address and the hoax.

But he did say he knew the residents had accepted delivery of the bouquet.

'They sent me a picture of the roses,
of them getting it,' he said.

Publicly available records indicate that Tuiasosopo used to live at 21503 Water Street.

One neighbor said Saturday that Ronaiah had lived in the house for several years, until about a year ago.

Deadspin first reported on Wednesday that Lennay Kekua's existence was a hoax, allegedly played by Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, a family friend

Another neighbor said that in her 27 
years living on the block there had always been a Tuiasosopo living in 
21503, including Ronaiah, his father and an uncle, Navy.

Multiple public records indicate that
Navy, who played football for Utah State and the Los Angeles Rams, was a
brother of former USC football player Titus Tuiasosopo, Ronaiah's 
father.

A neighbor said Navy had lived at 21503 until his death in 2011.

A Cadillac still registered to Navy 
Tuiasosopo was parked in the driveway of Titus Tuiasosopo's home in 
Palmdale, about 90 miles north of Carson, on Saturday.

Titus is the pastor of Oasis 
Christian Church of the Antelope Valley in Lancaster, Calif., and 
Ronaiah is active in the church band, and most recently has been living 
with his father.
