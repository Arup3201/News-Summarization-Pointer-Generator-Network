Impeccable style isn't something you'd necessarily associate with someone who crunches numbers for a living - let alone a man living in 16th century northern Europe.

However, long before Kim Kardashian turned selfie taking into an art form, German accountant Matthaeus Schwarz was busy piecing together the world's first fashion book.

In an incredible project that appears to be unique, style-obsessed Matthaeus - who was born in Augsburg, Germany, in 1497 - commissioned 137 watercolour paintings of himself over a 40 year period.

Matthaeus Schwartz commissioned pictures of his flamboyant outfits over a 40 year period from the 1520s

The German accountant kept a note of when he wore each look - just as today's bloggers do

Fascinated by clothes, the flamboyant dresser began recording his appearance on parchment paper in 1520, during a time when strict laws governed the kinds of fabrics each social rank and station could wear.

He initially commissioned 35 images to document his sartorial choices from childhood up to his early 20s but ended up with 101 more pictures.

The extraordinary undertaking ended up spanning over 40 years and only ceased when Matthaeus reached the age of 63. 

As no other pictorial record like this exists, historians believe Matthaeus created the first ever fashion tome - similar to 21st century online blogs.

Unlike today's fashion bloggers, Matthaeus, who spent a large part of his income on clothing, didn't have Instagram filters and Photoshop to rely on. 

He opted for surprisingly elaborate outfits which were an example of cutting-edge fashion of the time and used his clothes to make a political statement. 

He bound all his outfit paintings into a volume called the Book Of Clothes

Matthaeus donned a red and yellow outfit (echoing the colours of the Holy Roman Emperor’s flag) when Charles V returned to Germany, as a show of his allegiance to Catholicism.

After amassing an extensive collection of paintings, the fashion innovator had the pages bound and made into the ultimate vanity project, a volume titled Book of Clothes.

Among the portraits are pictures of him  in festive clothing for the Emperor Maximilian I's visit to Augsburg in 1518, dressed up for a rich banker's wedding in 1527, and in mourning garb for his father's death in 1519.

He added comments to each of the images explaining when the outfit was worn along with his Latin motto omne quare suum quiam - every because has a why.

Now the tome has inspired a new set of photographs of fictional male dandies by artist and photographer Maisie Broadhead.

Maisie, alongside her fashion designer sister Bella Newell and Professor Ulinka Rublack, has created five modern photographic recreations - printed to large scale - telling the fictional story of Matthew Smith, a young man from north London, who is obsessed with clothes.

The modern photographs are based upon images commissioned between 1520 and 1560 by Matthaeus.

 A Young Man's Progress is a free exhibition held at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. It runs from Tuesday 24 March until Sunday 6 September.

Artist Maisie Broadhead was inspired by Matthaeus Schwarz's life work to create a series of pictures portraying a modern dandy for an exhibition called A Young Man's Progress

Some of the illustrations captured Matthaeus in everyday activities, like opening a door
