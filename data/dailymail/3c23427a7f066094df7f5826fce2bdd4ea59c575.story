Former England football captain John Terry has been banned for four matches after the Football Association has found him guilty of racial abuse.

The 31-year-old Chelsea captain had denied an FA charge that he racially abused Anton Ferdinand in a Premier League match last October. He was acquitted in a criminal case in July.

But following an FA independent regulatory commission hearing, he has now been banned for four matches 
and given a £220,000 fine for using insulting words which included a 
reference to Anton Ferdinand's colour or race.

The verdict comes just days after Terry sensationally retired from international football and his position as England captain.

Guilty: John Terry is pictured arriving at Wembley Stadium today where he was banned from four matches and fined £220,000

Terry retired just hours before the FA hearing 
was expected to begin. He claimed the FA made his position ‘untenable’ over the well-known incident and that the 
decision 'breaks my heart'.

After four days hearing evidence, from Terry, Ferdinand and other 
witnesses, the independent panel handed down their verdict this 
afternoon.

The fine he has been forced to pay is 
the equivalent of the footballer working fewer than 10 days based on his 
current £150,000-a-week deal at Chelsea.

A statement from the FA said: 'An Independent Regulatory Commission has 
today found a charge of misconduct against John Terry proven and has 
issued a suspension for a period of four matches and a fine of £220,000,
pending appeal.

'The Football Association charged Mr Terry on Friday 27th July, 2012, 
with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards 
Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand and which included a reference to 
colour and/or race contrary to FA Rule E3[2] in relation to the Queens 
Park Rangers FC versus Chelsea FC fixture at Loftus Road on October 
23rd, 2011.

'The charge was the result of The FA's long-standing investigation into 
this matter, which was placed on hold at the request of the Crown 
Prosecution Service and Mr Terry's representatives pending the outcome 
of the criminal trial.

'The decision of the Independent Regulatory Commission is as follows: Mr
Terry be suspended from all domestic club football until such time as 
Chelsea's First Team have completed four competitive matches, and fined 
the sum of £220,000.

'The penalty is suspended until after the outcome of any appeal, or the 
time for appealing expires, or should Mr Terry decide not to appeal. The
reason for this is to ensure that the penalty does not take effect 
before any appeal so that Mr Terry has an effective right of appeal.'

Earlier Terry left Wembley after two-and-a-half hours in his silver 
Porsche, followed shortly after by his legal team clutching boxes of 
paperwork and a suitcase, who piled into a waiting taxi without making a
comment on the verdict.

Barring any appeal, the verdict brings the 11 month controversy to an 
end after Terry allegedly called the QPR player, who is Terry's former 
England colleague Rio Ferdinand's younger brother, a "f****** black 
c***" during a Premier League clash at Loftus Road.

Banned: A four-man panel has heard evidence from both Terry and Anton Ferdinand, as well as supportive testimony from Ashley Cole, Ray Wilkins, Fabio Capello and his assistant when he was England manager, Franco Baldini

Terry was cleared of a a criminal charge of racially aggravated public 
order offence at Westminster Magistrates' Court in July, but the FA 
brought disciplinary charges under its own rules - he was charged with 
using 'abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour, which included a
reference to ethnic origin and/or -colour and/or race'.

He will have 14 days to appeal against the verdict - meaning that the 
affair could drag on deep into next month - and the FA could also appeal
if it was unhappy with the verdict.

If Terry does not appeal Chelsea's next four matches from which he will 
banned are are Arsenal away on Saturday, Norwich City at home, Tottenham
Hotspur away and Manchester United at home, but he could still play in 
the Champions League for his club.

The four-man panel has heard evidence from both Terry and Anton 
Ferdinand, as well as supportive testimony from Ashley Cole, Ray 
Wilkins, Fabio Capello and his assistant when he was England manager, 
Franco Baldini.

Both Italians provided character references for the 
former England captain.

Terry's barrister, George Carter-Stephenson QC, initially argued that 
the FA case should be thrown out because the player had been cleared of 
criminal charges this year.

Mr Carter-Stephenson argued that the FA's own rules prevented cases from
being heard by the governing body if they had previously been dealt 
with by a court of law.
