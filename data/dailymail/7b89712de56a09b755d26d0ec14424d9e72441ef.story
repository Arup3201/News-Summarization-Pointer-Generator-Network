A toddler who was born with no face is being given the chance to live a normal life thanks to the help of the same  surgeon who separated Bangladeshi-born conjoined twins Trishna and Krishna.

Three-year-old Yahya El Jabaly was born with no eyes, a hole in the middle of his face where his nose should be and no upper jaw.

The Moroccan born toddler, who lives in a small village six hours from Casablanca, was born deformed after complications in the womb stopped the bones in his face from fusing together.

Despite his incredibly rare condition, Yahya managed to survive and grow into a happy and healthy toddler through the support of his adoring mother and father.

However socially, he is automatically an outcast as his appearance is considered too confronting for many.

The toddler's face is covered up whenever he leaves his small village and, due to lacking the roof of his mouth, he is unable to speak and can only communicate through grunts.

Yahya's plight first went global when the father of his closest friend took to Facebook, pleading for medical professionals to help the boy lead a normal life.

'I just want my child to look as normal as possible so he can go outside and play with the other kids,' his father said

From across the world, the post was read by Fatima Baraka, a Melbourne breast cancer survivor who was born in a village close to Yahya's.

'He's entered my heart...I'm so in love with this little boy,' Ms Baraka told Channel Seven's Sunday Night.

'There was a big phone number in red [on the post], it was quite obvious that it was a cry for help of some sort and I found myself reaching for the phone and calling the number.

'He [Yahya's father] said "I just want my child to look as normal as possible so he can go outside and play with the other kids".' 

Fatima Baraka, a Melbourne breast cancer survivor, heard of his story on Facebook and took it upon herself to help Yahya by flying him to Australia 

'There was a big phone number in red, it was quite obvious that it was a cry for help of some sort and I found myself reaching for the phone and calling the number,' Ms Baraka said of the message which was posted by Yahya's neighbour

Ms Baraka took it upon herself to search for a surgeon who would be willing to transform Yahya's face and soon found Melbourne reconstructive surgeon, Tony Holmes who separated Bangladeshi-born conjoined twins Trishna and Krishna.

She then travelled to Yahya's home where she met the toddler and his family for the first time before bringing them to Australia.

'I was quite shocked. I didn't think I would be shocked but I was,' Ms Baraka said of her first meeting with the family.

'I was a little bit horrified to be honest.' 

Dr Tony Holmes, who separated Bangladeshi-born twins Trishna and Krishna, will operate on Yahya in December

He completed a range of tests on Yahya in Melbourne, including CT and MRI scans, to see if he was suitable for surgery

Yahya and his parents also met Dr Holmes after being flown to Melbourne where the three-year-old underwent a range of developmental tests from CT scans to MRI's, to confirm how his brain functions and if he was suitable for surgery. 

Despite the serious risks involved, Dr Holmes soon agreed to operate on the toddler. 

'He may not die if we don't operate on him, but he might if we do,' Dr Holmes told Channel Seven's Sunday Night.

The operation will bring the two sides of Yahya's skull together and shape him a nose from his own skin

'I believe that it’s the right of everybody to look human and this kid doesn't look human,' Dr Holmes said

'I believe that it’s the right of everybody to look human and this kid doesn't look human.'

Yahya will undergo surgery in December, when Dr Holmes plans to bring the two sides of his skull together and build him a nose with his own skin. There is also a chance that the toddler will be able to speak after the procedure due to his vocal chords remaining intact.

'We're not experimenting on him, we want to get a good result,' Dr Holmes said.
