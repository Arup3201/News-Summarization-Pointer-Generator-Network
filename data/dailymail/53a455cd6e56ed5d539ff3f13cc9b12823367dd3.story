Fifteen out of 50 payday lenders have quit rather than prove their business practices are up to scratch, after a watchdog ordered them to show that they act responsibly.

The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said that 14 of the lenders have told it that they are leaving the payday market and another firm which failed to meet the deadline has said it is no longer operating as a lender.

The watchdog has been carrying out a probe into 'deep-rooted' problems within the industry, such as lenders encouraging struggling borrowers to roll over loans they cannot afford so that the debt balloons.

The OFT is investigating 'deep-rooted' problems within the industry, such as lenders encouraging struggling borrowers to roll over loans they cannot afford so that the debt balloons

Last month it referred the sector for a full-blown investigation by the Competition Commission.

A 12-week cut-off point set by the OFT for 50 lenders, which account for 90 per cent of the market, to show they are acting responsibly has now passed for all firms.

The OFT said that of the 14 lenders who are leaving the payday industry, three have surrendered their licences completely.

The other 11 continue to operate in other areas where they still need a consumer credit licence to trade, such as pawnbroking or debt collection, for example.

The watchdog is going through reports provided by 46 firms in total, including the 11 firms who are pulling out of the payday market but still need to have a consumer credit licence.

Vince Cable said the OFT's action 'clearly shows that tough enforcement is having a real effect'

These reports, which have been compiled by independent auditors, must demonstrate to the OFT that lenders are complying with the rules and have put right particular concerns it has raised.

They must prove, for example, that firms have removed any misleading advertising, that they are being clear with consumers about the terms of the loan up-front and that they are carrying out proper affordability checks.

The watchdog identified areas of concern with each of the 50 firms and in some cases it sent them annexes of up to 70 pages long.

If the OFT still has concerns after going through the responses it has a range of powers such as stopping firms in their tracks immediately or choosing to inspect them again.

David Fisher, OFT senior director for consumer credit, said: 'We are evaluating the audit reports sent in by payday lenders and will announce any further action in due course.

'Should any lenders fail to demonstrate they are fully compliant we have several options open to us to protect consumers, including suspending or revoking their licences.'

Business Secretary Vince Cable said the OFT's action 'clearly shows that tough enforcement is having a real effect'.

He said: 'Clearly there is more work to be done. I look to the remaining 35 lenders to take action to fix the problems in their own practices, or face up to further sanctions by regulators.'

Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which? said: 'People are increasingly turning to high cost credit just to pay for essentials or repay other debts, so it is vital that the Government and regulators continue get tougher on irresponsible lenders.'

Russell Hamblin-Boone, chief executive of the Consumer Finance Association, which represents short-term lenders, said: 'We have consistently called for those lenders who don't, won't or simply can't meet the standards set by responsible payday lenders, to either shape up or ship out.

'All CFA members have responded positively to the OFT and await its response.'
