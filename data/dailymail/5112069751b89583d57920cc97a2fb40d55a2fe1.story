Neymar could soon have the world at his feet if he inspires Brazil to glory on home turf this summer. 

And the Barcelona star got a taste of the ball he hopes to win the World Cup with during training at Brazil's training base on Wednesday.

Chelsea's Oscar and former team-mate David Luiz were among the players who used the Brazuca ball while training alongside Neymar as the squad were assembled on the pitch for the first time since joining up for the World Cup.

Goalkeeper Julio Cesar has backed the official World Cup ball, playing down possible worries over the performance of the adidas-made Brazuca. 

'The ball is a good one, we had contact with it today,' the former Inter Milan and Queens Park Rangers player said of the Brazuca, which is a playfully slang word for native Brazilians.

'I think the outfield players are going to like it too,' he added.

His comments at Brazil's Granja Comary training complex, which is in Teresopolis 90km outside Rio de Janeiro, were in sharp contrast to four years ago when he and other players criticised the Jabulani ball, which was used in the South Africa World Cup.

That ball, he said, was too light and moved about in the air. It was 'terrible, horrible, like a ball you buy in the supermarket,' he added.

Julio Cesar had a miserable campaign at the 2010 finals where his mistake contributed to Brazil's elimination by the Netherlands at the quarter-final stage.

But the 34-year-old, who is now plying his trade with FC Toronto in U.S. Major League Soccer, said he had worked hard to recover his confidence after that career low point.

'Sometimes too much confidence can trip you up, and I say that from experience,' he said.

'After the World Cup, in addition to our elimination, I had problems with Inter and with Queens Park Rangers. I had to be very strong in order to be here today.

'I am a much better player than four years ago,' he said. 'Although I had the rank of best goalkeeper in the world in 2010 I feel like I am much better prepared today. You always have to take something positive from adversity.'

What a way to travel: Brazil's method of transport during the World Cup has been revealed

Perfect branding: Brazilian airline Gol has provided the Boeing 737-800 for the national team's travel

Scolari's planning has been meticulous and this was evident when his squad arrived.

The stars had a medical check-up at Granja Comary, dubbed the Brazil Lab.

Luiz, on the verge of a £50m move from Chelsea to PSG, had his mouth and ears checked up, while his soon-to-be club-mate Thiago Silva got the same treatment as the squad were put through stringent fitness tests.

Meanwhile, the team's method of transport has been revealed for the World Cup: a spectacular painted airplane branded with the team badge. 

The plane, a Boeing 737-800 provided by Brazilian airline Gol - was painted by The Twins, graffiti artists and identical twin brothers Otavio and Gustavo Pandolfo.

Their design features faces that represent the Brazilian people.
