Eddie Howe has been awarded the Championship Manager of the Month after Bournemouth's startling rise to the top of the second tier. 

The Cherries won all four of their league games - while also dumping West Brom out of the Capital One Cup - in October. 

Howe's side have won nine of their last 10 games in all competitions. That's thanks in now small part to striker Callum Wilson, who picked up the Player of the Month gong.

Preston North End boss Simon Grayson picked up the League One Manager of the Month prize 

The 21-year-old, who moved from Coventry in the summer, scored six in five throughout last month. 

Sky Sports' Football League pundit Don Goodman said: 'Eddie Howe has built an extremely talented young side on the South Coast and The Cherries are in an impressive run of form.

'Dan Gosling, Junior Stanislas and Adam Smith are seizing the fresh chances that Howe has given them and summer-signing Callum Wilson is repaying the faith shown in him with plenty of goals.'

Simon Grayson's Preston - who missed out on promotion last season in the play-offs - sit five points behind League One leaders Bristol City. 

But the Lilywhites' form, five wins from five, has seen their boss clinch the top prize. 

They have, however, lost their first two games in November.
