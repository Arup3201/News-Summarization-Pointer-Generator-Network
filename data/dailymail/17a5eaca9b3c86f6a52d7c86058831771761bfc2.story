Men and women across the world are living six years longer than they did a generation ago. 

A major new analysis - the Global Burden of Disease study - today revealed men are living 5.8 years longer than they did in 1990, while women are living an extra 6.6 years.  

Falling death rates from cancer (by 15 per cent) and heart disease (down 22 per cent) in high-income regions have fuelled the rising life expectancy in these parts of the world.

Meanwhile in lower-income countries, rapidly falling death rates for diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infections (conditions that affect the lungs, such as pneumonia) and neonatal disorders have helped prolong life expectancy.

The top 50 causes of global years of life lost in 1990 and 2013, according to new Global Burden of Disease study. Men are living 5.8 years longer than they did in 1990, while women are living an extra 6.6 years. Falling death rates from cancer and heart disease in high-income regions have fuelled the rising life expectancy in these parts of the world. Meanwhile in lower-income countries, rapidly falling death rates for diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infections, and neonatal disorders have helped prolong life expectancy

But as life expectancies are increasing throughout the world, there is one notable exception.  

In southern sub-Saharan Africa deaths from HIV and AIDS have wiped more than five years off life expectancy.

While worldwide deaths from HIV/AIDS have declined substantially every year since its peak in 2005, the conditions are still the greatest cause of premature death in 20 of 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the study found.

The top ten leading causes of premature death worldwide have hardly changed since 1990. Nine causes remained in the top ten in 2013, with HIV/AIDS moving in and tuberculosis moving to 11th.

Worldwide, since 1990, years of life lost due to HIV/AIDS have increased by 344 per cent, drug disorders by 119 per cent, chronic kidney disease by 90 per cent, and Alzheimer's disease by 89 per cent.

And the study, reported in The Lancet medical journal, cites war as being the leading cause of premature death in Syria, where an estimated 30,000 people died in 2013. A further 30,000 were killed in the preceding two years.

In high-income regions, life expectancy had mostly been increased by falling cancer and heart disease death rates, said the report.

There have also been dramatic increases in life expectancy in some low-income countries, experts found. In Nepal, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Niger, the Maldives, Timor-Leste and Iran, life expectancy increased by more than 12 years in the last two decades.

Certain causes of death were shown to have increased around the world since 1990. 

They included liver cancer, drug use conditions, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes and pancreatic cancer, the study in The Lancet medical journal found. 

Despite dramatic drops in child deaths over the last 23 years (from 7.6 million in 1990 to 3.7 million in 2013), lower respiratory tract infections, malaria, and diarrhoeal disease are still in the top five global causes of death in children younger than five years.

They continue to kill almost two million children between the ages of one and five every year.

Men in the UK increased their life expectancy by the average, rising from 72.9 to 79.1 years between 1990 and 2013. But UK women saw only a 4.4-year increase from 78.4 to 82.8 years.

In eastern Europe, half of all premature deaths in 2013 were due to five causes: heart disease, stroke, self harm, cirrhosis, and road injury.

Meanwhile half of the word's suicide deaths occurring in India and China alone.

In India, life expectancy at birth increased from 57.3 years to 64.2 years for men between 1990 and 2013 and 58.2 years to 68.5 years for women during the same time period. India has made remarkable progress in reducing child and adult deaths with death rates dropping 1.3 per cent per year for adults and 3.7 per cent for children.· 

Road injury and  interpersonal violence - violence between people who know each other - are key contributors to premature deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean, ranking in the top five leading causes for 17 and 15 out of 29 countries in the region, respectively.

Outside this region, interpersonal violence only ranks in the top five causes in just one other country in the world: South Africa.

Lead author Dr Christopher Murray, professor of global health at the University of Washington, US, said: 'The progress we are seeing against a variety of illnesses and injuries is good, even remarkable, but we can and must do even better.

'The huge increase in collective action and funding given to the major infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, measles, tuberculosis, HIV/Aids, and malaria has had a real impact. 

'However, this study shows that some major chronic diseases have been largely neglected but are rising in importance, particularly drug disorders, liver cirrhosis, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.'
