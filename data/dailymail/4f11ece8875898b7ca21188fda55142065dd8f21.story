Arizona State offensive lineman Edward Sarafin has become the first active Division I college football player to come out as gay

Arizona State offensive lineman Edward Sarafin has become the first active Division I college football player to come out as gay.

A fifth-year senior, Sarafin told Phoenix-based Compete, a magazine for gay sports, that he began telling team mates about his sexual orientation last spring. 

'It was really personal to me, and it benefited my peace of mind greatly,' he said in the magazine's August issue.

The walk-on lineman, who goes by the nickname Chip, follows the precedent set by St. Louis Rams linebacker Michael Sam. Sam told team mates he was gay during his playing days, but did not come out publicly until after finishing his career at Missouri. 

Arizona State coach Todd Graham said: 'We are a brotherhood that is not defined by cultural and personal differences, but rather an individual's commitment to the Sun Devil Way.

'Chip is a fifth-year senior and a Scholar Baller, a graduate and a masters student. His commitment to service is unmatched and it is clear he is on his way to leading a successful life after his playing career, a goal that I have for every student-athlete. 

'Diversity and acceptance are two of the pillars of our programme, and he has full support from his team mates and the coaching staff.'

Arizona State athletic director Ray Anderson added: 'The entire athletics department is extremely proud of Chip and is unequivocally supportive of him.'

Massachusetts sophomore Derrick Gordon became the first active openly-gay Division I basketball player when he came out in April.

Brooklyn Nets forward Jason Collins became the first active openly-gay player in one of the four major U.S. professional sports leagues when he came out to Sports Illustrated in April 2013. He became the first openly-gay player to play in an NBA game after signing with the Nets last season.

Numerous other athletes have come out as gay the past couple of years, opening the door for players like Sarafin to do it without so much fear of repercussions from team mates or coaches.

The 6-foot-6, 320-pound lineman from Gilbert, Arizona,  graduated with a degree in biomedical engineering last spring and is currently in Arizona State's masters programme. He has yet to play in a game, working as a scout-team player early in his career and providing depth on the Sun Devils' offensive line last season.

Sarafin has been involved in research for football-related concussions and has been active in the community with youth sports and the Tillman Scholars programme. 

He has received support from Michael Sam, who tweeted: 'Congratulations Chip Sarafin for having the courage to be yourself. Wishing you and your teammates much success this season. #courage2014'.
