Single parents finding a job have taken the number of working families in Britain to a record high.

New figures today showed 87.3 per cent of families have at least one person earning in work, the highest since records began almost two decades ago.

Ministers claimed the data was proof that welfare reforms are ensuring that people will always be better off in a job than claiming benefits.

Compared to 2008, the biggest rise has been among lone parent families finding work, the Office for National Statistics said

The government insists that efforts to tackle so-called troubled families, where no-one works, have helped to tackle long-term unemployment.

The Office for National Statistics found that 87.3 per cent of families were classified as working families, the highest since comparable records began in 1996.

The biggest increase was among lone parent families with dependent children up from 57.4 per cent in 1996 to 71.1 per cent this year.

In the 2million workless families, more than half (53.8 per cent) have had no one in work for three or more years.

More than one in 10 children (12.6 per cent) were living in workless families, also the lowest percentage since records began in 1996.

Thera er now almost 14million working families in the country, up from 12million in 1996, the figures show

Parents of children under five were almost twice as likely to be in employment if they were in a couple (78.6 per cent) than if they were lone parents (40.9 per cent), the ONS said.

Employment of single mothers was also at a high, hitting 62.3 per cent this year.

Women were more likely to be in work if they had children than if they did not. Almost 70 per cent of women with dependent children have a job, compared to 67.5 per cent of women without children.

Young mothers aged 16 to 24 were around half as likely to be in employment (36 per cent) as mothers aged 25 to 64 (71.6 per cent) in 2014.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the Government's welfare reforms were encouraging more people to work.

He said: 'The benefits system this Government inherited was broken, often trapping the very people it was designed to help in cycles of worklessness and welfare dependency.

'We are reforming the system so that people are given the skills as well as the opportunities to get into work, with Universal Credit meaning that they can take employment safe in the knowledge that they will be better off than they would be on benefits.

'And our reforms are clearly working - with figures released today confirming that the proportion of families where no-one works is now at an all-time low. Furthermore, lone parent families have seen the biggest increases in employment rates and lone mothers now have the highest employment rate on record.

'As part of our long-term economic plan, we’ll be continuing to help people to break free from welfare dependency so they can look forward to a better more secure future for themselves and their families.'
