A British Playboy model  who was diagnosed with brain cancer last year says she has now become a shy introvert after surgery to remove the tumour.

Kerri Parker, 30, used to spend her time partying at Hugh Hefner's Playboy mansion in LA, drinking with A-list stars including Leonardo Di Caprio, and was once a body-double for Megan Fox.

But now she says she would rather spend time on her sofa with a cup of tea after surgery to remove a cancerous tumour left her with a 'personality transplant'.

Kerri Parker, 30, was a lab technician but in 2003 became a model after winning a competition. However following surgery to remove a brain tumour, she says she has now become a 'wallflower'

In an interview with the Sunday People, she said: 'At first it was small things but soon I noticed bigger changes. I thought it would be a good idea for me to get back into modelling but when I tried I just felt above it all.

'It's bizarre. I used to be the heart and soul of the party and now I'm a wallflower. I've swapped my skimpy dresses for comfy trackies.'

Miss Parker grew up in Norwich where she was a straight-A student, and studied at the University of East London before becoming a lab technician at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

However, all that changed in 2003 after she entered herself into a modelling competition in FHM magazine and made it to the finals.

She left her job to compete in national beauty pageants, and was picked up by the likes of lads magazine Max Power and U.S. swimwear brand Starwear.

She also appeared in American FHM, Maxim and American Playboy, starred in films such as Lesbian Vampire Killers, The Bourne Ultimatum, Batman: The Dark Knight and was a body-double for Megan Fox on the set of How to Lose Friends and Alienate People.

In 2012 she became an official Playmate and moved to the Playboy mansion in LA, spending time between there and the UK where she owns one of the UK's largest modelling agencies.

However, last November she was diagnosed with a brain tumour aged 29 following a holiday to Egypt.

At the time she told the Eastern Daily Press: 'I had been feeling unwell for about a year and have been getting worse and worse.

'When I got back from Egypt this week I had a really bad headache and was feeling sick. I couldn’t look at bright lights and I ended up being rushed into A&E.'

In February she had surgery on her frontal lobe, the part of the brain that controls memory and personality, including spontaneity,  impulse control, and social and sexual behavior.

While the surgery was a complete success with no physical side-effects, Miss Parker says she now struggles to come to terms with her new personality.

She told the People that  she has lost friends because of the extreme change, which even affects what types of food she finds appealing.

She added that she is trying to remain positive and is taking steps to try and reverse the personality change, but does not know how long it will take.
