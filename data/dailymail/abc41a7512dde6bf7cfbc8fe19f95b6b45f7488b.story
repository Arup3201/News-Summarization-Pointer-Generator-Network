A pregnant fourteen-year-old girl secretly delivered her baby with a pair of scissors in the family bathroom before throttling the boy to death and hiding the body in a shoe box.

Cassidy Goodison, 14, has been charged as an adult with first degree murder after police learned how she killed her child following months of fearfully disguising her pregnancy from her mother and father.

Her harrowing case has shocked even experienced officers and graphically illustrates the problems of the 750,000 teenage Americans who fall pregnant every year.

Goodison went into labor in her home in Greenbrier Village, Florida on September 19 and instead of calling for help, disguised her screams of pain by running the tap and gripping a towel between her teeth as she sat on the toilet.

Child killer: Cassidy Goodson, 14, is facing charges of first degree murder after she secretly gave birth to a baby boy, strangled him to death and then hid hid body in a pile of wet laundry

After prising the 9.5lb boy form her 
body with a pair of  scissors, she felt for a pulse and then strangled the boy 
to death and hid his corpse in a shoe box with dirty laundry.

Three
 days later, as Teresa Goodson cleaned her daughter's room, a foul odour
 drew her attention to a pile of soiled, wet clothes in which she found 
the deceased infant hidden in a box.

An autopsy performed determined the victim was a full term infant and that he was alive and breathing prior to death. He died as a result of asphyxia from strangulation and blunt force trauma.

Miss Goodson had gone to great lengths to hide the transformation of her 5ft 3in 100lb body during pregnancy, according to Polk County officials.

Throughout the summer, as she walked around in baggy sweat pant and loose-fitting T-shirts.

Members of her family grew suspicious of her appearance and attempted to discuss the possibility she was pregnant with the teen's mother.

But Mrs Goodson denied the suggestions,  said the report, claiming that she had made her daughter do two home tests, albeit in the privacy of her bathroom, which both came out negative.

Husband Timothy Goodson agreed meanwhile that he had noticed Miss Goodson's weight gain and that she had been walking around at home wrapped in a blanket. 

An interview with the teenager on September 22 revealed that after the 14-year-old had delivered the 9.5lb, 20.4in boy into the toilet, she had felt for a pulse and then strangled him to death.

Confirming he was dead by once again checking his pulse, she then cleaned herself and the baby and tucked the evidence out of sight.

Shortly after, however, Mrs Goodson noticed blood in the toilet she knew had been recently used by her daughter so took her to Lakeland Regional Medical Center.

There medical staff treating the high school student told Mrs Goodson that she had suffered a miscarriage and showed four to five lacerations on her vaginal wall.

Though these injuries were in reality self-inflicted when the teenager had pried the baby out of her with a pair of scissors, she falsely confessed to her mother that she had indeed had a miscarriage at home and flushed the fetus down the toilet by mistake. 

Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies, along with members of the Department of Children and Families responded to a call from the hospital reporting the case and details were retained by the PCSO Bureau of Criminal Investigations for follow up investigations.

'This is the most perplexing, confusing, disheartening case I've ever seen in my 18 years on this job'

According to the Sheriff's Office affidavit, on the evening of September 22, at approximately 7.30pm, Mrs Goodson removed a bag of smelly, wet clothing from a storage stool in her daughter's bedroom.

While sorting through the clothing she found the body of the baby concealed in the shoe box.

In a panic, Mrs Goodson called her sisters who in turn alerted the police.

Miss Goodson told detectives she was motivated to hide her pregnancy and choke the baby 'to stop him from breathing,' by the fear that her relationship with her parents would change if they found out the truth.

Miss Goodson was arrested on Thursday and transported first to the Juvenile Assessment Center and then to the Polk County Juvenile Detention Facility.

She is charged with Premeditated First Degree Murder, a capital felony and Aggravated Child Abuse, a first degree felony.

Polk County Public Information officer, Donna Wood, told MailOnline: This is the most perplexing, confusing, disheartening case I've ever seen in my 18 years on this job. Everyone has been touched by it.'
