Chelsy Davy's love life has been subject to speculation recently following rumours her boyfriend, society jeweller Charles Goode, was set to pop the question.

So it's no wonder her friends are keen to catch up with her to discover if she really is soon to become a Mrs.

The former long-term girlfriend of Prince Harry was spotted confiding in a friend as they met for lunch in London's Notting Hill.

No ring: Chelsy's engagement finger was bare as she met a friend for lunch

Chelsy, 28, has publicly denied she's engaged. Last month she told the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare: 'It's absolute rubbish - I'm definitely not engaged or even ready to get married.'

True to her word, she did not have a ring on her engagement finger when she was spotted eating out today.

Dressed casually in ripped black trousers and a faux fur animal print gillet, she wore her long blonde hair loose around her shoulders.

As she shared a cigarette with her friend before their lunch arrived, Chelsy's face was animated in conversation.

She could have been filling her friend in on her holiday to Africa at the start of September, where it was thought Charles, 30, would go down on one knee.

But as they are not yet to make their relationship more serious, some of her royalist fans hope she may one day rekindle her romance with the prince, 30. 

Solicitor Chelsy and Prince Harry had a seven year on-and-off relationship which saw the Zimbabwean beauty join him at many official events.

However the couple called time on their relationship in 2011.

According to friends, she decided she couldn't permanently live the life of a royal - particularly after seeing the intense public scrutiny the Duchess of Cambridge has been under since she became engaged to Prince William.

The couple remain good friends though and are reported to keep in touch regularly by phone, while their paths also frequently cross at the society weddings of friends they share.

While Chelsy has moved on to have a relationship with Charles, the prince had also found love again with Cressida Bonas. 

However, as with his experience with Chelsy, the pair have also had an on-off relationship. The couple were said to have split up in April but remain good friends.
