Australian state and territory governments have chosen not to grant a Monday public holiday when Anzac Day falls on a Saturday in 2015 - with the exception of Western Australia.

According to the official public holiday schedule for next year listed on the Australian Government's website, only WA will take an extra day to commemorate next year's Anzac Day centenary.

The granting of 'replacement' days for when public holidays fall on a weekend is at the discretion of state and territory governments and differs from year to year.

The Victorian Government says it's more important to commemorate the true meaning of Anzac Day than it is to have an extra day off.

'The purpose of Anzac Day is to respect, commemorate and remember the brave soldiers who sacrificed so much for our freedoms,' Small Business Minister Russell Northe told AAP.

'It is not about getting a day off and taking for granted the liberties our soldiers fought so bravely to protect.'

Mr Northe said Anzac Day trading restrictions would apply no matter which day April 25 fell on.

In 2009, Anzac Day fell on a Saturday and there was no public holiday, but the next year, when April 25 fell on a Sunday, Victorians got a Monday public holiday.
