Louis van Gaal admitted on Tuesday that it may take big-money summer signing Angel di Maria one year to adapt to life at Manchester United.

The former Real Madrid midfielder has suffered a severe slump in form after a bright start to life at Old Trafford and was even hooked at half-time by the United boss against Sunderland last week.

Sportsmail's man in Madrid Pete Jenson, who kept a close eye on Di Maria during his four-year spell in the Spanish capital, assures United fans the £60million man will come good.

When it comes to putting his medals on the table Angel di Maria has the silverware to silence the critics. He also has the references to convince Manchester United supporters that his current dip in form will soon pass.

Jose Mourinho signed him; Carlo Anclelotti stuck by him; Sir Alex Ferguson handed him his man of the match award after the 2014 Champions League final; and Real Madrid team-mates all knew he would be missed when he left the club last summer.

Xabi Alonso tweeted when he was sold: ‘Thanks for everything. I wish you all the best, even if you are going to United. We will never forget the zig-zag in extra-time in Lisbon.’

That message refers to the run and shot that led to Gareth Bale putting Real Madrid ahead against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final. It was the perfect end to his best season at a club where he was also instrumental in winning a Spanish Cup under Ancelotti and the league and another Spanish Cup under Mourinho.

The midfielder had a particularly bad afternoon against Sunderland last week before being hooked 

It should be remembered that his glorious last campaign also came with a mid-season glitch. He famously grabbed his crotch in a disrespectful snub to Ancelotti and the booing Bernabeu after being substituted during a game at the start of the year.

There was pressure on the coach to put Gareth Bale on the right wing ahead of the Argentine and feeling he was being edged out of the side unfairly in spite of a good start to the season he reacted.

Ancelotti did not ostracise him as many demanded, instead he reinvented him. Moving him from the right of Real’s front three to the left of their midfield three, there he became La Liga’s top assist provider. He played 22 passes leading to goals last season including one that helped win the Spanish Cup and one that helped secure the Champions League.

It is that willingness and versatility that first attracted Mourinho and he made him one of his first signings at Real Madrid for £20m from Benfica. The signing was not an outright success as Barcelona continued to dominate in Spain.

Di Maria played in the first Pep Guardiola v Mourinho clasico in November 2010 and was as culpable as any of his team-mates as Madrid went down 5-0 in one of the worst humiliations of the Portuguese manager's career.

But Di Maria never stopped going in that first season and the following March at Mestalla in the Spanish Cup final, also against Barcelona, it was a lung-busting run from Di Maria in minute 103 and a cross to the back post headed in by Cristiano Ronaldo that gave Mourinho his first trophy in Spain. The following year Di Maria helped his boss win the league.

The midfiedler also scored against Everton and all three of his league goals were scored by early October

Mourinho’s judgement is rarely off and the same can be said for Ancelotti's. He knew not to discard Di Maria just because Bale had arrived, channelling his qualities for the good of the team. Real are missing him now. Last season Luka Modric and Di Maria protected Real full backs Marcelo and Dani Carvajal leaving Bale and Ronaldo to concentrate on the business of terrorising opposition defences. 

This year with the Argentine sold and Modric injured they are, by their own standards, struggling with Ronaldo and particularly Bale, criticised for not working back in defence.

A first-season dip after a brilliant start is also nothing new for a player in his first season in the Premier League. Mesut Ozil suffered the same at Arsenal after his high-profile move from Real Madrid and Di Maria has more excuses than most to have dropped his performances levels.

He played 52 of Real Madrid’s 60 games last season and then played a big part in Argentina’s World Cup campaign. He might have foreseen a more relaxing season this time but he had to move his family to Manchester from Madrid in the summer and has the added stress of a further temporary move into a hotel after the recent attempted burglary at his Cheshire home.

That and Van Gaal’s failure to find the magic formula on the pitch and his preference for a more patient passing game has not helped the 27-year-old’s cause. His anarchic road-runner raids forward are a poor fit for the tactical straight-jacket Van Gaal occasionally imposes on his players.

Being hooked at half-time against Sunderland does not look good on Di Maria’s resume but alongside his Olympic Gold medal (scoring the winner in the final) his Champions League medal and the glowing references from Mourinho and Ancelotti, there is more than enough to remind everyone that while his current form is off, his class will eventually shine through.
