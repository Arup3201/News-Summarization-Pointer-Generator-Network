Google is close to signing a lease in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood for their first flagship U.S. storefront, according to reports.

Crain's New York reported the tech giant is interested in a 4,100 square-foot space at 131 Greene St next to high-end fashion retailers such as Stella McCartney and Tiffany, and about a block away from Apple's store.

Until now, Google has sold some products directly to customers inside retailers such as Best Buy, and briefly at some American airports.

9TO5GOOGLE reported Google hopes to have the first flagship Google Stores open for the holidays in major metropolitan areas, with the aim of getting new Google Nexus, Chrome and upcoming products into the hands of prospective customers.

The company will be following the lead of competitors Apple and Microsoft which have retail stores allowing customers to experience products before they buy them.

9TO5GOOGLE reported that Google has Chrome Store-within-a-store models in hundreds of Best Buys in the U.S. and 50 PCWorld/Dixon’s in the U.K., in which Google-trained employees specifically promote Chromebooks.

Google also ran a limited test run of Kiosks in five major American airports, including in San Francisco.

Sources told 9TO5GOOGLE that the decision to open stores came when drawing up plans to take the Google Glass to the public. Executives believed consumers would want to try the product before buying.

It is not clear if Google will sell any products at its floating barge that was built in San Francisco Bay.

While the asking rent has not been disclosed, brokers say Greene St's rising popularity with well-heeled shoppers has pushed up rents and property prices.

In the last two years, average rents have doubled to more than $300 per square foot, Crain's New York reported.

And rents are expected to rise again when Google sign on the dotted line.

'This
 could do for cobblestone Greene Street what the Apple store did for 
Prince St,' Richard Hodos, a retail leasing broker at CBRE, said.

'This is going to be an attraction that will generate excitement for Greene Street, that people will want to come and see.'

Faith Hope Consolo, chairwoman of Douglas Elliman's retail group, said Greene St has 'become the little Madison Avenue of SoHo'.
