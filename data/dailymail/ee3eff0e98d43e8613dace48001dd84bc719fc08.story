It didn't take long for Floyd 'Money' Mayweather to start cashing in on his Marcos Maidana fight, purchasing a third Bugatti Veyron.

The undefeated boxer pocketed a staggering £19million after unifying his welterweight belts against the Argentine, around £1.5m per round.

And despite collecting two of the supercars before the Las Vegas fight, Mayweather claims he has splashed £1.8m ($3m) on another collectable.

Mayweather also posted a clip on Instagram of him cruising around in the Bugatti, a one-of-one Limited Edition Grand Sport.

The car was once the fastest road-legal car in the world, with a top speed of 257mph.

Mayweather will have his next fight on September 13, ruling out a potential meeting with Amir Khan.

Mayweather Promotions chief executive Leonard Ellerbe confirmed a to-be-determined opponent.

Khan, who impressed on the Mayweather undercard with an excellent win over Luis Collazo, is unable to fight in September because he observes Ramadan.

'Floyd will go on September 13 and we're looking at who he's going to fight and where he is going to fight,' Ellerbe told ESPN.

'Obviously, Las Vegas is his home and the MGM Grand is always the leading candidate but we will take a look at our other options.'
