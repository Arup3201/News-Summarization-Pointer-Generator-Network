Sport in schools has slumped despite Coalition promises to create an Olympic legacy through education, new figures have suggested.

Pupils spend less time in sport and PE lessons now than four years ago despite a drive to ‘inspire a generation’ to become more active following the London 2012 games.

The average number of minutes of PE offered to pupils in England has dropped to well below two hours per week, according to a survey by the Youth Sport Trust.

Pupils aged five to seven spend just an hour and 42 minutes per week in PE lessons – nearly 25 minutes less than in 2010.

The findings, coupled with soaring obesity rates among youngsters, paint a ‘bleak and worrying’ picture, according to Baroness Sue Campbell, chair of the YST.

The figures prompted head teachers to warn of an ‘inactivity crisis’ and call on ministers to make school sport a ‘real priority’.

The Coalition came under intense pressure over its strategy for delivering an Olympic legacy after it scrapped £162million of ring-fenced cash for school sport.

It also allowed schools to drop a target to offer at least two hours of PE a week and agreed to the sale of some school playing fields against the advice of its own panel of experts.

In a partial U-turn, the Government unveiled a £150million-a-year PE and sports premium for primary schools, which David Cameron last year committed to continue funding until 2020.

The apparent decline in school sport emerged in the biggest survey of its kind since the Coalition controversially scrapped an annual national study on sport provision, last undertaken in 2009/10.

Responses from 1,392 primary schools and 554 secondaries showed that five to seven-year-olds spend an average of 102 minutes in PE lessons – compared to 126 minutes in the 2009/10 survey.

Among seven to 11-year-olds, 114 minutes are spent in PE – down from 127 minutes recorded four years ago. A similar drop was seen among pupils aged 11 to 14, although levels of sport appeared to rise among 14 to 18-year-olds.

The survey also showed a decline in the number of links between schools and community sports clubs since 2010.

Sebastian Coe was rewarded for his success in organising the 2012 Games by being appointed the Prime Minister’s Olympics legacy ambassador in August 2012. The average number of minutes of PE offered to pupils in England has dropped to well below two hours per week since that time

The YST admitted it was difficult to make direct comparisons with the 2009/10 Government study, which had covered virtually all schools in the country, but insisted its data was ‘statistically reliable’.

The charity launched a manifesto yesterday calling for more lesson time to be devoted to PE and ‘sustained competitive sport in schools’.

Baroness Sue Campbell, chair of the Youth Sport Trust, said the level of physical activity in primary schools paints a 'bleak and worrying picture'

Baroness Campbell said: ‘Reversing the growing levels of physical inactivity amongst young people is a seismic challenge.

‘With one in three children leaving primary school obese or overweight, and less than one in five meeting the minimum recommended guidelines for physical activity, it is a bleak and worrying picture.’

The charity also pointed to research suggesting that plenty of physical activity can lead to improvements in academic achievement.

Baroness Campbell went on: ‘We have set out where we believe any future government should focus its efforts if we are to stand any real chance of reversing the worrying trends that are leading to increasing sedentary lifestyles amongst young people.’

The Department for Education said that last year it commissioned its own survey of 586 primary schools which showed their pupils spent an average of 122 minutes each week doing PE, up 13 minutes on 2013.

A DfE spokesman said: ‘As part of our plan for education, we want children to get into the habit of playing and enjoying sport – both in lessons and after school.

'That’s why we are giving primary school headteachers over £450 million of funding to spend on improving PE – and our own research shows they are using it to deliver more and better sport.

‘Our findings show that primary schools are delivering more than two hours of PE each week, and it has increased by an average of 13 minutes in the last year; 83 per cent of schools also reported an increase in participation in after-hours sports since the introduction of the funding.

‘We are pleased that the Youth Sport Trust’s own figures show that PE lesson time has actually increased for pupils in years 10 to 13.’
