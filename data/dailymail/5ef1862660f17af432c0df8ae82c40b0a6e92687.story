With Stephen Colbert bowing out from his Comedy Central show on Thursday, the network has unveiled the first promo for his replacement Larry Wilmore.

Emmy-winning comedy veteran Wilmore was previously Senior Black Correspondent on The Daily Show With John Stewart.

He was first announced as Colbert's replacement in May when the show was called The Minority Report, but the name has since been changed to The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore.

The promo clips riffs on the idea that Wilmore, who despite his experience isn't a recognizable name, as he introduces himself to a diner full of slightly confused people.

Wilmore promises to bring a bit more diversity to late night television and extra 'Nightly-ness' as he describes it in the clip.

The show, created by Wilmore alongside former Daily Show Executive Producer Rory Albanese, aims to tackle current events from the perspective of the underdog.

The show's name got changed after Fox decided to develop a pilot based on the 2002 Tom Cruise film Minority Report, reported The New York Times last month.

Wilmore has said that the new name may actually convey the show's mission statement more accurately.

'It was never intended to be a show only about minorities,' he said. 'It's a show about underdogs, and that happens in a lot of different forms, whether it's race, gender or whatever.'

The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore is scheduled to premiere on January 19 on Comedy Central, while Stephen Colbert's debut hosting The Late Show won't happen until the spring

Wilmore is a showbusiness veteran who has an Emmy Award to his name and has written for several shows including In Living Color, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, The Office and others. He also co-created The Bernie Mac Show.

The comedian was also a writer on ABC's autumn comedy hit Black-ish, although he has now quit his involvement with that show. 

The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore is scheduled to premiere on January 19 on Comedy Central.

Stephen Colbert's debut as replacement for David Letterman as host of The Late Show is expected in the spring.
