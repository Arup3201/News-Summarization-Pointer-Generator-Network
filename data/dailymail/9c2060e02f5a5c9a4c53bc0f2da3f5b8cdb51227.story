President Francois Hollande has promised French help to Mali after an appeal from the West African nation for international help to counter an offensive by al-Qaeda-linked militants.

The French president said today that the country would not accept the ‘blatant aggression that is threatening Mali's very existence.’

Mali's government appealed for urgent military aid from France on Thursday after Islamist fighters controlling large areas in the north encroached further south, seizing the town of Konna in the centre of the country.

Promising help: French president Francois Hollande said he would not accept the 'blatant aggression that is threatening Mali's very existence'

‘France cannot accept this,’ President 
Hollande said in a speech today. ‘We will be ready to stop the 
terrorists' offensive if it continues.’

Hollande said that France, alongside African partners, would respond to Mali's request for military aid within the framework of U.N. Security Council resolutions.

French diplomatic sources said existing U.N. resolutions would permit a French military intervention in Mali, if needed.

Western powers are worried the alliance of al Qaeda-linked militants that seized the northern two-thirds of Mali in April will seek to use the vast desert zone as a launchpad for international attacks.

‘The French believe that France, and Europe, face a real security threat from what is happening in the Sahel,’ said Jakkie Cilliers, executive director of the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa, adding that if Hollande does send military aid they will seek to make it ‘as short, sharp and contained as possible’.

In turn the European Union will speed up
preparations to send a team to Mali to train the country's army, EU 
foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said today.

The rebel attacks have underlined the need for ‘enhanced and accelerated international engagement’ to help restore state authority throughout Mali, Ashton said.

The EU was due to send 200 trainers to Mali in late February or early March but this will not happen sooner.

‘The European Union will accelerate preparations for the deployment of a military mission to Mali to provide training and advice to the Malian forces,’ she said in a statement.

The European Union would look at targeted sanctions against all groups affiliated to militant organisations ‘if need be’, Ashton said.

More than two decades worth of peaceful elections had earned the Mali a reputation as a bulwark of democracy in a part of Africa better known for turmoil - an image that unraveled in a matter of weeks after a coup last March that paved the way for the Islamist rebellion.

Mali is Africa's third largest gold producer and a major cotton grower, and home to the fabled northern desert city of Timbuktu - an ancient trading hub and UNESCO World Heritage site that hosted annual music festivals before the rebellion.
