Wearing just a chain link suit for protection, these stunning images capture Cristina Zenato kneeling at the bottom of an aquarium tank handfeeding sharks.

The renowned conservationist is pictured dishing out fish from a bucket for lunch to some of the 100 sandbar and hammerhead sharks resident at the SEA Aquarium in Singapore.

With an air tank on her back, Zenato is surrounded by pretty yellow and black sergeant major fish, as she tempts the sharks with food - some of which swim off with whole fish between their teeth.

The Italian diver has been working with sharks for nearly 20 years, but still wears a chainmail suit in case one of the animals is tempted to take a bite. 

Zenato took part in the feeding stunt to promote awareness of the 'I'm FINished With FINS'campaign that aims to dispel the negative perception that sharks are man-eating monsters.
