It may sound like a scene from Star Wars, but scientists have developed a way of controlling genes using just the power of the human mind.

In a similar way that Luke Skywalker uses the Force to control objects, researchers believe their breakthrough technique could one day offer the hope of controlling chronic headaches, back pain and epilepsy.

During tests, human participants were able to make genes in mice produce a specific protein using their thoughts.

Scientists believe the bizarre experiment, in which volunteers were wired up to a machine that read their brainwaves, (pictured) could lead to mind-operated implants for treating disease

In the gene expression experiment, volunteers wore brainwave-recording headsets linked to an electrical current generator.

By thinking in a certain way, they were able to wirelessly turn on the gene chip, causing it to emit near infra-red LED light.

This activated light-sensitive cells in the chip, triggering a cascade of signals that ultimately turned on on the gene for a marker protein called secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (Seap).

Implanted into mice, the chip released the protein into the animals' bloodstreams. 

The method of producing protein in cells is known as  gene expression.   

Scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich believe the bizarre experiment, in which volunteers were wired up to an electroencephalography (EEG) machine that read their brainwaves, could lead to mind-operated implants for treating disease.

The  researchers compared the study to Luke Skywalker mastering the Force in George Lucas' Star Wars franchise.

They said they were also inspired by the game Mindflex, in which players wearing headsets use their brainwaves to 'thought control' a small ball through an obstacle course by operating a fan.

Lead scientist Professor Martin Fussenegger said: 'For the first time, we have been able to tap into human brainwaves, transfer them wirelessly to a gene network and regulate the expression of a gene depending on the type of thought.'

'Being able to control gene expression via the power of thought is a dream that we've been chasing for over a decade.'

To regulate the amount of released protein, participants were asked to adopt three different states of mind - bio-feedback, meditation and concentration.

This activated light-sensitive cells and triggered signals that  turned on on the gene for a protein called Seap. Implanted into mice, the chip released the protein into the animals' bloodstreams

Those who were concentrating on playing a computer game, produced average levels of Seap in the mice. But when completely relaxed in the meditation state, they generated very high amounts of the protein.

For the bio-feedback test, volunteers watched the chip's LED light up in the body of a mouse and were consciously able to switch it on or off with their thoughts. This was reflected by varying amounts of Seap in the animal.

Thought-controlled implants may one day be used to combat neurological diseases such as chronic headache, back pain and epilepsy,  Professor Fussenegger explained.

The implants would work by detecting specific brainwaves at an early stage and triggering the production therapeutic agents at just the right time.

The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.
