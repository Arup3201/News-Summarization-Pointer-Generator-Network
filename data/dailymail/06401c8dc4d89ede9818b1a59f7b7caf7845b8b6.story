Last week, singer Susan Boyle, 52, revealed she was diagnosed with Asperger's a year ago

When
 Annette Lewn's children were young, she longed to join in the chats 
with other mothers at toddler group coffee mornings, but always felt 
like an outsider.

'I desperately wanted to be part of the group, but I
 never seemed to say the right thing and I'd get funny looks from 
people,' says Annette, 42, a school cleaner who lives in Chippenham, 
Wiltshire, with her son Ryan, 15, and daughter Rachel, 14.

'I just don't
 pick up on social niceties at all,' she adds.

Annette has often 
been criticised for being rude or blunt, although she never intends to 
be, and the criticism upsets her greatly.

'When I was a teenager I 
remember a friend asking me what I thought of her new make-up. She 
obviously thought she looked great, but I said she looked like she'd 
upset a paint box all over her face. Everyone else just stared at me in 
disbelief.'

Annette had friends 'but found the reality of having to make conversation stressful, and I'd long to go home and be alone'.

Meanwhile, teachers would scold her for not making eye contact.

'I
 could mask my personality traits by copying the behaviour of others, 
but I just didn't pick up the cues for what was appropriate; it required
 huge effort,' recalls Annette.

As well as her lack of social skills, Annette's hobbies set her apart. While most of her 
friends plastered their walls with pop star posters, she was obsessed 
with maps, and stuck her collection of 30 or so all around her bed.

Then,
 five years ago in her late 30s, Annette discovered the cause of her 
quirky behaviour traits. She has Asperger's syndrome, sometimes referred
 to as a 'mild' form of autism.

Autism is a spectrum disorder 
affecting how a person makes sense of the world, processes information 
and relates to other people.

At one end of the spectrum, some with 
Asperger's can often hold down jobs, marry and - on the surface, at 
least - live a normal life. But their symptoms can still cause a lot of 
distress, with problems in relationships and at school and work.

There
 are around 700,000 people on the autism spectrum in Britain, according 
to The National Autistic Society, with more being diagnosed.

Asperger's
 is much more common in men, although experts are beginning to wonder if
 this is simply because the symptoms are harder to recognise in women.

Annette Lewns, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, has also been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome

Last week, singer Susan Boyle, 52, revealed she was diagnosed with Asperger's a year ago. For
 years she'd thought her difficulties - she was nicknamed 'Susie Simple'
 at school - had been caused by complications at birth. She'd also 
suffered from anxiety around strangers and struggled with eye contact, 
making her feel 'different' and 'an outsider' throughout her childhood. 
In fact, these were signs of Asperger's.

'Many people with 
Asperger's want to be sociable, but have difficulties making friends and
 struggle to maintain them,' explains Dr Judith Gould, of the National 
Autistic Society.

'They don't understand the unwritten social rules 
and can appear aloof or behave inappropriately. This can make them 
depressed and cause them to withdraw.'

The condition is 'particularly
 difficult' to diagnose in females because they are much better at 
masking their symptoms than males, says Dr Gould. 'They know they are 
different, but still want to fit in and make friends, and so will learn 
how to "act" in social situations. Men can do this, too, but they don't 
care as much about fitting in and don't tend to need to be as sociable 
as women.

'Girls also tend to be more passive than boys with 
Asperger's, who are usually more aggressive. Consequently, it's easier 
to detect it in boys.

'The strain of trying to work out how to behave
 and interact can make women anxious, and this can often be misdiagnosed
 as depression or they will develop an eating disorder. They may obsess 
about counting every calorie, for example, or how much exercise they can
 do.'

Developing obsessional interests is another common Asperger's trait.

'Girls
 might, for instance, develop an obsession with a celebrity, a soap 
opera, horses or Barbie dolls,' says Dr Gould. 'What will stand out, 
though, is the intensity of that interest or the rituals of how their 
collections will be displayed. Perfectionism is another common trait. 
And a love of strict routines.'What causes it is not clear, though 
research using MRI brain scans has shown differences in specific areas 
of the brains of children who have Asperger's, including the frontal 
lobe which controls our ability to control and moderate our behaviour.

The condition is 'more difficult' to diagnose in females because they are much better at masking symptoms

Asperger's
 was formally recognised by the World Health Organisation as a distinct 
condition only in 1994. Therefore, many adults, such as Susan Boyle and 
Annette, are only just now getting a diagnosis.

'There are various 
red flags that an experienced clinician will pick up on, such as a lack 
of interest in people in childhood,' says Dr Gould.

Most of those 
with Asperger's have average or above-average intelligence. But 
typically, girls with Asperger's will underachieve at school unless a 
teacher nurtures them, says Dr Gould. 'They have intelligence, but not 
social intelligence: they don't pick up on the whole picture.

'Many 
will go on to struggle in a work situation because, although they can 
focus on the job, they can't do the social chit-chat which can help them
 fit in and get on.'

After leaving school Annette worked at a care 
home, and although she loved the routine, she found getting on with her 
colleagues difficult.

'It baffled me - I just didn't know what I was
 doing wrong,' she says. 'I knew I was different, but I just thought it 
was my fault and that I wasn't the popular type.'

In her 20s Annette met her husband Russell, a firefighter, now 44 (the couple have since separated). 'He carried me in social situations. I felt safe with him,' says Annette. 'I still struggled with female friendships, though.'

Then, when their son Ryan was three-and-a-half years old, he was diagnosed with Asperger's.'Luckily,
 I never had a problem bonding with the children,' says Annette. 'But 
before Ryan's diagnosis, I had wondered if his behaviour was my fault. I
 even went to parenting classes.'

After their daughter Rachel's 
diagnosis at the age of nine, Annette wondered if she herself had it, 
too, as Rachel's behaviour was so similar to her own.

'I started 
doing more research and took an online diagnosis test for Asperger's and
 scored quite high,' says Annette. 'It was a wake-up call.

'My GP 
said there was no point getting a diagnosis, but I knew through my 
experience with my children that the right support can make a 
difference. I was eventually diagnosed in 2011, but only after being 
referred to a psychiatrist for depression by my GP.

'It was a great relief to finally find out why I'd always felt like an outsider.'

Tom
 Madders, head of campaigns at the National Autistic Society, says the 
problem is that the condition is often not spotted. He adds: 'Only 63 of
 152 local authorities have a diagnostic pathway in place - a set route 
for GPs to refer on to a specialist so people with suspected Asperger's 
can be assessed.'

Once the condition is diagnosed, the charity runs 
courses on social skills, a befriending scheme as well as providing 
information on employment and other training.

Since Annette's 
diagnosis, she has completed a maths qualification, taken a cognitive 
behavioural therapy course to help with her anxiety and now works as a 
volunteer mentor in a school.

'My confidence has improved and I can 
finally explain to people why I might come across the way I do,' 
explains Annette. 'I'd love to work in education - and I think with 
support I could study for qualifications.

'All we "Aspies" need is some extra help with our social skills.'
