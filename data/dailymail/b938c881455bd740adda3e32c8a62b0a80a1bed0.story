A lightning strike has killed one person and injured two teens on Fort Myers Beach in southwest Florida.

The Lee County Sheriff's Office says a 41-year-old Scott Wilcox, of Lehigh Acres, was struck along with another woman and another man Tuesday afternoon while on the beach.

The strike apparently killed him instantly. The other two, identified by ABC 7 as Chelsea Gill and Zachary Latawiec, both of Lehigh Acres, were taken to the hospital.

According to a family friend, Latawiec has been put in an induced coma and is in critical condition.

Witnesses say they heard a loud cracking sound when the lightning struck.

The victims were struck on the beach near the Lani Kai resort at roughly 2:10 p.m. as they walked near the water.

Witnesses say Gill was coherent and is expected to recover after a few days in the hospital

Local man Matt Rector, who rents wave runners on the beach, said he knew CPR and tried to help Gill and Latawiec.

'The
 other gentleman didn't have a pulse so we started chest compressions 
mouth to mouth his chest started fluctuating but he's in bad shape,' he said.

He added that Gill was breathing but burned.

According to local media reports, the storm was so intense that rescue workers had to stay in their vehicles for some time after the strike.

'The
 blood was rolling, just floating down to the water's edge and the water
 was turning red right there. It was really terrible,' witness 
Robert Gustafson told reporters.

'I'm shaken up. Three people hit by lightning... at the same time... that's - that's terrible,' added witness Alice Lynch.
