Oussama Assaidi's forgettable spell at Liverpool has ended with a move to Dubai side Al Ahli, the Barclays Premier League club have announced.

The 26-year-old signed from Heerenveen in 2012 but made only 12 appearances for the Reds, spending time on loan at Stoke last season and this.

The highlight of the Moroccan's Premier League career came in December 2013 when his ferocious last-minute strike earned the Potters a dramatic 3-2 win over Chelsea.

Assaidi ended his loan deal with Mark Hughes' side ahead of schedule to complete the move to the Middle East for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the region of £4.7million.

The Reds accepted the offer of making a profit on the player they bought for £2.4million and the deal is expected to be completed in the next 24-hours.

Meanwhile, the Anfield club is yet to receive an offer for holding midfielder Lucas Leiva who has been linked with Roberto Mancini's Inter Milan during the January window.

Despite falling out of favour at the start of the season, the Brazil international has been integral to Liverpool's recent resurgence - leaving the club reluctant to sell him for a proposed £7million.
