Forget a lock of hair or a hand print, the new way to remember your newborn is with jewellery made from breast milk.

Designed by mother-of-three Allicia Mogavero founder of Mommy Milk Creations, the bizarre keepsakes encase the mother's milk in a variety of pendants, rings and bracelets.

Alicia enjoyed breastfeeding her child so much that she wanted to find a way to preserve and commemorate that magic - and so her company Mommy Milk Creations was born.

An inventive mother from Rhode Island has created a selection of jewellery using breast milk

Alicia, in her early 30s, captures what she believes to be an awe-inspiring moment with a secret preservation technique that solidifies the milk in the special resin. The process has taken the artist seven years to perfect.

On receiving a breast milk sample, Alicia 'plasticizes' it, then moulds it into miniature shapes such as hearts, moons, stars or tiny feet and hands.

Alicia's creations have become so sought after that there is currently a 12 month waiting list

The 'milk bead' is then set in clear resin and silver hooks and chains are added. The child's name or a special message can also be included.

Each piece takes her around five hours to make and prices reach around $160 (£97) for a personalised sterling silver locket.

The entrepreneur has had so many requests that she has found it hard to keep up  with the demand. Orders have backed up so much that there is currently a 12-month waiting list.

Alicia from Rhode Island, receives orders from mothers all over the world, from countries such as the UK, Belgium, Germany, Australia, Spain, Italy and China.

However, her novel creations having caused heated debate.

'I've heard it all when it comes to comments about my items' she says. '"What's next, a baby's first poop keepsake?" or "that is disgusting, breast milk is body fluid."' 

Alicia has not been deterred by the comments she's received and says that she is not alone in thinking her creations are beautiful.

'I think breast milk is truly amazing and I'm certainly not the only one who thinks this way.'

For Alicia, preserving her breast milk was especially important as she had experienced many difficulties when feeding her son.  

Alicia started her business after creating herself a bracelet from her own breast milk 

It has taken Alicia seven years to perfect the process of preserving breast milk 

'I had a lot of issues and complications with breastfeeding him, he was tongued tied, had a recessed chin and I unknowingly had flat nipples.

'I would be up in the middle of the night trying to get my son to latch on for hours at a time, it was exhausting and one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life.'

She says that conquering that struggle was something that she was proud of and wanted to preserve.

Alicia's creations have also been met with criticism with people calling her creations 'gross'  

'Those difficulties, the bond with my son and the satisfaction with myself for fighting through was truly a profound experience for me.

'What was so amazing to me was that I could make milk and completely nourish this baby, it was all he needed and that was absolutely amazing to me.

'Something my body makes that I provide with love has my child all plump and happy, it was amazing.' 

It was after creating herself a unique piece of jewellery that turned the business-minded mother's dream into a money-spinner. 

'I made myself a bracelet and started making them for family members with their breast milk, word-of-mouth requests started coming in - and the rest is history.' 

Alicia has revived orders from the UK, Belgium, Germany, Australia, Spain, Italy and China.
