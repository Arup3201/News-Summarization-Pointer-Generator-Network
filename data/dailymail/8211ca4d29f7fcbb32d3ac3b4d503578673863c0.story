Popular: TV chef Jamie Oliver tops the list of influential food figures with 19 per cent of Brits naming him as their main source of inspiration for recipes and advice

Jamie Oliver may have been worrying about trying to break America, but it seems he has made his mark in Britain, with 19 per cent of Brits naming him as their 
main source of inspiration for recipes and advice. 

Celebrity chefs have more influence on the nation’s food choices than guidelines issued by government officials, according to new research.

Delia Smith is in second place with 10 per cent of votes, while Richard Benyon, Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, received only two per cent votes, the same as pop star Cheryl Cole.

While 47 per cent of the UK eat five portions of 
fruit and vegetables a day, only 22 per cent of people meet the government-recommended minimum of two portions of fish a week, according to the nationwide research for Young’s Seafood.

The survey also looked across the UK to determine which regions are following the recommended guidelines for a healthy, balanced diet.

According to government guidelines, people should aim to eat. According to the survey:

47 per cent of people eat five fruit and vegetables a day

Cardiff has the most avid fruit and veg fans with 59 per cent getting their five-a-day, everyday

25 per cent of people drink eight glasses of water

Southampton is the biggest water consumer with 33 per cent meeting the goal

22 per cent of people eat two portions of fish a week

Manchester embraces fish most with 27 per cent eating two portions a week

The research also reveals the healthiest cities from across the UK that meet these guidelines, which provides an insight into different regional approaches to diet.

Cardiff has the most avid fruit and veg fans with 59 per cent getting their five-a-day, everyday.

Southampton is the biggest water consumer with 33 per cent meeting the goal and Manchester embraces fish most with 27 per cent eating 2 portions a week.

The research also raises concerns that food bill cutbacks are compounding the UK’s failure to follow healthy diet guidelines.

While
18 per cent say nutritional value of meals influence their meal choices, almost
double the number of people are more concerned by food prices at 34 per cent.

Nutritionist Dr Carrie Ruxton has urged parents to take-up the 'fish twice a week' mantra at home.

Overall, the research found that 74 
per cent of parents do not include fish in their diet twice a week and 
households with teenagers are most likely to miss the healthy diet 
guideline.

Commenting on the research findings, Dr Carrie Ruxton said, 'There are so 
many misconceptions around fish that these findings are no surprise to 
me. Many of us still consider fish as a luxury and rather expensive, 
difficult to cook or too boney! There are some really easy and 
affordable options out there, and most importantly fish is packed full 
of nutrients, which are essential for a healthy diet.
