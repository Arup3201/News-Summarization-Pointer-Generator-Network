Most of us cursed the late spring. For Judith Wilson, however, it was a blessing. Because it finally allowed her 252ft,  20-year labour of love to bloom – in the most magnificent way.

For 14 years, the amateur gardener carefully trained this wisteria to grow along the full length of her wall. Then, for another six years, she waited.

Each spring it tried to bloom, and each spring the flowers were killed off by frost.

Impressive: For 15 years Judith Wilson, 56, lovingly trained the vine to grow along the full length of her giant garden wall near Witham in Essex

Before: Despite having no gardening training, in 1993 she embarked on the task of trying to get the wisteria to spread across the wall (pictured in 1988)

Different scene: When Mrs Wilson and her husband moved into their home, Wickham Place Farm, the only thing growing on the wall was ivy

Until this year, when the delayed 
spring meant that, for the first time, the whole bush bloomed into a 
13ft-high waterfall of mauve.

Mrs Wilson, 56, started tending the 
wisteria in 1993, to replace the ivy that she and her husband had found 
growing on the wall when they moved into Wickham Place Farm near Witham,
Essex.

‘There was a very neglected wisteria 
growing on the other side of the wall,’ she said. ‘I began pruning it 
and training it to grow on this side of the wall.

‘I didn’t know what I was doing, I just read from books what to do.

‘Year on year it got bigger and 
bigger. It grew ten feet a year in each direction before reaching both 
ends of the wall six years ago.

Outstanding: Thanks to the late spring the mauve-coloured Chinese wisteria senensis is covered in flowers across its full length and 13ft height

Big job: Mrs Wilson spends two whole weeks a year pruning the bush in February and July and replacing 1,000 ties that keep it attached to a wire structure on the wall

Happy: Mrs Wilson, who has four other wisterias, including one which is 100ft long, is a member of the National Garden Scheme and opens her garden to visitors

‘It’s been filling out ever since but
the flowers keep being killed off by the spring frosts. Last year only 
about 10 per cent of the flowers bloomed.’

Mrs Wilson spends two weeks a year 
pruning the plant, thought to be one of the longest wisteria in Britain,
and replacing the 1,000 ties which keep it attached to the wall.

She opens her gardens to the public every Friday to raise money for the local hospice.

Mrs Wilson hopes her beloved plant will stay in bloom for at least another fortnight, as long as the weather stays cool.

She said: ‘When I walk along and see 
it, it brings a lump to my throat and I stand there with tears in my 
eyes. It is so fantastic.’
