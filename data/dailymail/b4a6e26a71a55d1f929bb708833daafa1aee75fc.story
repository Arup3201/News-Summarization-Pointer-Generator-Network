Manchester City have been given a potential Champions League boost by the news that Bayern Munich stars Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery are both doubtful for Wednesday's clash.

Robben missed training on Sunday with a knee problem and fellow winger Ribery has only just returned from injury, playing his first match of the season in the win over Stuttgart, in which he scored.

Bayern also have problems at the back with Holger Badstuber facing months out after tearing a thigh muscle during Saturday's 2-0 victory.

These problems will buoy City and Bayern captain Philipp Lahm says the Bundesliga champions have to find their rhythm to beat their English opponents.

He said: 'We know we have to improve further against Manchester City. They are a top team, they are English champions and we want to start the competition well. We are still missing a bit of rhythm.'

City boss Manuel Pellegrini is not fooled by Bayern's predicament, labelling them the 'most strong team' in the Champions League.

But Pellegrini, who will not be on the touchline on Wednesday as he serves a suspension, insists his side will go for victory in the Allianz Arena, where they won 3-2 last season. 

He said: 'Bayern are the most strong team but my team has a great personality to try to win everywhere. We showed that against Arsenal.

'Last season, we lost three early away games to Cardiff, Aston Villa and Chelsea but we went on to beat Bayern in Munich.

'We have the personality to try to play everywhere in the same way. If we continue like this, it will be a very close game against Bayern.'

City will be without influential defender Pablo Zabaleta, who is banned.
