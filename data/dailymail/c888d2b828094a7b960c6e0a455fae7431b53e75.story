There are concerns about the new powers because the new bill does not establish the definition of a 'network' and allows ASIO to access third party computers to reach the targeted computer. 

This means the whole internet is  open for Australian spies to look at whatever they want.

The use of hastags allow users to filter topics on various social media platforms, with 'trending' tags pointing to the most popular at a certain time.

The Act states that anybody who 'recklessly' discloses "information ... [that] relates to a special intelligence operation".

An authorised ASIO officer can declare any operation 'special'. 

The new laws come at a time when Australia is on a high terror alert warning and teen terrorist Numan Haider was shot dead in Melbourne on Tuesday by a  Victorian police officer after he allegedly stabbed two police officers near the Endeavour Hills Police Station.
