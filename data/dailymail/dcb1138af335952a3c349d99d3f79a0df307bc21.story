England's final warm up game ahead of their Test series in India was held up in by a pitch invader, but this was not your normal streaker looking for attention, instead it was a monkey.

As the afternoon drew to a close in 
on the second day against Haryana in Ahmedabad, the play was temporarily suspended as a langur monkey bounded across the pitch towards 
an unsuspecting female companion sitting on the far side of the pitch.

After a few minutes the monkey made its way off on it's own accord
making a bee-line for a female monkey on the boundary 
edge at the far side.

Within seconds the two became intimate and then disappeared behind the sightscreen.

It may have 
been the most energetic moment of an unexceptional day as England's bowlers had their hosts 172 for 4 in reply to the tourist's mammoth 521 at the close of the second day's play.

There may have been no international sport in Pakistan since 2009 when the Sri Lankan Test team were attacked, and the country were ordered to play their games outside of their homeland for security reasons.

But the British Army have been enjoying a bit of unexpected limelight in Pakistan.
