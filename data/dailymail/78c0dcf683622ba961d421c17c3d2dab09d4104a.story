Rasheem Dowdy of Allentown has been convicted of attempted murder and robbery after shooting a snake dealer at a suburban Philadelphia shopping center

A Pennsylvania man who shot a snake dealer at a suburban Philadelphia shopping center has been convicted of attempted murder and robbery.

The Delaware County Daily Times reports that 35-year-old Rasheem Dowdy of Allentown was also convicted in Delaware County of aggravated assault, robbery of a motor vehicle and a firearms count.

Ridley Township police said Dowdy arranged to buy $12,600 worth of snakes but then robbed the breeder in the Woodlyn Shopping Center parking lot in January 2012.

The robber shot the dealer and fled in his SUV but crashed it in nearby Folsom. 

Police later recovered a handgun and a jacket containing another gun.

Prosecutors said DNA tests of the weapons and clothing matched a sample taken from Dowdy.

The Daily Times reports that snake breeder Mark L. Haas said he had come early to the Woodlyn Shopping Center to meet the customer who'd been texting him about the snakes.

Haas told authorities that as he was returning to his SUV from a bathroom trip while waiting for the contact, he locked eyes with another man and became worried.

He told Assistant District Attorney Sandra Urban that as he began to open the door he felt someone behind him.

'He pushed me and opened the car door the rest of the way, pointed a gun at me and threatened to kill me,' Haas recalled. 'He said, “Throw your keys on the ground, this is real, I’ll kill you.’'

Dowdy started to get into the SUV's driver door the victim backed away to the rear passenger door. Afraid Dowdy would shoot him, he didn't run.

However Dowdy opened fire anyway, lodging a bullet in Haas's back. 

He then allegedly fled the scene.
