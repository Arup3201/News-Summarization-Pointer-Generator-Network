A search is underway for an escaped murderer in Arkansas.

Timothy Buffington, 47, managed to flee from the Pine Bluff correctional facility during an assignment on Saturday evening.

During his escape he held a woman hostage although she was able to get away unharmed.Â 

On the run: Timothy Buffington, 47, was serving a 20 year sentence in prison after he was convicted in 1999 of First-Degree Murder

Cops believe he is armed with a shotgun and a backpack full of ammunition.

Buffington was convicted in 1999 of first degree murder in the death of his ex-wife, Rhonda Combs.

He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and was set to be released in July 2018.

The Arkansas Department of Corrections has called in numerous agencies from across the state to assist in the search for the convict but so far officers have not turned up any sign on the man.

On the lookout: Timothy Buffington escaped from Pine Bluff prison (pictured). He is described as a white male, about 5 feet 6 inches tall and 182 pounds. He's 47 years old with a bald head. He has scars on his abdomen, and upper left arm

There has been no further information as how or why the Buffington escaped the Pine Bluff facility and police have instead deflected any questions by saying they are more focused on getting the suspect back into custody.

A 24-hour search is in progress and officers have insisted that the search will not stop until Buffington is found and under arrest.

He is considered armed and dangerous. Authorities have urged Pine Bluff area residents to be on high-alert and to call authorities immediately upon sighting the man
