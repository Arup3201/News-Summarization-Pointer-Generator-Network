A modern romantic found the perfect way to propose to his girlfriend with a drone atop a snowy mountain in Wyoming.

Capturing the whole occasion on camera, the drone’s operator is featured at the start of the video setting up the device and giving an approving thumbs up.

As the drone flies off into the air, the video rewinds to the couple’s incoming flight from Minneapolis’ Saint Paul International Airport.

Time lapse footage captures the mountains through the clouds from the aeroplane’s window before the flight lands in Jackson Hole Airport.

Upon disembarking the plane, the man, Rich Costello, secretly films his soon-to-be fiancee before another time lapse shot appears to capture the couple's apartment.

After a few more artistic shots of ski lifts and snowboarders relaxing on a mountain, the footage returns to the moving drone.

Focussing on the couple, who stand on a raised part of the mountain, the drone hovers as the man gets down on one knee and presents a ring.

The camera then switches to that of the man’s POV and the woman can be seen gasping and laughing in surprise of the gesture before confirming her answer with a hug.

According to Mr Costello, his fiancee shares his passion for snowboarding and the couple plan a trip to the snowy location every year.

He said: ‘I had known for a while that I wanted to propose to her at the top of a mountain, and I wanted to make sure that we got a good photo of it.’

Mr Costello considered having someone take a picture of the proposal from a helicopter, but found that this was outside of his budget.

Thinking on his feet, the photography enthusiast purchased a drone – a device he began using prior to the trip so as to keep his girlfriend’s suspicions down to a minimum.

Explaining that there are always too many pictures of himself and not enough of his partner, Mr Costello instructed his girlfriend to perform a yoga pose at the top of the mountain.

‘It was the perfect plan. Right as the drone flew over us and she prepared to get into position, I dropped to one knee and proposed,’ he said.

The video concludes with the drone circulating the happy couple, picking up the breathtaking landscape of the surrounding Wyoming mountain range, before crashing to the floor.
