This is the terrifying moment a 6ft-tall stalker abducted a Russian pole dancer he was obsessed with.

The incident happened outside a strip club in the Russian capital Moscow after the 24-year-old strip club worker clocked off from a night shift.

Video footage shows Sidor Borodin, 41, waiting outside for Zoe Pavlova to come out, and then forcing her into his car.

The dancer had finished her shift of topless dancing at the club and was on her way home with a female friend when she was approached.

Although the colleague immediately called club security, the kidnapper simply ignored them and pushed his victim into his car before driving off.

He claimed had taken her home to get to know her better, but after getting repeated phone calls from the owner of the strip club he was persuaded to let the young woman go.

Borodin was apparently a club regular but had been particularly captivated by the new dancer and had decided to pick her up after she finished her shift.

He was later arrested by police who said they were investigating and were waiting to interview the woman to find out what to charge him with, based on what she said.

The man was caught on camera following his victim who he had waited for outside the club
