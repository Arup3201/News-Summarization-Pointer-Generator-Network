Prince Charles has accused middle-class consumers of fuelling the sickening global trade in illegal animal products that is putting dozens of species at risk of extinction.

In an impassioned speech, the heir to the throne warned that an increased slaughter of animals such as elephants, rhinos and tigers to make exotic products that reflect people’s ‘economic prosperity’ is decimating the world’s wildlife.

He was backed by his son, Prince William, who said: ‘I think the consumer deserves to know that the illegal animal parts’ fashionable and luxurious image is at odds with the barbarity of how these animals parts are obtained.’

In an impassioned speech, the heir to the throne warned that an increased slaughter of animals such as elephants, rhinos and tigers to make exotic products that reflect people's 'economic prosperity' is decimating the world's wildlife

The pair were speaking at an Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference co-hosted by Charles and government ministers at St James’s Palace, which has attracted delegates from around the world.

Wildlife authorities have warned that despite the success of protection initiatives in the early 1990s, there has been a 3,000 per cent increase in rhino poaching alone in the last few years due to increased demand, particularly in the Far East where it is prized as an aphrodisiac.

With price of horn reaching more than £40,000 a kilo, it is more valuable than most drugs.

Worryingly, much of the proceeds are now going to fund organised crime, terrorist groups and rebel militias.

Some rhino horn, along with elephant ivory jewellery, trinkets, and carvings, stuffed exotic animals and even items such as tortoise jelly and bear bile - extracted using tubes inserted into the animals’ stomachs - is now being regularly impounded by Border Force officials in the UK.

There has also been a spike in demand in this country for £4,000-a-time Shahtoosh, a woollen shawl so fine it can pass through the centre of a wedding ring, which is woven using the hair of rare Tibetan antelope.

This has led to a dramatic increase in the hunting of the endangered species, which has seen their numbers plummet from one million to just 75,000 in the wild today.

Charles, who is President of the World Wildlife Fund-UK, was flanked by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson at the conference, and appealed for nations to redouble their efforts in wiping out the illegal wildlife trade.

He revealed that it was the fourth biggest transnational crime - just behind trafficking in weapons, drugs and people - with a value of £11 billion and insisted that stamping out the illegal wildlife trade ‘needs to be placed very near the top of the global agenda’.

‘Organised crime has become heavily involved in the illegal wildlife trade because, quite obviously, there is a lot of money to be made, and the risk of being caught is relatively low,’ the royal said.

‘Skyrocketing demand - primarily, but not exclusively, from Asia - for ivory, rhino horn and tiger parts, as well as other products, is fuelling this astonishing explosion in poaching.

‘The bulk of the intended use is no longer for products that can be classified as traditional medicines. Instead, members of the world’s growing middle class are seeking exotic products that reflect their economic prosperity and status.’

He explained that ‘organised bands of criminals’ are stealing and slaughtering elephants, rhinoceros and tigers, as well as other species ‘in a way that has never been seen before’ using ‘weapons of war’ such as assault rifles, night vision equipment and helicopters.

As a result, many animals, he warned, are being pushed towards extinction ‘at an alarming and unprecedented rate’.

He added: ‘It is surely unthinkable 
that these creatures, which have roamed the planet for thousands, if not
millions, of years, could disappear completely within a decade, or even
less.

‘As a father and a soon-to-be grandfather, I find it inconceivable that our children and grandchildren live in a world bereft of these animals.

‘Humanity is less than humanity without the rest of creation. Their destruction will diminish us all.’

Prince William, who is president of conservation charity Tusk Trust, added: ‘I sincerely hope that my generation is not the first on this planet to consider elephants, rhinos or tigers as historical creatures - in the same category as the dodo.’

Afterwards the royal pair examined some of the Border Force’s most recent grisly seizures from this country, including a stuffed baby tiger, barely a few weeks old.

William momentarily closed his eyes in disgust and said: ‘Unbelievable. It’s so small, such a waste.’

He and his father were also shown bottles of ‘snake whiskey’, dried seahorses, ornaments made from ivory that had been covered in boot polish to disguise them and elephant hide books.

He was also told how in February this year, officers from the Border Forces CITIES team at Heathrow Airport intercepted a yellow Rolls-Royce Phantom whose interior had been furnished almost entirely with alligator skin.

Charlie Mayhew, the Chief Executive of Tusk Trust who accompanied the prince, also urged British holidaymakers to use extreme caution when buying holiday trinkets abroad this summer that they had not been sourced from illegally slaughtered animals.

‘Although the vast majority of demand for these items stems from Asia, the issue is one we are not immune from in the UK,’ he said.
