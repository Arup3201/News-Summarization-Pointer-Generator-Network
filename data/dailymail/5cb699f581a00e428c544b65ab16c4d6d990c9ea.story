Google may be looking to reverse the fortune of its Glass headset by making it  more streamlined.

Patent files have revealed a new design for the high-tech headset that features a thinner casing above the left ear, making it more inconspicuous.

It follows news that Google plans to revamp the hardware on the headset next year, too, by replacing its Texas Instrument Chip with an Intel processor.

Google may be looking to reverse the fortune of its Glass headset by making it more streamlined and less obtrusive. Patent files have revealed a new design (pictured) for the high-tech headset that features a thinner casing above the left ear, making it more inconspicuous

Google Glass launched in 2012 to fanfare, but its price, clunky design, as well as how long it is taking to be released to general consumers have dampened this excitement. 

The headset costs £1,000 in the UK and $1,500 in the US, but models now sell on eBay for half this price. 

Developers are also said to be abandoning the platform, and even Google's Sergey Brin appeared at an event recently without the specs. 

A thinner design and faster processor may make it more appealing to a wider variety of people. 

But Google has already attempted to make the device more fashionable with the launch of designer frames, which don't appear to have boosted its charm.

Google Glass has also been criticised by privacy campaigners for allowing wearers to take photos and videos surreptitiously, so making the device itself less prominent may flame these concerns.

The patent (pictured) was first filed in October 2011 but was only awarded yesterday. Google Glass launched in 2012 to fanfare, but its price, clunky design and delays in the device being released to general consumers have dampened this excitement

It doesn't confirm Google is revamping the device, but it does suggest it has been looking at alternative designs since before the headset was released. 

Recently it emerged that the consumer version, which Google promised would go on sale this year, has now been delayed until 2015 - raising questions over its future. 

Of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters earlier this month, nine said that
they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them,
mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the
device. 

Three more have switched to developing for business,
leaving behind consumer projects.

'It's not a big enough platform to play on seriously,' said
Matthew Milan, founder of Toronto-based software firm Normative
Design, which put on hold a Glass app for logging exercise and
biking.

Mobile game company Glu Mobile, known for its
popular 'Kim Kardashian: Hollywood' title, was one of the first
to launch a game on Glass. 

Spellista, a puzzler released a year
ago, is still available, but Glu has discontinued work on it, a
spokesman for the company said.

Another developer, Sean McCracken, won $10,000 in a contest
last year for creating an aliens-themed video game for Glass,
Psyclops, but Google never put it on the official hub for Glass
apps, making it tougher to find. 

He has quit working on updates.

However, plenty of larger developers remain with Glass and there are nearly
100 apps on the official web site including Facebook and
OpenTable. 

Still, there are some enthusiastic developers. 

Cycling and
running app Strava finds Glass well-suited for its users, who
want real-time data on their workouts, said David Lorsch, vice
president of business development. 

And entrepreneur Jake
Steinerman said it is ideal for his company, DriveSafe, which
detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel.

In April, Google launched the Glass at Work program to help
make the device useful for specific industries, such as
healthcare and manufacturing. 

So far the effort has resulted in
apps that are being tested or used at companies such as Boeing
and Yum Brands' Taco Bell.

Google is selling Glass in bulk to some businesses, offering
two-for-one discounts.
