A suburban Houston minister was gunned down early Friday morning during a botched robbery attempt at his home.

Donald Frazier, 69, was shot by Daniel Durham, 31, with his own weapon, which the robber took from the minister and used against him, police said.

Durham was found by police a short time later covered in blood and later admitted to the killing, authorities told the Houston Chronicle.

‘In the early hours of July 4th, Don was the victim of a break in and a fatal shooting,’ Frazier’s family announced on his Facebook page.

‘We are all in shock at the loss of who we believe to have been one of the greatest, most intelligent, compassionate men the world has ever known,’ read the statement.

The family asked for privacy while they mourn his death.

The Harris County Sheriff’s Office told the Chronicle Frazier was awoken just before 1.00 a.m. by a noise in his garage.

He then 
grabbed his gun and went to investigate. A brief struggle ended with the
 thief shooting the minister dead, authorities said.

Deputies
 found Durham only blocks away with blood on his shirt, shorts and legs.
 He accepted blame for the killing during a ride to the station.

‘Durham was transported to the Sheriff’s Office Homicide Unit, where he provided investigators with a statement admitting to the shooting,’ a police source said.

The firearm was found in a nearby trash can, cops said.

It was also revealed by the paper that a neighborhood watch person stopped Durham earlier in the night as he lurked through the subdivision, but he claimed to be visiting his mother and was only going for a walk.

Frazier was ordained in 1974 at only 18-years-old, according to his website.

He does not appear to have had his own church, but traveled often while playing in Christian bands and counselling others.

Durham appears to have had more than a few run-ins with the law, criminal records showed. He has multiple DWI convictions and has spent time behind bars in the past, as well as on probation.

The admitted killer faces a single count of murder, it is not known when he will first appear in court.
