Just a day after telling Daily Mail Australia that she keeps herself in shape by working out on her home gym and has a love for cheeses and desserts, Rebecca Judd has created a storm by posting a picture of herself looking shockingly thin on Instagram.

The model, mother and TV presenter posed in a bikini after having a spray tan - and showed off her super thin frame. Her hips are clearly visible and her legs are amazingly slender.

The image sparked a mixed reaction from the 31 year old's 196,000 Instagram followers, with some saying she had gone too far. Others insisted she looked healthy.

Too thin? Rebecca caused a stir on Instagram with these pictures of herself just six months after giving birth to her second child, Billie Kate

While many of her fans were outraged by the image of Rebecca in a colourful strapless bikini, others stood up for the Melbourne-based star, who is married to AFL player Chris Judd.

In the picture taken on her phone, fitness fanatic Rebeccaâ€™s slim figure appears lean and toned.

One user asked: â€˜How is this nice? Way too skinny.â€™

Glamorous: The sultry model looked gorgeous as she walked the red carpet at the Myer Spring/Summer 2014 collection launch on Thursday night

Meanwhile @wendyrpaton said: â€˜I like following you Bec but please reconsider the message you are sending to young impressionable women.

â€˜You don't need to flaunt yourself like this. Use your beauty in a positive way and a less self-indulgent. I do think you are inspirational, please consider your message. Eating disorders are real and effect many young girls.â€™

@minnapurdue said: â€˜Eat something. Unfollowed.â€™

Transformation: The 31-year-old uploaded a this shot of herself to show how her body had bounced back just three weeks after having Billie

And @cina_bina wrote: â€˜Omg @kaylahayes5 I would rather look the way I do now than look like this, this is so sad ðŸ’€ poor girl.â€™

Meanwhile @laus_sull reasoned: â€˜While I don't agree with all the negative comments and do believe she is genetically blessed (and exercises and eats well), I also believe surely she must have expected she would get these comments from this photo, whether they are warranted or not.â€™

@georgiahad typed: â€˜Moving along from ridiculous negative comments, loving the tan!â€™Â 

By the pool: Three months ago Rebecca uploaded a slim shot of herself in a bikini by the pool

And not everyone agreed with the backlash.

@gabstarflossy added: â€˜I think you look beautiful @becjudd don't listen to the haters. Some of these negative comments are appalling. Some people have no idea when they say stupid things about other people.â€™

And renata_angarano_makeup said: â€˜Well done @becjudd. Your discipline and healthy choices should be taken as inspirational. I can only wish to have as much discipline as you. To all the haters - if you all committed yourselves to exercise as much as you do to bitching, maybe, just maybe, you would be happy with yourselves too.â€™Â 

Beauty: Rebecca and her husband AFL star Chris Judd looked happy as they appeared on the red carpet together in February

Rebeccaâ€™s weight has been a talking point in the past after she has lost her baby weight very quickly.

In May, just three months after giving birth to her daughter Billie Kate, the television presenter uploaded a slim bikini shot of herself showing she had already bounced back.

But on Thursday the brunette told Daily Mail Australia that morphing into her post-baby shape in record time was all down to hard work.

Family time: A few hours after uploading the shot of herself in a bikini, Rebecca shared a snap of herself with Billie Kate

'It's all about Pilates, Pilates, Pilates, Pilates,' she said.

'I wish I could run but I just don't have time. And I just work out on (husband) Chris' reformer equipment all the time, in his man cave. And there's a spin bike down there I use... it's all about being fit and strong and toned.'

And despite sweating it out in the gym, she says she credits her figure to her mother.

As a presenter on Channel Nine's Postcards, food is all part of the job, including decadent desserts and yummy cheeses and Rebecca said:

'I eat all of it! With my role on Postcards sometimes we eat all day long.

'I'm lucky I've got my mum's body type and we can eat whatever we like. I need to work at putting on weight and muscle not losing it,' she said.

Rebecca gave birth to her daughter Billie Kate in January and son Oscar three years before.

The busy working mum appeared to ignore the comments and instead posted a shot of herself with baby Billie three hours later.
