Barack Obama paid his respects to victims of the Holocaust by laying a wreath during his historic first visit to Israel.

Accompanied by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres, the President described his experience at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Centre as 'humbling and inspiring'.

Obama and Netanyahu, long described as quarreling adversaries, appeared together and put their arms around each other as they put on a united front.

Respect: President Barack Obama lays a wreath during his visit to the Hall of Remembrance

Obama was famously overheard on an open microphone at the G20 summit in Cannes two years ago, sniping with Nicolas Sarkozy about Netanyahu.

France's then-president told
Obama, ‘Netanyahu, I can’t stand him. He’s a liar.’ As reporters 
listened in, Obama replied, 'You are sick of him, but I have to deal 
with him every day.’

At Yad Vashem, Obama joked that the embarrassing remarks were meant as fodder for a well-known Israeli TV satire show.

'I know that in Israel’s vibrant 
democracy, every word, every gesture is carefully scrutinized,' Obama 
said. 'But I want to clear something up just so you know: Any drama 
between me and my friend, Bibi, over the years was just a plot to create
material for Eretz Nehederet.'

'That’s the only thing that was going
on,' he said, as the crowd applauded and laughed. 'We just wanted to 
make sure the writers had good material.'

The men visited the graves of the two
of the founders of modern Israel - Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern
Zionism who died in 1904 and former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995.

Remembrance: Obama and Israel's leader leave the grave of Theodore Herzl - the founder of modern Zionism

Concluding his three day visit to 
Israel, President Barack Obama paid respects to its heroes and 
reaffirmed his belief in the Jewish state's right to exist.

He
declared that the memorial illustrates the depravity to which man can 
sink but also serves as a reminder of the 'righteous among nations who 
refused to be bystanders.'

His
visit to Herzl's grave, together with yesterday's visit to see the Dead
Sea Scrolls, the ancient Hebrew texts, were symbolic stops for Obama.

He
was criticised in Israel for his 2009 Cairo speech in which he gave 
only the example of the Holocaust as reason for justifying Israel's 
existence.

'Here on 
your ancient land, let it be said for all the world to hear,' Obama said
today. 'The state of Israel does not exist because of the Holocaust, 
but with the survival of a strong Jewish state of Israel, such a 
holocaust will never happen again.'

Later in the day, Obama will travel 
to Jordan where he planned to meet with King Abdullah II. Among the 
topics is Jordan's struggle with the influx of a half-million refugees 
from the Syrian civil war.

Abdullah has voiced fears that 
extremists and terrorists could create a regional base in Jordan. Before
leaving for Jordan, Obama was to have lunch with Netanyahu and then 
tour the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.

Obama and his hosts arrived at the 
somber Herzl grave site under cloudless skies. Obama approached Herzl's 
resting place alone and bowed his head in silence. He turned briefly to 
ask Netanyahu where to place a small stone in the Jewish custom, then 
laid the stone atop the grave.

'It is humbling and inspiring to 
visit and remember the visionary who began the remarkable establishment 
of the State of Israel,' Obama wrote in the Mt. Herzl guestbook.

'May 
our two countries possess the same vision and will to secure peace and 
prosperity for future generations.'

At Rabin's grave a short walk away, 
Obama was greeted by members of Rabin's family. He initially placed a 
stone on Rabin's wife's side of the grave, then returned to place one 
atop Rabin's side. In a gesture linking the U.S. and Israel, the stone 
placed on Rabin's grave was from the grounds of the Martin Luther King 
memorial in Washington, the White House said.

Rabin, Obama told family members, was 'a great man.

Chatting with the family, Obama joked
that 'Bibi arranged for perfect weather,' using Netanyahu's familiar 
name. He then added that 'Shimon plied me with wine' at the official 
state dinner yesterday evening.

Precision: The stone was created at Prime Minister Netanyahu's request by the Technion¿s Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute in Israel

At one point the talk turned to the 
singer who performed at the dinner, and Obama pointed out that he was 
known to sing, too. 'They had me on YouTube,' he said with a laugh. 
'Check it out - Obama singing Al Green.'

At Yad Vashem, Obama wore a skull cap
and was accompanied by Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, a survivor of the 
Buchenwald Concentration camp who lost both parents in the Holocaust. 
Among his stops was Yad Vashem's Hall of Names, a circular chamber that 
contains original testimony documenting every Holocaust victim ever 
identified.

'Nothing could be more powerful,' Obama said.

The U.S. President has also been bestowed with one of the most unique gifts ever to have been exchanged between world leaders.

The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu handed over a 2,000-year-old stone from Jerusalem embedded 
with a gold-coated silicon chip.

According to the Times of Israel, it 
was created Technion’s Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute at the 
specific request of Netanyahu.

The
chip, placed in the middle of the sacred stone, is engraved with the 
American and Israeli declarations of independence, side by side on the 
tiny area of just 0.04 square millimeters.

Exchange: President Obama presented the Israeli leader with this framed wooden piece of Touro Synagogue -the oldest synagogue in the United States

'It can only be read under a microscope,' said Yvette Gershon a reprsentative from the Technion-Israeli Institute of Technology.

Making
Obama's gift involved a marriage of ancient history and complex modern 
technology: 'The etching was done by accelerating charged atoms, called 
ions, and bombarding them at various points on the surface of the chip,'
said Ms Gershon added.

'When an ion beam hits the chip it creates a tiny recess, in this case 20 nanometers deep,' she explained.

President Obama famously gave former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown a DVD boxset when he visited Washington in 2009.

But
it seems this time he has learned his lesson and brought Netanyahu a 
framed wooden piece of the Touro Synagogue, the oldest synagogue in the 
U.S. and a national historic site.

According
to the Prime Minister's Facebook page, the frame was inscribed with a 
quote from a letter George Washington wrote about the synagogue: 'Every 
one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall 
be none to make him afraid.'
