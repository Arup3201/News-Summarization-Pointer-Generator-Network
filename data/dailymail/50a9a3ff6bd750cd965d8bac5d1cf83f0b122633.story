Two Brooklyn men accused of crystal meth possession tasted victory on Tuesday after a settlement from the New York Police Department awarded them $33,000.

The two plaintiffs sued the NYPD after they were arrested in Coney Island last year by officers claiming Jolly Ranchers in their possession were rocks of crystal meth.

This was in spite of the fact they were leaving a candy store.

Sweet: Two Brooklyn men received a settlement from the NYPD after a humiliating arrest for 'crystal meth' that was actually Jolly Ranchers

An undercover cop claimed he spotted Love Olatunjiojo, 26, and Omar Ferriera, 23, selling drugs in front of an IT'SUGAR candy store in Coney Island.

Officers Jermaine Taylor and Jovanny Calderon moved in to make the arrest, conducting repeated searches of the two that turned up only Jolly Ranchers, saying it was, 'only a matter of time before they found something,â€™ according to the civil suit.

The Daily News reports that when Jimmy Santos, 27, who was nearby with his 3-year-old daughter, came over to protest his friends' arrests, he was cuffed and 'punched in the face by an unidentified cop.'

According to court documents, the officers performed field tests on pieces of Jolly Ranchers that came back positive for methamphetamine and the red and blue candies were taken into evidence.

The city later told the plaintiffs' lawyer, Kenneth Smith, that no field test was conducted.

The three men were held for 24 hours before an NYPD lab concluded that the Jolly Ranchers were in fact not crystal meth.

In the lawsuit against the city, Olatunjiojo also claimed he was strip searched during his detainment.

Smith says the city is not assigning blame to the cops, since there was no way to tell the hard candies were crystal meth.

'To my knowledge there is no evidence in the scientific literature that crystal meth looks like Jolly Ranchers or rock candy, other than from the 'Breaking Bad' show,' he told the Daily News.
