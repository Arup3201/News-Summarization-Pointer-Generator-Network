They have been firm favourites with children for generations.

But according to a new survey, the epic tales of JRR Tolkien have fallen out of favour with today’s youngsters, who are instead opting for authors like David Walliams.

The poll of 508,000 pupils found Walliams’ The Demon Dentist is now the most popular book for under 12s, while John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars is the favourite for teenagers.

JK Rowling’s Harry Potter tales also feature heavily in the top 20 charts, as do Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games books and novels by Cassandra Clare, who penned The Mortal Instruments series.

The annual What Kids Are Reading survey found that while old classics like Roald Dahl’s The Twits were still read at school, children were not necessarily enjoying them the most.

And for the first time since the charts began, JRR Tolkien’s novels including Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit have dropped out of the top 20 most popular.

The survey is based on an analysis of software that assesses the books children read and their understanding of those stories.

Pupils in 2,257 schools took more than nine million quizzes giving details of the books they had read and their favourites.

The results showed that the ‘most read’ charts at both primary and secondary level were dominated by Jeff Kinney’s Wimpy Kid books and Roald Dahl.

The ‘most read’ chart indicates the amount of times a book was read in school, while the ‘popular’ ranking indicates the books that children enjoyed the most.

The findings also showed that in the first three years of school, students steadily read more books each year, peaking at 32.1 books aged 8, but after this, the number declined.

The report said: ‘This would to some extent be expected as older students read longer and harder books.’

But it went on to suggest that while primary school pupils favoured challenging books, by the time youngsters went to secondary school they tended to prefer easier novels.

Report author Professor Keith Topping said: ‘This year’s findings reveal a sharp contrast in the difficulty rating between primary and secondary pupils.

‘Primary school pupils, particularly in Years 1 to 5, show a strong preference for challenging books which are significantly beyond their natural reading age.

‘We then see a marked difference in Year 7 where favoured books are no longer above chronological age, but six months below it and in ensuing years the difficulty of books plateaus or declines.’
