They're one of the most fearsome breeds of dog on the planet, infamous for their aggressive behaviour and jaws that can shake the life out of an opponent.

But for 30-year-old glamour model Jolie Reine from Warrington in Cheshire, the pit bull is nothing more than a cuddly pet and she has not one but three of them.

'I have them because I love them,' she explains. 'I 
really do, I'm just obsessed with them. They're just the best kind of 
dog I've ever come across.'

Safe: Jolie Reine, pictured with her pet Tayra, says pit bulls are unfairly maligned and are wonderful dogs

But pit bull terriers, like the Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasiliero, are one of four dog breeds that British citizens cannot have in their homes without falling foul of the law.

Those who do own one face a £5,000 fine, a six-month prison sentence and the prospect of having their pet taken away and destroyed.

Jolie, however, thinks that the law is unfair. 'You see Red,' she says, gesturing at one of her three pit bulls.

'She was bred for fighting but she 
wouldn't hurt a fly. She's been around my son for two years, around his 
mates for two years and all she wants is love and attention.

'That's not an aggressive dog, is it? It's not her fault that some stupid idiot bloody 
bred her and trained her to be aggressive like that to other dogs. It's 
not the dog's fault, it's the owner.'

Fighting: Unfortunately for Jolie, her dogs Red and Tayra sometimes fight - viciously - with each other

Under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act, it is illegal to own pit bulls, Japanese Tosas, Dogo Argentinos and Fila Brasilieros.

Owners can expect punishments including six months in prison and a six-month fine, while the police have the power to confiscate and destroy these breeds.

However, owners can apply to have the dogs legalised, although this involves a lengthy observation period away from home.

Dogs that are declared safe must be neutered, muzzled in public and can never be let off the lead outside of the home.

Not all pit bull types are banned, however. Staffordshire bull terriers, a harmless breed known for their gentleness with children, look similar but have totally different personalities.

Sadly, their resemblance to the infamous pit bull means they are often abandoned with more Staffies taken in by sanctuaries than any other breed.

Nevertheless, she's the first to admit that owning pit bulls isn't all plain sailing, not least because of their tendency to attack other dogs - and each other.

'It's not the dog's fault, it's the f***ing idiots who train them to fight like that and be so aggressive,' she fumes.

'I
 hate it when they start fighting, hate it. But just because they don't like a
 certain dog, it doesn't mean they're like it all the time.'

But while Jolie has no intention of allowing her pets near a dog fighting ring or teaching them to behave in a vicious fashion, other owners aren't so responsible.

Speaking on Channel 5 documentary, Dangerous Dog Owners and Proud, mother-of-one Tracey Dunn, 43, from Coventry, said she wouldn't mind if her animal 'ripped someone's face off'.

She continued: 'I don't want her to be a soft dog. I 
want her to be really, really vicious.

'I've got a 10-year-old little boy
 in the house and if anybody takes his stuff, I don't care who they are -
 she can rip off their faces.

'If she's going to protect 
my house and bite somebody, that's what I've taught her to do.'

Dangerous dogs have become an 
increasingly common problem in the UK, with an estimated 40 people 
killed by out-of-control hounds in the last decade alone.

Banned: Owning a pit bull in the UK can result in a six month prison sentence and a £5,000 fine

Maligned: Staffies are often confused with pit bulls and although gentle, are regularly abandoned by owners

Nevertheless, Tracey, who owns two Staffordshire bull terriers - a breed that isn't usually vicious and is known to be very good with children - says she feels so unsafe at home, she's happy to risk having a dangerous dog.

'We live on a horrible street and round 
the corner, we get a lot of people who do break-ins a lot,' she adds.

'It's very 
rough round here now and we've got a lot of druggies. If you left 20p on
 the side in your house, they'd take it. That's why you've got to have 
dogs like this.'

For Jolie, her pit bulls are pets and in a bid to keep them safe, she has gone to court to have them legalised - a status currently held by an estimated 2,600 British pit bulls.

Although legalising a dog means police 
inspections, a muzzle when in public and castration to ensure the dogs 
don't reproduce, Jolie says she is happy to go ahead.

Struggle: Tracey, who wants her dogs to be vicious, is having a tough time training her Staffie not to be soft

Play: Although Staffie Anna is happy to attack bottles, she appears reluctant to do the same to people

'I think if pit bulls have to wear a 
muzzle then every other dog should wear one,' she complains. 'Any dog can bite 
another dog so I don't really agree with the muzzle side but I'm definitely
 sticking to the rules.

'I went through all that trouble just to get them 
legalised and I wouldn't risk my dogs' lives. If everyone was a responsible
 owner, there would be no dog fights in public, there would be no dogs 
getting savaged, there'd be no kids getting savaged or anything like 
that.'

She adds: 'They're my family and 
that is it. They're not a status symbol, they're not a weapon, they're 
not for breeding - they're just family and that is it.'
