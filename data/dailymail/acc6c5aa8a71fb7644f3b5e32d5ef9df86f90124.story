Adam Johnson is sat on the Sunderland team bus as it rolls victorious beneath Newcastle’s famous Milburn Stand and past the black and white faces burning red with fury.

With celebratory music dialled to the max, Johnson and his comrades are not exposed to the venom being hissed in their direction.

For those on the inside, there is relief, for those on the outside, rage.

‘It’s better when you win away,’ says the player who has scored in both of Sunderland’s back-to-back 3-0 victories at St James’ Park and is bidding for an unprecedented fourth straight win over their rivals on Sunday.

‘Afterwards, you realise you’ve done it, the music is turned up and you’ve won the game. You get on the bus and you can see everybody there is fuming. That’s the best part. It just makes it a better feeling winning in front of their fans.’

For Johnson, the satisfaction of recent derby victories has been amplified by his team’s perilous position near the bottom of the Premier League.

This time, their situation is not so dire. There is, however, always the fear of defeat.

‘It is an intensity,’ says the Easington-raised Sunderland fan as he describes what it is like to have played in four Tyne-Wear clashes.

‘You can feel that little bit more expectancy. There’s a pressure going into the game. When you get onto the pitch, if you didn’t know it was a derby, you can tell straight away.

‘There is a completely different feeling. There is a tension. It is like a cup final. Everything is just that little bit extra and you get that from the fans. They make it that way.

‘They are nervous, they want to do well, but there’s almost a fear attached to it as well. That’s exactly what it is, fear; everyone wants to win it that badly. That is how I would probably describe it.’

Johnson’s record in the fixture reads won three, drawn one. It was he who provoked Paolo Di Canio’s touchline slide and fist pump in front of the Newcastle fans when he curled home a delightful second in the 3-0 triumph of April, 2013.

Ten months on and he was again doubling his side’s advantage, this time with a close-range poke at the Leazes End as Gus Poyet became the first manager in 46 years to record a double over the Magpies.

‘Those goals are up there with the best in my career,’ says the 27-year-old former England winger.

‘But I think what made it more special over the last couple of seasons is that we really needed the points. We needed the wins regardless of whether it was the derby.

‘We can maybe go into it a bit more relaxed this time. I don’t think there’s so much pressure on us. The onus is all on them.’

Johnson watched on Wednesday night as Newcastle were soundly beaten 4-0 at Spurs in the League Cup semi-final.

That result – coupled with their 4-1 defeat at Arsenal four days earlier – has raised the stakes for United boss Alan Pardew heading in to the derby.

It was only two months ago that he was fighting to save his job, a fact not lost on Johnson.

‘There is pressure on them and there has been pressure on the manager before their recent run,’ he says, referencing the six wins in nine which have lifted Newcastle from bottom up to eighth.

‘We want to make sure the pressure is on them. We’re aware they’ve had a bad result but they are still a lot more points better off than us in the league.

‘Having said that, we’ll take anything we can that makes them tense and use it to our advantage.’

Some of Johnson's team-mates, however, are thought to be a little miffed at the latest comments of head coach Poyet.

The Uruguayan has bemoaned a lack of quality in his side and made a deliberate point of highlighting the shortcomings of his widemen.

Sunderland have drawn 10 times this season – five of them goalless stalemates – and Poyet says he is bored of watching his team play.

Johnson is too cute to be drawn on such issues, but does say: ‘Maybe we can create some better chances and then our finishing will be a bit better, but overall we haven’t been that bad.

‘The hardest part of football is scoring goals and winning games. Sometimes you need to score two or three to win in the Premier League.’

Score three is exactly what they’ve done on their last two trips to Tyneside. Repeat the feat on Sunday and even Poyet might me smiling.
