More vile details have come out of the the trial of a New York police officer accused of conspiring to kill and eat women.

Prosecutors say Gilberto Valle, 28, was involved in an e-mail conversation with a Pakistani man who claimed he was a butcher and sent him a video of a goat getting its throat slashed.

It also emerged in court that Valle had a British 'mentor' who claims to have killed and eaten a five-year-old boy.

At Manhattan Federal Court, testimony by FBI Agent Corey Walsh outlined an an online chat between Valle and Khan last year, where Khan said he 'would love to slaughter a girl and make her meat'.

Target? Kathleen Mangan, right, was the subject of horrifying e-mails between Valle and other internet users. He claimed he could lure his wife to India so she could be eaten

It continues: 'I killed few goat to see what happens to the animal and how its done,' he continued, according to court documents.

'i fond it easy. Its just to use some arm power to lay it down. tie it a little and cut its throat.'

The jury was only shown a still from the video of the goat slaughter as it is so disturbing, reports the New York Post.

Valle, who met Khan on a website for people who fantasise about eating human flesh, wrote that he was 'trying to pick out a girl who i can send over'.

He added: 'i can talk my girlfriend into going to india,' where Walsh said Aly Khan claimed to live.

He was referencing Kathleen Mangan, the woman who would become Valle’s wife about six months later and informed police about her husband's sexual fantasies after she found material on his laptop. The pair have a baby daughter.

They go on to talk about 'humiliating' Mangan, taking turns raping her and then slaughtering her together.

While Aly Khan claimed to be a butcher in India, Walsh said the federal authorities actually traced him to Pakistan.

Khan also remarked that the quality of Mangan's flesh would be slightly lower as she is vegetarian and 'she will taste like a tasty goat'.

Agent Corey Walsh also read passage after 
passage from emails and text messages between Officer Gilberto Valle and
a British man the government said used Moody Blues as a screen name and 
MeatMarketMan as an email address.

Moody Blues claimed he had fantasised about 
cannibalism since he was six-years-old but did not fulfill the desire 
until 35 years later.

In 
one email, Valle told Moody Blues that a softball player he knew was 
'the most desirable piece of meat I've ever met,' and that he planned to
follow her home, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Moody Blues suggested knocking her out with a baseball bat for 'poetic justice'.

Valle later said he wanted to be the British man's 'assistant', and asked him for expert advice on eating human flesh.

He asked: 'Out of curiosity, are feet edible?'

Moody Blues replied: 'Yes. Pretty much everything is,' the court heard.

The men talked about cutting off the 
feet of one woman and barbecuing them in front of her while she was 
still alive. Moody Blues suggested eating the woman alive, but Valle 
responded: 'I'm not really into raw meat'.

The 
charges of conspiracy to kidnap and improper use of a federal database 
system could bring Valle, 28, a life sentence if he's convicted.

The chats were recovered by the FBI from a laptop Mangan turned 
over to the FBI after discovering her husband’s perversion.

Public defender Robert Baum said that
the e-mails were pure fantasy and referenced zeroed Walsh’s earlier 
admission that he and other law-enforcers divided the 'thousands' of 
e-mails and chats found on Valle’s computer into two categories, 
'fantasy' and 'real', with only 40 real.

Walsh also admitted that the feds never found any chloroform, rope or
duct tape in Valle’s apartment — despite those items being included in a
“blueprint” he wrote for kidnapping and cannibalizing former college 
pal Kimberly Sauer — and said Valle didn’t own a van or mountain retreat
he discussed with his alleged co-conspirator.

And Walsh said the feds never put Valle under surveillance during a monthlong probe before his October arrest.

The trial continues.
