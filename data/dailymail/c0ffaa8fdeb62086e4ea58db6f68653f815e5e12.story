Covertly tapping the top of someone's newly opened beer bottle and then standing back as the suds foam out onto the floor is a classic old party trick.

Now Spanish and French researchers are toasting their discovery of the science behind the phenomenon.

Lead researcher Javier Rodriguez-Rodriguez, of Carlos III University in Spain, said cavitation - a phenomenon relevant to such common engineering concerns as erosion of ship propellers - is the mechanism by which bubbles appear in a liquid such as beer after an impact.

Cheers: The science of foaming beer explained

After a sudden bump against a 
bottle's mouth, back and forth movement of compression and expansion 
waves will cause bubbles to appear and quickly collapse. 

The team's investigation of beer 
bottle-fluid interactions demonstrated that the cavitation-induced 
break-up of larger ‘mother’ bubbles creates clouds of very small 
carbonic gas ‘daughter bubbles’ which grow and expand much faster than 
the larger mother-bubbles from which they split. The rapid expansion of 
these daughter bubbles gives the foam buoyancy.

Dr Rodriguez-Rodriguez said: ‘Buoyancy 
leads to the formation of plumes full of bubbles, whose shape resembles 
very much the mushrooms seen after powerful explosions.

Mystery solved: Researchers found that tapping a beer bottle's glass creates 'mother' bubbles, then daughter bubbles that give the foam buoyancy

When the top of a beer bottle is tapped, foam suddenly rushes upwards. Here's why:

‘And here is what really makes the formation of foam so explosive: the larger the bubbles get, the faster they rise, and the other way around.’

He said this is because fast-moving bubbles entrain more carbonic gas.

The team's work is believed to be the first quantitative analysis of the beer bottle foam-over.

Dr
 Rodriguez-Rodriguez added: ‘We wanted to explain the extremely high 
efficiency of the degasification process that occurs in a beer bottle 
within the first few seconds after the impact.’

He said the findings of the study, 
presented at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society (APS) 
Division of Fluid Dynamics, can also be applied to other engineering 
systems. and help experts understand serious natural phenomena such as 
the sudden release of dissolved carbon dioxide in the 1986 Lake Nyos 
disaster.

This saw a catastrophic sudden release of the gas from the Cameroon lake and the suffocation of 1,700 people who lived nearby.
