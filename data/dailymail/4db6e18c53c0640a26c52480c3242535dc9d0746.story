British Airways has cancelled all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone as the Ebola outbreak sweeps through West Africa.

It said it had been forced to protect staff and passengers amid a ‘deteriorating public health situation’.

The news comes as it emerged that a Briton has quarantined themselves at home over fears they may have been exposed to the deadly virus in West Africa.

Flight ban: British Airways has cancelled all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone as the Ebola outbreak sweeps through West Africa. So far nearly 900 people have died in the most-deadly outbreak of the virus yet

The unnamed Cardiff resident is being monitored by doctors and is voluntarily staying away from work and keeping contact with others to a minimum.

The disease has claimed almost 900 lives since February in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria in the world’s worst outbreak. The World Health Organisation warns it is out of control.

BA airline flies four times a week from London to Freetown in Sierra Leone and on to Monrovia in Liberia. Its decision to cancel flights came amid growing fears over whether the epidemic could spread to Britain.

The only other airline to stop any flights is Emirates, which has suspended its service to Conakry in Guinea.

Experts questioned BA’s move yesterday, and said that with up to 750 BA passengers due to fly back to Heathrow on the route each week, it is feared that hundreds could be stranded.

BA said it was trying to get customers on alternative flights out of the cities.

It added: ‘We have suspended our flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until August 31 due to the deteriorating public health situation. The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will keep the routes under constant review.’

But microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington said: ‘It doesn’t sound like very good planning to me if they are leaving people stranded who want to leave. They should have brought them out.’

He described the move as ‘75 per cent over-reaction’, adding: ‘I can see why they did it from a PR point of view but from a virological point of view, it is probably not necessary.

‘The big fact about Ebola is that it’s not that easy to catch.

‘I am not surprised, but slightly disappointed they have taken that step.’ However, another expert said the decision would cut the odds of the disease, which kills up to 90 per cent of victims, from being brought into Britain.

Dr Derek Gatherer, of Lancaster University, said sharing a plane with an Ebola sufferer was ‘extremely dangerous’.

He added: ‘It is more than possible that other people on the plane will become infected.’ Public Health Wales, which runs health services in the region, said the suspected patient in Cardiff did not have symptoms and there were no cases in Wales, adding: ‘We are alert to the possibility of cases in the UK and we remain vigilant to unexplained illness in people who have travelled from West Africa.’

People in Monrovia, Liberia, give a wide berth to the body of a man they suspect has died from the Ebola virus

A spokesman said people cannot be tested for the virus before the onset of symptoms, which take up to 21 days to appear.

He added that the individual has been under surveillance for a week and ‘seems well’.

Meanwhile, infected American aid worker Nancy Writebol was flown back to Atlanta for treatment yesterday after contracting the disease in Liberia.

She follows her colleague Dr Kent Brantly, who returned for treatment on Saturday. Both are said to be making progress.

Ebola victims suffer severe bleeding, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. There is no cure.
