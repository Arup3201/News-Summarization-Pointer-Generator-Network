He's eaten dog in Korea, cobra bile in China and waxed lyrical about the joys of foie gras.

And now food writer Tom Parker Bowles has upset vegan parents who impose their own diet upon their children by lambasting them as 'ridiculous hippies' who are 'guilty of child abuse'.

The gastronomic son of the Duchess of Cornwall made the controversial comments on ITV's This Morning - during a cooking segment in which he demonstrated how to make family-friendly fish cakes from sustainable cod and salmon - and tweeting vegans were not amused.

While adding butter to his potato mix, Parker Bowles told presenters Philip 
Schofield and Holly Willoughby: 'Everyone needs butter because butter is
flavour, and this whole idea that you don't give children fat.....too much fat is bad, but children need fat for their brains to develop.

'All
these ridiculous hippies who bang on and tell us that we shouldn't be 
eating this, we should be eating vegan raw diets...for children, that's 
child abuse, I think.'

The food writer was referring to an earlier feature during the Monday morning show when two mothers had debated whether or not it was acceptable for parents to have sex while their baby was asleep in the same bed - with one mother branding the practice tantamount to child abuse.

Following Parker Bowles' comments, vegan Twitter users began to vent their anger, branding him 'ill informed' and an 'ignorant ass', with one declaring he had reported the incident to TV watchdog Ofcom.

Parker Bowles and other non-vegans then joined the Twitter debate, which soon evolved into one about sustainable fishing.

The writer apologised for the joke but maintained his stance that babies should not be fed vegan diets.
