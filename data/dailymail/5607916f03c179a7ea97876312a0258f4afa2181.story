A teenage girl has become the eighth Tibetan child to set herself alight to protest against Chinese rule over ethnic Tibetan areas, rights groups said today.

Wangchen Kyi, 16, self-immolated and died in western Qinghai province on Sunday evening.

Campaign group Free Tibet reported that her final words were: 'Long live His Holiness the Dalai Lama, long live the Tibetan People'. The London-based organisation said the girl was 16 and and leaves behind her parents and two sisters.

Plight: Wangchen Kyi, a 16-year-old girl, has self-immolated to protest the Chinese occupation of Tibet. She is the 95th person since February 2011 to do so, and the eighth child

The International Campaign for Tibet, another Tibet awareness organisation, said Wangchen set herself on fire on the nomadic grasslands of Zeku county, where she was later cremated.

She was on holiday from Tsekog County Second National Middle School in eastern Tibet at the time of her protest. Authorities confirmed the self-immolation today.

The local community claimed her body and an estimated three thousand local people attended her cremation service at around midnight.

Last week 17-year-old nun Sangay Dolma burned herself alive in front of a Chinese government office. On her hand is written: 'Tibet is an independent nantion'

Voice of America, a broadcasting service funded by the U.S. government, quoted sources who said two trucks of Chinese armed police arrived and forcibly dispersed the gathered crowd and asked them to return to their homes.

The broadcaster also reported that she is survived by her father Sonam Tsering and mother Sermo, and two other siblings.

Ninety-five Tibetans have now self-immolated since 2009, with 28 cases reported in November alone, to protest over what activists say are threats to their religion and culture under Chinese rule.

This wave of self-immolations reveal the desperation among Tibet's youth after 60 years under Beijing's thumb and underlie a harsh crackdown in recent years by the Chinese government any who dare question its sovereignty over the mountain nation.

Last week Sangay Dolma, a 17-year-old nun at the Gonshul Nunnery near the Sangag Mindrol Dhargeyling Monastery, set fire to herself using petrol outside a Chinese government office in eastern Tibet.

She had earlier taken a picture of herself in which the message 'Tibet is an independent nation' can be seen written on her hand.

The Chinese government has sought to crack down on Tibetan dissidents issuing a stern warning to the authorities of eastern Tibet to punish all self-immolators and their relatives - and even those who send condolences to bereaved families.

Tibetan exile Jamphel Yeshi, 27, set himself on fire during a protest in New Delhi in March. He was protesting the Chinese president's upcoming visit to India

It said all government aid would be removed from the families of self-immolators while development projects in communities that have been home to such protesters would be cancelled.

Of the estimated 95 protesters who have set themselves on fire, the majority have died of their injuries. Those who survive, are arrested and taken away. They are rarely seen again, say campaign groups.

Stephanie Bridger, director of Free Tibet, said: 'Tibetans from all walks of life, young and old, mothers, nomads, students, monks and nuns are rejecting Chinaâ€™s occupation of their homeland.'
