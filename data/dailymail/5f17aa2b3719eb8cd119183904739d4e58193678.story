An archeological team are heading to Burma in the hopes of unearthing dozens of British Spitfires said to have been buried there at the end of the Second World War.

Over one hundred unused and unassembled aircrafts were supposedly buried in the Burmese jungle by the RAF in 1945.

The 21-strong excavation team flying out tomorrow will include a 90-year-old war veteran who claims to have witnessed the burial of the Spitfires after the war ended.

Some 36 planes are thought to be lying undiscovered in Mingaladon - one of three potential sites in the country - with as many 124 Spitfires buried in total.

Farmer and aviation enthusiast David Cundall, from Lincolnshire, is spearheading the dig, having spent 17 years and thousands of pounds researching the project.

Speaking at Heathrow Airport's Hilton Hotel, in London, he described plans to return the Spitfires to Britain for restoration to allow them to be flown again.

‘There's lot of rumours about why they were buried but the common theory is that they were buried after the war - in August and December 1945 - because they were surplus to requirements. Somebody gave the order, let's dig a hole and let's bury them.

'They will be restored to flying 
condition and hopefully they'll be flying in about three years’ time at 
air shows, and promoting British industry as well.’

High hopes: Aircraft enthusiast David Cundall, 62, has spent the past 17 years researching and investigating into the case of the missing Spitfires and will finally head to Burma tomorrow

The team includes British war veteran Stanley Coombe, from Eastbourne, who responded to Mr Cundall's appeal for witnesses who saw the Mark XIV Spitfires being buried 68 years ago.

Mr Coombe, who is now in his early 90s, was stationed in Burma at the end of the Second World War and is one of eight eye-witnesses to come forward.

The planes are believed to be buried some 25 to 30 feet below the ground, and Mr Cundall believes they may have been protected from erosion due to a lack of oxygen underground.

Project archaeologist Andy Brockman said: ‘The archaeological team are treating this like a police mystery.

We've
got a missing person, we've got a crime scene, and at the end we'll 
hopefully have the evidence to base a case to say what actually happened
at Mingaladon in 1945.’

Online gaming site Wargaming.net is providing financial support for the hunt, which is hoped will unearth the first Spitfire in about two weeks.

The contract allowing the dig to go ahead will see the Burmese Government take 50 per cent of the value of aircraft recoveredm while Mr Cundall's share will be 30 per cent and his agent 20 per cent.

It followed a meeting between Prime Minister David Cameron and Burmese president Thein Sein earlier this year where Burma agreed to lift the trade sanctions.

Mr Cundall helped persuaded the country's notoriously secretive regime to allow him to search for the lost aircraft, winning their trust over several visits.

The married father-of-three doggedly pieced together their possible location by speaking to the declining number of Far East veterans

He said at the time: 'I’m only a small farmer, I’m not a multi-millionaire and it has been a struggle. It took me more than 15 years but I finally found them.

'Spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes and should not be rotting away in a foreign land.

'They saved our neck in the Battle of Britain and they should be preserved.'

Mr Cundall added: ‘I think this is on the same level as the Tutankhamun find in Egypt.

‘If we're successful, I'd like to repeat what archaeologist Howard Carter said then.

'Lord Carnarvon asked: “Can you see anything?”, and he replied: “Yes, wonderful things”.’
