Micah Richards claims he had chances to move to Chelsea and Manchester United earlier in his career - but he's now loving life in Italy's Serie A with loan-club Fiorentina.

The 26-year-old Manchester City youth product faces English opposition on Thursday evening in the form of Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League and has expressed regret at the way his City career seems to have ended.

Richards made 236 appearances for City after breaking into the first team in 2005 but was only seen 10 times last season under Manuel Pellegrini - mostly in the domestic cup competitions - before moving to Serie A.

'If we didn’t get the investment we did (at City), I’d probably be captain now,' Richards told The Telegraph. 'I probably wouldn’t have left. I had a chance to go to Chelsea five years ago, and Manchester United but I didn’t feel it was right.

'I always enjoyed City. They gave me a chance at such a young age (17). I’ve been a bit unfortunate because whenever I picked up some form I got a niggling injury. With City, if you get an injury you can find yourself out of the team for months.'

Richards, who says he has no hard feeling against Pellegrini or first-choice right back Pablo Zabaleta, still believes it will be tough for young players to get through at City despite the big investment in their £200million new training complex.

'If a manager comes in and the owner says "we want five trophies in five years", can he afford to risk bringing young players through when you need results?' said Richards.

'Patrick Vieira’s doing an amazing job [as City’s Elite Development Squad coach] in getting the best he possibly can out of the kids. But ultimately it is the manager’s decision whether he puts them in or not. If you’ve got Yaya Toure and Fernandinho, who do you leave out to bring a young midfielder through?'
