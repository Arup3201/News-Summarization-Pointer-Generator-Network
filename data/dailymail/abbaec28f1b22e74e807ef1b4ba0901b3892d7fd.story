Jonathan Disegi vomited at a New York City restaurant and bar on Saturday afternoon

A New York advertising executive drank so much that he threw up in front of diners at Bergdorf Goodman's restaurant.

Jonathan Disegi, who is Commonwealth/McCann's executive VP, vomited on the bar and customers on Saturday afternoon.

It appeared he had already been drinking when he arrived at the bar alone, reports Page Six.

A witness said that he was 'bragging to strangers around him that he was in advertising. 

They said he ordered more alcohol, but then when he went to the bathroom the woman eating at the bar asked the staff not to serve him anymore.

The onlooker said that when Disegi came back to the bar, he sat down but promptly vomited.

'He put his head down, and it splashed on the counter, dripping on the floor, and onto a woman's expensive Burberry jacket. Staff rushed to clean it up with napkins.'

The witness told Page Six that Disegi paid the bill, got up and left the restaurant.

Disegi said to Page Six in an email: 'Yes, I had too much to drink. It was a mistake. Publishing this would not be good for my career, and I really beg you to be discreet here. I made a mistake, and I feel terrible.'

The incident brought comparisons of when Mad Men's Don Draper vomited at a funeral and when Roger Sterling threw up at the New York City agency after a restaurant visit. 

Disegi, who leads the company’s Chevrolet account, joined in January.

He previously worked at JWT New York, where he spent over four years serving as global planning director and worked with clients including Microsoft Bing, Kleenex, Nokia, Schick and HSBC.

Commonwealth/McCann told Daily MailOnline that the agency does not comment on personal matters.
