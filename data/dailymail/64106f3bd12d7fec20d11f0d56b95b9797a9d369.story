One year on: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is spending his days in literal solitary confinement at The Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts

One year ago today he and his brother killed three people and wounded 260 with two home-made pressure cooker bombs at the Boston marathon.

Two days after the worst terror attack on American soil since 9/11 the then 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev went to a party and acted as if nothing had happened before launching a rampaging killing and kidnapping spree across Boston with his older brother, Tamerlan.

Now he languishes inside a federal medical prison, where he cannot watch television, read newspapers and is being urged to convert to Christianity by his many supporters on the outside who believe he is innocent.

Imprisoned at the Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, on 30 charges of terror - 17 of which carry the death penalty - Tsarnaev, 20, only receives visits from his legal team, a psychiatrist and his immediate family.

He is allowed one phone call a week and one letter - three pages, double sided - and any newspapers he gets have the classified ads and letters to the editor ripped out.

This is because the government fears any
 coded messages to the young man who allegedly confessed to a jihad 
against the United States from his hospital bed after he was shot during
 his gunfight in suburban Boston four days after the bombings.

He has reportedly recovered from wounds 
to his neck, arms, hands and legs sustained during the bloody gun battle
 on Boston's streets following the murder of MIT police officer Sean 
Collier.

Held under special administrative measures approved by the United States attorney general, Tsarnaev is treated as one of the most dangerous inmates in federal custody and a court order bars his legal team or family from talking about anything he may have said to them.

Since he ran over and killed Tamerlan during the dramatic Watertown shootout days after the bombings, the only glimpse into Tsarnaev's life has been when it was revealed he told his parents in Dagestan that 'everything is good' in a phone call.

Indeed, despite his restricted communication with the outside world, Tsarnaev has been sent thousands of letters - most offering support, some protesting his innocence and others trying to convince him to convert to Christianity.

One such backer is Crystel Clary, a 35-year-old single mother from Wisconsin who told The New York Times she has written to Tsarnaev 10 times a month since the April 15 attacks.

She writes him letters about the latest hip-hop albums from Eminem and the latest Hollywood release.

She has even sent him Valentines Day cards and a birthday card - both of which have been returned.

However, other letters have not been sent back - but Clary has not yet received one reply from him.

Moreso, Clary is adamant that Tsarnaev did not commit the bombings and that the state is lying in its case against him.

'You can tell he didnâ€™t do it,' she said. 'There is too much suspicious stuff going on in this case.'

As Tsarnaev's legal team prepare for his November trial, they have begun to complain about intentionally interference from the prosecutors - who they accuse of dragging their heels on releasing their files.

One reason why he is kept almost to solitary confinement is to halt any attempts he may make to recruit others.

After his capture, 'Tsarnaev reaffirmed his commitment to jihad and expressed hope that his actions would inspire others to engage in violent jihad,' the Justice Department stated in a court filing in August.

And it seems that these visits are not recorded without prejudice towards the 20-year-old bomber.

Indeed, earlier this year, an FBI agent allegedly overheard Boston marathon suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev make a 'statement to his detriment' when his sister visited him in prison.

Prosecutors did not reveal what Tsarnaev said, but they objected to what they called an attempt by Tsarnaev's lawyers to suppress the statement.

Tsarnaev made the remark when an investigator working for his lawyers accompanied Tsarnaev's sister to a prison visit, a meeting that was monitored by an FBI agent, prosecutors said.

The defense investigator started to explain to Tsarnaev's sister the rationale behind special restrictions placed on Tsarnaev in prison, prosecutors said.

They say Tsarnaev, 'despite the presence of an FBI agent and an employee of the Federal Public Defender, was unable to temper his remarks and made a statement to his detriment which was overheard by the agent.'

Tsarnaev, 20, has pleaded not guilty in a terror attack at last year's marathon. Two pressure cooker bombs were placed near the marathon finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 260.

Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev for crimes that include using a weapon of mass destruction.

Tsarnaev's lawyers say the presence of the FBI agent during prison visits by Tsarnaev's two sisters 'has thwarted the defense ability to develop important mitigation information.'
