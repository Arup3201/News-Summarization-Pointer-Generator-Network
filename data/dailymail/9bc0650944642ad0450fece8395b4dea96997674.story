Britain will plunge into a far deeper recession next year than previously forecast, according to a gloomy prediction from top economists.

But the contraction will not be as painful as for those in the eurozone, including France and Germany, which are struggling to tackle the single currency debt problem.

Analysts from Standard Chartered Bank say the UK economy has already started to go into reverse as companies lay off employees and households cope with the spending squeeze.

Painful: The recession will be exacerbated because households will have less money to spend as they cope with the squeeze on finances

And it will continue to stutter through at least half of 2012, shrinking by about 1.3per cent in total, compared to a drop of 1.5per cent in the eurozone countries.

But all European nations will be left in the wake of China and India as their economies continue to surge forward.

'There will be a two-speed world where a fragile West contrasts with a resilient East,' Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered, told The Daily Telegraph.

'The UK has already slipped back into recession this quarter. So much so, that growth of only 0.6per cent in 2011 may be followed by a contraction of 1.3per cent in 2012,' he added.

Standard Chartered was recently ranked the most accurate economic forecaster over the past two years in a survey of 350 companies.

Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted the Bank of England would have to pump another Â£125million into the economy to salvage the recovery.

Chancellor George Osborne has warned that if the rest of Europe heads into recession it 'may prove hard to avoid one' in Britain, even though the Uk has opted out of treaty changes to tie European countries closer together.
