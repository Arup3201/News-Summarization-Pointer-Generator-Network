Comedian Chris Rock made a memorable appearance on NBC’s Today show on Monday as he jokingly suggested introducing a rather desperate measure to improve ratings.

Once promotional duties for his latest movie, Top Five, were out of the way Rock couldn't resist cracking a couple of jokes about the show’s on-going battle for supremacy with Good Morning America.

The funny man started by offering his congratulations on securing an exclusive interview with Janay Rice, the wife of disgraced running back Ray Rice who had his NFL ban lifted on Saturday.

Comedian Chris Rock made a memorable appearance on NBC’s Today show on Monday as he jokingly suggested to Matt Lauer that he get sick like GMA's Robin Roberts to help boost ratings 

Lauer covered his face with his hand as comedian Rock joked about him getting sick to improve viewing figures

‘Today show, you guys are doing good,’ Rock said.

‘You got Ray Rice's wife on, man. You'll show Good Morning America. We got the wife on!’

‘This is one of those times I should have gone to the commercial about thirty seconds ago too late, my bad,’ joked host Matt Lauer, to laughs from the crew off camera.

‘We'll show you Robin Roberts,’ Rock continued.

‘Matt Lauer is going to get sick next,’ he joked as the host covered his face with his hand and shook his head.

Good Morning America host Roberts is fighting fit now following a breast cancer scare in 2012.

GMA was accused by critics of exploiting Roberts' illness for ratings after featuring countless updates on her condition including filming her undergoing a bone marrow transplant in September 2012

The show was accused by critics of exploiting her illness for ratings after featuring countless updates on her condition including filming her undergoing a bone marrow transplant in September 2012.

That particular update included her colleagues Diane Sawyer and Sam Champion wearing surgical masks and singing songs of encouragement.

'It's a fine line between educating the audience and bringing them up to date, and crossing over and turning that into a ratings booster or an audience grabber,' said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University Langone Medical Center at the time.

While TV critic Tom Shales accused GMA of using Roberts’ serious illness as a 'promotional opportunity'.

'ABC has managed to turn the very serious illness of co-anchor Roberts into a huge promotional opportunity for GMA,’ he said.

In Top Five Rock plays a stand-up comedian who hit the big-time and is forced to spend the day with a New York Times' journalist played by Rosario Dawson, right

However Roberts, who returned to GMA in February 2013, received a 2012 Peabody Award for the program. 

The Peabody credited her for ‘allowing her network to document and build a public service campaign around her battle with rare disease’ and ‘inspiring hundreds of potential bone marrow donors to register and heightening awareness of the need for even more donors.’

Rock’s remarks were edited out of a version of his interview that was posted on the Today website on Monday.

Rock has written, directed and stars in Top Five which hits cinemas this week. 

In it he plays a stand-up comedian who hit the big-time and is forced to spend the day with a New York Times' journalist played by Rosario Dawson. 

Rock has described his character as an 'amalgamation of a bunch of comedians,' including himself, Martin Lawrence, Dave Chappelle, Chris Tucker and Eddie Murphy.
