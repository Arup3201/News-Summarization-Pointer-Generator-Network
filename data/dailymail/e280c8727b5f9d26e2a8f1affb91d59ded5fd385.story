After 83 years of wearing his usual white fur-lined red suit, Father Christmas has finally decided to ring the changes when it comes to his fashion choices.

We first saw St Nicholas in his red suit in the Coca-Cola Christmas campaign in 1931, however, this year rather than opting for traditional, Santa has gone for trendy.

Taking inspiration from Father Christmas's already hipster attributes, such as his bushy beard and bobble hat, a creative agency have given him a rather fashionable makeover.

Creative agency Joint London has taken the traditional image of the Cola-swigging Santa and decked him out in the latest designer fashions, here he wears Alexander Wang (right)

Joint London has replaced his seasonal suit with this season's latest fashions including designs from Saint Laurent, Kenzo and Alexander Wang.

Taking his jolly persona as a starting point, the company have decked him out in black leather, flat caps and the Rick Owens design even sees his beard dyed black to complete the ensemble.

The series of illustrations called Designer x Santa have been created for the company's non-profit Christmas card campaign. 

With his full beard and penchant for bobble hats Santa Clause cuts quite the hipster image already, here he opts for a rocker style in black leather by Saint Laurent

The series of illustrations are part of a non-profit project called Designer x Santa

Customers are able to download the cards from the company's website and then 'pay' via twitter by tweeting 'Santa Claus has more style than you... #merrychristmas #designersanta.'

The series of cards are available to download  at designerxsanta.com.
