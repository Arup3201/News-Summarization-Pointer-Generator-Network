It would be a welcome sight for weary travellers in the middle of the Mojave Desert.

A swimming pool has been built in the vast expanse - but visitors face a challenge if they want to take a dip.

The journey to reach the pool starts at the MAK Centre for Art and Architecture in Hollywood, Los Angeles, where the pool's keys have been left - along with a set of GPS coordinates.

Secret pool: The installation was the brainwave of an Austrian artist, built in south-eastern California

The 11x5ft pool, located in south-eastern California and built by Austrian visual artist Alfredo Barsuglia, can be found using the directions, which lead travellers to the vicinity where it’s located.

It is then up to the explorers to spot the hidden pool in the desert setting.

Alfredo, 34, of Vienna, Austria, said he installed it as a nod 'toward the phenomenon of large-scale Land Art installations in deserts around the American West'.

He added: ‘The location of the pool had to be in a very remote area, with no community nearby, only nature, where a man-made sculpture would pop out like an alien species.’

Anyone can go to the MAK Centre and retrieve the key, but each visitor may only keep the key for 24 hours - whether they manage to find the pool or not.

Alfredo says: ‘At first I didn't expect so many visitors at all, but since it's open to the public there are visitors every day.’
