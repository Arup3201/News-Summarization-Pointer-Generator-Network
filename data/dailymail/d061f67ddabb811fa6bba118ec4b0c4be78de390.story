A British helicopter pilot who performed one of the most daring rescues of the Afghanistan war is selling his gallantry medal to raise £100,000.

Captain Tom O’Malley flew his Apache gunship into a Taliban stronghold with two Royal Marines strapped to the side in an extraordinary bid to save a wounded comrade.

He flew the helicopter ship at 60mph then hovered just 20ft above a heavily-defended Taliban fort.

Hero: Captain O'Malley received a Distinguished Flying Cross for the daring raid under heavy enemy fire

Despite machine gun fire, incoming grenades and blinding dust whipped up by his rotor blades, Captain O’Malley landed in the compound.

The two marines leapt from the helicopter and plucked Royal Marine Lance Corporal Mathew Ford from the fortress, allowing Captain O'Malley to fly him out again with minutes to spare.

Lance Corporal Ford had been captured after a botched retreat which left him seriously wounded by friendly fire.

Despite his comrades' selfless rescue, his wounds were too severe and he later died. However, the bravery of his volunteer rescuers was still commended, as it avoided the need for a ground rescue, which could have led to more casualties.

Captain O'Malley was awarded the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross for the action, which his superiors said was conducted with a ‘calculated disregard for his own safety... in the face of a lethal and determined enemy’.

A pilot of a second Apache also received the DFC and the marines involved the Military Cross. Until now the identities of those involved in the mission have not been revealed. 

Captain O’Malley, 47, resigned his commission last year following 27 years army service and is now a civilian flying instructor.

He has put his medal set up for auction for a pre-sale estimate of £100,000 pounds. His awards also include long service medals, and campaign awards for serving in Afghanistan, Northern Ireland and the former Yugoslavia.

Steven Bosley, of Bosleys Auctioneers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said: 'He has decided it is time to sell his medals.

'He has left the army and has a chance to start a new life and I dare say this money will help with that.'

Captain O’Malley was sent on his second tour of Afghanistan in November 2006 and flew Apache Attack Helicopters with 656 Squadron Army Air Corps.

On January 15, 2007, he was tasked with providing air support to around 200 Royal Marines in an assault on the Jugroom Fort in Garmisr, Southern Helmand.

In a desperately confusing situation, Lance Corporal Ford was hit by machine gun fire from one of his allies.

The fellow solider had mistaken the flash of a hand grenade for enemy gunfire, and shot back, wounding Lance Corporal Ford.

The commandos withdrew but in the confusion left the mortally-wounded L/Cpl Ford in the compound and at risk of falling into enemy hands. 

Another helicopter spotted the marine’s body giving off a heat signal which indicated he was still alive.

The four Apache helicopters fired at the Taliban to keep them away from the stricken marine while a rescue plan was worked out.

Captain O’Malley came up with the suggestion of landing in the compound with two marines strapped to the helicopter, the first time such a mission had ever been carried out.

After touching down inside the fort the two marines disembarked, leaving Capt O’Malley and the Apache exposed to the enemy which bombarded the Apache with fire.

Captain O’Malley fired back with his cannon and directed air support cover before the marines returned with Lance Corporal Ford four minutes later.

It later emerged that the marine received two bullet wounds to the arm and chest from friendly fire and a ricochet shot to the head from a Taliban bullet.

It had been suggested Captain O’Malley might have faced a Court Martial as the mission had only tentatively been approved by his Commanding Officer.

But upon their return to base the Royal Marines immediately recommended all the Apache pilots for gallantry medals, which saved their careers.

Bernard Pass, from Bosleys, said: 'This was the most famous British helicopter action ever carried out, like something from a Hollywood film.

'The Taliban were desperate to capture an Apache helicopter and its crew. To fly one at 20ft behind enemy lines and land it in the middle of a firefight required the utmost bravery.

'But the mission was a great morale booster for the troops because it proved that the Royal Marines never left any of their men behind.'

As well as Capt O’Malley’s nine medals, his flying suit worn on the day of the mission is also being sold along with photographs of the Apache with the marines sat on the side when it returned to base.

The auction takes place tomorrow.
