Holly Anderson was found hanged at home after leaving a note to her estranged boyfriend saying she was trying to win him back

A young hairdresser was found hanged at home after leaving a note to her estranged boyfriend saying she was trying to win him back.

Holly Anderson, 19, was found by her uncle at her flat in Failsworth, Oldham, on September 11 last year. 

He raised the alarm was after climbing in through a window, but paramedics couldn't revive her, Rochdale Coroners Court heard.  

Miss Anderson - who was described by her family as an independent, happy-go-lucky teenager with everything to live for - had left her boyfriend a note and had sent him a series of text messages, the court was told.

The inquest heard she wrote 'I am trying to win you back' in the note to her boyfriend she left in her bedroom and said she was 'lost' without him.

She also sent her sister text messages and photographs hours before her death.

The coroner was told that she had sent her sister a text asking her to call her boyfriend and get him to ring her 'one last time'.

But the inquest heard he had had no credit on his phone. 

A coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure, saying he believed she was trying to 'elicit a response' from her boyfriend and might not have intended to kill herself.

Coroner Simon Nelson said: 'She was doing whatever was in her power to gain his attention. I do not believe that I can be sure that Holly intended the consequences of her actions.

'Very sadly, she had gone that one step too far.'

Her mother Lisa Robinson, from Moston, spoke of the family's loss at Rochdale Coroners Court.

She said: 'She was a happy-go-lucky girl who had everything to live for.

'She will be very sadly missed. This has shocked us all and we are totally devastated.

'She had a lovely personality. She was a happy girl who had so much to look forward to. I have no idea what was going through her mind at the time.'

Miss Anderson - who was described by her family as an independent, happy-go-lucky teenager with everything to live for - had left her boyfriend a note and had sent him a series of text messages, Rochdale Coroners Court was told. The inquest heard she wrote 'I am trying to win you back' in the note 

The teenager worked as a hairdresser after studying hair and beauty at Manchester College. She met her boyfriend at the age of 16. He didn't attend the inquest and no statement was read from him. 

A cause of death was given as hanging. Holly's father Lee Stanley, from Newton Heath, said in a statement that he believed they had split up a month earlier.

Paying tribute, he said: 'She was very proud and I was very proud of her.'

Mr Nelson said Holly was upset and 'finding it difficult' to come to terms with the end of the relationship.
