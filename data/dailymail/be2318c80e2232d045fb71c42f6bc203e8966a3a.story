Luis Suarez says he is relieved he can put his four-month biting ban behind him after  a 'bittersweet' debut in Barcelona's El Clasico loss against Real Madrid.

The former Liverpool player assisted Neymar in the fourth minute as Barcelona took an early lead, only for Real to fight back and win 3-1 at the Bernabeu.

But the £75million signing insists he and his team-mates will bounce back from the dispiriting defeat that moved Real within one point of the La Liga leaders.

Suarez on Barcelona bouncing back: 'Although now is a difficult time we have to move on and keep working'

'I am delighted to be able to play again,' said Suarez. 'It's a great relief and I am very happy to have put this period behind me.

'The feeling is bittersweet because of the result but this team has picked itself up many times. 

'It's very tough to play here (at the Bernabeu) but I came to contribute what I could.

'When we were pushing forward to chase the game we lost some control and they are very strong on the counter attack and killed off the game.

'I felt really good, I have been training for a long time with this game in mind and so when the coach made the decision I was in the right shape to play.'

Barcelona manager Luis Enrique insisted afterwards  he was right to start the Uruguay striker following his suspension for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup.

'I don't regret that he started, he did more than I expected him to do, and I substituted him for fitness reasons,' said Enrique. 

'I was expecting a different type of game, not one in which we would be so unconvincing in defence. 

'We have to correct that because if we don't we will really struggle - like we did (on Saturday).'
