A student in Wisconsin has found an unusual way of paying for his studies.

Eric Dahl, nick-named Silo, is a competitive eater and spends his winnings on paying for his education.

The University of Wisconsin computer engineering student ranks third in the world of competitive eating, according to the All Pro Eating rankings.

The professional eater was once rated as number one in the world.

Food galore: The student from Wisconsin has already made $18,000 from eating contests

His next competition is scheduled for Saturday where Silo will try to win $1,000 at a national pizza-eating contest on Library Mall at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Dahl has earned more than $18,000 in prize money or merchandise to help pay for his education.

‘I'm eating for my education,’ he told the NY Daily News. ‘It helps me get through.’

Dahl was drawn to competitive eating in 2011 when he went to the former Big Red's Steakhouse in Madison.

He didn't want to pay for his meal, so he signed up for a challenge: eat a three-pound cheesesteak sandwich in less than 10 minutes and skip the bill. He finished in 5 minutes, 50 seconds.

The first paycheck he got from eating came from Dickey's Barbecue Pit in suburban Minneapolis, where he earned $250 for inhaling nine pulled-pork sandwiches in six minutes.

He also entered a chicken wings competition made with the world's second-hottest pepper, the Ghost Pepper (right)

He said he likes the competition and that he gets ‘pumped when the crowd starts cheering’, he said.

‘I'm friends with other competitive eaters, but once I'm on stage I don't have any friends.’

However, it is not always easy. He once ate Ghost Wings at Girvan Grille in Brooklyn Park, made with the world's second-hottest pepper, Ghost Pepper, after which his stomach cramped for 12 hours.

He also once ate 37 lobster rolls, winning $700.

The 6-foot-3 Dahl said he walks a few miles a day, lifts weights twice a week and plays intramural soccer and hockey to maintain his 220-pound weight.

According to the State Journal, he eats no more than 3,100 calories a day, mostly vegetables to avoid increasing his waistline, and stretches his stomach by eating 10 pounds of cabbage or broccoli in a single sitting followed by a lot of water.
