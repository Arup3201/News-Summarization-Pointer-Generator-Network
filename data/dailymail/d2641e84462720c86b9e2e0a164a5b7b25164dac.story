There was total apathy from England fans as Roy Hodgson's World Cup flops arrived back home on Wednesday - cosseted and indulged to the very end.

There wasn't a single flag-waving supporter to greet the team's privately chartered Boeing 767 when it touched down at Manchester Airport at 1.17pm after the long flight from Rio de Janeiro.

Only a handful of photographers and a class from a primary school on a visit were there to watch coach Gary Neville lead a deflated group of players down the aircraft steps.

Stars including Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Joe Hart were then whisked away to their mansions in chauffeur-driven cars that waited for them on the runway at a private terminal. There was no welcoming party, either, an hour later at Luton airport where the remaining members of the hapless World Cup party disembarked.

In 1990 thousands of fans thronged Luton airport to salute the England players who had reached a World Cup semi-final before being knocked out on penalties by West Germany. Paul Gascoigne appeared on the open-top bus wearing a pair of fake breasts.

But the contrast could not have been starker as this England squad 
returned halfway through the tournament after finishing bottom of Group D
 behind Costa Rica, Uruguay and Italy with just one point.

Joe
 Hart and Phil Jagielka were the first of 16 England players to 
disembark at Manchester, with the remainder of the players flying on to 
Luton. 

Everton's Leighton Baines clutched a guitar that had 
kept him company in Brazil following criticism of his performances 
against Italy and Uruguay.

Rooney wore headphones, while 
Raheem Sterling tried to get over his 'pain' by tweeting a picture of 
the view from the limousine that took him home.

At Luton the rest of the
 players, led by manager Roy Hodgson and FA chairman Greg Dyke, landed 
at a private terminal.

He was the first to come to Roy Hodgson's defence after England's elimination - and FA Chairman Greg Dyke still looked delighted by the manager's World Cup performance as the team touched down at Luton Airport.

Dyke warmly shaked Hodgson's hand on the tarmac as they arrived back home after offering repeated assurances that the manager would still be in his job come the European Championships in 2016.

Hodgson looks set to stay despite public opinion being firmly against him following England's abject showing in Brazil.

Players including Luke Shaw of Southampton 
and Arsenal pair Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were 
chauffeured individually in Mercedes-Benz cars waiting by the runway, 
which then sped away, disappointing the few supporters in attendance as 
staff and players neglected to stop to chat to them.

One of the 
England fans present, Martin Williams, 40, said: 'I am here to show my 
support, it can't be easy for them. We were not expecting them to win 
but thought they might get to the semi-finals. I am disappointed. I am 
glad that Roy Hodgson has kept his job for Euro 2016.

'I blame the 
captain Steven Gerrard, he should have been more aware as a top-level 
Premier League footballer. He plays with Luis Suarez, he should have 
been doubling up and guiding the defenders. There is a lot of 
frustration.'

'England have been very poor,' said Attilio Bruno, 53, an Italy fan. 'Against England, Italy were phenomenal, I was so proud.

'As
 for England, I don't blame the manager, it's the players. They have too
 much money, they are overpaid and they take no pride in wearing the 
shirt.'
