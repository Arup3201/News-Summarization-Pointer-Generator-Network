A couple were threatened with eviction from their home of 42 years for feeding birds in their garden.

Eric Goleby, 74, and his wife Sally, 66, have left mixed corn outside their bungalow in Hickling, Norfolk, for the four decades they have lived there.

But Victory Housing Trust, which owns and manages the social housing, ordered them to stop because of damage allegedly caused to local vehicles by birds.

Threatened: Eric Goleby has left mixed corn outside his bungalow for the four decades he has lived there

Order: Victory Housing Trust, which owns and manages the social housing, told Mr Goleby and his wife to stop feeding birds outside their bungalow in Hickling, Norfolk, because of damage caused to local vehicles

Mr Goleby was warned in a chilling letter headlined ‘anti-social behaviour case’ that if they continue to feed wildlife they could face legal action, prosecution or even be evicted.

The resident, who cares for his disabled wife Sally around the clock, branded the letter that they received ‘threatening’ and ‘crazy’.

He said: ‘After living in Hickling all my life this really hurts. Feeding the birds as we do is not anti-social - far from it. It’s a real privilege to be able to see the birds come here to feed.

The retired factory worker added: ‘Our lives would be bare without the birds. We have always fed them throughout the years because we love wildlife.’ 

Threatening letter: Victory said the complaint had been investigated and the case had since been closed

'We have always fed the birds': Mr Goleby branded the letter that he and his wife received last month 'crazy'

A Victory spokesman said the complaint from a neighbour was investigated and a staff member visited Mr Goleby after he got in touch. The case was later closed because no issues were found.

Dear Mr Goleby,

'Anti-Social Behaviour Case' 

I regret to inform you that Victory Housing has received complaints of anti-social behaviour from your premises caused either by you, your family, your pets or visitors.

As you will be aware from your Tenancy Agreement you are responsible for the actions of all of these people when they are at your home or coming to and from it.

The complaints received relate to food waste being thrown into your garden and neighbouring gardens. This behaviour is attracting birds which are causing damage to vehicles in the area.

If the problems persist or get worse then we will advise you of this and may well consider legal action alongside our partner agencies. Legal action can ultimately lead to the seizure of equipment, prosecution or the demotion or loss of your tenancy.

I would ask that you contact me on the above number as a matter of urgency to discuss this matter. When you call please quote the above reference number to ensure your message reaches me promptly.

Yours sincerely,

Charlotte Mcknespiey 

ASB Officer

He said the resident should have no fear when feeding the birds, and that the tone of letters sent to tenants will now be reviewed by the housing organisation following the case.

The letter accused Mr Goleby of throwing food waste into his garden and those of neighbours.

But the pensioner insisted he buys the feed from a pet shop in nearby Stalham and puts it on the bird table and bird feeders, attracting species ranging from pigeons, to jackdaws, starlings to pheasants.

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says that feeding garden birds is key to their survival during winter when food is scarce.

Charlotte McKnespiey, anti-social behaviour officer at Victory, wrote to Mr Goleby: ‘The complaints received relate to food waste being thrown into your garden and neighbouring gardens. This behaviour is attracting birds which are causing damage to vehicles in the area.

‘If the problems persist or get worse then we will advise you of this and may well consider legal action alongside our partner agencies. Legal action can ultimately lead to the seizure of equipment, prosecution or the demotion or loss of your tenancy.

‘I would ask that you contact me on the above number as a matter of urgency to discuss this matter.’

Today, Victory chief executive John Archibald told MailOnline: ‘I want to emphasise that we have no problem at all with residents feeding birds in their gardens, and at no stage was Mr Goleby told that he should not do so.

‘We apologise if Mr Goleby felt threatened by our original letter, and we do accept that its tone unnecessarily harsh. As a result we are reviewing the letters we send to ensure that they are more appropriate in the future.'
