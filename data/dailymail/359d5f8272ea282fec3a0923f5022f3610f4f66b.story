A prominent lawyer has had his court-ordered payments to his ex-mother-in-law reduced so he can avoid going bankrupt, however last week a court heard he must instead pay contributions towards his ex-wife's rent and car repayments.

High-profile Sydney barrister Alexander 'Sandy' Street is currently embroiled in an expensive dispute with his ex-wife Sally Street's mother, Helen Jenifer McDonald, over money she lent her daughter's  estranged husband when they were married.

Mr Street was told in court despite having his payments to Ms McDonald reduced he must pay part of the rent on his ex-wife Sally Street's Watsons Bay apartment and $2000 per month towards the lease on her Porsche, Sydney Morning Herald report.

The NSW Supreme Court heard Mr Street couldn't afford to pay his many debts if he was to continue paying the same contributions towards Ms Street's car loan and was granted permission to keep more of his barrister's income.

Mr Street also said he was struggling to meet his Tax Office debt while also paying his credit card bills and child support payments to Ms Street.

He now lives at home with his own mother and owes money to his own superannuation account and various other creditors. Mr Street is also obligated to pay $1300 per month to Ms Street in child support and $8600 towards his ex-wifes $1150 per week Watsons Bay apartment.

In July a garnishee order which meant the entirety of Mr Street's income went to Ms McDonald was implemented so he could begin to pay back more than $500,000 he owed her.

Changes to this were made recently so half of the barristers income goes towards to his $230,000 Tax Office debt and the remainder is distributed between Ms McDonald and himself.

Mr Street admitted he borrowed money from his former mother-in-law to pay the mortgage on the Vaucluse home he shared with Ms Street, and believes his ex-wife should foot half the bill.

However a court heard Ms Street is practically broke earning only $600 per month from Centrelink payments and an extra $200 for her musical performances after she gave up her career to raise the couple's children.

The judge, Justice Harrison, said he wanted an outcome that meant all parties involved could survive financially.

If this situation becomes a reality then it is likely that Sandy Street would not be able to pay Helen McDonald's judgment debt as he may face bankruptcy. It is likely that none of the parties would be able to meet their day-to-day costs of living', he said.

Earlier this year Ms Street - formerly a lawyer but now pursuing a career as a jazz singer - told Daily Mail Australia the messy legal dispute between her mother Helen Jenifer McDonald  and estranged husband has left her with no money in the bank and just $3 in her wallet.

Ms McDonald is suing Mr Street for $836,989.39 plus damages over loans she says she made to him to help him pay the mortgage on his Vaucluse home, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Following Ms Street's split from high-profile Sydney barrister Alexander 'Sandy' Street, SC last year, Ms Street's mother Helen Jenifer McDonald and her ex-husband have become embroiled in a legal battle over a disputed loan worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Mr Street is the son of former NSW Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street, and his grandfather and great-grandfather were also NSW Chief Justices.

Ms Street says she is joined on the claim against her estranged husband 'as a matter of procedure' but insists that her mother is not suing her to force her to pay up.

Appearing in court in July, Ms Street said she could not afford a lawyer and told Justice Peter Hamill she had zero dollars in the bank.

'I went and hawked a ring after the court proceedings,' Ms Street told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Street's estranged husband is being forced to sell his share in his barristers chambers in order to pay more than $500,000 he owes Ms Street's mother Helen Jenifer McDonald and a $230,000 tax bill.

The NSW Supreme court ordered Mr Street to pay Ms McDonald $540,729.92 in May.

In July Mr Street asked the court to stay a garnishee order which currently sees all his income paid to Ms McDonald, arguing he could not afford his repayments to the ATO, $1300 per month maintenance payments to Ms Street and his own living costs.

Justice Peter Hamill agreed to stay the order until August 27, provided 50 per cent of his income goes to the ATO and his child support payments are covered. The remaining money is to be split 70:30 between Ms McDonald and Mr Street.

In court on Tuesday Ms Street said she had been told her husband intends to stop paying maintenance payments to cover rent and bills when their divorce is finalised next month.

Ms Street used to be half one of the Sydney law community's most high-profile couples, before her split from estranged husband Alexander 'Sandy' Street, SC, in September last year

'Which mean I'll be out on the streets,' Ms Street told Justice Hamill.

'I have zero dollars in my bank account; I have $3 in my wallet.'

Ms Street also said she could not afford a lawyer. Justice Hamill made a recommendation to the NSW Bar Association to provide her with legal advice.

Ms Street – a former lawyer turned jazz and pop musician – said she did not know anything about litigation because when she practiced she was a mergers and acquisitions lawyer. She officially left the profession in 2007.

Ms Street said she believed the judge's decision yesterday was 'unfair' because she was not allowed to sit in on negations which she said 'documents without any doubt affected my legal rights'.

In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity

'They covered my child maintenance but completely disregarded any rent or bills,' she said.

'It's my livelihood that I have a roof over my head but I wasn't allowed to participate.'

In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity, working for clients such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

But her high-flying legal career is worlds away from her new occupation as a jazz and pop singer, which sees her playing regular live gigs in Sydney nightspots and singing 'flirty' songs on stage with her diamante-encrusted keytar.
