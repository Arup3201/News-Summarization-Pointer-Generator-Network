In the wake of Danny Welbeck’s cut-price £16million move to Arsenal, Gary Neville just could not get his head around the logic of Manchester United’s decision to offload the England striker.

‘How have Arsenal got him for £16m?’ wondered his former team-mate. ‘I can’t work it out. I am struggling to work out the logic, I can’t understand it. It’s odd in two or three ways.’

Nearly three months on, we’re still searching for answers.

Danny Welbeck sealed a £16million move from Manchester United to Arsenal on transfer deadline day

Louis van Gaal attempted to justify the deadline-day sale by comparing the records of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie to the academy graduate, the boyhood fan who had trained with Ruud van Nistelrooy as an 12-year-old and seemed set for a career-long stay at Old Trafford.

The Dutchman, of course, had a point; Welbeck’s 10 goals in two years a meagre return compared to the 38 of Van Persie and 29 of Rooney.

But history is just that, history. Welbeck, at the Emirates and with England, has set about writing a new chapter in new surrounds.

Already this season he has 10 goals for club and country – Rooney has nine, Van Persie, five. Falcao – the man signed to replace Welbeck – has one solitary strike.

But Welbeck is about more than goals, shown by his performance during England’s 3-1 win over Scotland on Tuesday. There he was about graft as well as craft, an indefatigable presence with a willingness to work and worry the opposition backline.

This weekend it is his former employers who should sound caution. On Saturday tea-time Welbeck has the chance to heap yet more misery on the man who let him go.

The 23-year-old comes up against a defence – in the loosest sense – who have shipped 13 goals on the road this season.

Welbeck, better than anyone, will know their weaknesses. But even without insider know-how, United’s shortcomings are no secret. They are limping by, somehow trailing the Gunners by just one point and one place ahead of their showdown in north London.

In their last four they have scraped late points against West Brom and Chelsea, gone down to defeat in the derby at their city rivals and recorded an unconvincing – but much-needed – 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace.

And Welbeck, of course, has a point to prove. He had never agitated for a move away from United. On the contrary, he kept his silence amid prolonged deployment in an unfavoured wide role.

From that domain they deemed his record not comparable to those populating the penalty area – what did they expect?

Now, at Arsenal, he is taking centre stage.

And so it is that observers such as Neville continue to be baffled by United’s decision to let Welbeck go – to a top-four rival, no less - without ever knowing how good he could have been.

On Saturday, they might just find out.
