Le Thi Ba has revealed the horrific moment her husband, Tran Van Lanh, 57, was attacked and killed by a crocodile whilst fishing in the Northern Territory earlier this month.

'We think it was a branch... he wanted to take off the hook, but after fishing he just walked into the mud, below to the water,' Mrs Le recalled the terrifying moments of her husbands death to Nine News.

The newly married couple had lived in Australia for just over a year, and were fishing on the Adelaide River just before sunset.

It was there, the father-of-four and local farmer believed his fishing line was caught on a branch and went below the water to untangle the snagged line.

'He took off the hook but the crocodile attacked and took his arm.'

In a desperate attempt to free her husband from the crocodile's jaw, Mrs Le pulled the line from the water and screamed for help.

It was just after 10pm when Parks and Wildlife rangers and Territory water police shot dead a crocodile with a human leg inside.

Later, the father-of-four's fate was determined when search teams discovered more remains. 

'They said they killed a crocodile... they found only one leg inside the crocodile... and after the crocodile die the body float,' Mrs Le said.

The crocodile named Michael Jackson was part albino and well-known in the local area.

Now, Mrs Le is urging the government to consider a crocodile cull and said there is not enough warnings aimed at non-English speaking communities.

'Kill all the crocodiles everywhere... too many crocodiles in Australia and Northern Territory.

'After my husband died I don’t want to live but I tried to live, to talk to everyone so this won't be the same problem the future.'
