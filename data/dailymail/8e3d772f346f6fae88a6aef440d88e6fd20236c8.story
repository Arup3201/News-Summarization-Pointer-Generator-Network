Forget Furbys and Cabbage Patch dolls, for the children of Nazi Germany sinister toy soldiers depicting Hitler and his henchmen were top of their wish lists during World War Two.

Miniature figurines of the evil German dictator, complete with an adjustable right arm to allow youngsters to mimic a Nazi salute, were among the sought-after toys used to brainwash children in the Third Reich.

The toys were discovered as part of two 
rare collections which sold at auction - one at Durham and the second at
 Dudley in the West Midlands - for more than £7,000.

features Hitler's second in command and deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess.

Other toys found among the 
collections include soldiers of Germany's Wehrmacht in various poses, 
including two lying on the ground taking aim with a rifle and another 
charging with a bayonet.

The toys were mass produced during World War Two as part of the Nazi propaganda machine.

Toy
 shops in the Third Reich stocked the figures and Nazi buildings, which 
were aimed at influencing children, encouraging them to become members 
of the Hitler Youth.

They were made from a delicate composition of plaster, glue, sawdust and linseed oil by toy company Elastolin.

Very few models have survived, and the two rare collections were snapped up by private collectors of the scarcely seen models.

Also featured in the lots were rare models of SA soldiers, also known as the Brown Shirts - the first Nazi paramilitary group

The top lot - the model of Nazi headquarters, the Brown House in Munich - fetched a staggering £1,202 as part of a 22-piece set, when it went up for sale at Vectis Auctions in Stockton-on-Tees in Durham.

Simon Clarke, military consultant at Vectis, said: 'These figures were made by a company called Evastolin in about 1935 and they had been making toys since the turn of the century.

'Toy production basically stopped in 1930 in the UK but Germany was still producing toys up until 1944.

'When the Nazis came into power the toy production was geared to show what was happening in Germany.

'They didn't continue to make many other toys, apart from a few for very small children such as building blocks.

'The toys were used to try and encourage children into the Hitler Youth, and children could also join as younger members from seven or eight, they were geared towards that.'

Mr Clarke added: 'Propaganda was so important that Joseph Goebbels told the makers to improve the features on the personality figures, so they started to make the heads out of porcelain.

'A figurine of Rudolf Hess, which came with the headquarters model, had a movable right arm and the head was also made out of porcelain, which makes it very rare.

'The items were gathered by an expert collector in Germany who scours Eastern Europe for these items and sells them in the UK.' 

The second toy collection originated 
from the estate of a late British diplomat and sold for 35,801 at 
Ashton's Auctioneers in Dudley in the West Midlands.

The lot featured the podium toy with figures of Hitler and his mistress Eva Braun.

There were also dozens of Hitler Youth models which had been cast in various positions including playing musical instruments and waving flags.

Chris Aston, owner of Aston's, said: 'The Nazis would have been aiming to mass market the toys because it was all part of the propaganda, getting the children involved and in the Hitler Youth.

'At the time, they would been what every child wanted.

'Items like this fall into a niche market as a lot of people don't want to collect them because of the history behind them.'
