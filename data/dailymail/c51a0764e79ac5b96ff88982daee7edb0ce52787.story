An Australian commuter turned a boring subway trip on a recent holiday in Hong Kong into a fun pun game to pass the time by.

Melbourne student, Scyler Yang, came up with the idea of creating the puns from the stations on the subway map with his sister on a 15-minute journey from from Admiralty to Mong Kok while on a family trip two weeks ago.

The Malaysian national is a self-confessed 'punster' which he says is not always appreciated by his friends.

Scyler Yang came up with the idea of creating the puns from the stations on the subway map with his sister

The 21-year-old was on a subway in Hong Kong with his family about two weeks ago at the time

The siblings made up eight puns during the 15 minute journey then Scyler was inspired to do more later

'I believe I'm like many of the other Punsters out there - usually making puns among their other (relatively normal) friends in daily life and they all respond with rolling eyes and helpless cries,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'So I suppose I just felt like making puns when I saw the perfect opportunity on the train, especially when the carriage wasn't seriously crowded like how it would usually be.' 

The 21 year old engineering student came up with eight of the puns on the short train trip. 

'One of my sisters and I decided to look at the map of the train line, and we started thinking of puns,' he said.

'When we found a (presumably) good one, I would align and take a picture with my phone camera, so I could edit them later.

'The rest, which are cropped, from an online map, was further inspired by the Singaporeans' version of the MRT puns.'

So has Scyler's new-found recognition for his puns impressed his mates?

'Well, my closer friends typically have the usual rolling of eyes, while others came to congratulate me for my recent slight uprising in Internet fame,' he said.

The puns just keep on rolling from the train journey including the play on words with 'typo' (right)
