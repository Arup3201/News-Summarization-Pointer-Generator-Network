A 32-year-old has been arrested after leading police on an extraordinary chase which began when he crashed his car then tried to outrun an officer on foot.

Dramatic footage of the arrest west of Brisbane, Australia, shows the suspect trying to grab Sgt Tony Harm's gun as he is apprehended.

But the policeman managed to reach his pepper spray, squirting it in the fugitive's face, forcing him to the ground and making the arrest.

While being arrested, a suspect reaches for a policeman's gun, but the officer gets his pepper spray first

Speaking to Channel 9 news, Sergeant Harm said: 'He went for my service firearm there a couple of times.

'I deployed some OC (capsicum) spray and then a Taser thereafter and was luckily able to subdue him. It was a bit of a worry, but you sort of judge the risks and go from there.

'We got him off the streets and he was a bit of a dangerous sort of character to be carrying on like that, racing around at those speeds, so itâ€™s certainly good to get him in custody.'

The pursuit began at around 10.10am as the alleged criminal sped along in a silver Commodore car.

The car is believed to have been stolen, and was also thought to have be carrying a stolen bike in the back.

The
 determined driver managed to evade officers for nearly half an hour, 
but was eventually brought to a standstill after being hit with stinger 
spikes, bursting the vehicle's tyres.

The man then crashed the truck into a ditch before climbing out and fleeing on foot.

The man then runs across several fields before he is eventually tackled by an officer while trying to get underneath a wire fence.

The policeman wrestles with the suspect, who then tries to grab the pistol strapped to his belt.

The drama started when the man was spotted speeding along in a truck, which is believed to have been stolen. He evaded cops for half an hour before being hit with police stinger spikes

Luckily
 the officer manages to reach his pepper spray first, hitting the man in
 the face and eyes seveal times with it, before he gives up and again 
tries to flee.

He
 doesn't get far, however, and is quickly bundled to the floor and 
arrested, and is now facing multiple offences.
