Katie Couric will not head to CNN if her ABC talkshow ends, sources confirmed today.

As MailOnline revealed last week, the former Today co-anchor, 56, has other future projects in mind - fuelling speculation that her daytime programme will not return for a third season next year.

Amid reports that she will join old friend and former 'Katie' executive producer Jeff Zucker at his network CNN, a source said today Katie's special correspondent deal with ABC news would preclude her from joining the cable network for the 'forseeable future'

Interestingly, the source added: 'Jeff has been making progress at CNN and Katie is not the distraction that he's looking for.

'Jeff and Katie are not attached at the hip, they each have their focus on their jobs at hand.'

The pair worked together on the Today show and the source added: 'They're in no rush to be reunited. It took them six years to reunite on a project the last time and no-one should assume it will be any quicker this time.'

Katie is still filming episodes of the first season of her show and will launch a second season in September with new executive producer Rachel Miskowiec on board.

It was reported at the weekend that the buzz inside ABC is that Katie could leave the show after the second season and head to CNN to join Zucker.

'The show was oversold at syndication and hasn’t lived up to expectations,' one source told the New York Post.

'Now everyone at ABC is gossiping that Katie will end up at CNN with Jeff.'

The blonde mother-of-two is a special correspondent with ABC news, which was a key component of her deal when she signed up for her syndicated show.

And this would preclude her from moving to CNN for the 'forseeable future'.

This element of the deal is longer than her talkshow deal, which was signed for two years only.

Last week, a friend admitted it 
was 'too early to tell' if Katie would be back for a third season as 
'there are so many different factors that make a third season discussion
premature.'

Recognisable faces:  Katie, Ellie Monahan and Sarah Jessica Parker joined her at the event

The future of the her talkshow will be made in six months, according to the TV source, who added: ‘There have been issues with leadership and there has been a turnover in staff as we head into the second year.

‘It’s natural when people are going to lose their jobs that they try to complain, but there are a lot of sour grapes.

‘But the reality is that there was always going to be a second year and anyone who suggests otherwise is wrong.’

The friend added: ‘There is a lot that Katie wants to do in the future, 
but at the moment she is concentrating on the talk show.’

Finding her audience: The transition from hard news woman to daytime 'queen', seen here with British pop band The Wanted, was a harder one than expected

Fox News reported an unidentified ABC source who claimed that Katie’s 
eponymous talk show will be cancelled after this first season ends.

The report cited sources who say that her show is an 
'unmitigated disaster' for a number of reasons, including her elitist 
approach to guest selection, her revolving door of executive producers, 
and her reported determination to make the light afternoon talk show a 
hard-hitting news program, all of which is denied.

When Katie moved to ABC following her stint as the first female solo 
news anchor of a nightly news program at CBS, she was hailed as being 
the inevitable replacement for Oprah Winfrey, the long-reigning queen of
daytime who had just stepped down from her show.

Finding a mix: Couric has reportedly clashed with staff over her desire to skip typical daytime talkshow segments (like one on former child stars, seen here with a Full House alum in June) for more news coverage

She launched the show with longtime pal Jeff Zucker on board as her executive producer, he then left to head up CNN.

Michael Morrison came on board in January and will now be replaced by 
old hand Rachel Miskowiec, who previously served as executive producer 
on The Tyra Banks Show, garnering two Daytime Emmy Awards for 
Outstanding Informative Talk Show, the same category Katie landed its 
first Emmy nomination in this year.

The move comes a month after original Katie co-executive producer 
Michael Bass followed his former boss Zucker to CNN. (He was replaced by
Ethan Nelson, with producer Matt Strauss also getting a bump to serve 
as co-exec producer alongside Kathy Samuels.)

After a strong opening, Katie has slipped in the ratings – and is now 
running neck and neck with Steve Harvey, which is managing to narrowly 
beat the show in the key women 25-54 demographic.

This new report comes just days after she revealed that she approached 
about rejoining her former co-anchor Matt Lauer on the Today Show amid 
their ratings battle with Good Morning America.
