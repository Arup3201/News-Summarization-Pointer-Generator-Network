Thousands of exhausted but happy young Queenslanders head home after a week-long party in Surfers Paradise as interstate school leavers arrive on the Gold Coast to begin their schoolies celebrations.

One partier Alex Cahill summed it up on Instagram by posting all of the empty alcohol bottles from the week with a complete inventory on what was consumed.

'7 days, 241 beer bottles, 4 bottles of bourbon and 4 bottles of vodka. QLD you have been good to us, cheers for the ride. #schoolies #schoolies2014,' he posted on Sunday morning after seven days of non-stop party action.

The final night of the official celebrations saw police arrest 29 schoolies on 32 offences with the majority of charges for public nuisance, being drunk in a public place and street offences.

While there was a total of 35 non-schoolies arrested on 45 offences including public nuisance, and drug offences. 

Since the schoolies celebrations began on Friday November 21, 131 schoolies have been arrested on a total of 152 charges.

During the same period, there were 186 non-schoolies arrested on 226 charges. 

Despite more revellers attending schoolies than last year, they were better behaved than in 2013. 

Gold Coast acting Chief Superintendent Des Lacy said he was pleased with the behaviour of the majority of this year's schoolies.

'While the number of schoolies attending the hub this year was up on last year the number of arrests were down,' Acting Chief Superintendent Lacy said.

'This is a clear result of effective policing strategies and a continued strong collaboration between police and a range of organisations including the event organisers, government departments, the local council, and volunteer agencies such as the Red Frogs.'

But there will be no rest for all involved parties in the event as a large number of interstate schoolies have begun arriving on the Gold Coast - the strong police presence will continue throughout the next two weeks.

'The majority of interstate schoolies are over 18, and this will mean our focus will shift towards the policing of licensed venues,' Acting Chief Superintendent Lacy said.

'We want to remind our interstate visitors to do the right thing as we will be out there with a strong presence ensuring that anti-social behaviour and criminal activity will not be tolerated.

 'We will be proactively targeting offences such as consuming alcohol in a public place.'
