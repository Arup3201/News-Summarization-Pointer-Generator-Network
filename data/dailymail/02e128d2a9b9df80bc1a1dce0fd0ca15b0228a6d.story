Supporters of 'meninism', a controversial movement that opposes feminism, have now begun wearing 'meninist' T-shirts.

The online retailer Teespring.com has sold 615 shirts bearing the hashtag #MENINIST at $22.99 each.

'Support the movement by getting yourself the official Meninist shirt. #YesAllMen,' proclaims the product description, seemingly mocking the #YesAllWomen hashtag that circulated social media to raise awareness for violence against women in response to misogynistic postings by Elliot Rodger before his deadly rampage in Isla Vista, California, last May.

Controversial: The online retailer Teespring.com sells two shirts that show support for 'meninism', a movement that opposes feminism

Teespring has sold ten shirts in another style, which reads 'I'm A Meninist.', for $15 each. Its description says: 'Show your pride and tell the WORLD you're a MENINIST! The official t-shirt of #MeninistTwitter!!'

The #Meninist Twitter hashtag began in 2013 as an outlet for men sharing jokes, according to the BBC, which noted: 'Supporters of the hashtag say it's become a channel for men to express the difficulties of being a man in the 21st Century.'

A Meninist Twitter account, which now has more than 600,000 followers, posts misogynistic jokes.
