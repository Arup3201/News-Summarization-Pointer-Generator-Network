After the sweltering heat yesterday at Wimbledon, violent thunderstorms disrupted play at SW19 today as parts of Britain were battered by heavy rain.

Temperatures had soared to 33C yesterday, with trains cancelled and queueing chaos as massive crowds rushed to South London to see Andy Murray in action in the baking heat.

But as southern parts of the country braced themselves for flash flooding following the hot spell, the women's quarter finals were heavily disrupted as rain stopped play.

Heavy downpours arrived shortly before the 1pm scheduled start of play, as tournament officials said there would be a delay of at least one hour.

Covers went on the courts and the Centre Court roof was moved into place so that play could continue.

But the rain was so relentless at Wimbledon that as it pounded down on the Â£80m Centre Court roof, the umpire had to shout to make himself heard during play.

In Sabine Lisicki's quarter-final against Marion Bartoli, a sudden burst of thunder made Lisicki jump as she walked towards the baseline.

Ministers have asked Network Rail to 
explain how train passengers were left 'stranded in very uncomfortable 
conditions' in ultra-high temperatures.

A series of incidents on mainline 
services led to delays and cancellations last night and again this 
morning as temperatures touched 32C.

NR said a number of incidents had 
nothing to do with the hot weather and it was not correct to say that 
the infrastructure could not cope with a heatwave.

Among the passengers whose services 
were disrupted were those on National Express East Anglia trains, where 
there were overhead wire problems.

An NR spokesman said: 'There has been an assumption that everything that has gone wrong was due to the heat.

'But we had incidents that were nothing to do with the heat, such as broken-down trains and trespassing on the line.'

He went on: 'It's not right to say the infrastructure can't cope with the heat.'

The match on Centre Court was the 
only one able to continue in the wet weather, but that did not stop 
hundreds of diehard fans watching the action from under umbrellas on 
Murray Mount.

Although there was guaranteed action on Centre Court, play on Court One was heavily delayed by the unrelenting rain.

The Court One programme began with Czech eighth seed Petra Kvitova's match against 32nd-seeded Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova, with unseeded Austrian Tamira Paszek second on against Belarusian fourth seed Victoria Azarenka.

Elsewhere, lightning struck electrical signalling on train lines in Southall which affected commuters leaving Paddington.

Lightning strikes meant delays of up to 90 minutes on services in the Welwyn Garden City and Hertford North areas of Hertfordshire.

Passengers affected were on trains run by the East Coast, First Capital Connect, First Hull Trains and Grand Central companies.

Passengers travelling on Heathrow Express trains to the airport were among those whose journeys were disrupted.

Another lightning strike was at signalling at Petersfield in Hampshire. This led to 45-minute delays to South West Trains' services between Guildford in Surrey and Portsmouth Harbour.

There were also disruptions to one of the UK's busiest airports after lightning hit an air traffic control tower.

The incident, at Gatwick airport in West Sussex at around 2pm, led to the temporary failure of some ground-based systems.

Planes continued to land but there were no departures for around half an hour.

No one was hurt and there was no structural damage.

Parts of the country are bracing themselves for flash flooding today after forecasters predicted heavy rain and thunderstorms in the wake of the heatwave.

The Environment Agency and Met Office have warned of localised flooding in London, the South East and eastern England, saying up to 40mm of rain could fall in the space of a few hours.

Hail storms are also expected as the weather makes an abrupt U-turn following the hottest day of the year so far yesterday.

The Environment Agency has issued a flood alert for rivers in the London Boroughs of Lewisham, Bromley, Greenwich and Croydon, with up to 30mm of rain predicted.

Surface water flooding could also occur in other regions hit by heavy storms.

TODAY:
Warm with heavy showers or thunderstorms possible in southeast England 
and East Anglia. Elsewhere, a much fresher-feeling day, though with 
showers developing in some central and northwestern parts through the 
afternoon.

TONIGHT:
Most places dry overnight, with showers becoming confined to the far 
southeast and northwest. Turning locally rather cool under clear skies 
in central and western parts.

WEDNESDAY:
A fine day for much of the UK, with sunny spells and a moderate 
westerly breeze. Scattered showers are possible in many areas, most 
frequent in the north and west.

THURSDAY TO SATURDAY:
Generally dry with sunny spells on Thursday. Turning cloudier with 
occasional light rain in northern and western areas during Friday and 
Saturday, but staying fine elsewhere. Feeling warm in sunshine.

An Environment Agency spokesman said: 'Environment Agency staff are on 24-hour alert and teams are monitoring river levels as the band of rain moves across the country.

'The public are encouraged to tune in to local media for weather forecasts for their area and to keep an eye out for signs of surface water flooding.'

The threat of heavy rain comes after 
temperatures soared in a heatwave that saw the mercury reach 32.8C in 
Gravesend, Kent, in the hottest day of the year so far.

A
Met Office spokesman said the 'sheer volume of rainfall falling in such
a short space of time' in some areas could lead to surface water 
flooding in some places.

But the extremely dry spring, which 
has left some parts of east and central England officially in a state of
drought, means that most rivers are at low levels and are unlikely to 
flood.

According to MeteoGroup, showers and thunderstorms are expected in south east England and East Anglia during this morning.

Temperatures in London are not 
forecast to climb higher than 23C, while the west and the north will 
even see the weather turn chilly.

Tom Tobler, a forecaster at 
MeteoGroup, said: 'There will be heavy showers and thunder storms 
developing in South East England and East Anglia during the morning.

'There will be a risk of localised flash flooding but during the afternoon and evening the storms should clear eastwards.'

Temperatures in London and the South East are forecast to drop to 20C later in the week and to 19C elsewhere in the UK.
