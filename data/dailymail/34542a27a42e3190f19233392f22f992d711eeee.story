Border chiefs were plunged into a further crisis last night after an immigration computer system collapsed – leading to lengthy delays in issuing visas.

The meltdown will severely damage Britain’s reputation among business executives and investors, experts warned.

In a further blow, figures exposed the true delays endured by passengers coming into Heathrow last month.

The airport’s operator, BAA, said there were waits of up to three hours simply to clear passport control in April.

The figures appeared to fly in the face of immigration minister Damian Green’s dismissal of reports of long queues as ‘wild suggestions’.

Targets for checking the passports of non-EU nationals were missed on 23 out of 30 days in April, they showed.

The breakdown in the IT system at Lunar House in Croydon could affect tens of thousands working in Britain.

Yesterday it emerged that the UK Border Agency has cancelled dozens of ‘fast-track’ appointments for visa renewals in recent weeks.

Applicants now face at least an eight week-wait for renewals which should take 24 hours. These cost £1,300 and are used mainly by investors and executives doing business in Britain.

Home Office officials said applicants could put their passport in the post instead.

But immigration lawyers said foreign businessmen could not go without their passport while applications are processed.

Andrew Tingley, an immigration lawyer at Kingsley Napley, said the situation was ‘beyond farcical’.

Angry: Labour MP Keith Vaz said the 'shambolic' situation illustrated the country's inability to plan properly for a new scheme

‘The
system that was introduced was not fit for purpose,’ he said. ‘It was 
close to collapse a few weeks ago. It has now collapsed. It’s an 
absolute mess.

‘The
system has now reached crisis point and is impacting on the ability of 
global companies to conduct business within the UK to promote growth and
recovery.

'You have senior global managers and directors of companies saying, “enough is enough”.

‘They’ve
come to the point now where they’re seriously considering not investing
or working in the UK because they can’t access any reasonably competent
system.’ 

‘In the past over £750million has been wasted over e-Borders and £9.1million on unreliable iris scanners.

‘UKBA must ensure they have the technology in place to cope with new policy before it is introduced.’

Next week both major immigration unions will go on strike, raising the prospect of delays of four hours or longer at passport control.

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We are experiencing some IT problems in our Croydon Public Enquiry office which we are working to resolve as  soon as possible.’
