It is a British tradition that has brought joy to millions of families for more than 150 years.

But now a council is trying to ban customers from eating fish and chips wrapped in paper.

Instead, people would have to consume the meal in a more dignified fashion - using a plate and a knife and fork.

Banned: Liverpool City Council wants to ban customers at 'pavement cafes' from eating fish and chips wrapped in paper. Instead, they would have to consume the meal in a more dignified fashion - using a plate, knife and fork

The new rules, proposed by Liverpool City Council, aim to prevent customers from dropping used paper in the street - leading to a pricey and time-consuming clean-up.

If approved, they would apply to shops and businesses with outdoor seating areas, known as 'pavement cafes', in Liverpool city centre.

Nick Small, the council's 
enterprise chief, said: 'We don't want people buying chips, eating them 
outside and then dropping their litter.'

But today, locals spoke out against the 'ridiculous' rules, which they claimed would 'kill off' an age-old British tradition.

Builder Peter Bostock, 57, said: 'Eating fish and chips in newspaper outside with a simple wooden fork is
 one of those joys I remember from childhood and have enjoyed with my 
grandson.

'Why does the council want to be killjoys and take these simple pleasures away? It makes no sense to me to even be thinking about it.'

Meanwhile, retired nursery nurse June 
Haslem, 63, said: 'It is ridiculous. Of all 
the problems with council cut-backs, they are wasting valuable resources
 thinking about this.'

And student
 Jack Longden, 19, said: 'If we are having a night out we just grab the 
fish and chips and sit down outside and eat it. I don't really want a 
full plate, knife and fork to be honest.'

Other locals in Merseyside have taken to social media to hit out at the controversial proposals.

Des Coffey wrote: 'It will put the price up because the plates will cost more,' while Louise Lacy said: 'I despair sometimes. Just provide a bin!'

However, Amy Cartwright claimed: 'If it stops littering, I support it.'

Under the proposed rules, new businesses bidding for a pavement cafe licence could be ordered to serve food on plates with cutlery - rather than in 
newspaper packaging or polystyrene trays.

The move would mainly affect fast food outlets, chippies, kebab houses and takeaways.

Cllr Small said: 'We can see the benefits of pavement cafes being there, we just want them to up their standards.

'It's all well and good for us to
 provide litter bins, but at the end of the day there is still a lot of 
packaging we have to clean up because people just drop it in the 
streets.

'If people have a plate and cutlery, this won't happen. For any new business with a pavement cafe, we are going to make sure they give out plates and cutlery.'

He said that existing businesses could not be forced to adhere to the new rules - but added: 'We would like all businesses with pavement cafes to start issuing plates and cutlery voluntarily.

'The city council's highways team is currently writing to everyone who has a pavement cafe licence to say "make sure standards are where they should be".'

It is thought that customers buying food to take home would not be affected.

The rules follow a major dispute involving the Lobster Pot fish and chip shop in Liverpool's Whitechapel, which was accused of causing a large amount of litter in its outdoor seating area.

The shop was allowed to keep its pavement cafe if it provided outdoor customers with plates and cutlery in an agreement that has paved the way for the latest regulations.

But not all locals have spoken out 
against the proposed rules - with resident Matt Cartwright
 saying: 'It seems sensible. I prefer a knife and fork when I'm eating.'

And Paul McCaffley said: 'Liverpool is
 a great city, but parts of it are filthy. With a plate, knife and fork 
is a better way to eat food.'
