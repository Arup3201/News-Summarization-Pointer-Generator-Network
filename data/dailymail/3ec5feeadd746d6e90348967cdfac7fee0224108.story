British families are paying hundreds of pounds more for the latest technology as global electronics giants see the UK as a ‘Treasure Island’.

The biggest difference was found a top of the range Samsung TV, which was £755 more expensive including sales tax here versus the US, according to research by Which?

Its research comparing prices in this country to the US found the huge mark-ups stretch to big brand tablets, laptops and even software and music streaming services.

The biggest difference was a top of the range Samsung TV, which was £755 more expensive

For example, an Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch laptop was £355 more expensive here, while the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 games consoles were £95 more.

Successive governments have complained how global firms, from fashion and beauty brands to car manufacturers, consistently charge British consumers more on the basis they can get away with it.

The Business Secretary, Vince Cable, campaigned on the issue when the Lib-Dems were in Opposition, but he has done nothing to overcome the rip-offs since joining the Government.

The Which? survey found Amazon is also taking advantage of UK consumers with the price of its Kindle Fire HDX 8.9in 16GB tablet and eReader some £88 more expensive than the US. The Google Nexus 7 tablet works out at £54 more.

The Garmin 2497LMT satnav is £66 more expensive here and the Beats Wireless headphones are £72 more at £250, including tax. 

Consumers in Britain are effectively blocked from buying these goods more cheaply over the web and getting them posted to the UK because of various hurdles erected by the Government and the firms.

Postal costs can be high, while there are also import duties on electronics products bought through websites based in the USA, which will reduce the value of any saving. 

The current threshold before import duty is imposed on goods bought online is £135, which is much lower than £390 figure if the same consumer buys the goods themselves while abroad.

The Which? survey found Amazon is also taking advantage of UK consumers

Global companies will make product specifications slightly different in the USA versus the UK, which creates doubt and confusion as to whether a product will connect to the web or mobile network here. They will also sometimes refuse to honour warranties on items bought overseas.

Which? also found enormous mark-ups on software and digital services offered by global brands. For example, the Adobe Creative Cloud imaging software is £208 more for a 12 month subscription at £563 in this country.

A 12 month subscription to Amazon Prime, which covers delivery and online streaming of films, music and TV programmes, works out at £80 in the UK, which is £21 more.

When in opposition, the Lib-Dem Business Secretary, Vince Cable, lambasted the last government for failing to put an end to rip-off Britain

Similarly, the music streaming service Spotify charges British customers £120 a year, which compares to £71 in California. Microsoft and Norton also punish consumers here with higher bills.

Part of the price difference can be explained by the fact the UK has a very high VAT rate of 20per cent.

By comparison, the figure in California is 8.41per cent on physical goods and zero on digital services or products.

Even when tax is excluded from the equation the Samsung UE65H8000 TV, which is a Smart 65inch TV with internet access and a curved LED screen, was £402 more expensive to British families when the survey was conducted.

Which? wants manufacturers to play fair and explain why tech products in the UK are more expensive in comparison to the US.

It is also calling on the Government to raise the current threshold for import duty on goods bought online to the same threshold as that placed on goods brought back from abroad, so shoppers can take advantage of cheaper goods on sale in the US.

Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘UK consumers are getting a raw deal by paying up to hundreds of pounds more for the same tech products on sale in the US. Manufacturers should play fair and explain why consumers are paying more for buying in the UK.’ 

Companies like Amazon claim the higher prices in this country are the results of the higher costs of doing business here, in terms of staff and business taxes and rates.

However, the US company has come under fire for the fact that it has gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying its fair share of taxes, despite sales of more than £4.5billion a year in Britain.

The firm has also faced protests over its failure to pay a living wage to employees here.

The firm has defended its higher prices, saying ‘Operating costs differ by country, but as with all products on Amazon, we work hard to offer customers the lowest possible prices.

‘There are different, and higher, taxes in Europe, as well as higher transport and other operating costs but we are always working to try and lower them.’

When in opposition, the Lib-Dem Business Secretary, Vince Cable, lambasted the last government for failing to put an end to rip-off Britain.

He pointed out: ‘The value of the web is that we can now find out what is going on. It is easier than in the past to know that we are being ripped off.

‘The only rational explanation for price differentials is discrimination.’ 

He said the last government and Office of Fair Trading had not been active enough in protecting consumers.

He has since scrapped the OFT, removing a key protection for consumers against unfair prices.
