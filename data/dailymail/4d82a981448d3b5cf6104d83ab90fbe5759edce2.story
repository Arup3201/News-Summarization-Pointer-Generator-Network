As if all the barbecues, picnics and sunny days in the garden weren’t enough, the current warm weather has one more treat in store – an early pot of blackberry jam.  

The fruit is ripening almost a month ahead of schedule, leaving gardeners and walkers stunned.

Sightings of blackberry bushes – common in gardens throughout Britain – loaded with fruit have risen by four times on last year.

Blackberries: The fruit is ripening almost a month ahead of schedule, leaving gardeners and walkers stunned

The crops usually ripen in August, with many berries not developing into their most juicy state until late September.

This year’s early blackberry crop – described as ‘unusual’ by an expert – has been noted in data collected by scientists to record climate change.

The Woodland Trust’s Dr Kate Lewthwaite said: ‘It is perhaps more common than people might realise to see blackberries in July, but what is unusual is that we have had a far wider abundance across the UK this year than last year.’

She told The Independent on Sunday: ‘This fits into a longer-term trend where autumn fruiting has been two or three weeks earlier over the last 15 years or so.’

And the mild winter was responsible for a bumper crop of strawberries, which also ripened earlier than usual.

'They may be sweeter and more nutrient-dense, due to the high light levels and low rainfall'

Dr Lewthwaite said sightings of rowan berries have also doubled. Botanist James Wong said the conditions may also lead to tastier berries.

The BBC presenter said: ‘They may be sweeter and more nutrient-dense, due to the high light levels and low rainfall.’

Horticulturalist Bob Flowerdew said the time of ripening depends on the variety of blackberry and location, adding: ‘There is a huge difference between the south and the north of England, and indeed Scotland.

‘Most of my blackberries are well ahead and I have got quite a few varieties.’
