The CEO of ExxonMobile says fossil fuels might be causing the Earth to warm, but says a collaboration of scaremongering environmentalists, 'lazy journalists' and the 'illiterate public' are blowing the problem out of proportion.

Rex Tillerson, who leads the world's largest oil company, believes the true impact of climate change cammot be accurately predicted by scientists. And whatever fallout might come from the, he said, humans will be able to adapt. 

Meanwhile, scientists claim the disastrous effects of global warming are on display across the nation right now, as American celebrate the July Four holiday with record heat, dangerous thunderstorms and the remnants of horrific wildfire still burning in Colorado.

Speaking out: Rex Tillerson admitted that fossil fuels are warming the climate, but called the predictions of disaster 'overblown'

Tillerson dismissed the dire warnings about consequences of possible global warming.

'We have spent our entire existence adapting. We’ll adapt,' he said in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations.

'It’s an engineering problem and there will be an engineering solution.'

He added that the oil industry is capable of providing cheap, reliable and safe energy well into the future.

Fears about spills, environmental contamination and the disastrous effects of global warming are overblown by environmental groups that 'manufacture fear' and 'lazy' journalists who report their findings without checking that the claims are valid, Tillerson said.

Because of this, he said, the industry's biggest challenge is 'taking an illiterate public and try to help them understand why we can manage these risks.'

The comments drew a rebuke from many scientists and environmental groups.

Scientists say the perspective is also refuted by the severe and irregular weather many Americans are currently experiencing.

These are the kinds of extremes climate scientists have predicted will come with climate change, although it cannot be said that climate change is the cause. Nor will researchers say global warming is the reason 3,215 daily high temperature records were set in the month of June.

Scientifically linking individual weather events to climate change takes intensive study, complicated mathematics, computer models and lots of time. Sometimes it isn't caused by global warming. Weather is always variable; freak things happen.

So far this year, more than 2.1 million acres have burned in wildfires, more than 113 million people in the U.S. were in areas under extreme heat advisories last Friday, two-thirds of the country is experiencing drought, and earlier in June, deluges flooded Minnesota and Florida.

'This is what global warming looks like at the regional or personal level,' said Jonathan Overpeck, professor of geosciences and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona.

'The extra heat increases the odds of worse heat waves, droughts, storms and wildfire. This is certainly what I and many other climate scientists have been warning about.'

The abnormal weather will continue on for Independence Day and this weekend.

Temperatures are expected to be ten degrees above normal and climb near 100 in much of the country on Wednesday.

The National Weather Service has issued an excessive heat warning for most of the Midwest, where heat is likely to be 15 degrees above average for this time of year -- up to 104 degrees.

Severe thunderstorms are also predicted for the Great Lakes region.

These weather problems confront a record number of holiday travelers -- an estimated 42 million Americans who are driving or flying more than 50 miles from home to be with family on the Fourth of July.

In Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio, more than one million homes remain without power in sweltering heat after storms pummeled the Mid-Atlantic over the weekend.

Severe drought in some places could curtail fireworks displays. Cities in Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois and Missouri have all passed bans on personal fireworks because of the tinder-box created by lack of rainfall.

The situation in similar in Colorado, where firefighters are only beginning to bring the Waldo Canyon wildfire under control. The blaze razed 18,000 acres and led to the evacuation of 36,000 residents around Colorado Springs.
