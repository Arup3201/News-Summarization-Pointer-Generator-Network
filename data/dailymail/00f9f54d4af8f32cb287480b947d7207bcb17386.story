Stephen Owens was just a child when he testified against his mother, Gaile, who was sentenced to death after hiring a hit man to kill her husband.

For 25 years Mr Owens, who had found his father's brutally beaten body in the family's Memphis home, had shunned his mother but he now says he has learned the power of forgiveness.

He appeared with his mother, who was released on parole in 2011, at a book panel yesterday, to discuss how he came to terms with her crime.

'I was so angry,' he told the Tennessean as he talked about the day his mother was sentenced to death. 'When I walked out of there, I thought to myself that we would never see each other again, if I had my way.'

His mother had hired a contract killer in downtown Memphis, then made sure her and her two young boys were at a relative's house on the night of the crime.

Mr Owens, who was 12 when he discovered his father's body, said: 'When I walked into the house that night I knew something was wrong.'

They had appeared to be a normal Christian family but days after Ronald's murder, Mr Owens' mother was arrested. 'Not only had I lost one parent, I'd lost both,' Mr Owens said.

His mother was found guilty of arranging for her husband to be beaten to death with a tire iron and was set to be the first woman to be executed in Tennessee for more than 180 years.

As she came to terms with her crime and sentence, Owens said she was desperate for contact from her two sons and family.

'I can remember months and years, birthdays and holidays, just wanting one card, and they didn’t come,' she said.

The 61-year-old, whose execution had been scheduled for September 2010, finally had her death sentence commuted to life and she was released on parole in 2011.

Supporters of the grandmother had urged 
her release, claiming she was a battered wife who didn't use that 
defense because she didn't want her young sons to know about the 
physical and sexual abuse.

The first thing the grandmother did after being freed was to hug her son. It was the moment that had kept her going through all her years in prison. 

'I knew 
that there was still hope that one day I would see Stephen, and one day I
would be able to tell him I did wrong, and that I was sorry,' she said.

The pair had had no contact for decades but, as Mr Owens' resentment and anger slowly started to fade, he finally visited her in jail in 2009, 24 years after last seeing her in a Tennessee courtroom.

He made the decision to see her after a fellow teacher at the Nashville school he was working in told Mr Owens he had been working with his mother in jail.

At their reunion in the women's prison where she was being held, Owens was finally able to tell her son how sorry she was.

'She told me she couldn't change anything but that she was sorry,' Mr Owens told BH Publishing.

New beginning: Gaile Owens leaves prison in 2011 after her death sentence was commuted to life and a parole board agreed to release her

He put his ability to forgive his mother down to time and faith, adding: 'Every step, that anger and resentment 
releases.'

His path to forgiveness has been documented in the book Set Free, co-authored by Ken Abraham, and their story was described by former Tennessean editor John Seigenthaler as going 'to the heart of what a caring, loving, all-embracing society we can be'.

Mr Owens said: 'I realized mother and I both needed to be set free, my mother from the walls of prison, and me from years of resentment.'
