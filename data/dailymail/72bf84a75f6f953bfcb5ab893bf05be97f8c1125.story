A Royalist pensioner is furious after being told to remove Union flags from his home which he put up to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee.

Patriotic Derek Birch, 72, has hung 14 flags outside his house in Newmarket, Suffolk,  to celebrate the Queen’s 60 years on the throne.

He hangs a flag on his property every year to celebrate the Queen’s birthday and draped his house with flags for the Royal wedding last year.

But his housing association have sent him a letter complaining the number of flags, which measure 3ft by 5ft, is 'excessive' and causing damage to the property.

The letter from Landlords Flagship Housing states: 'The way in which they are being displayed has caused damage to our property.'

It warns Mr Birch to take the flags down or pay for the cost of their removal.

'It’s ridiculous, I can’t see how the flags are causing any damage. It’s a very special year which only happens once in a lifetime and I wanted to show my support.

'I think the Royal family are doing a great job and I’m a big supporter of the Queen. I think it’s a huge insult to ask me to take the flags down.

'If I can’t fly my own country’s flag what is the world coming to?' he said.

He added how none of his neighbours had complained about the flags, which have been up for about a month.

There are six on the front of the house, four on the sides and four on the back.

'I always celebrate Royal occasions and put a flag on my house on the Queen’s birthday and St George’s day.

'The flags look bright and colourful and aren’t causing any harm to anyone. I wish I could have put up 60 flags,' he said.

Birch revealed that Birch intends to take them all down as soon as the Jubilee celebrations were over.

A spokeswoman for Flagship Housing, which manages 21,500 homes in East Anglia, said: 'Two community managers visited our customer last Friday to advise Mr Birch that due to complaints received about the flags, they would have to be removed.

'Permission had not been sought to display these flags to the outside of the building which includes fixtures to our brickwork.

'Not only were there an excessive number of flags attached to the outside of the maisonette, but the size of the flags was also an issue.

'Flagship is happy for customers to celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee but activities should not be to the detriment of neighbours and the wider community.'
