During her Spice Girls heyday she was dubbed the ‘Scary’ one and it appears Melanie Brown lived up to her moniker.

The singer turned X Factor judge has revealed she and fellow band member Melanie C, who was branded ‘Sporty’, had a ‘few punch ups’.

Asked if they ever did any damage to each other, she replied: ‘Oh, nothing. Maybe a split lip, that’s all. Me and Melanie would irritate each other. It would always start off with a shove not a punch.

‘Mel C’s pretty hard. And if she let rip…but then two seconds later we’d be rolling around laughing going, ‘Oh you silly bugger.’’

Elaborating on her wild times with her fellow Spice Girls, Miss Brown revealed she and Geri Halliwell liked driving down the motorway topless and they all enjoyed clubbing and drinking.

The Spice Girls started as a five-piece and between 1996 and 1998 released eight chart-topping singles.

In total they have sold over 75 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling female group of all time.

Miss Brown is now 39, a mother of three and married to her second husband Stephen Belafonte and now a popular judge on Simon Cowell’s ITV X Factor judge.

But in a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian’s Weekend magazine she defended her sexuality and opened up about her four year romance with Christa Parker, a mother with children who attended the same Los Angeles school as her eldest daughter Phoenix, now 15.

She said: ‘I had a girlfriend. So what? I did have a four-year relationship with a woman. ‘People call me lesbian, bisexual or heterosexual, but I know who’s in my bed...’

She dismissed suggestions she is in an aopen relationship with Belafonte and said: ‘‘No, me and my husband are very tight and solid.’

Miss Brown also revealed she is now good friends with Hollywood actor Eddie Murphy, who is the father of her second daughter Angel, following a turbulent relationship with him. Miss Brown was forced to take a paternity test to prove Angel is his daughter. She said: ‘We go over there [US] as a family, we have dinners together, everything is fine…now.

‘He’s a great guy. Look, we fell in love with each other , we had a gorgeous child together. Some of my friends don’t even see their exes and they’ve got kids together.’
