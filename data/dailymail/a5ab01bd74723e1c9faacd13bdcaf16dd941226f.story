Police are appealing for information after a Middlesbrough fan was alleged to have made a racist gesture toward Blackburn Rovers striker Rudy Gestede.

The FA are already investigating the incident at the end of the Championship match between the sides on November 29 after referee Mark Clattenburg included it in his official report.

Gestede scored five minutes into added time at the end of the Riverside Stadium encounter to earn Blackburn a 1-1 draw but after the final whistle he reacted angrily to something he heard from the crowd.

Gestede was pictured doing a monkey action in attempt to mimic the gesture allegedly directed toward him from the stand.

A spokeswoman for Cleveland Police said: 'The incident took place as the players were applauding the away fans on the pitch at the final whistle at around 5pm.

A Middlesbrough fan in the East Stand in block 40-42 was seen to make a gesture towards a Blackburn Rovers player which was perceived as racist and a complaint was made to police.'

Anyone with information regarding the identity of the suspect is asked to contact PC Chris Hilton on the non-emergency number 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
