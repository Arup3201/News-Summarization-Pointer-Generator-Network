'Our son was the light of our lives, an artist with a beautiful mind and spirit.' 

His mother Mia, a five-time world boxing champion, wrote in a statement posted on Sqor Sports, a social media website for athletes and reposted to her Twitter account. 

'He fought long and hard against an illness for which there is no cure.'

'Unfortunately, the pain became too great for him and I dare not say he lost the battle – he simply chose to set himself free. 

'My fight for mental health will continue. They may not find a cure in my lifetime, but we can try and prevent the loss of another beautiful soul.'

His parents, who are now divorced and have a daughter Paris, said his funeral will be held in Westlake, California, on December 5, which would have been Julian's 25th birthday. 

In a 2013 profile on Julian's art, the Huffington Post noted that Julian had been diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 18. 

'Julian knows what it is like to feel lonely, off-kilter and claustrophobic. He has endured bouts of severe depression since he was a child. 

Fame: Kristoff St. John is best known for his role as Neil Winters on the US drama The Young and the Restless

'And for a stretch of time in the recent past he was homeless, sleeping in the bathrooms of public parks and occasionally in motels. He has battled addiction issues and has had scrapes with the law.

On Monday Mia wrote on her Twitter page: 'While nothing can remove our pain at the moment, we find solace in your messages and knowing how much our son, Julian St. John was loved.'

Julian's website references his troubled state of mind in his bio: 'Julian would spend countless hours writing and drawing. He was a troubled youth who found solace in his art.

'Eventually he left high school early and was able to hone his skills as an artist. 

'His eccentricity and flamboyant ways found a home in his art.

'What doctors found as "troublesome," he found as his story. A complex, but extraordinary young man, Julian, takes you through his journey of psychosis in each piece of art. It's a story of despair and triumph, where reality and delusion become intertwined.'

Mia, who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks, takes medication and has been in therapy for years.

She campaigns against the stigmas associated with mental health disorders and and joined calls for $200 million to fund more mental-health counselors in public schools.
