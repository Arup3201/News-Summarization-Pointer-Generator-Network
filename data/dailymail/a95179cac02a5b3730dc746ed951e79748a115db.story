The Deputy Speaker is understood to be facing a fourth allegation of sexual assault after a former intern claimed Nigel Evans groped him in a Commons bar.

Police investigating allegations against the Ribble Valley MP have asked for a formal statement from the 22-year-old former parliamentary intern, who claims Evans groped his bottom for around a minute in the Sports and Social Club bar in December 2011.

The man, who is now working outside of Parliament, said he had never spoken to Evans and that he was in the bar with his parents when the alleged incident occurred.

'Incredulity': Deputy Speaker and Ribble Valley MP Nigel Evans is understood to be facing a fourth sexual assault claim

He said he stopped at the bar for a drink with his parents after showing them around parliament, according to a report in the Guardian.

While there, Evans stood with his back to the former parliamentary intern and groped him for around 60 seconds, the man claims.

A spokesman for the Deputy Speaker told the Guardian he was unaware of the complaint and 'vigorously denies' any wrongdoing.

His office is yet to respond to the MailOnline's request for comment.

The allegation comes after Evans was arrested on May 4 over claims he raped one man and sexually assaulted another between 2009 and 2013.

The 55-year-old Conservative politician has branded the accusations 'completely false'.

Denying the allegations in a statement read outside his home after he was released on bail, Evans told of his 'incredulity' at being arrested over claims made by two men he had until then 'regarded as friends'.

A third alleged victim then gave a statement to Lancashire Constabulary.

On May 20 Evans' parliamentary offices were searched by detectives who were granted a warrant by a judge at Preston Crown Court.

Officers seized 'parliamentary 
material' from the deputy speaker's offices at Westminster during the 
search, which was carried out with the knowledge of Speaker John Bercow.

Mr Bercow said in a statement to MPs that the warrant related to 'the investigation of a serious arrestable offence'.

Evans has been relieved of his duties chairing Commons debates until the police inquiries have concluded.

A Lancashire Police spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'It is an ongoing police investigation and we won't be providing any further comment.'

The House of Commons said it would not comment on an ongoing police investigation.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
