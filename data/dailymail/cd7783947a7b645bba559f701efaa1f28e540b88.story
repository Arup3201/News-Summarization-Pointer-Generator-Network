Bombs continued to rain down on the Syrian city of Homs for a fourth day today, as President Bashar Assad stepped up his efforts to put down a popular uprising against his regime.

Government troops used rocket launchers, tanks and machine guns to kill 95 yesterday - following Friday's bloody massacre of 200 and the blowing up a makeshift medical centre and two oil pipelines.

Today's renewed attack came as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in Damascus to meet Assad to discuss ways to try to end the uprising.

Lavrov began the one-day talks by telling Assad that Moscow wants Arab people to 'live in peace and harmony'.

He is reported as saying: 'Every leader of every country must be aware of his share of responsibility. You are aware of yours. It is in our interests for Arab peoples to live in peace and agreement.'

The remarks may be intended to prompt Assad to take steps to end 11 months of bloodshed which most of the world blames largely on his government.

Russia has said Assad's opponents must also share responsibility for the violence.   

His visit comes days after Syrian allies Russia and China vetoed a resolution at the United Nations that would have condemned the crackdown on dissent and called on him to transfer some of his powers to his deputy.

The Syrian government had also rejected the Arab plan as intervention in internal affairs.

Prime Minister David Cameron today chaired a meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the deteriorating situation in Syria.

The meeting came as European Union states began work on a new round of sanctions against the Middle Eastern country, expected to be agreed on February 27.

That could include a freeze on Syria's central bank assets and a ban on trade in precious metals.

Ahead of the NSC meeting, Foreign Secretary William Hague briefed Cabinet on developments following Russia and China's veto of a United Nations resolution designed to end President Bashar Assad's bloody crackdown on dissent.

Lavrov was greeted by a convoy as it 
ran along the Mazzeh boulevard among a sea of Assad supporters who 
turned up to express gratitude for Moscow's support.

One supporter, 45-year-old Manya 
Abbad, said: 'I am here to thank Russia for its stand in the face of the
world conspiracy against Syria.

'I wish the Arabs adopted similar 
stances.'

The total 
death toll since March 2011 now stands at more than 5,400.

Authorities say they are fighting 'terrorists' keen on dividing and 
sabotaging the country.

Mohammad al-Hassan, an activist in Homs,
said: 'The bombardment is again concentrating on Bab Amro.

'A doctor 
tried to get in there this morning but I heard he was wounded.

'There is no electricity and all communication with the neighbourhood has been cut.'

Police in Berlin have today arrested two Syrians they accuse of spying for the Assad regime on opposition members to be earmarked for assassination.

German police said the suspected agents were collating information on opponents of Assad.  

The homes of six people suspected of aiding the agents were being searched this morning as the men were taken into custody.

The suspected spies were only identified as 47-year-old Mahmoud el-A, and 34-year-old Akram O.

Media reports said the duo and their safe-house assistants had been under the observation of intelligence agencies for some time.  

Some 70 police and intelligence officials were involved in the arrests.

Syria,
a majority Sunni Muslim nation, has been since 1970 under the rule of 
the Assad family from the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite 
Islam.   

Moscow has previously vetoed a resolution against Syria at the United Nations Security Council. 

Catherine
al-Talli, a senior member of the opposition Syrian National Council, 
said the attack on Homs was aimed to show Moscow that Assad was in 
control and he could serve until his term expires in 2014.   

Talli
said: 'Assad needs to look strong in front of the Russians. He has not 
managed to control Homs since the eruption of the uprising.

'Now that he has seen that he faces no real threat from the international community it appears that he wants to finish off the city.

'There are live television feeds from Bab Amro and the whole world can see indiscriminate shelling of civilians. This has not stopped him.'

And Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the Security Council veto a 'fiasco'.

He said his country cannot remain 
silent about the massacres in Syria and will continue to support the 
Arab League efforts. And he added: 'We will launch a new initiative with
countries that stand by the Syrian people instead of the regime.'

It was not clear what kind of steps Turkey might be planning.

But U.S. Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton has called for 'friends of democratic Syria' to unite and rally 
against Assad's regime, previewing the possible formation of a group of 
like-minded nations to coordinate assistance to the Syrian opposition 
from outside the UN.

Support: British Foreign Secretary William Hague said help would be provided to the rebels

Yesterday Britain said it would send 
equipment to help the opposition oust Assad.

Foreign Secretary William Hague announced plans for a dramatic escalation of support for the rebels and said  
there was 'no limit on what resources we can provide'.

He
ruled out British military action but said the UK is poised to provide 
'strategic communications' equipment to help different rebel groups work
together against the 'murderous' regime.

Diplomatic sources compared the situation to the war in Libya.

And
they said Britain will seek to provide radios and mobile phones and 
work with Turkey and other neighbouring nations to allow rebels to 
broadcast radio programmes into Syria.

The UK will also back fresh European Union sanctions later this month designed to 'fracture the regime'.

That will see a new crackdown on activities by the Syrian Central Bank and imposing travel bans and asset freezes on regime officials to encourage them to abandon Assad.

Mr Hague recalled the British ambassador to Syria yesterday for talks as violence erupted again, which prompted the  U.S. to withdraw all its embassy staff for security reasons.

The U.S. Embassy in Amman has also warned American citizens not to travel to Syria and is recommending that anybody in the country leave immediately.

The French, Italian and Spanish foreign ministries have also said they were recalling their ambassadors to Syria for consultations because of the continued crackdown. But the countries said their embassies in Damascus would remain open.

In a statement to the Commons, Mr Hague denounced Russia and China after they vetoed a UN Security Council resolution condemning the violence.

Western diplomats are furious with Russia and China, arguing that they bent over backwards in rewriting the resolution so it could not be construed as a precursor to military action – and they still refused to sign it.

Mr Hague accused Russia and China of 'betraying the Syrian people'. He said: 'The human suffering in Syria is already unimaginable and is in grave danger of escalating further.

'They chose to side with the Syrian regime and implicitly to leave the door open to further abuses by them. They did so while President Assad’s tanks were encircling Homs and shells were pounding the homes of Syrian civilians.'

Mr Hague said the Assad regime cannot survive. His thoughts are echoed by U.S. President Barack Obama, who said the Syrian leader's departure was only a matter of time.

Casualties: YouTube footage shows the bodies of three people reportedly 
killed in shelling on Rastan in the central province of Homs.

He told NBC: 'We have been relentless in sending a message that it is time for Assad to go.'This is not going to be a matter of if, it's going to be a matter of when.'

And Hague told MPs: 'This is a doomed regime as well as a murdering regime. There is no way it can recover its credibility internationally or with its own people.'

In a bid to shame Russia and China, the UK and other countries are planning to pass a resolution condemning the violence in the UN’s General Assembly, where vetoes cannot be used.

The UK will also beef up a diplomatic team under Francis Guy, who is an unofficial ambassador to the Syrian opposition, to 'intensify' those contacts.

The team will work to get the Syrian opposition groups to agree a common platform, just as rebels did in Libya.

Mr Hague also announced plans for a new contact group to help the Arab League plan to end the bloodshed

It will see the EU, the Arab League and other countries come together to ‘co-ordinate intensified diplomatic and economic pressure on the regime, and to engage with Syrian opposition groups committed to a democratic future’.
