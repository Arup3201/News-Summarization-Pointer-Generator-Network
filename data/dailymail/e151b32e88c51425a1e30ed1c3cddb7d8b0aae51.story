A mother-of-two says she rediscovered true love when she remarried her husband after 24 years apart.

After divorcing her first husband Chris Jackson, 62, in 1985, Ann Jackson, 57, remarried and had two children.

But after the second marriage ended, an encounter with a long-forgotten photograph of her first wedding prompted Mrs Jackson, of Sheffield, to reconnect with him.

Reunited: Ann and Chris Jackson at their second wedding. Ann says she has rediscovered true love now she has finally remarried Chris Jackson after 24 years apart

She said: 'I looked at the photograph and I was taken straight back to my first wedding. We looked so happy.

'I'd never fallen out of love with Chris. Even though our first wedding was wonderful, our second was a lot more meaningful because we realised that fate brought us back together.'

Mrs Jackson, who works for a high street clothing retailer, first fell for for Mr Jackson, a tyre fitter, when they met at a wedding in 1973.

Mrs Jackson said: 'He followed me around all night. We were instantly attracted to each other."  Soon the pair were spending every weekend together. Mrs Jackson said: 'I moved to Chris's home in Wrexham when I was 19 and two years later, in 1979, we married.

First time around: Ann and Chris cut the cake at their first wedding in 1979 - they went their separate ways in 1990 sue to 'circumstances'

Long lost love: After the second marriage ended, an encounter with a long-forgotten photograph of her first wedding prompted Mrs Jackson to reconnect with him - Chris said he had never loved a woman like her

'My family were over the moon I was marrying Chris. My mum adored him.

'I have very fond memories of our first wedding. After the ceremony we took the wedding party to the local bierkeller, the hofbrauhaus, for a celebration. The club's photographer was walking around taking pictures, but although we sat for a photo, we decided not to buy any pictures from him.'

Mr and Mrs Jackson set up home in Wrexham but after seven years of marriage, things fell apart. Mrs Jackson said: 'I was a city girl at heart and missed the nightlife and company of my home town of Sheffield.

'Chris worked for his father's haulage company which kept him away driving trucks for weeks at a time. By the end, we were barely talking to each other. Chris couldn't abandon his family business, but I wasn't happy so I decided on divorce. Circumstances had driven us apart.'

Changed man: Speaking about seeing Chris again, Mrs Jackson said: 'He looked completely different. But his eyes were the same and looking at them I was instantly taken back'

Family: Ann's children, Joshua, now 23, and Ellie, 17, at Ann and Chris's second wedding - where Josh gave her away

Mrs Jackson remarried in 1990 and would go on to have two children, Joshua, now 23, and Ellie, 17. But she said her first husband was never far from her thoughts. She said: 'My family still talked about Chris a lot. He stayed a big part of my life, even though we weren't in contact any more.'

Mrs Jackson's second marriage ended in divorce after 19 years and in 2009 she returned to Sheffield where she bumped into the wife of the former head doorman of the local beer house.

She said: 'She was headed to the launch of a book which had old photos of events there. I decided to buy a copy.  The book included one of the images taken by the roaming photographer who had been on duty the night of Mr and Mrs Jackson's first wedding.

Mrs Jackson said: 'I'd never seen the photo before and I couldn't help but smile. We were so happy and carefree. I realised I'd always loved Chris.

'My sister still had Chris's number. We tried it and, amazingly, it still worked. I hadn't spoken to Chris for years and my stomach was full of butterflies.

All together now: From left, Ann's son Joshua, Ann's aunt Margaret, Chris, Ann's daughter Ellie and Ann

'He kept repeating, "I can't believe 
it's you". He asked me if I was married and I said I was divorced, and 
he was glad about that. I filled him in on the path my life had taken.'

Three
 days later, Mr Jackson turned up on her doorstep. Mrs Jackson said: 'He
 looked completely different. He'd lost his long, jet black hair. He 
wore glasses and he seemed to have shrunk. But his eyes were the same 
and looking at them I was instantly taken back.'

Three
 weeks later he asked her to remarry him. Mrs Jackson said: 'Chris told 
me I was the only woman he'd ever loved and he would never get married 
again unless it was to me. He got down on one knee and asked me to marry
 him again.'

Mrs Jackson's children, who gave her away at their second wedding in April 2011, now live with Mr and Mrs Jackson in Sheffield. She said: 'Joshua and Ellie love Chris to bits and he would drop everything and do anything for them.

'We were meant to be together. It was true love, and it still is. My second marriage gave me my two beautiful children, and I'm so happy they were ecstatic about me marrying Chris.

'Our life is wonderful. There have been some ups and downs along the way but I'm exactly where I want to be now.

'It's hard to believe that one picture changed my life so much. It's the kind of thing you read about happening to other people. But it actually happened to me.'
