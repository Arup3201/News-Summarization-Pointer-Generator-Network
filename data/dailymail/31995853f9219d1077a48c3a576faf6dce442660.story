An episode of a popular children's show has apparently been pulled off the air after disgusted parents noticed cartoonists had drawn a picture of a pair of bare breasts into a scene.

Oggy and the Cockroaches is a French animated comedy series produced by Xilam and Gaumont Film Company and which airs on the Nickelodeon children's TV cartoon channel NickToons.

But the comedy has caused fury among some parents after an episode showed a framed picture of a topless lady showing off her assets.

An episode of popular children's TV show Oggy and the Cockroaches has been pulled from the air after angry parents complained about this scene (pictured) which shows a topless woman in a picture in the  background

The busty topless cartoon character - who appears to be a duck  blessed with an enormous bosom - was in the background of an episode which aired in the US on March 5.

She also sports a pair of tiny bikini briefs, giant sunglasses and a bouffant hair-do.

The NickToons US website now appears to have removed the show from both its schedule and the show's homepage, although some character's 'profile pages' remain live.

But TV schedules for the next few days show other episodes are still billed to air in the US.

NickToons UK and Ireland began airing the show in September last year and shows new episodes every weekend morning.

It is unclear if the show will also be removed from the air in Britain.

One father told TMZ his child spotted the pair of breasts on his faourite show and was 'extremely unhappy' about it - particularly has he was forced to have an chat about anatomy with his 8-year-old son. 

MailOnline has contacted Nickelodeon and Xilam for a comment. 

Many viewers have taken to social media to discuss 'boobgate'.

Hedda G wrote: 'Of course the image was inappropriate. That being said an eight year old boy is in 3rd grade. He should know about breasts. The little guy should have a basic understanding.'

Christine added: 'Cartoonists have been doing this c*** for ages especially Disney. Parents still take their kids to Disney cartoons. Other things to worry about people.' 

Megan Mayhew wrote on Facebook: 'Ok so it's ok for women to breastfeed in public but a cartoon of boobs is horrible. If an eight year old has never noticed women have boobs than I'm glad his dad had a talk with him. Stop making the naked body so taboo.'

Selina Fraley said: 'Wait so the father was concerned about the boobs in the background but not the filth that his kids was watching I mean, the characters were poisoning each other and lit eachother on fire! But you're worried about cartoon breasts smh get your priorities straight.'
