Arsenal broke the habit of a lifetime on Sunday, winning an away game against one of their top-four rivals.

Their 2-0 win over Manchester City could well be a watershed moment in the Gunners' stuttering season.

But what was different about Arsene Wenger's side at the Etihad Stadium and what lessons can they learn going into future clashes against their direct rivals?

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger got his side's tactics spot on as they won 2-0 away at Manchester City

1) DISCIPLINE AND CONCENTRATION

Throwing away leads in search of more goals has been an unwanted characteristic of Arsenal's season so far. Conceding a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht in the Champions League has been one of the low-lights of their campaign. But there was no gung-ho approach against City. Having taken the lead through Santi Cazorla's penalty, the Gunners were much more conservative, remaining compact, not trying to stretch the game as they stifled City's attack.

2) KILLING THE GAME

It's not, perhaps, in keeping with Arsenal's attacking mantra but they showed guile and know-how of getting over the line at the Etihad. Time wasting in the corners, passing the ball sideways and backwards all wastes valuable seconds when you are ahead in a game. We don't usually see Arsenal lower themselves to that sort of thing. But they did on Sunday and came away with the best win of the season so far. Lesson learned.

3) FRANCIS COQUELIN - MIDFIELD ENFORCER

Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out defensive midfielder all season. It looks like they have found one in Coquelin. The young Frenchman was instrumental against City. Breaking up play in midfield and passing the ball to those who can do damage. Whether Coquelin is the answer to the Gunners midfield conundrum in the long term remains to be seen. But, for the time being, Wenger looks to have the midfield enforcer he has been desperate for.

4) MIXING IT UP

We all know Arsenal can pass the ball as well as most teams in Europe, but they showed a different side to their game on Sunday. Goalkeeper David Ospina's long balls into centre forward Olivier Giroud was a feature of the Gunners' game plan. Is it a shame Wenger's side were forced to part with their passing principles? Perhaps. But Arsenal supporters certainly won't be concerned about that this morning.

5) HAPPY NOT TO HAVE THE BALL

Arsenal are most comfortable with the ball at their feet; when they dictating play. But on Sunday they had just 35 per cent of possession - but came away with a 2-0 win. Figure that one out? You don't always have to control the pace of a game to win it, as the Gunners proved as they stifled City's attack. They showed efficiency in their counter-attacks against Manuel Pellegrini's side. They had three shots on target - two of which were goals.
