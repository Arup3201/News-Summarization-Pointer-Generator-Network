Staggered: Lesley Cherry came back from holiday to find she was wanted by police

A mother came back from holiday to find she was wanted by police – over her garden decking.

Lesley Cherry was staggered to find a warrant had been issued for her arrest because she had failed to get planning permission for the wooden verandah.

And while she was away council workers had demolished the ‘unneighbourly’ decking on the back of her £350,000 home, leaving her garden like a building site.

A note put through Mrs Cherry’s letter box warned: ‘You are now circulated as wanted on the police national computer – failure to contact could result in your immediate arrest.’

Mrs Cherry, a mother of three, said: ‘I was gobsmacked when I found out about the warrant. You would think, given what has happened, that I was some master criminal, not a householder who’s made a mistake with the planning permission.

‘I’ve never been in trouble in my life and I’ve never even stepped foot in a court.

‘I think this is pathetic that it has got so far. The council have been heavy-handed jobsworths. All this for a bit of decking. It’s nonsense.’

In November, Mrs Cherry, 46, and her husband Simon, 42, decided to put up a decked viewing area on the back of their house in Stockport, as their steeply sloping garden meant their children wanted somewhere flat to play.

The decking, which cost £4,500, also let the couple enjoy the surrounding countryside.

But they failed to apply for planning permission and neighbours complained the decking let them look directly into their gardens and homes.

Karen Hillen, prosecuting, told magistrates in Stockport: ‘It was a considerable and substantial decking area.

Mrs Cherry, from Stockport, was told a warrant had been issued 
for her arrest and her details were on the police national computer

'The officer was satisfied that planning permission was needed and had not been applied for  and it was likely that would be unneighbourly.

‘It caused serious overlooking of the adjacent garden and looked into the adjacent rear bedrooms.’

In December, Stockport council ordered the couple to remove the decking – which, at more that 12 inches off the ground, breached strict planning rules – by March.

But the couple, who are in the process of getting divorced, failed to do so.

Measure: Stockport council said the decking was 'completely unneighbourly' because it was raised more than 30cm above the ground

They claimed to have ‘too much on their plate’ after burglars broke into their home and stole  thousands of pounds worth of electrical goods.

They also missed a court hearing last month, where warrants were issued for their arrest.

Yesterday the couple appeared in court and were fined almost £1,450 after pleading guilty to failing to comply with an enforcement notice which required they take the decking down.

They were also told to pay £437 costs and face a further £1,500 bill from the local authority for the cost of removing the decking.

Mr Cherry, who runs a car security business, had responded to the warrant, which was withdrawn before yesterday’s proceedings.

Mrs Cherry and husband Simon, 41, had put up decking without planning permission

He said: ‘We had no idea when we set up the decking that it would be infringing the planning policy.

‘Unfortunately, we had a lot on our plate which meant that we couldn’t get anything done in time. The council just came and took it down.

‘I accept that it does overlook next door’s garden, there is no dispute in that.

‘He saw us putting it up and then made a complaint because we didn’t put fencing up.

‘With the break-in and the divorce which we are going through it was just one of those things.’

Councillor Iain Roberts, of Stockport Council, said that officials had made several attempts to contact the Cherrys to get  them to comply with the enforcement notice.

He added: ‘As the harm caused by the development was so severe, we had no option other than to carry out the steps required by the notice.’
