Lance Armstrong believes he should be given the opportunity to compete again, saying: 'I deserve to be punished. I'm not sure that I deserve a death penalty.'

The 41-year-old Texan has confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs during all seven of his Tour de France victories. He was stripped of all results from August 1, 1998 and banned from sport for life.

Armstrong was competing in triathlons, mountain bike events and marathons before he was sanctioned and believes he deserves that opportunity in the future, suggesting a life ban is not right.

Part two: On day one Armstrong admitted his doping - on day two he spoke about the effect on his family

Emotion: The only point where Armstrong showed emotion was when talking about his children - Isabella, Grace and his son Luke. Armstrong also has two more children from a second partner

He told Oprah Winfrey in the second 
part of their television interview: 'I can't lie to you. I'd love the 
opportunity to be able to compete, but that isn't the reason that I'm 
doing this.

'Frankly, this might not be the most popular answer, but I think I deserve it (to be able to compete again).

'I deserve to be punished. I'm not sure that I deserve a death penalty.'

Eleven of Armstrong's former team-mates provided evidence against him in exchange for six-month suspensions.

He added: 'If you look at the 
situation, if you look at that culture, you look at the sport, you see 
the punishments. I could go back to that time... you're trading my story
for a six-month suspension. That's what people got. What everybody got.

'I got a death penalty. I'm not saying that that's unfair, necessarily, but I'm saying it's different.'

After years of denials, Armstrong 
confirmed that during his record run, from 1999 to 2005, he used 
blood-boosting agent EPO, blood doping, testosterone, cortisone and 
human growth hormone.

Armstrong, who was last October 
stripped of all results dating from August 1, 1998 and banned from sport
for life, denied doping during his comeback from retirement in 2009, 
when he finished third in the Tour, and 2010 and refuted suggestions he 
paid off cycling's world governing body, the UCI, to cover up a positive
test in 2001.

In hindsight he wishes he had 
co-operated with the United States Anti-Doping Agency investigation 
which proved his downfall. Co-operation could have meant a lesser 
penalty.

Regrets? Armstrong wished he had confessed earlier so his punishment was lesser

Armstrong's long-time sponsors each 
deserted him in quick succession following the publication of the USADA 
report, but the most challenging moment was when his own Lance Armstrong
Foundation, the charity known now as Livestrong, distanced itself from 
him.

'The foundation is like my sixth child
and to make that decision, and to step aside, was big,' said Armstrong,
who expressed his wish the charity can thrive without being associated 
with him.

Mixed reviews: Some said Oprah's interviewing style was excellent while others wish she pushed Armstrong further

'I wouldn't at all say [I was] forced out, told to leave. I was aware of the pressure.

'It was the best thing for our organisation, but it hurt like hell. That was the lowest [moment].'

Asked if he feels disgraced, Armstrong said: 'Of course, but I also feel humbled. I feel ashamed. This is ugly stuff.

'It's a process. And I think we're at the beginning of the process.'

Deceit: Armstrong 'won' the Tour de France seven times, all of which came with the help of drugs

Armstrong confirmed he has been undergoing therapy to deal with his demons.

His competitive desire remains, though. Asked whether he believes his life ban should be overturned, he said: 'Selfishly, yes. But realistically I don't think that's going to happen. And I have to live with that.'

Winfrey asked Armstrong 'Did anyone know the whole truth?' He replied 'Yeah,' but there was no follow-up to ascertain who.

Armstrong says he returned to cycling in 2009 and 2010 having agreed not to use performance-enhancing drugs again, yet evidence in the USADA report points to the contrary. He maintains the last time he doped was during his 2005 Tour de France win.

Disgraced: Armstrong has admitted his history is 'ugly stuff'

Armstrong was emotional when discussing his 13-year-old son Luke, with tears welling up in his eyes and hesitated in giving answers, his voice croaking.

He had discovered Luke was defending him at school and had to address the matter.

Armstrong said: 'That's when I knew I had to tell him. He'd never asked me. He'd never said "Dad, is this true?" He trusted me. He heard about it in the hallways.

Don't defend me any more: Armstrong held back tears as he recalled talking to his son

'I said "Don't defend me anymore". I said "If anyone says anything to you, do not defend me. Just say my dad said he was sorry".

'He said "look, I love you, you're my dad, this won't change that".

'Thank God he's more like Kristin (Armstrong's first wife and Luke's mother).'

Emotional: Armstrong was close to tears when he explained how he admitted his cheating to children Luke, Grace and Isabella

The Oprah Winfrey Network insisted Armstrong did not receive a fee for the interview and was not offered one.

Yet money is a concern after his sponsors departed. His admission has exposed him to numerous lawsuits, too.

'I've lost all future income,' he said. 'I don't like thinking about it, but that was a 75million-dollar day. Gone. And probably never coming back.'

Armstrong denied claims he attempted to make a payment to USADA.

He said: 'I had no knowledge of that, but I've asked around. I think the claim was 250,000 dollars. That's a lot of money. I would know. That is not true.'
