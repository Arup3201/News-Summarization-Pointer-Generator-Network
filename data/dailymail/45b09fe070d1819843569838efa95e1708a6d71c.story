Aston Villa have opened discussions with Valencia over left-back Aly Cissokho.

Manager Paul Lambert needs re-inforcements after loaning Spaniard Antonio Luna to Hellas Verona and missing out on a loan for Ryan Bertrand who moved to Southampton.

Premier League return? Former Liverpool loanee Aly Cissokho is wanted by Aston Villa

Attracting interest: Villa are in talks with Valencia over the £3million-rated left-back

Cissokho performed well while on loan at Liverpool against Villa last season but had too many defensive lapses for Brendan Rodgers to consider making the deal permanent.

The 26-year-old made 19 appearances for the Anfield club and has two years left on his contract. He could move for around £3million.

If Cissokho signs he would become the fourth player signed by Villa manager Paul Lambert this window, following the arrivals of Joe Cole, Phillipe Senderos and Kieran Richardson.
