German shepherds were bred specifically for their high levels of intelligence and as a result are commonly used as police and guard dogs around the world.

However their desire to learn, which clearly overpowers their desire to just accept what is, can sometimes lead them to become a source of amusement, as this dog's owner recently found out.

Filmed in a garden, the German Shepherd named Sonja stares down at its shadow being cast on the floor before giving its owner and his friends a laugh.

Wagging its tail, the dog initially seems to try and lose its shadow by hopping around and making a sharp turn.

As it gets back to its original position it realises that the shadow is still there, and it stamps on it with its left paw.

Suddenly the German shepherd leaps into the air and jumps down onto the shadow, before hopping three more times in quick succession.

The German Shepherd called Sonja later jumps onto the shadow three more times in quick succession 

The people standing around watching can be heard laughing and one of them notes: ‘He’s playing with the shadow. He sees the shadow.’

The dog then circles its shadow once more, as if deciding on the most strategic plan of action – its tongue sticks out in concentration.

Before leaping into the air – leaving the ground with all four legs – and landing back down onto it several more times.

The video concludes with the dog eventually losing its shadow by moving out of the sun and into the shade.

The hilarious video was recorded in Warsaw, Poland in what appears to be the owner’s garden.
