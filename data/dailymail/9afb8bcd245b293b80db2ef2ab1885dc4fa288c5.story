As the old saying goes, the grass is always greener on the other side.

But in the south-western city of Chengdu, China, there is an element of truth, because city officials have been painting the grassy verges a rich shade of green.

Maintenance teams have been filmed by Chinese reporters using a type of paint called Top Green Turf Greening Agent, it has been reported.

But the 'non toxic' dye has reportedly turned some residents' shoes green as they walk across the city's newly spruced up municipal lawns

Some residents have found the dye - described as completely 'non toxic' - has turned their shoes green as they walk across the city's newly spruced up municipal lawns, the Telegraph reports.

Mr Yang, a salesman for Top Green, the makers of the dye, told the paper: 'We have been selling it to the Chengdu government for at least five or six years, and we have lots of other government clients, like the city of Tianjin, and many north western provinces.'

The company website claims it lasts for ten to 14 weeks, is not washed away by the rain, and also turns the soil green.

Officials have said people feel more 'positive, cheerful and productive when Spring is here and everything is green and new'

The landscaping department has declined to comment on the use of the dye.

But they told Chinese journalists that the chemical was a type of nutrient used to help keep the grass alive during winter.

It is not the first time China has gone to lengths to improve the country's aesthetic appearance.

In the past fields of crops have been replanted to give a more 'fertile appearance' during an inspection tour of the countryside by Chairman Mao, and fake sheep have been positioned on the dried out grasslands of Inner Mongolia to dupe tourists that the animals were still grazing there.
