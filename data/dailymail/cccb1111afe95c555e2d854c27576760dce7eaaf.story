Margaret Hodge said new laws are needed to provide a meaningful deterrent for those setting up tax avoidance schemes

The law should be changed to put the ‘shameless’ £2billion tax avoidance industry out of business, the head of Parliament’s spending watchdog said.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said it was ‘unacceptable’ that accountancy firms and lawyers were making vast sums advising the wealthy on how to ‘rip off’ taxpayers.

‘It is crazy that only those who put their money into tax avoidance schemes are properly punished, and not those who design, promote and sell them,’ said Mrs Hodge, a former Labour minister.

‘Inevitably when we talk about tax avoidance the spotlight falls on the high-profile cases. 

'But tax avoidance is not confined to a small number of wealthy companies and individuals – it is a whole, grubby industry from which shameless tax advisers and promoters are making big bucks.

‘That is simply unacceptable. We cannot have an industry in this country based solely on ripping off the public purse.’ 

The tax gap – the difference between the amount Government considers it is owed and the amount it actually collects – stands at £34billion. 

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to signal a further attempt to crack down on tax dodging in today’s Autumn Statement.

There is speculation that he will make offshore tax evasion a criminal offence and target foreigners who hoard expensive property in London – by forcing them to prove they spend at least 90 days a year in their UK homes if they want to avoid capital gains tax.

Mrs Hodge insisted the Government should go further – punishing those offering advice on tax avoidance with huge fines. 

Currently, those who put their money into tax avoidance schemes have to pay it back if the scheme is deemed unlawful, but there is no meaningful deterrent for those who set them up, she said.

Ms Hodge's comments come after Starbucks said it will not pay 'normal' levels of UK tax for up to three years. Consumers hit out at the firm after it was revealed the company had paid just £8.6million since 1998

‘It is time we cracked down on these individuals – advisers, promoters and lawyers,’ she added. 

‘There needs to be a powerful deterrent that says if you are involved in designing or selling these products you will face criminal prosecution.’

Her comments follow hints from the boss of Starbucks this week that the company will not pay ‘normal’ levels of tax in the UK for up to three years.

The firm faced a consumer backlash after it emerged it had paid just £8.6million in corporation tax since coming to the UK in 1998. 

A Tory MP has apologised after he publicly urged the Government to ignore ‘dog-end’ voters living in ‘outlying regions’.

Mark Garnier said he believed top earners needed certainty from the Chancellor that he was not going to increase tax rates for the rich to appease poorer voters.

The 51-year-old former banker, who is a member of the Commons Treasury committee, said: ‘You’ve got these entrepreneurs who are worried about what is going to happen to their own personal rates of tax. 

'We need to be giving a much clearer message to them that they don’t have to worry about politicians mucking around with tax rates in order to try and attract a few, sort of dog-end voters in sort of the outlying regions of the country.’

Speaking at an event organised by the Economic Affairs think-tank, Mr Garnier immediately added: ‘Not that they’re not important – but what is important is that businesses can feel surety in what is happening within tax rates.’

Mr Garnier last night apologised and said he ‘believed every voter is important everywhere’.

But Labour MP Jon Ashworth said: ‘We are again seeing the true, nasty face of David Cameron’s Conservatives.’
