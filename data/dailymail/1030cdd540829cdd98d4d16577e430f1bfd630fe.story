A small chihuahua was rescued off the California highway.

California Highway Patrol in Contra Costa tweeted a photo on Friday of an officer trying to get the dog off a highway median.

'This little dog needed some help off  I-680 freeway today,' the tweet read. 'We're glad he's safe. #CHP #Safe #Dog #DogTreats.'

Scared: The pooch was reportedly frightened and taken to animal control

Come here! A CHP officer is seen trying to get the dog off of the median divider

A Saturday tweet by the Contra Costa patrol division said that the dog - which is actually a female -  had been taken to Contra Costa County Animal Control in Martinez.

CHP officer Alex Edmond told NBC Bay Area that he and his partner responded after police received two calls about the chihuahua.

'We attempted to coax it, we could tell it was very frightened, it was shaking - we were able to pet it a little bit, but other than that we could tell it was not happy,' Edmon told the station.

Edmon told NBC Bay Area the dog did not respond to his offer of trail mix and was eventually taken by animal control.

According to a CBS San Francisco report, she was eventually lured by a protein bar.

The chihuahua, who has not been named, may already have found a new owner

Meanwhile, the chihuahua may have found a new owner.

On Facebook, Contra Costa Animal Services wrote on Saturday that the dog was 'recovering [...] after her traumatic experience.'

'She may already have a home if her owner doesn't come for her!' the post said.

The chihuahua also seemed to enjoy herself on Mother's Day, according to a Sunday Facebook announcement.

She 'is starting to relax and come out of her shell,' it said. 'Today on Mother's day [sic], two of our wonderful kennel technicians spent their lunch socializing her and helping her overcome her fear.'
