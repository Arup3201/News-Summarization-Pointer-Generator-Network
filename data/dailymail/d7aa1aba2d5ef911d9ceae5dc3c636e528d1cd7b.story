It’s the perfect excuse for men to politely decline requests to lug their other half’s overstuffed suitcase down the stairs.

Women may actually be better at carrying heavy bags than men.

Researchers have found hikers with smaller frames can be better equipped to carry heavy loads than larger people.

The US scientists believe this may be because walkers carrying backpacks also have to haul their own body weight.

Hiking guidelines say that the weight of a backpack should correspond to body size, with smaller individuals bearing lighter burdens.

However, scientists from Kansas State University believe such advice is ‘misleading’.

Professor Michael O’Shea, who led the research, said: ‘Overall strength of an individual does not determine how heavy a backpack a person can comfortably carry.’

He added: ‘As the size of any animal increases, strength increases more slowly than body weight – the reason why tiny ants can carry a disproportionately heavy load compared to their weight.’

He noted that smaller hikers could carry heavier bags than larger students with similar levels of fitness.

Professor O’Shea came up with an equation using pack weight and body proportion data to determine the maximum backpack load for a person of given size.
