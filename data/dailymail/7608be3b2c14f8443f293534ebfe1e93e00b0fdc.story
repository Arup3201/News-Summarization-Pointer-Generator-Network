A mother claims she has been forced to move into a tent because of a row over an unpaid council tax bill which has been going on for seven years.

Marilyn Robinson-White, 64, thought she was exempt from paying because her husband was registered as disabled after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.

She claims she has built up a £50,000 legal bill as she battles to avoid paying the £5,492 council tax.

After a High Court hearing last week, she was evicted from her £200,000 home in Kempston, Bedfordshire, which will now be sold to cover the costs.

Evicted: Marilyn Robinson-White and her daughter Sarah who are living in a tent on an allotment in Kempston, Bedfordshire, after losing a court battle over a £5,500 unpaid council tax bill

As a result, Mrs Robinson-White said she had no choice but to move into a tent on an allotment site close to her home with her daughter Sarah, who is aged in her 30s.

She stopped paying her council tax in 2006 after her husband was diagnosed with a brain tumour.

She was acting as his full-time carer along with her daughter but he later died from his illness two years ago, she said.

Mrs Robinson-White, who owned her property, still insists that she should never have had to pay the bill.

'It was an error by Bedford Borough Council, I was exempt from council tax as it was a disabled household,' said Mrs Robinson-White.

'But after many hearings it has come to this disastrous situation where I’ve had to leave my home.

'We know the neighbours are wondering what on earth is going on, but we don’t have time to be embarrassed.

'All I have ever wanted is an apology from Bedford Borough Council, not huge compensation or anything, just an apology. But I’ve lost my home and I’m going nowhere.'

The council have offered to provide her support, but it is understood that she has rejected all offers of help.

Neighbour Albert Freer said the local residents have been helping Mrs Robinson-White and her daughter by making them breakfast and providing them with hot water.

He said: 'I went into the back garden and saw clothing hanging from the tree and umbrellas and when I asked them what they were doing they said they were camping as they had been evicted.

'It’s freezing outside and they are really vulnerable out there. A few of the neighbours have clubbed together and bought them a tent and a mattress and we provide them with hot water and toast in the mornings.'

A spokesman for Bedford Borough Council said: 'There have been a number of court hearings in relation to this case and the court has overruled Mrs Robinson-White’s objections each time.

'The Magistrates’ Court has confirmed that Mrs Robinson-White was liable to pay £5,492 in Council Tax arrears which dates back to 2006, and is still outstanding.

'Mrs Robinson-White was declared bankrupt by the County Court on 14 October 2010. The costs of the bankruptcy have increased due to the cost of legal proceedings taken by Mrs Robinson-White, and are understood to be a significant amount.

'A Trustee in Bankruptcy has been appointed by the court to manage Mrs Robinson-White’s financial affairs and to raise funds to settle the outstanding debts, and it is the Trustee, not the Council, that has obtained a court order for possession of her property.

'On numerous occasions, the Council has offered advice to Mrs Robinson-White throughout this process, but she had chosen not to accept the advice provided and this has led to the current circumstances. Housing officers are still trying to offer help and provide advice.'
