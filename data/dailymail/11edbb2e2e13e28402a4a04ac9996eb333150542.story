Parking charges and fines reached record levels last year, as councils continued to use motorists as cash cows.

Local authorities collected almost £4million every day in 2013/14, according to responses to Freedom of Information requests.

The amount handed out in penalty notices and parking meter charges added up to £1.38billion in England, compared with £1.32billion the year before.

Cash cow: Parking charges and fines reached record levels last year with local authorities making almost £4million every day

Westminster Council – which is run by the Conservatives and covers Central London – made the most, at £81million.

In 2012, Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, vowed to expose the ‘great council cash cow cover-up’ over parking. He described the charges as a ‘shopping tax’ and accused councils of waging a ‘local war against motorists’.

Mr Pickles has imposed a series of freezes on council tax, and has called on councils to cut waste and reduce the salaries of highly paid staff.

The latest figures suggest that, rather than making cuts, local authorities may be using motorists to raise revenue.

Shopkeepers say heavy parking charges harm town centres, encouraging people to drive to out-of-town shopping malls or to use the internet.

Labour, which collated the figures, says they show that people in Conservative council areas in the south of England fare the worst. Tory authorities took in £31.69 per resident in charges and fines, 41 per cent more than the £22.50 per resident for Labour councils.

A representative sample of 214 of the 326 councils in England responded to Labour’s survey, which found that in 2013/14, the total amount of charges and fines across those 214 councils was £891million.

This suggests that the total across England was £1.38billion, or £3.78million every day.

In London, the revenue was £65.01 per resident – more than five times the £12.06 in the West Midlands and the North West. Councils in the South West raised £27.32 per resident, compared with the South East (£24.69), East of England (£18.71) and Yorkshire and Humber (£12.95).

Conservative authorities raised an average of £31.69 per resident, compared with £22.50 for Labour.

Hilary Benn, Labour’s local government spokesman, said: ‘David Cameron and Eric Pickles claimed they would bring parking charges and fines down but they have completely failed. Tory councils are making most money from charges and fines.’

Last year Mr Pickles told town halls to reduce parking charges that ‘undermine the vitality of town centres’.

He issued guidance urging councils to make high streets more car-friendly, saying ‘anti-car policies’ were ‘driving motorists into the arms of internet retailers and out-of-town superstores’.

Last night, Mr Pickles said: ‘These figures show how town halls are committing daylight robbery by ripping off drivers.’
