Mo Martin won the Ricoh Women’s British Open after firing an eagle on the final hole to finish a shot ahead of Suzann Pettersen and Shanshan Feng.

The American’s approach to the 18th ran into the flag and finished six feet away to set up a closing round of 72 in windy conditions at Royal Birkdale.

Martin, who had just one top-10 finish in 63 LPGA starts, said: ‘The second shot is one I’m going to remember. I actually heard it hit the flag and said, ‘‘Oh my God!”

‘This was a full three wood. I was off a little bit of a left-to-right lie which let it feed [to the hole]. At this point, I’m saying, ‘‘Sit!’’, then I said, “Go!’’ and then I said, ‘‘I don’t know what else to say!”’

Martin had to wait for an hour to see if any of the later starters could match her total of one under par, but Pettersen and China’s Feng both shot 75, although the Norwegian did finish her round with two birdies.

‘Is this real life?’ Martin added when told she had won. ‘It was a tough day of golf. It was very windy and this course is very challenging. From the first time I saw Royal Birkdale, I fell in love with it. I think the layout is absolutely phenomenal.’

England’s Charley Hull, 18, was joint 12th after a disappointing 78 and a 73 meant Dame Laura Davies, 50, was the  best-placed British player in joint ninth.
