After 90 tons of manure and two years of round-the-clock care, Britain's most expensive pineapple is almost ready to eat.

Ripening in the greenhouse at the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall, the record-breaking fruit was grown using Victorian cultivation methods and is worth an estimated £10,000.

But if the Heligan pineapple sounds pricey, then spare a thought for the Japanese buyer who splashed out 1.6 million yen (£10,300) for just two melons.

Expensive: Canteloupe, or Yubari, melons like the ones sold last week are a status symbol in Japan

The record-breaking Yubari, or canteloupe, melons were sold during an auction at Sapporo Central Wholesale Market in northern Hokkaido last Friday.

The eye-watering price is the third highest ever paid for the fruit, with the most expensive pair selling for 2.5 million yen (£16,300) in 2008.

Although few command the price of a Yubari melon, Japan is one of the most expensive places in the world for fruit and vegetables.

A single apple typically retails for around £3.30 while the average price of a presentation pack of 20 cherries is a whopping £65.50.

Three: The number of trips to Falmouth needed to collect 90 tonnes of manure

Four: Number of people required to tend the pineapples and replace the old manure

One: The number of painters needed to keep the glasshouse in pineapple-worthy condition

But despite the high prices commanded by canteloupe melons, a status symbol in the Far East, there are some fruit and vegetables that cost even more.

Truffles regularly fetch more than £196,000 per pound at auction, while saffron sells for an average of £3,200.

A single pound of saffron contains more than 225,000 stigmas from 75,000 crocus plants, while truffles are both rare and difficult to dig up.

Other painfully expensive varieties of fruit and vegetable include Ruby Roman grapes, which can sell for as much as £4,100 per pound at auction, which works out as roughly £170 per grape.

Similarly expensive are La Bonnotte potatoes, which are grown exclusively on the island of Noirmoutier, just off the French Atlantic coast.

Only 100 tonnes of La Bonnotte potatoes are grown each year, and they sell for a wallet-busting £210 for a single pound.
