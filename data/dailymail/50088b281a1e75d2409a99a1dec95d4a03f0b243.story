An album of messages kept by a nurse during the First World War and written in by the soldiers she saved, is to be sold at auction.

The book, once belonging to Red Cross nurse Hilda Stephen Thomas, also contains photographs and drawings and has been unearthed in Derbyshire.

The earliest entry dates back to 1907 and tells the story of Hilda, from Glamorgan, South Wales, who cared for soldiers at a hospital in the Mumbles area of Swansea.

The book is full of messages from soldiers Hilda treated during the war

Private Parry's message: 'Flowers may wither, leaves may die, friends may forget you, but never will I'

The album also contains sketches and paintings, presumably also done by wounded soldiers

The album contains touching messages, such as one from Private J. Parry 2555, of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who wrote in 1916: 'To my sisters at the Red Cross Hospital Mumbles... Flowers may wither, leaves may die, friends may forget you, but never will I.'

Another
 entry, dated June 24, 1915, was 
written by Bandsman S Farrell of the 2nd Leinster Regiment. It reads: 'When the war is all over and peace is proclaimed, the cannons have long
 ceased their grumbles, we will shout hip aray and long for the day to 
return once again to old Mumbles.

'So
 now boys, I ask you to join in  with me in praise of the sisters we 
mention. May god from above protect them with love for we may want again
 there attention.'

Photographs of wounded soldiers and of a funeral, included in the album

A third, from 1915, reads: 'Come all my brave old Comrades, 
attention pay to me, if by chance you do get wounded and sent across the
 sea, come straight away to mumbles and there you'll have some gaff. 
Your wounds will soon be mended by the good old Red Cross Staff'

The album 
also contains a pen and ink drawings and photographs, showing two 
recovering soldiers playing chess, with a nurse- who may be Hilda- 
watching on.

The book was found by Charles Hanson, manager of Hansons Auctioneers in Etwall, Derbyshire.

He said: 'The album is a remarkable archive of content.

'I
 hope the album, for its poignancy of content, will appeal to an 
institution where it can be placed on permanent display. It may even 
appeal to a medic.'

Hilda's
album will be entered in to Hansons military auction titled 'A 
Century On' which will take place on Monday April 28 and is expected to fetch up to £200.

The flute will be played by Andrew Fairley, who bought it in a junk shop in 1963

A flute thought to have been carved during the Great War is to be played for the first time in more than 50 years tomorrow.

Andrew Fairley bought the instrument, which is made from a cardboard tube, printed Wills tobacco paper and bullet casings, at a junk shop in 1963 in Brentford, Middlesex, paying he thinks five shillings.

Retired professional flautist Mr Fairley, 74, is playing polka and waltz pieces on it as a solo at a charity concert in Woodbridge, Suffolk.

He said: ‘It is amazing that it has survived this long and I thought the time was right to play it to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the war.

‘It is fairly basic and quirky, but I have learned to temper it and use some odd fingering to get round some suspect notes.’

The divorced father-of-two recently the sent 11in-long flute, which he keeps in a drawer at his home in Felixstowe, Suffolk, to be examined by officials at the Imperial War Museum who wrote back to say it was highly likely to have been made in the trenches.

Mr Fairley added: ‘They said it was totally unique and they had never seen anything like it before - but all the materials it was built from came from the war period.

‘The tone hole, or embouchure hole, is a bullet casing cut down and the blow hole is also made from brass bullet casing.

‘Holding that part together is rifle pull through cord. They had to make do with simple stuff, anything that was available in the trenches.

Mr Fairley said the flute had been waxed, possibly with boot polish, to hold it together and make it waterproof.

He added: ‘I have got no idea who made it. I guess it landed up in the junk shop after a house clearance. I just bought it as a curiosity.’

The instrument is to be played at a concert given by the 30-piece Community String Orchestra which Mr Fairley conducts.
