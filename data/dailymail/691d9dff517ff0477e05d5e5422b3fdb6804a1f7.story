Women are now joining the ranks of the Ukrainian army’s National guard, as it is claimed that dozens of children have been killed

Female recruits could be seen taking the military oath at a National Guard ceremony outside Kiev as some 600 new volunteers joined the ranks.

This comes as an MP from the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine claimed that more than 40 children have been killed in battles in the area - a figure ten times higher than the official toll.

Tatyana Bahteyeva, a doctor and chairman of Kiev's parliamentary committee on health, warned: ‘More than 40 children have died from shrapnel wounds.

‘That is from shrapnel after explosions in windows next to which children were located. Innocent children have been hit with bullets to their hearts, which brings immediate death.’

An MP from Donetsk region, in the forefront of recent battles, she claimed her shocking figure - disputed by the authorities and not possible to immediately verify - came from her own analysis of local morgue records and information from doctors and hospitals over a ten week period, her office stated.

‘This situation is known by everyone in Donetsk, this is why people are so scared,’ she said, alleging that official figures, which say four children were killed, have masked the true horror of the death toll since Kiev launched its ‘anti terrorist campaign’ against separatists in mid-April.

Officially, at least 375 people on both sides have perished in the conflict.

The pro-Kiev regional administration in Donetsk yesterday denied her claims, but her spokeswoman countered: ‘This information is derived from her own sources, primarily from the morgues and from the doctors.’

A former supporter of ex-president Viktor Yanukovyuch, who currently runs the parliamentary health committee, Bahteyeva alleged the authorities had failed to collate ‘centralised information about the number of deaths’.

Russia says tens of thousands of Ukrainians, including 5,300 children, have fled eastern regions into and flooded into its border regions as refugees.

UNICEF reported in early June that seven children had been injured in the fighting in the east of Ukraine since May 9. UNICEF noted the crisis is having an increasing impact on children and urged all the parties to stop the violence.

On Monday, insurgents in eastern Ukraine say they will honour a ceasefire declared by the Ukrainian president and engage in more talks to help resolve the conflict.

Alexander Borodai, one of the rebel leaders who took part in today's talks in Donetsk, said they would respect the ceasefire declared on Friday by Petro Poroshenko.

Mr Borodai also promised that the insurgents would release observers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe whom they have held.

Meanwhile,
 a Moscow MP who is wanted in Britain over the death of dissident secret
 serviceman Alexander Litvinenko, has called for Russia to bring back 
the KGB.

Andrey Lugovoy,  has said he wanted the Russian national security service to be renamed KGB once more.

KGB, an acronym for Committee for State Security, was abolished after the USSR collapsed in 1991.

‘I am in support of renaming the Federal Security Service (FSB) into the Committee for State Security,’ said Lugovoy, signalling he would formally propose the move.

‘The KGB was portrayed as a monster that only supported dictatorship in the USSR.’

But, he claimed, it had been necessary to ‘fight’ against dissidents in Soviet times.

‘All the other actions of the organisation focused on state security.

‘Personally, I support the idea of a renaming. We need to think about it.’

The proposal comes amid claims that Vladimir Putin is seeking a return to Soviet-style rule after his land grab for Crimea, restoring it to Kremlin control in the teeth of Western opposition.

Lugovoy, 47, an ex-KGB staffer, is wanted by Scotland Yard over the death of Putin enemy Litvinenko in 2006 from radioactive polonium-210 poisoning amid suspicions he had continued links to the FSB, the modern KGB.

An MP for the pro-Kremlin Liberal Democrat ultra-nationalist party, he denies the accusation.

The Kremlin refuses to extradite him to Britain to face trial for murder.

Foreign Secretary William Hague 
yesterday warned Putin of new hard-hitting sanctions if he fails to 
openly and actively support the Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko's 
plan for peace.

‘By Friday, we will be able to see how Russia is responding,’ he said, stressing time is running out.
