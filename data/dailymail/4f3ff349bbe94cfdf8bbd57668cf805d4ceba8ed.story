Coleen Rooney, Sam Faiers and Ferne McCann all share a love of fake tan, glamorous clothes and serious bling but the famous trio have stripped off the make-up and hung up their designer dresses for a new charity campaign.

The WAG and the TOWIE stars have joined forces with actress Kym Marsh for the new Jeans for Genes campaign - a charity that supports children with genetic conditions and their families. 

Wearing natural make-up and a casual outfit, the celebrities are encouraging women across the UK to buy this specially 
designed T-shirt and show their support for Jeans for Genes day this 
September.

The day is held on September 19 and the charity has teamed up with Edinburgh College of Art for the design of their official charity T-shirt, as modelled by the ladies.

The T-shirt, which will be available to buy online, features a one-off design by young designer Rachel Hill.

It was one of hundreds submitted via a competition open to Edinburgh College of Art students, features a double helix, which depicts the structure of a DNA molecule, combined with pastel colours.

Rachel’s creation was selected as the winning design by an expert panel comprising of fashion experts and popular style icons including Coleen Rooney, Jaime Winstone, Stylist Magazine Fashion Director, Alexandra Fullerton, and founder of the Scottish Fashion Awards, Tessa Hartmann.

The judging panel said that when choosing the £20 winning T-shirt design, they were looking for something that was ‘stylish and appealing, and a must-have item for the wardrobe.’
