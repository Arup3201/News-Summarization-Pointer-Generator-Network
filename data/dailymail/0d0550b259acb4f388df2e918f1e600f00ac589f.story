A giant robotic hand arches down and locks its metallic fingers around a car like a scene from a futuristic film.

With frightening power it clamps the roof of the green Panda and uses its superhuman robot strength to hold it aloft.

With frightening power it squeezes the vehicle's frame as if it were no stronger than paper, smashing through the windows and crumpling the body work.

RoboHand, a giant robotic hand with hydraulically-powered fingers, crushes a green Panda at Life Science Centre in Newcastle

RoboHand is the attraction that has been dazzling audiences at the Maker Faire UK, a science technology and arts and craft extravaganza at Newcastle's Life Science Centre.

The vast contraption is 30 times larger than an average human hand, with an arm measuring eight meters and weighing in at six tons.

Hydraulically powered fingers give the hand enough strength to crush almost anything put before it.

The fearsome RoboHand makes light work of a Panda car, as it hoists it aloft in front of the crowds at Newcastle's Maker Faire UK

Originally commissioned for the 2007 Robodock Festival in the Netherlands, Robohand is the brain-child of American artist Christian Ristow.

It was built from recycled scrap-metal and due to its huge size, was destined for a return to the junk yard following its festival appearance.

But after its owners made modifications, Robohand is now a sustainable and transportable art object which tours internationally.

The big squeeze: After hoisting the four-door car in to the air, Robohand's hydraulically-powered fingers easily crush its roof and boot, having already made light work of the windows

With its boot and roof now crumpled, the car hangs precariously from RoboHand's thumb. the giant mechanical crusher's fingers are released as the vehicle's fate is sealed

The RoboHand is the headline act at the Maker Faire UK in Newcastle, which is expected to draw in 10,000 visitors

As well as cars, objects set to face its mangling power during the festival include washing machines, oil drums, wardrobes and pianos.

The two day festival is expected to draw in around 10,000 visitors.

Design, engineering and science fans can expect a range of other attractions including an eco-friendly pink wheelie bin giant, 3D printers and a fire breathing dragon.
