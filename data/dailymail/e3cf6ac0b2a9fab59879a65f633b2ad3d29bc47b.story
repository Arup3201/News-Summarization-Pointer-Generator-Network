Sergio Aguero will make his 100th Premier League appearance for Manchester City at Southampton on Sunday with manager Manuel Pellegrini predicting that he can join Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in a three-way claim to be the world's best player.

The football world is still buzzing after the Argentinian's midweek performance against Bayern Munich in which his hat-trick earned an unexpected 3-2 victory.

Many pundits believe that the debate over who is the world's best player - for so long considered a two-horse race between the two Spanish-based global icons - now needs to include City's 26-year-old striker.

And while Pellegrini is not ready to declare his man number one in the world just yet, the City manager firmly believes he has the potential to be precisely that.

Pellegrini said: 'I said three or four weeks ago that we are always trying to demand that Sergio be a top player and be the best player in the world because he can do it.

'I hope he will continue in the same way and I am sure he is one of the top five players in the world at this moment.

'I don't want to say he is better than Messi or Cristiano but he must be very near.'

Aguero has scored an astonishing 64 goals in his 99 City outings to date, a mark only bettered in Premier League history by Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy over their opening century of matches.

Pellegrini added: 'It is difficult to compare the careers of very important players; Ruud van Nistelrooy has already finished his career.

'Sergio is not starting his career but he is only 26 and has a lot more years to play here.

'I always say, I am always demanding that he try to be the best player because he has all the conditions to do it. I am very glad for him that he improves every day.'

It all points to a growing feeling that City are too dependent on Aguero and running the risk of losing ground should he come down with injury.

Pellegrini insists that City are more than a one-man team but does concede that on current form, Aguero is irreplaceable.

He said: 'Of course. I don't think anybody can replace Messi at Barcelona or Cristiano at Real Madrid or Sergio here. They are very important players.

'It is not the same playing without Aguero as it is playing with Aguero.

'But I always say we have a squad and if, for some reason, Sergio cannot play, we must have another one who can do it.

Pellegrini insists his side are not a one-man team, but admits it would be more difficult without Aguero

'We won the title last year without Sergio for a lot of games but of course when he plays, he makes a difference.'

David Silva, Aleksandar Kolarov and Edin Dzeko all remain injured and unavailable for the visit to Southampton.
