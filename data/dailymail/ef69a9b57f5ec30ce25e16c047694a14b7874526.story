Two U.S. troops have been shot dead by an Afghan soldier as violence rages across the country in response to Korans being burned.

The gunmen opened fire after calls from Taliban insurgents to attack U.S. military bases in revenge attacks for U.S. troops setting fire to the Muslim holy books.

The attack took place during a protest outside a U.S. military base in the Khogyani district of Nangarhar Province.

It is the worst case of violence in three days of unrest that began when Korans – used by former Afghan 
detainees at Nato’s Bagram air base – were among rubbish taken to a 
‘burn pit’ and recovered by Afghans working there.

The protests drew thousands of angry Afghans to the streets, chanting 'Death to America!' for the third consecutive day in violence that has killed 11 people and wounded many more. The violence could intensify during tomorrow after Friday prayers.

The Taliban urged Afghans to target foreign military bases and kill Westerners in retaliation for the Koran burning at Bagram airfield on Tuesday, later directing its plea to the security forces, calling on them to 'turn their guns on the foreign infidel invaders,' it said on its site shahamat-english.com.   

In the letter  to the Afghan president  Hamid Karzai, Obama expresses his 'deep regret for the reported incident' and offers his 'sincere apologies.'

The letter continues: 'I convey my deep sympathies and ask you and the people to accept my deep apologies.

'The error was inadvertent; I assure you that we will take the appropriate steps to avoid any recurrence, to include holding accountable those responsible.'

White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said: 'In the letter, delivered by Ambassador (Ryan) Crocker this afternoon in Kabul, the president also expressed our regret and apologies over the incident in which religious materials were unintentionally mishandled at Bagram Airbase.'

While Afghan President Hamid Karzai today blamed a U.S. soldier for 'ignorantly' burning copies of the Koran at a NATO base, an accusation that could trigger more protests across Afghanistan.   

The incendiary calls came as NATO confirmed a man in Afghan army uniform killed two of its troops in the east, but declined to say if the shooting was connected to the protests.     

The deaths of the troops came as a 
racist effigy of the U.S. President daubed with the graffiti 'black dog 
Obama' was set alight in a furious response to troops burning copies of 
the Koran.

The furious 
Afghan protesters lifted aloft the model while yelling anti-U.S. chants 
in the second day of demonstrations across Afghanistan.

Seven people have so far been killed in clashes between Afghan security forces and protesters.  A military official 
said they contained extremist messages. The U.S. has apologised.

The effigy of Barack Obama was 
paraded through the streets in front of raucous mobs before being burned
 in the street. The burning of the Obama effigy came in one of the most 
violent outbursts of anger against the U.S. that has been in the 
country.  

A number of the deaths were at Camp Phoenix, a U.S. base outside the capital 
Kabul, where security guards killed one person, and in Jalalabad and 
Logar province.

The 
American Embassy in Afghanistan said its staff were in 'lockdown' and 
travel had been suspended as thousands of people expressed fury over the
 burning of Islam's holy book.

U.S.
 commander of Nato troops in 
Afghanistan, General John Allen, was forced to apologise over the claims
 foreign troops had ‘improperly disposed’ of copies of the Koran in what
 has been a public relations nightmare.

The apology from the military leader was followed up by one from Obama.

The statement from President Hamid Karzai's office says the U.S. ambassador delivered the letter on Thursday.

In the letter, which is quoted in the statement, Obama expresses his 'deep regret for the reported incident' and offers his 'sincere apologies.'

According to the statement, Obama wrote: 'The error was inadvertent; I assure you that we will take the appropriate steps to avoid any recurrence, to include holding accountable those responsible.'

Protests started when Afghan laborers found charred copies at the Bagram Airbase, about an hour's drive north of Kabul, and the uproar continued today as forces failed to contain the fury of thousands of Afghans chanting anti-American slogans.

In Parwan province, home to the sprawling Bagram airbase where the Koran burning incident occurred, two people were shot dead by Afghan police and 13 wounded while attacking offices, provincial spokesman Roshan Khalid said.

Another protester was shot dead by police in Logar province, east of the capital, the governor's spokesman, Deen Mohammad Darwish, added.

Afghan health ministry spokesman Ghulam 
Sakhi Kargar said a fourth person also died in hospital in Kabul from 
gunshot wounds received during one of two shooting incidents at protests
 in at least four areas of the capital.

Later, wounded protesters along the busy Jalalabad road on the fringe of Kabul said Afghan police had fired on them.

Twenty-one people, including 11 
policemen, were wounded in the capital, said Mohammad Zahir, head of 
Kabul police's crimes unit, which included the city police chief, Ayoub 
Salangi, who was hit in the ankle by a stone.

Police said most injuries were caused by
 flying stones and sticks hurled by protesters who shouted 'Death to America!' 
and 'Death to (President Hamid) Karzai' in a large demonstration on the 
outskirts of the Afghan capital.

Demonstrators had 
charged police lines and nearby military bases at a protest on the edge 
of Kabul, burning tires, smashing vehicles and building windows and even parading an effigy of U.S. president Barack Obama.

Outcry: Afghan men shout anti-U.S slogans in response to the burning of copies of the Koran

Winning the hearts and minds of Afghans 
is critical to efforts to defeat the Taliban but similar incidents in 
the past have caused deep divisions and resentment among Afghans.

Critics say Western troops often fail to
 grasp the country's religious and cultural sensitivities and demonstrations by as many as 2,000 people broke out as word of the Koran find 
spread.

It is not the first time they have found themselves at the heart of controversy and comes after seven foreign UN workers were killed 
during protests that raged across Afghanistan for three days in April 
2011 after a U.S. pastor burned a Koran in Florida.

Wounded: At least 26 people were wounded by gunfire alone, while others were hit by stones and debris during protests in Afghanistan
