An Italian Trade union has been slammed by Jewish groups for offering a spoof 'Hitler Prize' to people who work with animals, who have been targeted by extremists.

Feder Fauna, a union for people working commercially with animals such as breeders and farmers, named the prize because the Nazi leader created a law to protect animals while ordering human experiments.

The union has called on its members to nominate those they considered 'most worthy' of receiving the award such as those who have suffered violence from animal rights activists.

Crass: A poster for the Italian trade union's 'Hitler Prize', which has enraged Jewish groups

Massimiliano Filippi, general secretary of Feder Fauna, said: 'The Hitler Prize represents a condemnation of those who trample on human rights in the name of the ideology of "animal rights"!

'I find that asking to stop experiments on rats and proposing instead experiments be done on prisoners has a close affinity to Nazism.'A poster for the prize features a 
picture of Hitler feeding two deer at the entrance to the Auschwitz 
concentration camp in occupied Poland where 1.3 million people were killed.

After coming into power in 1933, the Nazis brought in a raft of laws to protects Animals.

The first was a law banning vivisection which was enacted in August 1933, by Hermann Göring as the prime minister of Prussia.

In November 1933, the Reichstierschutzgesetz (Reich Animal Protection Act) was brought in banning, among other things, the force-feeding of birds, commercial animal trapping and the docking the ears and tails off dogs without anesthesia, was also banned.

Regulations were placed on the boiling of
 lobsters and crabs in restaurants and in one case, Goering even sent a 
fisherman to a concentration camp for cutting up a frog to use as bait.

Severe restrictions were placed on hunting, and the shoeing of horses became regulated.

The Nazis also established nature preserves, and introduced a 
school curriculum for the humane treatment of animals.

It features the slogan Animal Rights' with the word ‘rights’ replaced with ‘Reich’.

However despite having an anti-Nazi message, the prize has been condemned for diminishing the suffering of those who died in the holocaust and because it could be seen to show Hitler in a positive light.

Italy's only female Rabbi Barbara Aeillo told the Local that the prize 'exemplifies a disturbing trend of intolerance and hate that is on the rise not only in Italy but throughout Europe.

'Creeping Nazism is a slow but steady trend that minimizes the Holocaust, demeans the memory of those murdered and diminishes the suffering of the survivors.

'The fact that a competition like the Hitler Award is even conceivable, let alone celebrated, is more than troubling and indicates a significant change in the Italian public’s general tolerance for anti-semitic remarks and activity.'

Angelo Bonelli, leader of Italy's Green party, described the prize as a 'sordid provocation'.

Last week former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi provoked outrage when he said his children are persecuted 'like Jews under Hitler'.

Asked about whether his five children had asked him to sell his media empire and leave Italy to escape his legal troubles, Berlusconi said: 'My children say that they feel like Jewish families in Germany under Hitler's regime. Truly, everyone is against us.'

Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler murdered an estimated six million Jews during World War Two.
