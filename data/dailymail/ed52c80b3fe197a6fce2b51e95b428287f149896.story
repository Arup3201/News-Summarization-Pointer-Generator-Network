Ronaldinho seems to have been given the perfect gift by NBA star LeBron James, a dazzling watch thought to be worth around £40,000.

The Brazilian footballer, now plying his trade with Queretaro in Mexico after stints with Barcelona and AC Milan, said thanks to the Cleveland Cavaliers small forward on Instagram while posing with the Audemars Piguet watch.

It is part of a limited edition of 600 designed by James, and is said to popular model with Premier League footballers.

The 18-carat watch also features a scratch-resistant sapphire glass, while the LBJ signature is printed in blue.

It is described by Audemars Piguet as 'an iconic watch for a legendary athlete'. They add: It is in the constant striving for perfection personified in his life both on and off the court that LeBron James sees the deepest connection between himself and Audemars Piguet. 

'This model is a celebration of James' outstanding achievements to date.'

It was released in November 2013 but Ronaldinho still appeared to be delighted, posting on social media site Instagram: 'I loved this gift! Limited series watch from my bro LeBron James. Thanks, my friend!'

The present from LeBron wasn't the only thing to put a smile on the World Cup winner's face recently, as he was pictured partying in Cancun last week.

His side Queretaro, whom he signed a two-year deal with last year, are currently languishing in the relegation zone but Ronaldinho hit  the clubbing hotspot, with women flocking around him.

He is approaching his 35th birthday, and made the trip after his side's 5-0 win against Santos Laguna in the cup. Ronaldinho played 71 minutes before being taken off.

The playmaker was back in action at the weekend, and was again substituted during a 4-1 defeat by Puebla.

His evening wasn't finished there though, as a young fan entered the dugout to give his hero a hug.

Ronaldinho is a former Ballon d'Or winner, and collected two La Liga winners' medals and one Champions League trophy during an successful spell with Barcelona between 2003 and 2008.
