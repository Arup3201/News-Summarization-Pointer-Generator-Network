If you have ever wondered how famous people through the ages might be connected to one another, a new interactive map could cure your curiosity.

Kindred Britain, a network of nearly 30,000 individuals mostly made up of Britons, explains how Charles Dickens is connected to Napoleon Bonaparte and how Isaac Newton is linked with Jane Austen, as well as a countless other connections.

It looks at relationships of blood and marriage in a bid to highlight Britain’s history as a giant family affair.

By dragging two nodes, representing two 
British luminaries, on top of one another, people can immediately see how
 the two individuals differ in terms of historical time and lifespans.

Any professional similarities are also shown.

When the node’s outer circle turns 
green, users can create a familial path between the two people, 
which shows marriages and family lines.

This
 information can be viewed as a type of family tree, to highlight 
different generations.

A ‘plot’ view additionally shows the nodes by year of 
birth and year of death to show how the individuals compare on a 
chronological scale.

Researchers at Stanford University, California, created the interactive database to show the ‘profoundly and unusually familial nature of British society and culture.'

It also demonstrates how famous Britons are also connected to international historical figures, including George Washington and Napoleon Bonaparte.

The scientists said that if it were a book, Kindred Britain would measure at least a foot in width.

The content of the online project’ is made up of three key parts that show an individual’s network, timeline and geography.

Users can drag and drop ‘nodes’ representing famous people onto one another to explore how they are connected to each other.

Historical luminaries include prime ministers, novelists and poets, actors, explorers, musicians, scientists, painters and naval officers.

The four most viewed people are William Shakespeare, George Washington, Virginia Woolf and Charles Darwin.

By clicking on a node, users can call up biographical detail about an individual, such as Isaac Newton (pictured) as well as connections

It is possible to explore curated connections and stories and follow some of the 870million different paths connecting the 30,000 people that make up the Kindred Britain network.

‘Find out more about figures or families you already know something about.

'Or, through connecting someone familiar to a disparate sphere or world, reframe and re-imagine an individual whom you think you already understand. The possibilities are virtually endless,’ the creators of the project wrote on their website.

Another view shows individuals' professions to give approximations of social connections.

The ‘force’ view then arranges the nodes according to those that are attracted and repelled by one another, based on these connections.

It is possible to use the site to look at
 famous rivals, such as Thomas More (played by actor Paul Scofield who is pictured left)  and Oliver Cromwell (right in a portrait); and judge and the
 accused, such as Valentine Dale and Mary Queen of Scots

The information can be viewed as a type of family tree, (a tree connecting Oliver Cromwell and Virginia Woolf is pictured) to highlight different generations, while a 'plot' view shows the nodes by year of birth and year of death to show how the individuals compare on a chronological scale

Users of the vast site can also look up information about the lives of the Britons, including major historical events designed to give context to an individual’s life.

It is possible to use the site to look at famous rivals, such as Thomas More and Oliver Cromwell, judges and the accused, such as Valentine Dale and Mary Queen of Scots, and authors and subjects, such as William Shakespeare and John of Gaunt.

It is possible to use the site to look at authors and subjects, such as William Shakespeare and John of Gaunt, which is pictured as a 'Force layout' showing professions in common. The force layout arranges the nodes so they are attracted to the other nodes that they are connected to, and pushed away from nodes they are not
