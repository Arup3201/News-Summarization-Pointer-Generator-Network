The early years of a child's life are often most precious to their parents. But one mother lost all her recollections of her young sons - after she suffered brain damage in a car crash.

Jenny Crow, 37, had just picked up her sons from primary school when she was involved in car accident in September 2009.

It left her unable to remember most events from the last seven years of her life, including giving birth to her sons Harrison, 6, and Jackson, 5.

Today: Jenny Crow, pictured with Harrison and Jackson, is rebuilding her life with her family following her devastating car accident

But she is now recovering from her injuries and is keen to build a a new life with her two sons.

Her father Ron Spencer, 63, a painter and decorator, said: ‘Jenny is doing wonderfully well after everything that has happened.

‘She can’t remember giving birth to the boys as seven years of her memory have been totally wiped out. But she loves them dearly and is now carrying on with her life with them.

‘We are just grateful that she is still with us. We don’t know if her memory will ever fully return, but she is just taking each day as it comes.’

The smash happened as a pregnant Mrs Crow picked up her two young sons from school. They were strapped into their car seats in the back of her car when she collided head-on with a bus coming in the opposite direction.

The boys were unhurt, but Mrs Crow was rushed to Peterborough District Hospital with two smashed thigh bones and a broken hip. She had an operation to repair her broken legs, but she remained in a coma for nearly three weeks. Sadly she lost her baby.

Mr Spencer, who lives with wife Lynette, 53, said: ‘She took the full impact of the crash. She was put on a ventilator and the doctors were really worried when she didn’t come out of the coma after four days, as they expected her to.

‘We kept talking to her, begging her to wake up. Eventually after nearly three weeks she opened her eyes and it was the most amazing moment. Her first words to me were ‘I love you’.

Mrs Crow, who lives in Great Casterton in Rutland, spent the next 18 months at a rehabilitation centre in Cambridge where she learnt to walk and talk again. She also had daily physiotherapy treatment to help her walk.

But even though she is slowly recovering movement she still can’t remember the previous seven years of her life.

In hospital: Jenny lost her unborn child following the car accident

She had been six months pregnant with her third child at the time of the crash, and can’t remember being pregnant at all.

She also can’t remember the birth of her two sons, her brother’s wedding and her son’s first day at school.

Mr Spencer added: ‘Her long term memory is still good. She can remember things she did as a child. But she can’t remember the last few years before the crash.

‘We have had to tell her what happened in those seven years to fill in the gaps for her. She didn’t remember giving birth to the boys, but she knew who they were when she came out of her coma.

‘Its been a big incentive for her, to get better to come home for them. Now that she is back home she is really thrilled. She loves going swimming with the boys.'

Jenny separated from her husband this summer and moved in with her father and stepmother at their home in Great Casterton. She hopes to be able to complete a degree in early years education.

Mr Spencer said: ‘The crash has definitely changed Jenny’s life. Before it happened she ran three children’s nurseries and always had a project on the go. She was so busy and lived life to the full.

‘Now she has to take things more slowly, but she is just thankful to be alive and back with her sons.’
