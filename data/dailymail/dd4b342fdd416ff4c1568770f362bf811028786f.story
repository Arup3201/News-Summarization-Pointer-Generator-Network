Sam Allardyce was told in no uncertain terms in the summer there needed to be a change to his style of play. After West Ham beat Manchester City 2-1 on Saturday, Sportsmail asked Hammers blogger Rugrid if Allardyce is getting the credit he deserves for turning things around.

Sam Allardyce has made a bright start to the season at West Ham and has bedded in his summer signings

We are known famously as a very hard bunch to impress, us West Ham fans. Just ask Alan Pardew, or Harry Redknapp. They both helped lift the club to the promised land of Premier League football, yet they both will tell you that if the team starts underperforming, the fans will be straight on your back.

Another man who will no doubt echo this view is Sam Allardyce. Big Sam has endured a turbulent relationship with the clubs fans since taking over as boss in 2011, and it wasn’t so long ago that the vast majority of supporters, including myself, were calling for the clubs owners to dispense with Allardyce.

We had just witnessed a season in which, yes survival was reached, but achieved in a manner that simply wasn’t deemed acceptable in east London. The negative, fingers-crossed style football which we had come accustomed to under Allardyce had simply run its course – and it had to stop.

Sir Alex Ferguson said the West Ham way was a myth but Allardyce is proving that it is very real

Sir Alex Ferguson is wrong, the West Ham way is not a ‘myth’ - It is very real, and we are witnessing first hand this season just how important it is to play the right way, the West Ham way.

It is not based on results. Yes, of course we want to see our team win; it’s what they’re on that pitch to do. But it’s how the team go about their business that we West Ham fans are particularly fussy about. It’s about going onto that pitch and putting your body on the line, giving everything for the team, and most importantly attacking the opposition with desire and imagination.

Allardyce was told in no uncertain terms over the summer that he had to deliver the West Ham way brand style of football this season – especially when playing at home. Many, like myself, did not believe Big Sam could deliver on this, but I am willing to accept that our manager, so far this season, has proved me wrong.

Diafra Sakho is just one of a whole host of signings that has given the supporters plenty to smile about

The signings made by the club this summer have simply transformed the team into one that looks more than capable of holding their own in the Premier League. Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho, Cheikhou Kouyate, Diego Poyet, Aaron Cresswell, Mauro Zarate and Morgan Amalfitano all signed permanent contracts with the club, while Alex Song and Carl Jenkinson arrived on season-long loan deals. Then behind the scenes, Teddy Sheringham joined Allardyces backroom team as the new attacking coach.

These are changes that were made by the owners, and our manager, to make sure that they delivered on what the fans demanded – and I believe now Allardyce deserves credit where it’s due.

Enner Valencia scored a fine goal against Hull in the Premier League and has been in impressive form

To be fair to Big Sam he always delivers on what is asked of him – promotion at the first attempt, retaining our Premier League status – and so far is delivering on playing the brand of football that has been asked.

The time has come for us fans gave Allardyce our full support – as rare as that is in football these days. There is a real buzz around Upton Park at present, and the last thing we need is our manager turned on by the supporters the moment a match is lost.

If Big Sam continues to deliver the way he has so far this season, then who’s to say where it will end?
