A judge who allowed a paedophile to walk free in a case where the 13-year-old victim was described as a 'predator' was forced to alter his sentence today, but still failed to jail him or apologise.

Neil Wilson, 41, was given a suspended sentence last week after Judge Nigel Peters QC said the child may have looked and acted older than her years.

The judge today called back Wilson because his sentence contained an error and added four months to his initial eight months in jail, still suspended for two years.

But separate to this the Attorney General's office has confirmed it is still investigating if this is too lenient, and will come to a decision in the next 21 days.

Under fire: Judge Nigel Peters is being investigated for suggesting the victim was 'egging on' paedophile Neil Wilson, and today he was forced to change his sentence because of a technicality but still failed to jail him

The case caused controversy  when 
Robert Colover, the barrister prosecuting in the case, had labelled the 
young girl 'predatory' and 'sexually experienced' and has been suspended
 from similar cases.

Judge Peters then repeated his comments and is also being
 investigated for telling Wilson the girl was ‘egging you on’.

The CPS described Mr Colover's remarks as 'inappropriate' and suspended him from prosecuting sexual offence cases pending a review.

Judge Peters is currently being investigated by the judicial watchdog and this morning decided to extend the sentence to 12 months after ruling two counts of possessing indecent images, for which Wilson was given four months imprisonment suspended for two years, should run consecutively.

He made no reference to the storm surrounding the case during the 10-minute hearing.

Explaining the decision to Wilson, who appeared via videolink from York Magistrates' Court, the judge told him: 'I have had the matter listed before me today as part of the sentence, not that part relating to sexual activity with a child, requires correcting.

'It was not appreciated by the parties that I could not pass a community order with a supervision requirement for three years to run alongside a suspended sentence on the same indictment or indeed another indictment sentenced on the same occasion.

'In amending the sentence I have sought to ensure that all parts of the order will be complied with by the defendant and that any breach will be brought before a court and consideration given to further penalty, including immediate imprisonment.'

'Disgrace': Barrister Robert Colover has been criticised by campaigners for describing a 13-year-old victim of a sex abuse case 'predatory' and was replaced at today's hearing

David Cameron had condemned a prosecution barrister and had urged the courts to ‘stand up for  victims’ after Neil Wilson, 41, escaped jail despite luring the girl to his home, where she performed a sex act on him.

'It isn’t appropriate. We need a 
criminal justice system that stands up properly for victims. The victims
 should always be at the centre of our thinking.

‘The
 CPS themselves have said that this isn’t appropriate, the Attorney 
General is going to look into the case and we need a system that 
properly stands up for victims.’

Child protection campaigners labelled barrister Robert Colover a ‘disgrace’ and called for his dismissal. They also warned that his ‘crass’ comments would stop other young abuse victims from coming forward.

Mr Colover has been suspended from prosecuting sex trials after he told Snaresbrook Crown Court in London that the girl ‘forced’ herself on Wilson, describing her as ‘predatory in all her actions’ and ‘sexually experienced’.

He said: ‘She appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15-year-old. There was sexual activity but it was not of Mr Wilson’s doing.

‘You might say it was forced upon him despite his being older and stronger than her.’

Wilson admitted two counts of making extreme pornographic images and one count of sexual activity with a child. His own solicitor told Monday’s sentencing hearing that the paedophile could still pose a risk to children.

Marilyn Hawes, director of child protection charity Enough Abuse, said: ‘This needs to be nipped in the bud. Are we in 1913 or 2013? Judges and barristers should be removed if they use language like this.

‘Vulnerable witnesses won’t come forward if they are going to be treated this way in court. They are fragile children, they are not just pieces of evidence to be used in a case.'

Emily Thornberry, Labour’s Shadow Attorney General, said: ‘It is appalling that after the scandals of Jimmy Savile and Rochdale these awful Lolita prejudices are still being served up in court, and by the prosecution of all people.’

She has written to the Bar Standards Board to examine whether Mr Colover violated its code of conduct.

Investigation: The Crown Prosecution Service has launched a probe following the case at Snaresbrook Crown Court, which returned there this morning

Charity Victim Support also condemned the teenager’s treatment. Its chief executive Javed Khan said: ‘It is completely unacceptable for victims to be blamed in any way for the abuse they have suffered.

‘The state owes a duty of care to victims and witnesses, which in this case appears to have been woefully neglected. We have strenuously campaigned for cultural change to this often adversarial, aggressive courts system.’

There was further anger as a high profile human rights lawyer appeared to defend the prosecutor’s comments.

Barbara Hewson, a barrister for Hardwicke Chambers, tweeted: ‘It takes two to tango. Disgusting tho’ these men are, frankly the girls are often not much better – and no shrieking martyrs.’

The CPS said: ‘The word predatory in this context should not have been used and is of real concern to the CPS. The Director of Public Prosecutions will be undertaking a review of this case to determine what happened and to decide what action needs to be taken.

The Attorney General’s Office said the case had been drawn to its attention ‘as a possibly unduly lenient sentence’.

The Office for Judicial Complaints said it would consider a number of complaints it had received

Shock: Wilson's crimes led to a suspended sentence where the girl victim was accused of egging him on (posed by model)

Neil Wilson spotted his victim amid the bustle of Romford town centre at the start of March last year.

The 13-year-old girl was playing truant from school and wandering the streets asking strangers for cigarettes.

Wilson
 obliged when she asked him – offering her an entire packet. He then 
took her back to his flat near the town centre for coffee.

The girl allegedly looked around 14 or 15 and acted as if she was older than her years.

However, she was clearly underage – and nearly three decades younger than Wilson who was 39 at the time.

Over the next two weeks the pair enjoyed a brief ‘fling’, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

The
 girl was described by the prosecutor and judge as a ‘sexual predator’. 
But during this time it was Wilson who bombarded her with phone calls 
and text messages as she continued to visit his home, the court heard.

On
 March 20, exactly two weeks after her first visit, the girl went back 
to Wilson’s flat after they agreed to meet. They sat in his lounge and 
talked about their relationship.

Wilson claims at this point he told her they had to stop seeing each other because they would get in trouble.

The
 girl, who was dressed in her school uniform, asked if she could change 
out of it and Wilson left the room. When he returned she had undressed 
and was sat wearing a T-shirt.

Wilson
 claims he asked her to put her clothes on, but she started kissing him 
before touching his genitals. He said he pushed her away and told her he
 did not want to see her any more. At no point did they have sex.

Robert
 Colover, prosecuting, told the court that the sexual activity was ‘not 
of Mr Wilson’s doing’. He added: ‘You might say it was forced upon him 
despite being older and stronger than her.’

The abuse came to light only when the girl told a friend what happened and the police were called.

When officers went to Wilson’s home, they found images of child sexual abuse and videos depicting bestiality on his computer.

Four
 of the images were surreptitiously taken photographs of children in 
play areas or other safe environments showing either underwear or 
varying degrees of nakedness.

There were also 11 sexually explicit images involving horses and dogs.

Wilson told police that he watched hardcore pornography but that he had deleted it from his computer.
