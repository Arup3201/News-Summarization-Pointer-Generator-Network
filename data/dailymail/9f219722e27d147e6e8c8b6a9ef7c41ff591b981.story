Gary Cahill wants to prove a point to his critics after coming under fire for some poor performances at the heart of Chelsea's defence.

England centre back Cahill was widely praised for his water-tight partnership with John Terry last season, and in the early stages of the current campaign, but his ability has been called into question with a few poor performances of late.

Cahill was poor for Chelsea in the New Year's Day 5-3 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane and he allowed Raheem Sterling to run unchecked for Liverpool's goal in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg at Anfield.

But having contributed to keeping Harry Kane quiet and ensuring Chelsea kept a clean sheet to win the cup at Wembley on Sunday, Cahill wants to show his worth all over again.

'I have proved it time and time again. I proved it when I was at Bolton and I got the England call-up. I was told "you can't play for England, you're at Bolton",' Cahill said.

'I proved them wrong. I came to Chelsea and it was "oh, you can't play Champions League, you can't do this, you can't do that" and I proved them wrong.'

Cahill's mixed form has coincided with the emergence of young French defender Kurt Zouma, who has started in place of his more senior rival in some big games of late.

But now the 29-year-old wants to use his time back in the first team to help Chelsea to glory in the Barclays Premier League and Champions League.

'It's that fire in your belly,' he said. 'Although you'd wish not to have it, dealing with criticism is probably what has got me to where I am today. This is no different. I will come out the other end without a shadow like you see today.'

'That 5-3 defeat was a bad day at the office for the team. Certainly since I have been at the club we have been fortunate enough to have positive results against Tottenham.

'It was said before Sunday's game that that result would have no reflection on the final and so it proved. I use it as motivation to prove people wrong time and time again.

'You are not a robot. Up until the halfway point in the season it was no problem – but I have come through it time and time again. It's not the first time I've had have a dip in levels of performance.'
