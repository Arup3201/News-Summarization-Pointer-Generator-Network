Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop was man-handled by angry protesters and had to be protected by her security team as university students ambushed her over cuts to the tertiary education system in Sydney on Friday.

Students from the University of Sydney surrounded Ms Bishop as she walked up stairs to the MacLaurin Hall, chanting 'No Cuts, No Fees, No corporate universities,' while others simply yelled 'shame on you.'

The minister's security and police surrounded her, leading her up the stairs and through a set of double doors out of the firing line.

Minster for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop was shoved by Sydney University students on Friday unhappy with cuts to higher education

Students were protesting the government's announcement in its budget that universities will be able to set their own fees from 2016

The MP visited the university to meet the first group of students travelling to Singapore under the government's New Colombo Plan, which sees undergraduates undertaking study in the Indo-Pacific region.

Bebe D'Souza from the Sydney University Union told the ABC the minister seemed unfazed by the confrontation.

'Julie Bishop came up the stairs surrounded by police and then all of the students kind of surrounded [her] and the police.

The minister quickly made her way up the stairs before she was ambushed

Ms Bishop faced a crowd of protestors chanting 'No Cuts, No Fees, No corporate universities'

'[She] kind of just like looked bemused, she didn't look shameful at all, she looked proud of what she was doing.'

Earlier on Friday, a similar incident during Ms Bishop's address to audience at the opening of the Australia-China Relations Institute at UTS.

A spokeswoman for the minister told The Sydney Morning Herald both Ms Bishop's university engagements on Friday 'proceeded happily.'

Security had to restrain students from trying to reach the doors Ms Bishop had just passed through

Authorities had trouble containing the crowd and keeping the doors shut

'Minister Bishop was at UTS to launch a new Australia-China Relations Institute and at Sydney University to award government-funded opportunities under the New Colombo Plan for 1000 students to study in Asia,' the spokeswoman said.

Students chanted the same lines, before the protest later spilled on to Sydney Univeristy.

On Tuesday during the budget it was announced that universities would be allowed to set their own tuition fees from 2016, and for the first time students will pay real interest on their HECS debts

Students will pay upwards of $120,000 for university degrees and will face more expensive loan repayments under a deregulated fee system, a leading education expert has warned.

Bruce Chapman, who designed the HECS loan scheme, said changes to university funding in the federal budget would see students paying at least two and possibly three times as much for their education.

More than 200 students turned out to oppose student fee deregulation at the University of New South Wales on Wednesday

Professor Chapman, director of policy impact at the Australian National University, said this is likely to see universities increase their tuition fees to international student fee levels, which are currently about three times higher, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

National Union of Students president Deanna Taylor said university fee deregulation was frightening

'I would be very surprised if they're less than double,' Professor Chapman told MailOnline.

'Roughly speaking the average increase will be 100 per cent or more.'

Professor Chapman said the Group of Eight universities would increase the fees as soon as they could 'because they have the market power'.

'The group of eight has wanted this for quite a while and the reason is they know the market will bear it,' he said.

'They're allowed to go up to international charge so that's where they'll go.

'If they think there will be no implications for demand, which I don't think there will be, they'll do it.'

The Group of Eight is made up of The University of Sydney, The University of New South Wales, The University of Queensland, The University of Melbourne, Australian National University, The University of Adelaide, the University of Western Australian and Monash University.

Professor Chapman said the cost of a bachelor of medical science at the University of Sydney could rise from $24,000 to the international student cost of $120,000.

National Union of Students president Deanna Taylor said the changes were frightening.

'And the scariest thing about fee deregulation is that you can't predict how bad it's going to be,' Ms Taylor said.

'It's a devastating outcome for students in rural and regional areas in particular, as well as low socio-economic and indigenous students who already face massive barriers to accessing higher education.'

Under budget changes the higher education loans program will also become less generous, and students will have to pay real interest for the first time.

Currently the rate at which HECS debt grows is indexed at CPI - 2.9 per cent - which means effectively there is no real interest on the debt.

But under the changes the interest rate will be tied to the government bond rate, which is currently sitting at 3.85 per cent.

UNSW students held a mock funeral for education as part of their protest, delivering a coffin to the Chancellery Building

'That's almost a percentage increase overnight,' Ms Taylor said.

'There will be students who will begin their uni degree who won't know what their debt will be.'

The government says it will cap the rate at 6 per cent.

Graduates will also be made to start repaying the loans once they earn $50,638 from mid-2016, almost $700 less than now.

Group of Eight chairman Ian Young said other budget measures would put downward pressure on fees.

'If universities want to charge a premium, they will have to convince students there is a real benefit to what they offer. This will keep us on our toes and force us to innovate,' he told the Herald.

Also announced in the budget was the requirement that universities put $1 from every $5 raised from fee hikes into scholarships for disadvantaged students.

The higher education loans program is set to become less generous, with graduates made to start repaying the loans once they earn $50,638 from mid-2016

Funding will also be expanded to cover the funding of all students taking diploma and sub-bachelor courses.

It's expected expanding places will lead to the government subsidising an extra 80,000 students by 2018 at a cost of $820 million.

Treasurer Joe Hockey said the measures would help improve the quality of university education in Australia.

'Australia should have at least one university in the top 20 in the world, and more in the top 100,' Mr Hockey said while delivering his Budget speech in Canberra on Tuesday.

'The higher education sector is being held back and cannot compete with the best in the world.

'We need to set our sights higher.'
