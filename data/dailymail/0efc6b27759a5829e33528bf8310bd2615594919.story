The Playstation 4 could cost as little as £270 when it launches later this year, according to a report in a Japanese newspaper.

The Asahi Shimbun reports that Sony's new gaming console will cost 40,000 Yen - which translates to about £270.

However, UK gamers will have to factor in VAT, which adds a whopping 20 per cent to the price, taking the possible UK figure to around £325.

Even at that price, the PS4 will be a bargain.

The PS3 cost 60,000 Yen when it launched in Japan 2006.

The new console is expected to be announced at a press conference in New York on February 20.

If the price is as low as the rumours suggest, it could steal a march on Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console, which doesn't yet have a launch date.

Microsoft's console, which could be 
named the Xbox 720,  could be announced at the annual E3 gaming 
conference, held in Los Angeles in June.

And observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony as their next-generation consoles go head-to-head in the vital holiday season market.

The next-generation Xbox console could require gamers to be permanently connected to the internet - ruling out the use of second-hand games, according to a report in Edge magazine.

The next Xbox will 'be absolutely committed to online functionality', says the magazine, quoting sources with first-hand experience of Microsoft's latest console.

Gamers will be required to activate games in the same way as most other software from Microsoft and other publishers is already activated online.

An activation system would check that you are the registered user of the game each time you start it up - you wouldn't even be able to lend it to a friend.

However, the move to an always-on connection raises the possibility of games embracing other pricing models such as those seen on portable devices including smartphones and tablets.

With an always-on connection, games could be very cheap, or even free, but make their profits through in-game purchases of better equipment.

However, rumours suggested yesterday that gamers in the UK could have to wait until next year until Sony's PS4 finally lands on British soil.

A developer told Edge magazine that Sony is planning to concentrate its marketing efforts on its home market in Japan and the US.

The move would be to ensure that Sony can push sufficiently high numbers of the console out to stores for Christmas and not lose sales because of insufficient units being shipped.

All eyes are on the specs for Sony's new console.

Rumours yesterday surfaced that it would be heavily focused on the cloud, which would put the Japanese' firm's purchase last year of a leading cloud-based gaming company into perspective.

Sony paid $380 million for Gaikai in June last year. At the time Sony's chief executive, Andrew House, said: 'By combining Gaikai's resources including its technological strength and engineering talent with SCE's [Sony Computer Entertainment] extensive game platform knowledge and experience, SCE will provide users with unparalleled cloud entertainment experiences.

'SCE will deliver a world-class cloud-streaming service that allows users to instantly enjoy a broad array of content ranging from immersive core games with rich graphics to casual content anytime, anywhere on a variety of internet-connected devices.'

At the time it was reported that Gaikai had been hoping for a buyer to spend around $500 million.

The new console is also expected to have a touchpad controller, as well as an eight-core x64 AMD processor (codenamed 'Bulldozer), 8GB of RAM, 2.2GB of video RAM, four USB ports that use the new high-speed USB 3.0 standard, a Blu-ray drive, a hard drive of 160GB, an Ethernet port, and both HDMI and optical outputs.

Specs for the next-generation Xbox are rumoured to be comparable, with insiders suggesting that it will also pack 8GB of RAM, HDMI connectors and USB 3.0.

The launches are important for both Sony and Microsoft, as gamers have moved away from consoles since the Xbox 360 and the PS3 debuted.

More and more people have shifted to the tablet and the smartphone as a gaming platform.

Analysts expect that tablets and other
 mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games 
consoles within a few years.

Many
 are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the 
exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs.

The slimline PS3 cost 60,000 Yen when it launched in Japan 2006. The next generation PS4 is expected to retail for around 40,000 Yen (about $430)
