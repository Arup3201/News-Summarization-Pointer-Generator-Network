Germany coach Joachim Low has extended his contract by another two years until 2018.

The German Football Federation says the new deal includes the 2018 World Cup in Russia, where Germany would be defending champions if the team qualifies.

Low took over as Germany coach from Jurgen Klinsmann after the 2006 World Cup in Germany. His first title was last year's World Cup in Brazil.

Germany got off to a slow start in qualifying for next year's European Championship in France and trail Poland by three points after four matches.

Low says that 'confirming the title from Brazil remains an incredible challenge and motivation' and that Germany's young team is 'not at the end of its development.'
