Headteachers have said parents should spend less time on the phone to make their children know their views are important

Parents should stop checking their mobiles and listen to their children when they are talking to them, headteachers said yesterday.

They said it is vital that mothers and fathers are not distracted by phones and computers and that they spend time talking and listening to their children so that they know their views are important.

Bernadette Hunter, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘It’s easy for everyone, even parents, to be distracted by the immediacy of electronic communications.

‘We understand the pressure and temptation to respond straight away but it’s important that parents spend time speaking and listening with their children.’

The advice comes in a leaflet published by the NAHT and the Family Action charity, aimed at helping parents to develop their child’s speaking and listening.

It advises: ‘Give your child your attention: Don’t check your mobile phone at the same time as they are talking to you.’‘Switch off television and laptops well before bedtime. Chat or read a bedtime story together instead.’

Other advice includes being patient and not interrupting children, to ask questions, discuss the day, and to try to have a family meal together.

And it suggests that parents praise their child for listening to them and following instructions, while those mothers and fathers who do not have English as their first language should make sure they speak their native tongue ‘confidently and well’.

David Holmes, chief executive of Family Action, said: ‘We all know how easy it is to be distracted by our mobiles when with our children. That’s part of modern life. 

‘But this leaflet is a reminder to  parents about the importance of  making time to listen actively to our children. We all need to do this so that children in turn learn to speak and listen well.’

The leaflet is the second published by the two organisations. The first called for parents to give their children ‘lots of hugs’, play games and ensure youngsters get enough sleep.

They also urged families to eat  dinner together and make time for homework, reading and talking.
