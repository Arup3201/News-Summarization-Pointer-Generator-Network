The devastated husband of a mother-of-four, who was mowed down as she walked hand-in-hand with her youngest daughter, has slammed the judge who allowed his wife's killer driver to walk free from court.

Judge Nicholas Woodward said driver Balbinder Dhillon, 39, was suffering from 'stress' when he ploughed into 42-year-old Donna Davies in Warrington, Cheshire.

Dhillon, who has since suffered with 'post accident amnesia', faced 14 years in jail for the offence - but was handed just 300 hours of unpaid work.

Guilty: Balbinder Dhillon, from Warrington, who was given a suspended 
sentence and community service after pleading guilty to causing death by
 dangerous driving. Despite being eligible for up to 14 years in prison, Balbinder walked free from court due to his 'post accident amnesia'

After the sentencing today at Warrington Crown Court, Mrs Davies' husband Paul, 44, said he was furious with the sentence - and said he had no faith in the criminal justice system.

He said: ‘This just shows how much the British justice system stinks and I have no faith in it whatsoever.

'It’s like giving him a licence to kill. I was half expecting this guy to be awarded a free ticket to Disneyland.’

Mrs Davies was walking with her child after morris dancing practice on April 25, 2013 when the car being driven by Dhillon veered towards them.

Mrs Davies threw her child out of the way just in time - but took the full force of the crash.

She was catapulted into a nearby garden and died instantly.

Robbed: Paul Davies, whose wife Donna was hit by a car as she walked with their youngest daughter, said he feels robbed after her killer driver walked free from court with just 300 hours of community service

In the days before the crash, bankrupt businessman Dhillon had smoked cannabis, taken sleeping tablets and claimed he had blacked out at the wheel of his Audi A4.

Mr Davies, from Warrington, said his ‘happy loving family had gone to nothing but a shell’ since the crash.

He said: 'It’s a farce when someone who puts a nasty comment on Facebook or Twitter and gets years in jail - yet someone who actually takes somebody else’s life can walk free. There seems to be no logic in it.

‘In fact it sends out a message that people can go out and kill someone and then get away with it by saying they can’t remember doing it.

‘The judge seemed more bothered about the defendant’s life and the devastation it will have on him and his family.

‘Yet all the time I was thinking: ‘what about me?’.'

Dhillon, a former director of a landlord and letting agency, was driving home after picking up his two children from kickboxing when the crash took place.

The car, which was travelling between 31 and 34 mph, suddenly drifted across the road and hit Mrs Davies before ploughing into a stone wall. Mrs Davies’ daughter was uninjured in the collision.

Dhillon, who was treated in hospital after the impact, later claimed he had been under stress due to his wife’s depression and his father’s terminal illness.

He also admitted to smoking cannabis on the Sunday and had swallowed some of his wife’s sleeping tablets on the Tuesday - two days before the crash on the Thursday.

Dhillon of Great Sankey, Warrington, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving.

As well as unpaid work, the defendant was handed a two-year suspended jail term and disqualified from driving for five years.

But voluntary worker Mr Davies, who was present in court, said: 'I thought he would go down for at least four years and I was very angry when the sentencing was passed.

'I could feel myself shaking and I had 
to get out of the court room quickly. It seemed the judge couldn’t even 
look me in the eye.

Tributes: Flowers left at the scene of the crash in which Mrs Davies, 42, was killed. Mrs Davies was described as a family orientated-person who was excited about being a grandmother for the first time

'I felt physically sick. The judge said that, if he committed this man to prison, it would be devastating to his family - but what about my family and the devastation it has caused?

'The legal system hasn’t served us - it appears to have served the offender more. On the night it happened, I was at home and I heard all the sirens going past. I even commented on it but at the time I didn’t think anything of it.

'But when Donna didn’t return home I knew something was wrong - I could feel it. Then I got the dreaded knock on the door and the policeman said my wife had been killed instantly. The news was devastating.

Tragic: Scene of the crash where Mrs Davies was killed. The mother-of-four, described as a mother hen, loved baking, walking in the park and taking her children on picnics

'Donna was about to become a grandmother and it would have been her first grandchild. She was a family-orientated person and like a mother hen.

'She loved the kids and did things like baking and walking in the park and picnics. She was a full-time mother.

'I thought this man’s sentencing would give me closure but it feels like I have been robbed of it instead. I made a promise to get justice for Donna and I’m fighting to get the suspended sentence overturned.'

Passing sentence, Judge Woodward told Dhillon: 'You are suffering from post accident amnesia and you have no recollection of the accident itself.

'But, in my judgement, a major factor must have been the amount of stress you must have been under at that time. In particular, the news that you had just been given by your father and, in some way, that must have affected your driving.

'Her (Mrs Davies) family have been absolutely torn apart by what happened and no sentence I give can do anything to remedy that tragedy.'
