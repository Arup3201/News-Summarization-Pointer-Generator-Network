Jurors in the rape trial of two former Vanderbilt football players watched dorm surveillance video on Thursday showing their alleged victim being carried inside and dragged out of an elevator.

Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey are accused of assaulting the 21-year-old unconscious woman in a dorm room in June 2013. Two other football players are also accused in the case.

The surveillance footage, which was discovered when officials were looking into vandalism, prompted the rape investigation.

Vanderbilt police Lieutenant Donnie Harville testified on Thursday that the video showed a male student walking naked out of a bathroom in the coed dorm.

Vandenburg and Batey are the only two suspects who did not strike a plea deal with with prosecutors and plead guilty. The other two defendants are slated to testify against them

Jurors saw a surveillance video that showed the victim being dragged out of an elevator before she was gang raped

It also appeared that no one called police to report concern for the woman, even though the video showed two female students nearby when she was carried inside Gillette House around 2.30 a.m.

'To your knowledge, did she contact anyone out of concern?' defense attorney Worrick Robinson said.

'To my knowledge, no,' Harville said.

The footage did not show any bystanders around when the woman was dragged out of the elevator.

Defense attorneys say the video portrays a culture of binge drinking and promiscuous sex that their clients were caught up in. 

The defense also appears to be trying to convince jurors that no one would have been concerned for the woman because it was commonplace to see students drunk. 

Prosecutors accuse the players of laughing, taking photos and videos while the incapacitated woman was being violated in a dorm room. One is accused of inserting something in her while another egged him on. Another player is said to have had sex with her and urinating on her.

Lieutenant Donnie Harville of the Vanderbilt Police Department testified about the surveillance footage and said that Vandenburg placed a towel over a campus surveillance camera on the morning of the incident

On Wednesday, Harville also testified that Vandenburg placed a towel over a campus surveillance camera on the morning of the incident.

The footage shows the woman lying on the floor of a dorm hallway and being photographed in a compromising position, prosecutors said.

Defense attorneys have said Vandenburg and Batey were drunk despite not being old enough to drink.

Vandenburg, a star player who had recently transferred to Vanderbilt from College of the Desert in California, took the student to a bar called Tin Roof for a date on the night of the alleged attack.

On the ride back, she reportedly passed out in the car and he drove to the dorm, where he ran into the other players. 

During the opening statements, the alleged victim, an Oklahoma native, sat in the audience wiping her eyes with a tissue. She is expected to take the stand as a witness for the prosecution.

Crime scene: Prosecutors say Vandenburg brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where the men egged each other on and proceeded to rape the young woman

Vandenburg and Batey are being tried on five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg is also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. 

The two ex-players not on trial but also charged in the case, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, are expected to testify against Vandenburg and Batey. All have pleaded not guilty.

The trial comes in the midst of a debate about the prevalence of rapes on America's college campuses. The Obama administration has launched a campaign to end sexual assault on university campuses.

Officials at Vanderbilt University did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.
