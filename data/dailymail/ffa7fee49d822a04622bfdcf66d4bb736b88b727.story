'My very own salon called "Billutifuls". I love you so much @andytcarroll I'm one lucky girl #mirrormirroronthewall.' 

With a snap of the pair sat on their pink sofa, she added: 'Our first Christmas in our new home.' 

It is the latest hair-raising experience for Mucklow, after Carroll showed off his flowing locks by striking a pose with his fiance underneath the pair's mirrored ceiling.

The 25-year-old centre forward captioned that snap: 'Good morning from our new home!! #crazyhair #dirtymirror.'
