A premature baby survived after his mother twice defied doctors who told her nothing could be done for her baby and it was ‘going to die’.

Rachel Crockett, 25, was told she was having a miscarriage when her waters broke at 22 weeks and five days.

When scans revealed the baby had a heartbeat, she and her partner, Craig Walkow, said they wanted their baby to be saved.

But they were told by hospital staff that it would be treated as a miscarriage - and that if they wanted to save their child, they would need to find a hospital with the facilities to help under-developed babies.

Rachel Crockett has called for the abortion limit to be lowered from 24 to 20 weeks after her son Connor, with partner Craig Walkow, was born at 23 weeks

Miss Crockett was told she was having a miscarriage when her waters broke at 22 weeks, but scans revealed her baby had a heartbeat. The couple were forced to drive more than 35 miles from Milton Keynes to Oxford after medics said they could not look after a baby born so premature

Miss Crockett, who had been haemorrhaging, then had to lie and say the bleeding had stopped because she was not allowed to transfer to another hospital while it continued.

Her determination to fight for her unborn child meant she was moved from Milton Keynes Hospital in Buckinghamshire to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, 35 miles away.

Her baby, Connor, was born the following day at 23 weeks and two days, weighing 1lb 2oz. Earlier this month he celebrated his first birthday.

Miss Crockett yesterday called on maternity units to do more to save babies routinely considered ‘unviable’.

She also made an emotional plea for the abortion limit to be lowered to take into account the development of foetuses inside the womb and advances in medicine that are allowing more to survive when they do not reach full-term.

Details of her case come a week after it was revealed another premature baby only survived because he was 0.7 of an ounce over the cut-off point at which medics would fight to save his life.

Miss Crockett, from Wing, Buckinghamshire, said: ‘If I had listened to staff at Milton Keynes I would have given up hope and potentially accepted that I would miscarry. 

‘Had I not been transferred because I insisted then he would have died,’ said Miss Crockett

‘It’s always right to be honest with patients but there does need to be more hope and babies need to be given a chance to try and survive.’

She added: ‘I think the abortion limit should be lowered to 20 weeks – especially considering what happened with Connor. By then, you can see their sex – they are a person.’ 

Connor, was born at 23 weeks and two days, weighing 1lb 2oz on October 8, last year. The tiny baby was slipped into something similar to a freezer bag to help regulate his temperature

Miss Crockett, a carer for the elderly who is currently on maternity leave, and Mr Walkow, a 38-year-old groundworker, were in a restaurant when her waters broke.

An ambulance took her to hospital in Milton Keynes where she was told she was about to miscarry. She says she was informed: ‘Your baby is going to die’.

‘We were told to say goodbye to Connor. It felt like the end of the world. We were numb,’ said Miss Crockett.

‘But when we kept going for scans we were told there was still a heartbeat and I was saying if there is still a heartbeat there is still a chance he could live.

‘They said they couldn’t do anything if he was to come. We thought we would never get the baby we always wanted but Craig and I pushed them to ring other hospitals.

‘We were so relieved when John Radcliffe Hospital said they would take us. But I was told I could only be transferred if I stopped haemorrhaging so I had to lie and told them I had. 

‘If I hadn’t lied, Connor wouldn’t be here as he came just the next day.’

The tiny baby was slipped into something similar to a freezer bag to help regulate his temperature when he was born on October 8 last year.

He was then placed in an incubator and spent the first 75 days of his life on a ventilator while his lungs developed.

Overall, he spent seven months in hospital, during which he had a bleed on the brain which, fortunately, mended itself.

He also had fungal meningitis which was treated with antibiotics and three operations for a perforated bowel.

And laser eye surgery was needed to treat a condition caused by the oxygen being pumped into his lungs which meant the retinas were starting to detach from his eyes.

Connor spent a further two weeks in Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, near his home, before finally being allowed home.

His lungs are still developing and he remains permanently on oxygen for the time being but is expected to grow up with no mental or physical disabilities.

Milton Keynes hospital says it has a neonatal unit for babies born after 27 weeks and a neonatal intensive care unit for those born before that.

A spokesman said: 'When a mother has any complications that may necessitate delivery at 23 or 24 weeks, decision around her care are tailored according to her needs and made by consultants. 

'These decisions are based around balancing the risk to the baby being born outside (the intensive care unit), against the risk of the baby being born en-route to another hospital and the likelihood of survival.' 

The British Association of Perinatal Medicine advises hospitals it is best practice for 'resuscitation not be carried out' if a baby is born with complications before they get to 23 weeks. 

Details of Connor's case came a week after it emerged Lucas Moore, one, who was born at 23 weeks and two days, was only given medical care because he weighed 520g – 20g over the cut-off point at Coventry University Hospital.

His parents were then told to consider switching off his life-support because he had a bleed on the brain.

Lucas suffered a number of other complications and spent 109 days in hospital but is now perfectly healthy.
