More than a dozen pets have died in an area of Topeka in several cases of suspected poisoning.

Veterinarians in the Kansas capital are now warning pet owners to keep an eye out after 15 dogs allegedly died from ingesting rat poison.

A veterinary clinic in Topeka put up a sign urging customers to be vigilant and another confirmed at least three cases of rat poisoning.

A sign taped to a counter at Potwin Pet Clinic in Topeka read: ‘FYI: It has been brought to our attention that there have been several cases on the SE side of town of dogs ingesting rat poison that has been thrown into the yard.

‘A white van has been seen throwing white bags into the yards and so far 15 dogs have died from ingesting the poison.

‘Inspect your yards carefully and DO NOT leave your dogs outside at night.’

Staff at Potwin said other clinics had seen incidents involving possibly poisoned animals.

Animal Care Center of Topeka, recently treated at least three cases of rat poisoning, one of them fatal, staff told the Topeka Capital-Journal.

Big numbers: Topeka Police Department received an email last week stating that a veterinary clinic in Topeka had reported 21 cases of rat poisoning, but this appear to have been exaggerated

According to staff, one pet owner had seen someone in a white van throwing food items into gardens in the neighbourhood.

Last week, the Topeka Police Department received an email stating that one clinic in the area had reported 21 cases of rat poisoning.

However, this turned out to be three cases, and police urge pet owners to keep their eye out, but not to panic as the number of cases appears to have been exaggerated.

‘I probably called at least another half dozen or more (vet clinics) and asked if they had had any cases,’ animal control manager Linda Halford said.

‘They said they had not. Things get a little confused when they get passed from person to person.’
