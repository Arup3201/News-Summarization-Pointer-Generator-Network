When the Vista Verde condo complex was first built one of its main selling points was its beautiful ocean views.

Enjoying lunch on the balcony overlooking the California coastline was one of the biggest advantages of living at the Lomita complex.

Now the sea views have been replaced with the sights of coffins and mourners crying after a nearby memorial park started carrying out burial services on a rooftop mausoleum just feet from the apartments.

Residents at a condo complex in California have been left feeling 'upset and frustrated' after a nearby memorial park started carrying out burial services just feet from their apartments

Residents have now warned their properties could decrease in value following Green Hills Memorial Park's decision to move services to the site just 50ft from the complex.

Resident Lane Mayhew, 26, told CBS Los Angeles: 'I've seen many funerals.

'They’ve brought the caskets up this way so everything comes up and down the ramp. It’s sad, it’s upsetting, it’s frustrating, it’s my home.'

Matt Geier said when he first moved into the complex in 2006 he accepted that he could see and hear the services, which were then held at a distance.

But he said his living conditions had changed drastically since the services had moved to just outside his apartment. 

He told the Daily Breeze: 'We’re sitting there eating brunch on the weekends and we have people right outside our window crying their eyes out.' 

Residents have now warned their properties could decrease in value following Green Bay Memorial Park's decision to start holding services on the rooftop mausoleum which lies just 50ft from some of their balconies

Ray Frew, president and CEO of Green Hills Memorial Park, told ABC7 Los Angeles that the mausoleum was built with the city's consent.

He said he had 'never envisioned the level of negative response' from residents but had tried to reduce the noise of the services, put a limit on when services took place and attempted to hide the view from residents with screens.

He said: 'A demand to make me stop doing funerals altogether in a cemetery, or to move a building that was constructed with full approval of the city that we are governed by, that's not a possibility.'

According to WTSP.com, the memorial park has sent the residents a cease and desist letter, demanding they stop disrupting funeral services.

Both parties will be attending the Rancho Palos Verdes Planning Commission meeting on August 12.

Green Hills Memorial Park was founded in 1948 and has since held services for more than 75,000 families. 

According to its website, the memorial park started as a partnership between business owners and members of the local community. It still operates as a not-for-profit organisation.
