The owner of a valet service has been caught red-handed in a moment driving a customer's expensive convertible which was paid to be entrusted to his care - a scene right out of the 1980s movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

Premier Parking Spot in Cocoa, Florida claims to look after customers' cars while they head off on vacation cruises.

However instead of the 2012 Corvette convertible being placed in a secure garage in the Florida location and perhaps being serviced, an undercover investigation found that company owner Jay Nieves had secretly taken the car on a weekend joyride.

An investigation by ABC7 discovered the deception when they handed the fraudster  keys to a $60,000 convertible  - and he found the temptation was too great to resist.

Less than six hours after it had been in the lot, Nieves took the car on the road - all captured on a hidden camera with built-in GPS.

The businessman and a female employee were caught driving the car on the freeway and into his driveway where he took pictures of it with his phone. He later parked it at night outside a restaurant.

Nieves also used the convertible to run errands for three days - at one point piling it high with DIY products and allowing his pet dog to run all over the upholstery.

He even left it unlocked and with the top down in a parking lot for more than 20 minutes.

When
confronted by investigators, he flatly denied that he was joyriding
a customer's car, telling ABC: 'We're not driving anybody's car.'

Even when shown the video of himself behind the wheel, he continued to refute the claims.

No charges have yet been filed against Mr Nieves bu authorities. 

In the 1986 film starring Matthew Broderick, Ferris Bueller convinces his friend Cameron to ‘borrow’ his father’s vintage 1962 Ferrari GT California.

Director John Hughs said in interviews at the time that there were only 100 of those cars ever produced.

In the movie, Cameron is fearful of his father’s retribution after he discovers that they’ve put a few hundred miles on the car’s odometer.

In an effort to ‘undo’ the mileage, Bueller suggests that they run the car in reverse. Cameron kicked the car out of anger, sending it plummeting  into a ravine.
