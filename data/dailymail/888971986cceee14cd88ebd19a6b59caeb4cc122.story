Becoming a little turned around after a pub crawl could now be a thing of the past for barflies in Leeds, as a dedicated drinker has designed a London Tube-style map that charts bars, restaurants and pubs all over the city.

The 'Leeds Oderaround' was created by Steve Lovell, and features a massive 563 locations across the northern city, replacing tube stations with drinking, eating, and lodging establishments.

Mr Lovell, 39, spent over a year of his spare time designing the drinker's guide, using both virtual and physical mapping methods to complete the project.

The 'Leeds Orderaround' map, drawing from the iconic London Underground design, the map details the locations of 563 pubs and bars in Leeds

Steve Lovell, a former graphic design student, took over a year to create the map, walking dozens of miles in his efforts

The former Leeds University graphic design student clocked up dozens of miles walking the city, and taking virtual street tours.

Most of his mapping efforts were to make sure that the pubs he was listing on his map were still open and operational, as many might have been closed or renamed.

Mr Lovell said: 'Having always admired the design of the London Underground map and going out in Leeds, I decided to do this project to combine the two.

the map could easily be used to chart the routes of a pub crawl, or just more easily locate a pub in the city that you've always wanted to try

Steve Lovell plans to sell the maps on his website for £10 each

'It's been over a year in development on and off in my spare time.

'It's been deceptively long and hard work, but I'm very happy with the finished result.

'I've had lots of kind comments about it already and it does make me feel quite proud.

'Friends and neighbours have said that they are really impressed with it and when I had my photograph taken complete strangers came up to me and said they really wanted one.'

Because the project took over a year to complete, Mr Lovell found that many of the sites he had listed at the start had become obsolete, and so his map required constant updating.

Lovell both walked dozens of miles, and used virtual mapping techniques to make make sure that every pub, restaurant and bar was actually open and operational, and that they hadn't changed their name, so that his map was completely correct

He said: 'Since starting the project I've had to remove a lot of pubs that have closed down and even been demolished and that's always sad.

'About a quarter-of-a-mile from my house there was a pub that had been demolished before it had been printed.

'It is quite sad to see so many close and come off the map in the 12 months I have created it.

'But it is also nice to see that some new places are also opening up, but mostly in the city centre.

'When I was putting it together there were lots of places that I wouldn't know about and places that I never even knew existed.

'I can't say I've been to all of the places on the map and probably never will, but I've been to lots of places I didn't know about before as a result of researching and designing this.'

Lovell's maps cost £10 and are available from www.albanydesign.co.uk.

A pub crawl, the act of going from one bar to another, drinking more and more drinks on a per-determined route, is a popular British pastime.

But the hobby can be dangerous.

Groups of people drinking strong drinks, with the peer pressure culture of 'downing' drinks meaning that people are stumbling out of bars and into streets to head to the next place, where they are at risk of being hit by cars.

This danger was shown in Leeds last year when the former boyfriend of Kelly Brook, Rugby ace Danny Cipriani, drunkenly tumbled into the road while on a pub crawl, and was hit by a bus.

Cipriani was treated in Leeds General Hospital, and was pictured days later hobbling out on crutches with various cuts and bruises from his accident.

According to eyewitnesses, him and friends had been taking on the Leeds 'Otley pub crawl', featuring 14 different drinking locations.

One landlord said Cipriani and friends had been 'necking' drinks, with one landlord noting that they had spent £200 in 15 minutes on beer and shots.

Later, he collided with the bus, and with an eyewitness commenting: 'Every bit of the bus front window was smashed to pieces, imagine what the guy looks like.'
