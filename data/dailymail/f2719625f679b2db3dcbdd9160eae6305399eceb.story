Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin lashed out at D.C. journalists and politicos on Saturday, calling them all 'a**clowns' for partying at the annual White House Correspondents' dinner.

'That #WHCD was pathetic,' Palin, the former governor of Alaska, tweeted at 10:15 p.m. 'The rest of America is out there working our a**es off while these DC a**clowns throw themselves a #nerdprom.'

Palin, who likely watched coverage of the dinner on television, may have just upset that she didn't get any invitations to this year's events.

She certainly had no harsh words for the dinner two years ago, when she attended two star-studded after-parties - one hosted by Bloomberg and Vanity Fair and the other hosted by MSNBC. She was also spotted the morning of the dinner at multimillionaire Mark Ein's Georgetown abode for an exclusive brunch.

Her daughter, Bristol, attended the after-parties with her mother and Bristol was also spotted at a pre-party thrown by Time, CNN, People magazine and Fortune that year.

Palin's Twitter remark was retweeted 2,407 times and it was 'favorited' nearly 1,000 times.

In a Facebook post, she expanded on her criticism of the dinner, saying, 'Yuk it up media and pols. While America is buried in taxes and a fight for our rights, the permanent political class in DC dresses up and has a prom to make fun of themselves. No need for that, we get the real joke.'

The post garnered more than 44,000 'likes.'

The dinner has become a target of criticism over the years as media companies compete for the most high-profile guests, many of them celebrities. 

In that vein, many say the dinner - which has been a tradition since the 1920s - is now less a celebration of the work that reporters do in covering the administration, and more of an opportunity for media and politicians to schmooze with Hollywood's biggest stars.

Some journalists, such as Tom Brokaw, have refused to attend the dinner as its list of attendees from Hollywood expands. 

'Somewhere along the line, it began to freewheel out of control,' Brokaw told Politico of the dinner. The 'breaking point' for him, he said, was Lindsay Lohan's attendance last year as a guest of Fox News' Greta Van Susteran.
