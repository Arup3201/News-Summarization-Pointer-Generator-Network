Kieran Read blushes when asked what he made of Zinzan Brooke’s recent description of him as a ‘miracle man’.

The current IRB world player of the year may be a snarling brutish figure on the pitch, feared and revered in equal measure by opponents, but off it he is humble, self-deprecating and softly-spoken. Shy even.

‘It’s high praise to hear something like that from someone like Zinzan Brooke,’ Read said on Wednesday when asked about the former All Black No 8’s comments.

‘He was someone I grew up watching and I know how much he achieved in the game. I just love playing the game and being able to express myself on the field. There are parts of my game I feel I’ve improved a lot and can add value to the team. But working miracles? No.’

Despite his humility, there is no escaping Read’s status as one of the greats of the world game. Capped 70 times already and a key figure in the All Blacks 2011 World Cup winning side, the 29-year-old will take on England at Twickenham on Saturday in the prime of his already outstanding career.

Worryingly, the 6ft 4in 17st 4lb No 8 with the pace and footballing skills of a top-class centre, is pursuing a path of constant improvement. Barcelona’s gifted forward Lionel Messi, along with his All Black team-mate and captain Richie McCaw, are sources of constant inspiration for Read.

‘To me when I look at a great player it is the consistency that sets them apart,’ he said. ‘The greats are the ones who do it every week. If you look across sports someone like Lionel Messi scores goals every week, no matter who he’s playing against.

‘You have to have that mentality to start with and then once you’ve got that I think it’s about nailing your preparation and respecting every week you play.

‘That’s what I try to do. I grew up playing alongside Richie for Canterbury Crusaders and the All Blacks so it wasn’t too hard for me to switch into that kind of mind-set when you train alongside him every week.

‘I probably always had that work-rate and mentality inside myself but once you start working and training alongside someone like Richie you see the level he lives up to every week. I just want to keep on improving and keep on getting better. That drives me on every day.’

New Zealand's World Cup-winning captain Richie McCaw has been a mentor for Read throughout his career

Read knows he will be tested by England’s young pretender Billy Vunipola at Twickenham on Saturday, but after missing the first two Tests against Stuart Lancaster’s men following back-to-back concussions last summer, he is grateful just to be taking the field.

He admits his wife Bridget still has concerns about the possibility of her husband sustaining the sort of head knocks that have blighted McCaw’s career and ended that of former All Black full back Leon MacDonald.

‘It was a scary time with all the nausea and dizziness,’ Read said. ‘I know (England lock) Geoff Parling is going through it at the moment. You have a heightened risk after you’ve had one concussion.

‘Even though I wasn’t showing any symptoms obviously the brain wasn’t quite right. You just get unlucky sometimes. It puts things in perspective when you have to take that time off. It makes you realise why you love playing this game and why I love being part of this team. I missed a couple of Tests and it’s not very nice when you have to watch the boys run out and you’re not part of it.

Read struggled with concussion earlier this year and missed the first two Test against England in June

‘My wife is worried I guess. But she let me do it (come back) and she knew I was being looked after by the medics. But for me there was no way I was going to put myself at risk. I’ve got a great family with two little girls now. I was never going to be risking my health in that way. I needed to make sure I was right and come back ready. I’m good to go now. Sweet as.’

Read - part of the All Black team that lost at Twickenham two years ago - returned for the third Test in Hamilton as Steve Hansen’s men completed a 3-0 series whitewash with easily their most comprehensive victory of an otherwise competitive series.

But did Lancaster’s men do enough to convince an eternally cynical New Zealand rugby public that England are finally trying to embrace a more expansive game-plan?

‘I think the public probably see the English as the English of old in terms of that arrogant tag and just playing a kicking game and whatever,’ Read says with a smile.

‘But on the evidence of what we’ve seen in the last couple of years they are not really like that. They’re a capable side.

‘They came with a game plan to really take it to us in June. They had chances, in the first Test especially. We respected them, certainly, from the way they had been playing. From our point of view we probably didn’t play our best but we got the job done, which is pretty important in Test matches. That’s a confidence we can take in to the game on Saturday.’

Confidence is the last thing Lancaster and his men want coursing through this particular All Blacks veins. A humble Read is quite dangerous enough. A miracle man, no less.
