A waterfront complex in WA could soon boast the largest and most expensive apartment in Australia.

Negations are underway to sell a $25 million dollar luxury penthouse in the Mardalup complex, East Perth, in an off-market deal which would beat the previous record of $21 million

The 1900sqm, two-storey apartment contains eight bedrooms, an eight-car garage, three kitchens and a gym, reports Yahoo News.

Developer Ian Johnson and his wife have decided to sell the property in an off-market deal, after Realestate 88 agent Brent Compton said offers had been made between $25 million and $30 million.

Mr Johnson personally designed the eight-bedroom, eight-bathroom apartment, and even lived there himself for a month. 

It also offers three kitchens, a study, a soundproof cinema, a gym and cellar.

He had previously designed the Subiaco Mews complex as well as some other prominent developments in Broome, however he keeps a low profile.

The penthouse has no roads between the building and the river, offering unique opportunities for residents: 'you can throw a fishing line off the balcony,' Mr Johnson said

Three other apartments in the Mardalup complex are on the market for $8 million and $9.5 million each, creating publicity that could raise the selling value of the property.

The penthouse has no roads between the building and the river, offering unique opportunities for residents:  'you can throw a fishing line off the balcony,' Johnson said.

The property is also connected to popular hospitality spots by a set of footbridges.

The current national record for an apartment is $21 million at Bondi Beach, which sold last week .

This offered four bedrooms, a lift, a spa and a 40 metres distance from Bondi Beach.
