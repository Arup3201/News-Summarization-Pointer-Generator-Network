This is the terrifying moment a climber hung from a wall of ice inches away from a powerful waterfall.

Defying the elements, Will Gadd hiked himself up 460 feet of icicles at Helmcken Falls in British Columbia, Canada.

The stunning climb is believed to be the toughest mixed route in the world.

Perilous: Will Gadd, 47, was hauling himself up a wall of icicles for eight hours in Helmcken Falls, British Columbia, Canada, after three weeks of planning

Hanging next to a waterfall, Mr Gadd, a prolific climber from Alberta, Canada, had to use all his strength to keep on track - but broke his index finger in the process

After three weeks of planning, it took prolific climber Will Gadd more than eight hours to complete.

Temperatures dropped to as low as -35C during the climb, which would be regarded as severe in Antarctica.

But the region is notorious for fluctuating conditions, and Mr Gadd, 47, spent the entire expedition in fear of the icicles melting.[related]

During the extreme climb, he broke his index finger, and one of the three other members in his team dislocated her rib. Had it been any other climb in the world, he would have stopped for safety reasons.

Will, from Alberta, Canada, said: 'Even for experienced ice and mixed climbers, Helmcken Falls is really off the charts - it's a new frontier.

Precarious: As the area is notorious for fluctuating conditions, Mr Gadd spent the expedition in fear of the icicles melting

The waterfall is so powerful it has formed a dent in the ground, and snow continued to fall throughout the trip

During the trip, one of Mr Gadd's three teammates dislocated her rib. But they ploughed through as this climb is 'a new frontier'

The climb is widely regarded as the hardest mixed-terrain trek. Mr Gadd said it was the climb of his life and the team managed to do it safely

'Every new frontier in sports is exciting and often dangerous. Helmcken is certainly both.

'One of the unique problems at Helmcken Falls is that it sits right on the border between the ocean air mass and the interior air mass, so the temperatures can either be frigid, or warm up well above freezing in a matter of hours.

'For me, it was the climb of my life, and I'm really happy my team and I did it safely.

Helmcken Falls sits on the border between land and ocean, meaning the temperatures can rise or drop within a matter of hours

Temperatures dropped to -35C, which would be regarded as severe in Antarctica. Mr Gadd admitted he wouldn't do the climb again

At the top: When he reached the top, Mr Gadd had a well-earned rest in the Helmcken Falls lodge

'One of the really cool things about Helmcken is that you can see it clearly from a visitor's viewpoint.

'It's one of the most amazing places in the world, and yet you can sleep in a real bed at the Helmcken Falls Lodge at night.

'I just don't want to climb there anymore - it's never good to trust your luck too much.'

Using a couple of wires, a pick and an axe, these daredevils threw caution to the wind by heaving themselves up perilous cliffs of ice.

Albert Leichtfried and Benedikt Purner beamed at cameras as their feet dangled hundreds of feet above a life-threatening drop.

The usually fast-flowing waterfalls in the Dolomites in Italy and the far north of Norway were frozen solid when temperatures in those areas plummeted below -20C.

The climbers had to dodge deadly hanging ice curtains made of dagger-like icicles as they ascended.

They hiked up icefalls ranging from 300ft to 659ft tall. The highest frozen waterfall the pair climbed was Storfossen in Norway which is taller than London’s iconic Gherkin skyscraper.

Most of the waterfalls climbed by the pair were categorised ‘grade five’, meaning they were near-vertical, requiring sustained climbing and offering little rest.

Mr Leichtfried, 37, of Innsbruck, Austria said: 'Climbing on frozen water must appear quite mad to someone who is not an experienced climber. But I have been ice climbing for 20 years so it seems normal to me.

'Ice climbing carries with it more risks than climbing indoors or even up rocks. Climbing in cold weather is more dangerous as there are different alpine risks, like avalanches.

'With ice you can tell when it is dangerous by the colour. If it is bright white then it is safe to climb, but a blue colour indicates the ice is less stable.'

'Climbing on frozen water must appear quite mad to someone who is not an experienced climber. But I have been ice climbing for 20 years so it seems normal to me,' Mr Leitchfeld said. Klaus Kranebitter, who was taking photos of their expedition, said they were concentrating intently but had a lot of fun wildly hanging of cliffs

Mountain guide Klaus Kranebitter, 40, took photographs of the pair during their daring ascent.

He said: 'Albert and Benedikt have a lot of respect for the ice. They knew the risks.

'They were concentrating deeply and a little bit nervous, which helped keep them aware of the dangers.'

The team have been on several climbing expeditions since January 2013.
