A mother who was so addicted to sugar she consumed the equivalent of 50 teaspoons a day has told how kicking the habit has transformed her life.

Nikki Oakley ate chocolate biscuits for breakfast, substituted supper with puddings and raided the sweet cupboard during years of overindulgence to satisfy her cravings.

Yesterday, the 45-year-old said that while her sugar habit did not cause her weight to balloon, it was an ‘emotional crutch’ that she turned to for a pick-me-up or even because she was bored.

The mother-of-two said her addiction 
was so severe that when she quit sugar she would often burst into tears 
and was short-tempered, listless and depressed. She also suffered severe
 headaches.

‘It took a 
fortnight for those feelings to subside,’ she said. ‘Everywhere I looked
 there were people eating bags of sweets, ice-creams and drinking fizzy 
drinks. Shopping was torture. I would walk up the aisles looking at the 
biscuits, feeling like crying, I wanted them so much.

‘It was a cycle – I ate sugary foods as a pick-me-up, but after the high came a low and I would need more.

‘But once I’d got through those first few weeks I started to feel so much better – calmer but more alert and with more energy.’

In
 the old days, if Mrs Oakley did have proper meals they consisted of 
sugar-laden cereal bars for breakfast, sandwiches with crisps and cake 
for lunch and processed ready meals for dinner with dessert.

Occasionally
 she would cook a curry or sweet and sour dish but the sauce would be 
from a jar and therefore high in sugar. Throughout the day she would 
snack on cookies, pies, sweets and chocolate bars. She would also sip on
 fizzy drinks all day.

Now,
 however, she has porridge for breakfast, chicken or ham salad for lunch
 and snacks on oatcakes with low-fat hummus, berries and natural yoghurt
 sprinkled with nuts or raisins. Instead of relying on microwaveable 
meals for dinner, she cooks curries, stir-fries and spaghetti bolognese 
from scratch without sauces from jars.

And
 Mrs Oakley, who works as a childminder and lives in Redditch, 
Worcestershire, with electrician husband Glyn, also 45, has cut  out 
puddings completely. She  had always jogged and now she is running 
faster than ever. Her weight has also dropped from 9st 11lb to 8st 7lb.

To
 help her change her ways, Mrs Oakley contacted The Healthy Employee, 
which works with companies to educate workers on diet and wellbeing to 
improve health and cut absenteeism. Its specialists deemed her a sugar 
addict.

Anna Mason, who runs
 the company, warned yesterday that sugar could be ‘more powerful than 
any opiates’ and said Britain is ‘hooked on processed food’. She added: 
‘Many people on an apparently healthy diet can be consuming 40 to 50 
teaspoons of sugar a day eating things like granola bars – which are 
held together with sugary syrup – or baked beans, which have sugar in 
the sauce.’

Mrs Oakley has been on a  no-sugar diet since last September because even the smallest amount can reignite her cravings.

However,
 she admitted that she has occasionally been unable to resist temptation
 and recently had a gingerbread biscuit when baking with the children 
she cares for.

She said of 
her addiction: ‘It takes hold after the first few mouthfuls of intense 
pleasure – I would start putting food into my mouth, even though I don’t
 really want it.

‘Your head is telling you to stop, but you just can’t.’

The
 recommended daily sugar intake for a woman is six teaspoons, according 
to the World Health Organisation, but the typical Briton will consume 
double that.

At a time when 
obesity and diabetes cost the UK more than £5billion a year, campaign 
group Action on Sugar is calling on food manufacturers to cut the sugar 
in their products by 20 to 30 per cent within the next three to five 
years.
