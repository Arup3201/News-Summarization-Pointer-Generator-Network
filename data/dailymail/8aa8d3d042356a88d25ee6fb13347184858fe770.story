A World Health Organization doctor who spent 31 days in Nigeria says its no surprise that someone has finally been diagnosed with Ebola on U.S. soil, and that more cases will follow if drastic changes aren't made.

Dr. Aileen Marty was worried specifically about the lax standards for checking people on entry to the U.S., illustrating the point with a story about her return to the country through Miami International Airport.

'I get to the kiosk...mark the fact that I've been to Nigeria and nobody cares, nobody stopped me,' she said.

Marty recounted her experiences in an interview with Fusion's Jorge Ramos.

'Not a single test?' Ramos asked.

'Nothing,' she said.  

The White House has only recently announced additional screening measures will be put in place to check passengers entering the U.S. from countries hit by Ebola. 

Five of the country's major airports will be the first to implement the new measures, including John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, Liberty International Airport in Newark, Dulles International near Washington D.C., Chicago's O'Hare International, and Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. 

To date, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has claimed more than 3,400 lives and infected over 7,000.

Thomas Eric Duncan was the first Ebola patient in the U.S. to be diagnosed with the disease on Sept. 30 in Dallas. He died on October 8. He had only recently returned to the U.S. from Liberia. 

Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas was one of the team of medical staff who treated Thomas Duncan at the Dallas hospital before he died from the dreaded virus last week. 

She was confirmed on Sunday as having contracted the virus from 'patient zero' and was in a stable condition in an isolation ward on Monday.

'If we don't change our entry method and this outbreak continues to get completely out of control...it's likely to be seen in other countries,' Marty said. 

Marty said she had seen horrific conditions in her time in Nigeria, including open sewers, terrible pollution, and poverty, but that there were also people eager to help stamp out the epidemic. 

She said the real tragedy of the outbreak is that no one detected when it first started in December of 2013 then spread out from 'that little zone' until it was 'way too late.'
