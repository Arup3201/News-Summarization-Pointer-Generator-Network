Armed police stormed into a house and forced its residents to lie on the ground at gunpoint, only to realise they had entered the wrong property.

Bungling officers were searching for an armed gang after a security guard reported that a shot had been fired in the area.

But they pounced on the wrong group, who were startled to be confronted as they enjoyed drinks in their garden.

The innocent housemates said they were dragged out of the house and ordered to lie on the ground with their hands behind their backs as officers pointed guns at their heads.

Police admitted they had the wrong house after they searched the property and couldn't find a weapon.

Lukasz Zuk, who shares the house in Haverhill, Suffolk, with a group of friends said he felt 'very ashamed' at being dragged out in the street in full view of neighbours.

He said: 'We were just having a good time, sitting in the garden having a few drinks.

'We saw a helicopter flying over but we did not know what was happening.

'Then they shouted for everyone to come out one at a time from the garden.

'The policeman told us that they know it was not us, but we feel very ashamed because everyone in the street was outside.

'People were taking pictures and we are on Facebook, but we want people to know that we have done nothing wrong.'

Housemate Caroline Stawujak said: 'The policeman was pointing the gun at my head.

'I was supposed to go to work today but I did not feel very well after this.

Presence: Neighbours said they saw a police helicopter circling before three cars of officers arrived

'I am really ashamed because everyone knows about it and thinks there was a gun here, but it was just a mistake.'

Neighbours said they saw a police helicopter circling before three cars taking officers to the scene arrived.

Insp Peter Ferrie, of Suffolk Police, said armed response units were sent to Haverhill from Ipswich and Bury St Edmunds.

It followed a report from a security guard, who said he had seen a group with a gun in the area and that a shot had been fired.

Insp Ferrie said: 'Firearms officers were called, an address was contained and several people were searched.

'No trace whatsoever was found of a firearm and no-one else in the area is believed to have seen or heard a firearm discharged.

'We cannot be sure if this was a genuine incident.'
