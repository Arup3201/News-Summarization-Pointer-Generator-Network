Claims: Sofia Arif claimed her husband, accountant Arif Anwar Zar, ran the family finances with an iron grip and hid his money behind 'sham debts' to friends and a son from his first marriage

The estranged wife of a multi-millionaire claimed today he faked bankruptcy to dodge a divorce payout as she begged a court to protect 'financially weaker spouses' in break ups.

Sofia Arif claimed her husband, accountant Arif Anwar Zar, ran the family finances with an iron grip and hid his money behind 'sham debts' to friends and a son from his first marriage.

Mr Zar, 56, who denies the accusations, declared himself insolvent with debts totaling £2.3million, four months after his wife - who his 20 years his junior- filed for divorce in June last year.

However, his wife’s barrister, James Ewins, claimed all but £400,000 of that is owed either to his adult son from a previous marriage or to two 'friends'.

He told the judges: 'The husband has relied in his bankruptcy on at least £1.9million of sham debts allegedly owed by the husband to his own son, Raziz Rehan (from a previous marriage), and two friends.

'It is the wife’s case that most, if not all, of what Raziz Rehan claims to own is in fact held by him for his father, and his father can call on it whenever he wants.'

Telling the judges that Mr Zar also claims his half of the former matrimonial home is beneficially owned by his son, Mr Ewins said.

'This is a case of a true pater familias who owns all the family wealth no matter in whose name it is held.

'In the absence of the sham debts, the husband would not have been balance sheet bankrupt because he would have remaining assets of at least £1.6million.

Venue: The hearing, at the Royal Courts of Justice, followed an appeal by Mr Arif against a judges order that the challenge to his bankruptcy be heard before a divorce judge, rather than a specialist commercial judge

'The husband had made a thinly veiled threat that he would make himself bankrupt and that, in doing so, he knew exactly what he was doing.

'The husband and his creditors are, on the wife’s case, perpetrating a fraud against her, an innocent third party in the bankruptcy... none of that is surprising but neither is it fair or just,' the barrister added.

The hearing followed an appeal by Mr 
Arif against a judge’s order that the challenge to his bankruptcy be 
heard before a divorce judge, rather than a specialist commercial judge 
in the High Court Chancery Division.

Asking for the issue to be decided by a family judge, Mr Ewins said the i'nquisitorial' nature of the divorce courts would subject Mr Zar’s financial dealings to deeper 'scrutiny'.

Lord Justice Thorpe allowed the husband’s appeal at the end of a half-day hearing, with reasons to be given at a later date.

Mrs Arif’s bid to have her husband’s bankruptcy annulled will now be heard by a Chancery judge, separately from her financial claim in the divorce courts. Both hearings are expected to go ahead later this year.
