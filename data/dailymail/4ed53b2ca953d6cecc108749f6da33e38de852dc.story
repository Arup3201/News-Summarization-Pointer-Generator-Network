Crumbling in a heap in the middle of a field, these giant dishes once stood as a key defence during the Cold War.

The RAF Stenigot was one of 20 vital relay centres which enabled NATO commanders communicate across the globe as relations the Soviet Union disappeared behind an Iron Curtain and the threat of nuclear war grew.

But now the giant parabolic dishes have been allowed to fall into disrepair in a farmer's field in rural Lincolnshire - a distant relic of the clash between East and West.

Defence: RAF Stenigot had been strategically crucial since the outbreak of World War II

RAF Stenigot had been of vital strategic importance during World War II.

The base had been part of a series of radar antennae called the Chain Home radar network.

This provided long range early warning for raids from Luftflotte V and the northern elements of Luftflotte II along the approaches to Sheffield and Nottingham and the central midlands.

These early warning systems used radar
 waves to detect enemy German planes within 30 miles - allowing British 
fighters to be scrambled in time to intercept them.

But years after the end of the war, the site was upgraded, the large antennae dismantled and replaced by the giant 60-ft-wide parabolic dishes were installed as a massive upgrade.

Cold War: The giant 60-foot-wide metal dishes went on to be used for Cold War spying against Russia during the 1950's

For the next three decades, RAF Steniot become a key link in a communications network used by NATO during the 
height of the Cold War.

Bradford student Jonathan Tattersall, 22, travelled to the Lincolnshire field to report on this giant piece of wartime history.

'I first saw the dishes on urban exploring site and I had to go for a look myself' he said.

'It
 was really interesting after reading about what the site was for, and 
then turning up and looking at the scale of these dishes and imagining 
what the site would have looked like a few decades ago.

'To see the dishes lying on the ground in a farmer’s field is a real reminder of what the site used to be.'

Even though most of the site was demolished in 1996, the cost of removing the dishes was thought to be too much, meaning they still lie in the field today.

Mr Tattersall said: 'Before describing what they are they are to those who haven’t seen the RAF base before, people are often bemused and fascinated by them.

'If you aren’t aware of the RAF history, you simply don’t know that these amazing dishes exist.'
