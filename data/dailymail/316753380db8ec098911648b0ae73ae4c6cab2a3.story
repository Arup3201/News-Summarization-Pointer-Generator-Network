A 15-year-old orphan, who has been bounced around the foster care system his entire life, stood in front of a church congregation last month and made a simple plea - for someone to be his family.

Davion Navar Henry Only nervously stood before worshippers at Florida's St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church and said: 'My name is Davion and I've been
 in foster care since I was born... I know God hasn't given up on me. 
So I'm not giving up either.

'I'll take anyone. Old or
 young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be 
really appreciative. The best I could be.'

Davion Navar Henry Only told the congregation at Florida's St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church that he didn't mind who the parents were who adopted him because he would be 'really appreciative'

Davion spoke quietly in front of the full pews wearing an over-sized, donated suit that had come from his latest foster home.

The boy was born while his mother was in jail and has spent his entire childhood in countless foster homes. 

It was his idea to approach the St Petersburg church to find his own adoptive parents and take control of his future. In three years time when he turns 18, he is aware that he will be on his own. Davion will turn 16 on February 12 next year.

He told his caseworker Connie Going that he knows his adoptive parents are out there somewhere.

In June, Davion had come to terms with the death of his mother after he used his birth certificate to search for her for the first time.

He found her mugshot from her arrests for petty theft and cocaine. And then he found her obituary. 

La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud had died aged 55 in Clearwater, Florida just weeks before. 

The 15-year-old has spent the past few years at Carlton Manor residential group home in Eckerd, living with 12 other teenage boys, all suffering their own problems.

Looking for a family: 15-year-old Davion spoke to the church congregation about how badly he wanted a family to care about him

He longs to play football but has no one to take him to practice; to be able to use the bathroom without someone unlocking a door. He would like the light left on when he sleeps.

Davion's portrait is one of many in the Heart Gallery - an organization which helps children in foster care find moms and dads.

Each child has a small profile telling prospective parents something about who they are.

Each article begins with an ID number from the foster care system and the words 'I am available'.

Davion, who is pictured smiling on the beach and throwing a basketball in the air, writes that his favorite school subject is science and that when he grows up he wants to be a police officer.

He likes to eat 'Chinese Food or Buffets' and enjoys football and basketball along with video games, hand held games, cards and watching Cartoon Network. When it comes to his friends, Davion looks for those who are true to themselves and to him.

On his ideal family, the teenager says he doesn't care if the people are rich or poor or what ethnic background they are from. He would like a family 'who are nice, fun and that know how to cook!'

The 15-year-old also gives a short description of what he is like for any family out there. 

Davion writes that he is: 'Nice and fun and would be happy to be adopted! Davion says the nicest thing he has ever done is a save a boy from drowning.'

The teenager has had 
behavioral problems - struggling with his own anger at the circumstances
 in which he finds himself.

Dealing
 with his mother's death has led Davion to believe that he doesn't want 
to be angry anymore - he wants to discover a better life.

He has spent the summer studying hard in 10th grade - achieving As in all but one subject - geometry. He has lost 40lb and tries to let go of his anger.

Davion also has support from his mentor Richard Prince, 22. The two got paired up through the One Church One Child program and usually go to a park to play basketball or talk.

Floyd Watkins, program manager at Davion's group home, told Naplesnews: ''He's come a long way. He's starting to
 put himself out there, which is hard when you've been rejected so many 
times.'

The newspaper reported that as of this week, two couples had made inquiries about Davion but he is still in the foster care system.
