Thomas Beatie, the transgender male who received international attention back in 2007 when he became pregnant through artificial insemination, has been arrested.

Beatie is said to have been stalking an ex, going so far as to place a GPS device on her car.

What's more, Beatie admits to putting the GPS device on the car, saying he even changed the batteries several times.

Victim?: It seems that Thomas was likely stalking ex-wife Nancy (above), who he is in the process of divorcing

TMZ reports that Beatie was picked up Thursday morning in Phoenix, Arizona and is  currently being held in Maricopa County Jail without bail on one charge of stalking an ex.

The ex is most likely his former wife, Nancy Beatie, who he filed for divorce from in 2012.

Earlier this year Thomas had accused Nancy of verbally assaulting him and his new girlfriend, Amber Nicholas.

Thomas and Nancy were married in Hawaii in 2003, and have three children, all of whom Thomas gave birth to.

A judge just granted the two the right to get divorced in August of this year, a divorce that had previously been denied as it was not viewed as legal by some courts.

Maricopa County Family Court Judge Douglas Gerlach had ruled that Arizona's ban on same-sex marriages prevented Mr Beatie's marriage from being recognized as valid.

Gerlach said he had no jurisdiction to approve a divorce because there's insufficient evidence that Beatie was a man when he got married. The judge said the Beaties never provided records to fully explain what Mr Beatie actually had done and not done to become a man. The ruling also noted that Mr Beatie had halted the testosterone treatments. 

That all changed when Judge Kenton D. Jones said in a 12-page opinion, 'As the Beaties' Hawaii marriage was lawfully entered in Hawaii and is not deemed void by Arizona law, the marriage is valid within this state.'

Had their appeal not gone through, the couple would have been forced to go to Hawaii to get a divorce.
