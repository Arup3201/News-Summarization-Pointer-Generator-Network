There's nothing like the cry of 'Come on me lovelies! Apples 'n' pears! Ten for a paand!' to liven up a market.

But in Scunthorpe the bureaucrats like things a little less clamorous.

Council officials have caused fury by banning stallholders from pitching their goods.

Barmy: Traders at Scunthorpe Market, pictured, have been banned from yelling out their prices over 'elf and safety fears they could damage people's hearing

Ever since trading began, sellers have
 shouted out their prices to attract customers. But strict rules on 
'calling off' detailed in a council traders' charter have led to a 
greengrocer being taken to court, banned from his market for three 
months and hit with a £980 legal bill.

Simon Stanley's offence was to shout out his prices at his indoor market stall.

Several butchers have also been given
 written warnings for verbally hawking their wares and the 70 traders at
 Scunthorpe Market are refusing to recognise the  controversial 
'charter' – which even has a section on what 'banter' is allowed.

The rules – imposed without any 
discussion – state stallholders can only 'call off' after 1pm on 
Saturday. The market is open six days a week and for the rest of the 
time all shouting is banned.

New rules imposed in a so-called Traders' Charter prevent 70 traders flogging their wares in the market - a rule that traders warn could impact heavily on their sales

The only reason given for the baffling clampdown is to 'prevent annoyance to other traders'.

Mr Stanley, 45, who has been running 
his greengrocer's stall with wife Trudi, 39, for three years, was 
monitored by council investigators who detailed 16 incidents of him 
breaking the rules by 'calling off'.

The father of four was taken to county
 court three weeks ago and a three-month injunction was imposed, banning
 him from the market until December 12.

He said: 'It's lunacy. I have been 
shouting for three years here and never had a  single complaint from a 
member of the public. Shouting out the prices of our goods is part of 
the atmosphere of a market.'

Julia Murray, 47, from the Scunthorpe
 Traders Association, said all the traders had been given the 'charter' 
to sign and no one had done so.

She said most in the food hall depended on pitching to sell perishable goods near the end of their shelf life.

North Lincolnshire Council said it could not comment on cases involving individual traders.

A spokesman added: 'Calling off and 
pitching is part of market life and is permitted as long as it follows 
guidelines set out in the charter.'
