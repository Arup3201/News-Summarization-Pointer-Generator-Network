Vintage steam trains powered their way through the English countryside today to put the wheels in motion for ten days of celebrations of the world's busiest heritage route.

The magnificent locomotives were on show as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway began celebrating its 40th anniversary.

The historic line first ran trains along its route in 1836 but was closed following the Beeching report into Britain's railways in 1963 which saw 2,300 stations taken out of service.

This 45407 Lancashire Fusilier is among the visiting engines at the first weekend of the 40th anniversary celebrations in North Yorkshire

Today a 62005 K1 Class and a British Rail LNER were seen side-by-side on the line in the North Yorkshire Moors

It was among 5,000 miles of track closed, but it wasn't long before the line was revived as a thriving tourist attraction, pulling in up to 350,000 visitors a year.

The sight of trains steaming along the 18-mile line will thrill railway enthusiasts, many of whom are expected to flock to the area to celebrate the anniversary in the expected sunshine of the bank holiday weekend.

Visitors will be able to take rides on visiting locomotives between Whitby and Pickering as well as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway's own fleet.

The 75-year-old 60007 Sir Nigel Gresley engine, painted in British Railways blue livery, recently underwent a year of restorative work by the railway's trust, and was back in fine form as it pulled away from Goathland station.

The railway's Green Knight locomotive was also on show alongside a visiting Lancashire Fusilier engine.

The timetable of celebratory journeys begins today until May 12. About 300 volunteers help with the running of the railway alongside 130 paid employees.

The first journeys of the weekend were seen pulling away from Goathland near Scarborough, halfway down the line.

The pictures from the station will provoke memories for many, not just train fans.

It was where the Hogwarts Express arrived for the start of the school year in the Harry Potter films, while Goathland itself was the setting of Aidensfield in Sunday night ITV drama Heartbeat.

The majestic steam trains returned to the line ten years after the railway was closed following the Beeching report in 1963
