The mayor of an Irish town was forced to resign last night after provoking outrage by declaring he would no longer represent Africans from his constituency.

Darren Scully, who is also a councillor for Ireland's centre-right political party Fine Gael, apologised for stating he found ‘black Africans’ to be aggressive and bad-mannered after he caused widespread fury.

However, the former Mayor of Naas faces being jailed or fined for the outburst after an official complaint was made to Republic of Ireland's police force, known as gardaí.

Former mayor: Darren Scully has resigned after provoking outrage by declaring he would no longer represent Africans from his constituency

Politicians and anti-racism groups had demanded Mr Scully’s expulsion, while a Labour MP has reported the father of two’s remarks to gardaí under the Incitement to Hatred Act.

‘I realise now that my remarks were open to an interpretation that I did not intend,’ Mr Scully said in a statement.

‘I abhor racism in all its forms. I have been proud to be mayor of Naas and to represent all the people of the town. However, as a result of the upset that I have caused, I feel it is appropriate that I step down from this position.’

If convicted by gardaí, Mr Scully could face six months to two years in jail or fines ranging from €1,000 to €10,000.

He made the controversial remarks live on the town's Kildare radio station KFM yesterday morning.

Criticising the manner in which black Africans asked for his help in getting on social housing lists, Mr Scully said he would no longer deal with them.

‘I have been met with aggressiveness, I have been met with bad manners,’ he said during the radio interview.

‘I have also been played the race card.

‘[They’ve] said: “Oh yeah you’ll help white people, but you don’t help black people.”’

He added: ‘So after a while of this... I’ve been doing this now for six or seven years – I just made the decision, a conscious decision, earlier this year, that I just was not going to, myself personally, was not going to take on representations from black Africans.

‘I would be very courteous to them and I would pass on their queries to other representatives, who would take their concerns.’

Politicians, equality organisations and minorities support groups all rushed to condemn the comments.

Fine Gael had issued a statement within an hour distancing themselves from his comments and promising that there would be a formal investigation at party level.

‘The views expressed by Cllr Scully do not reflect the views of Fine Gael, and they are not party policy,’ the statement read.

‘Fine Gael is an inclusive party and we are trying to build a country that caters for all.’

Former Labour MP Moosajee Bhamjee warned yesterday that comments such as those by Mr Scully would represent the ‘beginning of official racism’ in Ireland.

The country’s first Muslim MP, who served as a MP for Clare from 1992 to 1997, warned that such comments from a Government party councillor could lead to official State racism if left unchecked.

‘This is really, really frightening because it could be the beginning of State racism in this country,’ Dr Bhamjee said.

‘There is a small neo-Nazi following in this country you know, and this just adds to what they see as enlightenment. It’s important now more than ever that our racism laws be strengthened.’

The psychiatrist said he had been abused in the past himself and he called on the Government to introduce a new paper on racism as the law is clearly deficient in this area.

And even though Mr Scully resigned as mayor last night, Dr Bhamjee believes he should also be expelled from Fine Gael.

‘I’ve been abused myself in the past too, people feel they’re entitled to, but the law of the land says no.

‘Cllr Scully is still a public representative, he should be expelled from Fine Gael after this and I’m calling for that.’

The association campaigning for equality in sport, Show Racism The Red Card, was appalled by the comments and said it was clearly discrimination.

‘The qualification for Mr Scully’s comments that “I am not racist” is bizarre,’ Show Racism the Red Card co-ordinator Garrett Mullan said.

‘There cannot be an acceptance of racism within politics in Ireland.’ 

Sue Conlan, chief executive of the Irish Refugee Council, said: ‘Negative stereotypes create racism, and as we saw earlier this week when a Nigerian taxi driver was assaulted, this can lead to violence.

‘We all have a role to play in counteracting negative stereotypes and our elected officials have a special role to play in promoting tolerance and inclusion throughout the community. Cllr Scully’s comments are outrageous and not worthy of an elected representative.’  

Catherine Murphy, an Independent MP for Mr Scully’s constituency, Kildare North, said the remarks were ‘outrageous’ and ‘totally unacceptable’. She described as ‘unfathomable’ the reasons why he felt the need to make such a statement.

‘While listening to Kildare FM this morning I could scarcely believe what I was hearing.

‘It’s right and proper that Cllr Scully step down as Mayor of Naas immediately and I welcome his decision to do so.

‘However, it’s essential that if he remains as a public representative he must undertake to represent all of the people, without qualification or prejudice.’

Taxi driver Ola Akinsete, who is originally from Nigeria, met Mr Scully last month after he drove him home to Kerdiff Park in Naas.

The 44-year-old, who has lived in Naas since 2000, said: ‘The racial issue in Naas is becoming so bad for the past three years – it’s becoming an epidemic.

But it’s a big shock to me to hear him say those comments as a young man, it’s unbelievable.

‘What’s happening in Naas are discussions about what the black community is doing to the town. For instance, some people say we are taking their jobs and taking over the place. This should not be the attitude of some of the public. We are in a different century.

‘I came to Ireland for a better life but now my wife, Kate, and I just make sure our children are safe and have a better upbringing.

‘If this situation continues, how are my children able to live in a country where they have been brought up with such racial issues?’
