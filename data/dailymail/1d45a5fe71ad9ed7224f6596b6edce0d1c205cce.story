Boris Johnson tried to dodge photographers this morning as he went for a run in what appeared to be last night's shirt.

Asked by photographers how he had initially managed to avoid their long lenses when he left the Midland Hotel in Manchester, the London Mayor declared: 'I'm like a whippet.'

Mr Johnson, who addressed the Tory party conference this morning, left for his 15-minute run around the secure zone just after 6.30am wearing a white shirt, khaki knee-length shorts and trainers.

It begs the question whether the mayor is trying to keep pace with his rival David Cameron who is regularly photographed running before work.

Phew, made it. Boris Johnson returns to his hotel after this morning's run

This weekend the PM was spotted stretching his legs along the banks of a Manchester canal at sunrise.

Mr Johnson's run appeared to pay off as he launched into a barnstorming speech shortly after 10am, speaking of the 'need to put the village back in the city'.

He spoke of how his administration 
had planted 50,000 trees and had identified thousands more growing 
spaces in wasteland around the capital.

He
also spoke of building affordable, decent-sized homes for families with
rooms 'big enough for humans rather than hobbits, as none of us are 
getting any smaller', and expanding his cycle hire scheme.

Speaking of the scheme - dubbed Boris Bikes where cyclists can hire bikes from docking stations around the centre of London - Mr Johnson said: 'There's nothing more
villagey than the sight of someone sailing elegantly past, bolt upright
on one of these big, blue, burly bicycles.'

However, he conceded he he did not know whether to be 'pleased or offended' that not one was stolen during the London riots, saying that only bookshops were safer than his bike stands.

Mr Johnson also contrasted the £140million bike scheme with the problems its French equivalent has encountered.

He said just three bikes were stolen 
during the first two months in London where as in Paris
hundreds were taken. Mr Johnson said he believes this proves there is a growing sense of 'civility and trust' in the capital' and 'respect for property that is public'.

What's on the horizon? Mr Johnson spoke today of the 'need to put the village back in the city' during his speech

Hobbits? Mr Johnson spoke of building affordable, decent-sized homes for families with rooms 'big enough for humans rather than hobbits, as none of us are getting any smaller'

Thumbs up: Mr Johnson said he believes there is a growing sense of 'civility and trust' in the capital' and 'respect for property that is public'

He quipped: 'Does it tell you that the 
people of London are more honest than the light-fingered Parisians? I 
would point out in Paris over a comparable period they managed to lose 
500 bicycles.

'I don't want to violate the "entente 
cordial" but it seems to me there are obvious comparisons to be drawn 
between our population and the light-fingered Parisians.

'What I do think it shows is a growing sense of civility and trust in London, and respect for property that is public.'

Mr Johnson said the 'village' mentality, where people know each others names, was key to fighting crime.

Rival? Mr Cameron stands to applaud Boris Johnson's barnstorming speech this morning. Many believe Mr Johnson harbours hopes of succeeding Mr Cameron

On the economy, Mr Johnson said
that the capital could drive Britain's economic recovery if 
investment in transport continues.

He urged the Government not to scrap spending projects in the city despite the tough financial climate.

He said: 'Thanks to the common sense of this coalition Government, the 
settlement we got last year, we not only have the Tube upgrades, we have
Crossrail and Thameslink, which is going to be as fantastic as 
Crossrail.

'I will not allow that investment and these vital improvements to be jeopardised for a short-term political gain.'

And addressing the prime minister directly, he added: 'I say to my friends in the Treasury - not 
all of whom I see here; well, Dave's here - Franklin D Roosevelt offered
a new deal.

'I give you the wheel deal: you help 
us to invest in transport infrastructure and we in London will supply 
the locomotive of the UK economy.'

Mr Johnson said cutting crime and 
improving transport would attract businesses and called for 'the right 
tax and regulatory framework - I will say no more than that', believing 
'British enterprise will do the rest'.

He told party members: 'I reckon we have a record to be proud of.

'We
have effectively cut the council tax by 10% over the last three years, 
we have put Oyster on the overground, we have delivered a 24-hour 
freedom pass for the people of London - a fact I hardly dare mention in 
Manchester in case they get jealous - (and) the last bendy bus will 
leave our streets by Christmas.

Spotlight: Mr Johnson takes to the stage at the party conference. He told activists he wanted to make sure people who swear at police officers are arrested

'In the new year we will see a generation of Routemaster-style bus with the open platform.'

Mr Johnson, who previously criticised the Government's plans to cut police numbers, said he would not allow the number of officers in the Metropolitan Police to dip below what he deemed 'safe and reasonable'.

In addition, he said he was changing guidance given to the Met to make sure people who swear at officers are arrested.

Activists gave the mayor a standing ovation as he closed his speech saying he had delivered 'sensible, moderate, one-nation Conservative government in London', but there was 'so much more to do'.

He added: 'I have no doubt it is going to be a tough fight, but with your help we can do it again.'

Mr Cameron, who was in the hall for Mr Johnson's address, earlier praised the Mayor, who many believe harbours hopes of succeeding Mr Cameron as Tory leader and Prime Minister.

Mr Cameron told LBC 97.3 Radio today: 'At a time of economic difficulty, I think he brings strong, charismatic leadership, he brings people together, he cheers people up.

'I am right behind him because I think the last thing London needs is a return to Red Ken.'

Mr Livingstone later blasted Mr Johnson's speech, branding him 'out of touch'.

The Labour candidate said: 'Today we saw the real Boris Johnson - an out-of-touch Conservative, failing to put ordinary Londoners first on the issues that really affect them, from rising fares to police cuts.

'He gave no hope to Londoners facing another steep fare rise this January, which will mean bus fares are up 56% under a Tory mayor, and gave no hard commitment on police numbers, which are in fact due to fall by 1,800 according to his own Metropolitan Police figures.

'Under the Conservatives, Londoners are less well-off and increasingly less safe, under a moonlighting mayor who meets bankers more than the police.

'People in London are feeling the squeeze but Boris Johnson doesn't see it.'
