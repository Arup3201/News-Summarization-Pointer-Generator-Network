According to Samir Nasri, Manchester City’s stars will live in fear if they fail to make the grade in the Champions League.

Ahead of the clash with Bayern Munich, the midfielder spoke of new faces coming in at the end of the season as part of a dressing room purge.

‘Let’s be honest, we need to do something or otherwise next year it’s going to be new players,’ he claimed in the hours before they played Pep Guardiola’s team.

Samir Nasri fears Manchester City players could be sold if they crash in Europe again 

Unless City’s players have been specifically warned about their futures by Manuel Pellegrini, history suggests failure in either of their twin targets will not make a blind bit of difference.

Judging by City’s commitment to their current squad of players he can rest easy at night, whatever their results between now and the end of the season.

This is not Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson, where he developed a habit of jettisoning players who were still at the top of their game.

That policy at Old Trafford kept the dressing room on their toes, establishing a relentless drive and hunger for success.

Sergio Aguero was City's saviour again on Tuesday night with a sensational hat-trick 

Nobody was safe and it is part of the reason they won 13 Barclays Premier League titles, five FA Cups and two European Cups during Ferguson’s reign. He liked to keep the dressing room fresh.

At City, where life is good and the money is even better, they have 17 players in the first team squad who are contracted to the club until 2017 at the very least.

Yaya Toure (suspended against Bayern), Bacary Sagna, Matija Nastasic, Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, Willy Caballero, Fernandinho, Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo, on loan at Valencia, have contracts until 2017.

There is a bigger commitment to Stevan Jovetic, Aleksandar Kolarov and Edin Dzeko, who are all tethered to the Barclays Premier League champions until 2018.

Bigger still are the contracts recently signed by five players - Sergio Aguero, captain Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Eliaquim Mangala and Nasri - to keep them at the Etihad until 2019.

In short, they are going nowhere.

Successful contract negotiations are usually good news for supporters. After last season’s success, stability seemed important.

They have a different way of doing things at City and recent history suggests these players will be safe as houses at the end of the season. The big clear-out of star names has never actually occurred.

Since the big money came to the blue half of Manchester, Carlos Tevez (who left for Juventus in 2013), Gareth Barry, Javi Garcia, Kolo Toure and Mario Balotelli have exited the club. None have been missed.

When United were kings of Manchester, they did things a lot differently under Ferguson. Nobody was safe.

Last week, after the former United midfielder Michael Stewart helped Scotland’s press team to a 7-1 victory over England’s media side, he gave a fascinating insight into Fergie’s methods.

Stewart only made a handful of appearances for the club after graduating from Eric Harrison’s academy side, but he witnessed the manager's ruthless streak on many occasions.

For the top players the threat of leaving United was real and that power strengthened the manager’s position within the dressing room. Ferguson ruled the roost.

David Beckham was sold by Ferguson because the boss thought the midfielder was trying to undermine him

The most successful manager in United history occasionally got it wrong and he has apologised countless times for his ‘senior moment’ when he sold Jaap Stam to Lazio in 2002.

In his most recent book - My Autobiography - he makes no apology for allowing some of the biggest players in United’s history to leave at a time when they believed they were at the top of their game.

There are countless examples. Despite the success of the title-winning teams in the Nineties he sold Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, Andrei Kanchelskis, Lee Sharpe and Gary Pallister at various times.

In 2003 he sold David Beckham to Real Madrid for £25million all in after claiming that the midfielder had deliberately attempted to undermine him in front of the supporters.

Juan Sebastian Veron was moved on because Ferguson ‘couldn’t find a position for him’ and Ruud van Nistelrooy was sold to Real Madrid: ‘He became a really difficult boy. I don’t think he was popular by the end’.

Mark Bosnich, who had issues with his weight according to Ferguson, was sold to Chelsea after calling to order a Chinese takeaway in front of the United manager.

Owen Hargreaves, signed from Bayern Munich in 2007, was ‘a disaster’.

And there was no room for sentimentality - captains and iconic figures Bryan Robson and Steve Bruce were moved on in the mid-Nineties.

Ferguson liked to keep that dressing room living in fear of change, to remind players that United always had a replacement in mind.

City have been busy accumulating players, some very good ones at that, but they operate under a different set of criteria at the Etihad.

They have kept all their big names sweet by tying them to lucrative, long-term contracts as part of a strategy to keep the club at the top of English football.

Beyond the money, they need to find a different way to motivate them.
