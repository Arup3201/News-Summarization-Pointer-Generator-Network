Two Polish siblings tortured their elderly mother to death during an exorcism which they believed would rid her of ‘the devil’, when in fact the 75-year-old had Alzheimer’s.

Piotr Majewski, 38, and Barbara Majewski, 39, from Ostrowiec, in south-central Poland, claimed they thought their 75-year-old mother was possessed by demons.

The brother and sister carried out a violent ritual on their mother Irena which left her with broken ribs, a shattered jaw and severe brain trauma.

The Majewski siblings tied their mother to a bed and carried out religious rituals, before proceeding to beating and torturing her to rid her of ‘the devil’. In fact, the 75-year-old suffered from Alzheimer’s.

The brother and sister are now facing 12 years in jail for the murder of their mother.

The Majewskis later told police the spirit of their late father was the channel between Irena and the devil, who wanted her soul.

‘They said at first they tried to banish his spirit from the house, and when that failed went ahead with the full blown exorcism,’ said a police spokesman.

‘They tied her to a bed, put a cross on her head and forced her to drink holy water and renounce the devil.

‘When she told them she had had no contact with either Satan or her dead husband, they began beating and torturing her,’ said local prosecutor Miroslaw Cebula said.

The popular belief is that demons are cowards, and cannot stand pain, which will see them fleeing a human host.

An autopsy showed that Irena Majewski died from broken ribs, a shattered jaw and severe brain trauma.

Exorcism is one of three types of sacramentals listed by the Catholic Church, alongside blessings and consecrations/dedications.

Guidelines issued in 1999 by the Vatican states that Catholic exorcisms can only be carried out on a person claiming to be possessed by demons or the devil after an evaluations by a doctor ton rule out a mental of physical illness.
