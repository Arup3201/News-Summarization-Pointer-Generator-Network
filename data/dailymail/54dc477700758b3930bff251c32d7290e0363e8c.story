Moto 3 riders Bryan Schouten and Scott Deroue came to blows after the pair crashed out of the German Grand Prix.

The Dutch pair collided during lap 26 at the Sachsenring in Saxony.

RW Racing GP rider Schouten was so furious at Deroue's involvement in the incident that he strode over to his compatriot before unleashing an attempted right hook to his head.

The fired up Dutchmen had to be separated by race medics as their brawl continued in the gravel traps - with Schouten even lashing out at Deroue further with a kick.

For all their efforts though, it's needless to say that minimal damage would have been caused to either rider as they both fought with their helmets and protective racing gear on.

In an incident-packed Grand Prix, Australian Jack Miller won race nine of the 18-track championship ahead of Brad Binder and Alexis Masbou.
