Roughly 60 emaciated dogs in in Alabama thought to be made to fight with hogs as part of a sick gambling game were rescued on Monday from a residence.

The Cottonwood Police Department got a search warrant for the property where they found the severely abused dogs requiring immediate rescue and where they also discovered illegal drugs and firearms.

The Humane Society told AL.com that the digs range in age from four months old to teenagers

Saved: Approximately 60 dogs were rescued from a suspected hog dog breeding operation in Cottonwood, Alabama on Monday 

Emaciated: The dogs range in age from 4 months to teens, and this one was a French bull dog 

Horrible conditions: Dogo argentino puppies wait to be rescued from the Cottonwood residence 

'The cruelty these dogs were shown is painful to see, and we couldn't stand by and allow them to suffer,' said Col. Jim Smith, public safety director for the town of Cottonwood said.

Of the dogs most of them were of the breed Dogo Argentino - Argentine board-fighting dogs - but two of them were French bull dogs and one was a German Shepard.

The Humane Society believes that the dogs were trained to bite the faces of hogs as spectators placed their bets to see which dog could complete the vicious task first.

Animal cruelty and felony drug related charges are pending.

Veterinarians were on scene to evaluate the dogs and provide any immediate medical attention needed.

The rescued dogs will be held at a temporary shelter where they will receive veterinary care and enrichment.

These dogs are lucky that the authorities responded quickly to this situation,' said Chris Schindler, manager of animal fighting investigations for The HSUS. 

'With the recent cold temperatures and the dogs' poor condition, they needed immediate attention. We are glad to have been called in to assist in this case, and we will continue to be part of the investigation and prosecution process.'
