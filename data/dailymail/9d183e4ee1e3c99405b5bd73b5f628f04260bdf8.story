Former Republican Gov. and populist Mike Huckabee  won the Iowa caucuses in 2008 before quitting the presidential race.

He skipped the 2012 contest entirely - 'All the factors say go, but my hearts say no' was how he described his decision back then.

And now, with 2016 in the distance, might he make another go of it?

Here's what he told Fox News Sunday when asked whether he's open to the possibility of running: 'The honest answer is yes.'

Former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Sunday there's about a 50-50 chance he'll run for president again in 2016 and that he will make a final decision after next year's midterm elections

'It would be, frankly, dishonest to say no,' Huckabee said.

He says the party has 'a strong stable' of potential candidates and he'll make a decision after the 2014 election.

And how does he give the odds now?

'Maybe at this point it is 50-50,' he said.

And we've heard this before - 'It would be a decision of the heart.'

Addressing other issues, Huckabee suggested that Americans tend to show less regard for a single, working mother than a member of the ruling class.

He also defended his recent statement that Washington and Wall Street is the 'axis of evil', suggesting the connection between power and money doesn’t regard the needs of middle-class Americans.

Americans have indeed embraced populist Democratic candidates over the past several months, including New York Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, whose campaign focusing on perceived income inequality resonated with New York residents.

However, Huckabee made clear, 'I don’t want big government to determine what income equality looks like'.

Huckabee decided in 2011 not to enter the most recent presidential election campaign, saying: “All of the factors say go, but my heart says no.”

Huckabee also said his final decision to run for presdient would still come from the heart.
