Jerry Springer producer Jill Blackstone was in tears as she returned to the San Fernando Valley home where her sister died for the first time on Thursday.

The TV producer hid behind sunglasses and a baseball cap as a friend drove her to the house she had shared with her sister, whose death by asphyxiation is being treated as a murder by police.

The 52-year-old was visibly shaken as she approached the home, and she could be seen wiping her eyes after undergoing a particularly traumatic week.

Jill had initially been charged with Wendy’s murder, but the Los Angeles District Attorney dropped the charges and she was released on Wednesday afternoon.

Painful: Hollywood producer Jill Blackstone was in tears as she returned to the San Fernando Valley home on where her sister was murdered for the first time on Thursday evening

Visibly shaken, producer Blackstone  was arrested last Saturday on suspicion of murder of her sister, returned to the San Fernando Valley home the two of them shared for the first time last night

Blackstone was an animal activist. There were three dogs found dead in the garage with her sister Wendy

However, many questions remain over her partially blind and deaf sister’s death. Wendy was found on Saturday in the home’s garage, apparently asphyxiated by carbon monoxide gas.

Also found at the scene was a handwritten suicide note, which police determined had been written by Jill, and the bodies of their three dogs.

According to TMZ, Jill had woken up in her bed and called neighbors who, in turn, called 911.

She was treated in hospital for effects of gas inhalation for two days before being discharged, at which time she was arrested.

Earlier, a police spokesperson emphasized Wendy’s death is still being treated as a murder.

LAPD officer Drake Madison told Daily Mail Online this is 'an ongoing murder investigation'.

'Jill Blackstone was arrested on Saturday but the District Attorney dropped the charges and she is no longer in custody. The investigation is still active and the police are looking for a murderer,' he added.

Asked if the police could re-arrest Jill, officer Madison said he had no further information to give at this time.

Neighbors have speculated the sisters – who ran the Thumping Tails Animal Rescue Center together out of their home – had entered into a suicide pact.

Police say the murder investigation is ongoing. It is possible that Jill could be re-arrested

Stephanie Cohen, 60, who lives across the street from the sisters said: ‘The police were here for 12 to 14 hours on Saturday. We were told they were investigating a double suicide, an attempt, and one of the people died.’

Numerous signs are posted on the property saying it is marked for demolition.

Stephanie added: ‘They were having a hard time finding a new home because the sister that died was very ill - she couldn’t see, she couldn’t hear, she was housebound, she was very ill. So she needed to find a house that could accommodate her sister with the illness and the dogs. Evidently the pressure was intense on them, but nobody expected this to happen.’

As a producer, Jill has worked on shows including Jerry Springer, Sally Jessy Raphael, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, Dr. Drew On Call, The Real, and The Osbournes.

On her Linkedin page she describes herself as: 'Some of you know me as a TV producer, others as an animal welfare advocate and dog rescuer. I'm all those things.’
