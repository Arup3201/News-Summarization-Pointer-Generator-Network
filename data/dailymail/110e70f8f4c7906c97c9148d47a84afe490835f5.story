Luis Suarez has left the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne following a five-hour hearing on the first day of his appeal case against his four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

Suarez refused to answer questions as he left the CAS headquarters in the Swiss city but did stop to sign autographs for waiting fans.  

The Barcelona striker and his legal team are confident the ban from 'all football-related activity', handed down by world governing body FIFA, will be halved.

This would open the way for Uruguay star Suarez, 27, to return after August 25, potentially making his debut for the La Liga club at Villarreal on August 31.

Judgement day: Luis Suarez arrives at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland for his appeal hearing against the four-month ban handed down by FIFA for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup

Confident: Suarez's legal team are optimistic his four-month ban will be halved, making his available to play for new club Barcelona at the end of August

His legal team will argue that the ban should be restricted to international football and that he should be allowed to train with Barcelona while he is suspended. 

Following the hearing, CAS issued a statement which read: 'The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has today heard the appeal of Luis Suarez, FC Barcelona and the Uruguayan FA against FIFA. The hearing took place at the CAS headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.

'The player was present and gave a statement to the Panel of CAS arbitrators: Mr Bernhard Welten, Switzerland (President), Professor Luigi Fumagalli, Italy, and Dr Marco Balmelli, Switzerland.

'At the end of the hearing, the panel informed the parties that it will issue its decision as soon as possible, probably before the end of next week.

'The full arbitral award, with the grounds, will follow at a later date and be published by the CAS.' 

FIFA imposed the four-month ban from all football, plus a nine-month international ban and a £66,000 fine, after the former Liverpool player bit Chiellini on the shoulder during Uruguay's 1-0 win on June 24.

The governing body's appeal committee have already turned down an appeal against the suspension.

What he did

Suarez bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder while waiting for a cross during Uruguay's World Cup match on June 24. Replays showed Suarez lunged at Chiellini and bit him before falling to the ground clutching his face. The Italian later pulled down his shirt to reveal bite marks.

The punishment

On June 26, FIFA's Disciplinary Committee handed down a four-month ban from all football-related activity as well as a nine-match international suspension and a fine of £66,000.

What are the implications of this?

The four-month ban means Suarez is unable to play again until October 25. After the World Cup, Liverpool sold him to Barcelona for a fee of £75m. Intriguingly, if the ban is upheld, Suarez's first match after the ban will be the Clasico with Real Madrid on October 26.

What if the appeal succeeds?

His legal team believe there is a chance the ban could be halved to just two months, therefore expiring on August 25 instead. Barcelona's first match after that date is at Villarreal on August 31.

But FIFPro, the world players' union, supports a reduction in Suarez's punishment at domestic and international level.

A statement on the organisation's website read: 'That Luis Suarez has been trialled and vilified in public, ever since the incident, is a sanction in itself.

'On the other hand, it has been remarkable to see the response from his fellow professionals and the victim himself, Giorgio Chiellini.

'Many agree the sanctions are excessive. This is an important signal for the CAS panel to consider.

'The sanctions are a disproportionate response to the offence.

'Especially the four-month ban from all football-related activity, which is unfair for Suarez as it infringes his right to work at club level.

'In the international arena, where the offence was committed, a nine-match ban for Uruguay is also too strong as it effectively equates to a two-year sanction.

Bearing his teeth: Suarez later apologised to Chiellini and the 'entire football family' and promised that there would never again be another incident

'FIFPro states the educative nature of the sanction mentioned by FIFA in the ruling can be much better achieved by making it partially conditional, including the obligation for Luis Suarez to receive treatment.

'This can be applied on the number of matches but also on the period of the ban. The FIFA appeals committee missed an opportunity to take this into account. FIFPro expects that CAS will respect these assumptions.'

Suarez's lawyer Alejandro Balbi, a member of the Uruguayan FA's executive, admitted there was little chance of overturning the nine-match international ban, but there was a likelihood of getting the four-month overall ban reduced.

Balbi told Uruguyan newspaper El Observador: 'It would be more logical to reduce the sanction by a few months than to reduce the ban concerning international games, because legally it's easier to contend against the terms of the suspension that forbid him from training and from being at the club, because they violate fundamental rights.

'The other ban (the nine-match ban for Uruguay) is more a question of the level of the punishment.'

Liverpool sold Suarez, who scored 31 goals last season, to Barcelona for £75m after his FIFA ban. 

The Court of Arbitration for Sport, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, is regarded as the 'Supreme Court' for the sporting world.

Since its establishment by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1984, it has resolved thousands of disputes that were unable to be settled by the sport's own governing body.

The CAS has often been used to settle doping cases but also sponsorship disputes and even the result of competitions.
