Pat Boone, the Fifties' crooner, has been filmed saying he believes that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and not the U.S.

Announcing his 'birther' opinions, Boone said the President's long-form birth certificate, which was finally released in April, was a 'photoshopped fraud'.

Boone, 77, who is a member of the Beverly Hills Tea Party,  also alleged that the President was 'spending millions of dollars' of taxpayers' money to cover up 'the truth'.

Taped: Speaking on video, Pat Boone, left, said he did not believe that 
President Obama, pictured right speaking in New York last night, was 
born in the U.S.

Speaking on video to the San Francisco Chronicle, Boone said: 'I was in Kenya about a year and a half ago and everybody said, 'you know he was born here.'…Why else would he be hiding all his records.

'He is spending millions of dollars so we do not have his records.

'And experts have already looked at and been able to verify that this long-form document is a fraud.

'But the media ignores it… a total fraud. A photoshopped fraud.'

According to a recent CNN poll, one in six Americans still believes the President was definitely or probably not born in the U.S.

However this figure of 17 per cent - after the release of the birth certificate in April - was a fall from the 25 per cent who gave the same response in the previous month.

The birth certificate shows that the President was born in Hawaii.

The comments from Boone, a music legend who is one of Billboard's top ten recording artists of all time, come after a book published on the topic reached number six on a New York Times best seller list.

‘Where's the Birth Certificate?’ by Jerome Corsi, which argues that Mr Obama  is not a natural-born U.S. citizen, stormed the charts after it was released in June.

The book's blurb says it shows 
‘conclusively that no legal authority has ever verified Obama's legal 
eligibility to be President’.

It has a ‘compelling body of evidence’ 
to show that Mr Obama ‘is not a natural-born citizen as is required of 
all presidents (by) the Constitution’.

Dr Corsi says his work shows Mr Obama 
was a dual citizen of the UK and U.S. - and shows he was registered in 
school as a Muslim and Indonesian citizen.
