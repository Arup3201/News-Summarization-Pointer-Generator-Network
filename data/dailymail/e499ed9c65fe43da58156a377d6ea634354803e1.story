Producers of a long-running stage musical have axed its Cliff Richard tribute segment in the wake of sex abuse allegations  against the star.

The impersonator who portrays Sir Cliff, Trevor Payne, 68, who is also the show's director, has found himself out of a job because producers fear the star's fanatical fans would 'lynch' any audience member who complained about the section if it remained in the show.

The popular rock n' roll show That'll Be The Day has featured a tribute act to Sir Cliff since it began its first run 29 years ago.

Last month Sir Cliff Richard furiously denied sexually assaulting a schoolboy at a Christian rally.

His denial came as police raided his home over the allegation dating back almost three decades.

The star said 'completely false' claims had been circulating on the internet for months but he had chosen not to 'dignify' them with a response.

Detectives swooped on the singer's £3.1million apartment in Berkshire on August 13, spending five hours searching for evidence after receiving a report that a teenager under the age of 16 was attacked in Sheffield at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham in 1985.

Now, producers of the musical have decided to remove the six minute segment in the wake of the historical sex abuse allegations.

They say they are worried that if they kept it in and a member of the audience publicly complained, Sir Cliff's fanatical followers would round on them and cause a public order outbreak. 

As a result Mr Payne has been 'inundated' with complaints from Cliff fans and was even accosted at the stage door of the Eastbourne Congress Theatre by an 'indignant' secretary of one Cliff Richard fan club.

Mr Payne, 68, said he is 'very saddened' that the popular section has been axed.

He said: 'Cliff's fans are vehemently addicted and defensive of him and have been for many many years.

'We, like everyone else, were shocked when the allegations came to light and we hope that he is cleared of them. 

 'But we took the view that if I did venture on stage as Sir Cliff and just one member of the audience booed or made a remark then it wouldn't be a situation we could contain.

'We do get a lot of Cliff Richard fans attend our shows and they would probably turn on the person and we could have a terrible situation inside the theatre that would ruin the night.

'Put it this way, I asked one passionate Cliff fan how she would react if it happened and she replied "I'd have their guts for garters".

'We also took the view that because Sir Cliff himself has cancelled all his public engagements until further notice we would follow suit.

'We aren't judging him or condemning him. We all hope he is innocent.

'I have received lots of emails of complaint from our fans. One person sent me an email saying they had booked to see the show in Stevenege in October but they would not be coming since we took Cliff out of it.

'One lady, the secretary of a Cliff fan club, came to see me at the stage door in Eastbourne and was most indignant about it.'

Mr Payne appeared as Cliff Richard in the music video for comedian Peter Kay's famous version of Amarillo in 2005 and his Channel 4 comedy show Max and Paddy's Road to Nowehere. 

"When the news broke we decided to remove the section.

'It is very sad. I am a big fan of Cliff Richard and have met him and he is a charming man.' 

Sir Cliff reacted with fury  after learning that police searched his apartment in Sunningdale - while the BBC filmed live - when he had no prior notice.

He was on holiday in Portugal at the time and returned to the UK ahead of his meeting with police. 

On August 23 the veteran star voluntarily met officers from South Yorkshire Police but was not arrested or charged, said his spokesman.
