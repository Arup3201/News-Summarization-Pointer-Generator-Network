Manchester United midfielder Angel di Maria has revealed that a chat with former Old Trafford hero Cristiano Ronaldo played a big part in his decision to join the Premier League club last summer.

The 26-year-old played alongside the Portuguese at Real Madrid for four years before linking up with Louis van Gaal in a £60million deal in August.

And Di Maria, who will face Ronaldo when Argentina take on Portugal in a friendly on Tuesday night, has admitted that the Ballon d'Or holder had nothing but good things to say about the Red Devils.

In an interview with Inside United magazine, Di Maria said: 'Before we knew I was coming to Manchester for sure, he (Ronaldo) told me it was a massive club and that I would be very happy here and it would be good for me.

'At that time, we didn't know for sure that I was coming or not, so we didn't go into great detail, but what he did say helped me greatly to make my decision.'

Di Maria will go head-to-head with his former team-mate when Ronaldo makes an emotional return to Old Trafford for Tuesday's evening's game, but the Argentine star insists he has no regrets about leaving La Liga and Carlo Ancelotti's side.

He added: 'It was a very big moment in my career. Leaving a club like Real and coming to as big a club as Manchester United makes you grow as a player and helps you progress in your career.

'It was a very important moment and I'm really happy here. Let's hope things go well for me so I can be here for many years.'

Di Maria will return to club action when United visit the Emirates on Sunday for a Premier League clash with Arsenal.
