The former husband of lingerie supremo, Michelle Mone, has set up a rival underwear firm in partnership with the designer at the centre of the couple's split.

Samantha Bunn, 32, will hold a similar role at the new company, Pendulum Apparel, to the one she had at Ultimo,

The news of the new company comes in the wake of Ms Mone's successful purchase of the Ultimo shares owned by her ex partner.

Michael Mone, 45, held 48 per cent of the shares in the underwear giant, which is valued at £50 million.

The launch of Pendulum apparel is the latest salvo fired in the ongoing battle between the former Mr and Mrs Mone.

According to The Sun, a source said: 'This is a slap in the face for Michelle. Michael is really experienced 
and Samantha is one of the hottest designers. It seems like a dream 
combination.'

The couple divorced in January after Michelle accused Michael of having an affair with Miss Bunn, a successful lingerie designer who made her name working for Ultimo.

Bunn was sacked by Mrs Mone over her alleged relationship with Michael but received a £10,000 pay off after threatening legal action.

Mr Mone denied cheating, saying: 'Prior to our split, there was no relationship. If anyone is saying that is the reason for the split, that is untrue.'

Ultimo was founded by Michelle and Michael Mone in 1996 and the company's first bra went on sale three years later.

The design sold out instantly, and 14 years on, Ultimo is one of the biggest lingerie companies in the UK.

A string of famous faces have fronted the brand's campaigns, beginning with Rod Stewart's statuesque wife, Penny Lancaster.

Stewart's former wife, Rachel Hunter, and daughter Kimberley have also appeared in Ultimo campaigns, as has Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding.

The current face of Ultimo is  Argentine actress and model, Luisana Lopilato, who has held the role since 2011.
