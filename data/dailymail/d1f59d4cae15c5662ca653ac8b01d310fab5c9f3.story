A mother has been accused of drinking alcohol before losing control of her van, plunging it into a 30ft-deep reservoir and killing two five-year-old girls, including her daughter.

Arlene Hernandez, 22, wept in Chula Vista Superior Court, California on Wednesday as she pleaded not guilty to DUI manslaughter, child abuse and drunken driving causing injury.

Hernandez and a male passenger were able to escape the sinking vehicle but her daughter, Lesette Silva, and five-year-old Guiliana Figueroa could not free themselves and later died in hospital.

According to the California Highway 
Patrol, Hernandez was under the influence of alcohol when 
she lost control of her car on Sunday, at 6.15pm.

Deputy District Attorney Mary Loeb said investigators are waiting for the results of Hernandez's blood-alcohol test taken after the crash.

They added that the relationship between Hernandez and Figueroa was not clear, but it is believed they were taking their daughters for a play date.

Hernandez cried throughout her brief court hearing on Wednesday.

'Ms. Hernandez is very distraught about 
what happened,' her attorney, Jonathan Jordan, said afterwards.

'At this point it is very traumatic 
experience, not only for her but a lot of other people involved. Allow 
them to grieve and mourn their children, then we’ll see how this 
case is going to shake out.'

She faces up to 13 years in prison if found guilty. The judge ordered to keep her bail at $400,000.

Guiliana's mother, Natasa Sierra, also attended the hearing but stayed silent.

Guiliana,
who used the nickname 'Juju', had just finished preschool, while 
Lesette had just started first grade at Parkview Elementary School in 
Chula Vista.

A candlelight vigil was held for Guiliana Tuesday night, and her father was able to attend.

'I know Juju is looking from above and 
she appreciates each and everyone of you that has touched her life,' he mother said. 'She 
had a lot of love to give and still had a lot more.'

Friends said the family is not judging Hernandez and offered their family sincere condolences.

'We don’t want to get into the position where we have that hate. For us, it’s more of a remembrance of Juju and we want to keep it that way,' family friend Gabriel Lucero.said.

The crash happened close to the 150-acre US Olympic Training Centre, in Chula Vista, which is used by around 4,000 athletes each year competing in archery, cycling, field hockey and track and field.

The lake itself is used by athletes to train for rowing,  canoeing and kayaking.
