Convicted: Former mayor John Larsen, who had an 'active interest in pyrotechnics' has been jailed for 18 years after he was found guilty of setting off dangerous explosions

Fear gripped a sleepy market town when a mystery bomber embarked on a campaign of terror, setting off explosions wrecking cars, breaking windows and damaging homes.

As a former mayor, Liberal Democrat councillor and a prominent member of the Neighbourhood Watch group, John Larsen was at the forefront of those condemning the attacks.

Yesterday, however, the shame of the unlikeliest suspect for the terror in Denbigh, north Wales, was complete.

Unmasked as the man behind the campaign, he has now been jailed for 18 years.

Larsen, 46, a married father-of-one was found guilty of three counts of arson, one charge of causing an explosion and a further count of possessing explosive substances.

The former stonemason had denied the charges, claiming he was making fireworks for magic shows he performed for family and friends.

But the jury of six men and six women, sitting at Caernarfon Crown Court, took around six hours to dismiss his version of events.

Judge Merfyn Hughes QC told Larsen: ‘For some months you subjected the residents of Denbigh to a sustained campaign of quite deliberate terror. While you were detonating these explosive devices you continued the pretence of showing concern for their welfare.

‘I am entirely satisfied had you not been arrested you would have killed or caused someone very serious injury. You abused the trust placed in you as a councillor.’

Explosives: The trial heard that Larsen made his own Improvised Explosive Device which he used to blow up a car near his home in Denbigh, Wales

Blast: Damage caused to a nearby car by one of Larsen's explosions

Force: Shrapnel from the main explosion shattered the glass of a nearby porchway

Wyn Lloyd Jones, prosecuting, told 
the court that Larsen got a ‘thrill’ out of setting off the explosions, 
which began in February this year and culminated in a large bomb, which 
Larsen detonated underneath a neighbour’s 4x4 in the Lenton pool area of
the town on March 24.

The
barrister told the court it was ‘extremely fortunate’ no-one had been 
injured by Larsen’s home-made Improvised Explosive Device (IED), which 
was packed with ball bearings and sent metal shrapnel flying up to 90ft 
away, smashing windows of nearby properties and damaging cars.

At
the time, train driver Mark Jones, 44, and his partner Shirley Clarke, 
47, spoke of their terror after the headboard of their bed was left 
studded with ball bearings.

‘It was horrendous, so frightening. We saw a flash and then heard a boom sound which shook the house,’ said Mrs Clarke, a nurse.

The couple were so terrified they have since sold their home.

Explosive: A number of improvised explosive devices were discovered at Larsen's home. He claimed he had been making fireworks, not bombs

Danger: One of Larsen's home-made improvised explosive devices

Bomb kit: Searches of the defendant¿s home found a book about 'the chemistry of pyrotechnics', a bag of 50 ball bearings, various powders and chemicals, a pestle and mortar, flares, modified fireworks and rockets and four other similar IEDs

Haul: Fuse wire and component parts found at Larsen's home. The court heard he had also been reporting his 'concerns' about explosions to the police to 'put them off the scent'

The
court heard that Larsen, who has an 11-year-old daughter, was working 
as a town councillor until his arrest and was mayor of Denbigh in 1999.

He
pretended to be a ‘responsible citizen,’ by speaking to his local paper
to denounce the bomber and also reported his concerns to police.

Larsen,
who was unemployed at the time, even spoke at a residents’ meeting 
blaming ‘yobs’ for the attacks. He was eventually caught when Denbigh 
resident Caroline Williams spotted Larsen ‘bending down’ by a Land Rover
Discovery parked near his home shortly before the main explosion on 
March 24 and reported him to officers.

Following his arrest police found files on his home computer containing research notes about how to make explosives.

Police
also found a book about ‘the chemistry of pyrotechnics’, a bag of 50 
ball bearings, various powders and chemicals, a pestle and mortar, 
flares, fireworks and rockets and similar IEDs.

Shrapnel: In the largest of the explosions, an IED filled with ball bearings was detonated, causing damage to nearby homes and cars

Investigation: X-Ray images taken of the IEDs made by Larsen revealed they were filled with ball bearings
