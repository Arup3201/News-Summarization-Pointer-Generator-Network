Three British Muslims were accused yesterday of plotting a suicide bomb attack designed to wreak more devastation than the July 7 attacks.

The Al Qaeda-inspired trio masterminded a conspiracy to detonate eight home-made rucksack devices, a court was told.

They bragged how the attacks would have caused ‘mass deaths’ in crowded areas. One of the men was secretly recorded saying the 2005 London attacks had ‘gone a bit wrong’ because the killers forgot to put nails in their bombs.

They also discussed mass poisoning and fixing blades to the wheels of a vehicle before driving it into a crowd of people, and boasted their plot would be ‘another 9/11’.

The trio raised thousands of pounds to fund the plot by posing as street collectors for the humanitarian charity Muslim Aid, the jury was told. Two of the men are alleged to have travelled to Pakistan to attend a terrorist camp and received training with explosives, weapons and poisons. They are said to have recorded ‘martyrdom videos’ explaining their actions which were to be released to the media after their deaths.

On their return to Birmingham, they set up a bomb factory in a council flat and began recruiting a team of accomplices.

The jihadist plot was smashed by counter-terrorism police and MI5, who had the cell under intensive surveillance, bugging the men’s cars and the bomb factory.

Eleven men and one woman were arrested when officers swooped on addresses across Birmingham in September last year.

Opening the case amid high security at Woolwich Crown Court, prosecutor Brian Altman QC said those on trial were ‘senior members of a home-grown terror cell’.

The trio were arrested by police after covert probes caught them talking about their plot as they were heating chemicals in Ali's home

He said: ‘The police successfully disrupted a plan to commit an act or acts of terrorism on a scale potentially greater than the London bombings in July 2005. The defendants were proposing to detonate up to eight rucksack bombs in a suicide attack and/or to detonate bombs on timers in crowded areas in order to cause mass deaths and casualties.

‘One of them was even to describe their plan as “another 9/11”.’

Two of the men – unemployed graduate Irfan Naseer, 31, and former security guard Irfan Khalid, 27 – are accused of twice travelling to terrorist camps in Pakistan. They spent 15 months learning how to make bombs, use weapons and create poisons ‘for the sole purpose’ of bringing their knowledge to Britain and using it, the court heard.

When they returned in July 2011, they teamed up with Ashik Ali, 27, whose ground-floor flat was transformed into a safe house to experiment with explosive chemicals. The court heard Naseer was recorded agreeing with another man that July 7 had ‘gone a bit wrong’ because the bombers did not use nails.

Naseer, a heavily-built man known as ‘Chubbs’, used knowledge from his pharmacy degree to mix the chemicals. He bought an instant cold pack, in the mistaken belief it contained ammonium nitrate.

The men were recorded talking about training with AK-47 assault rifles and grenades as well as firing a rocket launcher and the vehicle blade plot, which was in the Al Qaeda magazine, Inspire.

Partially-sighted Ali, a former charity manager, obtained the flat with the help of a blind charity.

Woolwich Crown Court heard how the gang tried to raise further funds by gambling the cash they raised from their bogus charity collections through a currency trading company

But he was recorded telling his estranged wife he was going abroad to fight jihad, and comparing himself and others to Four Lions, a film about bungling British extremists. After he was arrested, Ali confessed that his role was to wear a suicide vest and carry a gun, but he denied he would have carried out the attack, it was alleged. The terrorist cell was allegedly inspired by internet videos and the writings of Osama Bin Laden and US-born Yemeni extremist Anwar Al-Awlaki, who was killed in a drone strike 12 days after the suspects were arrested.

The men raised £14,500 by impersonating street collectors for a charity and an Islamic learning centre, the jury heard. But Rahin Ahmed, 26, a conspirator who has admitted terrorist offences, lost £9,000 gambling on the currency markets. The court heard the law graduate was the gang’s ‘chief financier’ but was ostracised after his trading spree.

The men wanted to spend the money on setting up a high-street Islamic centre which would serve as a front for terrorist recruitment.

All three are also accused of radicalising and recruiting other young Muslim men to their extremist cause. All of those allegedly involved in the plot are of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin and from the Sparkhill, Sparkbrook, Balsall Heath and Alum Rock areas of Birmingham.

The jury was told about others linked to the plot, including several men who have admitted involvement and are awaiting sentence.

They included Ahmed and Mujahid Hussain, 21, who pleaded guilty to helping collect money for terrorism. Four men – Ishaaq Hussain, 20, Naweed Ali, 24, Khobaib Hussain, 20, and Shahid Khan, 20 – have admitted flying to Pakistan for terrorist training in August 2011. But they returned before joining the camp after one of their families learned of their plans.

Two others – Ashik Ali’s brother Bahader, 29, and Mohammed Rizwan, 33 – will go on trial next year accused of terrorist offences. Ali’s estranged wife, Salma Kabal, 23, will also go on trial next year, accused of failing to inform the authorities of her knowledge of the plot.

Naseer, Khalid and Ali deny preparing terrorist acts, including plotting a bomb attack, recruiting others and sending people aboard for training. The trial, which is expected to last three months, continues.
