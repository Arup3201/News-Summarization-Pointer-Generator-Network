This is the moment an on-site school resource officer in Arizona used a stun gun to break up  two high school students who had begun fighting in the cafeteria during lunch. 

The altercation at Mountain Ridge High School broke out after a 17-year-old attacker came behind a 16-year-old student who was about to sit down to eat and pulled him to the ground, police said.

'Get off of him, get off of him', the officer can be heard screaming repeatedly as the two students continue to fight.

Unable to break up the dispute, the officer then points her stun gun at the leg of the student who initiated the attack.

The tasered student stays on the ground and starts to crawls away before getting up and trying to walk before the officer stops him and makes him lay on the ground face-down while she handcuffs him behind his back.

School officials can be seen pushing away people who try to come to the teenager's aid.

'During lunch, the School Resource Officer (SRO) and campus security repeatedly attempted to redirect a student demonstrating aggressive behavior toward another student.

'Despite the efforts of the SRO to deescalate the situation, the student attacked the other student. After multiple warnings from the SRO, identifying herself as a police officer and stating she would use her stun gun if he did not stop, the student persisted in injuring the other student.

'The SRO pulled her stun gun and fired once, striking the student in the upper leg. No other students were involved.'
