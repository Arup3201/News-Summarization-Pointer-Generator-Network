Google is set to announce a second-generation Nexus tablet at an event next week with a higher resolution 7-inch screen and a 5MP rear-facing camera. 

Specifications and price details have been leaked ahead of the announcement that claim the device will sell for £150 ($229) for a 16GB model and £175 ($269) for the 32GB version.

The device could also be the first to run Google's next operating system Android 4.3, which the company is also expected to launch on 24 July.

Google is set to announce an updated Nexus tablet at an event next week with a higher resolution 7-inch screen and 5MP camera. Images, pictured, and details have been leaked by technology site Android Central ahead of the announcement that claim the device will sell for around £150

It has been a year since Google launched its bargain tablet built by Asus, which was praised for its high-quality specifications and its low price of £159.

Other 7-inch tablets including the iPad Mini cost around the £250 mark.

Rumours about an updated model surfaced last month when a customer service representative from Asus - the company that makes the tablets for Google - apparently leaked the full specifications.

Google then sent invitations to a press event scheduled for 24 July earlier this week.

Android Central has since posted a video and pictures of what it expects is the next Nexus model.

Screen: 7-inch

Resolution: 1280 x 800

Camera: 1.2 MP front-facing camera

Operating system: Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean)

Processor: NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor

Memory: 1GB RAM

Battery:  4,325 mAh battery

Storage: 16GB and 32GB

Price: £159 (16GB), £199 (32GB)

Screen: 7-inch

Resolution: 1980 x 1200

Camera: 1.2 MP front-facing, 5MP rear-facing

Operating system: Android 4.3

Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor

Memory: 2GB RAM

Battery:  4,325 mAh battery

Storage: 16GB and 32GB

Price: £150 (16GB), £175 (32GB)   

The images look very similar to the current tablet - they show an all-black design with the Asus and Nexus branding and the buttons in the same place as on the original tablet.

The texture on the back of the device appears to have been removed.

Specifications leaked by the Asus representative claimed the tablet will have a 5MP rear-facing camera, for the first time, as well as 1.2MP front-facing camera.

Google was criticised following the launch of its first Nexus 7 for not including a rear-facing camera.

At the time a spokesman was quoted as saying the company left the feature off because it didn't want to encourage people to use the device as a camera because it was too big.

Analysts claimed Google and Asus might have excluded the device to keep costs down.

The first Google Nexus 7 tablet by Asus was launched in June 2012. It was praised for its high-quality specifications and low price

The second-generation Nexus 7 is likely to have a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, as seen in Google's Nexus 4 handset, alongside 2GB of RAM.

The 7-inch screen, which gives the tablet its name, is set to remain but the resolution has been quoted as 1980x1200 with 1080p quality.

It will run on Google's upcoming operating system, Android 4.3, and is rumoured as having a powerful 4,325mAh battery and support for 4G.

It could also feature speakers at the top and bottom of the device.

Official-looking paperwork posted by Engadget suggested the price of the next-generation gadget will be £150 ($229) for a 16GB version and £175 ($269) for a 32GB model.

The price of the original Nexus 7 tablet is also expected to drop following the announcement.
