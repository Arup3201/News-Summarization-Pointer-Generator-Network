Britain is happier today than a year ago – but only just.

New figures reveal the proportion of people who report high levels of life satisfaction has risen from 75.9 per cent to 77 per cent.

Experts claimed the London Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations could have helped to life the nation’s spirits.

Happier: The proportion of people rating their life satisfaction as 7 or more out of 10 rose from 75.9 per cent to 77 per cent

The data is the latest to emerge from David Cameron’s much-mocked Happiness Index. People are asked to rate their life satisfaction out of 10.

While there were rises in happiness between 2011-12 and 2012-13, there was also a fall in the proportion of people rating their anxiety at a higher level of six or more out of 10. It fell from 21.8 per cent to 20.9 per cent.

The study says factors influencing ‘personal well-being are complex and will differ from person to person’.

But it added: ‘The period of 2012/13 also included several special events in the UK, such as the Queen's Diamond Jubilee (in June 2012) which included a special bank holiday and the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic games (July to early September 2012).

‘These events could also have potentially influenced people's assessment of their personal well-being in the 2012/13 period.’

Cheers:  The Queen's Diamond Jubilee in June last year and British triumphs in the London Olympics, including Mo Farah winning gold in the 5,000 metres, helped lift the nation's spirits

Index: The proportion of people giving ratings of 4 or less out of 10 for happiness fell from 10.9 per cent to 10.3 per cent

The factors most associated with personal well-being are health, employment and relationship status.

The data show differences in personal well-being between groups of the population.

For example, people aged 45 to 49 rated their life satisfaction lower than any other age group and black people lower than any other ethnic group.

There were no significant changes between the years for unemployed people, whose average life satisfaction remained below those in employment.

Other non-official sources show an improvement in personal well-being for similar periods.

They also show that life satisfaction in the UK changed less between 2007 and 2011 than in other European countries.

Worthwhile: Eight out of 10 people gave high ratings when asked: 'Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?

Anxious: The proportion of people rating their anxiety at a low level of 3 or less out of 10 increased from 60.1 per cent to 61.5 per cent

Dawn Snape, ONS head of measuring well-being, said unemployment peaked in autumn 2011 but then decreased steadily throughout most of 2012.

She added that job vacancies had remained close to a record low in 2011 but began to rise in early 2012, continuing through to spring this year when it reached its highest since autumn 2008.

The ‘rosier’ employment picture could be taken as a sign of ‘optimism’ she said.

She added that the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations and the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in London might have been a factor in boosting happiness.

‘There are other events, obviously, that happened during the course of last year that might also have raised people's spirits, particularly the Queen's Diamond Jubilee with that extra holiday, and we have had the Olympics and Paralympics,’ she said.

‘All of those could potentially have influenced people's assessment of how well their life is going and how they feel overall and generally raise their spirits.’
