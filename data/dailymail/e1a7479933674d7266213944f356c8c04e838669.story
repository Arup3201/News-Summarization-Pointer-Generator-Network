Gianluigi Buffon gave Italy a late scare in training on Friday night when he twisted an ankle and was unable to complete the session in Manaus.

Buffon hobbled off but manager Cesare Prandelli remains optimistic that his captain and veteran goalkeeper will be available to face England.

Prandelli has enough defensive problems on his plate already. The Italy boss lost his first-choice left-back Mattia di Sciglio, when the AC Milan full-back suffered a calf strain in training on Thursday.

Concern: Italy manager Cesare Prandelli hopes Buffon will be fit to face England

It has not forced him home but he will not be fit for the Group D game in Manaus, which means a reshuffle at the back.

It was unclear whether the Italians would settle for switching 
Torino’s Matteo Darmian to the left and bring in Ignazio Abate of AC 
Milan at right-back, or whether he would move Giorgio Chiellini from 
centre-half to left-back and start with Parma’s Gabriel Paletta in the 
middle.

Defensive
 power has always been Italy’s great strength but Prandelli’s team have 
struggled at the back, which has already prompted the manager to push 
Andrea Pirlo forward from his preferred deep midfield role to 
accommodate Daniele de Rossi as a screener, protecting the 
centre-halves. He will be most reluctant to move Chiellini, who has been
 his rock.

If
 Buffon is anything other than 100 per cent, it will hurt Italy. The 
36-year-old Juventus goalkeeper is the country’s most-capped footballer 
of all time, has been first-choice in goal for nearly 15 years and won 
the World Cup in 2006.

Italy’s
 poor display four years ago in South Africa was largely attributed to 
his absence, when he was forced off with a sciatic nerve problem during 
the opening game.

'Pirlo
 and Buffon are our most important players,' said Chiellini. 'They’ve 
got character and they make the whole team play, so we need to take good
 care of them.'

Prandelli did not blame Buffon’s twist on the pitch in Manaus which is not perfect.
