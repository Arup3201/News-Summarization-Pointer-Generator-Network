She can hardly be blamed for keeping quiet since filing for divorce from Charles Saatchi earlier this year.

But what is perhaps surprising is how Nigella Lawson has chosen to break her silence – by blaming the feminist revolution for giving women a ‘sense of dread in the kitchen’.

The unexpected outburst was made as the food writer, 53, gave an interview to a Sunday newspaper.

She said she was ‘baffled’ to be asked if she considers herself a feminist, adding that it should be ‘self-evident’ that she is.

And despite forging a successful career based around being a ‘domestic goddess’ she said she recognised a reluctance among women to be ‘tied to the stove’.

Miss Lawson said: ‘Feeling comfortable in the kitchen is essential for everyone, male or female. At the time it seemed so many people were fearful of cooking, and that meant home was never more than a stop-off from work.

‘Women of my generation were keen - rightly - not to be tied to the stove, but the ramifications of this were that they felt a sense of dread in the kitchen. How can this be good for anyone?

‘I also feel that to denigrate any activity because it has traditionally been associated with the female sphere is in itself anti-feminist.’

Miss Lawson, who is filming a British version of her American cookery programme The Taste, made her name as the author of several best-selling cookbooks, including How To Be A Domestic Goddess, published in 2000.

In the past she has defended the book against critics, saying it should be seen as a ‘feminist tract’ that celebrates women.

And as she spoke to The Observer’s Food Monthly magazine, in an edition to mark the nominees of its Chef of the  Decade award, she addressed the issue once more.

She said: ‘When I wrote How to Be A Domestic Goddess, many felt I was saying that women’s place was in the kitchen, but the ironic pictures on the end papers (showing a Fifties housewife) surely undermined that, except for those people who consciously chose to misread my intent.’

'Women of my generation were keen - rightly - not to be tied to the stove, but the ramifications of this were that they felt a sense of dread in the kitchen. How can this be good for anyone?'

Miss Lawson’s comments come after she returned to London from Los Angeles, where she was filming for The Taste. She is said to be looking for a property in North London, after moving out of the marital home she shared with Mr Saatchi.

Miss Lawson, who began her career as a journalist, also said she thinks readers can relate to her because she doesn’t label herself a chef.

She said: ‘I am not a chef; I am not even a trained cook. So yes, I do think the fact that I am a bit of a kitchen klutz, and fit cooking into an already busy life (and I started writing food books when I was a non-food columnist with young children) means that I cook in much the same way as my readers, or viewers.

‘Real cooking, the sort that goes on in homes, does not have to be tricky or difficult and I felt it was important to demonstrate that.’
