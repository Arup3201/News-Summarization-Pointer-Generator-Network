If you're budget sits somewhere between the cost of a car and an aftershave this Christmas, one beauty brand think they have the answer.

French crystal manufacturer Lalique has joined forces with British luxury car maker Bentley Motors to create a male fragrance.

However, lucky recipients of the Lalique for Bentley Crystal Edition will have to be liberal with the scent because it costs a staggering £3,000.

The gleaming crystal design comprises a square base and the iconic 'Flying B' Bentley mascot. 

The scent is 'fine woody notes and exquisite leather to complement the epicentres of excellence within Bentley’s craftsmanship', say the brands.

'For most men, a Bentley is in their wildest dreams. This bottle is only a fraction of the cost of just an average Bentley giving men a touch of luxury for a fraction of the cost,' reads the information released by the firms.

A spokesman for feelunique.com, who are 
selling the perfume, said: 'We’re extremely excited to be 
stocking this limited edition fragrance on our site.

'Fragrance
is clearly a huge seller for us at this time of the year and we’re 
delighted to be able to offer our customers the chance to be able to get
hold of this masterpiece.'

Can't afford a Bentley? The fragrance, which comprises a square shaped base and the iconic 'Flying B' Bentley mascot, may be the perfect answer for your man this Christmas

Beauty blogger Charlie Lankston, from Little Fish Big Pond, added: ‘I think this is definitely the kind of fragrance you buy the man who has everything.

'Any Bentley-driving billionaires would no doubt be thrilled to find this unique scent nestled under the tree - as would many aspiring Bentley owners I’m sure.

‘But for the masses I think this might just be a bit too extravagant a gift to give - no matter how sweetly scented it may be!

'Choosing a fragrance can be quite a personal experience for the wearer so I would make sure the lucky man in question will be suited to this scent before spending £3,000.’
