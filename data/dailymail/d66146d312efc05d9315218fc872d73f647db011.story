Most of Britain is basking in the sunshine after a cool morning gave way to a fine Spring Saturday.

People were spotted exploring colourful gardens in Hampshire and taking a stroll on the beach in Norfolk as England and Wales enjoyed a cloud-free day.

The unbroken sunshine saw temperatures creeping up into the mid-teens, with highs of 12 to 13C in London, for what the Met Office described as a 'pleasant day'.

In the Scottish Highlands there were light bursts of rain while Shetland had the lowest temperature of the day so far at 8C.

North-west Scotland had a mixed day of light wind and rain and there was cloud across Northern Ireland and northern England.

Meanwhile, runners preparing for tomorrow's London Marathon can take heart from the news that they are in for 'good running weather', according to Met Office spokesman Michael Lawrence.

The race, led by double Olympic champion Mo Farah, will start at 9am under clear skies and a cool 6C - just above the 2004 record low of 5.3C for the event.

Mo Farah will lead more than 37,000 people racing in the London Marathon tomorrow - and runners can expect a cool start to the morning

The temperature will creep up to 15C by 
midday and early afternoon when the first finishers cross the line after
26.2miles around the capital.

By the end of the afternoon, the last 
runners down to the Mall's finish line should do so under a bit of cloud
and possibly a few spots of rain as cloud moves in from the west of the
country.

But the weekend's fine weather is not
expected to last. Monday will be a cloudy day for most of the UK, with a
wet day predicted for the west.

By Tuesday, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the far north of England will still be cloudy, with MeteoGroup predicting light rain.

Most
of England and Wales will enjoy a warm Tuesday, with temperatures in 
the mid-teens and the occasional glimpse of bright sunshine once early 
morning drizzle has cleared, while there will be frost in the north.

Bands
of rain will mix with bursts of sunshine and breezier weather during 
the coming week but from next weekend there will be a 'colder blip', 
said Mr Lawrence, with wintery showers on northern hills and the return 
of a few frosts and rain showers across the country.
