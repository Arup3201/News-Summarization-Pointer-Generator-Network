CLICK HERE to read the full story on Malky Mackay's offensive text about Cardiff chairman Vincent Tan. 

Former FA chairman Lord Triesman has called for Malky Mackay to be banned from football for at least a year after Sportsmail revealed his racist text and email exchanges with Iain Moody.

Although Mackay insisted he was guilty of sending only three racist texts ‘out of 10,000’ recovered from Moody’s phone as part of a Cardiff City investigation into eight transfers during his tenure as manager, this newspaper revealed another tranche of messages that further exposed the 42-year-old Scot on Saturday morning. In one, Cardiff believe Mackay called Malaysian club owner Vincent Tan a ‘chink’.

Mackay gave a TV interview on Friday night in which he insisted he was not racist, sexist or homophobic. He did, however, accept that the texts he sent to Moody — then head of recruitment at Cardiff and until his resignation last week the sporting director at Crystal Palace — were ‘unacceptable’ and ‘inappropriate’.

Offensive: Mackay referred to Cardiff owner Vincent Tan (L) as a 'chink' in one particular text message

Punishment: Former FA chairman Lord Triesman believes Mackay should be banned for a whole season

Sportsmail understands there is a real appetite at the FA to punish both Mackay and Moody. The governing body has made no comment because it could prejudice their investigation after evidence was passed to Wembley officials by Cardiff’s lawyers. But insiders at the FA expect the two men to be charged in the belief that this cannot be compared to previous cases, in which privacy has been given as a reason not to proceed.

Triesman, who served as FA chairman between 2008 and 2010, told the BBC yesterday that Mackay should be banned from football for a season simply on the strength of the three messages he has admitted sending.

‘There could very well be a significant period in which he can take no part in football,’ said Triesman.

‘If it turns out to be three texts then maybe a season (ban), if it’s more than that may be much more. Assuming that the evidence is stacked up — I can’t pre-try it — I think the FA, in the same sense that it can say to players, “Here is a period in which you can take no part in playing”, could do so with other people in football.’

Lord Ouseley, the chairman of anti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out, told the BBC yesterday that the case highlights a greater need to address prejudice and bigotry in sport.

‘It’s very difficult to prescribe what is appropriate,’ he said. ‘My concern is that we’re talking about one individual and focusing on that individual and I understand why that is, but we’re talking about the wider implications for the game. 

'Malky Mackay is probably thinking, “Hey, I’m unlucky, I’ve got into a situation where all my texts have been forensically examined”. If that happened to every other football manager, senior administrator and other people at top levels of the game then there wouldn’t be many people working in the football, the game might just collapse.

‘I think what we have got to recognise is that there is a serious problem about prejudice and bigotry and where that is in the hands of people with power, something’s got to be done and it’s got to be done now.

‘The Malky Mackay case is a microcosm that enables us to focus on what is a real, serious problem. If football is going to get to grips with this it has an opportunity now and that’s why the role of the FA is important.

‘You can say a season, two seasons, whatever, if we think that’s it, close it off, we’ve dealt with that and the problem is over, it isn’t.’
