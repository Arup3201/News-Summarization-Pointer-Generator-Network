Valentine's day just got tech-savvy: A luxury phone company is to release an iPhone 6 that has a pink case.

The device has all the features of a regular iPhone 6, but its added colour could make owners of more ‘bland’ iPhones extremely jealous.

Especially when they discover that the limited edition pink iPhone 6 can be only purchased for the princely sum of £1,899 ($2,887).

A London-based luxury phone company is releasing a pink iPhone 6 (shown). It is the same as a regular iPhone 6 - but has a pink case. It costs £1,899 ($2,887), while a gold version is also being released for £2,499 ($3,797) for anyone who wants to splash out even more

The phone - which is prestigiously claimed to be the world’s first pink iPhone 6 - is being released by London-based luxury brand Amosu.

They are making just ten of the limited edition devices, so punters will have to be quick if they want to spend quite a large amount of money for a phone with a pink case.

Amosu are also planning to release a gold version of an iPhone 6, which will sell for an eye-watering £2,499 ($3,797).

- Three regular iPhone 6 phones

- 1,520 loaves of bread

- 47 toasters

- Five Xbox One games consoles

- Four flights from London to New York 

‘With Valentine’s Day just round the corner, a lot of gifting items decked out in the color pink have started flooding the markets,’ said a press release.

‘Luxury brand Amosu, well known for having a penchant for things that are flashy, luxurious and expensive, has introduced the world’s first pink Apple iPhone 6.

‘Amosu is the same company that launched the pink iPhone 5 two years back on Valentine’s Day.’

In pictures the phone also seems to have the words ‘World’s first pink iPhone 6’ printed on the bottom of the case.

It’s likely this will be taken off the final version, so that the aesthetics of the device are not ruined.

The exact release date has not been revealed, but it’s assumed it will be on or before Valentine’s Day this year.
