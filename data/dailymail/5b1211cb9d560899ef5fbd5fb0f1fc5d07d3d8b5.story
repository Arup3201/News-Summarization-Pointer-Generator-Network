Illegal immigrants and terrorist suspects with no right to remain in Britain will be forced out of the country quicker after David Cameron said he would cut short their appeals yesterday.

The Prime Minister announced plans to speed up government, including overhauling the system of judicial reviews which lawyers can use to protest against the government.

The plans were billed as a way of curtailing opposition to new infrastructure projects but the vast majority of judicial reviews concern immigration cases.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last night confirmed that the plans will prevent those with no right to be in Britain delaying their deportation for as long in future.

David Cameron has revealed plans to cut short appeals by illegal immigrants and terror suspects in the wake of the Abu Hamza fiasco. Hamza used judicial reviews of extradition arrangements to hold up his removal

Hook handed hate preacher Abu Hamza is one of dozens of terrorist suspects who have sought judicial review of their extradition arrangements to hold up their removal.

But tens of thousands of ordinary immigration cases also get mired in time consuming judicial review cases.

In future the government plans to increase the cost of judicial reviews, reduce the time period in which people can bring a case and reduce the number of appeals from four to two.

Speaking at the CBI conference in London, Mr Cameron said judicial review had become a 'massive growth industry' which was delaying action and costing taxpayers too much money.

‘We urgently needed to get a grip on this.’ Mr Grayling told the Mail: ‘People who do not have the right to remain in this country should not be in the position of being able to lodge trivial challenges to delay their removal, even when they know they have no chance of success.

‘This is why I am looking to change the system so public time and money are not wasted on spurious claims that clog up our courts.’ 

The number of judicial review applications has rocketed in the past three decades, from 160 in 1974 to 11,200 last year - an increase of almost 7,000 per cent.

At the same time, the proportion of successful applications is very low and amount to little more than time wasting.In 2011 only one in six applications determined were granted permission to be heard and even fewer were successful when they went ahead.

Mr Cameron used his speech to the CBI to demand an end to further regulations, axing politically correct equalities red tape in Whitehall departments to speed up new policies to boost growth.

And he said the government has already scrapped guidelines which forced ministers to hold a three month consultation on major policies when they could just as soon consult the relevant parties in a couple of weeks.

The PM said he was 'calling time' on Government departments having to make Equality Impact Assessments, which assess how policies affect ethnic minorities and the disabled.

He said: 'We have smart people in Whitehall who consider equalities issues while they’re making the policy. We don’t need all this extra tick-box stuff.

'Mr Cameron said: ‘In government we have taken the letter of this law and gone way beyond it, with Equality Impact Assessments for every decision we make.

'Let me be very clear. I care about making sure we treat people equally. But let’s have the courage to say it - caring about these things does not have to mean churning out reams of bureaucratic nonsense.

'We have smart people in Whitehall who consider equalities issues while they’re making the policy.

'We don’t need all this extra tick-box stuff.’ Mr Cameron said that too often ministers announced policies which then got bogged down in Whitehall red tape.

'When we came to power there had to be a three-month consultation on everything - and I mean everything, no matter how big or small,” he said.

'So we are saying to ministers: here’s a revolutionary idea - you decide how long a consultation period this actually needs.

'If you can get it done properly in a fortnight - great. Indeed, the Department for Education has already had a consultation done and dusted in two weeks. If there is no need for a consultation, then don’t have one.'
