He was the first man in Britain to be signed off work with morning sickness but that hasn't stopped security guard Harry Ashby, 29, from Birmingham, from reaching the finals of the Britain’s Most Manliest Man competition.

Mr Ashby made headlines last month after it was revealed that he had been given a doctor's note after falling prey to the same nausea and back pain suffered by his pregnant fiancée Charlotte Allsopp, 29.

But despite the unusually feminine complaint, Mr Ashby says he is as manly as anyone else and added that being a real man means supporting your family and being honest about how you feel.

Manly: Mr Ashby, 29, has now made the finals of the Britain's Most Manliest Man competition

'A real man for me is someone who can provide for his family and friends and be honest about what he wants to say,' explained the part-time model who claims to have made more than £20,000 to date from his good looks.

'For most men everything’s got to be positive and macho. I don’t mind coming out and talking about what I did.

'I still get the sickness and I haven’t shifted the weight I put on yet but once the baby’s born I’m going to get back down the gym.'

Mr Ashby, who says he hopes to make it onto Big Brother next, beat more than 1,000 hopefuls to make it into the final of the competition, along with 49 others. 

In his entry Mr Ashby described his most manliest achievement as 'I once helped an old lady who had fallen down on the street.'

His hobbies were listed as singing, modelling and science fiction. An online poll will now decide who brings home the title from the tournament held by grooming brand, The Bluebeards Revenge, men’s cancer charity Orchid and Men’s Fitness magazine.

Last month, Mr Ashby made headlines when it was revealed that he was suffering from Couvade Syndrome, in which men develop symptoms similar to those of morning sickness.

The name Couvade syndrome (also known as male sympathetic pregnancy) comes from the French 'couver', which means 'to hatch'.

It is not a medically recognised condition, although a 2007 study showed that 11 out of 282 expectant fathers surveyed had gone to their GP with symptoms similar to those of their pregnant partners.

Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, weight gain, food cravings, tiredness, depression, fainting and toothache.

In more extreme cases, men may develop breasts and a pregnant-looking stomach.

Some sufferers said their symptoms subsided as the pregnancy went on, while others said lasted up to and during the labour.

Now back at work, Mr Ashby added: 'I think people should back me because I’ve been working hard for 10 years and it would be great to win the title.

Finding fame: Mr Ashby and his fiancee Charlotte also appeared on This Morning to tell their story

Uncomfortable: Mr Ashby's 'morning sickness' has seen him pile on the pounds and suffer from nausea

'I want to branch out and get on Big Brother - that’s one of my main aims to make some money and a name for myself. I’ve put so much work into this.

'Life’s hard and I don’t mind working but at the same time I’m a big dreamer.”

Jacob Anthony Lott, aged 21 and also from Birmingham, and Solihull businessman RS, aged 24, also appear in the shortlist.

Describing the title as 'life changing' organiser Nick Gibbens said: 'We don’t define what’s manly - we’ll let you decide on that one. 

'But we do know that these guys look the part, with their chiselled jawlines, rugged good looks and masculine physiques.

'Of course, there’s more to it than looks alone, and this is something that we feel should be given careful consideration.'

The winner will bag a one year modelling contract and work to encourage other men to check themselves for testicular, penile and prostate cancer.
