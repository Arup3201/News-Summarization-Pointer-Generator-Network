Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby today broke his silence of the lobbying scandal which has dogged Number 10 to insist he did not tell David Cameron to ditch high profile health policies.

Mr Crosby denied
that he has had 'any conversation or discussion' with the Prime Minister
on the issue of plain packaging of cigarettes.

Mr Crosby, whose lobbying firm is reported to have worked
for tobacco giant Philip Morris, said that any suggestion that he had used his
position as an adviser improperly was 'simply false'.

Row: The role of lobbyist Lynton Crosby in shaping government policy has led to accusations of a conflict of interest in David Cameron's government

Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused Mr Cameron
of 'bringing big tobacco to the heart of Downing Street' by hiring
the Australian polls guru as an adviser shortly before ditching plans for
standardised cigarette packages.

But in a statement issued today by his company CTF
Partners, Mr Crosby said: 'The Prime Minister has repeatedly and clearly
said that I have never lobbied him on anything, including on the issue of
tobacco or plain packaging of cigarettes.'

In recent days Mr Cameron has been careful in the wording of his responses to questions about Mr Crosby's influence since becoming a part-time stratgist for the Tory party.

At the weekend the PM refused to say whether he had spoken to his election strategist about the issue – simply that Mr Crosby ‘has not intervened... that’s the answer you’re getting’.

Vote: European Parliament will vote tomorrow on legislation that could see larger health warnings placed on cigarette packets, similar to standardised packaging in Australia, pictured

Delay: Laws passed in Australia mean cigarette 
packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking,
 but the UK government will not follow suit

But in his statement Mr Crosby went further. He said: 'What the PM said should be enough for any ordinary
person but to avoid any doubt or speculation let me be clear.

'At no time have I
had any conversation or discussion with or lobbied the Prime Minister, or
indeed the Health Secretary or the health minister, on plain packaging or
tobacco issues.

'Indeed, any claim that I have sought to improperly
use my position as part-time campaign adviser to the Conservative Party is
simply false.'

Cancer charities and MPs today condemned the government for shelving plans to firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets.

Ministers were accused of putting jobs in the tobacco industry ahead of saving lives.

Dr Sarah Wollaston, a Tory MP and former GP, condemned the decision as a 'tragic waste of an opportunity'.

She claimed there would be 'more lives ruined for political expediency'.

Writing on Twitter, Dr Wollaston added: 'R.I.P public health. A day of shame for this government; the only winners big tobacco, big alcohol and big undertakers.'
