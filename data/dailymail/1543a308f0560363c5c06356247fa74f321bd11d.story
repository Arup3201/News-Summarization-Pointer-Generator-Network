When Countdown host Nick Hewer was asked to take a photo of a tourist, he was happy to oblige.

But the presenter soon regretted his decision – after discovering that the stranger had used the photo opportunity to make off with his designer watch.

The 70-year-old star’s wristwatch is believed to be worth up to £10,000 and was created by the International Watch Company, which is also known as the IWC.

On Wednesday the star of the Channel 4 quiz show quickly informed his 190,000 Twitter followers of the theft, writing: ‘Anyone seen my IWC?’

He added: ‘NEVER agree to take photo of stranger with their camera phone. They’ll steal your watch so fast when you hand phone back.’

Yesterday a spokesman for Mr Hewer, who is also known for his appearances on BBC show The Apprentice, confirmed that he had reported the incident to police.
