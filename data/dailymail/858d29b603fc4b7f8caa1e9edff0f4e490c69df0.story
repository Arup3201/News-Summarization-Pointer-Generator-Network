A solicitor and a gang who organised fake weddings have been jailed for more than 16 years.

Mohammed Akhtar, 28, used his job as a solicitor to make contact with immigrants from the sub-continent whose visas had expired.

His partners in crime mother and son pair Vera Horvatova, 53, and Leon Horvat, 21, recruited women from the Czech community in Wolverhampton, West Midlands to act as fake brides.

Akhtar carried out his fraud for more than a year, charging hefty fees for his services before he was caught in in July last year.

He methodically compiled dossiers for each ‘couple’, which contained staged photographs to give the appearance the bride and groom were long-term lovers.

Akhtar also doctored bank statements and employment references and even wrote a fake love letter for one case.

But the authorities cottoned on to Akhtar’s scheme when they were notified about a suspicious marriage by Wolverhampton Register Office.

Home office officials attended the office on July 26 and arrested him along with three other people.

Akhtar, of Wolverhampton, pleaded guilty to 11 counts of conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of immigration law by a non-EU person and asked for 10 other counts to be taken into consideration.

He was jailed for five years at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Thursday along with eight others in a scheme the judge said was ‘a sophisticated criminal conspiracy developed to make money’.

The court heard foreign national Sandeep Bhullar had been given 60 days’ notice to leave the UK in July last year when she contacted Akhtar.

He then plotted to give her the right to stay in the country by claiming his fixer Leon Horvat was her lover.

A file found at Akhtar’s home contained stage photographs of the pair pretending to be a couple as well as a letter giving her blessing from Horvat’s mother Vera Horvatova.

Horvat of Wolverhampton, was jailed for 32 months after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law by a non-EU person, one count of participating in a sham marriage and one count of conspiring to arrange a shame marriage.

And his mother Horvatova, also of Wolverhampton, was caged for three years after she admitted charges relating to conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law by a non-EU person.

Six other people involved in the sham were also jailed after admitting the same charge – while one woman was given a suspended sentence.

Prosecutor Elisabeth Bussey-Jones told the court: ‘Akhtar was the key organiser. The arrangements involved large sums paid by foreign nationals. His motive was clearly profit.’

Speaking 
about when suspicions were aroused on July 4 last year, she added: 
‘[Akhtar] claimed to be present with the bride and groom as an 
interpreter and a witness to the wedding.

But staff became suspicious when the couple showed very little interaction and appeared to know nothing about one another.’

The amount Akhtar charged for his services will not be revealed until a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing takes place in October this year.

Home Office Inspector Andy Radcliffe said sums ranging between £1,000 and £10,000 are common for sham weddings.

Insp Radcliffe – who headed the 10-month investigation which led to the arrests – said: ‘This was a long-running, successful operation which has resulted in substantial prison sentences being handed out to those involved.

‘The system is designed to help genuine couples stay in the UK but others like Akhtar try to exploit it for financial gain.

‘In terms of identifying participants we are reliant on information from registrars and members of the public to help us.

‘Finding and prosecuting these individuals is very much a priority for the Home Office.

‘It is possible that some of them didn’t see it as a crime as there is no identifiable victim.

‘But the tax-paying public in the UK is the real victim.’
