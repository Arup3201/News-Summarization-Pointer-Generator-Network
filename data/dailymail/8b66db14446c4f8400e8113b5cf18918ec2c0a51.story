Denis Tuohy was anxious.

As a 27-year-old TV presenter he'd been chosen as the first face to be seen on the eagerly anticipated new BBC2 channel.

It was the night of 20 April, 1964, and he was due on screen in little more than half an hour, at 7.20pm. After rehearsing all day for his historic role that would inaugurate the first challenge to ITV and the BBC's single channel, his stomach was churning and every nerve jangled.

'I was in the studio trying to find a way to relax,' he recalls now. 'Suddenly it went black. Kaput! It was as though someone, somewhere, had suddenly switched everything off.'

A fire at London's Battersea Power Station had cut all power to a huge swathe of the western side of the capital, including BBC Television Centre. BBC1 was able to switch to emergency recorded programmes from its Alexandra Palace studio in North London, which was unaffected by the power cut. But what about BBC2?

The channel - heavily promoted over several weeks by a cartoon kangaroo called Hullabaloo and her joey Custard - was due to begin with Denis introducing a collection of previews called Line-Up, followed by variety acts, a production of Cole Porter's Kiss Me, Kate and a firework display from Southend.

'Nobody knew if the power would be restored quickly, or if we'd be kicking our heels for hours,' says Tuohy, now 77.

'The waiting didn't help our frayed nerves.' At TV Centre everyone was in the dark - literally. 'My editor, Rowan Ayers, rushed in,' remembers Tuohy. 'I asked, "What can we do?" He shrugged and said, "Not much." We waited in the studio for an hour-and-a-half in the hope that the power might come back on.'

It was during this interlude that Tuohy overheard an astonishing conversation between two unnamed BBC executives in the darkened studio. They were blaming ITV for deliberately sabotaging the new channel's opening.

Nine years earlier, in September 1955, the launch of ITV had been upstaged by a deliberate BBC spoiler - the fictional death in a fire of Grace Archer, a stalwart of radio's The Archers, an event which made front page news.

'One of the executives was saying that the Battersea power cut was ITV's revenge for Grace Archer,' says Tuohy. He said, "It's all too much of a coincidence. How did Grace Archer die? In a fire. What scuppered BBC2? A fire."â€‰'

The sabotage theory was soon discounted, however. London ITV station Associated-Rediffusion generously offered to transmit BBC2's programmes, but because they'd have to wait until the ITV schedules finished for the night, this was declined.

Tuohy says, 'We finally decided that if power hadn't come back by 9.45 we'd abandon everything and start BBC2 the following night.'

The presenter, who was recruited for the launch from BBC Northern Ireland, went home deeply depressed. 'I remember thinking I've come all the way over from Ireland to make my name and look what happened,' he says.

By next morning the power lines were back in service, and in spite of all the grand plans for the original launch, the first scheduled programme shown was Play School at 11am.

A second launch took place exactly 24 hours after the aborted show. At 7.20pm on Tuesday, 21 April, cameras focused on a darkened studio with a candle burning on a desk. It was the infant BBC2 - at last.

Tuohy says, 'Right on cue, I walked into shot and picked up the candle. As the lights came up, I blew it out and said, "Good evening. My name is Denis Tuohy. This is the studio from which BBC2 programmes will start each evening from now on." That was it. We were on air.'

'Suddenly it went black. Kaput! It was as though someone, somewhere, had suddenly switched everything off.'

Now, half a century after that disastrous night, BBC2 is making up for it by celebrating the anniversary. A cornucopia of special programmes are being planned.

David Attenborough, a former BBC2 controller, and Joan Bakewell will be among the pioneers taking part. 'David was the most innovative of all,' says Tuohy, who cites Attenborough's introduction of The Forsyte Saga, Dave Allen, rugby league and one-day cricket.

'He was always very supportive. 
During his term I was chairing a Late Night Line-Up discussion about 
British comedy. Till Death Us Do Part writer Johnny Speight and comic 
Marty Feldman arrived very drunk, and it was difficult to shut Johnny 
up.

Meanwhile, comedy 
writer John Antrobus had been in the BBC bar but hadn't been invited to 
take part in the programme. He burst into the studio shouting, "S** the 
viewers", and had to be restrained by staff. The show went out live and I
 was told in my earpiece by the director to keep going for as long as I 
thought I should.

'Afterwards
 I got a call from Attenborough, my boss. "I've only one question," he 
said. "How many drinks did we give Johnny and Marty?" I said none. "OK, 
fine," he said. "But there's going to be trouble. Leave this to me. And,
 by the way, I think you should go and have a drink yourself now."'

It
 was Attenborough who introduced colour in 1967. He says he needed a 
prestigious series to showcase the new format. 'I wanted to show all the
 loveliest things human beings have made in Western Europe in the last 
1,000 years, accompanied by the loveliest contemporary music,' he 
explains. The result was the Kenneth Clark triumph Civilisation, now to 
be remade by the BBC.

However, Attenborough was critical of BBC2 when it celebrated its 40th anniversary. 'I am not in need of visual chewing gum,' he said then. 'I don't watch soaps, and Trinny and thingy are not going to affect the kind of cardigan I wear. The BBC output has certainly changed and not towards my taste.'

Dame Joan Bakewell agrees that BBC2 has changed. 'It doesn't live up to its pioneering times.' Her arrival there, in the summer of 1964, created an immediate sensation. 'To have a woman as one of the four presenters on Late Night Line-Up was exceptional,' she says.

'It was the late (comedy writer) Frank Muir who named me The Thinking Man's Crumpet, which has taken me a lifetime to live down. It was meant as a compliment, but it was a little bit of a put-down, although I couldn't mind.'

That disastrous launch night couldn't hold BBC2 back, and it went on to broadcast ground-breaking shows from The Office to Fawlty Towers, Newsnight, Have I Got News For You and Gardeners' World. More recently BBC2 has introduced Miranda, Twenty Twelve and The Great British Bake Off.

'The lesson of the power failure was "No mistake, no publicity, big mistake, big publicity",' says

Michael Peacock, the inaugural controller of BBC2. 'Only 7 per cent of viewers could receive the channel at the time. Had the launch gone smoothly, the nation may not have known BBC2 had gone on the air. As it was, everybody knew we hadn't!'

BBC2's 50th anniversary celebrations begin with Pop Goes BBC2 tonight at 10pm.
