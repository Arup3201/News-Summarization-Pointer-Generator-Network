Paul John Scott, 32, one of Britain's most wanted fugitives has been arrested after trying to sneak back into Britain in a light aircraft

A suspected drug smuggler named as one of Britain's most wanted men has been arrested after trying to sneak back into the UK from Holland in a light aircraft.

Paul John Scott, 32, a suspected member of a drug-dealing gang, was stopped by police after he touched down at East Winch Airfield in Norfolk from the Netherlands in a Cessna 170, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. 

The plane's Dutch pilot, who was also arrested on suspicion of money laundering, has been bailed pending further enquiries.

Scott, from Liverpool,  was accused of being in possession of 2,000 euros and a false Belgian identity card.

He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine and appeared at Liverpool Magistrates Court yesterday. 

He was remanded in custody until his next court appearance at Liverpool Crown Court on January 2.

Scott is a suspected member of a Merseyside-based organised crime group that plotted to smuggle up to 40 tonnes of drugs into the UK, the NCA said. 

The arrest on Tuesday night comes two weeks after the NCA launched a manhunt for Scott and issued an appeal on BBC One's Crimewatch show.

Officers from Norfolk Police and Border Force were waiting for the aircraft to touch down as suspicions had been raised ten days earlier when the pilot landed in the same airfield in a different aircraft.
