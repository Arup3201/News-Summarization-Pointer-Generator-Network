One police union is pushing for cop killings to be included in the federal hate crimes law.

The National Fraternal Order of Police is asking that crimes against police be added to the Congressional hate crimes statute. 

A hate crime is currently defined by Congress as a 'criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, ethnic origin or sexual orientation.'

This comes in the wake of the recent killing of two cops in New York City.

Tragedy: This in the wake of the ambush killing of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos (left) and Wenjian Liu (right)

NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were killed last month by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, a man who posted anti-police messages on social media and shot the men dead in an ambush attack.

According to the FBI, '21.7 percent of non-accidental law enforcement deaths since 2004 were ambush attacks.'

Yahoo News reports that the Fraternal Order, which has 300,000 members, wrote a letter to Congress and President Obama this week addressing their concerns.

'Right now, it’s a hate crime if you attack someone solely because of the color of their skin, but it ought to be a hate crime if you attack someone solely because of the color of their uniform as well,' said executive director Jim Pasco.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said when asked about the initiative it was 'something that we'll have to consider.'

The hate crime statue has been expanded before, most recently in 2009 when disabilities and sexual orientation were added by Congress.

It is still not certain who in Congress might take up this bill, especially as violent deaths of police officers on duty have dropped drastically from just a few decades ago.

That being said, the group is still intent on getting harsher penalties for those that take down officers in the line of duty.

Said the union's president, Chuck Canterbury; 'Enough is enough! It’s time for Congress to do something to protect the men and women who protect us.'
