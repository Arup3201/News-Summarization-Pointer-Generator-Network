Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond opened up a Cabinet split yesterday by questioning government plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes.

He said there were concerns the scheme could lead to a rise in the smuggling of illicit cigarettes, depriving the Treasury of revenue.

His comments came a day after David Cameron finally threw his weight behind laws forcing tobacco firms to sell products in standard packaging bearing only grisly health warnings.

The government has announced plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes that includes grisly warnings about the dangers of smoking

MPs will have a free vote on the plans before the election but are expected to back them, with the law expected to come into force next year. 

But Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 5 Live the issue was complex, and he would look ‘very carefully’ at the evidence before deciding how to vote.

‘It’s a complex issue because experiments have happened around the world,’ he said. ‘It’s very important to look at the evidence of those experiments and see what the evidence shows.

‘Also some concerns have been expressed about whether it’s going to make the counterfeiting of cigarettes easier and increasing trade, which deprives us of a lot of revenue.’ A packet of 20 cigarettes costs £8.47 on average, of which £6.49 is tax.

Smoke from e-cigarettes at ‘high voltage’ levels is more toxic than tobacco because it contains higher levels of cancer-causing formaldehyde, a study has found.

A study found that e-cigarette smoke can contain up to 15 times more formaldehyde than traditional tobacco, though other research says that the electronic devices are safer than normal cigarettes

The amount of the chemical inhaled by e-cigarette users can be between five and 15 times higher than from smoking normal cigarettes, researchers said.

Battery-powered e-cigarettes convert liquid nicotine into a mist, allowing users to inhale the drug while avoiding the harm caused by tobacco smoke, a process known as ‘vaping’. 

Users change the voltage to decide how much vapour they want.

The US study looked at smoke from e-cigarettes with a ‘tank system’ at various voltages. 

David Peyton, a chemistry professor at Portland State University who helped conduct the research, warned that e-cigarettes were not ‘absolutely safe’. 

Colleague James Pankow said: ‘There are toxins and some are (there) more than in regular cigarettes.

‘If you are vaping, you probably shouldn’t use a high-voltage setting.’

However the study is at odds with research last year by Queen Mary University of London which found e-cigarettes cause less harm than smoking tobacco to users and bystanders.

 Other studies into e-cigarettes have been inconclusive about their dangers.

In 2011, Mr Hammond was treated to more than £1,000 worth of hospitality at the Chelsea Flower Show by Japan Tobacco International.

The company, which owns Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut cigarettes, tried and failed to overturn a ban on the display of tobacco in shops introduced by former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley.

Medical experts say non-smokers, and younger children in particular, are likely to find plain packaging less appealing. 

Philip Hammond said the issue is 'complex' and that the packaging scheme could lead to smuggling

But right-wing Tory backbenchers see it as a ‘nanny state’ measure, and others are concerned it would lead to job losses.

One law firm said plain cigarette packaging could be the thin end of the wedge, with alcohol, chocolate and fizzy drinks targeted next. 

Tom Scourfield, head of intellectual property at CMS, said: ‘This is a first foray into depriving proprietary rights to perfectly legal products to discourage their consumption.’

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the plan was ineffectual and ‘counter to freedom, the basic building block of prosperity’.

Liberal Democrat communities minister Stephen Williams admitted there was division within the Government over plain packaging.

Tory MP Dame Angela Watkinson said she would not vote in favour of plain packaging despite being a life-long non-smoker.

‘There can’t be anyone in this country, young or old, who does not know about the health risks of tobacco,’ she said. ‘Nobody smokes in ignorance.’
