Many young girls dream of careers, marriage, fun and happiness and endlessly plot and plan tne best ways to get what they want out of life.

And though for many young women, dreams of houses and lasting love are high on the list for one Chinese woman, fulfillment lay in becoming a monk.

However, in her former life Ting Tien, 24, enjoyed an affluent lifestyle full of designer clothes and make up.

After posting a photo of herself online in her new life, Ting, pictured here with her parents, became a hit across China

But she made the decision to abandon her life of comfort and luxury in Jinan City in Eastern China and shave her head, to follow a life of, sacrifice and prayer as a Buddhist monk.

It was only after graduating from Qingdao University in Shandong Province, Ting became disillusioned with the lifestyle she and her fellow career minded friends were leading, finding it increasingly materialistic.

She retreated to a monastery called Xinlongdongzhi Temple, 13,000 feet up a snow covered mountain in Sichuan Province, and there, she said, she found fulfilment in the search for true enlightenment.

She changed her name to Caizhenwangmu, and spends her day in prayer and meditation in a life of Buddhist spiritual fulfilment.

She is surrounded by fellow monks who have shunned the material world to live their cloistered existence.

The picture she posted of herself on line led many to question why she would give up so much, to which Ting responds she needed to gain and understanding of life and death

In her previous life Ting Tien liked the same designer clothes and make up as other young woman and many have applauded her decision in a country where the pursuit of money and success is now a national mania

After posting a photo of herself online in her new life, she became a hit across China. In a country where the pursuit of money and success is now a national mania, many applauded her for choosing a different, more tranquil path in life.

But there were also others who could not understand why she would give up the material world for the secular one.

Responding on her Twitter account, she said: 'It is hard to answer why I choose to be a monk. Nothing bad had happened to me, and I'm not trying to escape from the world.

'I just feel a need to gain an understanding of life and death, and what it's all about.

'I'm also eager to do what I can to make the world a better place for all living creatures. What's more, believing in Buddha makes me a monk.'
