A couple who both suffered serious injuries in the Boston bombings have won a dream wedding.

Pete DiMartino, from Rochester, New York, proposed to Rebekah Gregory, from Richmond, Texas, in October after the tragedy made them realize just how important they were to each other.

Wedding website 'The Knot' heard of the couple's story and has now named them the winner of its 2014 dream wedding contest, meaning that their entire wedding will be free.

But there's a hitch: the website's visitors will help plan the wedding by voting on everything from the location to the dress and the cake.

Joy: Boston bombing survivors Rebekah Gregory and Pete DiMartino show off her engagement ring after he proposed in October. The couple has now won their dream wedding from a wedding website

Joy: Rebekah said she screamed 'yes!' before Pete could even ask her to marry him last October

The couple told the website they were shocked to have been chosen as the winners.

'We're getting our fairytale ending after
 all,' Rebekah, 26, said on a video accepting the prize. 'I don't know 
if I'll be able to walk down the aisle, but all i want to do is marry 
the love of my life, Pete.'

The couple will marry this spring, and
 visitors can now vote on which city it will be held: Rebekah's hometown
 of Louisville, Kentucky, Pete's hometown in New York and their favorite
 vacation spot of Asheville, North Carolina.

The final choice is Boston, with the website adding: 'Let's make a happy memory for the city.'

The couple both suffered serious leg injuries as they and Rebekah's young son Noah cheered on her mother at the finish line of the marathon on April 15 last year.

When the blast detonated - killing three people and wounding 275 others - Rebekah's body acting as a shield to her son.

On the mend: Rebekah was finally able to stand on her own two 
feet on Monday just before Christmas

Noah
 suffered injuries to his lungs and scrapes and bruises, but DiMartino 
and Gregory both required multiple surgeries and both continue to 
undergo rehabilitation.

Rebekah underwent a staggering 14 surgeries following the blast and told The Knot that her leg still might need to be amputated.

As well as a ruptured eardrum, DiMartino lost 90 per cent of his right Achilles' tendon and suffered broken bones in his ankles and it has taken him months of physical therapy to learn to walk again.

But the couple has leaned on each other for support during their recoveries. One day in October, Rebekah told Pete she needed him. He jumped in his car, with a custom-made ring in his pocket.

'I was having a rough day and I called Pete and told him, "I just need you here right now",' she told The Knot. 'I was in complete shock when I saw Pete. He got down on one knee and before he could even ask, I said, "yes!"'

Happy: They had been dating for a year before their engagement and said the tragedy brought them closer

Hurt: The couple was standing at the marathon finishing line when the bombs detonated last April

She added: 'Being able to show people that you can take something so horrible and turn it into something so beautiful has been such a blessing to us.'

Just before Christmas, a device that 
had been drilled into Rebekah's bone was removed and replaced with a 
cast - allowing her to stand again for the first time since the tragedy.

‘To put two feet on the ground again was the most amazing feeling,’ she told NBC News at the time. ‘And just right before Christmas, too. It’s like, what an amazing present this year.’

But Gregory still has a long way to go, and she has described the moment she put her foot down in the boot as extremely painful.

‘It
 was awful. It was the worst pain all over again,’ she said. ‘Putting it
 on the ground doesn’t feel right and it feels like it’s just crushing 
what bones I have left.’

Her doctors estimated that it would be another six months to a year before she is walking more freely.

She said she is so motivated by the achievement.

‘It
 just hit me: I’ve come such a long way and even though I have such a 
long way to go, I’m so blessed for this journey and to be able to help 
people and inspire people along the way,’ she said.   

The
 couple, who met on a work trip, have been together for a year and said 
they knew before the attacks that they had found the perfect match - but
 agreed the experience brought them even closer.

'Going through an experience like the 
marathon makes you realize how short life really is and how we don't 
really know how much time we have left,' Gregory said.

'And I know that with my time 
there is nobody else I would want to spend it with. It made me 
realize how much I cared about him and how much he was the only person 
for me.'
