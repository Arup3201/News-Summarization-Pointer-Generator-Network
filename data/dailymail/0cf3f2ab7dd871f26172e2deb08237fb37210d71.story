Rory McIlroy is determined to avoid another black Friday after setting The Open alight with a wonderful, pace-setting 66 before a bumper crowd at Royal Liverpool.

The gifted Northern Irishman has thrilled the golfing world this season with a number of brilliant opening rounds, only to undo all the good work the following day.

Clearing the way: Rory McIlroy leads after the first day at the Open Championship

Kicking up dust: McIlroy plays out of a bunker on the 18th hole on day one at Hoylake

‘Hopefully I’m able to turn that 
round,’ said the 25-year-old. ‘It started with a bad Friday afternoon at
 the Masters and the next two events as well. I just have to take one 
hole at a time.

'Any time 
you shoot 66 at the Open Championship, you're going to be pleased: it's 
another great start and I'm looking forward to getting back out there 
tomorrow. Whenever I go out and play on Thursdays there's not really 
many expectations.

'You're going out there and you're trying to find a rhythm and you're just trying to play your way into the round.

'When
 you go back out on Friday after a good score you know what you can do, 
so you're going out with some expectations compared to Thursday.

'I
 just have to take it one hole at a time, one shot at a time - I know 
everyone says it and you've heard it a million times, but it's true.'

Top man: McIlroy topped the leaderboard after the first day at sun-drenched Royal Liverpool

Centre of attention: A camera follows McIlroy along the 14th fairway

In control: McIlroy will hope to continue his form into Friday where conditions are expected to worsen

McIlroy is an aggregate 57 under for first rounds this year nine over for second rounds.

The
 one downside was the number of times the leading players had to back 
off shots because spectators were taking photographs on their phones — 
forcing the Royal and Ancient to appeal to the public last night not to 
take photos.

Inevitably, Tiger Woods was the one who suffered most.

‘People were taking pictures all day and we were backing off shots all the time,’ he said.

Woods still shot a fine 69 in his first round at a major for 11 months following back surgery.  World No 1 Adam Scott shot 68.

Leading home hope Justin Rose, bidding for a third tournament win in a row, shot 72. Ian Poulter and Luke Donald shot 73.

Following behind: Matteo Manassero finished the day one shot behind McIlroy

No repeats: McIlroy will aim to avoid a day two capitulation which came after he last led the Open after the opening day four years ago
