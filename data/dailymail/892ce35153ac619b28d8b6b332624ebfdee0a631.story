Worry: One in three Brits admit leaving appointments with their GP completely baffled by medical jargon, according to research

One in three Brits admit leaving appointments with their GP completely baffled by medical jargon, according to research.

A shocking 31 per cent feel confused, anxious and uneasy after failing to understand what their doctor has told them.

One in ten 18 to 24 year olds (ten per cent) even think a harmless ‘benign’ condition is terminal - causing them to leave the doctor’s in unnecessary fear.

The study shows many others are also misunderstanding their diagnosis.

One in nine Brits (11 per cent) believe a CT scan is a ‘computerised torso scan’, while eight per cent are convinced a haemorrhage is just another word for piles.

The study was carried out by AXA PPP healthcare and highlights the confusion many experience when they see their GP.

In a survey of 2,000 adults, 11 per cent admitted being too embarrassed to ask questions, while ten per cent were reluctant to do so in case they wasted their GP’s time.

Health experts have warned that the embarrassment factor is causing a tidal wave of confusion.

Worryingly, a fifth of us (21 per cent) feel baffled because our doctor doesn’t take enough time to explain things - leaving us feeling rushed during appointments.

Another three per cent of Brits have simply given up and gone to see another doctor.

Dr Gary Bolger, Chief Medical Officer at AXA PPP healthcare said: 'Good communication is a two-way process.

1. CT scan - computerised tomography scan (57 per cent do not know this)

2. Ganglion - a harmless cyst (55 per cent)

3. Somnambulism - sleepwalking (49 per cent)

4. Hypertension - high blood pressure (41 per cent)

5. MRI scan - magnetic resonance imaging (35 per cent)

6. Fracture - broken bone (23 per cent)

7. Benign - not harmful in effect (21 per cent)

8. Haemorrhage - an escape of blood from a ruptured blood vessel (19 per cent)

'It is important for GPs to remember that a sizeable minority of their patients may not have sufficient knowledge or understanding to take in what they’re saying.

'While some patients can find it intimidating to question their GP when they don’t understand what they’ve said, patients should remember their doctor is there to help them.

'They shouldn’t be afraid or embarrassed to ask their doctor to explain what they mean.'

When it comes to knowledge of medical terms, the study discovered younger generations are less well informed.

Only 63 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds correctly identified a fracture as a broken bone - compared with 91 per cent of those aged over 55.

Worryingly, five per cent actually thought it referred to a torn muscle.

Another 52 per cent of young adults correctly identified hypertension as high blood pressure - compared to the 69 per cent of older respondents.

Nearly a fifth (17 per cent) thought MRI stood for multiple radiation investigation, while nine per cent opted for mass radiation inventory.

Hypertension was mistakenly defined by six per cent of Brits as a hyperactive disorder, while 12 per cent believed a diagnosis of sleepwalking was a type of ear infection.
