His fist-pumping 'Ronny Roar' celebration has become a big noise in recent weeks, but the Celtic manager admits he would like to hear his defenders turn up the volume as they prepare to face Inter Milan in the San Siro this week.

The sight of Ronny Deila making his way to the club's support and whipping the fans into a ferment has added colour to the Scottish football season but, while the boss may ooze flamboyant charisma, he admits his team is short of like-minded rabble-rousers.

Out with the warrior-like presence of his captain Scott Brown and, when he is in the team, the ebullience of on-loan striker John Guidetti, Deila admits his team lacks natural leaders, the sort of men who use words to spark their colleagues into action.

The silent treatment may suffice when facing the routine Premiership opposition but, step up a level or two to the Europea League, and the Norwegian reckons he could be doing with a lot more communication among his defenders.

His two full-backs, Adam Matthews and Emilio Izaguirre, may like to attack with a certain flamboyance but are among the most reticent footballers you could ever meet. At 19, Jason Denayer has the makings of a quality centre-half but has yet to find his voice.

Even Virgil van Dijk, a man not short on belief in his own abilities, has had to be coaxed out of his shell by the club's coaching staff.

Goalkeeper Craig Gordon, meanwhile, asserts his authority by exuding a Zen-like calm.

Two rare errors from Gordon may offer a partial explanation for the first-leg 3-3 scoreline from three nights ago but Deila would also like the men in front of him to assert themselves better. He knows his team must score at least once in Italy to have any hope of progressing to the last 16 but a clean sheet would do just as much to help.

The portents are not good — Celtic have shipped an eye-watering 23 goals in 13 European matches this season and the prospects of finding a way to plug all the gaps between now and Thursday appear slim.

That won't stop Deila trying. Organisation will be key on the Nerazzurri's home patch and that's likely to be a central theme in training this week.

'I think we can keep a clean sheet but we have to cut out the easy mistakes and improve the communication in the team, especially at the back,' said Deila. 'Everything is possible. It will be a great achievement if we go through and beat them in Milan, but the players have to talk more.

'I think they need matches like this, that's important. Our central defenders are both young and very talented and there's a lot of attention on them when they play these games. They have to deal with that.

'There are 20 clubs coming to watch them. So it's mentally tough, especially for young players.

'We have to bring it out of them. We have Broony who talks with the players around him but it's very important to get experience into that central spine of the team. It's also something to look for when we're bringing in players — a leadership style.

'Craig speaks a lot with his body — he's very calm and reads situations very well but he could also be more vocal. Virgil has stepped up in that way, he's much better than he has been, but he's still young. So to have an experienced central defender could be a good thing.'

Having held on to van Dijk in the face of interest from English clubs, including Southampton and Sunderland, it seems likely that Celtic will cash in on the Dutch international hopeful at the end of the season.

Deila has repeatedly gone on record with his desire to extend Denayer's loan transfer from Manchester City into a second season but the Belgian has been less willing to talk up the chances of another year at Parkhead.

If Deila does indeed find himself in the market for a centre-half with an old head and an active tongue, it won't be through choice.

'If I had to choose, I would not bring anybody in,' he insisted. 'I'd stick with the two I have because they have the future in front of them.'

That Deila is talking about communication is instructive. Six months ago, the Norwegian had the more fundamental issue of fitness on his mind as his players struggled to adopt the high-tempo pressing game he had deployed at his previous club Stromsgodset.

In the first leg against Inter, Deila's team was unrecognisable from the group that laboured against Legia Warsaw and, to a lesser extent, Maribor in the Champions League qualifiers.

'We looked fit,' he agreed. 'We kept at Inter for 90 minutes, pushed them backwards and could keep them under pressure for good periods.

'We were not able to do that six months ago.

'I think we saw that against Legia Warsaw — the team couldn't cope with it and lost the game big time. So we are taking steps all the time, showing that everything is possible.

'We scored three goals against an Italian team, a Roberto Mancini team, so it's a good performance. The sad part is we gave away two easy goals.

'We have to defend more in Italy but also we have to vary our pressure. The key is to stay compact for 90 minutes because you know they have players who can exploit your mistakes quickly.'

Although Inter have been displaying shaky form domestically, the concession of three goals in Glasgow on Thursday was an anomaly — in the previous eight European ties played this season, Mancini's defence had been breached only twice.

The thrust of Matthews down the right flank was instrumental in unsettling Inter, with the full-back showing drive and then composure to square the ball for Stuart Armstrong and kick-start the comeback from 2-0 down.

Armstrong and his old Dundee United pal Gary Mackay-Steven were both excellent on their home debuts for the club and they have added extra pace to the mix.

'I think we have a lot of speed in the team now and players who can do something,' said Deila. 'The relationships in the side are better, so we create things from the sides.'

The end of the match brought Deila on to the pitch but there was to be none of his trademark theatrics, just a few waves of gratitude at the part played by the crowd on a memorable night.

While accepting that a 0-0 scoreline might statistically have given his team a better chance in the return leg, you suspect he wouldn't have changed a thing about the emotionally-charged match that ended on the crescendo caused by Guidetti's stoppage-time equaliser.

'For me, football is about entertainment, we have to entertain the fans and also get results,' he added. 'The Celtic fans are intelligent, they have seen so much football and they know what they like.

'They were happy because we gave everything and also because we tried to create and attack.

'You have to believe in a style but I'm not doing this for romance, I'm doing this to get results and I believe we can do it.'
