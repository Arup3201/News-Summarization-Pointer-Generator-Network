Control underwear is the secret weapon of women the world over. And few brands have had caused as much of a storm as Spanx.

Loved by celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Katherine Heigl, Jennifer Garner and Julia Roberts, as well as the less famous (and less toned) among us, Spanx has fast become the biggest name in shapewear across the globe. But with prices of £34 for a pair of Power Panties shorts or £109 for a slip, prices for the mainline Spanx range can be prohibitive.

Now that is set to change as Spanx launches an offshoot collection in the UK in an attempt to make the brand accessible to a wider market.

Assets Red Hot Label, launching exclusively into Debenhams, is priced from £29, with no item costnig more than £62.

Initially launched in America in 2006 where it was met with huge success, the fashion-inspired silhouettes and design details make concealing imperfections more affordable.

The brand say that the new range is more suited to a younger market, with lower price points, altered structures and shorter lengths offering support for the mini dress and bodycon trends.

Sleek Slimmers slip £52, which can even be worn as outerwear, and the Cheeky Control Tummy Tamer, £29

Pieces are designed to go with every outfit and styles can be flipped inside out for a new colour or turned around to offer a second neckline option.

The range features light slips, shapers with lace and slimming tops as well as the full body shapers and the favourite high-waisted pants.

The collection is available in three levels of so-called 'power', depending on the wearer's needs: Medium for subtle slimming and smoothing, Super for a high level of slimming and shaping, and Ultra for what the brand say is 'targeted taming and maximum control'.

While the Medium range is made of a lightweight fabric for ‘comfortable firming’, the Ultra level unsurprisingly is made of what are called 'super powerful yarns’ that they claim will combat trouble zones.

The most expensive piece in the range is the full-body open-bust bodyshaper costing £62.

The cheapest piece in the range is the tummy tamer brief, £29, which features a slimming waistband that flattens the tummy.

Celebrities like Kim Kardashian (left) and Julia Roberts have openly spoken about their love for Spanx

Spanx founder Sara Blakely comments: 'We launched the Assets brand to help more women experience the power of shapewear.

'Women in the UK will love Assets' for its value, but also for its comfortable results. Now with Assets Red Hot Label, we’re giving women even more ways to look and feel their absolute best in their clothes.'

The Red Hot Label range went on sale this week at Debenhams.
