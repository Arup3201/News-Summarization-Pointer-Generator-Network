Have you ever booked that 'executive junior suite' at a hotel, only to arrive to find a broom cupboard with a view of an air conditioning unit?

According to new research, 48 per cent of Britons have had to request to move after check-in when discovering the room is a far cry from what they saw on the website.

Responding to poll results that suggest that one in five British travellers admit their holiday has been ruined by anxiety over whether to 'suffer in silence' or getting up the nerve to complain, Thistle Hotels have come up with a solution.

Choose Your Own Room: Thistle hotel has launched a service allowing guests to select where they stay

The chain's Euston hotel in London has just launched a free 'Choose Your Own Room' online service.

With 88 per cent of Britons saying they'd prefer to select what room they stay in,Thistle's solution to 'room anxiety' allows guests to take a 360° virtual tour of their selected room when booking.

Much like pre-selecting your seat on a plane, travellers can view photographs of a specific room prior to checking in, including the view, and make a change if it doesn't meet their needs.

Reality: ... only to arrive to find this?

Four in ten of those polled admit to feeling anxious about their hotel room before arriving, fearing it won't be what they paid for, while nearly a third have quietly requested to be given rooms away from work colleagues on business trips.

The 'Choose Your Own Room' service aims to prevent any awkwardness for customers in such circumstances.

David Grosfils, Chief Operating Officer from Thistle Hotels, says: ‘We know Brits hate to complain, so concerns about causing a fuss if we don’t like the room we’re allocated really can spoil a stay for many. 

Innovative: Thistle's London Euston hotel is allowing guests to preview specific rooms before booking

'Guests often opt to stay in the same bedroom if they’ve stayed with us before, so we’re simply putting them in control by inviting guests who book direct on thistle.com to use the ‘Choose Your Own Room’ service. 

'Our ambition is that all Thistle hotels across the UK will have the CYOR service and we are working on rolling this out now.’

'Don't want to cause a fuss': With Brits known for avoiding complaints, the service prevents awkward conversations with reception staff

Behavioural Psychologist Jo Hemmings added: ‘Complaining really isn’t in our national psyche so the anticipation of not liking our room, or even worse, it not meeting our partner’s expectations really can make Britons feel anxious and out of control – particularly when they are outside familiar surroundings and away from home. 

'Airlines have long put us in control before check in by letting us choose our own seats, so if we are staying the night somewhere, a system where travellers can really visualise where they’ll be waking up is a big move forward which should help combat first night nerves and help many relax into their trip without being worried about a row.’
