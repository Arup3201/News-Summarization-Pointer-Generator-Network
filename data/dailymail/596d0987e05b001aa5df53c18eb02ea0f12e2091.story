A flamboyant Congressman who spent $40,000 of taxpayers' money redecorating his office in the style of 'Downton Abbey' and spent thousands more taking a private jet to watch a sporting event resigned on Tuesday.

Aaron Schock, a Republican from Illinois, had faced fresh questions over 170,000 miles he claimed he had driven in a car which he sold with only 80,000 miles on the odometer.

He had already been in the spotlight over a series of expense claims. Along with the makeover, he billed $10,000 for a private jet trip to watch the Chicago Bears play football.

'Today, I am announcing my resignation as a Member of the United States House of Representatives effective March 31,' Schock, 33, said in a statement issued by his Capitol Hill office.

'I do this with a heavy heart. Serving the people of the 18th District is the highest and greatest honor I have had in my life. I thank them for their faith in electing me and letting me represent their interests in Washington.' 

But 'the constant questions over the last six weeks,' he admitted, 'have proven a great distraction that has made it too difficult for me to serve the people of the 18th District with the high standards that they deserve and which I have set for myself.'

It was a dramatic turn from just last month when he flippantly responded to complaints about his lavish office redecoration.

'Haters gonna hate,' he replied then.

Schock gained a reputation as a walking lifestyle magazine, attending entertainment awards show and giving interviews about his buff physique.

In November he posted a selfie on Instagram that he snapped with 21-year-old singer Ariana Grande before the American Music Awards.

Other Instagram snaps in his timeline show him mugging with Pope Francis, Apple Computer CEO Tim Cook, Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler, the country music band Lady Antebellum, and legendary cellist Yo-Yo Ma.

Several other social media pictures show him speaking to reporters in his home district from behind a podium that cost $5,123 from his official ofice budget in 2009.

According to Buzzfeed, the podium is a close facsimile of the one President Obama uses, complete with a circular seal – in this case, one that reads 'United States House of Representatives.' 

Politico was first to report Schock's resignation; his now-former district is centered on the small Illinois city of Peoria.

The paper had earlier reported that he was facing new questions over his expenses: Schock had submitted claims for 170,000 miles he said he drove on Congressional business in his Chevy Tahoe.

But the car, which he bought new, had just 80,000 miles on its odometer when it was sold.

Schock's troubles also included accusations that he had hired a personal photographer to follow him around. He also chartered private planes and stayed in five-star hotels.

He also allegedly sold his home to a donor who had built and financed it – receiving more than the property was worth.

And National Journal reported last week that an outside group paid for a Schock companion, Shea Ledford, to travel to India.

Schock's air charters included one jaunt with staffers to a Katy Perry concert, and another in 2014 that saw him bring an entourage of 20 to New York where they reportedly did little work but saw a star-studded 'Global Citizen Festival' concert.

That journey set taxpayers back $10,000; Schock justified it as a 'very legitimate trip' by noting that it coincided with a U.S. visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 

The festival and concert that were underwritten in part by the Peoria-based Caterpillar company. 

Salon reported in February that Schock had accepted a string of lavish gifts and meals in London, and hosted a September 2014 fundraiser at a Maryland golf course – 'The Aaron Schock Golf Classic' – which netted his political coffers $125,000.

But his official financial disclosure documents showed no signs of the perks. 

Another visit to the UK saw Schock taking Ledford to several high-society meals hosted by the Prince of Wales Foundation in June 2011.

Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, attended one of them. The events were hosted at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and a posh London nightclub.

At the time a foundation spokeswoman told Politico that Schock had been 'a guest of a guest of the Prince of Wales, so he has no involvement with the foundation and therefore wasn’t in any way, shape or form involved other than attending a dinner as a guest of a guest.'

Separately, Schock declared on a political campaign disclosure document that he had spent money on software purchases. The expense turned out to be for a private jet trip on an aircraft owned by a software company president. 

Congressional rules prohibit members from accepting any a gift worth more than $50. That includes food and beverages.

The guidelines provide an exception for gifts from close personal friends, but even those require written approval from the House Ethics Committee – and later public disclosure – if they exceed $250.

The Associated Press confirmed Monday that the Office of Congressional Ethics was investigating Schock's high-flying lifestyle while in office. 

The OCE is an outside panel that reviews ethics complaints against House members and makes recommendations to the ethics committee, which is composed of equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats.

That committee, however, has no authority to investigate ethics-challenged lawmakers after they quit. 

In a statement, House Speaker John Boehner said: 'With this decision, Rep. Schock has put the best interests of his constituents and the House first. I appreciate Aaron's years of service, and I wish him well in the future.'

A source in House leadership told Daily Mail Online that Schock did not give anyone notice before making his announcement.

'We were all caught by surprise,' the congressional aide said Tuesday. 'It's a long time coming, but we had no idea it would happen today.'

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group, pounced a few hours after Schock's announcement.

Anne Weismann, the group's executive director,called Schock's departure 'inevitable,' noting that he 'couldn’t say just last week whether or not he had broken the law.'

Her group has separately filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which can continue to investigate.

Schock is the second Republican member of the House of Representatives to quit in recent months under a cloud of scandal.

Former New York Rep. Michael Grimm resigned his House seat after he agreed to plead guilty to federal tax evasion. The first order of busniess in the 114th Congress was to announce his departure.

Illinois will hold a special election in the next 115 days to replace Schock in his district, according to state law. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner must announce a date within five days.

Schock was first elected in 2009, succeeding Ray LaHood – who went on to be President Obama's transportation secretary. Voters re-elected Schock in 2012 with an overwhelming 74 percent of the vote.
