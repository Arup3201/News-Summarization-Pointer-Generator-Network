Luis Enrique changed his Barcelona line-up for the 28th time in a row, dropping Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, but this time nobody was complaining as they racked up a big victory to ease through to the Copa del Rey quarter-finals.

The Asturian coach put out an entirely different side to the team that saw off Atletico Madrid last weekend and the reserves responded impressively, to offer Diego Simeone's side the chance of revenge in the next round.

Two brilliant first half goals from Jeremy Mathieu and Sergi Roberto set Barcelona on their way, before Pedro and Adriano added two more, and their team did the footballing equivalent of putting their feet up and having a doze in front of the fire, gently stirred by the odd Elche effort whizzing over the crossbar.

Enrique had given his fearsome strike-force the night off, with only two regular starters in the squad - Gerard Pique and Ivan Rakitic on the bench. The likes of Javier Mascherano, Sergio Busquets, Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta were also saved from making the 330-mile trip down the coast to the small city of Elx.

Barcelona were, of course, five goals up from the first leg, so if they had managed to get eliminated it wouldn't just have been Messi and a few worried fans wanting to see the back of the coach.

One thing you can't accuse Enrique of is ignoring the youth, with Gerard Gumbau and Alen Halilovic making their debuts here, the latter the seventh youngster Enrique has bestowed the honour upon in his short time at the club.

Instead of the stars, we got to see a few of the starlets, with Adama Traore dazzling in fits and starts on the wing, and midfielder Gerard Gumbau and forward Munir El Haddadi also starting. Although the latter had plenty of game-time earlier in the season, it's dried up of late as Barcelona's main strikers have started to click.

Adriano should have opened the scoring after seven minutes, with right-back Martin Montoya heading the ball down to the left-back, just a few yards out, but he fluffed his lines. The Brazilian is more accustomed to scoring screamers from long-distance, so he probably wasn't used to being in such a position. That excuse was scuppered a few minutes later, when he launched a rocket from thirty yards, which lurched off into the stands.

Mario Pasalic, on loan at Elche from Chelsea, showed he wasn't afraid to put his foot in, with an early foul on Rafinha Alcantara to break up Barcelona's play. He hasn't been a consistent starter for Elche this season, but he's put in some reasonable displays.

After 20 minutes Adama zipped down the right and the cumbersome Edu Albacar hacked him down. The veteran defender was lucky that he didn't see red, but Elche were punished, brutally, by Mathieu.

The Frenchman hasn't picked up many accolades for his grace or accuracy on the field, but there was nothing wrong with his searing 30-yard free kick which fizzed into the top right corner.

Elche weren't too pleased and decided to copy Atletico Madrid's tactics from last Sunday night, which saw Diego Simeone's side try to kick Barcelona to pieces. Just like in that game, it didn't work, and the Blaugrana scored another brilliant goal after 40 minutes.

Martin Montoya laid the ball across to Sergi Roberto, around 25-yards out, and he shifted it onto his left foot and then swerved it magnificently into the top left corner, leaving poor Manu Herrera with no chance.

And before long, it was three. The beleaguered Albacar knocked down Munir in the box and a penalty was awarded. Pedro, another victim of the Messi-Neymar-Suarez triumvirate, was given the captain's armband for the first time in his Barcelona career, and also the responsibility for converting the spot-kick. He did, stroking it into the bottom left corner, sending Herrera the wrong way.

Adama continued to impress with his trickery on the wing in the second half, with an impressive blend of speed, power and skill. Albacar, meanwhile, started to make amends for his poor defensive work, whipping in a brilliant ball which was missed by Coro at the back post, with Ter Stegen's goal gaping.

Adriano got his goal in the end, nodding home from a Douglas cross in stoppage time to make it 4-0 on the night and an astonishing 9-0 on aggregate. Including Barcelona's previous games against Huesca, they have scored 21 goals in the last two rounds of the competition.

Pulling the strings for Barcelona throughout was Rafinha, who may be the eventual heir to Xavi's throne. There's the danger that he'll be seen as an Enrique man, but he's shown enough in the games so far this season to suggest he will eventually thrive at the top level.

And in the years ahead, we'll be hearing more about Halilovic too. The young Croatian replaced Adama - wearing the No 30, the same Messi did when he made his debut - and hit the post with an almost carbon copy of Sergi Roberto's shot for the second goal.

But however impressive the youth players were at the Estadio Martinez Valero, it will be all change when Barcelona head to the Riazor on Sunday night to face Deportivo la Coruna. Back will come Messi, Neymar and Suarez. And back will come the pressure, as they try to hound down Real Madrid at La Liga's summit.
