A man charged with killing three adults and a toddler on an eastern Kansas farm made a brief appearance in a packed courtroom Monday, but showed little emotion while a judge set a new court date.

Kyle Flack, 27, has been held on $10 million bond in the Franklin County jail since he was charged Friday with capital murder in the deaths of 18-month-old Lana Leigh Bailey; her mother, Kaylie Bailey, 21; and Andrew Stout, 30. Flack is also charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder in those deaths, as well as that of Steven White, 31.

The adults' bodies were found early last week at an Ottawa area farm home. A body believed to be the toddler's was found Saturday in nearby Osage County.

Shackled: Flack was picked up for questioning about 50 miles from where Kaylie Bailey was found

Flack was picked up for questioning last week about 50 miles southwest of Ottawa in Emporia, where officers also found the car that Kaylie Bailey had been driving when she was last seen. She and her child were reported missing from Olathe on May 3.

In court Monday, four armed officers stood between Flack and the small courtroom, which was overflowing with family and friends of the victims.

Flack was shackled at the wrists and ankles, and appeared with his lawyer, Ronald Evans. He waived having an initial preliminary hearing set in 15 days, and Judge Thomas Sachse set it for July 8 instead.

Evans declined additional comment after the hearing.

Authorities said in the complaint filed Friday against Flack that a firearm was used in the four deaths.

Franklin County Attorney Stephen Hunting, however, has declined to say if the four had been shot. Authorities haven't said what the motive for the killings may have been.

Sheriff Jeff Richards, who also attended the hearing, said afterward that forensic work was continuing on what authorities believed to be the child's remains.

Andrew Helm, 27, of Gardner, was a friend of the victims' and was one of Flack's co-workers at the Ottawa Sanitation Department a couple years ago. Helm said he attended the hearing to support Stout's family.

Helm said Stout, Flack, Bailey and her daughter attended a barbecue at Helm's home on April 28 and that he noticed nothing unusual.

The criminal complaint filed in the case said Lana and Kaylie Bailey and Stout were killed 'on or about or between' April 28 to May 6, and that White was killed 'on or about or between' April 20 and April 28.

Vicki Engstrom, of Ottawa, said she was a longtime friend of Stout's family and attended Flack's hearing so she 'could see his expression.'

'I didn't see any remorse in him at all,' she said.

Earlier, when the body of Lana was recovered, officials said the investigation would continue.

'I want the family of Lana, and all the victims, to know that this investigation will continue until we are confident we have collected as much evidence as we can to ensure justice is served on behalf of all four victims,' Franklin County Sheriff Jeff Richards said Sunday.

Richards said the body was discovered by an Osage County sheriff's deputy who was searching an area for items that could be connected to the deaths reported May 6 at a farm home in nearby Franklin County.

The evidence collected Saturday when the body was recovered led investigators to believe it was the infant's body, his statement said without elaboration.

'We hope that a forensic examination will make a final identification,' Richards added. 'Until the identity is confirmed investigators will continue following up on all tips, leads and information connected to this crime.'

Major search: At times up to 150 police used dive teams, police dogs, mounted patrols, planes, boats and all-terrain vehicles to scour fields, farms, ponds and creeks between Ottawa and Emporia, Kansas looking for the girl

The statement did not provide any details of where the body was discovered or how the infant had died. But his statement said a crime scene unit was called to the area 'to process this new crime scene.'

'It is not the outcome we'd hoped for but we knew we couldn't stop searching until Lana was home,' the statement said.

Richards told The AP by telephone early on Sunday that he would not have any further details beyond the statement. The Franklin County sheriff's office said its next scheduled statement on the investigation would be Sunday afternoon.

On Saturday, search crews had deployed using boats and sonar equipment in search of the child. Earlier authorities had said investigators were scouring ponds and other waterways in the area looking for the body of Lana Leigh Bailey.

Kyle Flack was charged Friday with capital murder as officials investigated the deaths of Lana Bailey's 21-year-old mother, Kaylie Bailey, and 30-year-old Andrew Stout. The 27-year-old convicted felon also was charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder in those deaths as well as that of 31-year-old Steven White, authorities have said.

The investigation had included searching the farm and other rural areas in the 50-mile stretch between Ottawa and Emporia, where Kaylie Bailey's car was found Tuesday.

Franklin County Attorney Stephen Hunting said Friday that a firearm was used against the victims at the farm, but didn't elaborate on whether that meant they were fatally shot.

Authorities have not commented on a motive.

Richards said earlier that the extensive investigation of what he called a 'horrific crime' had taken a toll and that members of the investigative team have required medical attention after searching in difficult areas. Others sought counsel from a chaplain.
