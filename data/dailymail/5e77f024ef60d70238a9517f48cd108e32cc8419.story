Crazy, stupid love: Alicia Walicke stole a bottle of $3.99 wine so she could see her boyfriend in jail

A Texas woman drunk on love allegedly stole a bottle of $3.99 wine - so she could get arrested and see her boyfriend in jail.

Alicia Walicke, 22, of Cedar Park, was charged with misdemeanor theft after stealing a bottle Mad Dog 20/20 from a Shell petrol station, before sitting in the forecourt and drinking it while waiting for the police to show up.

When they got there, she told them that her boyfriend had been arrested hours earlier, and she wanted to go to jail so she could see him.

The arrest warrant, obtained by the Austin American-Statesman, said: 'Her boyfriend was arrested earlier that evening and it was her fault, so she wanted to make things right and go to jail.' 

Walicke was taken to Williamson County Jail, and released on bail after paying a $5,000 bond. 

Police in Cedar Park, 15 miles north west of Austin, did not immediately identify the boyfriend or say whether the woman saw him.

Mad Dog 20/20 is the slang term for a flavoured, fortified wine made by Mogen David, and is described by the Urban Dictionary as being 'as majestic as the cascading waters of a drain pipe.'

The incident echoes other stupid thefts, such as one in 2012, when Houaka Yang, from La Crosse, Wisconsin, stole a camera which he then used to film a video introducing himself and admitting he took the item.

Yang stole the camera from the car of Republican state Senate candidate Bill Feehan. When police recovered it and returned it to its owner Chris Rochester, who worked for Feehan, he discovered the bizarre message, which also included a tour of the man's house, and uploaded it to YouTube.

'This is my house, yes, and a stolen camera that I stole. But it's OK, the cop won't figure it out,' Yang embarrassingly predicts in the clip.
