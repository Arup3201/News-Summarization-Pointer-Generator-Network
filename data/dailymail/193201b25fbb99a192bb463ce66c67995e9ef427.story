A Budget black hole of £23billion could lead to future tax rises of £480 for every family after the general election.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the next government will have to find the money in the two years after the election if it is to get public finances back on track.

If ministers keep cutting spending at the current rate, £9billion of tax rises would be necessary in 2016/17 – the equivalent of an increase of 3p on the basic rate of income tax.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned George Osborne's plans require up to £12.3billion to be found, equivalent to a £480 tax hike for every household

The savings will have to be made because of deterioration in the state of the public finances after growth predictions were slashed in half.

But this week’s Budget also slapped £3.5billion of extra costs on government departments who will have to pay higher National Insurance contributions as a result of reforms to pensions.

That will raise the likely tax hit to £12.5billion.

The Treasury claims the Government would like to make austerity savings using spending cuts alone. But that would mean Whitehall departments enduring unprecedented cuts of 18 per cent by 2017/18.

And the Budget ‘Red Book’, which spells out all the Chancellor’s budget measures, actually reveals that officials are already considering tax rises.

George Osborne announced the spending review planned for this summer will have to find another £11.5billion in cuts for 2015-16.

The
Treasury refused to say where the axe will fall, but the IPPR think 
tank said calculated that with £8.5billion coming from departments, if 
it was spread evenly the reductions would be:

Nick
Pearce, IPPR Director, said: 'If these cuts go ahead, it means a major 
further reductions in spending on housing, further and higher education,
early years and other local government services.'

‘It would, of course, be possible to do more of this further consolidation through tax instead,’ the document says.

IFS director, Paul Johnson, said that suggests tax rises are on the cards after the next election, whoever wins in 2015.

He said: ‘It seems extremely hard to imagine we will really achieve an additional £23 billion of spending cuts by 2017/18.

As the Red Book almost acknowledges, it seems likely there will be some significant tax increases to offset some of those cuts.’

The IFS called the state of the public finances ‘desperately disappointing’, with the Chancellor due to borrow £70billion more in 2014/15 than he had originally hoped.

Mr Johnson warned that the poor state of the public finances also means a ‘grim’ future for departments whose budgets will not be protected.

The Government has ringfenced spending in the NHS, international aid and schools.

Mr Johnson said: ‘Add to that the fact that we are promised more capital spending, more spending on social care and a more generous childcare subsidy, within an overall spending envelope that has not been expanded, and the outlook for all other unprotected spending looks grim indeed.’ 

The warning came as the Institute for Public Policy Research, a centre left think tank, warned that belt-tightening is set to hit the Armed Forces hard.

The Coalition’s spending review, which will draw up budgets for 2015/16 over the next few months, looks set to demand cuts of £1.65billion from the Ministry of Defence.

Local government also faces a £1.5billion cut, with £930 being slashed from the Department of Business budget, £850million from the non-schools parts of the education budget, £500million from the Home Office and £460million slashed from the Ministry of Justice.

That will annoy senior members of the Cabinet – Home Secretary Theresa May, Business Secretary Vince Cable, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles – who have been dubbed the National Union of Ministers for protesting that they can’t make more cuts.

Awkward: George Osborne bumped into his Labour rival Ed Balls outside TV studios in Westminster as they both took to the airwaves to give their take on the Budget

A defiant Mr Osborne said he would make no apology for cutting spending yesterday after he was accused of ‘massaging’ the figures on borrowing to score a political point.

The IFS said his manipulation of the borrowing figures could lead to ‘real economic costs’.

Labour also seized on revelations that £2.2billion was trimmed from the NHS budget at the last minute –money which could have been spent on frontline care or hiring nurses.

Which party do you trust with the economy?

George Osborne has declared he is in competition with shadow chancellor Ed Balls over who can get the most followers on Twitter.

A day after joining the site, using the Twitter handle @George-Osborne, the Chancellor had racked up 33,400 followers despite sending just three tweets.

Balls has sent more than 3,000 tweets and has 77,500 followers.

‘We're in a competition now,’ Mr Osborne told ITV1's Daybreak this morning.

Making his debut on Twitter yesterday he was deluged with advice - and abuse.

It included missives such as: ‘learn to punctuate correctly you risible t**t’.

Another example of taunting was: ‘You’re a first class b*****d, you overpaid, overeducated fox hunting t**t.’

Mr Osborne admitted: 'It's a fast and furious world out there.’

But Mr Osborne rejected the criticism, saying he was proud to have got spending under control.

‘We have been very, very tough and we have reduced spending in order to reduce borrowing,’ he said.

‘So if the charge is, you stepped in to stop government spending too much at the end of the financial year, that’s right.’

The problem arose in February when Mr Osborne was warned by the Office of Budget Responsibility that income tax receipts were £5.1billion lower than expected.

That triggered a period of frantic horse-trading in which the Treasury leaned on other departments to underspend their budgets.

Figures, never published before, showed that £3billion was also found from the Defence budget and £900million from Transport.

Other money was saved by delaying payments to bodies like the World Bank and the European Union.

The exercise opened up Mr Osborne to the charge that he has fiddled the figures, using the kind of accounting tricks for which Gordon Brown was once notorious.

The IFS was damning about that exercise, effectively accusing ministers of wastefully manipulating spending plans for political ends.

There was a rare piece of good news for the economy yesterday as figures showed a fall in government borrowing, a rise in High Street sales and growing business confidence.

It came a day after official growth forecasts for 2013 were slashed in half to 0.6 per cent.

The Government borrowed £2.8billion last month – £9billion less than in February last year.

Retail sales jumped 2.1 per cent last month, the biggest rise since March last year. 

And a CBI survey showed British manufacturers at their most confident for a year.
