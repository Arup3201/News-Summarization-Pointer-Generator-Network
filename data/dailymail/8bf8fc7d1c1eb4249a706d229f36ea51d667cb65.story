Samir Nasri says Manchester City showed Barcelona too much respect last season and warned that they will not make the same mistake again.

The French midfielder, speaking ahead of Tuesday night's Champions League last 16 first leg at the Etihad, admitted that Manuel Pellegrini's side let themselves down a year ago when they crashed out 4-1 to the Catalan giants at the same stage.

'I think we respected them too much,' he said. 'But last year we did not have enough experience to deal with a club like this. They know how to win Champions League.

Manchester City will host Barcelona in the Champions League's round of 16 on Tuesday night 

City won their last Premier League game 5-0 against Newcastle United which will give them confidence 

'For us it was first time we went through the Group Stages, I think it was too much of a big game for us. I think this year is different. We know what we are capable of. We are not going to be scared.'

Much has been made of an apparent lack of appetite for the competition among City fans.

Nasri agreed, and called on his teammates to 'make history'.

'I think so because we had a lot of success in the Premier League in the past year so the fans are really passionate,' he said. 'We need to create our history to have this special relationship with the fans. I think Barcelona can be a big step between us and the fans in the competition.'

Nasri added that City were not using revenge for last year's exit as motivation.

'We want to beat Barcelona because we want to go as far as possible, not because of revenge,' he said. 'For us it's a different game. We are better physically than last year. 

'Last year we had a couple of players injured. It's just a matter of winning the game.'

City will be without the suspended Yaya Toure for the clash although manager Manuel Pellegrini revealed that James Milner, who missed Saturday's 5-0 thumping of Newcastle, is fit.

Nasri also defended Luis Suarez, the £75m Barcelona signing who has not repeated his Liverpool scoring exploits at the Nou Camp.

'I think it is different,' he said. 'At Liverpool, he was the main striker. You are not going to score 70 goals. He makes a lot assists and opens up space for (Lionel) Messi and Neymar. He is good, he just doesn’t score as much. 

'At Liverpool, the team was built around him. At Barcelona you cannot do that when you have Messi at his prime. When you arrive at a big club you have to deal with things like that.'

Nasri also spoke of his admiration for Messi, who he put on another level to all except Real Madrid star Ronaldo.

'I think Messi and Ronaldo play in their own galaxy,' he said.

'They compete with each other. The rest, Suarez and Neymar are the same level as Sergio. Sergio when he is fit can lift the team and score goals.'
