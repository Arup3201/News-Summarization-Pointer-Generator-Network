Brutal end: The autopsy report on Carina Saunders revealed the young woman's suffering before she died in Oklahoma

The sickening details of a teenage girl's tortured death have been revealed in the autopsy report.

Carina Saunders' dismembered body was found stuffed in a duffel bag and dumped behind a grocery store in Bethany, Oklahoma, on October 13 last year.

The report, released on Wednesday, said the 19-year-old had a 'violent death' with someone trying to cut out a tattoo on her upper back so her body could not be identified.

She was decapitated and her hands and
feet were missing - although it was unclear whether her body parts were
sawn off before she had died.

The medical examiner had withheld details of the 19-year-old's death so that police could build a murder case.

It
was believed she was killed 
by a human and drug trafficking gang to intimidate female witnesses so they would
cooperate with the gang's demands.

Jimmy Massey, 34, and Luis Ruiz, 37, were charged with the first-degree murder of the young woman from Mustang on July 23.

The two men were being held in the Oklahoma County Jail without bail.

Ruiz is a former elementary school teacher, according to his family, who later became deeply involved in the drug trade.

The
autopsy report revealed that Miss Saunders' decomposing body had to be 
identified by dental records. Her tattoo, which read 'Kween Spade', 
could also be made out on her back.

There is speculation that the tattoo is adopted by white women who like to advertise themselves for sexual relationships with black men. The tattoo is also taken by music fans of bands of the same name and has references in mythology.Â 

'The body parts were wrapped with plastic wrap, a laundry bag and a duffel bag,' states the report, according to Newsok.

There was prescription painkiller tramadol in the 19-year-old's system but the quantity was unclear.

A witness told police last month that one of the men charged with Miss Saunder's murder 
beat her, tied her to a table and tortured her by sawing off her left 
foot.

The suspect then tried to cut off the 19-year-old's right foot before the saw broke, it was claimed.

According to a probable cause 
affidavit filed in Oklahoma County District Court, Ruiz planned and 
carried out the torture killing.

In the affidavit, a woman named 
Michelle Hanshaw told police she went to a house in the city with 
Saunders and witnessed Ruiz 'physically beat Carina Saunders and then 
tie her up'.

Ruiz then 
dragged Saunders to an upstairs room and tied her to a small table with 
rope and twine before using the saw on her feet, Hanshaw told Bethany 
police investigators.

Hanshaw 'jumped out a window to escape' after witnessing the killing.

Stephanie Howard, Ruiz's girlfriend 
in October 2011, told investigators that on two occasions she and Ruiz 
had to 'babysit' a girl Howard later learned was Carina Saunders, 
police reported.

Ruiz said Saunders was going to be 'dealt with', Howard told investigators.

The relationship between Saunders and the two men who are believed to have murdered her, has not been revealed.

Another woman was at the house with 
Saunders and Hanshaw, but left soon after, police reported.

Tia Downour 
said she had been told there was a video of the homicide on the phone, 
and the phone belonged to Ruiz.

Downour told investigators she shared
a room at the Bel-Aire Hotel with Ruiz in May, and when he went to the 
bathroom, she viewed the video, police reported.

'Downour said she watched for a few 
seconds until Saunders began to scream,' Bethany police Lt. JR Jencks 
wrote in the affidavit, adding that she told investigators she 
recognized Ruiz 'as the person in the video cutting off the foot of
Saunders'.

Another person interviewed by 
detectives said Ruiz told him he 'had been the one that planned the 
entire incident which resulted in the death of Carina Saunders'.

Massey, while jailed on drug charges,
shared details of the murder with two inmates, according to a 
probable cause affidavit filed with his murder charge.

He told one that he 
participated in the homicide and they 'they cut the girl's arms and legs
off'.

The second inmate told police Massey 
'gave handwritten statements in the form of passed notes' describing 
what parts of the woman's body were dismembered and how the body was wrapped before disposal.

Downour, who told investigators she left the house soon after Saunders and Hanshaw arrived, said Massey, who she also knew as 'Country,' was there when she left.

A confidential witness told police she was kidnapped and forced to watch as members of a human trafficking ring tortured and killed Saunders to send a message to others to cooperate with their illegal activities..

According to court records, Massey admitted to kidnapping a woman and making her watch as Saunders was tortured and killed October 9.

Massey also described how Saunders' body was dismembered and left in a field behind the Homeland grocery store, 15 miles away from her home in Mustang.
