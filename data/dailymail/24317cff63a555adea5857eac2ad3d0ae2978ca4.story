A sailor who ran into trouble in the middle of the ocean was saved after sending a desperate SOS to his girlfriend more than 1,000 miles away.

Guy Meuser sprung a leak in the mid-Atlantic when he was 300 miles from the nearest land, and when he was unable to bail himself out he started calling Agnes Goeman back home in Belgium.

As his phone battery was running out, he made contact with his girlfriend, who arranged for the 50-year-old to be rescued.

Rescuers made contact with a British 
container vessel, Anvil Point, which was near Mr Meuser's yacht Jalini

From her flat in Ghent, Ms Goeman called a maritime rescue service in Ostend.

Rescuers made contact with a British container vessel, Anvil Point, which was near Mr Meuser's yacht Jalini 300 miles north of Ascenscion Island.

After 24 hours trying to bail himself out, the experienced sailor gave up and transferred to a rubber dinghy and paddled over the ship which had come to the rescue.

'Guy was at the end of the world, a good 1750 miles from Brazil and 900 miles from the African coast,' Ms Goeman said. 'It was touch and go that he could be saved in the stormy conditions.

'The rescue service could not contact anybody on the African side and the Brazilians were not so reliable. But we had Guy's position and after hours of anguish we found the British boat.'

Anvil Point took Mr Meuser to Ascension Island, a British overseas territory, where he caught a plane to London.

The Belgian explorer was on a voyage from Uruguay back to Europe.

'Since he retired from work he spends all his time sailing the seas,' his sister Anne said. 'It's his great passion.'

Mr Meuser has previously posted on sailing websites looking for crewmates to join him on his adventures.

He has advertised for companions on trips to Guadeloupe, Brazil and the Canary Islands, among other destinations.
