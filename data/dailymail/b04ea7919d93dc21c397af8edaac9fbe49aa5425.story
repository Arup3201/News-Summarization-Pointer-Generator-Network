A 68-year-old woman has killed her husband and critically injured her daughter and son-in-law after accidentally plowing her SUV through her house and crashing it into a lake - all while her 3-year-old grandson sat on her lap.

Police arrested Carol Fedigan after the tragic accident Saturday night at Sammamish Lake, Washington, outside Seattle when they came to suspect she was driving under the influence.

Her horrified neighbors, however, say that Ms Fedigan was simply re-parking her brand-new Jeep when it suddenly accelerated out of control. Before her arrest, she said she thought a mechanical problem was to blame for the crash.

Edge of disaster: The SUV hung over the lake by its rear wheels after smashing through a house and a back deck Saturday night. Neighbors say mechanical failure could be to blame

The Jeep smashed a hole in the lake house as it powered through a front wall. Carol Fedigan, 69, was driving and her 3-year-old grandson was on her lap

Ms Fedigan's husband, David Walker, 70, was inside the house when she smashed through the living room. He was killed.

Her daughter Megan Berry and son-in-law Sean Berry were on the back porch. They were were run over by the speeding car and are currently in critical condition at Harborview Medical Center.

The SUV came to a stop with its back wheels caught on the porch and its front end dangling in the lake.

The toddler was not hurt - nor was Ms Fedigan.

'She had her grandson on her lap, was re-parking the car, put it into gear and it just took,' neighbor Kevin Connolly told KIRO-TV. 

Another neighbor told KING5-TV that she could not get the SUV into gear correctly and it suddenly accelerated 40 feet through the house.

Police, however, suspect alcohol or drugs are a factor.

She is charged with one count of vehicular homicide and two counts of vehicular assault.

Married: Ms Fedigan, 68, faces vehicular homicide charges for killing her husband David, 70. Police believe she may have been under the influence at the time of the crash

Police drew blood from her and are awaiting the results of a toxicology test, which could take several weeks to come back.

Authorities will also examine the car to determine whether there was a mechanical malfunction that caused the acceleration.

'It's just sad you know. To kill your husband, tough. It’s tough,' neighbor Will Pickering told KIRO.
