A cousin of the deadly nightshade plant is thriving in Britain because of the balmy weather - with experts warning its poisonous berries could kill.

The fruit of the black nightshade, or solanum nigrum, is highly toxic but can easily be mistaken for plump, juicy blueberries.

It normally grows in remote farmland but a combination of a wet spring and sizzling summer has helped the dangerous weed take hold in urban areas.

Botanists say the berries can be turned into food and herbal medicine once they are ripened.

However, if they are consumed in their unripe state they contain the two poisons - atropine and solanin - which can prove deadly to humans and livestock.

Mother Michelle Paine noticed the plant growing near her home in Penzance, Cornwall, and researched into whether the fruit was safe to eat.

After discovering the threat it poses she wants parents and local authorities to take urgent action.

Michelle, a local councillor and mum to daughter Serena Matthews, two, said: 'All it takes is for a toddler to reach out and pick a berry and there could be a very serious situation.

'The berries look just like blueberries, which are my two-year-old daughter’s favourite, and are about two foot off the ground - a perfect height for youngsters.

'If a child was physically vulnerable and ate one of the berries, it might not just result in an injury - it could be fatal.'

Freelance botanist and ecologist Derek Green confirmed the plant was black nightshade.

He said: 'I wouldn’t recommend anyone eating it but from what I can ascertain, its toxicity is highly variable and dependent upon which strain of the species you’re dealing with.

'In parts of the world its leaves are used in salads and the ripe berries are widely eaten, but it does appear to be the case that the unripe berries can be highly toxic.'

Guy Barter, chief horticultural advisor at the Royal Horticultural Society, said the weed was thriving because of the weather.

He said: 'It’s a plant that likes fertile soils so for it to grow in the streets is really very surprising. 

'The wet spring we witness combined with this summers hot weather has produced perfect conditions for the plant.

'I wouldn’t suggest anyone eating the berries. They very similar to edible berries but if someone was to eat them it could potentially be dangerous.

'Fatalities have been recorded in literature and farm animals have also been killed.'

Cornwall Council said it was up to local town authorities to arrange for bushes and verges to be sprayed with particular herbicides.

Highways and drainage manager Andy Stevenson said: 'For the current year there is only sufficient funding for the control of ragwort and Japanese knotweed.

'All towns and parish councils were notified of this decision at the beginning of the year and given the opportunity to provide a weed-spraying service from their own funds.

'The council has been working with those who expressed an interest to enable this work to be done.'
