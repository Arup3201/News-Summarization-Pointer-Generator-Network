Its the time of the day after work and school when the family gather around the dinner table to break bread and share stories- or it used to be.

New research shows that although most British families spend time discussing sporting events and TV programmes, we simply don't talk as a family as much as we used to.

Events in London topped the poll as the most popular dinner table topics in recent times, including Andy Murray's Wimbledon win and the birth of Prince George.

Talking point: Buzz around the birth of the Royal baby made its way to the dinner table, where families said they discussed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George

Success story: Uplifting topics of conversation including Andy Murray's victory at Wimbledon this Summer were more likely to be discussed by a family that world news or politics

Researchers from the Museum of London surveyed 2,000 families and discovered that they are more likely to discuss light topics like the recent heatwave, than world news or politics.

Just a fifth of those surveyed said they often chat about politics.

Sharon Ament, the Director of
the Museum of London said: 'London is where it’s at this summer - on 
the tips of tongues and fuelling family conversations across the 
country.

Hasn't it been hot lately? Small talk about the recent heatwave has been on everyone's lips, according to new research

Hot topics: Chris Froome's (pictured in yellow jersey) victory at the Tour de France and England's success at the Ashes are high on the list of family conversations

'Wimbledon success, royal baby fever and Olympics nostalgia – 
what all these positive topics share is a home in the capital city.

Results showed that 40per cent felt they don't have meaningful conversations as a family and nearly two thirds said the art of good conversation is a dying skill.

The study showed that the average British family spends just 22 minutes talking during an after an evening meal.

The family sits down to eat together around ten times each month- less than three times a week.

The rise in TV dinner and technological distractions are just some of the reasons one in four parents feel they don't know what is going on in their children's lives.

Ms Ament said: 'You can understand 
why light-hearted news - like sport or television - dominate our daily 
lives.

It can be tough for parents with kids of different ages to engage
the whole family in conversations that appeal to them all - 
particularly with the hi-tech gadgets that most kids carry around every 
day.

'In this age of technology many parents 
are anxious about bonding with their children and really engaging them 
on a regular basis.'

Hectic routines, general fatigue and 
‘because the television is usually on’ were the biggest reasons cited for families not engaging in conversation.

In fact, 45 per cent of meals eaten by the average British family are 
done so in front of the television.

A quarter of parents surveyed said they feel they have less conversation with their own children than they did with their parents did when they were young.

Results showed that 42 per cent of parents worry they don’t talk enough as a family and nearly half find it hard to bond with their children at times.
