Google have teamed up with the world's museums for a massive update to their online 'cultural institute' that offers users the chance to learn about some of the major figures and events of the past century.

The latest additions to the Google Cultural Institute archives, available to view from today, are intended as an online educational resource to preserve history in a place that is accessible to people when they need it.

Major world events like D-Day, the Holocaust and the fight against Apartheid are described with a mixture of photos, historical account and contemporary quotes.

Each of the 42 exhibitions launched today features a narrative which links the archive material together to unlock the different perspectives, nuances and tales behind the events.

The stories have been put together by 17 institutions including museums, foundations and others who have drawn on their archives of letters, manuscripts, first-hand video testimonials and more.

Much of the material is very moving - and some is being shown online for the first time.

The new exhibitions are the latest chapter in the work of the Google Cultural Institute, which has already showcased the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Holocaust Museum at Yad Vashem and the Nelson Mandela archives online.

Just as with those projects, users can zoom into photos to sea them in great detail and search through millions of items for a specific country, person, even or date.

Vibrant colour: The Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II is also featured in the archives

Among the great 20th Century events now available for users to explore is the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, which includes vibrant colour photos of the event provided by Historvius.

Mike Lewis, CEO and founder of Historvius.com, said: 'By pulling together a unique collection of bite-sized commentary, contemporary accounts and even fascinating colour images of the events themselves, our exhibit helps to bring the vibrancy of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II back to life and shines a fresh focus on this pivotal moment in modern British history.

'For a country still rebuilding from the devastation of the Second World War, still facing rationing and still finding its way in a post-war world, this jubilant event brought a new sense of purpose and energy to the nation; not unlike the recent Royal Wedding of 2011.'

Liberation hero: Steve Biko, the South African black rights campaigner, is among the historical figures remembered in the archives

The D-Day exhibition, produced in collaboration with the Imperial War Museum, shows details of the famous landings including colour photographs, personal letters and the D-Day order itself from Admiral Ramsay.

Amanda Mason, Curator of IWM’s online exhibition D-Day on the Cultural Institute said, 'We are incredibly excited to launch our first online exhibition.'

She added: 'As the nation’s leading social history attraction, one of our highest priorities is to share our eclectic and interesting collections with audiences from further afield, so they too are able to discover and explore.

'This is a fantastic opportunity for audiences across the globe to discover and see up close some of the most iconic works.

'We’ve featured a vast array of material, which you will be able to view at your leisure in high resolution, for professional or personal use, at any time and in any place.'

But some of the most poignant material on the site is centred around the fight against Apartheid, which was produced together with three South African institutions, including the Steve Biko Foundation and the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory.

Obenewa Amponsah, director of fundraising and partnerships at the foundation, said: 'We decided to participate because bringing this material online through the Cultural Institute provides a great opportunity to make known not only the legacy of Steve Biko - but so many other historic figures and events - in a dynamic and accessible way.'

Sello Hatang, head of programming at Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, said: 'The Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory is excited to launch the second phase of the Nelson Mandela Digital Archive as part of the Google Cultural Institute.

'We believe that both local and international audiences will have greater access to the life and times of Nelson Mandela.'
