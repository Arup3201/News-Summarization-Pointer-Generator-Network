As they prepare in the dressing room, only one of these bare-chested competitors seems to have a chance in the contest they are about to enter.

For it is hard understand what the man at the back of this photograph is doing in the Israeli bodybuilding championships. 

Far from having a six-pack of toned abdominal muscle, his pale torso looks as if it has been more acquainted with six-packs of beer.

What's he got that I haven't? The flabby man, circled, admires himself as a toned rival has fake tan applied

As he watches his rival having his fake tan topped up by an assistant armed with a paint roller, the man seems unconcerned that he lacks the same chiselled physique. 

Perhaps he is hoping that the judges will be too distracted by his snazzy white shades to notice his flabby tummy and unflattering ‘moobs’.

The men were pictured at the 2014 Israeli National Amateur Bodybuilders Association Championships, held this week in Netanya.

NABBA is the first and the original competitve bodybuilding association. 

Formed in 1950, NABBA's first Mr Universe contest was won by Steve Reeves, who went on to make over 30 Hercules movies. 

High stakes: The man will compete alongside these bodybuilders in Israel's national championships

Preparation: Contestants like this one spend a year sculpting their bodies for the three judging phases

Star-studded: Arnold Schwarzenegger has won the world championship of this event four times

Top bodybuilders who won the Mr Universe title include Reg Park, Bill Pearl and Arnold Schwarzenegger (four-times winner).

There are nine branches of the NABBA council across the UK, and each holds an annual Mr & Miss Britain qualifier.

The winners graduate to the European and Universe championships.

Last year saw 151 athletes from 36 different countries compete for the title.

Members have to be at least 14 years old, though younger competitors can apply to join with their parents' permission.

Testing: The men and women have a 'front, back and side' line up, individual routine, and posing contest

Tense: Women in glitzy bikinis look fierce before they take to the stage to vie for the revered title

To win, they must succeed in the three phases.

First there is a front, back and side in line up.

This is followed by an individual posing routine, not to exceed one minute and 30 seconds.

The contestants then stand in a line and compare poses.

Tanning colour is only permitted at the discretion of the organiser, though most accept it as a given.
