Unprecedented: Online sales were up 20 per cent this year as more people stayed at home to shop

Online shoppers made history on Friday spending almost £600million in the post-Christmas sales from the comfort of their homes.

Analysts claim the bad weather likely contributed to the unprecedented figure, which beat last year's takings by 20 per cent.

Meanwhile, there were less in-store shoppers than expected, with the total spend of £2.2billion falling short of the predicted £2.9billion.

The findings by IMRG, the internet retailing association, showed the average internet shopper took 40 minutes each out of Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day to take advantage of cut prices.

Retailers celebrated a record-breaking Boxing Day with £540million spent in just 24 hours, up 10 per cent.

Christmas Day spending was also up 50 per cent as numerous stores started cutting prices online a day early.

The number of people filling their baskets on mobiles and tablets is up 50 per cent this year, according to John Lewis.

Andrew McClelland, IMRG Chief Operations and Policy Officer, said: 'Mobile device usage really is changing the way we shop. Online always used to be mutually exclusive and not always consistent with the High Street.

'Smartphones, accounting for 20 per cent of mobile-enabled sales on retailers' websites, really are helping customers shop whilst on the move.

'Tablets are also accelerating this mobile change, lowering the barriers to entry, with prices continuing to fall, their design and interfaces being less intimidating and truly being 'always on' so we as shoppers can now truly shop whenever and wherever we want.'

It is far from the end, experts claim, with £1.8bn forecast to be spent in stores today, according to the Centre for Retail Research.

The £22bn total is expected to be reached by mid-January.
