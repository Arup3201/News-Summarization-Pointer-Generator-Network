The son of a London taxi driver is on his bike. James Ward became the first British man to exit Wimbledon, stumbling in straight sets to Mikhail Youzhny.

In credit to the British No 3, he initially put up a respectable fight against the 17th seed, but ultimately the quality of the Russian’s groundstrokes proved too significant and he fell 6-2, 6-2, 6-1.

In each of the first two sets Ward set a trend of dragging points into long rallies, but lacked the guile to finish points.

Youzhny suffered no such issue and, 
having forced break points in Ward’s opening service game, broke twice 
in the first set. His backhand, either sliced or with power, was 
brilliant.

Ward was still in
 the fight in the second, imploring the crowd to offer some assistance, 
but he was again broken twice, the first at 2-3 down coming via a double
 fault. He gave away another break, and with it the set, with a long 
forehand from the middle of the court. Youzhny proceeded to run away 
with the third.

The 
disappointment for Ward, quite aside from exiting in the first round for
 the fourth time in five attempts, will have been his failure to 
significantly threaten the Russian’s serve. He forced only three break 
points and converted none, despite hitting the same number of winners 
(24) as the man ranked 137 places higher.  

By contrast, Youzhny took six of his 14 chances and wrapped up the match in one hour and 45 minutes. 

Out: Ward had no answer to his opponent as he went down without a fuss

Ward said: 'I thought he played very well, executed his game. I obviously didn't play as well as I'd hoped. I have to go away and look at the tape and see what happened. It's not enjoyable watching matches that you lose. But it's all part of the process. It needs to be done.

'As I say, he played very well. At different times in the match where I had a few half chances, he came up with the goods. That was the difference.'

Ward pocketed £27,000 for his first-round exit - up from £23,500 for first-round losers in 2013 - and said the money is vital to his continued status as a tour player. He added: 'There's 150, 200 guys out there who are all playing the same tournaments week in, week out. If you have a coach or a trainer around you, obviously it becomes expensive to travel the world, different country every week.

'But, it's a massive help. I'm very grateful for the help I've always received from the All England Club and the LTA.  Without that I wouldn't be able to carry on playing probably.'
