Forbes has released their list of the 72 most powerful people in the world, and for the second day in a row, the Leader of the Free World is getting some not so great news. 

Once again, Russia's  Vladmir Putin has come out on top, followed by President Barack Obama and People's Republic of China leader Xi Jinping.

Rounding out the top five were Pope Francis and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Riding high: Vladmir Putin (above) won the honors of most powerful man in the world from Forbes for the second year running

Second fiddle: president Obama (above) came in second, a feeling he is becoming all too familiar with following Tuesday's midterm elections 

The list is capped at 72 as there is one person ranked for every 100 million people on the planet.

Editors at the magazine then rank people based on the factors including the number of followers they have (be it the population of their country, number of people who follow their faith, or their employee base), the financial resources at their disposal, and how they use their power. 

More people, more power: People's Republic of China leader Xi Jinping (above)

More parishioners, more problems: Pope Francis (above) placed fourth, largely on the strength of the number of Catholics in the world 

'No one would call Vladmir Putin a good guy,' explains the magazine. 

'In 2014 he strong-armed his way into possession of Crimea and waged an ugly proxy war in neighboring Ukraine, during which an almost certainly Russian-supplied surface-to-air missile downed a civilian jetliner.' 

'But as the undisputed, unpredictable and unaccountable head of an energy-rich, nuclear-tipped state, no one would ever call him weak.'

Ladies night: Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen (above) made the list at #6, making this the first time two woman were in the top ten

No brainer: Bill Gates (above) placed the highest among the business players on the list, coming in at #7

Other notable names on the list include Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen at #6, Bill Gates at #7 and Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and #9.

Prime Minister David Cameron rounds out the top ten.

European union: Angela Merkel (left), the no nonsense German Chancellor came in at #5 for the second year, while Mario Draghi (right), President of the European Central Bank, was #8

This is the first time since the list began in 2009 that two woman made the top ten and, while the world may be ever changing, the top five has not changed from 2013.

As for the most notable newcomer, that would most likely have to be ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who ranks #54 and is one of only 12 newcomers.
