A dazzling white smile is practically essential for any celebrity hoping to make it onto the red 
carpet - they don't call it a Hollywood smile for nothing.

But it seems that pearly whites are imperative when searching for your perfect man too, as a new study reveals the first thing men notice about a woman are her teeth.

According to the latest study, they rate as the most important feature for a man 
when checking out a new mate.

Indeed, dental credentials took the top spot of the top ten things men judge women on, taking 58 per cent of 
votes.

It's all about the teeth: The male population have voted and the results show that teeth are what they most judge women for- the Duchess of Cambridge and Tulisa have been widely complimented for theirs

The study, which was carried out over three years, has resulted in a list of the top 10 things men judge women on. Revealingly, over half of the list focused on appearance-based elements.

After teeth, it is a women's hair that men are concerned with (51 per cent) followed by their clothes (45 per cent), found the study by Match.com.

Dr Uchenna, Oral-B Smile Director, said of the results: 'Make sure you treat your teeth every day - they’ll definitely thank you for it and it will make you feel more confident, so you’ll be proud to show off your gorgeous smile.

'People are becoming more aware of their smiles and I have seen a rise in my clients asking how they can achieve a naturally whiter smile.

'Oral B found that almost one in three 
Brits do not brush their teeth twice a day, which will certainly not 
help to bag that second date this Valentine's Day.'

Celebrities
 such as Cheryl Cole and Louis Walsh have long realised that a top set 
of gnashers will take them a long way - and have all had extensive 
dental work to perfect their straight, white smiles.

Improvements: Nicole Roberts teeth have undergone a style transformation since her humble days starting out in Girls Aloud

Vast improvement: Cheryl didn't gain her place in the top ten smiles for nothing but like her bandmate Nicola, her teeth have undergone great improvements

Take note: It seems that men have taken heed of their own advice and the likes of Louis Walsh have had dental work
