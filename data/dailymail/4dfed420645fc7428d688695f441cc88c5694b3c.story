Steven Gerrard has officially announced that he will leave Liverpool in the summer, sparking tributes from his current team-mates and those who once wore the club's famous red shirt alongside him.

Former Liverpool players including Xabi Alonso, Michael Owen and Jonjo Shelvey have also praised the 34-year-old midfielder on Twitter.

Brendan Rodgers: 'It is almost an impossible task to find the words to appropriately sum up Steven Gerrard and his importance to Liverpool,' Rodgers told the club's website.

'This is an era where the word "legend" is vastly overused, but in his case it actually doesn't do him justice.

'From a personal point of view I will always have gratitude for the support he gave me, when I arrived here as manager.

'Steven came to see me and promised he would be 100 per cent behind me and do everything he could to help as we looked to introduce new ideas and a new way of working. He wasn't just true to his word, he vastly exceeded it.'

Michael Owen, a former Liverpool and England team-mate of Gerrard, reacts to the news on Twitter

Emre Can: 'I have learned a lot from him. Steven is the greatest captain Liverpool have ever had and I feel comfortable on the pitch because I always know he is behind me. I hope to be similar to Gerrard but it isn't going to be easy because he's been so successful.' 

Adam Lallana: 'I grew up watching him. To my best mates, he's their legend. For me to be playing alongside him, not just at England but at club level, is quite surreal really.' 

Rickie Lambert: 'Stevie is his own man but he is Mr Liverpool. He's No 1 for me and I think he always will be. He has meant everything to me, growing up as a Liverpool fan. The nights he has given Liverpool fans are unbelievable - I'll never forget them and I know Liverpool fans will never forget them.'

Glen Johnson: 'Steven has been a fantastic player for many years and what he has done for Liverpool Football Club is just huge.'

Jordan Henderson: 'He is a top player but he is also a top person. The lads can go to him with anything and he will always help them out and put them first. That is massive as a captain. With the aura that he has got, he could be a different person but he is very humble.'

Jon Flanagan: 'Steven Gerrard was my hero growing up so to run out and play with him has been a dream come true. He is still my hero now.'

Mario Balotelli: 'Wow. I think of him being at the same level as [Andrea] Pirlo. Vision, technique but he is powerful as well. Stevie can do anything, he's an amazing player. It's going to be very difficult for the team to find another player like him in the future.'

Lucas Leiva: 'When you say the name Steven Gerrard, you automatically think Liverpool Football Club. He really is the symbol of the club. He is a player who has always valued the club, too. I've never played with a player as complete as him.'

Javier Manquillo: 'The first time I watched Gerrard play, I was only a child. Now I play in the same team with him, he's a truly great player and it's a dream come true to share the field with him.'
