Susan Millman was jailed for having sex with a 15-year-old boy. She admitted two offences of causing the teenage boy to engage in sex with her in her Jeep

A married woman had sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy in her car after enticing him by flashing flashing her breasts on the internet.

Susan Millman, 47, used a webcam to try and tempt other teenage boys by promising them sex in video shows online.

Millman, from Grimsby, whose husband runs a coach company, has now been jailed for 18 months after admitting two offences of causing the teenage boy to engage in sex with her in her Jeep.

Grimsby Crown Court also banned her from working with children for life and ordered to sign on the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years.

Photographs
of her appeared on a social networking site and were viewed by 
teenagers. Police became aware when an adult was informed and the victim
was interviewed.

Prosecuting
barrister James Byatt said Millman's initial contact with the youth was
on Facebook and was of a friendly nature prior to the two offences 
between September and November 2010 and January and March 2011.

He
said: 'She took a caring attitude and he confided in her. He felt he 
could unburden himself and they had hugs. After rows with his mother he 
felt he could go to confide in her.

'The nature of the communication changed and it became more sexual. She would comment on his good looks.

'There was a message for him on Facebook every day and texts of a sexual nature were sent. There were so many he asked her to stop it when he was at school.'

Mr Byatt gave details of the first sexual encounter when she picked him up in her Jeep. On another occasion he climbed out of his bedroom window and again she picked him up in the Jeep in which they had intercourse.

Detectives later discovered evidence on a webcam of her revealing herself and making provocative statements to one of the boys.

Millman, 47, was sentenced at Grimsby Crown Court today to 18 months behind bars for sexually abusing the boy

She was arrested on May 24 and told police the contact had not been sexual - just kisses. She told police: 'He is chatty and bubbly, just like me.'

Mr Byatt said the youth could not consent to having sex and she should have been aware of his emotional development.

Having had contact with his mother in the past, she ought to have realised the boy’s vulnerable state, he said.

In a statement on the impact on her son, his mother said there had been upset and he was 'more insecure'.

The statement said the youth felt embarrassed and partly to blame. The defendant, dressed in a blouse and black trousers, sobbed throughout, with her head bowed.

'Female sex offenders should not be treated any differently. I am satisfied the court has recognised that.'

For Millman, Simon Hirst said his client was adamant it was no fault of the teenager.

He said: 'She feels she has let a large number of people down. Her life will never be the same.

'There was no element of planning. She behaved totally inappropriately and she takes total blame.'

Mr Hirst said his client felt low self esteem at the time. Mr Millman went to work at 6.30am, until very late and she gained attention from the youth.

Mr Hirst said: 'The relationship may have compensated for shortcomings in her marriage. She is remorseful and accepts full responsibility.'

Judge David Tremberg told Millman: 'You were in a position of trust. You could not have failed to know that any form of amorous relationship, let alone full sexual relations with a boy 30 years your junior would have been wholly inappropriate and illegal.

'You were prepared to engage him on Facebook, by telephone and texts. At the time you were involved he should have been concentrating at school. He did not need to be distracted.'

He added she had 'willingly' exposed herself to the boys on the internet. Judge Tremberg said the offence had harmed the relationship between the boy and his mother and the custodial sentence would act as a punishment and a deterrent to others.

Following the hearing, investigating officer Detective Sergeant Stewart Watson said: 'Female sex offenders should not be treated any differently. I am satisfied the court has recognised that.'

He said officers at Humberside Police safeguarding team were keen to hear from any other victims: 'I would urge victims of sex offences not to be put off by the justice system. There are support mechanisms in place.'

Millman's husband, who owns a coach company, attended court and was said to be 'standing by his wife', according to her barrister.
