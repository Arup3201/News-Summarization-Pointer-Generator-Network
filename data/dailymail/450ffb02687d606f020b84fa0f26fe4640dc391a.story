This is the haunting last image Peaches Geldof posted on Instagram just 24 hours before she was found dead in unexplained circumstances at her Kent home.

The 25-year-old wrote 'me and mum' alongside the image in a tragic final post just a day before she was found dead.

Her sudden death has heartbreaking similarities to the untimely passing of her mother in 2000 at her London home, leaving behind her young children to be raised by Bob Geldof.

Miss Yates, a TV presenter who had three children with Bob Geldof, died of a heroin overdose at her home in Notting Hill.

Peaches was just 11-years-old at the time and vividly remembers the day her mother passed away.

She said: 'I remember the day my mother died, and it’s still hard to talk about it. I just blocked it out. I went to school the next day because my father’s mentality was "keep calm and carry on".

'So we all went to school and tried to act as if nothing had happened. But it had happened. I didn’t grieve. I didn’t cry at her funeral. I couldn’t express anything because I was just numb to it all. I didn’t start grieving for my mother properly until I was maybe 16.'

Peaches
went through a period of heavy drinking and taking drugs as a teenager,
but said the memory of her own mother's overdose stopped her from 
spiralling out of control.

IIn the days leading up to her death, Peaches posted images of her two sons Astala, 20 months, and Phaedra, 10 months, at home on the picture-sharing site.

Three weeks ago she also uploaded an image of a book she was called Magick: In Theory and Practice by Aleister Crowley.

He was an early 20th century writer and magician, who wrote about mysticism and paranormal beliefs.

She also told her followers she was reading William Todd Schultz's Torment Saint: The Life of Elliot Smith.

The book is based on the musician, who died in 2003 from stab wounds following a battle with drug addiction.

Following his death a coroner could not say conclusively whether the wounds were self-inflicted and his fans have contested the circumstances ever since.

The last adult to see Miss Yates alive was a former heroin addict she had met during her time in rehab.

But her four-year-old daughter Heavenly Hiraani Tiger 
Lily, whose father Michael Hutchence died just three years before, was alone 
with her when she passed away. 

It
 seemed she had never recovered from the death of the INXS frontman in 1997.

Bob Geldof, the father of Yates's first then took the orphaned child into his home, so she could be brought up with her two half-sisters.

Yates, who was 41 when she died, married Bob Geldof in 1986, after ten years together.

She made her name as a television presenter, hosting programmes such as the Big Breakfast and The Tube.

She
 met Mr Hutchence in 1985 during a TV interview  the lead singer of
 rock band INXS, On the morning of 22 November 1997, Hutchence was found
 dead in his hotel room in Sydney.

Miss Yates, who was in London at the time, was informed of the tragic death by her friend Belinda Brewin.

The couple's daughter was placed in Geldof's custody with her half-sisters.

Following
 her death coroner, Paul Knapman, said the amount she snorted would not 
have killed an addict, but as an 'unsophisticated taker of heroin', Miss 
Yates had no tolerance to the drug.
