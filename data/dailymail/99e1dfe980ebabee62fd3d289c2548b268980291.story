Michael Owen has hailed Steven Gerrard as the second-best player of his generation only bettered by Zinedine Zidane following the Liverpool midfielder's decision to retire from England duty.

Owen - who played with Gerrard in Liverpool's first team for six years - believes the 34-year-old can hold his head high after 114 caps and 21 goals for the Three Lions during a 14-year stint.

He told Sportlobster: 'In my career I was fortunate to have played alongside some of the greatest footballers of my generation and the biggest compliment I can pay to Stevie is that in my opinion he is second only to Zinedane Zidane in terms of world-class status.

'Rather like when I was considering hanging up my boots, you go through all the pros and cons of staying or going and you consider all the personal and professional hopes and dreams that you’ve held on to for so many years.

'Ultimately you have to make a decision that you feel most comfortable with and one that you hope will be in the best interests of everyone who is likely to affected.

'In Stevie’s case he obviously feels that it’s time for the younger generation to step forward and quite literally fill his boots at international level.

'Having reached that decision we can only admire his conviction and congratulate him on an international career to be proud of.

'Of course he will have wanted the team to have achieved more at the six major tournaments that he played in, but with 114 caps and 21 goals to his name, not to mention captaining his country on 38 occasions he can be very proud of his achievements.'

Owen, who himself made 89 appearances for England, saw he knew instantly when first saw Gerrard play that he was all set to become a star, later forming a formidable partnership with the midfielder at Anfield.

'The first time I saw Stevie play, as an 11-year-old in the Liverpool youth ranks, it was obvious how much ability he possessed and that in all probability he would  become the complete, modern footballer.

'I first met Stevie at Liverpool’s training ground in 1992 when we were on our way through the club’s youth ranks and in those days there was no standing on ceremony when judging talent.

'The Liverpool coaches quite openly put the best players in the same team and as we were considered two of the brightest prospects we’d always be paired together.

Walking away: Gerrard has called time on a 14-year international career with England

'I knew very quickly that I was playing alongside someone special. There wasn’t a particular moment of realisation as such.

'With me, I would make a forward run and Stevie would just keep delivering the ball right into my path. That’s how it was with us for the next 20 years at Liverpool and then with England. No-one created more goals for me.'

The retired forward also hopes Gerrard's decision to call time on his international career will bring him more success domestically, with the Premier League crown a trophy Gerrard is still desperate to add to his collection.

He added: 'I believe that Stevie’s decision to stand down from International duty has in no small part been made with a view to prolonging his career at Liverpool.

'Despite England’s lack of success during his time with them I for one hope that he can add to his already impressive haul with Liverpool by lifting the one piece of domestic silverware that has eluded him thus far.'
