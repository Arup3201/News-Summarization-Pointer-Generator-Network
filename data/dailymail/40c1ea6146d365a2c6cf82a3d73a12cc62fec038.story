An actress whose abusive fiancé lashed out at her when he discovered she was due to appear nude in a play was forced to use her stage costumes to hide bruises.

Beverley Stuart-Cole, 48, starred in a series of theatre productions while secretly hiding marks caused by a string of beatings by her husband-to-be Paul Conway.

In one violent rage, the 46-year old builder from Sale, Greater Manchester, attacked Ms Stuart-Cole after learning she had been asked to go nude in a play based on the Alfred Hitchcock classic Psycho.

On another occasion, Ms Stuart-Cole - who regularly appears at the Garrick Theatre in Altrincham, Greater Manchester - had to use the long gloves in her stage costume to hide deep bruises on her arms caused by Conway.

Today, Ms Stuart-Cole - who won a best actress prize for her role in An Inspector Calls and also starred in the stage productions of The Graduate and Calendar Girls - said she was 'ecstatic' after Conway was jailed found guilty of three counts of assault.

Conway was jailed for 20 weeks after the judge said he showed 'consistent violence' towards Ms Stuart-Cole and did not have a shred of remorse.

Speaking after the conviction, Ms Stuart-Cole said: 'We were planning our wedding and I thought I was in love with him but he turned into a nutter and just changed. It was like a coin flipped over and he became a different person.

'He was jealous and possessive and he even didn't want me to do the scenes in the Hitchcock Blonde play as they are of a quite explicit nature.

'During another show he was vile to me and I had bruises on my arms. Luckily I was wearing long gloves in the show so nobody could see the bruises.'

During his trial at Trafford Magistrates' Court, the court heard how Conway punched, throttled and kicked his bride-to-be during a series of attacks.

In the first incident, he lifted up Ms Stuart-Cole as she sat at her desk when he believed she was browsing dating websites. 

He then dragged her to the kitchen where he grabbed her throat with such force that she was left with finger marks across her neck. He also kicked her while she lay helpless on the floor, the court was told. 

Prosecutor Annabelle Hartley said that, on another occasion, Conway lunged at Ms Stuart-Cole while she was running upstairs and followed her into the bedroom.

The judge said the attacks on Ms Stuart-Cole amounted to 'consistent violence'  

The court heard he then pushed her onto the bed and grabbed her by the jaw, causing red marks. He also punched her in the arm. 

During the third attack, Conway kicked Ms Stuart-Cole while they were having an argument on the sofa, leaving bruises on her thigh. 

The court heard Ms Stuart-Cole had called the police twice previously to report the attacks but  withdrew her statement on each occasion. 

But, after the third attack, Ms Stuart-Cole broke off the relationship and went on to give evidence against Conway.

A day after the last attack, she also posted on Facebook saying: 'I'm still standing folks. And always will.'

Later, in a statement given to police, she said the attacks have left her a frightened woman with a deep distrust of men who is now 'ridiculously sensitive' to any sudden noise.

She said: 'I was constantly looking behind me and if I was on my own and there was a loud noise I would jump.

'If I heard footsteps I was panicking and I wasn't sleeping. It was horrible and the stress has a horrible effect on you... It makes you paranoid and all this has left me with a distrust of men.

'I also have very graphic nightmares and have become ridiculously sensitive to any noise I hear.' 

The court heard how Conway and Ms Stuart-Cole had been in a relationship for one year after meeting in a pub in July 2012. He proposed in February last year.

Ms Stuart-Cole said: 'He was charming and generous but almost too charming - always buying rounds for everybody and showering me with gifts.

'The first time he went mad was when I was sending an innocent message to an ex-boyfriend. He chased me up the stairs and threw me on the bed and pinned me down. He had one hand round my throat and was yelling over nothing.

'I used to find myself apologising and would smooth it over and sometimes he would apologise and say he was stressed and say he was sorry. 

'But other times he wouldn't accept he was in the wrong. It's really hard when someone you love slaps you and is horrible.'

She added: 'We broke up in November last year. We had been to a funeral and he was staying here and he kicked me really hard.

'I started crying and said "stop doing that"and he stormed off. For days after we finished I could barely go down to the bins and would have to lock the door behind me. 

Conway who plans to appeal against his conviction, denied wrongdoing.

His lawyer Miss Rachel Good said: 'It's sad when a relationship comes to an end but is clear there has been no contact since last year.

'He is under no illusions as to how matters of domestic violence are looked upon in these courts.'

Sentencing, JP David Collins said: 'This was consistent violence on three separate occasions. The violence occurred in the victim's home and we have heard about the impact it has had on her. You have showed no remorse.'

The actress said: 'People say I'm a strong person but I don't think I am. I'm just ecstatic he's gone to prison because it's definitely what he deserves and hopefully it will stop him doing it to anybody else. He is a nasty man.

'To anyone suffering domestic violence I would say absolutely get the hell out and don't listen to a word of their excuses.'

As well as his jail sentence, Conway was ordered to pay her £400 compensation and banned from contacting her for two years.
