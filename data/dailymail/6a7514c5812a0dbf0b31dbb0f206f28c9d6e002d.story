The controversy over the leaked pictures of Prince Harry naked in Las Vegas has focused fresh  attention on the role of the two police protection officers who were in charge of him at the time.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that one of the Prince’s most long-serving protection officers, who has worked for the Royal Family since 1995, was in charge of Harry’s security.

The round-the-clock protection officer accompanied the Prince to Vegas and was photographed with Harry at the Wet Republic pool party at the MGM hotel.

A close rapport: Harry and his favourite protection officer, who was on duty in Vegas when the prince was pictured naked, cheer on

The bodyguard, who wore sunglasses and a straw hat, was pictured surrounded by girls in bikinis, but he was in fact on duty. 

Together
with another  colleague, the protection officer, who is one of the 
Metropolitan Police’s elite SO14 team, was also in charge of the Prince 
when he was partying in the private suite at the exclusive Wynn Hotel, 
where the naked pictures were taken.

A
source told this newspaper that, since their return, both protection 
officers are likely to have been questioned over what happened in Las 
Vegas.

At Clarence House, 
the official residence of Prince Harry and the Prince of Wales, there 
are concerns that the young Royal and his chief protection officer have 
become overly friendly.

Harry always requests his favourite protection officer for overseas trips and the two men have a close rapport.

Prince William is also said to get along well with the amiable officer, who was a guest at last year’s Royal Wedding.

The
officer, who is in his early 40s and married with a young daughter, 
gets on well with the Princes’ friends and usually accompanies Harry 
when he goes away on holiday.

On
his Facebook page, which has now been deleted, he has posted a series 
of pictures of himself with Harry, who he refers to as ‘Spike’.

In
one he is photographed on Everest waving a Union Jack flag during the 
Walking with the Wounded expedition that Harry took part in earlier this
year.

In another, he 
is on holiday in the Okavenga Delta in Botswana with Prince Harry. In 
the picture the officer, who is stripped to the waist, is fishing.

One of his friends posted the comment: ‘Hard at work – again.’ A source said: ‘Harry and his protection officer get along very well.

'If Harry has a boring event he’ll take any protection officer, but when it comes to parties and going away he wants his No 1 man with him because he is very much one of the boys.’

Neither of the SO14 protection officers who were with Harry in Las Vegas are expected to face disciplinary action.

Despite the pictures being deeply embarrassing for the Royal Family, Harry was at no point in any danger.

Bernard Hogan-Howe, the  Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, has said it was not  the job of the royal protection officers to oversee the Prince’s behaviour.

‘Royal protection officers are there to protect him for security reasons, they are not there to regulate his life,’ Mr Hogan-Howe said.

It was, however, unusual that the protection officers did not vet Harry’s guests.

There were at least 15 girls  at the private party in the  hotel suite who Harry did not know. It is, say friends,  customary for party guests to hand over their digital cameras and mobile phones.

‘On some occasions the  protection officers will ask to delete any potentially  compromising pictures in order to protect the prince,’ says one of Harry’s entourage.

‘The rule is “lots of fun but no pictures”.’
