When it was reported that there was a lion on the loose in Essex, experts from the Colchester Zoo were called in to help.

But rather than dismiss the blurry shape in the photo for what it was - a domestic cat - the zoo's staff armed themselves with tranquilisers, and joined the £880-an-hour police hunt for the beast.

So it is perhaps no surprise that they have now had their animal-spotting abilities roundly mocked with an amusing online spoof advert.

Spoof advert: Colchester Zoo who sent out staff with tranquiliser guns looking for the 'wild animal'

The advert, which was posted on 
Facebook and Twitter, features pictures of puppies that have been 
billed as wolves, an earthworm as a snake and a guinea pig as a panda, 
with the slogan ‘let your imagination run wild’.

The joke came after holidaymakers in 
Essex claimed to have spotted a big cat on Sunday, prompting a 20-hour 
manhunt including armed officers, two police helicopters using 
heat-seeking equipment and zoo workers in St Osyth, Essex over the Bank 
Holiday weekend.

While residents were warned to stay 
indoors and holidaymakers at a nearby caravan park evacuated, it emerged
 that the wild animal was actually a large domestic cat called Teddy 
Bear.

The blunder, which made headlines, sparked many online spoof pictures and comments on Twitter.

Questions have been raised over why 
experts from Colchester Zoo and police believed the blurry photographs 
which sparked a costly search.

Colchester Zoo director Anthony Tropeano welcomed the tongue-in-cheek advert but defended his staff’s involvement in the case. 

He
 said: ‘It’s all a bit of fun and games and I think it was bound to 
happen after all the media coverage the Essex lion received.

‘I was amazed at just how big a story it became as it really was a storm in a teacup.

‘We were shown a very grainy image of the “Essex lion” on Sunday evening and I told police I couldn’t really tell what it was.

Teddy Bear: The lion on the loose turned out to be domestic cat Teddy Bear

Community in terror of pet: Teddy Bear's owner Ginny Murphy watched the drama unfold on television from Liverpool, where she was away and immediately had her suspicions

‘Later that night we were given a clearer image and told police it was not the right shape to be a lion. 

‘Unfortunately the police were in a position where they were damned if they do and damned if they don’t as you cannot risk public safety if there is any suspicion a dangerous animal is on the loose.’

Teddy Bear’s owner Ginny Murphy watched the drama unfold on television from Liverpool, where she was away and immediately had her suspicions about the blurry images.

Colchester Zoo is a popular South East tourist attraction and boasts more than 260 rare species including lions.

Mr Tropeano said: ‘As the only zoo in the county we can officially say we are the only ones to allow visitors a chance to see lions in Essex.

‘Instead of grainy images, visitors can get up close and personal with our animals and can.”

Some of the other spoofs about the Essex lion include the iconic scene from Disney classic the Lion King in which a young Simba looks out across the wasteland.

The caption reads: ‘What is that shadowy place? “It’s Essex, Simba. You must never go there”.’
