As the tragic events of 9/11 unfolded in New York, millions of Americans helplessly watched on their TV screens. Frank Culbertson helplessly watched from space.

Culbertson, 63, an astronaut who was aboard the International Space Station at the time, was the only American who wasn’t on Earth as the country came under attack on September 11, 2001.

While 220 miles above the Earth aboard the International Space Station, Culbertson took incredible pictures of the Twin Towers after they were struck by the hijacked jets.

Unique view: Frank Culbertson took this picture of the 9/11 attacks from the International Space Station. He was the only American off-planet at the time

As word of the terror strike reached him, the station was passing over New York, and what he saw had a profound effect on the astronaut.

In a letter he wrote from the space 
station, Culbertson said: ‘I zipped around the station until I found a 
window that would give me a view of NYC and grabbed the nearest camera.

Moved: Culbertson spoke of his horror at seeing 'wounds pouring from his country'

He then watched as plumes of smoke rose from the areas of Manhattan and Washington, DC.

Culbertson wrote: 'The smoke seemed to have an odd bloom to it at the base of the column that was streaming south of the city.

'I believe we were looking at NY around the time of, or shortly after, the collapse of the second tower. How horrible...'

Nasa was asked to monitor the area above Manhattan after the Twin Towers came down and its satellite photographs the smoke rising from Ground Zero the following day.

Culbertson also wrote of his anguish at being separated from his friends and family at such a tragic time, and the loneliness he felt.

He said: 'Other than the emotional impact of our country being attacked and thousands of our citizens and maybe some friends being killed, the most overwhelming feeling being where I am is one of isolation.'

He added: ‘It's difficult to describe how it feels to be the only American completely off the planet at a time such as this. The feeling that I should be there with all of you, dealing with this, helping in some way, is overwhelming.'

The International Space Station travels at about 17,000mph, which means it orbits the Earth 15 times a day.

But even as he sped high above the planet, Culbertson could tell that it was shaken to its core.

He wrote: 'Obviously the world changed today.

'What I say or do is very minor compared to the significance of what happened to our country today when it was attacked by …. by whom? Terrorists is all we know, I guess.'

Adding to the tragedy of that day, he later found out that Charles Burlingame III, who had graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with Culbertson was the pilot of American Airlines Flight 77 before it was taken over by terrorists and flown into the Pentagon.

Culbertson, who flew in two shuttle missions prior to his arrival at the International Space Station, returned to Earth in December 2001, and has since retired.

Nasa monitored the site of the attack: This image was taken by the Landsat 7 satellite on September 12. Smoke can clearly be seen streaming away from Ground Zero

The view just hours after the attack: This image came from Nasa's Terra satellite and shows a large plume of smoke streaming southward from the remnants of the burning World Trade Towers
