This was very nearly a victory for organisation and character in the face of stacked odds that would have left Hull on maximum points and seen Stoke’s stutter continue.

Instead, Steve Bruce was left livid at an incorrectly awarded throw-in that developed into Ryan Shawcross’s scruffy late equaliser, denying a side who had spent 76 minutes playing with 10 men full reward for their endeavours.

Goal-line technology was required to rule that the Stoke defender’s stab from two yards should count, but Bruce railed against an old-fashioned officiating error in the seconds beforehand. As part of his criticism he made a call for replays to be used more widely than just in the act of scoring.

Booked: Bardsley, Krkic, Diouf 

Referee: Jon Moss

Referee Jon Moss failed to spot a hefty deflection off Erik Pieters as Hull cleared their lines seven minutes from time and as Bruce protested, Bojan Krkic acted quickly, curling over a cross that found Phil Bardsley at the far post.

He thumped a shot into the turf and on to a post and the ball ricocheted off Allan McGregor to the feet of Shawcross, who got just enough on it to claim Stoke’s first goal and point of the season. There was a delay as Moss’s watch failed to buzz immediately but the correct call was made in the end.

It was a cruel way for the rug to be pulled out beneath the feet of players who had stood admirably firm since James Chester was sent off in the 14th minute for bringing down Glenn Whelan as the last man.

Bruce switched his team from a 3-5-2 to a 4-4-1 and shortly before half-time Nikica Jelavic’s predatory instincts earned Hull an unlikely goal that nearly saw them follow up their 1-0 win at Queens Park Rangers on the opening weekend with the same score at the KC Stadium.

‘Given the circumstances you would accept a point being down to 10 men after 15 minutes,’ said Bruce. ‘However, we feel an injustice. It wasn’t just a slight deflection. The consequence was we weren’t set up the way we would have been. We all thought it was our throw-in.

‘Let’s give them (officials) a hand. There should be a big monitor next to us where the fourth official can say, “Hang on, you got that wrong”.’

Manager Mark Hughes acknowledged that his team, who failed to make the most of their advantage and fashioned scarce few chances, had got lucky.

‘We needed to show quality and guile and use our intelligence to know what was required,’ he said. ‘We didn’t do that to a great extent in the second half. So credit to Hull.’ Only four days ago, Hull suffered defeat in their Europa League tie at Lokeren because of a defensive error from McGregor. Another mistake at the back proved costly here.

A dangerous ball from Paul McShane rushed Jake Livermore into a pass back to Chester but when Whelan got the first touch his foul was always going to result in a red card.

Saviour: Shawcross saved the day by scoring with seven minutes to go against Hull City

Jon Moss got his first big decision right with the 14th-minute dismissal of Hull’s James Chester. Replays confirmed Chester had stopped a goalscoring opportunity with no defender covering.

Stoke equalised when technology confirmed the ball had crossed the line, although it was strange Moss took so long to give a goal.

Hull were rightly aggrieved about the throw-in awarded to Stoke in the build-up.

Stoke took charge of possession yet for all the neat interchanges around the fringes of the box, they failed to create much of significance. Mame Biram Diouf looked awkward.

Bojan was sent on in the 41st minute to affect things but his first involvement saw Hull open the scoring. Tom Huddlestone, excellent throughout, brushed aside the former Barcelona prodigy and struck a pinpoint left-footed shot from the edge of the area that would have gone in without Asmir Begovic’s intervention.

But the Stoke goalkeeper could only parry to Jelavic, who took advantage of some slack marking by Marc Wilson to slide the ball home.

Hull were pretty comfortable after that, even when Peter Crouch arrived to provide variety. His shot after a breakaway bounced off McShane to Diouf in the area but the striker sent his header harmlessly wide.

It was left for Shawcross to show how it should be done and Bruce revealed that Hull are close to bringing in a defender of their own. A deal is agreed ‘in principle’ with Tottenham for Michael Dawson, he said, but added that a potential £12million move for Jordan Rhodes ‘seems further away than ever’.
