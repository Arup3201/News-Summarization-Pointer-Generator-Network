A massive increase in antibiotic prescriptions is being fuelled by out-of-hours GPs – with potentially fatal consequences, experts claim.

The number handed out by doctors covering nights and weekends has increased by up to a third since 2010.

Health experts say locums filling these shifts – as well as dentists and walk-in centres – do not know patients and are more inclined to hand out antibiotics as a quick fix.

Number of antibiotics prescribed by doctors on nights and weekends has increased by up to a third since 2010

Overall, the number of antibiotics prescribed by GPs, hospitals, dentists and out of hours clinics has risen by 6 per cent in four years.

This is despite repeated attempts by the NHS to bring the figure down over fears that over-prescribing is creating strains of drug-resistant bacteria, making many illnesses effectively untreatable – including potentially deadly ones.

Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies has warned that the threat is 'as big as terrorism' and could lead to minor scratches becoming fatal.

It has been caused by over-prescribing antibiotics – meant for bacterial illnesses, even for coughs and colds, which are caused by viruses and are unaffected by the drugs.

Scientists have warned that E. coli, a frequent cause of infection, is becoming resistant to antibiotics

Bacteria have gradually become more resistant and a growing number cannot be eradicated by common treatments.

In the first study of its kind, Public Health England looked at prescriptions for antibiotics in hospitals, GP surgeries, out-of-hours clinics and dentists.

Since 2010, the numbers have risen by 6 per cent, from 25.9 doses per day for every 1,000 people to 27.4 doses. This is 28 per cent higher than the European average of 21.3 doses per 1,000 people.

Previously, GPs have been blamed for handing out drugs too freely under pressure from demanding patients who expect to be given some sort of medication.

But this report shows the number given by family doctors fell last year by 3.5 per cent to 21.5 doses per day. Those from out-of-hours doctors, walk-in centres and dentists has risen by 32 per cent since 2010.

Dr Susan Hopkins, the epidemiologist behind the report, said: 'GPs know patients and they're able to give a back-up prescription so they don't immediately go and fill it – they only take it if they get worse over the next few days.

'It's a really good measure of reducing prescribing. Urgent-care centres don't know that patient.'

Her study is the first to look at the issue across the NHS. It also found that the number of prescriptions handed out in hospitals had increased by 12 per cent.

Professor John Watson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: 'Anti-microbial resistance is one of the biggest threats to health security facing the world today.'
