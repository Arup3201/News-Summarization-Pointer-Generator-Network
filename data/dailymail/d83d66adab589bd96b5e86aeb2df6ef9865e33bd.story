A quick-thinking six-year-old Utah boy saved his friend from being attacked by a pit bull.

Vincent Barrick saved friend Juan Argumedo, also six-years-old, from certain doom by grabbing on the collar of the vicious mutt until their screaming caused startled adults to run and help.

The two boys came in contact with the dog while cutting through a neighbor’s yard as they had often done in the past, family members told KUTV.

Innocent victim: Juan Argumedo was viciously attacked by the pit bull, but saved by friend Vincent Barrick

‘We heard some screaming, blood-curdling screams,’ proud grandfather Kevin Barrick said.

He ran through his St. George backyard towards the commotion and saw his tiny grandson pulling back the huge dog while another young boy was trapped underneath.

‘I could see Vincent standing there holding up on the dog's collar, pulling, almost standing on his tippy toes, pulling as hard as he could,’ said the family patriarch.

Kevin Barrick did not realize the extent of the Mr Argumendo’s injuries until he too tried to pull the cruel canine off him young boy.

Bad dog!: This is the pit bull that attacked an innocent young boy

‘Juan was being pulled up with him,’ said the grandfather. ‘He still had a hold of Juan's face.’

Kevin Barrick punched the dog in the face, causing it to run away, but the real horror didn’t set in until paramedics arrived – the dog had torn the flesh off the innocent boy’s leg all the way to the bone.

‘When they cut his shorts off from him and revealed his leg his mom about passed out and the paramedics said 'oh, good Lord,’ Kevin Barrick told the station.

The innocent child also suffered puncture wounds to his chest, face and head as well.

The victim’s father is upset his son spent hours in surgery, and will require several more procedures, but is also grateful that young Vincent Barrick didn’t back down from the malicious mutt.

Where it all went down: This is the backyard Vincent Barrick ran through to help his grandson pull the blood-thirsty bully off Mr Argumendo

‘We got lucky that Vincent made that decision,’ the father told the station.

The blood-thirsty pit bull is under a mandatory 10-day quarantine, KUTV reported. It is not clear what it’s ultimate fate will be.

Both adults agree the attack could have been deadly had the brave young boy not acted.

‘My grandson said that the dog kept trying to drag Juan underneath the motor home,’ Kevin Barrick explained. ‘If he could have got Juan there he would have shook him back and forth like a rag doll and shredded him.’

Luckily for everyone, Vincent Barrick is a hero.
