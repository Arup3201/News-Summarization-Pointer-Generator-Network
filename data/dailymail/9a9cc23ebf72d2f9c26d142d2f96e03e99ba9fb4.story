A new campaign has been launched to make Halloween safer for children with food allergies.

The Teal Pumpkin Project, organized by FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education), encourages people to offer trick-or-treaters small toys rather than candy, which may contain milk, nuts and other potentially harmful ingredients.

Participants are asked to paint a pumpkin teal and place it in front of their house to indicate that they're providing non-edible treats.

'Food allergies are potentially life-threatening,' FARE spokeswoman Veronica LaFemina told Today.com, adding that one in 13 children in the Unites States has one.

'When we are looking at a Halloween celebration, it is really nice to provide something that is safe,' she said. 

The organization's website suggests giving out bouncy balls, stickers, coins, playing cards, crayons, noisemakers, glow sticks or pencils.

The guidelines also advise Halloween hosts to check ingredients, as allergens can be found in some non-food items - for example Play-Doh, which contains wheat.

The Food Allergy Community of East Tennessee came up with the idea last year, before FARE took it nationwide.

Teal was used because it's the color of food allergy awareness, according to the organization's website.

Fun for everyone: 'That moment when you see a child get to have a treat that they don’t have to trade out or give away is really something special,' FARE spokeswoman Veronica LaFemina said

Ms LaFemina told ABC News that she expects the campaign to have a big impact for young allergy sufferers.

'That moment when you see a child get to have a treat that they don’t have to trade out or give away is really something special,' she said.
