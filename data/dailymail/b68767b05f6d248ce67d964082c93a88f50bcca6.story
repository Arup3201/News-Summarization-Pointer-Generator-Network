It is a tale of sheer determination in the face of almost unbelievable adversity - a mountain climber left for dead after breaking his leg and tumbling into a crevasse.

Few who have read Joe Simpson's brilliant book Touching the Void, or seen the 2003 documentary of the same name, remain unmoved by the author's bravery and incredible will to survive.  

But the 1988 work appears to have struck an entirely different chord with dozens of teenagers tasked with studying it for their GCSE English literature exams.

Survivor: Climber Joe Simpson hit back at GCSE students who bombarded his Twitter page with offensive posts about having to study his 1988 book Touching the Void

Decisively unimpressed with his gripping first-person account, the students took to Twitter, branding  Simpson a 'Crevasse W*****' and blaming him for failing their exams.

But as fans of the author know only too well, he isn't the type to take things lying down, and he hit back with a series of tweets describing the sulking students as 'loathsome scroats'. 

Gripping: Simpson's incredible tale of survival has become part of mountaineering folklore

The hilarious exchanges have quickly became an internet sensation with Simpson gaining thousands of new followers in the space of a few days 

One angry student had tweeted: 'Your book is the reason my entire year will fail our English exam!! Learn to write you illiterate fool.'

Another ranted: 'You seem like a nice chap, but why the f*** did you have to write that book?'

To which Simpson replied: 'To p*** you off.'

One of the most lively exchanges was with Turkish student Orkun Kurtduman who tweeted: ‘hi joe! i wrote you a few months ago. i said i had an exam about your book. i failed because of you. you owe to me!

To which Simpson replied:'Nope, you’re just crap at English.'

But the student hit back writing: 'i am a student who learn english; but you are a stupid who fell down on the mountain.'

Another student wrote: 'Your book is s*** and you should feel bad.'

And another fumed: 'Three chapters of crawling didn't inspire me to write about your book in my exam. It was rather boring really.'

Not all the students were as unimpressed with one writing: 'I really enjoyed the book, I think I did well in my english lit GCSE because of you :) thanks'

But by Wednesday night the author appeared to be getting more than a little hacked off: 'A lovely day of children writhing in their hellish hormonal middens … good night vile innocents may you all seethe in bilious acid pus ...'

And yesterday he declared: 'Ok bored of this now so I’ll either stop twitter or block all school kids – shame on the good ones – but the loathsome scroats can sod off!'

Abuse: Some of the posts between Joe and the GCSE students

Mr Simpson told Mail Online that he had found the whole incident rather funny.

He said: 'I suppose I deserve all the abuse I get. But I did find the term Crevasse W***** quite amusing.

'Every year when it gets to around exam time I start getting these abusive tweets. The funniest thing is that most of them have obviously only watched the film and not even bothered to read the book.

'I like using Twitter to talk to like-minded people but it's got to the point I'm having to block every child who tweets me.

'At first I thought it was a great honour to have the book used as a GCSE text but now it's becoming a pain in the backside.'

In 1985, Joe Simpson and friend Simon Yates set out to climb the treacherous west face of the Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes.

The already challenging ascent was beset with difficulties from the start as the climbers found themselves in a fierce storm and forced to tackle dangerous formations of soft powder snow.

Nevertheless they successfully reached the 21,000 ft summit on the third day.

But as they began to make their way down disaster struck; Joe slipped down an ice cliff smashing his knee and breaking his right leg.

With no fuel left for their stoves the two men were unable to make any drinking water and with darkness drawing in they needed to climb down a further 3000ft to their base camp fast.

Yates attempted to lower Simpson down the mountain by tying two lengths of rope together. But in the poor conditions he accidentally lowered him off a cliff.

They found themselves in a terrifying predicament with Yates unable to see or hear Simpson or pull him back up and Simpson too weak and frostbitten to climb up the rope himself.

After remaining in this deadlocked position for a while, it became obvious to Yates that the attachments holding him to the mountain would soon give way. If that happened they would both be pulled to their deaths.

Yates was faced with the awful decision - either die on the mountain or sacrifice his friend in order to save his own life. He had no choice but to cut the rope causing Simpson to plunged 150ft into a deep crevasse.

Incredibly, despite his broken leg, Simpson survived, landing on a small ledge inside the crevasse.

When Yates reached the entrance to the crevasse he called out for his friend but, on hearing no reply, was forced to assume that he had died.

Simpson eventually regained consciousness. He saw the rope had been cut and realised Yates would have presumed he had dead.

Freezing, injured and alone somehow Simpson managed to abseil onto a thin ice roof a short way down the crevasse. From there he managed to climb back up to the glacier via a steep snow slope.

But his ordeal had only really begun. From there he was forced to spend three days with no food and virtually no water, crawling hopping and clawing his way the five miles back to their base camp.

Incredibly he made it back to the tents a matter of hours before Yates had planned to head back.

His story has since become mountaineering folklore.
