John Terry celebrated Chelsea's 1-0 win at Sporting Lisbon by spending the day shopping in London with his wife Toni on Wednesday.

The Blues captain took her out to Bond Street store Smythson where the pair lavishly indulged themselves.

The duo's shopping spree was so vast that staff were required to take their bags to their taxi.

Terry captained Chelsea in Portugal on Tuesday night which saw Nemanja Matic first half header prove the difference between the two teams.

The match at the Estadio Jose Alvalade saw the 33-year-old also reach a personal milestone of 100 Champions League appearances.

He became only the sixth Englishman to hit this figure and on making a century of games in the competition Terry told SkySports: 'I'm very proud, there's not too many players to achieve that.'

Blues boss Jose Mourinho was quick to praise his captain on achieving the feat adding: 'The club of 100 is a limited group. Only very few people can play 100 games in the CL for the same club.'

'He may not have been captain in all those games, but surely in most of them. He's an historic player and will go down in the history of the club.'

Chelsea sit top of Group G with four points after two games and play Maribor at home next on October 21.
