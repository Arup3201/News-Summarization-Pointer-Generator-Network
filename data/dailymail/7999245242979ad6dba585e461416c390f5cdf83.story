Five years ago Southampton were in the League One relegation zone, had been deducted 10 points and were selling tickets to students for £3.

It was a club which had been on the verge of bankruptcy and was crashing towards oblivion until they were bought by Markus Liebherr who turned them around.

Their rise up the football pyramid, now sitting second in the Barclays Premier League, has been one of the swiftest in English football.

Ronald Koeman has guided Southampton to second place in the Premier League so far this season

Sandwiched between current champions Manchester City and Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, the name Southampton is still an unusual sight.

However, this is not entirely new territory for fans of the south coast club, who sat third in the table after 11 games last season.

But it was at this exact stage that reality kicked in and three successive defeats against Arsenal, Chelsea and Aston Villa started a run of six in a row without victory.

With manager Ronald Koeman – whose managerial brilliance rebuilt a severely wounded side bereft of its stars – now talking of a top four finish and those elusive Champions League places as a possibility, the Christmas period will be the true test of their credentials.

'I’m not looking too much at the rest of the teams,' Koeman said after their win against Leicester on Saturday. 'Maybe only in the aspect that I think that I haven’t seen until now teams much better than Southampton. A top-four finish would be fantastic.'

From the end of November until the start of the new year they face City and Chelsea and also twice come up against Arsenal and Manchester United.

After a slow start to his Saints career, Shane Long scored both goals in Southampton's 2-0 win over Leicester

They have won 11 times this season, but Liverpool and Tottenham were their only defeats, suggesting the bigger clubs might cause them problems.

Southampton have filled the top flight with some of its biggest names at some of the biggest clubs. 

Luke Shaw at Manchester United, Calum Chambers at Arsenal, Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert at Liverpool and their former manager Mauricio Pochettino now in charge at Spurs.

But at the moment it is Southampton – and 'the Southampton way' philosophy by which the club runs – who top them all.

Their replacements have been some of the buys of the summer – striker Graziano Pelle has fired in 10 goals, forward Dusan Tadic has more than filled Lallana's boots and Toby Alderweireld and Ryan Bertrand have shored up the defence.

Until the weekend, new recruit Shane Long was playing in the others' shadows until his double downed Leicester.

'It has kind of been on us as a team with so many players leaving and so many players coming in and everyone expecting us to have a bad season,' Long said. 'Second in the league takes some doing and we’re very proud of that.'
