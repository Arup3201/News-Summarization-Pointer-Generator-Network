As one of the most powerful brands in the world and a byword for cool, Apple has become known for its minimalist billboards and ads.

But it wasn’t always the case: in the 70s and 80s Apple was a plucky upstart to Microsoft’s dominance, and had to use the power of advertising to get noticed.

From the pre-iconic logo Apple-1 computer built by Steve Jobs in his parents’ basement in 1976 to the first colourful iMac in 1998, their adverts have evolved in line with the machinery.

Apple's first ad: In July 1976, Apple promised 'A balance of features' for the Apple-1 computer, which boasted 4k of RAM and a cassette interface

The company’s early forays into advertising appear to be less than eye-catching - a dreary sepia advert consisting largely of text proclaims the $666.66 Apple-1 has a 'balance of features'.

The thinking has changed by the time the Apple II comes along a year later - for which the company chose a simple shot of a housewife tending the kitchen, looking dotingly on her husband who sits working on the computer at the kitchen table.

The Apple II ad is a more minimalist attempt, just showing the machine being used with its name

This is followed by the first advert including the now iconic logo against a backdrop of a red apple and a computer.

It reads: 'A is for Apple: It’s the first thing you know about personal computers.'

Later adverts for the Apple II show signs of Apple’s simple ethos and design philosophy.

One featuring an apple against a white backdrop reads: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Introducing the Apple II personal computer.'

The multicoloured logo first used by Apple was the star of this ad

The Apple II was designed to look like a home computer rather than a piece of electronic hardware, and this was reflected in some of its adverts.

Another inventive and cheeky campaign featured a naked man standing infront of a forest - mirroring Adam in the Garden of Eden - whose blushes are spared by the judicious positioning of a computer.

The tag line reads: 'We’re looking for the most original use of an Apple since Adam'.

The competition invited people to send in their stories of how they used their Apple computer.

The firm ran a contest to find out what its users were doing with their Apple II via this advert in 1980

Apple also produced its own guide to choosing a computer to help consumers, many of whom where still confused about what the machines could do, make up their mind

It was Apple’s adverts in the 1980s that first forged its link with the student market.

On directly targeting students featured an image of youngsters using their computers in a classroom, pronouncing it the 'educational computer'.

Others highlighted its appeal to creative types, in contrast to the more business-like approach of its competitors.

It used a series of adverts featuring Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Thomas Jefferson, sending the message that buying an Apple would equip the user with similar powers of intellect.

One, showing Jefferson superimposed next to an Apple, reads: 'Jefferson had one of the best minds of 1776, but today you can make better decisions with an Apple.'

Even in its early days, Apple ads focused on simplicity, showing just the product and a catchline

A later advert emphasises the individuality of Apple users.

Against a picture of a hand pulling a computer screen from a bag it says: 'Of the 235 million people in America, only a fraction can use a computer.'

In the 1990s, Apple began to branch out and advertise some of its other products including its laptops, software packages and its Newton handheld.

In the 1990s Apple began advertising a wider range of products, including the ill-fated Newton handheld machine which was a precursor to today's iPad

Apple also began advertising its portable machines, which were based on the iMac's translucent design

After the original Apple and the Apple Macintonsh came the brightly coloured iMac, with its stripped down advertising.

One advert next to the computer says: 'Chic. Not geek.'

Another at a similar time, pulled in a celebrity endorsement of Muhammad Ali and its now well-known slogan 'think different'.

A later minimalist advert of a laptop against a white background carried the tag: 'Black tie optional'.
