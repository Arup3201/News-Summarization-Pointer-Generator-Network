The 2015 World Darts Championship is almost upon us with the festive fun set to commence at the Alexandra Palace in London on Thursday.

Michael van Gerwen begins his defence of the title he won last year, but the likes of Phil Taylor, Adrian Lewis and Gary Anderson are all hungry to wrestle the Sid Waddell Trophy away from the Dutchman.

Twenty sessions of top tungsten spread over a 17-day period over Christmas and New Year will decide who is the best darts player on the planet, and here is our guide to the big tournament.

THE MAIN CONTENDERS 

Michael van Gerwen

The reigning world champion and No 1 seed for this year's tournament, Van Gerwen is among the favourites to win the title again. Having been beaten by Taylor in the 2013 final, the Dutchman bounced back in 2014 to beat Peter Wright and lift the Sid Waddell Trophy. Van Gerwen has won the World Grand Prix and European Championship this year, and begins his title defence against Joe Cullen on the opening night at Alexandra Palace.

Phil Taylor

What more needs to be said about The Power than the fact he is a 16-time world champion? Taylor has accomplished everything in the game of darts and has nothing to prove. Taylor is the pre-tournament favourite at Alexandra Palace, and he begins his quest on Friday night against German Jyhan Artut. 

Taylor has had some personal issues to deal with leading up to the tournament with his mum Liz suffering from a lung infection. It remains to be seen how much his mum's illness affects his performance at Ally Pally.

Adrian Lewis

Jackpot is a two-time world champion having won the title in both 2011 and 2012. But on both occasions since then, Lewis has run into a red-hot Van Gerwen, losing 5-4 in a thrilling quarter-final in 2013 and 6-0 in the semi-final 12 months ago. 

Lewis enters the tournament as the No 3 seed and opens his campaign against David Pallett. It's a tricky section of the draw he finds himself in, though, with potential matches with Raymond van Barneveld and Taylor on the way to the final.

Gary Anderson

The Flying Scotsman has enjoyed a resurgence this year, entering the World Championship as the No 4 seed on the back of his win at the Players Championship, his first appearance in a premier event final for three years.

Anderson took Ally Pally by storm in 2011 with his stunning scoring but came up short in the final, losing 7-5 to Lewis. But Anderson's life turned upside down soon after that when he lost both his brother Stuart and father Gordon in a short space of time. Anderson admitted that times were tough, but he seems to be back to his best on the oche now.

Adrian Lewis won back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012, but has been beaten by Van Gerwen both times since

Gary Anderson is returning to his best form this year and is one of the favourites for the title

Peter Wright

Having never previously been past the third round at the World Darts Championship, Wright produced a remarkable run all the way to the final in 2014. The man known as 'Snakebite' was eventually beaten by Van Gerwen in the final, but he won many admirers, not least for his extravagant hair styles and dress sense.

James Wade

Wade has won all there is to win in darts, apart from the world title. He has never even appeared in the final at Alexandra Palace, twice losing in the semi-finals. Wade may never get a better chance at the title than in 2012, when he was 5-1 up in the semi-final against Lewis and somehow lost 6-5. Still, his experience and performances this year make it hard to exclude him from the list of contenders for the title. Should he get past Jamie Lewis in the first round, a potential second-round clash with BDO world champion Stephen Bunting could await him.

James Wade has won every major trophy in the PDC apart from the World Championship

Stephen Bunting

The winner of the BDO title last year makes his debut in the PDC version of the world championship this year. He made the switch from the BDO to the PDC in January and produced solid, if not spectacular, results, including making the semi-finals of the World Grand Prix and the German Masters. Bunting is the sixth favourite for the tournament, as his lowly No 27 seeding means he could be facing No 6 seed Wade in the second round.

Stephen Bunting will make his debut at Alexandra Palace having won the BDO world title last year

Raymond van Barneveld

It has been a long time since Barney produced his best at the World Championship. Since winning the 2007 world title, the best Van Barneveld has managed is a final appearance in 2009 and semi-final defeats in 2010 and 2013. Barney is seeded as low as 14, which means a potential third-round clash with Lewis awaits him. But if the Premier League champion finds his groove at the oche, he will be a tough man to beat.

Raymond van Barneveld won the Premier League earlier this year and is looking for a sixth world title
