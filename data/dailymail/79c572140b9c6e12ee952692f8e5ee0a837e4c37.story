A football fan ended up in intensive care after suffering an allergic reaction to his post-match doner kebab.

Ben Eason, 20, suffered an allergic reaction to the greasy takeaway that was so bad he was left choking and paramedics had to restart his heart with adrenaline.

He was in a critical condition in intensive care for three days after. And worst of all, his team lost.

Intensive care: Ben Eason in hospital after suffering an allergic reaction to a doner kebab

Mr Eason, a fan of Fulham FC, had decided to go for his favourite lamb doner after watching his team concede two goals in the dying moments to lose 2-1 away at Brentford.

The insurance worker, who is in fact from Hastings, East Sussex, tucked into his kebab after sinking a few pints in Fulham, south west London, with friends following the November 21 defeat.

'I hadn't eaten anything all day, so I was starving,' he told South West News Service.

'I ate it pretty quickly. I got doner kebabs all the time and have never had a problem with them before.

'All of a sudden I couldn't breathe - I thought I was having an asthma attack.

'My mate ran to get me a bottle of water, but by the time he got back I had collapsed and they had to call 999.

'The paramedics had to use adrenaline to restart my heart - if they had got stuck in traffic on their way to see me, I would have died.'

Goner kebab: A succulent doner kebab life the one Mr Eason, right, ate before his allergic reaction. He thinks there must have been some peanut residue on the kebab - the first he had ever bought from that takeaway

Mr Eason has spent his life knowing he has a potentially lethal peanuts allergy. He thinks there must have been some residue on the kebab - the first he had ever bought from that takeaway in Fulham.

'They took me to Charing Cross Hospital. I was in critical care for three days and then I was fine,' he said.

'Even the tiniest bit of peanut could set me off - I had my epi pen but it didn't look like an allergic reaction so we didn't use it.

'The whole situation was very scary, and it was a terrible end to a rubbish day out at the football.

'I'm definitely never eating a kebab again, but of course I will still go and watch Fulham.'
