The extraordinary number of football players suffering from brain damage has rocked the NFL - but the league's boss is worried that the scandal could go even further.

Commissioner Roger Goodell has apparently admitted that a player could die in the middle of the game, and is 'terrified' that such an incident could wreck the sport's reputation for ever.

The NFL chief is now working with players, team owners and even the Army in a desperate attempt to improve the league's safety record before tragedy strikes.

Fears: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is said to be worried about the prospect of a player dying on field

Since taking over as NFL commissioner in 2006, Mr Goodell has worked to improve the league's reputation in this regard, introducing new regulations and harshly punishing the New Orleans Saints over their 'bounty' programme.

A profile of the 54-year-old in ESPN The Magazine reveals that he is nonetheless haunted by the prospect of a player dying on the field thanks to a head injury.

'He's terrified of it,' a former player who knows Mr Goodell told the magazine. 'It wouldn't just be a tragedy. It would be awfully bad for business.'

While football has always been a 
violent and potentially dangerous game, the issue of player safety in 
both the short and long term has recently come to the fore.

A
number of former players, including Dave Duerson, Junior Seau and Ray 
Easterling, have committed suicide over the past four years after 
sustaining repeated concussions throughout their careers.

Chuck Hughes is the only NFL player to have died during a game - he collapsed on the field with a heart attack while playing for the Detroit Lions in 1971.

Many athletes in other sports have died while playing, notably soccer player Marc-Vivien Fo√© who collapsed and died during a game for Cameroon in 2003.

NFL officials including Mr Goodell have often tried to downplay the dangers of their sport, though they have simultaneously worked hard behind the scenes to make it safer.

The league has been working with the U.S. Army in an attempt to record players' concussions better, according to ESPN, and could adopt military technology embedded in soldiers' helmets which gathers data on every concussion sustained.

Mr Goodell has received praise from NFL team owners - who collectively employ him and pay him nearly $30million a season.

New York Giants boss John Mara said: 'Player safety is Roger's number one priority. It's something, quite frankly, that he wants as part of his legacy as a commissioner.'

But others are more sceptical - lawyer Peter Ginsberg claimed that the commissioner 'doesn't view individual players as anything more than commodities for the business'.

DeMaurice Smith, head of the NFL Players Association, who has often clashed with Mr Goodell, even accused him of endangering players by pushing to expand the season to 18 games.

'It is diabolically brilliant,' he told ESPN. 'It also happens to be completely inconsistent with health and safety.'
