Motorists driving along a busy  highway in Brazil were shocked to see a horse being ferried in a two-door car with its head poking out of the window.

The bizarre scene was captured on video in Fortaleza on Thursday by an astonished driver who first thought the animal was a very large Great Dane.

'I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,' said Evi Braga. 'The horse was sitting on the backseat of the car as if it was a dog.

Bizarre: The horse was seen peering out of the window of a car in Fortaleza in the north west of Brazil 

'It scared me when I realised it was a horse. It looked fully grown and seemed to be enjoying the drive. It pushed its head out of the passenger’s front car window and didn’t look stressed at being squashed into such a small space.

'I drove alongside the vehicle and the driver didn’t even glance over at me to acknowledge he was doing anything wrong.

'The incredible thing was I couldn’t figure out how the owner got the horse into the car in the first place,' she added in amazement.

The animal was being driven in a run-down two-door Ford Del Rey, manufactured by the Ford Motor Company in Brazil between 1981 and 1991.

According to Brazil’s Federal Highway Police animals should be transported in a box or strapped in with a car seatbelt - something which would have been impossible to do with the horse.

Braga added: 'It was at least 30 degrees on Thursday so it must have been really hot and smelly inside the vehicle. I wanted to laugh but I also felt more sorry for the horse.'

Shocked: The driver of the other car initially thought the animal was a Great Dane 

Passenger: The horse appeared to stick its head out of the window as the other car approached 

There is no legislation in Brazil banning motorists from carrying an array of animals in their vehicles.

A traffic cop said: 'The Brazilian Traffic Code states that if the driver is caught with animals on the seat in the front of the car, or between their arms or legs they face four penalty points on their licence and a fine of £25.

He added: 'Besides putting their own life at risk they endanger the lives of others on the road. Unfortunately we didn’t catch this incident on our motorway cameras, if we had the offender would have been stopped immediately.'

He admitted however, that over the years officers have logged all types of creatures being carried in domestic vehicles including sheep, goats, birds and snakes.

Normal: There was nothing unusual about the vehicle as the other car approached
