There's no time to rest about in your nappies in the 21st century, especially when you’re third in line to the throne.

So like his father before him, Prince George of Cambridge is already being readied for a trip to Australia.

The youngster’s inaugural royal tour abroad was revealed by William yesterday as he spoke about his ‘very good looking’ son and family plans for the future.

Prince William took part in a falconry display at the Anglesey Show, which is thought to be one of his last visit to the North Wales area he once called home

The show is just a few miles from the home he shares with wife Catherine and new son Prince George and also his place of work, RAF Valley

William's visit to the Anglesey Show, a vast two-day agricultural event in North Wales that attracts almost 60,000 people, was his first official engagement since his son's birth

Chatting: Prince William talks to seven-year-old David Oultram and his calf at the Anglesey Show yesterday

Currently in Anglesey, he and Kate are expected shortly to return to London to make their home at Kensington Palace.

'I know 
that both of us will miss it [Anglesey] terribly when my Search and Rescue tour of 
duty comes to an end next month and we have to move elsewhere'

Prince William

Speaking at the Anglesey Show, his 
first official engagement since George’s birth on July 22, William said 
the couple were hoping to make a trip Down Under to introduce the tiny 
future king to his family realm.

He told Max and Maxine Davies – on 
holiday from near Adelaide: ‘George is doing really well, thank you. We 
are all very hopeful of coming to Australia next year.’

William’s late mother, Princess Diana,
broke royal tradition when she insisted on taking her nine-month-old 
son to Australia and New Zealand with her in 1983, on a six-week tour.

Speaking to Max and Maxine Davies, from Victor Habour near Adelaide, he 
said: 'George is doing really well, thank you. We are all very hopeful 
of coming to Australia next year

William's visit to the Anglesey Show, a vast two-day agricultural event in North Wales that attracts almost 60,000 people, was his first official engagement since his son's birth

William was keen to visit the show as a way of saying thank you to the island's people - and gave an emotional speech summing up their feelings

He also spoke about baby George's first few days, saying: 'Catherine is sorry that she cannot be here today at the County Show, but she and George would have loved to have been here'

In contrast the Queen was forced to 
leave Charles and Anne, then aged five and three, for six months when 
she embarked on a Commonwealth tour in 1953.

William has been based on Anglesey since January 2010, working as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley.

For the last two years he and Kate have shared an isolated rented farmhouse, relishing the privacy the island has afforded them.

But they are, reluctantly, having to 
leave when his posting ends early next month. Back in London, William is
expected to take up a post with the Household Cavalry.

Next stop was the falconry arena, where he even donned a protective leather glove to handle a Harris Hawk and a Common Buzzard

Media and guests look on as Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrives at Anglesey agricultural show on his first official engagement since the birth of his son Prince George of Cambridge

Yesterday's show featured a collection of livestock of up to 300 cattle and 800 sheep. There were also 350 trade stands featuring agricultural products, clothing, crafts and vehicles

It has been reported that William is unlikely to continue his duties with 22 Squadron in Anglesey for another deployment

The new father disclosed that he and wife, Kate, were planning to take their first baby Down Under for his inaugural foreign royal visit

The prince was keen to visit the 
Anglesey Show to say thank you to the island’s people and gave a speech 
which included some Welsh.

Talking about his son, William told his cheering audience: ‘He’s pretty loud but of course very good looking!’

He added: ‘I know that I speak for 
Catherine when I say that I have never known somewhere as beautiful and 
as welcoming as Anglesey. I know that both of us will miss it terribly.’

William also met grandmother Joan Roberts from nearby Caernarfon who asked him how George was doing.

‘Great. All we have got to do now is to get him to sleep through the night... please!’ he quipped.
