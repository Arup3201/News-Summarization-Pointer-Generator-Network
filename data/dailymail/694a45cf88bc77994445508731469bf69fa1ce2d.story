Jailed: Lawrence Wood, pictured, repeatedly stabbed a 12-year-old girl innocently playing out in the street because he decided he wanted to kill someone

A man repeatedly stabbed a 12-year-old girl innocently playing out in the street because he decided he wanted to kill someone, a court heard today.

Lawrence Wood, 31, later told police he had been surprised how easily the knife blade went into the youngster's back, describing it 'like slicing butter'.

The girl was playing in the street in Wigan, Greater Manchester, with her three-year-old brother when the horrific attack took place.

Liverpool Crown Court heard that stabbing the girl made Wood 'feel good' and so he did it again at a different part of her back.

Mark Ainsworth, prosecuting, told the court that following the attack, he walked off and 'thought about killing someone else and knocking on a nearby door to do so.'

But instead he waited in a nearby field for a few hours and then walked into Wigan police station with the knife and handed himself in.

'He went on to say he hoped that the girl had died. He wanted her father to be upset and he wanted people to know that he could not be messed with,' said Mr Ainsworth.

Wood, 31, explained he had money difficulties and wanted to go to prison. 'He said he could not cope any more and wanted an end to it.'

Liverpool Crown Court heard that Wood also said he 'felt nothing' about what he had done. He had said: 'I couldn’t care less about her.'

When Wood first appeared in court in May he replied, ‘turnips’ when the charge of attempted murder was put to him and the judge formally entered a not guilty plea.

However, today when his trial was due to start, Wood, of Marsh Green, Wigan, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Judge John Roberts ruled that Wood, who has no previous convictions and has refused to be examined by a psychiatrist, poses a serious danger to the public.

He said that a sentence of life imprisonment had to be imposed 'to reflect the public abhorrence of such grotesque crime involving a defenceless 12-year-old girl in the presence of her three-year-old brother.'

Judge Roberts told Wood, who showed no emotion, that he must serve 15 years before he can apply for parole but warned him that he may never be released.

The court heard that although the girl has recovered physically she has been left permanently scarred and she and her family have been badly psychologically affected.

Her mother stated that the family has 'undergone a complete change of life.' The victim’s personality has changed and she is withdrawn, her young brother has become aggressive and often makes stabbing actions and they are both awaiting counselling.

Mr Ainsworth had told the court that the incident happened about 4.10 pm on February 8 this year as the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was playing on her scooter outside her home.

'Wood grabbed her by her arm or shoulder. He did not say anything but she felt a pain and then she felt wetness to her back. He let go of her and as he started to walk off she saw he was holding a knife. It was seven and a half inches long including a blade of three and a half inches.

'She was seriously injured but nevertheless managed to run back to her house and banged on the door and when it was opened she said, “I’ve been stabbed.”'

She was taken by ambulance to Wigan Royal Infirmary where it was found she had two stab wounds to the left side of her back.

The higher one below her shoulder blade had punctured her lung and she needed a chest drain as it had collapsed. The lower wound was in her kidney area and she had to undergo surgery.

Her coat showed three stab marks consistent with a further unsuccessful attempt to stab her.

Mr Ainsworth said that Wood told police that the had no grudge against the victim though he did not like her older brother for bullying another boy and had fallen out with her father over drugs.

His father had refused to lend him £10 which 'made him angry so he decided to go out and kill someone. He said he had always wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone.'

His QC John McDermott told Liverpool Crown Court that Wood had repeatedly refused to have a psychiatric report prepared or any sort of evaluation. He said that there was no point asking for an adjournment for reports. 'He simply would not co-operate.'

He added that he had warned Wood about the likely sentence he would receive but he was adamant. 'It is an unusual but egregious case.'
