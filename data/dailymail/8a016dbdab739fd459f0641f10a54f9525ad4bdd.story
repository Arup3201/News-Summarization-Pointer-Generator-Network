Horrific: This 78-year-old pensioner was left completely unrecognisable after two teenagers battered him when he waved to indicate their car headlights were off

A pensioner was left completely unrecognisable after two teenagers battered him when he waved to indicate their car headlights were off.

Christopher Graney and Samantha Fenton, both 19, left their 78-year-old victim with severe bruising to his face after beating him at a bus stop.

The pair leapt out of their car, pushed the unnamed man over, then kicked and punched him as he lay defenceless on the ground.

They then jumped back in the vehicle 
and fled the scene, but were arrested a short while later at Fenton's 
home, in Bromley, Kent.

Fenton and Graney, of Beckenham, were both convicted of a 'shocking and cowardly' assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Croydon Crown Court.

The 78-year-old victim burst into tears when he was told of the guilty verdict by police.

On October 15 last year police were called to Widmore Road, Bromley, Kent at 12.05am. When they arrived they found an elderly man with severe bruising to his face.

The victim had been waiting for a bus when he saw a car travelling down Widmore Road at speed without any lights on.

He waved to attract the driver's attention, but the car suddenly braked sharply.

Graney and Fenton denied the offence throughout the trial, but were convicted by an 11-1 majority by a jury last Tuesday.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Rosmarie Lee, from Bromley CID, said: 'This was a shocking, unprovoked and cowardly attack on an elderly gentleman.

'The victim was left with appalling injuries and is still very upset - indeed he burst into tears when I told him that Graney and Fenton had been found guilty.'

Guilty: Christopher Graney, left and Samantha Fenton, right, beat the 78-year-old at a bus stop

The pair will be sentenced in April 9 at Croydon Crown Court.

Graney will also be sentenced for another assault he committed in the early hours of August 27, 2011, when a 28-year-old man was attacked on the forecourt of the Total petrol station in Croydon Road, Beckenham, and was left requiring hospital treatment for a head wound.

Graney was remanded in custody pending sentencing, while Fenton has been released on bail.
