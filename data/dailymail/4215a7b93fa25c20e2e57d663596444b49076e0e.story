Two of the three Florida men arrested for dressing as ninjas while pillaging a multimillion-dollar waterfront home are career criminals, and one claims to have been a member of the Gambino crime family.

Frank Bower, 54, Johnathan Contreras, 38, and Andres Perez, 45, are the main suspects in a daring home invasion last month caught on homeowner Bill Kitchen's surveillance video, but Bower's involvement is the one raising the most eyebrows.

The ordained minister who now runs a Florida drug and inmate rehabilitation center and claims he found God after a life of crime that he boasted made him millions at the top of the Florida mafia food chain now sits in an Orange County Jail cell.

A life of crime: Frank Bower is the subject of a 2011 book claiming he was a personal bodyguard to former Gambino crime family boss John Gotti before he turned his life around to become 'a servant of God'

The trio was brought into custody Monday night while trying to break into another luxury home while wearing all black clothing, police sources told First Coast News.

Investigators told WBBH that they darted onto the property after using wire cutters to break through a chain link fence ringing the property and were quickly busted.

They also had a stolen gun, pepper spray, duct tape and zip ties on them when hauled in after 'criminal intelligence information, [led] the Orange County Sheriff's Felony Unit... to conduct surveillance.'

Bower and Contreras surrendered without incident, but Perez barricaded himself behind a shrub and was eventually taken in with the support of a K9 unit, the station reported. He was treated for his injuries at a local hospital while deputies raided a nearby hotel room.

They found cash, clothing and cellphones, sources said.

Contreras has a robust criminal history with multiple drug convictions including trafficking in cocaine, records showed, but Bower's sordid past was the subject of the 2011 book 'The Incredible Journey of a Mafia Soldier.'

His rap sheet includes multiple assault and drug convictions and jail sentences, but the book telling his life story is far more colorful.

Bower boasts in the tome that he was 'Teflon Don' John Gotti's former bodyguard, and that his 'search for the true meaning of life' led him to be 'a faithful servant of God.'

The supposed one-time protector of America's most infamous mobster is shown in court records to have served multiple jail sentences for drug offenses, and said in a 2004 interview he also served time for killing a police officer, before finding God and opening a rehab center in rural Texas.

'Why does God call a guy like me to do something like this? I'm dealing with inmates that are getting out of prison,' he told KLTV a decade ago, adding that he suffered many tragedies as a boy including the kidnapping of two of his sisters and the drowning death of another.

'That's when the flip began. I was 14. That's when I kinda almost knew, I wanted to hurt people,' he continued. And he did, for many years, until he told the station he had enough.

'I think just one day it just hit me, I didn't want my kids to become what I'd become.'

He bragged in the book about being a body guard that somehow found his way to running all Gambino operations in Florida, and that he made millions in illicit profits - but that he turned his back on that quick money to live an honest life.

Now divorced and back living in Florida, it appears the allure of the quick score was too strong to overcome. He and his two accomplices are believed to have been involved in a string of similar robberies in the Orlando area.

A photo from the surveillance footage of their well publicized robbery last month shows Kitchen tied up in what appears to be a home office while one of the crooks wears one of Espinel’s hats.

‘Our home security shows me (hands bound behind me) in the office, pointing out the valuables. Camilo is sitting, also bound, with his head in a pillow case,’ Kitchen wrote Facebook.

‘One of the three robbers (in black Ninja suits) found Camilo's hat, and is wearing it. In the second pic, the robber sees the video camera.’

A MailOnline attempt to obtain a list of stolen items and the weapons used from Windermere Police was not successful.

‘We were asked to produce all money, jewelry and valuables,’ he wrote in the post. ‘For an hour they ransacked the house.’

The trio then made off in one a car owned by one of the bound men, Kitchen added.

‘It's very scary. I'm hoping that it was an isolated incident like they're saying it was and that it wasn't random and that we have nothing to worry about,’ neighbour DeeDee Lee told WKMG.

Police also have not said what make or model car was taken, but did note it was found nearby.

‘Although this is frightening to 
happen in our community, I believe this to be an isolated incident, said
 police chief David Ogden. Those initial assumptions have since been proven false, but authorities may have finally put an end to the crime spree.

Kitchen's home is worth just under $4.6million, according to Zillow. It was once owned by N'SYNC bandmember Joey Fatone, and was even featured in an episode of 'MTV Cribs' before Kitchen bought it.

He has not spoken publicly about the incident, but his son released a statement to WESH saying ‘he is holding up quite well considering the circumstances.’

Windermere is the exclusive community where golfer Tiger Woods and ex-wife Elin Nordegren once lived prior to their divorce.

Each suspect faces attempted armed robbery with a firearm and other related charges. They are being held without bail in Orange County Jail.

The investigation remains ongoing.
