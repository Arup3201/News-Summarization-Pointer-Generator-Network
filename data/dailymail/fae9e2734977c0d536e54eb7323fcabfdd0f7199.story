Manchester United are keen to continue their recent resurgence by picking up all three points against West Brom according to Spanish playmaker Juan Mata.

United won their last two games before the international break to climb the Premier League table after a difficult start to life under Louis van Gaal.

And Mata believes they can continue that form, despite the trip to The Hawthorns presenting a 'tough atmosphere' on Monday night.

'It's always a difficult stadium to go to with a tough atmosphere,' Mata told MUTV.

'After the international break and two weeks without a game we want another three points after two wins in a row.

'We'll try our best to come back to Manchester with all three. We only have to think about this game. The manager is only speaking about West Brom and that's the same for us.'

United's expensively assembled front-line is beginning to show its quality despite defensive frailties

'It wasn't easy to win both games, first with 10 players (against West Ham) and second with Everton attacking and attacking, but we did it and got six points.'

'Hopefully we will get three more points in the next game but it will be tough at West Brom.'
