Southampton have made a statement of intent that they will not lose all of their best players by offering Jay Rodriguez a new five-year contract.

The club have already lost three of their best players – Luke Shaw to Manchester United and Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert to Liverpool – but are determined to keep hold of there other stars.

Rodriguez still has two years to run on his current deal after signing a four-year contract when he joined the club in in June 2012.

Liverpool and Tottenham are both interested in the striker but Southampton have moved to convince him to stay.

Rodriguez scored 17 times last season and was on the verge of a call-up for England's World Cup squad until he was ruled out for the summer with a knee injury.

He is expected back in October and it is understood he is interested in returning to action for Southampton before considering his options in the January transfer window.
