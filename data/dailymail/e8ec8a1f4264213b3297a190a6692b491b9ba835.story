A female NASA astronaut has shared the hair-raising experience of getting a salon trim while floating through space.

In a video uploaded to Vine, Italian-born Samantha Cristoforetti, 37, is seen getting a wash and cut courtesy of commander Terry Virts.

As her short dark crop is trimmed into shape, she uses a small vacuum to prevent stray hairs from floating away and clogging filters.

She also clings tightly to a rail to ensure she maintains a steady position in the microgravity environment. 

An 'after' photograph of the salon session shows it was a success, with no strands out of place or chunks missing. 

Virts, 47, of Baltimore, Maryland, joked that he could be gearing up for a 'second career after astronaut'.

Out of this world: In a video uploaded to Vine, Italian-born Samantha Cristoforetti, 37, is seen getting a wash and cut courtesy of commander Terry Virts - the duo are currently on a six-month mission with Expedition 43 to the International Space Station

He and Cristoforetti are currently on a six-month mission with Expedition 43 to the International Space Station. They are set to return to Earth on May 14.

To date the clip of their hairdressing antics has been watched more than 50,000 times. Many fans have thanked them for sharing the behind-the-scenes footage.

It's not the first time Virts has cut Cristoforetti's hair. On January 1 he gave the flight engineer a trim to ring in the New Year, with photographs uploaded to Twitter.

Luckily her short hair is easy to manage but female astronauts with longer locks often find 'bad hair days' are part of the job.

In 2013, Karen Nyberg revealed how it was difficult to wash her long blonde hair in space.

The mechanical engineer was on board Expedition 36 to the International Space Station at the time.  

In a video uploaded to Twitter Ms Nyberg was seen placing water on to her scalp, battling with a few escaping bubbles.

She then worked leave-in shampoo through her hair. It was seen stood on its end as she worked a comb through it. 

Her tools were stuck to the wall beside her to prevent them from escaping. To finish, she towel-dried her head dry. She claimed the results left her barnet feeling 'squeaky clean'

For men, shaving is the same as it is on Earth. Although, again, they  use a vacuum device so that stray hairs do not to float away.

Elsewhere on the grooming front, astronauts have sponge baths instead of regular showers as water clings to the body instead of running down it in microgravity,

There is a limited supply of water on the International Space Station (ISS)  - no more than 4 liters per wash - so taking sponge baths also saves water.

In space, astronauts use a no-rinse shampoo to wash their hair, and apply the shampoo using a towel, vigorously rub their hair and scalp. They then use a towel to wipe their hair clean.

The reason for the vacuum is to make sure loose hairs don't float around the station.

'Astronauts must not let loose hairs fall off the towel because floating hairs can create a safety hazard since they can be inhaled or aggravate an astronauts' eyes,' explained the Canadian Space Agency.

'Loose hair can also clog filters and affect air circulation and filtration.'

Shaving in space is similar to shaving on Earth; astronauts just have to be careful not to let stray whiskers escape into the air, like with a haircut.

Astronauts shave with foam or an electric razor, but most are said to prefer the latter, because it doesn't require water and automatically collects hair.

And, no water is wasted, because as it dries on a person's head, it is collected by the air conditioning system, which turns it into condensate and then into drinking water.

Welcome to the space gym: Along with keeping her grooming in check, Cristoforetti also works out twice a day

Other Vine videos show her in the 'space gym' doing rowing pulls, shoulder presses and squats.

As their bodies are not working against the force of gravity, astronauts exert little effort to get around.

Therefore, they face bone density and muscle loss if they don't keep their fitness levels in check during missions.

To enable them to use gym equipment in zero-g, they wear harnesses and bungee straps. Cristoforetti says training and nutrition is very important to her while working in such tough conditions.
