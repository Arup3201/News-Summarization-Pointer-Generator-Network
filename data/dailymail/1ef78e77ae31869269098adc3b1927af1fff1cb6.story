Four people were forced to climb to safety after their narrowboat ended up jammed in a canal lock and the water emptied away.

The canal boat they were travelling in was left hanging precariously in mid-air in a canal lock in Saddleworth, Greater Manchester.

Those on board managed to escape to safety by walking to the back of the boat and climbing out onto the towpath, and although left shocked, none were injured. 

Escape: A man is pictured walking along the side of the narrowboat which became lodged as water emptied

Stuck: Boat became lodged as water was emptied away at canal lock in Saddleworth, Greater Manchester 

Jump: A man in a hi-vis vest climbs down onto the roof of the narrowboat which is tilted at a precarious angle

The boat was left hanging at a 45 degree angle and was flooded at the front as it was submerged underwater on Sunday.  

It is thought the back of the boat became lodged on stonework as the water was being emptied at the Lime Kiln Lock on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal.  

A witness said this was the second incident in the last few weeks.

Help: Those on board walked to the back of the boat and climbed out onto the towpath to safety

The witness - who did not wish to be named - said: 'The people had got off the boat and were at the canalside.

'Amazingly they were on the boat as it happened, they all had to go to the back of the vessel and get off at the end of the lock.

'It could have been far worse because the boat was at a 45 degree angle. People were gathered round because they had never seen a boat like that before.

'They were going down-hill so when they've gone into the lock at water level but as the water left the lock to take the boat down they were still stuck on the stonework.

'It left them high and dry so to speak.'
