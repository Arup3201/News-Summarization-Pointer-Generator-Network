Brutal: Diana Lee's burnt body was discovered on Thursday. A post-mortem has revealed she was battered to death

A wealthy business-woman’s beaten and charred body was found at the country home where she ran an upmarket cattery.

The body of Diana Lee, 54, was found in a burnt-out garage at her £500,000 gated property in the heart of the Cheshire countryside.

A post-mortem examination revealed she had suffered horrendous head injuries in a violent attack and had not died as a result of the blaze.

It is thought that Mrs Lee had been involved in a legal dispute involving the cattery in the run-up to her death. The alarm was raised last Thursday morning by a postman who noticed the garage at the isolated property in the affluent village of Cranage had been badly damaged.

He called the fire brigade who carried out a search and discovered the body inside.

Detectives investigating Miss Lee’s murder later found her silver Vauxhall Corsa, which had been burnt out, in the village of Mobberley, ten miles away from her home.

Police received reports that a man was seen getting on a bicycle near the car and pedalling away from the scene.

Miss Lee’s former partner, Neville Barrett, 48, was arrested and has since been released on bail pending further investigations.

Last night residents of Cranage said they were ‘shocked and appalled’ by the death of their polite and well-liked neighbour. One villager said: ‘This is  totally appalling. It is the talk of the village. Everyone is just stunned by the news that a friend, neighbour and true gentlewoman could be so brutally killed.’

Another said: ‘This has all come as a complete shock to everybody  and is very upsetting.

‘She was quite sweet although we hardly ever saw her.

‘This is a really affluent area with lots of wealthy people so it is quite unsettling.’

Difficult: Forensic teams remove items from Mrs Lee's property. Cheshire Police said officers were hunting a mystery cyclist seen riding away from the spot where the Corsa was found abandoned

A neighbour said: ‘She was a very quiet lady but she was very nice.

‘She looked after the cats like they were her own.

‘It is quite a large property so they had plenty of room for them. It is all very strange to us here.’

Mrs Lee and Mr Barrett opened the 
Parklands Cattery two years ago after buying the substantial property in
2008. Cats staying there were accommodated in the lap of luxury, with  
furnished living areas with televisions and stereos, heated playrooms 
and outdoor exercise runs.

Its website boasted that the cattery 
was set in the ‘luxurious surroundings of the Cheshire countryside’, 
offering ‘the ultimate in comfort, fun and hygiene for your cat’.

Moving: Flowers left in tribute to Mrs Lee. Detectives want to trace any members of the public who saw a man cycling from Smith Lane, where the car was abandoned, towards Pepper Street in Mobberley between 10 and 11am on Thursday

The couple, who had been together for several years, later split up and Mr Barrett moved out of the house.

None of the 12 cats at the premises 
were injured in the blaze and all have since been transferred to another
cattery. Last night detectives appealed for information about the 
cyclist seen riding away from the abandoned car.

They are also keen to trace members of the public who might have seen the man cycle off.

Detective Inspector Steve Beddows of 
Cheshire Police said: ‘We are particularly keen to  speak to anyone who 
saw any activity in the vicinity of the home address of Mrs Lee on the 
morning of Thursday, August 9, before the arrival of the emergency 
services at 11am.

‘We also appeal to anyone who may have
seen a man acting suspiciously near to a silver Corsa in Mobberley, 
which was later identified as belonging to the victim and had been taken
from her house.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
