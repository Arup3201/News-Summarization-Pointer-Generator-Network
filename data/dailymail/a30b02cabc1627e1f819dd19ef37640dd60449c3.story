QPR manager Harry Redknapp bears no grudge against Adel Taarabt following their public spat this week and insists he merely wants the Morocco playmaker to return to shape and form.

Redknapp and Taarabt had a public argument after the Rangers boss accused the midfielder, who spent last season on loan at Fulham and AC Milan, of being overweight.

'I don't hold grudges,' Redknapp said.

Taarabt spoke to the Daily Mail to hit back at his manager's claims, and prove that he is not overweight

'He got pushed into writing a load of stuff that wasn't true. I don't think he's been fined and I wouldn't want to fine him.

'I've always been a manager where people go, 'You do love a problem player'. Yes, I have.

'The big difference is the ones I've had before keep producing on the pitch.

'Unfortunately at the moment Adel needs to produce. He's got great talent.

'He could be an incredible, incredible footballer for this football club.'

Redknapp lost patience with Taarabt after last Sunday's last-gasp loss to Liverpool, which kept Rangers bottom of the Barclays Premier League ahead of Monday's clash with Aston Villa at Loftus Road.

The QPR boss added: "It was something that happened before the game and during the week. Maybe I just got the needle. When I get the hump I do tend to say what I feel.

"He has tested me. He's tested everybody. (But) I'm the one that's stuck with him.

"I'm bang on his side. No-one could be more on his side than what I've been. When you're on someone's side so much and you get let down, at some stage you tend to crack over it.

"Like with your kid misbehaving, you say 'don't do that', 'don't do that'. In the end you get the hump with them enough and you send them to bed, or whatever. That's how I felt last Sunday."

Redknapp, who recalled how he rescued Taarabt from Tottenham's reserves when he was Spurs boss, was hurt by comments made by the midfielder.

Taarabt suggested Redknapp was rarely present on the training ground, something the QPR manager insisted was false.

"None of them were true," Redknapp added.

"I'm out on that training ground every single day. When people say I'm not out there all morning, that is a blatant lie.

"I think it might've been someone else trying to be mischievous and telling him what to say.

"Whatever. It's done and dusted. I just want to be positive now.

"I've had ups and downs with him before, but I've had more ups than downs with him.

"I've brought coaches in here that think I'm off my head for keep sticking with him and trying to get him onside. They'd have bombed him out ages ago, but I haven't.

"I said to (first-team coach) Glenn Hoddle when he came in 'have a look at his ability'. And Glenn went (puffs out cheeks) 'corr, he can play'.

"About three days later, Glenn's going to me 'why doesn't he train?' And that's the problem.

"The only person that can help Adel is himself. I want him to do that. I still believe in him.

"I love watching him do things on the football pitch. I love it when he does something special.

"I just want him to come and train hard and get back in the team. We need him."

Taarabt is not in contention for Monday's match.

"He's been ill all week," Redknapp added.

"He's not been well this week, he's had a sore throat, so he's not been available to train. He's going to train this morning (Saturday)."

Rob Green is available following illness which kept him out of the Liverpool match and could displace Alex McCarthy in goal.

Defender Nedum Onuoha (hamstring) and midfielder Sandro (groin) are doubts.

Midfielders Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch (both hamstring) remain out alongside long-term absentee Alejandro Faurlin (knee).
