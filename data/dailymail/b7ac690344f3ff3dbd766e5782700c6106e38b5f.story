It is rare for Jeremy Peace, the West Bromwich Albion chairman, to attend the club’s training ground. But when there is serious business to sort, he appears.

Business such as finding a fourth permanent head coach in little more than a year. As stand-ins Rob Kelly and Keith Downing put the players through their paces on Tuesday, Peace’s personalised number plate was visible in the car park.

He started the day in negotiations with two possible replacements for Alan Irvine, sacked late on Monday night and placed on gardening leave, just as Steve Clarke was 12 months ago.

Tony Pulis and Tim Sherwood were the only two candidates spoken to — and on Tuesday night Pulis was on the brink of accepting the job. The plan is for him to be appointed in time for the FA Cup third-round tie against Gateshead on Saturday.

Hurdles appear to have been overcome, too. Former Crystal Palace manager Pulis has always made it plain that he would want full control over transfers and the imminent appointment perhaps illustrates that Peace is ready to give a little in his demands.

For the past eight years Peace’s preferred, trusted hierarchy sees a head coach taking care of training, with player recruitment left to a technical director — Terry Burton in this situation.

Having taken over at Albion in 2002, Peace grew concerned about English football’s traditional managerial model. He did not like the fact a manager would identify talent and insist on certain individuals.

Nor did he think it was healthy to have a manager bringing an array of staff into a club and then leading a mass exodus when a parting of the ways arrived.

Peace embarked on a tour of Europe, eager to see how the likes of Porto, Udinese, Rennes and Bologna operated.

‘The sporting director role was evident in all of the clubs,’ said Peace in a rare interview with Sportsmail last year. They were all looking at England saying, “We cannot understand what’s going on when we deal with England. The clubs there pay top price, they don’t really check what they are buying”.’

Peace reached a watershed with Bryan Robson in charge — unsatisfied with his player recommendations — and decided to implement the continental structure he employs to this day. Burton’s appointment in the summer looked to have strengthened Peace’s resolve over the arrangement.

The former Wimbledon manager, who arrived from heading Arsenal’s development teams, works alongside sporting director Richard Garlick.

Essentially, Burton seeks out the talent — with the aid of West Brom’s scouting network — and Garlick gets deals over the line, concentrating on finances.

The role had been a single one occupied by Dan Ashworth before he left for the FA in September 2012.

In this structure, Irvine was solely responsible for training the players and picking the team. Pulis, however, will want to enter The Hawthorns as the principal man and instructed his advisers to make that point to Pearce. 

He walked away from Crystal Palace on the eve of the season because he was frustrated that transfer targets he identified had not materialised.

Informed observers expressed shock at any softening of Peace’s methods. But maybe, driven to keep West Brom among the riches of the Premier League, he has opened up to compromise.

The 58-year-old’s worst nightmare would be relegation to the Sky Bet Championship. He has built the club into a sustainable business by running such a tight ship that gym equipment is rented rather than bought because fashions can change.

West Brom turned a £6million profit in the latest financial accounts.

Even with players having to take a 50 per cent cut in wages in the event of relegation, Peace would find such a prospect unpalatable. Sherwood, the former Tottenham manager, was an option, and he was approached about taking over when Pepe Mel.

On that occasion the wages Sherwood wanted for his right-hand man proved the stumbling block to his appointment.

Pulis has won that battle, too. The 56-year-old will be joined by long-serving assistant David Kemp, who is based in Florida.

Irvine was a popular figure and his training methods were liked. But, as one well-placed source put it, ‘he was just a head coach’.

There is an inevitable problem that players, perhaps subconsciously, will not treat the coach charged with inspiring results the same as they would a manager.

Despite all his battles won with previous incumbents, it is something Peace appears to be willing to shift on to land Pulis.
