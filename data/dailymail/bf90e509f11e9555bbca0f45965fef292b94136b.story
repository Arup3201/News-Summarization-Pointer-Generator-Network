Manchester City target Fernando is so desperate to join the club he has cut short his holiday in Brazil.

The Porto midfielder flew back from South America to Portugal and is poised to travel to England to complete a £14.5million move to the Barclays Premier League champions.

‘Fernando is in Porto waiting for the club to tell him the transfer documents are completed and he can travel immediately,’ said his agent Antonio Araujo.

Transfer: City hope to conclude a £17.5m deal for the Brazilian defensive midfielder

City finally look set to get their man after failing with a bid to sign the Brazilian in the January transfer window.

Manuel Pellegrini has been interested in the 26-year-old for some time and sees him as the ideal player to assist Yaya Toure and Fernandinho in central midfield next season, as City try to challenge on four fronts.

City’s plans for next season’s Champions League campaign have received a huge boost after it was confirmed the club will only need to name five rather than eight home-grown players in their reduced 21-man squad.

Pressure from the players’ union FIFPro has forced UEFA to agree to water down its sanctions imposed against City and Paris St Germain for breaching financial fair play rules.

Despite Fernando’s imminent move Javi Garcia looks set to stay at the club, with Pellegrini valuing the Spaniard’s versatility.
