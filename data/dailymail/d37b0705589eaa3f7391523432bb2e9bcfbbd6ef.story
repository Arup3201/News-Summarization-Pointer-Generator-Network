With their loud shouts of ‘Oh no it isn’t!’, pantomimes have always had a proud tradition of audience participation.

But one amateur production suffered more than its fair share of boos and hisses – when a rival group turned up to heckle the performance.

Their jeers were so distracting it caused cast members to stumble over their lines and terrified a number of children on stage, leading organisers to brand it ‘sabotage’.

Members of the Chard Amateur Theatre Society (pictured during the dress rehearsal for their performance of Aladdin) were said to have stumbled over their lines and been 'left terrified' by the jeers from their rivals

Chard Amateur Theatre Society (CATS) had performed a successful run of Aladdin and was looking forward to a triumphant last night.

But members claimed their final performance was ruined when several people of the rival Tatworth Amateur Pantomime Society (TAPS) turned up at the show in Guildhall in Chard, Somerset.

Organisers last night said the unwelcome guests were once part of CATS but left because they did not get the parts they wanted.

One anonymous audience member said the evening was ‘ruined’ by the uninvited interruption, adding: ‘Now, there is crowd participation, which every pantomime should strive to encourage, but this was clearly interference and sabotage.

‘A number of the CATS cast were singled out for special treatment and the hecklers became louder and louder until these cast members became visibly nervous and began to make mistakes. 

'At this point the feeling of victory from the hecklers was palpable as they jeered and laughed out loud, and a number of children in the cast left the stage terrified after performing.’ 

CATS leader Lorraine Marshall said there would be no tit-for-tat retaliation. She said: ‘Every panto wants booing and hissing and that sort of stuff but this was over the top.

Cast members from Tatworth Amateur Pantomime Society (pictured) admitted heckling the performance at the Guildhall in Chard, Somerset, but said it was 'just a little bit of banter' and said the group 'took offence'

‘A few of them used to be part of our cast and didn’t get the parts they wanted, and they have got quite nasty about it. It’s very disappointing.

‘I felt very sorry for the cast and members of the audience because people have said to me that it ruined their night.’ 

TAPS insisted it was just ‘a bit of banter’. 

Secretary Sheila Harding added: ‘It wasn’t anything different to what others might do at a performance where people know one another. 

‘Some of our members gave a little bit of banter and they took offence. 

'We go to many local pantos, not just Chard, and it is all just part and parcel of it. It’s part of the banter between groups.

‘Maybe we might have been a fraction too loud but we are expecting them to retaliate at our performance.’
