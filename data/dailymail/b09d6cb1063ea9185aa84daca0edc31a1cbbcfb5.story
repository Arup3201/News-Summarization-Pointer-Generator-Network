The elderly alpha male of the only brown bear colony in the Pyrenees is facing castration after officials discover he has been breeding with his own offspring for the past two decades.

Pyros the bear's 'sexual domination' of the colony of 30-odd bears living near Val d'Aran, Spain, has seen him end up the father, grandfather and great-grandfather to every cub born in the colony for the past 20 years.

Spanish officials are now facing the difficult decision of either castrating or capturing 26-year-old Pyros in order to stop the dangerous level of inbreeding which is risking the species' survival in the European mountain range.

The bear’s sexual dominance came to light after Spanish officials discovered that Pyros was both father and grandfather to a recent cub.

At 26, Pyros’ ‘vigour’ should have slowed down in his late teens, however, Pyros remains as active as ever, resulting in dangerous levels of inbreeding in the colony.

The colony of 30-odd bears include four other males, but only one is not an offspring of Pyros’ and none of them have fathered any cubs, officials found.

As a result, Spanish officials say they have to choose between castrating Pyros and segregating him from the group in order to secure the species’ survival in the Pyrenees.

‘If he keeps up this sexual vigour and dominant attitude for a few more years, the other males in the mountains have no chance of mating with any of the females,’ Val d’Aran environmental councillor José Enrique Arró, told La Vanguardia, according to The Guardian.

If Pyros is not castrated he would have to be moved, however, due to his old age, sedating and moving him to a new area – wild or in captivity – could cause fatal stress and other risks to his health.

A representative from the Catalan regional government told the paper that even if Pyros is sterilised and left with the colony, his dominant sexual behaviour could continue, making it difficult for the other males to mate with the females of the group.

Mr Arró said he hopes that the introduction of a new bear to the colony could help, but it is also possible that Pyros’ family jewels can be saved if his biological clock finally begins to tick and he starts to act his age.

Local authorities have long fought to save the brown bear population of the Pyrenees by transferring brown bears over from Slovenia.

The last indigenous female brown bear in the mountain range, which forms the natural border between France and Spain, was shot by a hunter in 2004.
