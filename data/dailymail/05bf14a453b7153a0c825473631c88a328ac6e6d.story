A thief converted his van into a makeshift fuel tanker that he used to raid petrol forecourts.

Ryan Lewis, 28, converted his Ford Transit by installing a huge tanker capable of holding 4,550 litres of fuel.

The transportable tank allowed Lewis to steal huge amounts of petrol, totalling £6,500, in front of unsuspecting staff at service stations before driving off.

Jailed: Ryan Lewis, 28, was sentenced to eight months in prison at Bradford Crown Court after fitting a 4,550-litre container (right) in his Ford Transit van and using it to steal fuel from service stations

Officers spotted Lewis, from Bradford, on CCTV 
filling up two vehicles with £130 of fuel at a time without paying as he 
travelled between petrol stations across West Yorkshire.

When he was arrested, detectives 
discovered he had fitted large containers capable of carrying about 
1,000 gallons in fuel into a Ford Transit van and a Ford Focus.

Police
released photographs of the converted white van and warned fuel thieves
they will be locked up after Lewis was jailed for eight months.

He was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court after pleading guilty to two counts of theft.

His
swindling was discovered the end of a six-month investigation by 
officers from Airedale and North Bradford specifically dealing with fuel
theft under Operation Kerryhil.

PC Dennis McCoy, of Airedale and North
Bradford CID, said: 'He would travel from one petrol station to 
another, filling up the vehicles with £130, the most that can be taken 
from a fuel pump at a time.

'Making off from petrol stations without payment for fuel is a serious offence and this sentence sends out a message that if you steal fuel we will catch you and you will very likely go to jail.'

Detective Sergeant John Wolstencroft, who leads the team, said detectives had worked closely with a number of petrol stations and garages across the area during the investigation.
