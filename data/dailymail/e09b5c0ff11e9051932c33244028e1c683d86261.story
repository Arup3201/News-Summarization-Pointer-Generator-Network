Real Madrid superstars arrived in Morocco on Sunday evening to begin their participation in the World Club Cup.

The Champions League winners touched down in Rabat, although Tuesday's semi-final against Mexican side Cruz Azul has been moved to Marakkech after heavy rain left the pitch at the Prince Moulay Abdellah stadium in a 'farcical' condition.

Leading Los Blancos' assault on the tournament will be Cristiano Ronaldo who was named BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year at a gala event in London on Sunday - becoming only the second footballer, after his Brazilian namesake Ronaldo (2002), to pick up the award.

Former Tottenham winger Gareth Bale presented Ronaldo with the award via satellite link-up and the Welshman also spoke of his own incredible year at the Bernabeu, which saw him score in the finals of both the Copa del Rey and Champions League.

Asked, which victory gave him most pleasure, Bale said: 'The special thing is the Champions League. Every footballer wants to win the biggest competition in the world so to win and score is a dream come true.

Bale responded to host Gary Lineker's teasing about whether he had mastered the Spanish language yet by saying: 'It's a bit difficult with the language but I'm learning slowly.'

Carlo Ancelotti's side travel to Morocco on the best-ever winning streak in the club's history after notching a 20th consecutive victory in the 4-1 defeat of Almeria and will be hoping to lift the World Club Cup for the first time.

Their opening opponents Cruz Azul battled past Asian champions Western Sydney Wanderers, winning 3-1 in extra-time on a waterlogged pitch in Saturday's quarter-final.

'The whole 120 minutes was disgusting,' Wanderers goalkeeper Ante Covic said in a TV interview.

'It was absolutely farcical what happened out there and it's unacceptable to me,' added. 

In the other semi-final, Copa Libertadores champions San Lorenzo - incidentally the team supported by Pope Francis - take on Auckland City FC for a place in Saturday's fiinal.
