Athletics, a sport tainted by regular drugs scandals, has nevertheless received the huge £200million-plus backing of Japanese marketing giants Dentsu for the next 15 years.

Dentsu will announce that they are renewing their agency partnership with the IAAF — track and field’s ruling body — until 2029.

Backing: Lord Coe is favourite to succeed IAAF president Lamine Diack

IAAF sources say the massive marketing and rights deal for a sport that has had more than its fair share of negative publicity will guarantee them a minimum £11m a year — with extra on a profit share — until 2019 and then £14m a year as a minimum for the next decade. The agreement will ensure IAAF president Lamine Diack leaves the organisation in a healthy financial state when he steps down next year.

The favourite to succeed Diack is Lord Coe, who has enjoyed a good relationship with Dentsu since they became the IAAF’s marketing partners. The Japanese agency would not have committed to such a long contract if they did not fully expect Coe to take the helm.

Coe, who is sure to have a strong anti-drugs agenda when he launches his IAAF election manifesto to the 212 voting associations, is likely to compete against Ukraine’s pole vault great Sergey Bubka for the IAAF presidency.

But the troubles in Ukraine and Bubka’s support for the overthrown pro-Russian government, plus his rash challenge for the IOC presidency last year, has put Coe in pole position for the role he covets most.

The football conference season starting this week might not quicken the pulse but that will not bother James Worrall, founder of the Leaders in Football brand of which he has sold a 50 per cent share to American City Business Journals for a reported £2.5m. Former FA employee Worrall had previously sold and then bought back Leaders on bargain terms from Russian ownership.

New face: Notts County's Jim Rodwell (left) made his FA international committee debut in Switzerland

Jim Rodwell, a journeyman lower league defender, was a long way from the England set-up as a player. But Rodwell, now Notts County chief executive and a Football League board member, made his FA international committee debut in Switzerland as part of the England party. He is one of the rare blazers who played football at a professional level.

The FA received presentations at their last board meeting on how TV rights partners BBC and BT intend to heavily promote the FA Cup when coverage starts with the first round on November 8. 

But, embarrassingly for the FA, there is still no sign of a new sponsor following Budweiser not renewing their contract. 

The FA, chasing a £9m-a-year partner, revamped their commercial department by bringing in Manchester United-honed expertise. 

So far this has not worked, although the FA are confident of signing a sponsor by the first round — if not, definitely by the flagship third round.

Carry on ranting, Roy

England manager Roy Hodgson’s ‘absolute f****** b*******’ briefing with the Press would not have happened if UEFA had their way. 

Tough talking: England boss Roy Hodgson let rip during press conference

The FA have been asked by European football’s governing body to hold all-in media conferences with TV, radio and newspapers so rights holders do not miss the best story line that invariably comes from Press rather than TV questioning. 

But the FA, to their credit, intend to carry on with separate conferences, even if it involves Hodgson letting off steam.

The story from the new Bobby Moore biography that England’s World Cup winning hero had been turned down for membership by Chigwell Golf Club sparked clubhouse comment that the problem was more to do with Moore’s entourage of drinking pals than the fabled footballer himself. It is also alleged Chigwell’s clubhouse was set on fire shortly after Moore was snubbed.

Turkish Airlines, who made a memorable commercial deal with sports stars Lionel Messi and Kobe Bryant, are understood to be top of the list to replace Samsung, whose contract as Chelsea shirt sponsors expires at the end of the season. Samsung have backed Chelsea since 2005 when former chief executive Peter Kenyon said the club was going to ‘paint the world blue’.
