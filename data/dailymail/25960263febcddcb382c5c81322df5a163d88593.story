A Goldman Sachs managing director has died following an apparent kiteboarding accident, police said.

The body of 39-year-old Nicholas Valtz was found floating off Lazy Point in Napeague Harbor, Long Island, on Sunday.

The amateur kiteboarder was still attached to his kite, while his gear was scattered in a grassy area of the harbor.

The East Hampton Star reported the Brooklyn resident went kiteboarding early in the morning.

When he failed to return by 2pm, relatives he was staying with at a Bridgehampton home called police.

'We’re
 deeply saddened by this tragedy and our thoughts are with Nick’s 
family,' Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally told Bloomberg. 

Police are still investigating the death and an autopsy will be undertaken.

The banker graduated from Harvard, as did his wife

Valtz joined the firm in 2000 and was 
promoted to managing director in 2010.

The cross-asset sales executive helped manage orders for trading clients and pitch them products from different types of securities, according to Bloomberg.

Mr Valtz graduated from Harvard in 1996 and fenced for three years as an undergraduate.

His wife Sashi Valtz, also 
works at Goldman Sachs, also went to Harvard and has over 15 years of banking experience.

The couple live in a 3,000-foot condo in the DUMBO section of Brooklyn with their two toddlers, a boy and girl.

Mr Valtz is bald in several photos online as he has previously shaved his head to raise money for cancer.

Kiteboarding or kitesurfing is a popular water sport combining windsurfing and paragliding which propels riders across the water up to 40 miles an hour.
