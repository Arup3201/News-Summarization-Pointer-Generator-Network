Facing jail: Ursula Rose, pictured today, was found guilty of fraud and theft totaling more than £20,000 today

A primary school teaching assistant who pretended she had terminal brain cancer to trick colleagues into handing her £20,000 for 'life saving treatment' faces jail.

Former colleagues cheered from the public gallery after Ursula Rose was found guilty of theft and fraud at Croydon Crown Court today.

The 42-year-old said she had 'tumours in her head', which were in fact headaches caused by stress.

Nevertheless she still claimed she needed to finance private Harley Street treatment for the illness, and her friends spiralled into debt after taking out loans and withdrawing money from their childrens' accounts to help.

Mother-of-four Rose, who worked at Saint Thomas Becket school in South Norwood, denied she invented the illness - instead claiming her victims volunteered to help her with money problems.

But a jury of six men and six women found Rose guilty of four counts of fraud, by falsely representing that she had a life-threatening illness, on various dates between September 30 2008 and July 31 2009.

Rose stared straight ahead as the jury gave her verdict, but former friends and colleagues stood up and shouted with joy as the verdict was returned.

Prosecutor Claire Robinson previously told Croydon Crown Court Rose had 
repeatedly made false representations to friends and work colleagues 
that she was suffering from cancer, and that she had tumours in her head.

She said: 'She did this to get their sympathy, to get loans of money from them. This was dishonest and calculated to make people feel sorry for her.

'Over a number of years she repeatedly told friends and colleagues that she was severely ill with cancer and she was doing it in order to gain money from people.'

Fellow teaching assistant Gillian Trype gave the defendant £3,000 after Rose convinced her she feared dying on the operating theatre table during a £37,000 private operation and felt her husband would not cope financially.

'She told her and others that the brain tumours were growing aggressively and she was going for daily chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment' Miss Robinson said.

'She was told by Ursula Rose that one of the tumours was wrapped around a main artery near her temple and it could kill her at any moment.

'She said it was terminal and at level four and she needed an operation that was too dangerous for the NHS so was paying £37,000 to go private.

'Mrs Trype's two daughters had money in their savings and she borrowed that, intending to repay it with a lump sum from her pension,'  explained Miss Robinson.

She said Rose took time off work for the non-existent 'operation' and when she returned told colleagues it had been partially successful, but a £7,000 American wonder drug could combat the remaining life-threatening tumour.

In June, 2009 staff attended a fundraiser at Croydon's Bar Txt, contributing to a collection aimed at raising money for the new drug.

Another member of staff, Allison Patmore, gave Rose £6,500 as a deposit on a £40,000 private Harley Street operation - again claiming it was too dangerous for the NHS -  the court was told.

Mrs Patmore took out a £6,200 loan, plus £300 cash from her bank account, accepting Rose's claim she would be repaid when her home was remortgaged.

Rose told long-time friend Michelle Willis she had only six months to live and needed a strong dose of radiotherapy - knowing her pal had money remaining from a recent house sale.

Mrs Willis gave her £5,000 and a few weeks later Rose asked for another £5,500 to avoid her home being repossessed. The friend convinced her own daughter, Sarah, to give Rose the money.

Eventually the school's headmaster, Noel Campbell, received confirmation from Rose's doctor at Mayday University hospital that she never had cancer.

'He said she did not, and never had, brain tumours, but suffered from tension-like headaches.'

Rose then resigned in February, 2010, telling the headmaster she had been given the cancer all-clear and was cured.
