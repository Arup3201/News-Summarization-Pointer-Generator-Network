Supermarket giant Morrisons is sparking a major fuel war by slashing a record 15p off a litre of petrol for anyone spending £60 in store. 

The petrol discount is the biggest ever offered in the UK, and comes a month after rival Tesco gave customers 10p off petrol when they spent £60.

As the cost of oil soars, thousands of campaigners are preparing for a landmark day of action to demand lower fuel tax ahead of next month's budget.

Slashing prices: The discount offered by the supermarket giant is the biggest ever in the UK and will be welcome news for drivers

Fairfuel UK is organising a mass lobby of Parliament to combat what it calls an 'absolute crisis', with Chancellor George Osborne planning a 3p-a-litre increase in fuel duty in August.

Richard Lancaster, Morrisons marketing director, said: 'We know how tough it is for our customers. This deal will help them in these tough economic times.

'Nobody has ever knocked this much off a litre of fuel before. This will make a real difference for our customers.'

The announcement from Morrisons will be welcome news for families returning to the school run this week after the half-term holiday.

It is likely to trigger a rush by other supermarkets to offer fuel deals in an effort to compete.

Asda slashed pump prices by 2p a litre in November, and it proved to be one of the few supermarkets that defied typically poor sales for retailers over the festive period.

Road rage: Soaring oil prices and a planned rise in fuel duty could lead to protests like the 'Go Slow' demonstration of last May

But a spokeswoman for the supermarket said today: 'Discounted petrol that’s dependent on buying overpriced groceries, is a fuel’s paradise.'

Diesel prices reached a record high last week and crude oil hit its highest sterling price of £77.20 yesterday.

The average forecourt price is now 
143.05p a litre – meaning it costs more than £100 to fill up the 
70-litre tank in a typical family car.

The rising cost of crude oil is the key factor behind the soaring price of petrol.

The biggest influence on prices at present are:

The price of diesel in the UK rose to an all-time high this month as speculators drove up crude oil prices and refineries failed to keep up with British demand.

Petrol prices are also on the rise, hitting 135.39p a litre last week, just shy of the 137.43p record reached in May last year.

Motorists are paying £20.50 more than just two years ago to fill their cars with petrol – a punishing 26 per cent rise.

Morrisons said that customers who take part in their 'Fuel Britannia' deal and spend £50 on fuel should receive savings of well over £5.

The vouchers will be issued from February 23 to March 4 and drivers will be able to claim the discount at Morrisons petrol stations until March 11.

Paul Watters, head of public affairs at the AA, welcomed the news about the Morrisons discount, saying: 'It always takes supermarkets to step into the fray and push prices down.

'Anything that keeps the other forecourts on their toes is a good thing.

'This is excellent news at a time when diesel prices have reached a record high and will bring some relief to motorists - but it may only be short term depending on which way oil prices go.'

Fuel duty: How the average tank of petrol and diesel breaks down

But Mr Watters warned that there is often a disparity between petrol prices in 'supermarket towns' and 'non-supermarket towns', such as Bedford and Luton or Margate and Canterbury, with costs varying by as much as 5p per litre.

Fairfuel UK will confront MPs on March 7 along with struggling motorists, taxi firms, catering companies and car companies including the RAC.

Peter Carroll from Fairfuel UK said: 'This is an absolute crisis in the history of the nation. Enough is enough. The current fuel prices are killing the economy and stunting growth.

'The Government has to cut fuel duty to create jobs and stimulate growth to start getting the deficit down.'

The RAC and Fairfuel UK will meet treasury minister Chloe Smith on Tuesday and are releasing a report on fuel duty on the same day in connection with the Centre for Economics and Business Research.

Mr Carroll said the report will call for a cut in fuel duty of at least 5p per litre. He said the group saw off rises of around 9p per litre last year.
