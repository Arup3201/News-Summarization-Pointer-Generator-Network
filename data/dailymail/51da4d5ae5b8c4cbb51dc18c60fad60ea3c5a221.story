A Florida woman has been charged after allegedly throwing her two-year-old child at police during an altercation after she crashed her car.

Police say that Tamika Williams, 28, crashed her SUV late Friday night, then tried to flee the scene.

When police arrived, she threw the child at an officer and repeatedly punched another officer in the head. She was eventually subdued with a taser.

Car crash: Tamika Williams crashed her car and then made things a lot worse by attacking police officers and throwing her child at them

Williams was driving at Signal Hill Road and Lantern Court in Orlando at about 11:55pm Friday when she lost control of her car and clipped a tree, causing the car to roll and knock down part of a fence.

A witness told the Orlando Sentinel that Williams got out of the car, then got back in and tried to drive away, but found the car was disabled.

Williams then removed her two-year-old daughter from the car and began to walk away from the scene.

Police arrived as Williams was a couple of blocks from the crash scene.

According to WESH, officers told Williams they were there to help her but she refused to stop walking.

The arrest report states that Williams threw her daughter at a male officer who ran in front of her to prevent her walking any further, 'forcing me to catch the baby.'

She then punched a female officer in the head and continued to hit the officer until the policeman subdued her with a taser.

A witness told WESH that Williams was bleeding from the head from injuries she sustained in the crash.

The arrest report states that Williams smelled of alcohol, although she was not charged with driving under the influence.

She was arrested on charges of child neglect, battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest with violence and leaving the scene of an accident.

WESH reports that Williams' daughter is now with her father.
