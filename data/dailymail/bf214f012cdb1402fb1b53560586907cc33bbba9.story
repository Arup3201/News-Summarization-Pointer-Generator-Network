Environment Agency staff were told to stay away from a flood-hit area because they were abused by members of the public when they tried to help, it has emerged.

Staff were abused in the Wraysbury area of Berkshire and were told to retreat by police. They have now been told to report any further abusive incidents to the agency.

An EA spokesman said: 'Some of our staff faced verbal abuse whilst working in Wraysbury on Monday. 'For a short while, we temporarily withdrew staff on the advice of the police.

'Our staff were back in Wraysbury yesterday and again today, working alongside members of the community and colleagues from other agencies as part of the continuing effort to deal with this exceptional period of weather and flooding.'

Justin Bowden, national officer of 'Briatin's General Union' the GMB said that widespread criticism of the EA by politicians, including Eric Pickles, had prompted the abuse.

He said: 'This report of hostility from the residents on the Thames is a direct result of the irresponsible attack by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and others on the EA.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, now put in charge of handling the flooding crisis by David Cameron, said Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith should make a public apology for its mistakes.

And asked whether Lord Smith, a former Cabinet Minister, should resign, Mr Pickles said bluntly: ‘He has to make his own decision.’

He accused Lord Smith of playing ‘divide and rule’ by ‘trying to set town against country’, letting the EA become ‘riddled with politically correct’ eco-fanatics opposed to dredging, presiding as the organisation ‘lost its way’ and spending 20 times more money on its bloated bureaucracy than on keeping rivers clear.

Mr Pickles’s comments at the weekend came 24 hours after Lord Smith visited the flood-hit Somerset Levels and refused to resign.

The Minister showed little sympathy over the mauling local residents gave Lord Smith, who lives in a £1 million London apartment with beloved Tibetan terrier Jinny.

‘It’s always good to get feedback from your customers,’ Mr Pickles observed drily. ‘At least he’ll never have to hire a focus group to know what people are thinking.’

Ignoring Labour claims that the Government is ‘scapegoating’ Lord Smith, Mr Pickles urged him to give in to demands to say sorry for the EA’s alleged failings.

‘It’s not a sign of weakness. A bit of reaching out and humanity and humility is good for everybody, whether a distinguished quangocrat or a member of the Cabinet.’

The GMB said David Cameron had repeatedly refused to say whether he would halt planned redundancies at the EA when he was asked by Labour leader Ed Miliband at Prime Minister's Questions.

Grants to the EA have been cut in real terms by more than a quarter over the past three years, said the GMB.

'The Government must immediately reverse the ludicrous cut of 1,700 EA jobs, followed by an independent inquiry into what are the realistic funding levels necessary to ensure the EA has both the capital budget to protect the country from flooding and drought and a big enough revenue budget to maintain, service and run these vital defences,' added Mr Bowden.
