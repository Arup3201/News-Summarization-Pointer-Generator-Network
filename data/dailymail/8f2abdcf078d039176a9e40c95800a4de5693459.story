A video showing Beyoncé Knowles' sister Solange attacking Jay Z took the internet by storm on Monday.

But the couple surprisingly were not keeping a low profile after news of the fight, which took place last week, broke.

Instead, the singer and rapper went to watch the Brooklyn Nets play Miami Heat at the Barclays Center in New York on Monday evening.

Laughing it off?: Beyonce and Jay Z attended the Brooklyn Nets vs. Miami Heat game in New York on Monday, hours after a video of Solange Knowles attacking her brother-in-law surfaced

And Beyoncé and Jay Z did their best to seem completely unfazed by the release of the dramatic footage, which was captured on surveillance camera in an elevator at The Standard hotel after the Met Gala, held at New York's Metropolitan Museum Of Art on May 5.

Instead, the pair were laughing and looking carefree as they sat courtside during the basketball game.

Beyoncé, 32, looked glamorous in a denim jumpsuit and black sandals with intricately designed gold heels.

Meanwhile
 Jay Z, real name Shawn Carter, was casually clad in a white T-shirt and
 trainers, along with black trousers and a gold chain around his neck.

Beyoncé was seen leaving the party with Solange after the fight, while Jay Z headed home alone in a separate car.

A
 few days later, the sisters apparently made a getaway to Costa Rica, 
where they apparently joined Kelly Rowland for her secret wedding.

On their feet: The excited pair jumped up to clap at one point, even though the Nets lost to the Heat

Cool customer: Much like during the elevator fight, Beyonce was calm and collected during the evening

Deep in thought: At one point the couple looked to be having a serious conversation, perhaps about the fight

Eyes on the prize: With even more attention on them than usual, Beyonce and Jay Z tried to focus on the game

According to Us Weekly, Kelly's wedding took place on Friday and was a 'quick, simple ceremony - only around 30 people.'

On
 Thursday, three days after the attack in an elevator at The Standard 
hotel in New York, Beyoncé and Solange arrived in Costa Rica onboard a 
private plane around 7:56pm, according to E!.

It
 comes after it was reported in local paper La Nación that their mother 
Tina Knowles, Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams and Kelly's 
fiance Tim Witherspoon were also in Costa Rica, suggesting it was for 
Kelly and Tim's nuptials, which has now been confirmed by UsWeekly.

Under control: Beyonce is said to have flown with Solange to Costa Rica for Kelly Rowland's wedding days after the attack

Damage control: Beyonce also left the Met Gala after party with Solange, who apparently had a row with Rachel Roy that same night

Nothing to see here: The power couple didn't seem to have a care in the world on the same day the video was released

Lean on me: Beyonce, who has two-year-old daughter Blue Ivy with Jay Z, looked like she was about to rest her head on his shoulder

Beyoncé did
 little to quash the rumours as she posted a picture on her Instagram, 
looking as though she was dressed in a bridesmaid outfit.

In
 the shocking video, Solange was lashing out wildly at her 
brother-in-law, 44, with both her arms and her legs, while her sister 
stood beside them looking curiously impassive.

The seemingly unprovoked attack plays out in footage obtained by TMZ.

Best seats in the house: Only the best will do for the basketball fans, who also attended a game on Saturday

All forgiven?: Jay Z was seen cuddling Solange's son at the basketball a few days following the incident

Shocking: The footage, caught on surveillance camera after the Met Gala on May 5, shows Solange lashing out wildly

Unprovoked?: It is not known what caused the fight. In the video, Jay Z did not retaliate while Beyonce stood there impassively

Solange can
 be clearly be seen kicking and swinging violently at Jay Z, the father 
of her two-year-old niece, Blue Ivy, after the trio step into the 
elevator.

The
 clip shows a man who appears to be a bodyguard holding her back, but 
the 27-year-old still manages to rain blows on Jay Z several times.

The bodyguard can also be seen pushing the emergency stop button in the elevator at the 12th floor, no doubt stop the fight spilling out in front of photographers. 

During the frenzied altercation, Jay Z grabs Solange's stiletto clad foot to block a kick but never attempts to retaliate.

While
 there still has been no word from either Beyonce or Jay Z's 
representatives, a spokesperson from The Standard Hotel in New York City
 has made a statement. Following calls regarding the leaked CCTV 
footage, reps for The Standard Hotel told MailOnline, they were 'shocked
 and disappointed' in what had been a 'clear breach of our security 
system'.

They said in a 
statement: 'We are investigating with the utmost urgency the 
circumstances surrounding the situation and, as is our customary 
practice, will discipline and prosecute the individuals involved to our 
fullest capacity.'

The aftermath: The trio are seen leaving the elevator immediately after the attack

Wedding belle: It is thought that Beyonce posted this photo from Costa Rica while sporting a bridesmaid outfit

It's
 not yet known what provoked the fight, however, the famous couple 
looked as happy as ever as they attended another Brooklyn Nets game on 
Saturday while Solange played a gig in New York.

Rather
 tellingly, Jay Z had his arms affectionately around Solange's son who 
is known as Juelz, now nine, as the family sat courtside.

Beyoncé and Jay Z have remained silent on Twitter following the incident, but Solange rather oddly tweeted on Sunday: 'This might have been top 10 days ever in life.'

It has also been claimed that Solange yelled at Rachel Roy earlier at the after party, held at the Standard's Boom Boom Room, with Us Weekly's source adding that Beyoncé 'got in the middle of it'.
