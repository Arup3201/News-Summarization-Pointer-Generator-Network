YouTube has helped police in Spain seize a fleet of super-powered speedboats used to smuggle drugs into the country from Morocco.

Police said they were tipped off to the gang's activities after a speed freak impressed by the high power machines uploaded on to the site pictures of the jet black high-powered speed boats in the area.

Senior detectives saw them, realised they were probably being used to run drugs, and after an undercover probe, impounded them.Â

The boats, 30 in all, were seized in the county of Campo de Gibraltar in the southern Spanish province of Cadiz.

They were berthed on a private jetty that was invisible from the road. As well as the boat seizures, police took into custody 19 men involved in the drug running operations from Morocco.

Local police spokesman Miles Alonzo Arana said: 'The boats were expensive, and the cars and houses the people using them had were also expensive. We just needed to match their official income with their wealth and we had them.

High speed: The video on YouTube showed the boats in use and police believe they were loaded with hashish that was being brought into Spain to be distributed across the country

Powerful: Each of the speedboats were about 15 feet long and equipped with a 250 horsepower engine, allowing them to travel at high speed

'The posting on YouTube of their illegal transport fleet gave us the break we needed.'

The video on YouTube showed the boats in use and police believe they were loaded with hashish that was being brought into Spain to be distributed across the country.

The boats were filled up with drugs from a mother ship operating just off the Moroccan coast. Each of the speedboats were about 15 feet long and equipped with a 250 horsepower engine, allowing them to travel at high speed.

Each boat is able to carry more than a ton of hashish. Police said that based on the number and capacity of the boats, as well as the drug smugglers' obvious luxury lifestyles, they were running a multi million pound operation.

During the police investigation, officers managed to seized more than three tons of cannabis at gang hideouts along the coast.
