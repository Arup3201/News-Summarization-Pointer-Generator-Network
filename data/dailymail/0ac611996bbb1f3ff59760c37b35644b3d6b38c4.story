An elderly World War II veteran and his wife were kicked out of their local McDonald's for exceeding the apparent 30-minute sitting limit.

Carl Becker, 87, and his wife Barbara Becker, 81, were asked to leave the fast-food restaurant by a manager on February 21 in Culpeper, Virginia.

The elderly couple, who have visited the chain for years, had apparently overstayed their welcome and were told to get out of the restaurant, which was half-empty in the mid-afternoon, so an employee could clean under their table.

A WWII veteran and his wife, both in their eighties, were asked to leave this McDonald's in Culpeper, Virginia after outstaying their welcome

The couple, who go to McDonald's 
because they are on a fixed income and Mr Becker enjoys the chicken 
sandwich, say it allows them to pass some enjoyable time talking 
together each day away from their home.

The Beckers, who have six children and 14 grandchildren, said they have never been kicked out of a place before. Mr Becker was so incensed by their treatment, he wrote a letter to his local newspaper the Star Exponent.

He
 wrote: 'I have had many experiences in my lifetime as a WWII veteran, a
 university teacher, a Professional Engineer, a retiree from the 
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization at the Pentagon, and the father 
of six children - three of whom are also senior citizens - but none as 
unusual as being asked to leave a restaurant so they could clean the 
floor under and around the table where I sat.'

The couple have gone back to McDonald's but not the one in Culpeper.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment today from the McDonald's' franchise owner Bob Drumheller.

A McDonald's branch in Flushing, Queens was at odds with group of elderly Koreans in January whom they said hog the tables for hours on end but buy very little

Earlier he issued a statement to WTOP: 'I
 care deeply about the comfort and satisfaction of my customers. My 
organization takes these matters seriously, and is investigating the 
customer's claims.

'I have also reached out to the customer to extend my 
apologies for this misunderstanding. Our focus will continue to be on 
serving our customers and providing them a welcoming experience.'

In January, a McDonald's restaurant in Queens, New York got into a dispute with a group of elderly Korean patrons who spent hours each day hogging tables while buying very little.
