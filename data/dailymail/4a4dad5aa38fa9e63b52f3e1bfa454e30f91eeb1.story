A banker who hated the kitchen cabinets fitted in his £12million apartment at Britain's most expensive address has received a £4milion payout from the wealthy developers.

Geoffrey Logue became embroiled in a bitter four-year legal battle with brothers Christian and Nicholas Candy which started over the quality of the finish at One Hyde Park.

The dispute, which descended into claim and counter-claim, ended with New York-based banker Mr Logue lodging a £28milion claim for damages in the High Court.

Mr Logue ultimately filed a case for breach of confidence, abuse of process and unlawful interference.

The final claim was made after he had a worldwide freezing order placed on his assets during the dispute.

Nicholas, who married Holly Valance in a fairytale wedding in Beverly Hills, and his brother eventually agreed to settle the case last year as the court hearing loomed.

They paid close to £4million plus Mr Logue's legal expenses which sources said are likely to run into hundreds of thousands of pounds.

The pair are Britain's best known luxury property developers and built the £1.15billion One Hyde Park in conjunction with Sheikh Hamad bin Jassam bin Jabr al-Thani.

The brothers purchased the site - a former 
1950s office block - for £150million in 2004 before spending a borrowed 
£1billion plus on the redevelopment.

Their dispute with Mr Logue over his £11.5million apartment bought off plan in 2007 is a rare bit of bad PR for the luxury development in Knightsbridge.

Properties in the building - which is just yards from Harrods - have changed hands for as much as £140million.

The problems started for Mr Logue, who owns property in New York, London and Italy, in 2008 when he realised the kitchen would be fitted with cream lacquer cabinets - while he wanted dark wood with bronze.

Later he was told that the washing machine and tumble dryer would have to go in the kitchen because a planned laundry room was instead going to house an air conditioning unit.

He told The Times: 'I didn’t want cream lacquer cabinets in my kitchen, no way, it looks like Ikea. I wanted a dark wood kitchen frame with bronze. That’s how this entire drama started.'

He added that the brothers later travelled to Milan to see him in an attempt to smooth relations over.

'Christian Candy came to Milan to meet me. He took out this floor plan and said, "I can’t give you back the laundry room but I can place the washing machine and tumble dryer so that if you are in the flat and the cleaner is doing the laundry, you won’t hear them".'

When the dispute broke out at the height of the financial crisis, many of the properties in the building remained unsold.

During the ensuing legal battle, Mr Logue had a worldwide freezing order placed on his assets whilst he was caught up in bankruptcy proceedings in US launched against his company.

Lawyers alleged that Mr Logue had attempted to evade service of legal papers in the US and claimed there was a serious risk he would try and dissipate his assets.

However, the freezing order was later lifted by Mr Justice Roth in the High Court after the lawyers who obtained the injunction in the first place accepted they had made a mistake.

CPC, Christian Candy's company, Project Grande, the company behind the One Hyde Park development and the brothers have all made clear they were not responsible for the argument their lawyers put before the court.

Andrew Shaw, a partner at Stewarts Law who were advising CPC, was later struck off after Mr Logue brought a private complaint before the Solicitor's Disciplinary Tribunal.

Mr Shaw has since had the ruling overturned by Mr Justice Jay in the High Court. His case will now be re-heard by the original tribunal.

Following the case, Mr Logue lodged his £28million High Court claim which was resolved last month with a £3,950,000 settlement in his favour.

The banker sold his flat at One Hyde Park for £16.8million in 2012, making a tidy profit on his original £11.5million investment.

In a statement released through his law firm, Mr Logue confirmed that he had received a payout.

'Shortly before Christmas, Christian Candy's CPC Group paid nearly £4,000,000 to settle the claim,' he said.

'In addition, it paid all the costs I incurred in the UK proceedings involving the Liquidating Trust.

'I am pleased with this result, although deeply disappointed at having been put to the trouble of this litigation. I do not intend to engage with the Candys any further.'

A spokesman for the Candy Brothers confirmed the case has been settled and added that they think it is 'out of date and a non story'.
