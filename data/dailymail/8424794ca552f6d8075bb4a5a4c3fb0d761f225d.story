Macabre: A fan tried to sell six pieces of burned bark taken from the site where Paul Walker was killed in a car crash on ebay for $100 each

But while thousands turned out for an 
emotional tribute to the actor, it emerged a twisted fan had tried to 
cash in on the tragedy by selling six pieces of charred bark from the 
crash site for $100 per item on ebay.

The macabre listing was soon taken down after the seller received a backlash of vitriolic messages from fans.

The
 memorial coincided with news that the Varsity Blues actor planned to 
give up his life as a Hollywood actor to spend more time with his 
15-year-old daughter, Meadow.

Meadow had recently moved from her home in Hawaii to live with Walker in Santa Barbara.

In an interview earlier this year, Walker described his daughter as 'the best partner I've ever had'.

'I've never had anything like this in my life,' he said.

'I've been so transient; I've been on my own since I was 16. There's a part of me who feels like I'm making up for lost time.'

According to two of Walker's closest friends, Ronn Shikari and Vince Krause, who both live in Hawaii, Walker believed he had accomplished all that he wanted from Hollywood and now believed he needed to devote himself to his daughter.

'He was a family man and I know it hurt him to be spending so much time away from Meadow on location; he loved being with his daughter, she was his world,' Ronn Shikari told The Mail Online.

'That’s why he wanted to retire from acting and talked to his family about it, as he’d achieved everything he wanted to achieve.

‘He earned millions from the last Fast and Furious.

'The big reason he wanted to quit acting was so that he could spend more time with Meadow. It’s a shame that it could never happen.’

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies planned to have a strong presence at the memorial today.

They encouraged attendees to obey all traffic laws, including not leaving memorial items in the roadway.

Many of the early arrivals parked in a nearby church lot, where they milled around and bundled up against chilly morning temperatures in the 40s.

Among those who turned out early was Edi Maya, a gardener who worked in Walker's neighborhood and said he chatted with the actor from time to time.

'I work next to his house every week, twice a week. Seeing those candles there, it's heartbreaking,' he told KABC-TV.

The event took place at Rodas' shop, and two stepped away for what was supposed to be a short drive in Rodas' car.

The limited-edition Porsche was previously owned by IndyCar driver Graham Rahal, who has said it could be difficult to drive.

Walker, the star of five of the six 'Fast & Furious' movies, was the face of the franchise.

He was making the seventh film in the series when he died.

Universal Pictures has shut down production while it contemplates how it might go forward without him.

An emotional Vin Diesel, Walker's long-time co-star and friend, posted another heartfelt message on his Facebook account on Friday, sharing his feelings about losing someone so close to him.

'When I heard, I immediately flew back to California, and went directly from the plane to his mother's house,' the 46-year-old star wrote.

'I thought they needed my strength, but realized when I got there and broke down before his family, that it was I who needed theirs.

'His mother hugged me and said I am so sorry ... I said sorry? You're the mother who lost a son?

'She said yes, but you lost your other half ...'
