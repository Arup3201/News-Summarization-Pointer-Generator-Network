Austrian police are searching for a wealthy British lawyer suspected of kidnapping his son from his former German partner.

Police believe the multi-millionaire may be trying to take his son to the Channel Island of Sark, where the father is the chairman of the Finance and Commerce Committee.

Stefan Gomoll's 4-year-old son, Caspar, has not been seen since he was snatched from a playground in Baden, Lower Austria yesterday.

The boy and his mother had been living on Sark, but they moved to Baden to be near her parents when she broke up from Mr Gomoll in April 2012.

The mother was granted sole custody and Mr Gomoll has been fighting a custody battle for his son since January this year.

In February 2013, however, the two had returned to Sark, but went back to Baden in August after Mr Gomoll threatened to put Caspar in boarding school.

A legal source close to the case said the mother - who has not been named - is currently being treated for shock and 'too distressed to speak.'

The mother's lawyer Britta Schönhart said: 'We hope that the child’s father will come to his senses and that the case will be brought to a positive conclusion.'

Austrian police said the father had turned up unexpectedly at the mother's address in Baden on Monday, and asked to see his son.

The mother agreed, saying he could take the boy to the park, but only on the condition the boy's grandfather accompany them.

Mr Gomoll and the boy vanished when the grandfather used the toilet.

The legal source said that police have applied for a Europe-wide arrest warrant.

The boy has joint German and British nationality.

Austrian
police confirmed the incident and said a search was ongoing for a child
but refused to give any further information about the case as the 
investigation is ongoing.
