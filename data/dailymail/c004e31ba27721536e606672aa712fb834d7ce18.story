Jordan Daniel Heslin had to ask staff to open the automatic door at Lloyds bank in Stanley, County Durham moments after trying to walk out with more than £2,000. He was jailed for two years at Teesside Crown Court

A bungling bank robber had to ask staff to open the door to let him out - and even apologised to the cashier before fleeing.

Jordan Daniel Heslin’s escape plan did not start well when the automatic door failed to open and he was forced to return to the counter to ask: 'Can one of you let us out?'

Durham Crown Court heard that the debt-ridden 22-year-old, who searched the internet at his local library for tips on how to rob banks, was seen pacing up and down the street outside the Lloyds bank on Front Street in Stanley, County Durham.

He then entered with his hood pulled up and a scarf partially covering his face before handing a note to a female cashier.

It read: 'I have a gun. Stay calm, I don’t want to hurt anyone. I need £6,000. Don’t put it in a bag. I’ll be out in a hurry. Sorry.'

Victoria Lamballe, prosecuting, said: 'Panicked and shaken, she didn’t know what to do next and shouted to a branch manager.

'She, in turn, looked at the note and glanced at the defendant who said: 'I’m sorry, I’m desperate.'

The manager took some £10 and £20 notes from a drawer and showed them to Heslin, who told her: 'That’ll do.'

When the door was opened, he left with £2,140 but the robbery was so low key other customers were unaware it had even taken place.

However, closed-circuit footage was circulated which led to Heslin being quickly identified. The court heard his own grandmother recognised him.

'He fully admitted the offence and told police that having spent the previous morning in a JobCentre, he felt all he needed to make something of his life was some money, which is when he decided to rob a bank.

'He researched it at the library and felt he needed £6,000 to pay off his debts, which would leave some money for his children and £1,000 to start his new life.

'He then said he summoned up the courage to enter and approached the cashier.'

He told police that he understood the fear he had caused the bank staff and felt sorry for them.

Police arrived at the scene quickly and although a man was arrested shortly afterwards, he was released after offering an alibi.

Heslin, of Edward Street, New Kyo, near Stanley, County Durham, was arrested at a friend’s flat in Gateshead early the next day, still with £1,703. He admitted a charge of robbery.

Peter Walsh, mitigating, told the court: 'It was clear he was almost apologising to the bank staff involved, telling them: “I’m sorry” and “I’m desperate”.

'Even the manager who was present said she felt: “What a stupid lad. What have you done?”

'Her colleague said she did not want to think badly of him because of the way he came in.

'This illustrated the unique nature of how these offences were committed.

'Given the camera images it was only a matter of time before he was traced.

'When police found him he assisted an officer in retrieving the money.'

Mr Walsh added that Heslin was ‘sick of being in debt’ and having previously worked full-time was only on a zero-hours contract at the time of the robbery.

Jailing him for two years, Judge Neil Clark said: 'You walked into that bank and committed what appears to have been a somewhat apologetic robbery.

'But, what you chose to do was completely wrong.

'You were naive in the way you carried it out, but you were acting irrationally.

'Those in the bank did not know if there was a gun present or not.

'Although terrified, it’s clear neither probably thought you had a gun, but they couldn’t take the risk.'
