Nearly half of middle-class parents are worried their children will be worse off than them, a study will say.

The report from the charity 4Children - which will be launched by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg on Wednesday - reveals that parents were more optimistic at the height of the recession.

More people believe family life is harder now than 20 years ago - and middle-class parents are more anxious about their children’s future than even those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.

A survey for the study found 42 per cent of people with average or above-average incomes were pessimistic about the chances of their children in life - and just 22 per cent were optimistic.

But 37 per cent of those on below-average incomes were pessimistic, and 25 per cent were hopeful.

It comes after the Government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn said living costs and an ‘exclusion’ from the property market will see many children endure lower living standards than their parents.

Along with his deputy, former education secretary Baroness Shephard, they believe the children of today could be the first for at least 100 years to be worse off than the generation before them.

The report by 4Children - established 31 years ago as The National Out of School Alliance - will claim that modern Britain has not kept up with changes in family life, reported The Daily Telegraph.

It will propose various ideas over issues such as the protection of parks, as well as suggesting support networks for grandparents who have a rising responsibility for childcare in the UK.

The Observer reported yesterday that the study will also say a quarter of parents think the biggest improvement to family life would come from more affordable, flexible or accessible childcare.

Just 30 per cent of parents believe current childcare provisions are family-friendly, with the main complaint that they are insufficiently flexible.
