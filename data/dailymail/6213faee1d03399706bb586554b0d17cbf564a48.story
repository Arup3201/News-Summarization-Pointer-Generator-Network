Ryder Cup veteran Phil Mickelson sat out a whole day's play for the first time in 10 appearances after USA captain Tom Watson chose to bench the five-time major winner.

The left-hander and Keegan Bradley won a point in Friday's fourballs after edging a narrow victory over a struggling Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy but were comfortably beaten in the foursomes by Graeme McDowell and Victor Dubuisson.

Mickelson's coach Butch Harmon expressed his surprise that Mickelson, at 44, had been asked to go out twice on the opening day but Watson chose not to use his most experienced player - making a record-breaking appearance for America - or Bradley on Saturday.

For the second successive Ryder Cup, the pair were rested for the middle afternoon as Davis Love opted to rest them despite winning three out of three at Medinah two years ago.

'Whatever it takes to win. I want our team to win, and whatever we have to do is all I care about,' said Mickelson, who refused to comment on who had made the decision not to play.

That seemed obvious after Watson spoke about his selections.

'They (Mickelson and Bradley) didn't perform all that well on Friday afternoon,' said the USA captain.

'They really wanted to go on Saturday (but) these are the best pairings for alternate shot.

'I'm riding the horses. Jimmy (Walker) and Rickie (Fowler) really played well.

'Three times they halved matches - that's better than not winning.'
