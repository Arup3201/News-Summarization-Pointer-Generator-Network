Tragic: Debbie Smith attends the inquest into the death of her fiance, soldier Matthew Cottrell, at Bournemouth Coroners Court today

A young soldier was mown down and killed by a coach after he was dropped off on a dark road because he didn't have enough money to pay his taxi fare, an inquest heard today.

Matthew Cottrell, 24, who was two weeks away from getting married, had been 
heading towards his army camp after a night out with colleagues but had 
to abandon the taxi ride as he was £30 short.

As he walked alone along a darkened A-road he was struck from behind by a 14-ton single decker coach travelling at nearly 50mph.

Mr Cottrell had become separated from
his three army friends on the night out and they came across the scene 
of the fatal crash as they travelled towards the barracks.

One
of them, Sapper Kristopher Knight, desperately tried to revive his 
comrade but he was pronounced dead at the scene on the A35 in Poole, 
Dorset.

Mr Cottrell had been just two weeks away from getting married to girlfriend Debbie Smith when the tragedy occurred.

After
an inquest into his death, Miss Smith confronted taxi driver Jovan 
Josic, asking him why he dropped her fiance off on an unsafe road and 
had to be pulled away by family members.

The
army camp had an unofficial policy of paying soldiers' taxi fares if 
they didn't have enough money, but local taxi companies were not aware 
of this.

The hearing in 
Bournemouth heard Mr Cottrell, a sapper in the Royal Engineers, and his 
three friends had caught a train to Poole for a night out in June last 
year.

He had nearly not joined pals on the 
booze-fuelled evening out, claiming he only had 16 pence to his name but
eventually agreed to go after friends loaned him some money.

During the evening the group, made up of Royal Engineers downed lager, Sambuca and cocktails.

In the early hours of June 23 Matthew
was described as 'heavily intoxicated' by a pal and sent back to camp 
for trying to start a fight in a club.

Mr Josic said police officers had asked him to drive Mr Cottrell home at about 2am.

Mr Josic, who was working for Poole 
Radio Cabs, explained the fare for the 17 mile journey back to Bovingdon
Camp would cost £50.

Officers had found £15 in notes on Matthew and he later discovered a further £7 pounds in change in his pockets.

Scene of the accident: The young man was walking home along the A35 road near Poole, Dorset on June 23 when he was knocked down and killed

'The
police said "just get him out of Poole",' said Mr Jovic, who explained 
to the officers that Matthew did not have enough money for the fare.

It
was agreed that the taxi driver would take him as far as he could 
before leaving the soldier to walk the rest of the distance.

He said: 'When it was £15 on the metre I pulled into a layby.

'I didn't think he was vulnerable and as a squaddie and I thought he would be used to walking long distances on foot.

'As he got out he said something like "we defend this country and nobody cares about us".'

Matthew got out of the taxi on the 
A35 road between Poole and Bere Regis.

The inquest heard Mr Cottrell was seen by several motorists walking with the flow of the traffic on the side of the A35.

The inquest in Bournemouth, Dorset, heard that the busy stretch of road had no lighting or pavement.

Matthew,
who was described as wearing dark clothing, was seen by a number of 
motorists walking in the same direction as the traffic using his mobile 
phone to light the route.

Kenneth Baker, 55, who was driving the Excelsior coach, said he moved slightly towards the kerb to avoid an oncoming lorry when he struck Mr Cottrell.

Tributes: The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death

He said: 'I saw what I think was an arm, as I saw this I hit something on the front passenger side of the coach.

'There was a bang and the windscreen on the same side broke.'

Mr Baker, who was driving the empty 53-seater, said: 'I have never seen anybody walking along that road.'

One motorist described having to take evasive action as the soldier appeared to stumble into the road others saw a man running.

Paul
Byres was driving a Royal Mail delivery lorry. He told the inquest how,
as he travelled along the A35, he became aware of a large vehicle 
travelling towards him in the opposite direction.

'As I got close to the up coming vehicle I saw an arm to the right of the coach,' said the HGV driver.

'I saw the person but I didn't have time to flash a warning.'

A taxi carrying three of Matthew's pals stopped at the scene and tried to resuscitate their friend.

The soldier's body was so bloodied that at first none of them recognised him.

Sapper Kristopher Knight described the moment he came across his colleague's lifeless body in the road a few minutes later.

He said: 'Our taxi was flagged down by the police officer who said there was a body in the road.

'I
could see a body on his back and near the verge. The male was wearing 
dark clothing and there was a big pool of blood by his head. I didn't 
realise it was Matt because of the blood.

'There was no pulse. I attempted resuscitation and carried on doing first aid and then the ambulance crew took over.

'I only thought it was Matt when we were doing the first aid but couldn't be sure because of all the blood.'

Major Barnaby Gray, based at Bovington camp, explained that the army had a policy to reimburse taxi drivers if soldiers had no money for their fares.

He said: 'It's not something we like to advertise because we don't want it to be taken advantage of.

'There is a small pot of cash held in the guard room for that purpose.'

Mr Josic said he did not think that any taxi driver in the area was aware of this policy.

A post mortem examination revealed Mr Cottrell, from Southport, Merseyside, died from multiple injuries, including a fractured skull.

He was three times the drink-drive limit at the time.

PC John Heywood, a police accident investigator, said the coach was travelling at between 47mph to 49mph and that no blame was attached to the driver.

A post mortem examination found Matthew had suffered severe head injuries in the impact and died at the scene.

At the time of his death he was three-and-a-half times over the drink-drive limit.

Accident investigations concluded that coach driver Mr Baker had no time to react to the presence of Matthew.

Debbie Smith (left), 23, said she was disappointed that the taxi driver left her fiance on an unsafe road

Mr Sheriff Payne, the Bournemouth, Poole and East Dorset coroner, recorded a verdict of accidental death.

He said: 'This is a very sad accident. A sad aspect is his colleagues were following in a taxi and they were first on the scene.

'I'm concerned there is the availability of the barracks to pay to get soldiers back to camp and taxi drivers do not know about it.'

He added: 'I have heard from many people who use 
that stretch of road and they have no knowledge of pedestrians using it 
in daylight or at night.

'From my own knowledge it would be dangerous to attempt to walk along there even in daylight.

'I cannot fault Mr Baker's driving of the coach. He was behaving perfectly properly.

'He had never come across any hazard like that. This is a very sad accident.'

Afterwards Miss Smith, 24, said: 'I was disappointed that, as the coroner described, Matthew was dropped off on an unsafe road.

'I would hope under similar circumstances, morally, taxi drivers would drop people off somewhere safer in the future.'

Matthew's mother hugged coach driver Mr Baker outside the hearing.

Speaking
after the verdict his fiance Debbie Smith, aged 23 years, said: 'I am 
disappointed as the coroner described Matthew was dropped off by the 
taxi driver on such an unsafe road.

'In similar circumstances I would hope the taxi driver would have the morals to drop him off somewhere safer.'
