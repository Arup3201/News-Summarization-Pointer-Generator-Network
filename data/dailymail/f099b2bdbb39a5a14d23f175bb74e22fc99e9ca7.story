An early dose of pantomime was served up on Sunday night as Andy Murray and John McEnroe accounted for Tim Henman and Pat Cash in their spirited doubles exhibition at the O2 Arena.

Hopefully for Murray the Champions Tour is a long way off but he'll be well-prepared - and somewhat of a hit - after taking the court with the trio of serve and volley legends.

His partner McEnroe delivered with racquet throws, remonstrated with the umpire and also showed glimpses of the sublime touch that saw the American amass 77 singles and 71 doubles titles in his glittering career.

Murray drove himself to the arena after getting the call to arms as tournament organisers scrambled to pull together a replacement for the final when Roger Federer feared he would be unable to take the court for the season-ending final against Novak Djokovic.

After losing a less than serious singles showdown with Djokovic, the intensity was well and truly extracted from the arena when the doubles began with Murray again taking centre stage.

It was a rare chance for Murray's sense of humour to come out on a tennis court where the stakes are usually so high, and his class came to the fore when facing all three of the ageing stars - including McEnroe - on one side of the net for a rally.

And a young English tennis star could have been unearthed when Cash took a breather and handed his weapon to a ball girl, who dominated a rally before stroking a winner down the middle.

McEnroe said he was impressed with Murray's doubles skills, despite the light-hearted setting. 

'I think we could have done some damage in doubles,' said McEnroe of his team-mate. 'Thank you Andy for coming out today. To the people who stayed, much appreciated.' 

Murray paid tribute to his opponents and cohort as his season ended on a far more enjoyable note than the 6-0 6-1 lesson given to him on Thursday night by Federer in their final group match.

'John is a legend of the game,' he said. 'Tim is someone ... I followed always when I was growing up and he was really good to me when I joined the tour. Obviously Pat, a former Wimbledon champion ... it's just a pleasure to be on the court with these guys.'
