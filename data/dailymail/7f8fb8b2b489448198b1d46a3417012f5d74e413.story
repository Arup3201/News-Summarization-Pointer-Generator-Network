If they were slow starters on the property ladder, Tony and Cherie Blair are certainly making up for lost time.

After adding a seventh home to their portfolio only last September, they have already registered the purchase of property number eight.

Like the previous £1.35million house, cash was again paid when they snapped up a £600,000 cottage for the former prime minister’s younger sister, Sarah Blair.

The pretty woodland retreat – about a
mile from the Blairs’ Buckinghamshire mansion for which they paid 
£5.75million in 2008 – was bought three months ago on Valentine’s Day.

Land
Registry documents show it is owned jointly and ‘equally’ by Sarah and 
Cherie Blair.

The homes the Blairs bought for their children are also 
co-owned by Mrs Blair.

Nestling on the edge of a wood, the picture-postcard cottage has three bedrooms and an expansive lawn with views across the grounds to stately home Wotton House.

The cottage was sold by the Gladstone family, descendants of Victorian prime minister William Gladstone, who own Wotton House.

In 2011, the cottage was available to rent unfurnished for £1,350 a month.

An estate agent’s photographs showed spacious rooms decorated in buttermilk yellow, with wrought iron fireplaces and chandeliers.

Yesterday the cottage was swarming with builders carrying out a refurbishment.

Miss Blair, 56, was said to be abroad while the work was being done, and preparing for a freelance career in publishing.

She recently left her job as chief executive of a small London publishing house specialising in the field of equal opportunities.

Mr Blair, 60, is said to be protective of his sister, who is unmarried, has no children and shuns publicity.

He has said that they and their brother Bill were all very close and that he would often turn to his siblings for emotional support.

Until recently Miss Blair lived in a £450,000 flat in Islington, North London.

The Blairs also lived in Islington until the 1997 election when they moved to No 10 and sold their home only to see it rocket in value.

Now the combined estimated value of the eight properties in their portfolio is nearly £21million.

Mr Blair reputedly earns £20million a year from government advisory work, speeches and consultancy work and has amassed a fortune of up to £60million.

Yesterday, neither the Blairs nor Sarah Blair wished to comment.

Tony and Cherie Blair have come under fire after it emerged that their charities were given nearly £1million from the US government’s foreign aid budget.

The grants came while Mrs Blair’s friend Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and would have been responsible for the cash.

In December the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women was given £405,000.

In 2011, the African Governance Initiative, one of Mr Blair’s charities, was given £550,000.

The Blairs have denied their relationship with Mrs Clinton had anything to do with the awards.

But the National Taxpayers Union, a US campaign group, has called for an investigation, saying ‘more transparency is needed’.
