Billy Joe Saunders is set to fight for the vacant WBO world middleweight title, according to the sanctioning body’s president.

Saunders, who is ranked No 2 with the organisation, looked to have been overlooked after light-middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade announced his intention to move up a division.

But not only will the 25-year-old from Hatfield get his opportunity, he is also likely to have home advantage against Russia’s Matvey Korobov.

WBO president Paco Valcarvcel tweeted: ‘Demetrius Andrade will defend WBO 154lbs title. Looks like Korobov-Saunders will take place in England for the vacant 160lbs belt.’

The title is vacant after previous champion Peter Quillin refused to face Korobov, who lives in Florida.

The 31-year-old has won all 24 of his professional fights, four more than his prospective opponent.

Saunders had been expected to fight bitter British rival Chris Eubank Jnr in London on October 25 but revealed last week that Eubank Jnr had not signed the contract.

A deadline imposed by Saunders passed without an announcement, but it seems he will swerve the domestic dust-up for his chance of world honours.
