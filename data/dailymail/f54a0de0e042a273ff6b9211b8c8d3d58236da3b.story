Stacey Rambold, 54, was originally sentenced to just 30 days for allegedly grooming a troubled 14-year-old student for sex

Prosecutors in Montana are fighting to get a former teacher back behind bars after a judge sentenced him to just one month in prison for raping a 14-year-old girl who later committed suicide.

Stacey Dean Rambold, 54, was sentenced in August after he pleaded guilty and he was released from prison on probation the following next month.

The verdict of Judge Todd Baugh drew fierce criticism after he ruled that the victim, Cherice Morales, was more mature than her age and 'just as in control' of the relationship as the teacher.

That statement was mentioned in Friday's appeal filing by prosecutors.

The filing by the Montana Attorney General's Office said the sentencing by the district court did not meet the state's mandatory minimum sentence, reports CNN.

‘The circumstance of a 47-year-old teacher having sexual intercourse with his 14-year-old student is precisely such a circumstance warranting a mandatory minimum sentence,’ the court document said.

Prosecutors said the 10-year-prison sentence they had pushed for at trial would still be appropriate.

The Montana Attorney General's Office filed its appeal with the state Supreme Court. It is unclear when that appeal will be answered.

Just before her 17th birthday and while the case on still pending, Cherice Morales killed herself

Less than a month after his original sentence, Baugh admitted that he had made a mistake and tried to change his verdict. But the state Supreme Court barred him from a new ruling, saying he didn't have the legal standing to change a sentence.

Baugh has also tried to apologize for statements he made during the trial.

'I made some references to the victim's age and control,' he told CNN affiliate KTVQ. 'I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say at that point, but it didn't come out correct. What I said was demeaning to all women, not what I believe in and irrelevant to the sentencing.'

Rambold was arrested in 2008 after police and administrators at Billings Senior High School learned that he had targeted 14-year-old Cherice, a troubled freshman at the school, and groomed her for sex.

The school district had warned Rambold
four years earlier to avoid touching or being alone with female 
students, it was later revealed. The district paid Cherice's mother 
$96,000 as part of a wrongful death settlement.

The
teacher, who was then 49, was charged with three counts of sexual 
intercourse without consent and prosecutors allege he had an ongoing 
sexual relationship with the girl.

Just before her 17th birthday and while the case on still pending, Cherice killed herself.

The girl's mother, Auliea Hanlon, says that Rambold's sexual abuse was a 'major factor' in her daughter's suicide.

Following the girl's death, prosecutors were forced to defer prosecution. They agreed to dismiss the case if Rambold admitted to one count of rape and agreed to enter a three-stage sex offender treatment program.

Rambold, 54, faces another 10 years in prison after the Attorney General's Office filed an appeal on Friday

Her fault? Judge Todd Baugh ruled that Cherice was 'older than her chronological age' and that in listening to the girl's police interviews, he came to believe that she was in control of the relationship with her teacher

In December, prosecutors revived the 
case and re-filed charges after they learned that the teacher had been 
kicked out of the program for having unsupervised visits with minors.

Rambold's
defense lawyer said those minors were his family members.The attorney 
said Rambold was attending another treatment program and was considered a
low risk to re-offend.

Judge Baugh, 66, seemed to agree. He said that the former teacher's violations at the sex offender treatment program were not enough to warrant prosecution.

He also said that when he reviewed taped police interviews with Cherice and concluded that even though she was 35 years younger than Rambold and clearly troubled, she was 'as much in control of the situation' as the teacher.

Judge Baugh also said that Cherice was 'older than her chronological age' - which mitigated Rambold's crimes.

Cherice Hanlon's mother, stormed out of the courtroom when the judge handed down the ruling and shouted 'You people suck!' at the judge.

Fury: Auliea Hanlon, Cherice's mother, said Judge Baugh resorted to 'blaming the victim' and pointed out that her daughter wasn't even old enough to drive a car
