Investigation: Colour Sergeant Glen Hughes had 
planned to walk the same route planned by the EDL's leader for charity. 
He denies links to the group

The Ministry of Defence is investigating whether a serving Army NCO professed support for the English Defence League on social networks.

Colour Sergeant Glen Hughes had appealed for donations for a charity walk on Armed Forces Day from Westminster to Woolwich along the same route that had been planned by the leader of the far-Right group.

News of the plan has raised fears that there may be broader links between Armed Forces personnel and the EDL, despite the soldier's denials that he is linked to the organisation.

Serving Armed Forces personnel are allowed to be members of political parties and organisations but are banned from taking an active role in marches or demonstrations.

Racial and religious tensions are 
running high on the UK's streets since the brutal broad-daylight killing of Drummer Lee Rigby on a Woolwich Street last week.

There
 are fears that far-Right supporters and their opponents could clash 
today at a series of demonstrations planned at war memorials across the 
country.

Yesterday his 
family stressed that the young soldier would not have wanted violent 
attacks to be carried out in his name, and urged protesters to remain 
peaceful.

Sergeant Hughes, 
who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, has come under investigation 
after a series of tweets originating from his Twitter account apparently
 made reference to 'dirty Muslims', reports The Times.

In
 another tweet purportedly from his account that has since been deleted he apparently said: 
'@EDLTrobinson Being in the forces this is dangerous enough for me but 
f*** it, enough is enough #queen&country #EDL #seeyoumonday RT.'

The MoD said it was investigating to see if any rules had been broken.

A
 spokesman said: 'Individuals are free to join political parties but are
 expected to abide by our Values and Standards in all they do.

'Regular Service personnel are not to take any active part in the affairs of any political organisation, party or movement and they are not to participate in political marches or demonstrations.

'Racism of any kind is completely unacceptable. It impacts on operational effectiveness by damaging individual morale and team cohesion.'

Mission aborted: Colour Sergeant Hughes has 
since abandoned the planned walk and published a statement via the 
Ministry of Defence denouncing any links to the EDL and claiming his 
JustGiving page was hijacked

Tensions have been running high since Drummer Lee Rigby, left, was hacked to death last week. Right, the former Archbishop of Southwark Kevin McDonald and Imam Ali of the British Armed Forces lay a wreath in memory of Drummer Rigby with other religious leaders and MPs at Woolwich Barracks, South London

Colour Sergeant Hughes had planned to walk on June 29 from Westminster to the site where Drummer Rigby was murdered to raise money for Help For Heroes.

The was the exact same plan of EDL leader Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - who goes by the pseudonym Tommy Robinson - before the military charity announced it would refuse any donations from the far-Right group.

Last night the Sergeant Hughes 
revealed he had also abandoned the plan, but said he still intended to 
walk along a different route to raise money for the charity.

He wrote on the JustGiving page set up
 to raise funds for the walk: 'Due to the considerable amount of 
unwanted interest that my walk has drawn, I no longer intend to walk 
from Westminster to Woolwich but instead plan to walk elsewhere within 
the UK on Armed Forces Day.'

Colour Sergeant Hughes's plan comes amid fears that the EDL, whose members have been involved in a number of violent street protests in recent years, is gaining support among members of the Armed Forces.

At an EDL rally in Whitehall on Monday people in the crowds could be seen wearing military berets and Afghan and Iraq war medals.

Other social media accounts appear to show servicemen and women giving their support to the group and showing sympathy with its ideas.

The apparent links between Colour 
Sergeant Hughes were exposed by a tweet by Mr Yaxley-Lennon saying: 
'Army Sgt glen hughes is taking my place on the walk from Westminster to
 Woolwich.

'I will be 
walking with him could everyone donate, glen is a serving soldier, I 
will be carrying his refreshments and following his footsteps stick 2 
fingers up at political correctness and dig deep!'

The Times reported the tweet, but it appears to have been since deleted from Mr Yaxley-Lennon's Twitter profile.

Colour Sergeant Hughes has released a statement via the MoD denying any links to the EDL.

'I, CSgt Glenn Hughes, have never been a member of the English Defence League, nor have I ever supported them, nor do I agree with what they stand for,' he said.

'In the wake of the publicity surrounding the Westminster to Woolwich walk on Armed Forces Day, I planned to conduct my own walk to raise money for Help for Heroes. 

'In the last 24 hours I believe my Just Giving page has been re-published on social media against my will and in a manner that has brought my reputation into disrepute. 

'This is a malicious act conceived for political purpose entirely against my will and I am considering what action can be taken against those who have so shamelessly used my identity for their own purpose.'

Help For Heroes would not comment on whether it would accept donations from Colour Sergeant Hughes's charity walk.
