Electronic cigarettes could be included in the smoking ban in Wales, under proposals unveiled yesterday.

Ministers fear they glamorise smoking and act as a gateway to normal cigarettes.

Around one million Britons are thought to be using e-cigarettes, which are battery operated and look like regular cigarettes.

Wales is poised to become the first part of the UK to ban e-cigarettes in enclosed public places, as health ministers introduce a new proposal to a White Paper on health reform. They fear the devices, used by celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, are 'normalising' smoking

There are no plans to ban them in England, although yesterday the chief medical officer raised concerns about their safety.

E-cigs
 contain liquid nicotine which is released when the user inhales, giving
 a similar rush to cigarettes without harmful tobacco. But little 
research has been carried out into their risks.

Mark Drakeford, health minister in the Labour-run Welsh government, said he is afraid they are 'normalising' smoking again.

'We
 have spent 30 years creating a climate in this country where people 
understand that smoking is not glamorous or desirable,' said Mr 
Drakeford.

'We are 
concerned that e-cigarettes might reverse that tide and act as a gateway
 to conventional cigarettes.

'It contains nicotine, it's highly addictive
 and you might then find it easier to move on to conventional 
cigarettes.'

Welsh health minister Mark Drakeford said he wants to prevent a new generation becoming addicted to nicotine

He announced proposals to ban them in indoor public places 
such as pubs and restaurants. He also proposed a minimum price per alcohol unit of 50p.

'Alcohol and tobacco are major causes of persistent inequalities in health,' he added.

His
 proposals are in a white paper that has been put out for consultation. A
 spokesman for the Department of Health said there were no current plans
 to ban e-cigs in England.

However,
 Dame Sally Davies said: 'We are normalising e-cigarettes. If they were 
regulated as a medicine and we knew what was in them and the dose of 
nicotine, then they might play a useful role in stopping smoking. But 
they aren't, so at the moment we don't know their safety or the dose 
they deliver.

'Flavourings are often attractive to children – cookies and cream and bubblegum.

'They are sold rather cheaply and many are made in China, so I worry about what's in them.

'I am also worried about once again making smoking seem like a normal activity.'

E-cigs
 were first made available in 1963 but it is only in the last ten years 
they have become widely used. In 2009, the Food and Drugs Administration
 in the US found some contain chemicals that cause cancer known as 
tobacco-specific nitrosamines. Last year the World Health Organisation 
warned that the high levels of nicotine may cause addiction – which may 
lead users to switch to regular cigarettes.

France
 has pledged to ban  e-cigs in public places after the country's health 
agency warned about the possible side-effects of the nicotine content.

The British Medical Association said it has fears about safety and the high levels of nicotine.

But
 senior doctors from the Royal College of Physicians say if all smokers 
worldwide switched to e-cigs then five million deaths could be prevented
 every year.

E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices marketed as a way of helping people quit smoking

Electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices which simulates smoking.

The design was patented in 1963, and uses a heating element known as an atomiser that vaporises a liquid solution.

Some e-cigarettes contain a mixture of nicotine and flavourings, will others release a flavoured nicotine-free vapour.

They are sold in flavours like chocolate and strawberry that are banned in conventional cigarettes because of their appeal to young people.

The devices are largely designed to look like cigarette and are marketed as a method of helping people quit the habit.

But experts have widely debated the benefits of e-cigarettes.

A recent study by scientists at the University of California's Centre for Tobacco Control Research and Education in San Francisco has shown teenagers who use the battery powered devices are more likely to smoke traditional cigarettes and less likely to quit smoking, the research showed.

As the popularity of e-cigarettes - promoted as a way to help people quit smoking - increases, scientists have found that ‘the wild west marketing of e-cigarettes is not only encouraging youth to smoke them, but also it is promoting regular cigarette smoking among youth’.

'Despite claims that e-cigarettes are helping people quit smoking, we found that e-cigarettes were associated with more, not less, cigarette smoking among adolescents,’ said lead author of the study Lauren Dutra.

She added: ‘E-cigarettes are likely to be gateway devices for nicotine addiction among youth, opening up a whole new market for tobacco.’

A study of nearly 40,000 youngsters in the U.S. found that e-cigarette use among school students doubled between 2011 and 2012, from 3.1 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
