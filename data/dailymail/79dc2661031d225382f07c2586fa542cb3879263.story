Residents living along the Rocky River in Ohio were put on high alert this week as the ice jams broke up and caused scary amounts of ice and water to travel down stream.

Flood warnings were put in effect for many parts of Northeast Ohio, as free chunks of ice went flowing towards Lake Erie.

At the weekend some residents, mostly in the basin area, were told to prepare to evacuate.

CNN captured footage moments after the ice broke and started loudly hurtling away.

In a matter of moments, the frozen Rocky River in Ohio began to break and move

'You immediately think about the safety of those who are along the river as well as the property along the river,' Rocky River Mayor Pam Bobst told Fox 8.

'We have great concern because residents are living in that area, we have evacuated that area, we started that very early this morning.'

While the ice itself caused immediate harm, the problem was the affect it had on water levels, which rised dramitically.

'The thickness of the ice keeps the ice from moving out to the river, so it’s caused the moving river to flow outside of its banks,' said Lakewood Fire Chief Scott Gilman. 

The ice pushed water levels to break through the banks and flood some park areas

The Rocky River Fire Department were monitoring the situation.

'Absolutely, we have our rescue boats and exposure suits so we can work out in the cold water if need be and boats can access folks who end up with a high water problem,' said Rocky River Fire Chief Christopher Flynn.

Once the jam broke free, police sounded their sirens and went door to door to let residents know to leave the area if they were concerned.
