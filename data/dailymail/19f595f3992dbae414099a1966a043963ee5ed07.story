'Living in sin' turns out to be just 
what's needed for a happy marriage, according to results of a major 
study, released last week.

The American study upturned previous research - that couples who live together 
before marriage are more likely to split - with quite the opposite 
result.

The study revealed relationships can last eight years longer, if you cohabit before walking down the aisle.

Studies show that living together before marriage can make a relationship last eight years longer

This is great news for those considering moving in - but you still need to do a reality check first.

Push emotion to the side, put on your objective hat and see how many of the following you can honestly say 'yes' to.

If
 you can't answer 'yes' to the majority of these questions, I'd strongly
 advise you to give it a bit more time - or rethink entirely.

Absolutely must answer yes to:

1. Do they make you feel good about yourself and are you happier since you met them?

2. Are you able to be yourself?

3. Have
 you seen how they behave in all sorts of different situations: day to 
day, happy events, under pressure at work or from their family or 
friends? Did they cope well with these crises?

4. Are you similar in tastes, views, what you like doing?

5. Do
 you connect on at least three of these crucial connection points: 
chemistry (you fancy the pants off each other), compatibility (you share
 similar backgrounds and interests), common goals (you both want the 
same things from life), pace (you move at the same speed and are both 
'fast' or 'slow' people) and timing (you're both ready for commitment)?

6. Do you communicate well (or at least think you'll learn to in time)?

If the majority of your answers are 'no' Tracey smells trouble

7. Do
 you trust them to be faithful? If they go out alone or with mates, do 
they reassure you with details of who they saw, where they went, who 
they ran into?

8. Do you 
get on with each other's friends and families? If neither of you can 
bear each other's significant others, it's not a great sign.

9. Do
 you both want the same things from life at around the same time? Do you
 have similar aspirations and thoughts on marriage, kids and the future?

10. Does your gut instinct tell you it's right?

11. Do you like as well as love them?

Important to answer yes to:

1. Are they reliable?

2. Do you make decisions together?

3. Have
 you had a few arguments and happy with how you resolved them? The 
amount of arguments you're having isn't as relevant as how well you 
solve them.

4. Are you both able to admit when you're wrong?

5. Are
 they reasonably sorted psychologically? If they're excessively jealous,
 overprotective or battling with substance abuse (alcohol or drugs), 
solve the problem before moving in.

6. Are you both happy with the level of intimacy? Make sure sharing secrets, feelings, desires and anxieties isn't lopsided.

7. Do you laugh together, share the same sense of humour and can laugh at each other and yourselves without getting huffy?

8. Are you compatible sexually? If your libidos don't match, have you worked out a compromise you're both happy with?

9. Are
 you both happy with the amount of time spent together and apart? Is 
there a good balance between 'us' and 'me' on both sides?

10. Do
 you trust each other to keep promises? Not just to be faithful but to 
be trustworthy with money, stick around during bad times and generally 
do the right thing?

11. Can
 you live with each other's faults? Everyone has the odd annoying habit 
but if it really, really irritates you now, it's only going to get worse
 once living together.

12. Are
 you with each other because you want to be, not because you're 
biological clock is ticking or you're worried no-one else will want you?

Were
 the majority of your answers 'yes' or 'no'? Start packing if it's yes, 
hold off signing that rental agreement if there were more than a 
smattering of 'no's'.
