This horrific picture shows the aftermath of a drink-driving smash in which a brilliant college student died - the morning after he had been drinking.

Matthew Alston, 18, went out in his car to a friend’s house at 7am not realising he was still drunk from a party at his family home the night before.

As he sped down the road, he lost control of his black Vauxhall Corsa on a bend and ploughed head on into a Seat Toledo.

'He made a positive difference to so many': Matthew Alston, 18, crashed half a mile from his parents' house

Matthew, from Simonstone near Burnley, 
Lancashire, died at the scene as a result of multiple injuries and tests 
showed he was still double the drink drive limit.

The
Seat driver, a 38-year-old off duty traffic policewoman on her way home
from a shift, suffered serious leg injuries and had to quit her job due
to ill health. Her male colleague, 49, escaped with minor injuries.

After
the accident it emerged that Matthew had passed four A levels in A, B, C
and C grades which would have enabled him to take up a place on an 
international business studies course at Northumbria University.

Today
Matthew's devastated parents Andrew, 46, and Janet, 48, gave permission for Lancashire Police to release a picture of the mangled wreckage in the hope that it might prevent more people getting behind the wheel after drinking heavily the night before.

They have also released the wreckage of their son's car to Lancashire Police and Lancashire County Council to be shown to students around the area as a warning about the dangers of driving the morning after.

Police also hope the crushed car will act as an effective warning to others, and say they plan to breathalyse and drugs test thousands of 
drivers around the clock in the run-up to Christmas.

Company director Mr Alston and his wife said: 'Matthew died as a result of driving the morning after he had been out drinking alcohol with friends.

'He drove without realising the amount of alcohol still in his body. Later we discovered he had twice the legal drink drive limit still in his system.

'On that day, when we were told Matt had died, we were just in shock; in a daze. We were away and were told over the phone by a police officer.

'It was devastating. Matt was just a normal lad, we are a normal family; surely it wouldn’t happen to us, but it has.

'Matt had a massive amount of friends. He was so cheeky; Always laughing and joking. That’s something we’ll never have again.

'This "Morning After" campaign highlights the true effects of drinking and driving. Over 10,000 young people in Lancashire have seen the devastation of Matt’s car and have expressed genuine shock at the reality of how easily something like this can happen.

'We are just a normal family, surely it wouldn't happen to us, but it has.' Matthew's parents Janet and Andrew Alston want to prevent the same thing devastating other families

'Matt and his friends would always use taxis for nights out, but didn’t always think about the morning after. Please, just stop a second and think. You could still be over the limit. That could have a devastating consequence.

'Too many young drivers are getting behind the wheel when they still have alcohol in their system.

'As Matt’s parents we would urge you to really think about the morning after. Are you really sure you’re fit to drive?  It’s not worth the risk so don’t even chance it.'

The tragedy occurred in August 2010 after Matthew hosted a party for ten friends at his family home whilst his parents were away for the weekend.

He went to bed in the early hours but got up at 7am because he couldn’t sleep and drove off without telling anyone where he was going.

At 7.10am half a mile away from the house, witnesses said the Vauxhall Corsa was speeding when it careered into the centre of the road, spun out of control and smashed into the Seat Toledo travelling in the opposite direction.

A coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Mr Alston added: 'Tragically Matthew made a grave mistake and if he was here today he would stand up and apologise to everyone for the hurt and trauma he had caused.

'He would have accepted the consequences and learnt from it never to repeat the actions again.  Those who have never met Matthew will form opinions based on the last few hours of his life.

'However those of us who had the privilege of knowing and loving him knew what a fantastic, young person he was who lived his life to the full, had a great work ethic, was caring and thoughtful with a wicked sense of humour.

'He made a positive difference to many, and would have continued to do so if he was with us today. Sadly he has gone too soon.'

Supt Richard Morgan from Lancashire Police said this year’s anti drink driving campaign would target drink and or drug drivers under 25 and those who drive the morning after a night drinking.

He added: 'People may be surprised to hear that last year between the hours of 6am and 11am nationally more than 400 people failed breath tests which is more than those caught for the hour before or after midnight.

'Drivers need to be aware that regardless of the time of day they are caught, whether they are going to work or taking children to school, they will face the same penalties as someone who has chosen to drink heavily in a pub and driven at night.

'Last year 280 people were killed across the country in accidents where the driver was over the limit. ‘If you don’t drink and drive this Christmas you reduce the risk of killing an innocent person, or yourself. It is really that simple.

'This year we are very grateful for the support of two parents who continue to grieve for their son Matthew who was killed in a collision after drink-driving. They are trying to save someone else from the pain they have endured.

'I would like people to listen to their words and consider the consequences of drinking and driving.

'Like Matthew, there are some drivers who think they are obeying the law but are in fact breaking it by getting into their cars the morning after a night of drinking.'
