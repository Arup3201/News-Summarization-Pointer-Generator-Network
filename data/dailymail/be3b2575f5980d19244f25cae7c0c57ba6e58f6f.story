A blind man fell onto the tracks at a subway station as a train was arriving in Los Angeles yesterday, but escaped unharmed by lying flat as the cars screeched to a halt above him.

The 47-year-old Los Angeles man was using his cane to feel his way to the edge of the platform when he fell onto the line at Wilshire and Vermont in the city's 
Koreatown neighborhood as a Red Line train was rushing into the station.

The train operator blew its horn, but 
by the time he could stop the train, the second car had passed over the 
man, Gonzales said.

'[The train] ran over the man but didn't touch him, thank God,' LA Metro spokesman Paul Gonzales said. 'In my view this is a miraculous occurrence. The man is exceedingly lucky to be alive.'

The man, whose identity was not released, had 'no obvious injuries' and was not touched by the train, but he was taken to a hospital as a precaution, Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Katherine Main said.

Graham Purvis, of Santa Monica, who was in the second car of the Red Line train, told the Los Angeles Times: 'I got sort of a sick feeling,' Purvis said. 'I wanted to look, but also didn't.'

Another passenger peered under the train, he said, and indicated that the man might have survived.

'But we didn't know for sure,' Purvis said. 'The whole thing - I was quite shocked.'

This is at least the third time since 
September 2012 that a train on the Red Line has passed over a person. In
 the other two instances, the people were seriously injured.
