They are both royalty, of sorts.

She is the niece of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, while he is touted as one of the most outstanding England batsmen of his generation, whose cricketer grandfather remains an icon to lovers of the game.

Stepping out for the first time as a couple this week, Lady Kitty Spencer and Nick Compton – grandson of the legendary Denis - made a dazzling couple – impossibly good looking, blue-eyed, tousled blondes.

And far from being concerned that Kitty might have inherited her family’s marital curse (her father, Earl Spencer, has of late married his third wife and fathered his seventh child), Nick’s family have welcomed her with open arms.

Kitty Spencer and boyfriend Nick Compton have kept their romance under wraps until now, but Nick's mother says it began last year

The pair appeared happy and in love when they appeared at a cricketing awards dinner at Lord's last week in their first public confirmation of their romance

Speaking exclusively to Mail Online from her home in Durban, South Africa, the mother of the 29-year-old sports star, who was England’s leading run scorer last year and was this week named by Wisden as their cricketer of the year, described Prince William’s pretty cousin as ‘bright, funny, down-to-earth – without any airs and graces’.

British-born Glynis Compton, a newspaper sub-editor, revealed that the pair had been dating since September last year and Lady Kitty, 22, had already flown over to meet her and husband Richard.

For his part, Nick who was born in South Africa but educated at upper-crust English public school Harrow, has visited the Spencer’s ancestral home, Althorp in Northamptonshire, and told his parents that he was ‘blown away’.

‘He said it was unbelievable….magnificent,’ Mrs Compton said.

Spirited aristocratic beauty Kitty was raised in Cape Town after her mother, former model Victoria Lockwood’s, marriage to Earl Spencer acrimoniously broke down in the face of his infidelity as well as her own eating disorder and battles with alcohol and drug addictions.

Ironically, however, Kitty, who has been named as one of the eligible girls in the country by society bible Tatler, and Nick did not meet until she came to England last year to study for an MA in luxury brand management.

The pair were introduced by a mutual friend from Cape Town and hit it off straight away, exchanging flirty messages on the social networking site Twitter with Lady Kitty teasingly calling her new man ‘granddad’ due to their seven-year age gap.

‘They’ve only known each other for a short while, since September or October last year and I have no idea where their relationship is going. But they have seemed to have carried on [to the next level],’ Mr Compton’s mother said.

The family met Lady Kitty for the first time over Christmas when she joined Nick at their family holiday cottage in Knysna, on the picturesque Garden Route, for the Compton family’s annual holiday.

Apparently she drove down from Cape Town by herself to spend time with them. A friend said: ‘For her to do that she has to be super keen on him. For Kitty that’s like driving across Africa…’

‘I was really impressed. She’s very bright, she’s cheerful, down to earth and funny. And she’s stunning looking and very natural,’ Mrs Compton, who gave the Mail this photograph taken during that holiday, recalled.

Nick is touted as one of the most outstanding England batsmen of his generation

‘She’s different, a really lively character who is interested in things and interesting to talk to. She’s had a completely different upbringing to Nick and that must be difficult to cope with but it doesn’t show. She’s got no airs or graces. I really like her.’

Asked whether her son was ‘keen on Kitty’, Mrs Compton said with the kind of toe-curling candour only a mother can: ‘Of course he is keen on her! He hasn’t had many girlfriends because he’s always been really focussed on his cricket and hasn’t had time for relationships. But he is still with Kitty… ‘

But she insisted her genial son, who is known as a gentleman both and on and off the field, wasn’t fazed by her status or aristocratic lineage.

‘No, Nick is a very down to earth person. He’s completely honest and straight. He says what he thinks. So I don’t think it really matters at all,’ she said.

Nick's grandfather, Denis, right, is a sporting legend while Kitty's Aunt is the late Princess Diana, right

‘Nick has also never shied away from the cameras. He’s very easy going in TV interviews, very good at talking to people and always outgoing.

‘They do look the part don’t they? They look comfortable together. They are quite different in some ways… their backgrounds are very different… but they make each other laugh and he feels very comfortable in her company.’

She added laughing:  ‘Her dad is also very keen on cricket so that counts.

‘Nick’s met her family, but I have no idea if they approve. I haven’t met them, but they seem like very nice people. Nick really likes them.’

Lady Kitty should also be impressed by Nick’s own, some might say more illustrious, family lineage.

Lady Kitty Spencer is a first cousin of the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry

His grandfather, Denis, played 78 Tests for England  - as well being a top class footballer, playing in the FA cup for Arsenal in 1950 and taking a winner’s medal.

Sixty years ago this summer he hit the run that won the Ashes for England – and his grandson is tipped to help his country retain the series this year.

He has also inherited his grandfather’s model looks. Denis was dubbed the Brylcreem Boy after advertising the brand and Nick is cutting quite a dash himself off the field, too.

So could Kitty be ‘the one’, then?

‘I think it might be a bit too early to say that,’ his mother said.

‘Nick is probably going to kill me [for saying all this]!’
