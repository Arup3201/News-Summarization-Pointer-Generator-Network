Shelley Faulkner, 27, from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, was warned she might be permanently paralysed after a dramatic car crash

An artist who was told she would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair after her car flew out of control on an icy road has astonished her doctors by walking just a few months later.

Shelley Faulkner, 27, suffered massive spinal injuries and a broken arm when her car skidded and rolled twice before hitting a tree on a frost road near Alcester, Warwickshire, last November.

She was told she was lucky to be alive but would probably be permanently paralysed after medics discovered two of her vertebrae had fused together in the 53mph smash.

Miss Faulkner's parents started looking into getting 24-hour carers and converting the ground floor of their house in Stratford-upon-Avon into a wheelchair-accessible flat for her.

But only a week after the crash, the graduate was sitting up in bed and now, seven months later, she is walking again and starting a new degree.

Miss Faulkner, who only spent 11 days in hospital, despite undergoing three operations to put a metal plate into her arm and rods and pins into her neck, said: 'I feel like I'm living a second life.

'I should only have had two options - complete paralysis or death.

'With every step I took, it felt like I was on the road to recovery - each one was a little miracle to me.'

She was driving to work at a gallery, taking care not to rush because of the icy conditions, when she lost control changing gears and her car skidded on frozen mud or leaves.

Miss Faulkner said: 'My
 car spun on its wheels and I ended up in a field after having hit a 
tree, killed a pigeon, gone through a ditch, rolled my car and smashed 
the driver’s side window with my head.'

She put her surprise recovery down to the quick thinking of passers-by, Andy Freke and Lisa Richardson, who called paramedics and helped keep her awake until they arrived.

Miss Faulkner said: 'Andy parked his truck across the road and took control of everything.  He rang for the ambulance, made sure I stayed awake and didn't move.

'If you listen to the 999 call in the background you can hear me screaming, but I've been told that's a good thing because if you're screaming you're breathing.'

Recovery: Miss Faulkner, an artist, had to have a 'halo' drilled into her head to support her spine as it mended

She said: 'When I came to, I tried to get out of my seat but Andy told me to stay still. If he hadn’t have done that, I would have done more damage and it could have killed me.'

Firefighters cut her out of the wrecked car and she was rushed to the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, before being transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham in a critical condition.

Miss Faulkner said: 'I was told I was very lucky to be alive and would 
probably be paralysed.  My step-dad starting looking into turning downstairs into a place for me to live, and was thinking about how they could provide 24-hour care.

'But I was just so determined to try and walk 
again.  What the doctors said spurred me on.'

She added: 'There was a lot of blood. I have no idea how my mum managed to get it all out of my scarf, but it's blue again now.'

Recovery: Miss Faulkner was in hospital for just 11 days, during which time she underwent three operations

Rehabilitation: The artist had to have intense physio and occupational therapy to strengthen her arms

Miss Faulkner had to undergo months of physio and rehab, and it is still ongoing, but she said the idea that she 'should' be dead or paralysed spurred her on.

Immediately after the crash, she had to wear a ‘halo’ – which was drilled into her head to support her spine – for seven days and lie perfectly flat to avoid her neck being broken.

She through a straw lying down until her neck was strong enough to allow her to sit up in bed, and after she was discharged from hospital she was visited by a physiotherapist every day and ordered to do hours of gruelling exercises.

She said: 'It was hell, but I was just grateful to be alive.

'There were times when I felt quite low because my body was a lot weaker than it had been before but I just carried on taking the extra step every day and doing the little exercises to build up my arm and back again.

'The thing that spurred me on was the thought that I had been given a second chance.'

Keep going: Miss Faulkner now wants to train as an occupational therapist to help others who are injured

During her months of physio and rehab, Miss Faulkner decided to change her career, swapping art for training as an occupational therapist.

She said: 'I had to basically train my body to do everything again, even putting on my bra was hard work, but when I managed it for the first time I wanted to celebrate because it meant that my arm was able to bend more than it could before.

'While I was doing that, I thought that I would like to train as an occupational therapist to help other people.'

As a result, she will start a university course in occupational therapy in Bristol in September.

She said: 'I’ve still got a long way to go until I can go to the gym and swimming again but I’m determined to get stronger, I'm walking again, and I feel stronger each day.'

She added: 'I wouldn’t wish the accident itself on anyone but I’ve got so much out of the recovery that in a way, I'm quite grateful for it.'
