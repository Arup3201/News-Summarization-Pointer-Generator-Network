Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne netted a winner during a local fishing event near his home in Dorset.

The troubled star, who was recently treated in hospital after being found staggering in the street during an alcoholic relapse, was seen chatting with fellow anglers at a private event in Boscombe Bay.

He left three hours later clutching his one prized catch, before being taken home in the same taxi which dropped him off.

But, despite leaving with a fish, Gazza's mood appeared to be a far cry from his jubilant manner during another fishing excursion last week.

Former England footballer Paul Gasgoine went along to a local fishing event in Dorset on Saturday 

The 47-year-old was seen leaving the lake near Boscombe Bay with one lone fish after three hours of fishing

The ex-footballer looked somber as he left Saturday's event, wearing aviator-style sunglasses and carrying his lone fish.

A week earlier, the 47-year-old had been seen beaming as he reeled in two huge trouts during an outing with a friend to a trout farm near Fordingbridge, Hampshire.

But on both occasions, the star was looking in much better health, compared to pictures taken in August.

Those shocking images showed him clutching a bottle of gin in the street near his rented apartment in Sandbanks, Poole.

He was seen wandering the streets outside his expensive apartment block, holding a carrier bag full of cans of Stella Artois, and sitting with his head in his hands.

After that, Gazza was taken to hospital when neighbours called 999 for help after finding the midfielder slumped against a wall. An ambulance arrived to take the former England star to hospital.

When those pictures emerged - showing him looking gaunt with sunken eyes - QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who also lives Sandbanks, offered him the chance to work alongside him in football.

He said: 'I saw him about a month ago and said "I'll pick you up in the mornings, Gazza, come training with me and do a bit of work with the kids". I’d love it if he could do that. It's an open invitation.

'He's a great lad and it's sad to see what’s happened to him and how he's looking at the moment.'

Catch of the day: Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne netted two huge fish during an outing with a friend in Hampshire last week

He clearly has a knack for the sport, having reeled in two trouts last week 

In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him.

He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having found been unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky.

Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago.

Last month, he was seen crashing a golf buggy into a ditch after losing control of the 15mpg vehicle at the Playgolf course in Bournemouth.

He was said to be dazed but unhurt after the incident.

Days later he was photographed cradling a chicken at a pub in Hampshire, and the next day apparently being turned away from an off-licence in Poole.

During the trip in Hampshire, the star appeared to be toasting his success on the water with a lager, apparently sipping from a can of Stella Artois beer

For the past four years, Gascoigne has been living in Poole, where he is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation centre, but was reportedly due to be evicted from his penthouse flat earlier this month after a string of disturbances.

The director of the management company in charge of the flats has dismissed claims he is being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract.

On September 10, he was arrested for allegedly throwing a brick at a van outside his home in Sandbanks and questioned on suspicion of criminal damage. It is believed it followed an altercation with a photographer.

He was released on bail until October pending further enquiries

Can: Fellow fishermen said he had pulled the can from a blue bag bearing the slogan 'Keep Calm And Carry', but had just stuck to one beer, and appeared to be sober

In 2010, he called a radio station to inform them he was off to search for fugitive Raoul Moat while he was hiding from police officers, taking with him a fishing rod, lager and some chicken.

He later admitted he did not realise that the former bouncer had shot a police officer in the face and admitted he feels 'guilty' about the incident.

Moat died following a stand-off with police. Gascoigne said in a radio interview at the time: 'He is willing to give in now. I just want to give him some therapy and say "come on Moaty, it's Gazza."'

He later told the Daily Express: 'I thought I could take him fishing because stuff like that has worked on me. But his situation was different from mine.'

In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him.

Last year his friends DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani paid for Gascoigne to attend a rehab clinic in Arizona.

Hunter Davies, who co-wrote the former star's 2004 autobiography, said: 'He doesn’t even like alcohol. He hates the taste of it.

'I’ve been with him when he’s poured it into flower pots, because he finds it so revolting. But then he will get depressed, and just want to get obliterated.'

Despite his demons, he is still remembered fondly by fans of the clubs he played for - including Newcastle United, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough - for his brilliance on the pitch.

He starred in midfield for Terry Venables' England side during Euro 96, where his virtuoso goal against Scotland was topped off with an equally memorable celebration.

Six years earlier he was seen crying on the pitch after being booked in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany. The booking making him unable to play in the final.
