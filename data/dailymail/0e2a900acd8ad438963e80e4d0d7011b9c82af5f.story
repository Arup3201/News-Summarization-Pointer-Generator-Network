Employees at a Georgia restaurant owned by celebrity chef Paula Deen's brother came to work this morning, only to discover that Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House has been abruptly - and permanently- shut down.

The Savannah eatery, owned by Earl 'Bubba' Hiers Jr, announced its sudden closure on its website and Facebook page: 'Thank you for 10 great years. Uncle Bubba's is now closed.'

The staff at Uncle Bubba's reportedly received no advance notice of the move and only learned of the closure this morning when they showed up to find the sign gone and kitchen equipment being carted away.

Outraged people took to Facebook, riling against the management of the eatery for failing to come clean with the workers ahead of time that the establishment was going out of business.

Jaime Linn Puckett wrote that her mother had spent the past eight years working at Bubba's, and no one bothered to give her a call.

'My fiance also worked there no one call him, in fact a UB manager called him LAST NIGHT to get his availability for next week!' she fumed.

Puckett, who is six months pregnant, added that with her husband-to-be out of a job, she now has to work double shifts just to make ends meet.

'I hope Paula [Deen] enjoys that 75 million she just signed on while all employees of UB are left frantically searching for a job,' Miss Puckett wrote, referring to the former Food Network star's new multimillion-dollar restaurant that is expected to open in Tennessee.

Another commenter Jerry Calhoun piled on: 'It doesn't matter what may have happened, the fact that they had NO thought what so ever for the employees is absurd! They could have had called everyone in and announce, instead they post a sign. Cowards!'

The move was so sudden that just two days earlier, Uncle Bubba's took to Twitter to promote their $16.99 crab special, and later inquired of their 2,400 followers which was their favorite stew.  

It has been reported that there was police presence outside Uncle Bubba’s Thursday morning, and that some cars were turned away from the restaurant parking lot.

Savannah-Chatham Police Department spokesman Julian Miller clarified to MailOnline that the restaurant hired a single off-duty officer to provide security.

The New York-based public relations firm the Key Group shed light on the hasty closure Thursday afternoon, saying in a statement to Savannah Morning News that Mr Hiers has decided to shutter his eatery ‘in order to explore development options for the waterfront property on which the restaurant is located.’

According to the press release, employees will be provided with severance pay based on position and tenure, and efforts will be made to help find them comparable jobs.

Earl ‘Bubbe’ Hiers found himself embroiled in a controversy last year over allegations of racism, which ultimately contributed to his sister's dismissal from the Food Network. 

Last year, Lisa Jackson, a former general manager at the restaurant, sued Hiers and Deen, accusing them of discrimination and sexual harassment. However, the suit was dismissed in August.

The restaurant closure also comes less than two months after Uncle Bubba's was cited for significant health code violations, which earned it a ‘B‘ rating.
