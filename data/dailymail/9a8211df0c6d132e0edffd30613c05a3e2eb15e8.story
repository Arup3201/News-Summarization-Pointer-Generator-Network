Bondi Rescue lifeguards braved the dangerous surf conditions as heavy swells hit Australia's east coast on Wednesday.

The boys from the popular Australian television show were training at Bondi Beach, Sydney's eastern suburbs, when one of their jetskis got a little out of control.

The watercraft was stuck up on the rocks as lifesavers were forced to abandon it. Later, they made several attempts at moving the beached machine back to safety.

Earlier on Wednesday morning, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning with vigorous winds along the coastal fringe.

'Very heavy surf, which may lead to localised damage and coastal erosion, is forecast for the Hunter and southern parts of the mid north coast during Wednesday,' the bureau said.

'Beach conditions in these areas and for most of the remainder of the coast will be dangerous and people are advised to stay well away from the surf and surf exposed areas.'

The bureau has since reported that gale force winds and damaging surf conditions have eased.
