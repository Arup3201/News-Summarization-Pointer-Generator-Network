A 50ft inflatable whale model was today banned from the Royal Parks because it is ‘too religious’.

The Bible Society organisation wanted to hold a children’s fun day at Hyde Park and Greenwich Park in London - and use the huge exhibit to help tell the Old Testament story of Jonah and the Whale.

But park officials insisted they do not allow ‘events of a religious nature’ - despite the locations being owned by the Queen, who is the Church of England Supreme Governor and Bible Society patron.

Only six weeks ago the society, which 
exists to encourage Bible reading rather than as an evangelical group, 
was also banned from installing the life-sized PVC whale near Tower 
Bridge in central London.

On that occasion the Daily Telegraph reported
 that the management firm of Potters Fields claimed that under the terms
 of its lease it was ‘not allowed to have any events of a religious 
nature’.

James
 Catford, chief executive of the Bible Society, said today: ‘Our mission is 
about inviting everyone to experience Scripture and consider it 
thoughtfully - we offer the Bible to the world.

‘Telling
 the story of Jonah to children, inside a giant inflatable whale, is 
intended to be a free, fun event over the summer. The Bible is packed 
full with some of the greatest stories ever told.

‘We believe that every child is 
entitled to encounter the Bible. It's a matter of justice. We're not 
about proselytising. Children and adults are free to make up their own 
minds about the Bible.

'We can't see any reasonable basis for Royal Parks to discriminate against us in this way.’

The story of Jonah and the Whale sees Jonah refuse God's command that he preach repentance to the city of Nineveh, before trying to 'run away' by getting onboard a ship.

However, God sends a violent storm and Jonah is thrown into the sea before being swallowed by a whale. He stays in its belly for three days before being vomited onto dry land.

He then goes to Nineveh and warns the residents to confess their evil actions to God, or he will destroy their nation.

They believed Jonah and God forgave them, saving them from destruction.

But a Royal Parks spokesman said today: ‘We do 
not permit collective acts of worship or other religious observances in the Royal Parks, including the construction of structures with a 
religious significance.

‘We seek to strike a balance between the quiet relaxation that the parks provide and events which appeal to a wide audience.’

Officials told the Bible Society that they ‘do not permit collective acts of worship or other religious observances in the Royal Parks, either in their own right or as part of a demonstration’.

However, they added that exceptions are made each year for annual acts of remembrance at the regimental memorials in the parks, which have taken place since the First World War. 

It 
comes only five weeks after Prime Minister David Cameron caused 
controversy by claiming Britain was a ‘Christian country’ and that 
believers should be 'more evangelical' about their faith.
