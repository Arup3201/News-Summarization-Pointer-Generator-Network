Olympic gold medalist Lindsey Vonn conquered a difficult super-G race Sunday in Switzerland in her 64th women's World Cup win.

Just one day after the 30-year-old hit a rut downhill in the Engiadina course in St. Moritz, Vonn secured her record-extending 64th victory Sunday on the same course with a time of 1 minute, 23.55 seconds, according to ESPN.

Behind her was Austrian skier Anna Fenninger who finished within a second of Vonn.

Vonn told reporters in St. Moritz that the 'name of the game in super-G is having confidence,' NBC Olympic Talk reports.

After noting the skiers disappointment just 24 hours earlier, commentators called Vonn's ski tactics 'so veteran-like' as she raced down the course with an 'unbelievable lead.'

Vonn crossed the finish line with her arms raised and then threw one fist in the air as the crowd cheered at the famous Swiss resort.

'I tried to really push the limits and be smart in places where I knew there would be trouble,' Vonn told ESPN. 'Now I have a lot of confidence going into the world championships.'
