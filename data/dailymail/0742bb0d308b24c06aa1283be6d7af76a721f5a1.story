It was the place to be seen in Manchester when The Beatles played to packed houses, but the Hulme Hippodrome since fell into disrepair - now campaigners are hoping to raise enough cash to refurbish the Grade II-listed building.

Local youth campaigners want to see the building, which featured an ornate three-tier theatre, a ballroom and a restaurant, turned into an arts centre and hub for groups in the Manchester area.

Plans to restore the building, including the roof, could cost more than £20 million. Locals call it a 'monument to the area's past' and a hidden gem, which, when restored will once again become the place to go.

Potential: the colourful building would cost around £20 million to restore to its former glory

The Hulme Hippodrome was built in 1901 - it has withstood two world wars, but its potential is still obvious

The building opened in October 1901, 
when it was used as a music hall. It featured stunning gilded 
decorations, red velvet seats and a huge auditorium.

Stars, who also included Laurel and Hardy and Nina Simone performing at the 
3,000-seater theatre, were said to arrive there through tunnels leading 
into the city centre to avoid the public.

Among
 those helping to raise awareness and funds to have the building 
restored is the Youth Village, a not-for-profit enterprise.

Tony Wright, of Youth Village, says: 'The
 building needs to be saved. It is a beautiful piece of architecture in 
the North West and we are talking to English Heritage to have it 
upgraded from a Grade II listing to Grade II with a star which would 
give it more credence.

Stunning colours: reds, purple, organe, green, turqoise - the 1901 building is a treasure in the north west of England, according to locals

Well worn: ripped walls and and bird droppings visible all over, but the ornate railings and staircase still stand out

Dirty floors and dust - but the detailing of the Hulme Hippodrome in Manchester, like on this railing, is extraordinary

Nothing was left to detail when architects designed the Hulme Hippodrome - every piece of interior is carved and crafted

Youth volunteers help restore the building as much as they can, but, says Tony Wright of Youth Village: 'We would like to raise money and get it fully restored'

'The building has withstood two world wars and don't forget it's over a 100 years old - no wonder it looks a bit dusty. 

'We have between 20-100 volunteers who have been working on cleaning it up and making small repairs for a couple of years. But we'd like a lot of interest so we can get it properly repaired.'

Today Church group Deya Ministries have held services in the foyer area 
since buying the building in 1999.

They have leased the building, which is on the at risk register by Manchester Council, to Youth Village and will 
continue to use it while work goes on in the rest of the building.

A hidden gem: Manchester youth campaigners want to see it turned into a arts centre and a hub for the local community

Legroom: red velvet fabric covered the seats and and there were beautiful, dark and shiny tiles on the pilars

From here the audience could watch and listen to performers such as The Beatles, Nina Simone and Laurel and Hardy

When audiences dwindled the Hulme Hippodrome was turned into a bingo hall before closing in the 1980 - today community workers hope to raise at least £20 million to restore the building
