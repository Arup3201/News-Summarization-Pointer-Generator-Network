Think your commute is bad? Spare a thought for the small band of dedicated workers who live in Cornwall but work... in Shetland.

Their gruelling 900-mile journey from one end of the UK to the other is revealed in analysis by the Office for National Statistics – which has found the most exhausting trips made by Britain’s 11.3million commuters.

Some 175 Shetlanders work in other parts of Britain, with a further 494 journeying to their office in the remote northern isles from other parts of the country.

A study into commutes by the Office for National Statistics found some people travel from their homes in Cornwall (pictured) to the Shetland Islands on a regular basis for work

This includes three people who regularly head to the islands from Cornwall – which is 700 miles as the crow flies and about 900 miles by the shortest commute.

A handful travel to there from the South coast and London, with a further 195 people from across Britain regularly commuting to their workplace in Orkney.

The lure of jobs in London also pulls in commuters from far and wide. Of the 867,630 who travel to the capital for work, 285 come from Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 

Dozens even make the journey to London from the Highlands and Northern Ireland – plus two people from Orkney and one Shetlander.

The distance from Cornwall to the Shetland Islands (pictured) is 700 miles as the crow flies but 900 miles for the shortest commute. The lengthy journey takes at least 24 hours by car

Previous analysis found that the average commute in England and Wales increased from 8.3 miles in 2001 to 9.3 miles in 2011.

On average, workers in the East of England had the longest commute at 10.6 miles, while Londoners had the shortest commute at 6.8 miles. 

In both 2001 and 2011, men travelled further to work than women.
