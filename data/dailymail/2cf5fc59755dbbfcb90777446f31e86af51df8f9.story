Tragic: Martyn Uzzell, 51, died after hitting a pothole while cycling in North Yorkshire as part of a charity bike ride.

A 51-year-old cyclist was killed on a 
charity bike ride after riding over a pothole the council had failed 
to repair, an inquest heard.

Martyn Uzzell died instantly when he hit the 4in deep pothole on a main road and was thrown into the path of a car.

Only
 a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the 
pothole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided immediate 
repairs were not necessary.

Coroner
 Rob Turnbull told the inquest at Skipton Magistrates’ Court there was 
‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was
 the cause of the incident’.

He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’.

Yesterday
 Mr Uzzell’s widow Kate,  48, revealed she was pursuing a  compensation 
claim against North Yorkshire County Council after his ‘entirely 
avoidable’ death.

She said: 
‘It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed
 to go unrepaired. This should not have happened.

‘My
 husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, 
while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost 
him his life.’

The tragedy 
happened in June 2011 when Mr Uzzell, a service engineer, was cycling 
with two friends from Land’s End to John O’Groats to raise money for a 
cancer and children’s charity.

They
 were riding along the A65 road at Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, when Mr
 Uzzell hit the pothole and fell into the path of a VW Golf behind him. 
He suffered devastating head injuries.

After
 the coroner ruled his death was the result of a road traffic accident, 
Mrs Uzzell, of Clevedon, Somerset, said she wanted to know ‘why 
something wasn’t done’ when the council had been warned about the 
pothole.

Local authorities have a legal obligation to keep roads in a 
good state, but usually prioritise repairs according to how deep and 
dangerous potholes are.

Pothole: A section of the A65 Settle Bypass at Giggleswick, North 
Yorkshire. Mr Uzzell was travelling along this road when he swerved to hit a pothole and fell into the path of an oncoming car.

It 
is not known how deep the pothole was when inspected by council staff 
five weeks before the tragedy, the inquest heard.

Police had called the 
council’s customer service team to report the pothole, but the operator 
did not pass the information on to the highways department, the inquest 
heard.

However, a council 
inspection was carried out two days later and the hole was ruled not 
serious enough for immediate attention.

A further inspection was made of
 the road before the accident and again no action was taken.

Tribute: Mr Uzzell's wife Kate said he an experienced cyclist and who was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart

Mrs Uzzell said: ‘I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained.

‘My
 life has been devastated, I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a 
lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am lost and lonely without 
Martyn.

'And it isn’t just me, Martyn’s entire family is also suffering 
the loss of someone very special.’

Police confirmed Mr Uzzell and his 
group had cycled competently, travelling at a reasonable speed with a 
good distance from one another and were wearing appropriate clothing.

The Crown Prosecution Service decided the council failings did not constitute a criminal offence and refused to press charges.

Mrs
 Uzzell said: ‘I was devastated when the CPS told me they would not be 
prosecuting. My husband has died yet no one is being held to account as 
to how this was allowed to happen.’

Avoidable: At Skipton Magistrates' Court, Coroner Rob Turnball said there was 'no doubt whatsoever' that the condition of the road caused Mr Uzzell's death

North Yorkshire County Council said it would consider the coroner’s comments carefully and expressed sympathy.

Potholes,
 made worse by harsh winter weather, cause millions of pounds of damage 
to cars each year but are especially dangerous to cyclists.

Chris Peck, of the Cycling Touring Club, said: ‘They can cause injury and in some 
cases such as this, death.’
