HuffPost Live vide host Marc Lamont Hill is no stranger to controversy, but Twitter still erupted Wednesday when he blasted out admiring messages to Mumia Abu-Jamal, a Pennsylvania convict who murdered a Philadelphia police officer in 1981 in cold blood.

'Happy Birthday to my Brother @MumiaAbuJamal,' he wrote. 'So grateful to know him, write with him,and struggle for his release from unjust incarceration.'

Bosom buddies: Columbia Teachers College associate professor and HuffPost Live host Marc Lamont Hill (L) tweeted praise for cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal (R) on his 59th birthday

Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner died in 1981 when Mumia Abu-Jamal fired five bullets at him from a .38 caliber revolver that police found next to him. He was sentenced to death for first-degree murder, but a federal appeals court later reduced that sentence to life in prison

Abu-Jamal, born Wesley Cook, has a Twitter account. And the legal right, granted by a court, to write books for profit.

Hill, also an associate professor at Columbia University's Teachers College, co-authored one of those books with him in 2011.

'Mumia stands as one of the most important voices of his generation,' he wrote in a second tweet, 'one of the leading intellectuals, and reminder that unfreedom lingers.'

Angry tweeters, including a few notable names, responded.

Abu-Jamal's death sentence made him the international face of U.S. capital punishment, with liberal celebrities praising the killer and at least four foreign heads of state naming streets after him in protest

CBS Sports host John Kincade tweeted, 'don't forget MURDERER on that resume.'

And Neal Boortz, a National Radio Hall of Fame broadcaster, chimed in.

'Mumia Yabba Dabba Abu Jamal is no more an intellectual than a turd is a flower arrangement,' he wrote.

Boortz retired in January after 42 years of radio, and now publishes a daily podcast. His longtime tagline is 'Somebody's gotta say it!'

Undeterred, Hill, fired two more rounds out of his persuasion-gun.

'Mumia represents a cadre of prison intellectuals, who have articulate [sic] dangerous ideas from the dungeons of American prisons,' he insisted in another tweet.

'He also represents a murderer who took a good man from his wife and child,' retorted a conservative blogger, 'but Yay Killer.'

Before shifting gears to tweet about basketball, Hill offered one more shot.

'I stand with Mumia and fight for his freedom because I believe in his innocence,' he tweeted. 'I have no doubt that he is a political prisoner.'

Derek Hunter, a talk show host on WBAL Radio in Baltimore, offered his own version of this Twitter message -- corrected, he implied, to make it more honest.

'Fixed,' Hunter snarked, with an 'MT' for his modified tweet: 'I stand with Mumia and fight for his freedom because I don't care he shot a cop in the face, he's progressive!'

April 24 marked Abu-Jamal's birthday, an annual occasion for 'Free Mumia' rallies on college campuses and in urban city centers.

Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death for the murder of policeman Daniel Faulkner, but after 30 years on death row and the Supreme Court's refusal to overturn his conviction, a lower appeals court ruled that the jury was improperly instructed. In 2011 his death sentence was commuted to life in prison.

At trial, the evidence against Abu-Jamal included a .38 caliber revolver found next to him containing five spent cartridges, a shoulder holster he was wearing which fit the gun, bullet fragments in Faulkner's body that were consistent with that firearm, a bullet wound in his own body from Faulkner's service revolver, and three witnesses who saw the murder firsthand.

A hospital security guard and a Philadelphia police officer also testified that Abu-Jamal offered a spoken confession at the hospital where his wound was treated.

'I shot the motherf--ker,' he said, according to those witnesses, 'and I hope the motherf--ker dies.'

The annual 'Free Mumia' rally in Philadelphia focused in 2013 on criticizing the local District Attorney's office for maintaining its position that Abu-Jamal, seen here in 1994, killed a policeman in cold blood

Then working part-time as a cab driver, Abu-Jamal had parked his taxi across the street from where Faulkner was conducting a traffic stop of his younger brother's car. The court record shows that he crossed the street and emptied his gun into the officer.

Abu-Jamal, a co-founder of the Philadelphia chapter of the Black Panther Party, has become a socialist folk hero during his more than 30 years behind bars, recording audio messages every week for his supporters.

Upon the death of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, he praised the late dictator.

'For millions of Latin Americans,' according to Abu-Jamal, 'Chavez brought dignity to them by refusing to play the puppet for "El Norte," the U.S. empire. ... Viva Hugo Chavez!'

In 2013 the NAACP ran an online promotion to ask members to nominate their favorite 'Unsung Heroes of Black History.' Three members nominated Abu-Jamal. The organization has allowed those tributes to stand

His essays have been published by the Yale Law Journal. National Public Radio offered in 1994 to air three-minute commentaries from him once every month, but canceled the invitation after then-Senator Bob Dole of Kansas joined with the Fraternal Order of Police to publicly condemn the arrangement.

When Addison-Wesley, the educational published, agreed to publish Abu-Jamal's death row memoir in 1995, Daniel Faulkner's widow hired a message-towing airplane to fly over the company's headquarters with a banner that read, 'Addison-Wesley Supports a Cop Killer.'

In addition to his weekly audio commentaries on Prison Radio, Abu-Jamal writes regular columns for a Marxist magazine in Germany.

The Daily Caller reported that in an online promotion called '2013 Unsung Heroes of Black History,' the NAACP let stand three members' nominations of Abu-Jamal as their unsung heroes.

In 2011 after the release of a documentary movie that argued for his innocence, Fox News host Greg Gutfeld unleashed a scathing 90-second commentary.

'Mumia is global warming in a prison jumpsuit: cocktail conversation for cowards,' Gutfeld sniped. 'It's even odder that these tools crusade for gun control as they defend a cop killer. Screw 'em.'
