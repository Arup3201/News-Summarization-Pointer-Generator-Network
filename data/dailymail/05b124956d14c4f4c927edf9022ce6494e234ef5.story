Shares in the Royal Mail are set to soar in value, thanks to an overwhelming number of applications to buy stock in the company ahead of its privatisation.

Stockbrokers have announced that they will stay open over the weekend to cope with last-minute orders ahead of Tuesday’s application deadline.

The shares are expected to be valued at 330p each – and city analysts said the price could rise to as high as 450p.

The Royal Mail sale has attracted 
strong demand, with potential investors placing orders for all the 
shares within hours of its launch last week.

Market commentator David Buik at Panmure Gordon said: ‘It appears to be heavily oversubscribed.

‘Expectations are that Goldman will price the issue at the top end of the range at 330p due to heavy demand.’

Joe
Rundle, from trading firm ETX, said: ‘We have experienced high levels 
of demand from retail clients trying to get a piece of the action.’

A spokeswoman for Royal Mail declined to comment on the media report about the price.

But if it comes in at the higher end, this points to a bigger annual dividend payout for income-hungry buyers of the shares.

The Royal Mail sale has attracted strong demand, with potential investors placing orders for all the shares within hours of its launch last week.

Royal Mail's implied dividend yield 
for the year ending March 31, 2014 is calculated at between 6.1 per cent
and 7.7 per cent on the basis of the expected offer price range of 
between 260p and 330p per share and a notional full-year dividend of 
£200million in that financial year.

Order books are due to close on October 8, with the shares beginning conditional trading in London on October 11.

The privatisation of the near 500-year-old company could be one of Britain's most significant since John Major's Conservative government sold the railways in the 1990s.

It would give Royal Mail access to the private capital it says it needs to modernise and to compete in a thriving parcels market.

The government has said around 30 per cent of the shares on offer are expected to go to individual members of the public, who must spend a minimum of £750 to invest in the company.

Britain has also agreed to hand 10 per cent of Royal Mail's shares to staff in the largest share giveaway of any major UK privatisation. If distributed equally among the eligible 150,000 UK-based workers, each could receive £2,200 worth.

The sale has been criticised by the Labour party and by unions, which are balloting for strike action. However, the ballot will close after Royal Mail is due to make its market debut.

Goldman Sachs and UBS are running the sale of Royal Mail, and are also joint-bookrunners along with Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
