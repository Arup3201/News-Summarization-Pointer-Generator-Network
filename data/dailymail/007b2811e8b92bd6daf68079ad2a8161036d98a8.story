A black and yellow arrow is the vivid symbol of the International Rescue Committee. You will see it on flags flying over refugee camps from the Syrian borders to the Congo.

Yet it was the poison-tipped missile that thudded between David Miliband’s shoulder blades at the Labour leadership election which most informs his decision to abandon British politics for a place among New York’s glamorous charity elite. 

Younger brother Ed was the deceptively geeky assassin with the bow. He snatched the job David thought was his birthright.

'Took it personally': David's wife Louise Shackelton, left, believed Ed's wife Justine Thornton, right, should have done the right thing and put a stop to his efforts to become leader of the Labour party

The sight of the two Primrose Hill-raised Labour apparatchiks engaged in political fratricide was astonishing, and in the subsequent two-and-a-half years, no amount of fine public words or behind-the-scenes finessing has healed that wound.

Forget Ed’s almost tear-stained eulogies yesterday at the news his brother was  leaving British politics; forget mentor Tony Blair’s hope that ‘this is time out, not time over’; forget the $450,000 salary the Twittersphere was predicting for the new IRC boss; set aside even David Miliband’s own part-explanation that he was repaying a debt to an organisation formed in the 1930s to help people like his parents flee Nazi persecution.

Home ties: David Miliband's wife Louise Shackleton is American and their two children were adopted in the States

For the 47-year-old former Foreign Secretary and one-time No 10 hopeful, a new life along the Hudson rather than the Thames is about escaping Ed. Leaving Westminster wasn’t enough – only an ocean apart would do.

In an interview with the BBC yesterday, he hinted at this when he said it was ‘hard for me to accept that I can best help the Labour Party by giving not just the space between the front bench and the back bench to Ed, but the space between the front bench and 3,000 miles away’.

He went on: ‘I want it to be the vision Ed Miliband has versus the vision David Cameron has. Not Ed and David Miliband. I didn’t want to become a distraction. I didn’t want the soap opera to take over the real substance of what needs to be done.’

One Westminster source used rather blunter language: ‘He will never come back.’ Another added: ‘He knows in his heart of hearts he is finished here.’

So ends serious recent speculation that the fraternal schism could be healed for the good of the party, with the more experienced and charismatic Miliband brother returning to the Shadow Cabinet to turn a strong position into a winning one at the next general election.

According to several Westminster insiders, David Miliband’s decision was vigorously encouraged by his musician wife Louise Shackelton.

She is an American and their two children were both adopted in the States. But the most telling factor is her continued bitterness at the way in which her husband was ‘betrayed’ by his little brother.

‘The relationship between the two brothers has never really recovered, but the driving force is David’s wife Louise,’ an associate of David’s said.

‘She took it personally, and has not come to terms with it even slightly. Why should David go back into the Shadow Cabinet and improve things for Ed?

‘Louise feels that Ed’s wife Justine should have done the right thing and stopped her husband. Louise wants to get right out of the political “Primrose Hill mafia” set from which the brothers emerged, and New York is also a good base for her own orchestral work.’

And so the discord continues, giving the lie to Ed Miliband’s statement when he stood for the leadership that ‘David is my best friend in the world. I love him dearly but win or lose we will remain the best of friends’. Wrong!

‘Heartbroken’ both by the dashing of his ambitions and the person behind it, David stepped down from front-rank politics. In his resignation statement, he said he had done it to ‘give Ed the space ... he needed to lead the party without distraction’.

Discord: David said he had quit politics to give his brother Ed, right, 'space' to lead the Labour party

It had done little to soothe his feelings to hear the victorious Ed declare that Britain had not ‘heard the last’ of David, and that he would be ‘around in one way or another’.

Like Banquo’s ghost at the feast, it seemed. The lasting damage became clear with the publication of the first biography of the new leader, Ed: The Milibands And The Making Of A Labour Leader. Written by two Left-wing writers, it was an uncompromising picture of the schism which made uncomfortable reading for all concerned. Among the book’s revelations was that David’s wife had cut Ed dead when they met behind the scenes following his unexpected victory.

The book also suggested that the brothers’ mother, Marion, was ‘devastated’ by the rift and wished she had persuaded her younger son not to have stood. And the brothers, who once spoke several times a week, largely communicated through their offices.

There were also revelations about the smears – Ed was dubbed a ‘Bennite’, ‘Red Ed’ and ‘Forrest Gump’ – supporters of both brothers waged in the run-up to the ballot.

There was a public coming together for Ed’s marriage to lawyer Justine Thornton in May 2011. Then David tweeted: ‘Great day for Ed and Justine. They look very happy – congratulations from all the Milibands.’ Tellingly, though, David and Louise did not attend the reception at Ed’s north London home.

But if David was devastated at this political assassination, he discovered that having more time on his hands could be lucrative. He embarked on the international lecture circuit, and took on ‘advisory’ roles, earning £70,000 for three-and-a-half days work with a Californian eco-technology company.

And even as his brother struggled to impose a credible leadership, there were signs that the David Miliband camp was still manoeuvring for position.

Leaks to the Guardian, which had supported David’s leadership bid, were a clear sign – such as the publication of emails which showed that the two Eds, Miliband and Balls, had plotted to oust Blair after Labour’s 2005 election victory.

While David told Jeremy Paxman he no longer dreamed of being Prime Minister, his supporters privately suggested that he was biding his time. Unlike Ed, he would not throw down a direct challenge to a brother. But he would step in if other forces conspired to ensure that Ed lost the leadership.

Brothers at war: The first autobiography of Ed Miliband made for uncomfortable reading

Today, with the Coalition in some disarray and Labour with a double-figure lead in the polls, that eventuality seems more unlikely.

As one ally said yesterday: ‘David does not want to stand still any longer.’ Of course Miliband senior’s departure represents more than simply the end of his own ambitions here. Some have called it the final curtain on the New Labour project.

As one insider said: ‘The New Labour corpse was just about twitching with David Miliband still around on the back benches, but that’s the end of it now.’

What’s left, of course, is a Labour Party ever more in hock to the unions, and with policies that seem designed to drag it away from the centre ground. So could David still have enough of a passion for politics to return from America and throw down the gauntlet once more?

‘It would be too weird for one Miliband to take over from another,’ says the source. ‘It would make Labour look like North Korea. And you have to remember that David Miliband is older than David Cameron.

‘Anyway, he is sick of the whole soap opera, psycho-drama that a minor role in British politics brings. I never thought he would stay until the next election. A former Foreign Secretary as back bench MP for South Shields? I don’t think so.’

And so the future lies westwards.

Like Blair before him, David Miliband is using the contacts he made in his former life to forge a lucrative future. One in which he might still wield real power. ‘Everyone thinks the Clintons sorted his new job for him, and you would think David will be heavily involved in Hillary’s presidential election campaign in 2016,’ said another Westminster source.

‘She and David had a real chemistry when he was Foreign Secretary. She admitted she had a crush on him and could end up giving him an important job.

‘What price David Miliband in a senior role in the White House and Ed Miliband in No 10? Stranger things have happened in politics.’

But none that come quickly to mind.

A new chapter in the David Miliband story begins, but the sibling rivalry continues unabated.
