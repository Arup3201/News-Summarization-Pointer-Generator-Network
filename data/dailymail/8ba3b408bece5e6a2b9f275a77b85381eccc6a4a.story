You might expect electronics or toys to be at the top of a nine-year-old's Christmas list, but a boy from Connecticut asked Santa for only one thing: that his grandfather would get the day off work.

To the shock of Julian Otero's family, his grandfather's boss at Madison Beach Hotel in Madison granted his wish, so Leo Otero will be able to have Christmas dinner with his loved ones. 

'Dear Santa,' Julian's letter read. 'My greatest wish is that you talk to my grandfather's boss, Mr John Mathers, and ask him if he could give my grandfather Christmas Day off.

'I would like it if he could be with his grandkids and family. Thank you Santa and tell Mr Mathers thank you as well.'

Kindness: Leo Ortero, right, does not have to work Christmas Day after his grandson Julian, left with his mother and brother, wrote a letter to Santa requesting he got the day off from work

Plea: Julian penned this letter to Santa asking if his grandfather's boss would give him the day off

He signed the letter from himself and fellow relatives - and also managed to squeeze in an extra line that read: 'P.S. If you have time and think I earned it, I would also love an Xbox 360.' 

Julian gave his letter to his mother to mail for him - but she handed it to his grandfather, who took it to the Madison Beach Hotel and showed it to Mathers, the general manager.

'It's real touching and being that he's my older grandson, I had to do something,' Otero told KFOR.

Mathers said he agreed something had to be done about the letter.

'We immediately drafted the memo in response,' he told ABC News.  

'I received a phone call from the North Pole this morning asking me to contact Santa on his private cell phone,' read the letter written to Leo Otero, Julian's grandfather.

Response: The hotel staff sent a letter back to Mr Ortero, saying they had heard from Santa

Happy to help: His boss, John Mathers, said it is the first direct request he has ever had from Santa

'I called him and he was concerned that you were planning to work on Christmas day... I think it would be best if you planned to take the day off and spend it with your family. Work can wait until after Christmas!' 

He added: 'P.S. Did you know that Julian wants an Xbox 360? Santa is not sure he's ready for such a fancy toy.'

Speaking to KFOR, Mathers added: 'This is the first time I've had a direct intervention from Santa Claus himself.' 

Mr Otero said he was relieved by the response and is looking forward to spending the day with his grandchildren.
