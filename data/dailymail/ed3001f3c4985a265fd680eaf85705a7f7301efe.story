Some 32 wagons derailed and 14 exploded in a massive fireball at a railway station in the city of Kirov, around 500 miles north east of Moscow.

Officials insisted later there was no risk to life and no injuries from the inferno.

'People are worried, because they believe that gas is what they may get poisoned from, but in fact gas condensate is a liquid and there is no danger of poisoning,' said Kirov regional emergency ministry spokesman Aleksey Neustroyev. 

The carriages were carrying gas condensate and the fire was spared by a broken overhead power line, said Russian authorities.

'As a result of fire 32 wagons derailed and gas condensate spilled,' said the Russian Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI.

'Dwellers of neighbouring houses and workers at a bakery were evacuated. No people were hurt in the incident', the committee said.

A probe is underway based on health and safety violations on the railway.

As many as 700 residents had to be evacuated, according to reports from the scene.

The fire engulfed several timber buildings and there were reports that a five floor apartment block was totally destroyed.

The incident began at 4.44 am today and took firefighters five hours to get it under control, though the fire continued to burn.

Evacuated locals were provided with food and psychological counselling in a local school.

Officials discounted terrorism as a cause of the blaze.

The country is on high alert amid threats from terrorist organisations to cause mayhem linked to the Winter Olympics in Sochi, which open on Friday.

'A team of detectives and operatives are working at the incident site,' said a spokesman.

A total of 57 wagons on the train were cordoned off today as emergency workers fought for many hours to extinguish the flames.

Thirteen long-distance passenger trains were delayed over the incident, disrupting traffic on the Trans-Siberian railway.
