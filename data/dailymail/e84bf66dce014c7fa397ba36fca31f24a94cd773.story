With only six months left on the Late Night show, Jimmy Fallon is pulling out all the stops.

And his latest stint will make you laugh you’re a** off, quite literally.

The 13-minute parody of the award-winning TV series, Breaking Bad, features plenty of cameos, including some of the actual stars from the television crime drama, such as Bryan Cranston, Bob Odenkirk and Aaron Michael Paul.

Joking Bad: Jimmy Fallon dons a bald head and glasses for the parody of Breaking Bad, looking very much like Bryan Cranston's character in the series, Walter White

'Bad' star: Aaron Michael Paul, who plays Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad, makes a cameo appearance

Surprise: Actor Bryan Cranston, who plays Walter White on Breaking Bad, appears as an audience member on the parody

The funny clip stars Fallon as himself trying to sell his jokes on the black market for cash and along the way he meets plenty of recognisable, and unexpected, faces, including some of his own colleagues from the Late Night with Jimmy Fallon show.

His head writer, Anthony David Miles, plays himself and Steve Higgins, the announcer for the Late Night show plays a ‘joke’ dealer.

Colin Quinn, the American stand-up comedian who was a cast member on Saturday Night Live for five years, also makes an appearance as himself.

Hip hop band, The Roots, who are the show’s in-house band, also have a cameo in which they are smoking 'incense'.

And finally, Jay Leno makes an appearance at the end of the skit, apparently wanting to hire head writer Miles to ‘kill Jimmy Fallon’.

Fallon has been appointed to become the next host of NBC's The Tonight Show, where he will succeed the current host, Leno, at the conclusion of the 2014 Winter Olympics.

Leno has hosted the show since 1992, with a one-year break from 2009 to 2010, during which he hosted The Jay Leno Show.

Breaking Bad, which premiered the second half of its fifth and final season in August, has received widespread critical acclaim since it premiered in 2008 and has been praised by some critics as the greatest television drama of all time.
