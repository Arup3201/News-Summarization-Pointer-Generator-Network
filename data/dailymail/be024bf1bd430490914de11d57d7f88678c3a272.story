The U.S. could once again be hit by a similar terrorist attack to 9/11,Â  according to the country's Defense Secretary.

Pentagon chief Leon Panetta said citizens must remain 'vigilant' and that the threat of a repeat of an event like Sepember 11 was 'very real'.

He added that the terrorist threat had, since the capturing or killing of Al Qaeda's top leaders in recent months, now evolved - with Yemen currently posing the biggest threat.

His comments came during a visit to Ground Zero, where he walked through the National September 11 Memorial Park and Museum with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Speaking from the 10th floor of 7 World Trade Center, the first completed office tower at the site of the attacks, he said: 'The potential for that kind of attack remains very real.'

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has urged Americans to stop referring to the site of the September 11 attacks as 'Ground Zero' to help the nation move past a term linked with the World Trade Center's destruction.

New Yorkers started calling the World Trade Center site Ground Zero shortly after suicide hijackers destroyed the twin towers and killed nearly 3,000 people.

'We will never forget the devastation of the area that came to be known as ground zero. Never. But the time has come to call those 16 acres what they are: The World Trade Center and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum,' Bloomberg said in a speech on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan.

Ground Zero originated as a term to describe the site of a nuclear explosion and later was used to refer to the point of any dramatic or violent event.

For several years the site was also known as 'the pit' because reconstruction of a new World Trade Center was stalled, leaving a large hole in the ground.

But today it is an active construction site with two of four planned skyscrapers under construction and the memorial plaza set to open in time for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

Mr Panetta was given an early glimpse of the memorial during his trip.He was shown its 30-foot man made walls of water that hug the sides of one-acre reflecting pools, that lie where the Twin Towers once stood. The water is meant to signify falling tears.

And he also visited the Survivor Tree, a non-fruit bearing pear tree rescued from the site after the attacks, and took a peek inside the still being built entrance to the museum.

But a visit to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, was cancelled because of bad weather.

It meant he was unable to see the area where hijackers flew United Airlines Flight 93 into the ground, killing all 40 passengers and crew shortly after the coordinated terrorist attack began in New York.

The 9/11 attacks killed nearly 3,000 people, including 184 at the Pentagon.

The names of every person who died in the attacks, including those at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, are inscribed in bronze panels that edge the reflecting pools at the Twin Towers site.

Mr Panetta's spokesman, Doug Wilson, said the Pentagon chief wanted to visit Shanksville and New York to highlight the role the military has played over the past decade in preventing further attacks on the homeland.

Accompanying him on his trip yesterday were five service members - one each from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard.

The visit also recalled the most memorable event of Panetta's tenure as CIA director - the killing of Osama Bin Laden in May.

Mr Panetta, who was a private citizen on the day of the attacks but who happened to be on Capitol Hill at the time, will attend 9/11 memorial events at the Pentagon on Sunday.

Bloomberg noted that lower Manhattan has thrived in recent years since the fall of the twin towers, gaining 4,000 new school seats, 19 new hotels, $260million in new parks and more new residents in the past decade than Atlanta, Dallas, and Philadelphia combined.

The area now boasts its highest population since the 1920s, he said.

Speaking to community leaders at the Association for a Better New York breakfast, Bloomberg continued: 'New York has come roaring back faster than anyone thought possible,' Bloomberg said, adding, 'I believe the rebirth and revitalization of Lower Manhattan will be remembered as one of the greatest comeback stories in American history.

'And I believe it will stand as our greatest monument to those we lost on 9/11.'

When completed, the tallest tower at the reconstructed World Trade Centre site will soar to 1,776ft - making it the tallest tower in the U.S. upon completion.
