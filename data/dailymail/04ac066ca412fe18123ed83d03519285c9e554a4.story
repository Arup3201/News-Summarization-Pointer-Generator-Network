Iranian warships dispatched to the Atlantic Ocean will travel close to U.S. maritime borders for the first time in a bid to send 'a message' to the White House.

A destroyer and helicopter-carrying supply ship began their voyage last month from the
 southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas and are on a three-month mission.

The voyage is intended to counter the U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf, as the Islamic Republic continues to assert its power across the Middle East and beyond.

'Iran's military fleet is approaching the United States' maritime borders, and this move has a message,'  Admiral Afshin Rezayee Haddad of Iran's Northern Navy Fleet said, according to The Jerusalem Post.

'This move has a message': Iranian warships dispatched to the Atlantic Ocean last month will travel close to U.S. maritime borders for the first time in response to U.S. fleets near Iran

Haddad said the vessels have already 
entered the Atlantic Ocean via waters near South Africa, carrying about 30 navy academy cadets for training along with their regular crews.

Iran had first warned America of its 
plans to deploy its naval forces along U.S. marine borders 'in the next 
few years' in September 2012.

Iran's Navy Commander Rear Admiral 
Habibollah Sayyari at the time said that the move would be a response to U.S. naval deployments near its own coastlines. 

The U.S. Navy’s 5th fleet is based in Bahrain, just across the Persian Gulf.

The news comes as Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said America had a 'controlling and meddlesome' attitude towards the Islamic Republic and would overthrow the Iranian government if it could.

'American officials publicly say they do not seek regime change in Iran. That's a lie. They wouldn't hesitate a moment if they could do it,' he said, in a speech to mark the 35th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution today.

'The solution to our economic problems is not looking out and having the sanctions lifted ... My advice to our officials, as ever, is to rely on infinite indigenous potentials.

'Our (hostile) stance toward the United States is due to its controlling and meddlesome attitude.'

Last month, Iran and six world powers agreed on how to implement a nuclear deal struck in November. It also signaled an easing of the financial sanctions crippling Iran's economy.
