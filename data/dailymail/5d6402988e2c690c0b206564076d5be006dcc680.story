Firefighters in Washington used a tiny respirator that helped them save the lives of a hamster family after a small house fire Friday.

The Lacey Fire Department took photos of rescuers in action and posted them to Twitter, causing the Internet to swoon.

WCVB reports that firefighters were called to a mobile home in Lacey, where a small fire had broken out.

Rescue: A Lacey firefighter administered oxygen through a small tube to a hamster that suffered smoke inhalation during a small house fire

The firefighters extinguished the flames, but inside the home five hamsters were in need of emergency care from smoke inhalation.

So the emergency responders thought on their feet, using a tiny respirator to administer oxygen to the hamster family.

The two adults, Oreo and Madonna, and two of the babies made it out safely. A third baby died as a result of the fire.

KTLA reports the hamster cage was next to a marriage certificate for Oreo and Madonna, drawn up in crayon. 

The most popular photo tweeted out showed a firefighter cradling one of the babies, trying to get it to breathe through the small opening of a piece of clear tubing. 

Reactions on Twitter called the firefighters heroes, with one users tweeting 'what is your address so i can send you gifts of love for saving a family of hamsters.' 

Emergency: Smoke poured from a mobile home after a dryer caught fire in the laundry room that affected the hamsters in the living room

First aid: After the fire was out, the department tweeted 'Family of hamsters rescued and receiving care from our fire fighters'

Prepared: A guide for treating pets affected by fire or in need of first aid came in handy to the firefighters responding to the mobile home fire

The department tweeted a photo of the sizable guide that firefighters use to administer care when animals are rescued. 

The fire was apparently started by a dryer in the laundry room. The hamster family was in a cage in the living room.

The department tweeted an advisory for families not to run dryers while they are out or asleep.
