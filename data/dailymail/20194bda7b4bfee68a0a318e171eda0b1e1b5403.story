You might never read an intellectual article in the likes of Nuts, FHM or Loaded; but this is not France, and over there they do things differently.

A Seventies French magazine which juxtaposed intellectual writing with soft porn pictures of famous women is set to be revived this autumn to fulfil the country's yearning for a more carefree age.

Icons ranging from Brigitte Bardot to Jane Fonda stripped for Lui magazine in its heyday, with their pictures interspersed with articles from the biggest names in French literature.

The magazine was published regularly for 25 years until it ceased at number 285 following a long, slow decline in the Eighties.

Now the publication, whose title 
translates as 'Him' in English, is to be brought back from the dead with
 French author and critic Frédéric Beigberger filling the editor's 
chair.

And just like in the
 magazine's golden era, he promises to revive the once successful recipe
 of scantily clad women and highbrow writing. 

Mr Beigberger told the Times that when he was asked to edit the reestablished title.

'Lui
 was my political and sexual education,' he said. 'It will be a 
hedonistic anti-crisis magazine. It is a gesture of disobedience to 
bring out a funny periodical in a morose climate.'

A fine vintage: New editor Frédéric Beigberger promises that, like the original Lui, the revived magazine will be 'a hedonistic anti-crisis magazine' aimed as a 'gesture of disobedience' in a morose economic climate

The new editor promises that the first issue, due to hit French newsstands on September 5, will have 200 pages of the 'light, carefree and sassy tone' of the original Lui 'before the oil shock' with a 'French spirit'.

'Like Lui of the original era, it will be full of great names of writers, journalists and photographers,' he told French news agency AFP, but without revealing which ones.

But he admits there may be difficulty in convincing today's leading stars to strip off.

Asked
 who will be the new Sylvia Kristel, Catherine Deneuve, Ursula Andress, 
Nastassja Kinski and Isabelle Huppert who, among hundreds of others, 
posed for the original Lui, he responded, with a glint of mischief: 
'Hard to say, why not politicians?'

Lui
 was first published in November 1963 by fashion photographer turned 
publisher Daniel Filipacchi with the objective of bringing some charm 'à
 la française' to the men's magazine market following the success of 
Playboy in the U.S.

With the
 motto of 'the magazine of the modern man', its successful recipe was to
 combine in-depth articles with beautiful naked women and, such was its 
success, it was able to attract often prominent French actresses to pose
 in its pages.

The magazine was successful from its origins until the early-Eighties when it fell into decline, finally ceasing publication in 1987. After a failed attempt at a relaunch, it passed into the hands of French media mogul Michel Birnbaum and became a pornographic magazine with only quarterly publication.

Mr Le Fur bought out the title from Birnbaums 1633 media group six months ago. The businessman, who successfully launched two magazines in the Nineties.

He told AFP that ten weeks prior to the relaunch, advertisers were already enthusiastic and ad-space order books had already been filled.

'The first issue will be printed in 350,000 copies and the sales target term is between 150,000 and 200,000 copies,' he added.
