America's biggest boasters are on the West Coast.

Residents of California and Washington came in as the top self-promoters on social media, according to a recent survey.

On the other end of the spectrum, Utah and Oregon came in as the most humble of all the states.

Self promotion: Residents of California and Washington came in as the top self-promoters on social media, according to a recent survey

A poll conducted by urban exploring app Hey Lets asked 2,500 respondents how many social media posts they made about typically 'self-promotional' topics, such as special events or exotic travel.

They found that for Californians, a whopping 77 percent of their social media output was potentially self promotional, with 76 percent for Washingtonians.

In Utah it was only 22 percent and in Oregon only 26 percent.

All that social media hype might actually be anti-social, according to a study published in Psychological Science in October.

In a paper titled The Unforeseen Costs of Extraordinary Experience, researchers described finding that a person's singular experience brings little pleasure to those hearing about it second hand.

A person who, say, had an incredible vacation or enjoyed the opportunity to test drive a luxury car enjoyed increased nonsocial pleasure.

Study: A study in Psychological Science found people took nonsocial pleasure in extraordinary experiences but did not enjoy trying to talk about that experience with others

But afterwards, the person felt he or she did not derive any social pleasure from talking to peers about the experience and instead came out feeling worse than if they simply had an everyday experience.

'It’s a timely question, given how much people are sharing and bragging about their experiences through social media,' Cassie Mogilner, an assistant professor of marketing at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, told the New York Times.

'This suggests that people may be rolling their eyes at all those posts about amazing vacations.'

Drawing from a pool of 68 participants, the study's authors broke subjects up into groups of four, showing three people a video other groups had rated two stars, while one lucky person watched a video rated four stars.

When the groups came together to discuss their experience, the one who had experienced the extraordinary movie enjoyed the socializing less.

'Our subjects thought they would be the star of the interaction, and they were surprised they were left out of it,' said co-author Daniel T. Gilbert, a Harvard social psychologist. 

'They didn’t understand why everyone else wanted to commiserate” about the bad movie “rather than hear about their great one.'

As for what got promoted most in social media updates, Hey Lets found survey subjects talked most about trips they had taken, followed by unique events attended and encounters with celebrities.
