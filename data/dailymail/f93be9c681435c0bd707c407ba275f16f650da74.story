An army veteran and his daughter are finally back together 21 years after his German wife had sent her to a foster home while he was in Iraq.

Kimberly Miller, 22, is now with father Robert and his new wife Karyn at their home in Guffey, Colorado.

The pair met for the first time in over two decades in July but it was not until October that Kimberley could secure a visa to live in America.

Gulf war: Robert Miller (not pictured) was activated for Desert Storm and while he was gone his wife left him and sent their daughter to live with foster parents

Robert, 48, now a correctional officer, had been stationed in Germany during the first Gulf War, when he had Kimberly, before he was activated for Desert Storm in Iraq.

But when he returned his wife had moved away and Kimberly had been given to foster carers.

In 1999 Robert was moved back to the United States - but he did not stop searching for his daughter even though the only thing he had to remember her by was an old photo.

Kimberly was taken back by her mother but then given up three more times to foster parents over the years.

'When I came back to Germany she was gone,' Robert told the Canon City Daily Record.

'I didn't know where she was,' he said. '(Kimberly's) mother just (disappeared). She wouldn't talk to me - they said I'm an American soldier, she's German - so I had no rights.'

He continued: 'I would write (my former wife) and I would never hear anything - nothing,' he said.

'But my (current) wife, Karyn, wrote her and she started answering back. I don't know why she would talk to her and not me.'

Robert and Karyn tried to get Kimberly to visit them when she was 13 but her mother refused to let the girl come without her.

The call was suddenly ended and communication between them was blocked off again.

But Kimberly was still searching, knowing her father lived in Colorado and earlier this year her maternal aunt and uncle helped her find details of a Robert Miller in Guffey.

She left a message at Rita's Cafe in the spring where Robert picks up an iced coffee on the way to work at the Canon Minimum Centers.

'A girl named Valerie was working there,' said Robert. 'I went in and she said "someone from Germany called here".'

But Valerie lost the note and it was not until a week later that the cafe owner Rita found it.

'A few days later I went by and she had the piece of paper,' explained Robert. 'It said "daughter looking for you" - and then the phone number.'

He continued: 'I did the easy thing and asked Karyn to call. But she told me I had to call.'

Eventually he picked up the phone and spoke to his daughter. 'I couldn't believe I was talking to her,' he said.

They began speaking via email and eventually she flew out to Denver International Airport to meet him and Karyn on July 13.

'Unbelievable,' said Robert. 'Twenty-one years later, I didn't think it was possible.'

He is delighted with the young woman that she has become over the past two decades.

'Very proud - very,' he said. 'She makes a father happy.

Robert continued: 'Sometimes I look at her and I think she's a little 12- or 14-year-old kid. Other times she's a grown woman.'

Kimberly said: 'I'm happy to stay here and I will come back as fast as I can.

'It is a good feeling to know where I came from. My dad and Karyn are nice people and I love them very much. I'm happy to see them again.'

She spent a week in the States before flying back home, determined toÂ  live in America permanently.

Robert and Karyn hired a lawyer to help them secure dual-citizenship and after a visa struggle they eventually sorted out the paperwork.

'It makes me angry that we tried everything to come here and nobody helps you,' Kimberly told the Denver Post. 'They said "there's nothing we can do - it's your problem, not ours." But finally, I'm here.'

She bought a one-way ticket to the United States and arrived on October 7.

In the weeks since then she has spent time on the Miller ranch, assisting with work on cars, splitting wood, driving a tractor and even firing Robert's guns.

Kimberly is not planning on staying at the ranch - she is currently looking for a job and house in Colorado Springs.

'The main thing is I have a job and earn some money to start,' she explained. 'We will see.'
