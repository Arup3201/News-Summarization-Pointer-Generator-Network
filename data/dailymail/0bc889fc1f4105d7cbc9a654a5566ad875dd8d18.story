Wojciech Szczesny insists Arsenal must forget last season's Barclays Premier League collapse as they look to win their first title since 2004.

The Gunners were top of the table for 128 days last term, but a loss of form towards the end of the season saw them finish fourth.

However, their poor finish was tempered by May's FA Cup win, their first trophy since 2005.

And the £30million arrival of Alexis Sanchez has raised hope that Arsenal are finally ready to launch a sustained title assault.

Szczesny agrees, but insists the club should not look back at how their championship challenge fell away last season.

'The time is over to reflect on last season's Premier League but we know we are strong enough to go and challenge again,' said Szczesny. 

'We went 100 odd days at the top of the league and we believe we can finish top.

'The fact we were top for so long gives us belief, it shows we are good enough to do it. If we can just find that little bit of consistency towards the end of the season hopefully we can finish top.

'We've not lost any of our players, apart from [Bacary] Sagna, but we signed [Mathieu] Debuchy who is a very good right-back. 

'We have signed Alexis Sanchez who is a massive player for us and I believe he is going to make a massive impact on the team. 

'I think we are stronger and more experienced as well. We managed to win that first trophy so the pressure is off and mentally we will be more prepared as well.'

Opportunity: Mathieu Flamini says Arsenal can't waste their best chance to win the league title

Mathieu Flamini has echoed Szczesny and urged Arsenal not to waste their 'best chance ever' to win the Barclays Premier League.

The Gunners will be among the early season favourites to lift the trophy next year following the arrival of Sanchez.

Arsene Wenger's side fly to Austria on Monday for an intense four-day training camp before the Emirates Cup kicks off on Saturday.

And midfielder Flamini reckons the Gunners are now well-placed to land their first title since 2004.

'I think now with the squad we have we have a good chance of winning the title, said the Frenchman. 

'It could be our best ever chance. The club have shown great ambition with the signings so far and everyone is excited.

'We are stronger now and if we can cut out the mistakes we can do it. I am talking about learning from our experience. 

'Perhaps some times last year we lost games too quickly. We have to learn from that.'

Bad start: Arsenal were in America to play a friendly against New York Red Bulls which they lost 1-0 to a Bradley Wright-Phillips goal
