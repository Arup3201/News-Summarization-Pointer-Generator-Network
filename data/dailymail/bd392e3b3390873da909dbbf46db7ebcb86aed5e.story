Danny Welbeck may have scored the goal that put his former club out of the FA Cup, but he was not the only former Old Trafford star who was on target on Monday night.

On an evening where Manchester United lacked creativity and firepower, three players they have let go in recent years scored around Europe to win their side crucial matches.

To add to Arsenal striker Welbeck's triumphant Old Trafford return, on loan winger Nani - deemed surplus to requirements by Louis van Gaal - and French midfielder Paul Pogba scored for their clubs.

Pogba, who was allowed to leave United by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012 after failing to sign a contract with the club, scored a stunning volley from the edge of the box to give Juventus a 1-0 win over Sassuolo.

The 82nd-minute goal put the 'Old Lady' 11 points clear at the top of Serie A, and keeps them on course for a fourth straight title.

In Portugal it was Nani - still technically a United player - who popped up for the winning goal for Sporting Lisbon in their 3-2 win over Panafiel.

Van Gaal has reportedly not spoken to the Portuguese winger since he was allowed to leave Old Trafford, but Nani showed he still has the quality to make the difference when it matters.

Down to ten men, Sporting had let a two-goal lead slip before Nani arrived to score a diving header and secure all three points against the Portuguese league's bottom side.

The win keeps Nani's side in the hunt to qualify for next season's Champions League, something Van Gaal's United look increasingly unlikely to do.

But none of those will hurt as much as Danny Welbeck's strike on Monday night, which was not only another winner from an ex-United player, but also against his former club.

Unlike the Frenchman Pogba or the Portuguese Nani, Welbeck is a product of United's academy. 

But after Van Gaal deemed him not good enough for Old Trafford - preferring expensive flop Radamel Falcao to warm the subs bench - the 24-year-old proved he can still score at the Theatre of Dreams.

On Monday, United could have done with the composure, bravery and quality shown by Welbeck, Nani and Pogba - but all three had been allowed  to leave.
