An 18-year-old woman was recommended for exclusion by her college 'for bringing it into disrepute' after accusing three fellow students of rape and sexual assault, a court has heard.

Three men have gone on trial at Hull 
Crown Court accused of abusing the woman on campus at Bishop Burton 
College in East Yorkshire.

The alleged victim said the men took 
her by surprise, snatching her telephone and door key, before leading her 
back to her room in a hall of residence and engaging in group sex at 
4am.

Accused (l to r): Thomas Price, 21, from Rotherham, is 
accused of rape and assault by penetration; Stephen Johnson, 21, from 
Hull, is accused of sexual assault and assault by penetration; and 
William Robinson, 20, of Doncaster, is accused of assault by 
penetration. All pictured outside Hull Crown Court today

'One got my 
telephone and the other got my keys. One said: "Do you want a 
fivesome?" I said: No! Go away! I was pushed into my room and on to my 
bed. One of them went through my drawers getting all my stuff out,' she told Hull Crown Court.

Thomas Price, 21, from Rotherham, is 
accused of rape and assault by penetration; Stephen Johnson, 21, from 
Hull, is accused of sexual assault and assault by penetration; and 
William Robinson, 20, of Doncaster, is accused of assault by 
penetration.

The court was told a fourth man in the group had left the room before the alleged assault took place.

The female student said one of the three men pulled off 
her jogging pants. 'I told them to get off. My next-door neighbour heard
me say: "Get off! Get out of my room!"' the court heard.

The woman said she faced exclusion from the college after reporting the men to staff, and was then forced to explain the situation to her parents, the court heard.

The woman told the jury her parents persuaded her to report it to the police after she received a letter from the college recommending she be excluded.

She told the court: 'I told the college I had been sexually assaulted but I didn't give the details of what had happened, I just gave them an outline.

'The college said I had brought it into disrepute by having sexual actions with a group of people.

The alleged assaults are said to have happened in a hall of residence on the campus at Bishop Burton College (above), East Yorkshire

'A couple of days later, they recommended that I was excluded.

'I was upset about it and my mum persuaded me to go to the police.'

The court heard a senior member of staff at the college interviewed the alleged victim and sent her a letter which read: 'I'm writing to confirm you have received a recommendation for exclusion from the college for bringing the college into disrepute by demeaning sexual actions with a group of people.'

The offences are alleged to have taken place last September.

The woman told the jury all three men befriended her outside the college, took her keys and pushed her into her room, where they sexually assaulted her.

She then claims they left laughing. The three men claim she consented to what happened, the court heard.

Prosecutor John Thackray said: 'The Crown say these three defendants, in drink, took advantage of her and took advantage of her knowing it was without consent.

'The prosecution say it was obvious to all three defendants that she was not consenting at any time.

'The complainant [later] reported the matter to the police.'

Her friend reported what had happened to the college - which covers further and higher education for those aged over 16 - and an investigation was launched.

She was asked to name the men by the college and told the jury she searched Facebook to identify her alleged attackers.

Mr Price's barrister Paul Genney suggested to her: 'You went perfectly willingly with those men and everything that happened with them was done with consent.

'I suggest you were angry with them for walking off and laughing and you were upset and hurt.

'You got a crime number from the police so it would back up your appeal to the college.'

The jury was shown CCTV footage of the men approaching the alleged victim as she smoked outside the college that night.

The woman alleges they pushed her into her room but the defence suggests she was smiling and going with the men willingly.

The defendants deny the charges.

The trial continues.
