A man who stabbed his girlfriend to death with a kitchen knife after she allegedly told him 'I want you to do it' has been found not guilty of murder.

Friends and family of Amy Aiton shook their heads and wept as Michael John Aller, 48, was found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter on Tuesday. 

A man yelled out 'you got away with murder, you grub', as Mr Aller was led away after the ruling.

Amy Aiton was brutally stabbed  by her partner Michael John Aller in 2012. The court heard Ms Aiton dared Mr Aller to kill her.

The Supreme Court found Aller was suffering from an abnormality of the mind when he carried out the 'ferocious' attack.

The court head Mr Aller had 'smashed' six cans of bourbon and Coke and several schooners of beer prior to the fatal altercation with Ms Aiton at their Narara property on July 31, 2012.

During the fight, he alleged Ms Aiton noticed him looking over at a knife.

"I glanced at it and she saw me glance at it and she said, `Go on ... I want you to do it. You either do it or I'm going to ... do it to you'," he claimed.

Mr Aller said he 'snapped...and repeatedly stabbed Amy.' 

After brutally stabbing Ms Aiton repeatedly with a kitchen knife, Mr Aller changed into clean clothes and headed to Sydney for a night of drinking at a hotel.

Mr Aller had a violent past and history with alcohol abuse, and was hospitalised twice before he killed Ms Aiton in 2012.

He turned himself in to police the next morning, and said the duo had an argument that spiralled 'way out of control'. 

The court also heard Mr Aller had a history of violence and alcohol abuse, and was admitted to hospital on two separate occasions in 2008 and 2011. 

In 2008, he allegedly threw a brick through his ex-wife's house, and in 2011 he said he had been 'betrayed' by a woman who had an AVO out against him. 

Mr Aller spent almost nine months in a rehabilitation centre from October 2011 to June 2012, during which time he admitted to thinking about harming his partner and his wife while drunk.

It was shortly after leaving rehabilitation that he met Ms Aiton, who had developed a marijuana addiction to cope with injuries suffered in a car accident.

Justice Peter Hidden said there was nothing to suggest Mr Aller was capable of the sort of extreme violence shown when killing Ms Aiton. 

Judge Hidden agreed with the recommendation of forensic psychiatrist Dr Richard Furst that it was highly likely Mr Aller had a serious mental illness prior to the offence, despite some doubts remaining over claims he was 'hearing voices' at the time of the killing.

Mr Aller will be sentenced at a later date.
