Former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. resigned  in November following a multi-month medical leave to treat his bipolar disorder and remains at the center of a federal investigation into alleged misuse of campaign funds.

Now his wife Sandi Jackson, who held a local government position in their hometown of Chicago, is also the focus of her own federal investigation.

Mrs Jackson had always been a key focus of the investigation into her husbands funds- which were reportedly used to help furnish their homes in both Washington D.C. and Chicago as well as Mr Jackson's purchase of a $40,000 Rolex for a female friend.

Partners: Jesse Jackson Jr is long-thought to be under federal investigation, but today it was revealed that his wife Sandi (left) is also the subject of her own investigation into misuse of his campaign funds

But now, the Chicago Sun Times reports that she is under her own degree of scrutiny as there is now an independent investigation into Sandi Jackson.

According to news reports citing unnamed sources, Jesse Jackson Jr. was also being investigated by the FBI over possible misuse of campaign money and a Wall Street Journal report said the investigation had expanded to include Sandi Jackson.

Today's report is the first to explicitly state that investigators have opened a separate case on she alone.

Between 2001 and 2012, Sandi Jackson's consulting firm, J. Donatella & Associates, received about $472,000 from her husband's campaign.

The biggest payments came in the 2011-12 campaign finance cycle, at $120,000 as of October 31, and the 2009-10 cycle, at $116,000, according to the website OpenSecrets.org, which compiles campaign financial data.

The Federal Election Commission has declared the practice of lawmakers employing relatives as legal for campaign committees.

Resigned: Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., seen in March, announced his registration in late November- after being re-elected to office- citing his health problems. Sandi, seen left, resigned from her local government post three weeks ago

Sandi Jackson's campaign, Friends of Sandi Jackson, received $242,012 from her husband's campaign, according to OpenSecrets.

This news comes nearly three weeks after Mrs Jackson resigned from her position as an alderman- an member of the Chicago City Council- citing 'very painful family health issues'.

In her letter of resignation, Sandi Jackson said she decided that her constituents and colleagues 'deserve a partner who can commit all of their energies to the business of the people.'

She has been splitting her time between Washington, D.C., where the family has a residence, and her Chicago home, according to reports.

Re-elected: Jackson Jr. easily won re-election this month despite his only contact with voters having been a robocall since he was being treated for bipolar disorder out-of-state

High emotions: Jackson, Jr, seen embracing his father the Reverend Jesse Jackson at the 2000 Democratic National Convention, was described as too emotional to complete a public appearance announcing his resignation announcing

She has faced criticism from some constituents about her absences from council business, according to local media reports.

'It's not easy being an alderman, especially when you have the problem with your husband,' said Paul Green, a political science professor at Chicago's Roosevelt University.

'The long knives have been sharpened for her. This had to be a tremendous mental pressure on her and that should relieve her of some of that.'

Sandi Jackson was elected to her alderman seat on Chicago's South Side in February 2007.
