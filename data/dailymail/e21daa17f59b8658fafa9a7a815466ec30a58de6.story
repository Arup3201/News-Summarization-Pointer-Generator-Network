A prominent Pennsylvania family's luxurious suburban lifestyle has been financed by more than $20 million in fraudulent insurance claims amid a series of mansion fires and repeated reports of jewelry theft, authorities said on Thursday.

An investigation began after a 2013 fire at the stately home Claire Risoldi - a prominent Republican donor and fund-raiser- shared with relatives in Doylestown, an hour's drive north of Philadelphia. 

It was the third blaze in five years at the property, which she dubbed Clairemont, authorities said.

Fraud: Claire Risoldi has been charged with conspiracy, witness intimidation and forgery, with authorities claiming she filed fraudulent insurance claims to fund her luxurious lifestyle

Blaze: The Risoldi family mansion in Buckingham, Pennsylvania, has caught fire three times in five years

Scene: Seen here is the most recent fire at the Pennsylvania property, which is known as Clairemont

Probe: Officials said the investigation began in October 2013 after a fire at a home in New Hope, Bucks County

Risoldi had falsely accused volunteer firefighters of stealing 55 pieces of jewelry worth more than $10 million while battling the flames, according to a grand jury presentment.  

The family's jewelry collection had included two items valued at $106,000 only four months earlier, officials said.

Charge: Thomas J. French, 64, the husband of Claire Risoldi and a retired deputy sheriff, was also involved

Authorities said the ensuing probe uncovered a decades-long pattern of questionable insurance claims by Risoldi. 

She still possessed jewelry she reported stolen in 1993, according to investigators. 

She had reported another jewelry theft from a different home in 1984 and a house fire in 1977.

As a result of the investigation, authorities seized about $7 million in family assets, including $3 million in bank accounts, $1.2 million in jewelry, six Ferraris and two Rolls-Royces.

The state attorney general's office charged Risoldi, 67, with counts including conspiracy, attempted theft by deception, witness intimidation and forgery. 

Six other people, including her husband, two children and daughter-in-law, also face charges.

Also charged was Risoldi's son, Carl A. Risoldi, 43, and his wife, Sheila M. Risoldi, 43, both of Buckingham; Claire Risoldi's husband, Thomas J. French, 64, also of Buckingham; private investigator Mark Goldman, 54, of Wayne, and fabric vendor Richard Holston, 51, of Medford Lakes, N.J.

Risoldi, who is free after posting bail, isn't living at the Doylestown home and couldn't be located for comment Thursday.  

Family ties: Risoldi's son, Carl A. Risoldi, 43, a public relations and marketing specialist, and his wife, Sheila M. Risoldi, have been charged with multiple offenses, including theft by deception

Involved: Carla Risoldi, a former Bucks County prosecutor and now a private attorney, and private investigator Mark Goldman, 54, were also charged on multiple counts

Her daughter's lawyer had no comment.

Officials haven't determined the causes of the Doylestown fires, but they said large amounts of highly flammable material had been placed near the origin of each blaze. 

Video from the home's security system in 2013 showed Risoldi leaving a minute before smoke was visible outside the house, authorities said.

An insurance company has paid out more than $20 million for the three fires but is fighting the most recent jewelry claim. 

Physical evidence 'proved that the jewelry could not have possibly been stolen in the manner described by the Risoldis,' the grand jury presentment said.

'This family and their co-conspirators stole millions to fund a lifestyle of extravagance and excess,' Attorney General Kathleen Kane told The Philadelphia Inquirer.

'Insurance fraud drives up the cost for everyone, including seniors and middle-class families. 

'Even worse, the scheme was facilitated through threats, intimidation and falsely accusing first responders of serious crimes.'

The newspaper also reported that Risoldi has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the county's Republican Party, state lawmakers and a county judge.

She also has organized political fund-raisers for local candidates, that were held at her New Hope mansion.
