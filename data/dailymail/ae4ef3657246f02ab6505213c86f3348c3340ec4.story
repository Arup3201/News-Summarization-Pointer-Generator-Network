Hundreds of people who bought Olympics tickets through Thomas Cook have been told they will have to come to London to collect the tickets after they failed to arrive in the post.

The troubled retailer- which has been criticised for selling ‘overpriced’ Olympics packages - has told the worried customers that they will now have to queue up to collect their tickets, in some cases just hours before the event.

Some families will be forced to come to London a day early as a result of the problems while others said they feared missing their event because they were stuck in a queue for tickets.

Fiasco: Hundreds of people who bought Olympics tickets through Thomas Cook have been told they will have to come to London to collect the tickets after they failed to arrive in the post

Aaron and Danielle Highley, who booked
tickets and a hotel through Thomas Cook, were horrified to find out 
they would have to queue for their tickets in central London on the day 
of their event after their tickets failed to arrive.

Mr
Highley, 28, said feared they would miss the event anyway if they had 
to queue for tickets in west London just an hour and a half before it 
started.

‘I was told that their office would open at 8.00am,’ he said.

‘But the handball event starts many miles away - and a transport nightmare away - at 9.30am.

‘So
we would have to travel into the centre of London, join a very long 
queue then have absolutely no chance of making it to the Olympic Park 
for the event we have paid to attend.’

Mr Highley, from Woodbury in Devon, paid £250 for the break and tickets for him and buyer wife Danielle, 26.

‘We just wanted to experience the once-in-a-lifetime event,’ he said.

London a day early as a result of the problems while others said they 
feared missing their event because they were stuck in a queue for 
tickets

‘We
booked a hotel outside the congestion zone to save money and we are due
to see a handball event in the Olympic Park which we are excited about 
visiting.’

But
when the tickets failed to arrive as promised, Mr Highley, an online 
retailer, contacted Thomas Cook to find out what was going on.

‘I spent more than an hour holding on an expensive phone line before anyone at Thomas Cook answered the phone,’ he said.

‘In his words he said “yes sir, there has been a major cock up”. He told me it was chaos.’

Mr
Highley was told that he and his wife would have to make their way to 
Marble Arch in West London along with thousands of others over the 
weekend to pick up their tickets.

He was warned that he would have to be at the office very early on Sunday morning as they were expecting long queues.

But Mr Highley said the queues could be so long that by the time they get to the venue and got through security, they could miss the event anyway.

But when he asked about a refund, the Thomas Cook worker said that they would only refund the £5 cost of the courier who didn’t arrive as a ‘goodwill gesture.’

Last night dozens of other customers took to twitter to complain about the problems.

Richard Rolfe wrote: ‘Where are my Olympic Tickets. You don’t respond to email, you keep me on the phone an hour...how do I get through?’

Another customer wrote: ‘Despite the vast sums of money paid for my #olympic swim tickets @ThomasCookUK still not delivered them and can’t get through on phone. Poor’ before adding: ‘Been on hold to @ThomasCookUK 16 minutes listening to ‘wonderful world’.

Without my Olympics tickets it most 
certainly is not.’ Last night Thomas Cook said it would look at 
individual cases where people were left out of pocket by the problems.

A
spokeswoman said: ‘Thomas Cook can confirm that a small proportion of 
its London 2012 customers have experienced delays in receiving their 
Olympic tickets.

‘As a result, the company has contacted them to ensure tickets are able to collected in London.

‘Our priority is to ensure our customers take their seat at the Games.

The troubled holiday retailer still had almost a quarter of its 300,000 tickets for the Games to sell last month following worse than expected sales among its corporate customers

‘Unfortunately,
a very small proportion have experienced a delay and we’ve contacted 
them all to confirm collection of their tickets from a choice of 
locations in London.

We’d like to reiterate our apology for this unavoidable delay and naturally we’re also refunding any delivery charges already paid.’

They said tickets could be collected on arrival, or prior to the event, at locations in central London, Heathrow and near the Olympic Park.

The troubled holiday retailer still had almost a quarter of its 300,000 tickets for the Games to sell last month following worse than expected sales among its corporate customers.

The travel company, which is one of the official tour operators for London 2012, bought the tickets to sell to business clients as part of lavish packages.

But the deals - which were priced between £599 and £6,499 and included five-star restaurant meals and a stay in the Waldorf Hilton hotel in central London - failed to sell.
