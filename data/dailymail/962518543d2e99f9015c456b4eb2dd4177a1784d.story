Following Paul Lambert's sacking at Aston Villa, England's top flight finds itself without a Scottish manager for the first time since 1984 – almost unthinkable for a country that sent down Sir Matt Busby, Bill Shankly, Kenny Dalglish, George Graham and Sir Alex Ferguson to enrich the old First Division and Premier League.

Four years ago, Glaswegians Fergie, Dalglish, David Moyes, Alex McLeish, Owen Coyle and Steve Kean traded blows with each other in the Premier League. Paul Lambert was soon to join them, Malkay Mackay and Billy Davies were at the top of the Championship, with Mackay also leading Cardiff to a major cup final.

Scotland's reputation for producing the finest football managers in the world was at its peak and people studied what made them so successful. For such a rapid decline in their status is a huge blow to national pride north of the border.

Paul Lambert's sacking means there are no Scottish managers left in the English top flight 

Lambert's reign at Aston Villa was a testing time for the former Scotland and Celtic midfielder

Lambert's Aston Villa side managed just 12 goals in 25 Premier League games this season

McLeish, Coyle, Kean and Dalglish were sacked, Moyes followed later after swapping a big club for an even bigger one. Fergie retired and on Wednesday night the axe swung down on Lambert at Aston Villa, whose side have scored just 12 goals in 25 matches.

It leaves no Scottish presence in the hot seat since Don Mackay took over at Coventry City on December 28, 1984. The following summer Dalglish became the player-manager at Liverpool and blazed a trail for Graham, Ferguson and Moyes that has been uninterrupted before now.

While the English national team had to look abroad for managers because of a lack of domestic candidates, Scotland was spoilt for choice.

Sir Alex Ferguson is still the No 1 and his Treble of Champions League, FA Cup and Premier League in 1999 remains his greatest achievement during his time in charge of Manchester United

Ferguson chose David Moyes to succeed him at Old Trafford but it never worked out for him

Coyle, who managed Burnley and Bolton in the top flight and is now in charge of MLS franchise Houston Dynamo, spoke proudly of his roots growing up in the Gorbals area of Scotland's largest city.

'Growing up where we did in Glasgow, you are never handed anything. You have to go and earn and make sure along the way, you look after yourself,' he said.

'I remember my father, God rest him, saying to me, never ever be afraid of hard work. And he's right, if it doesn't go your way, you will accept that because you know you've given it your best shot.

Matt Busby's Manchester United were the first English club to win the European Cup - in 1968

Bill Shankly was no stranger to wining silverware and is pictured here with the FA Cup back in 1974

Scots have FIVE places in the list of the top 10 most successful managers in English league history

'There is a passion, a drive, ambition from everybody to be the best and push everybody on. Whether it is social skills in growing up with people, trying to get the best of others, I don't know.

'But what I do know is I know the other Glaswegian managers personally, they have a real fire in their belly to do their very best.'

But as the game moves on, the current generation of Scottish managers don't seem to have moved with it even though their coaching set-up at Largs is first-rate and used by everyone from Jose Mourinho downwards.

Rule changes in football have generally suited the attackers, leaving well-organised coaches like Moyes vulnerable at clubs like Manchester United where you are expected to win every week. Lambert was constantly criticised at Villa for being overly-negative and just trying to catch teams on the break.

Also, the passion that Scots have for football may not be replicated elsewhere. Men like Dalglish were seen as old-fashioned by certain people within their club as overseas bosses like Mourinho, Arsene Wenger and lately Ronald Koeman brought in new methods and often a different way of motivating players.

The highest-ranked Scottish manager now is Alex Neil at Norwich City, just outside the play-off places in the Championship. Maybe Villa should try to bring Fergie out of retirement.

TROPHY-WINNING SCOTS WHO FOLLOWED ON FROM BUSBY AND SHANKLY IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE ERA.. 

KENNY DALGLISH (LIVERPOOL AND BLACKBURN)

He won the League and FA Cup double with Liverpool in his first season as player-manager in 1985-86 and then built a new title-winning team around the likes of John Barnes and Peter Beardsley. Quit Liverpool in 1991 but later returned to win the Premier League with Blackburn and though a second spell at Anfield wasn't as successful, he still led them to the 2012 League Cup – the club's only trophy in nine years.

SIR ALEX FERGUSON (MANCHESTER UNITED) 

Won an unprecedented 49 trophies with Manchester United, including a record 13 Premier League titles and three European crowns (two Champions League and one European Cup-Winners' Cup). The son of a shipworker from Glasgow's Govan dockyards, he will go down as the greatest football manager of all-time, having turned Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney into superstars.

Fergie also led United, with Cristiano Ronaldo in their ranks, to Champions League glory in 2008

GEORGE GRAHAM (ARSENAL AND SPURS) 

Lifted Arsenal from the doldrums and twice made them league champions, most famously at Anfield in 1989 with a last-minute goal from Michael Thomas. He built his sides around a mean defence and homegrown youthful players like Tony Adams and Paul Merson. After a spell at Leeds – he was sacked by Arsenal for financial irregularities - he returned to the Gunners arch-enemies Tottenham and won a League Cup there.

GRAEME SOUNESS (LIVERPOOL) 

After starting his managerial career with Rangers, Souness returned to Anfield where he had starred as a player. Although his term lasted less than three years, and he subsequently admitted trying to change things at the club too quickly, Liverpool did win the 1992 FA Cup under his stewardship, Souness leading his team at Wembley against Sunderland against the advice of his doctors who had recently performed triple heart by-pass surgery. Liverpool won the final 2-0 in a game that made local boy Steve McManaman an overnight sensation

Graeme Souness, despite doctors telling him not to, led Liverpool to FA Cup glory in 1992

ALEX MCLEISH (BIRMINGHAM CITY)

McLeish, a former player under Ferguson at Aberdeen, led Birmingham to the biggest day in the club's history when they shocked Arsenal at Wembley to win the League Cup with a late goal from Obafemi Martins. He later went to Aston Villa but the fans never took to the former Bluenose.

Alex McLeish became a Birmingham hero after leading them to League Cup glory at Wembley in 2011

Honourable mentions for..FA Cup finalists Gordon Strachan and David Moyes and promotion winners Owen Coyle, Billy Davies and Paul Lambert.
