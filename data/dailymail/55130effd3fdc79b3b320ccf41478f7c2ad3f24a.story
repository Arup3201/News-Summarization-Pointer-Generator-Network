Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak has accepted an FA charge for violent conduct and has been banned for four matches after elbowing West Ham striker Diafra Sakho.

Jedinak had until 6pm on Tuesday night to appeal against the charge - a move which would have made him available to face Southampton - but he decided to accept it at the risk of a lengthier ban for a frivolous appeal.

As the 30-year-old Australian has already been sent off this season - against Sunderland - he has been given a four-match ban, the FA confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.

As well as missing the trip to Southampton on Tuesday night, Jedinak is banned for Palace's home match against QPR on March 14, an away fixture at Stoke on March 21 and Manchester City's visit to Selhurst Park on April 6.

The incident occured in the 87th-minute of Palace's 3-1 win at Upton Park on Saturday and was picked up by Sky Sports' TV cameras.

Manager Alan Pardew on Monday bemoaned the extra scrutiny added to games that are shown live on TV.

'The punditry seems to be having a greater effect on the decision process at the FA. That’s a little bit worrying,' he said. 'I hope you’re governed by the FA, not by what people are saying on the TV.

'We’re damned by TV at times. If something’s done about Mile but nothing about [Hull defender] Maynor Figueroa [whose challenge on Stephen Ireland left the Stoke midfielder with a nasty gash], that can’t be right.'

A Palace statement on Tuesday read: 'Crystal Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak has accepted the violent conduct charge from the Football Association handed to him yesterday (Monday).'

Shortly after an FA statement confirmed: 'Mile Jedinak will serve a four match suspension with immediate effect after he admitted an FA charge of violent conduct which was not seen by the match officials but caught on video.'
