A massive sex operation sting has led to the arrests of 40 men, including an Iraq war veteran, a teacher, and five university students.

Operation Spiderweb 2, which was organized by the Lee and Orange County Sheriffs Offices, targeted central Florida.

In the sting, deputies posed as minors online, soliciting the allegedly predatory men for underage sex in chat rooms.

In a video set up by police, a young woman posing as a young girl opens the door to an alleged predator

But as he steps through the door police waiting police swoop in on him as part of an organised sting

According to the Orlando Sentinel, 40
men were arrested in Orange County. More than 40 deputies had lured 
them into a secure location by placing online ads offering ‘fun’ for the
men.

The sting lasted one week, and led to the arrests of men like 29-year-old Aremio Solis, an Iraq War veteran.

Solis said in an interview that his tour in Iraq had left him haunted by ‘weird things.’

The
stepfather of a young girl believed he was speaking with a 13-year-old 
girl who described herself as ‘liberated and interested in learning 
more.’ In actuality, she was speaking with one of the Orange County 
Sheriff’s Deputies.

The
forty men, between ages 18-50, were arrested at a home in Lee county, 
and had traveled to the location believing that girls aged 11 to 15 
awaited them.

Several educators were among those 
arrested by authorities, including Isaiah Jones, who worked as a 
physical education teacher at Lehigh Senior High School.

In addition, North Nicholas High School teacher Chris Cheplevich was arrested, according to Fox4now.com.

Another man arrested worked as a pool boy.

Five students from Florida Gulf Coast University were also among those charged.

Though lasting only a week in execution, the sting took months of planning between multiple local and federal authorities.

The FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and several sheriffs’ offices were involved in the massive sting.

Several who arrived at the house were in possession of illegal narcotics, the sheriff’s office said, and faced additional charges.

Two were apparently illegal immigrants; their cases were forwarded to ICE.

Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott said in a statement: ‘Those trying to prey on our children are served notice today that we will not tolerate this illegal activity.

‘We cannot be idle in this task. Parents, I urge you to recognize the threat exists and be sure you have lines of communication open with your children and monitor their social networking activity.’
