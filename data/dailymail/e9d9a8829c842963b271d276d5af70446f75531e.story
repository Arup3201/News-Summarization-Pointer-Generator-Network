The CIA's acting director has sent out a scathing public deploration of film Zero Dark Thirty to his entire staff after watching what he calls entertaining historical inaccuracies in its portrayal of the raid of Osama bin Laden's compound.

Billed as 'the story of history's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man' by using firsthand accounts, the film recounts U.S. troops' top secret mission while highlighting the first hours of May 1st of 2011.

'I would not normally comment on a Hollywood film, but I think it's important to put Zero Dark Thirty which deals with one of the most significant achievements in our history, into some context,' Mike Morell began in his note to his staff on Friday.

Hollywood portrayal: Actress Jessica Chastain is seen in a scene from new film Zero Dark Thirty which has been most recently criticized by acting CIA director Mike Morell for historical inaccuracies

Not a fan: Acting CIA Director Michael Morell lambasted the film in a public statement to his employees on Friday claiming it doesn't fairly portray what really happened in 2011 or the decade of work beforehand

Mr Morell accuses the film as being overwhelmingly misleading in its timeline, depiction of CIA personnel and their actions, as well as its shown use of torture to generate information.

'What I want you to know is that Zero Dark Thirty is a dramatization, not a realistic portrayal of the facts,' he begins.

Among three points, Mr Morell argues the hunt for bin Laden having been a group effort of hundreds of officers over a decade, contrasting the Hollywood film attributing it to, as he writes, 'just a few individuals.'

In the film written by screenwriter Mark Boal, the mission’s leading intelligence operative is played by Jessica Chastain who is largely credited in the film for finding bin Laden’s secret compound in Abbottabad, Afghanistan.

'This may make for more compelling entertainment, but it does not reflect the facts,' he writes.

'Second,' he begins, 'the film creates the strong impression that the enhanced interrogation techniques that were part of our former detention and interrogation program were the key to finding Bin Ladin. That impression is false.'

He argues multiple sources outside of a primary use of 'enhanced interrogation' - the CIA's popular chosen description of torture - in finding bin Laden.

Hot and cold: The film, one scene pictured, has since been nominated for four Golden Globes despite mutually searing criticism from Washington

'Some came from detainees subjected to enhanced techniques, but there were many other sources as well,' he wrote.

'Third, the film takes considerable liberties in its depiction of CIA personnel and their actions, including some who died while serving our country. We cannot allow a Hollywood film to cloud our memory of them,' he concluded.

‘CIA interacted with the filmmakers through our Office of Public Affairs but, as is true with any entertainment project with which we interact, we do not control the final product.'

The film that’s currently playing in select theatres before its full release in January has been since nominated for four Golden Globe awards.

But critics arguing its factuality, like Mr Morell, have come from the nation’s top politicians as well.

Last week Senators Diane Feinstein, Carl Levin and John McCain wrote a letter to Sony Picture chairman and CEO Michael Lynthon accusing it as being 'factually inaccurate.'

The three asked for a disclaimer before 
the film on its accuracies, contrasting its current reading:  ‘based on 
firsthand accounts of actual events.’

Criticisms: Among Mr Morell's complaints of the film, pictured, are its depiction of torture used by U.S. troops to gain information and the mission's credit given to a select number of people

Like Mr Morell, they also target the film's shown use of torture.

'Zero Dark Thirty is factually inaccurate, and we believe that you have an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Usama Bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative,' they wrote.

Feinstein is chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the group who will oversee President Obama's selection of CIA director which Morell is considered a top candidate for.

Earlier this month the film's screenwriter Mark Boal defended his work to the New York Times, expressing the complexity in cramming such a timeline of events into a film of approximately two and a half hours.

'I’m trying to compress a program that lasted for years into a few short scenes,' he said, adding that it also aims 'to reflect a very complex debate about torture that is still going on.'

Mr Boal and director Kathryn Bigelow have previously defended it as a film not intended to withstand nit-picking historians.

Statement to Employees from Acting Director Michael Morell: "Zero Dark 
Thirty"

December 21, 2012

I would not normally comment on a Hollywood film, but I think it important to 
put Zero Dark Thirty, which deals with one of the most significant 
achievements in our history, into some context.  The film, which premiered this 
week, addresses the successful hunt for Usama Bin Ladin that was the focus of 
incredibly dedicated men and women across our Agency, Intelligence Community, 
and military partners for many years.  But in doing so, the film takes 
significant artistic license, while portraying itself as being historically 
accurate.

What I want you to know is that Zero Dark Thirty is a dramatization, 
not a realistic portrayal of the facts.  CIA interacted with the filmmakers 
through our Office of Public Affairs but, as is true with any entertainment 
project with which we interact, we do not control the final product.

It would not be practical for me to walk through all the fiction in the film, 
but let me highlight a few aspects that particularly underscore the extent to 
which the film departs from reality.

Commentators will have much to say about this film in the weeks ahead.  
Through it all, I want you to remember that Zero Dark Thirty is not a 
documentary.  What you should also remember is that the Bin Ladin operation was 
a landmark achievement by our country, by our military, by our Intelligence 
Community, and by our Agency.
