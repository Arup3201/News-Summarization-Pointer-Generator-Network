Unmasked: Undercover PC Mark Kennedy - also known as Mark 'Flash' Stone - was exposed during a £1million trial involving a lot to invade a power station in 2009

A group of ten women and one man are suing Scotland Yard alleging they were tricked into personal relationships with undercover officers such as Mark Kennedy causing emotional trauma.

The claims emerged as the Met attempted to have their case thrown out of the High Court and heard in a tribunal behind closed doors.

Lawyers representing the group claim the highly-secretive court could ‘smother’ the cases of those seeking damages.

The women claim specialist officers from the Covert Human Intelligence Source - CHIS - infiltrated environmental activist groups and had sex with them.

The man claims damages for a non-sexual incident.

The ‘secret justice’ row is the latest twist to the extraordinary saga following the outing of protester Mark Kennedy as an undercover Met police officer.

Kennedy, who was married with two children, was dramatically unmasked last year by an environmental protest group he had spied on for seven years.

Three women referred to in court had relationships with Kennedy who spent spent seven years living as a long-haired climber called Mark 'Flash' Stone.

One woman said she fell in love with Kennedy and believed him to be her ‘soul mate’ - before later finding out that he and a ‘whole team of secret people’ had been ‘digging away at her life.’

The scandal prompted a string of public and internal inquiries and a torrent of questions about how highly-sensitive undercover operations are run.

Two other women had sexual relationships with a colleague of Kennedy's who claimed he was a truck driver called Mark Jacobs.

Jacobs had taken part in 'deeply personal aspects of their lives', including attending the funeral of one woman's father, the court heard.

Legal battle: The Met police are attempting to have the case struck out from the High Court in London so it can be heard by a secretive tribunal instead

As a result of Kennedy’s  exposure, a £1m case against activists accused of planning to invade a power station collapsed - and several women came forward to say they had had affairs with him.

A string of other women later came forward to complain that they too had been ‘tricked’ into forming relationships with undercover officers.

The group is now suing the Met and the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) alleging negligence, misconduct and deceit at the High Court.

One woman bringing a case says an undercover officer fathered her son - now aged 27 - but later vanished from her life.

She claims the Met should pay for his upbringing. 

Compensation: The group of ten women and one man are suing the Met police claiming they were tricked into relationships with undercover officers and suffered emotional trauma

But police have lodged a counter-claim to have the case struck out of the High Court, arguing they should instead be considered by the secretive Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT).

The tribunal is the only judicial body with the power to investigate the security services and was set up to consider public complaints about unreasonable surveillance.

Those appearing before it have fewer rights than in an ordinary court as there is no obligation to take oral evidence and the vast majority of hearings are held behind closed doors.

It has upheld fewer than one in a 100 complaints since it was created in 2000 and complainants are allocated an advocate rather than choosing a lawyer.

The tribunal is not required to give reasons for its judgments and there is no automatic right of appeal.

The Met argues that because the operations were authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) the claims should not be heard in an ordinary court.

Lawyers for the police admitted the women may be entitled to damages if they have a 'legitimate grievance.'

Monica Carss-Frisk QC told
Mr. Justice Tugendhat: 'This case is not about denying remedy for any 
legitimate grievance. It is about the right forum for determining these 
claims.'

Eco spy: The trial of six activists after undercover officer Mark Kennedy changed sides and offered to help the defence.

2003 - 2010: As an undercover officer for the Metropolitan police, PC Mark Kennedy infiltrates anumber of activist groups including environmental and anti-racist movements. Using the name Mark 'Flash' Stone he claims to be a professional climber.

April 2009 - Police arrest 114 activists at a school near Nottingham in a bid to prevent them from breaking into Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station the next day. Of those, 26 were later charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass.

January 2010 - 20 activists were found guilty of the plot to invade the power station but were given lenient sentences.

October 2010 - Kennedy is confronted by some of the activists after they discover documents revealing his true identity. He admits to being a Met spy then disappears.

January 2011 - The case against the remaining six activists dramatically collapses days before a trial is due to start after Kennedy changes sides and offers to help the defence. The 20 who were convicted appeal their convictions because his identity as an eco spy had been kept secret from the jury.

November 2011 - During an interview with Channel 4, Kennedy claims to have been used by the police forces of 22 countries including Germany, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Spain and Italy.

December 2011 - Eight women started legal action against the Met alleging they suffered emotional trauma after being tricked into personal relationships with undercover officers.

March 2012 - Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Greany takes over as head of  the National Domestic Extremism Unit in the wake of the Kennedy scandal.

This week - Hearing begins to decide if the claim by ten women and one man that they were tricked into personal relationships with undercover officers can be heard in the High Court.

But critics said the move flies in the face of the basic principles of open justice and is yet another example of information being hidden from the public.

Green politician Jenny Jones, who sits on a committee that oversees the Met, believes important information is being withheld.

She said: ‘I’m very concerned about this because clearly the Met is trying to hide its dirty laundry.

‘These women deserve to have their stories told and for people to understand that what happened to them was a complete betrayal of trust.

‘There seems to be a trend of the State clearly trying to hide its secrets and that’s not acceptable.’

Lawyers from two firms representing the women will argue that sexual relationships with targets are not sanctioned under Ripa.

Harriet Wistrich, of Birnberg Peirce, said: ‘These women are suing for a gross invasion of privacy and the Met’s response is to try and hive it off into a secret court.’

Police say undercover officers were ‘never authorised’ to conduct sexual relationships, although a review has been set up to examine cases dating back to the 1980s.

But senior officers admit they cannot formally ban intimate contact because it would quickly become a ‘litmus test’ for people looking to identify police.

The women claim that the officers deliberately invaded their private lives to spy on them and that the resulting deceit has caused psychological damage.

One discovered only recently that her son was fathered by an undercover police officer, who then disappeared from their lives.

She is planning a legal claim that will discover whether police should bear some financial responsibility for the child’s upbringing.

A Met spokesman said: ‘They are very unusual and complex areas of law.

‘Our legal position is that the Investigatory Powers Tribunal is the proper authority to hear these cases because of the nature of them and the evidence involved but the decision on this will be made by a judge.’
