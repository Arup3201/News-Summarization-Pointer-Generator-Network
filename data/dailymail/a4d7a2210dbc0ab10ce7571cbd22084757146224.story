Apple's founder Steve Jobs wanted to wage a 'Holy War' against Google a year before he died, a top-secret email has revealed.

The tech visionary sent the email in 2010 to his top 100 most senior executives, in which he outlined the company's strategy for the following year.

About half-way down the email - headed by the words 'FYI - DO NOT FORWARD' - he suggests launching a 'Holy War with Google', bidding his underlings to suggest 'all the ways we will compete with them'.

'Holy War': The tech visionary sent the email in 2010 to his top 100 most senior executives, in which he outlined the company's strategy for the following year

Also in the email, Jobs heralded the 'end of the PC-era' and promised to 'further lock customers into our ecosystem, warning that Apple was 'in danger of hanging on to old paradigm too long.'

It also mentions the future of Apple TV, including a strategy to 'stay in the living room game and make a great 'must have' accessory for iOS devices,' with content from NBC, CBS, Viacom and HBO, as well as a possible TV-subscription service.

He wrote the email at a time when Apple's fears were growing over Google, once a key Apple partner with the iPhone, making global waves with its Android technology. By licensing Android for free, Google developed software for most of Apple’s main smartphone and tablet manufacturing rivals.

He also told execs the company 'needed to catch up to Android where we are behind,' referring to 'notifications, tethering and speech' as three areas, while 
writing that Apple could overtake Android with features like Siri.

He added: 'Google and Microsoft are further along on the technology, but haven't quite figured it out.'

The email came to light as part of Apple’s lawsuit against Samsung over smartphone patents.

Tough competition: Towards the end of the email - headed by the words 'FYI - DO NOT FORWARD' - he suggests launching a 'Holy War with Google', bidding his underlings to suggest 'all the ways we will compete with them'

Apple is demanding $2billion in damages from Samsung, accusing the Korean technology giant of violating a batch of patents through its smartphones, including the rights to search technology that is part of the iPhone Siri voice feature.

Jobs was famed for his ruthless approach to business development and competition.

Last week another email revealed how Jobs reacted to news that he had got a Google 
employee sacked with a simple 'smiley face'.

He had taken issue with an attempt by the web giant to poach one of his engineers, apparently in violation of an alleged anti-competition agreement by the firms not to hire each other's staff.

'Stop doing this': Last week it was revealed Steve Jobs (left) e-mailed 
Google chairman Eric Schmidt (right) after learning of the approach by a
 Google recruiter in 2007. When he heard he had been sacked, Jobs replied with ':) Steve'

According to a cache of e-mails between the late Apple CEO and Google chairman Eric Schmidt in 2007, Jobs was furious after discovering that a Google recruiter had contacted one of his employees.

He told Schmidt: 'I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this.'

When Schmidt demanded an explanation from his HR department, he was told the culprit would be fired 'within the hour'.

Schmidt relayed this to Jobs, who replied with ':) Steve'.
