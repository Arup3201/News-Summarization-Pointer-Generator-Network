Not having it: Dave Dawson, left, responded to travellers moving on to his land by leaping into his digger and threatening to move them by force

When he found travellers’ caravans had arrived on his land, Dave Dawson had two options.

He could either alert the authorities and wait for the slow turning of the wheels of justice and officialdom.

Or he could rely on the somewhat quicker wheels of his digger – and remove the caravans by force.

Taking the second course of action, Mr Dawson put in a call to the police to inform them of his intentions, which risked leading to his arrest.

Officers arrived to oversee what appeared to be a few heated exchanges before – remarkably – the travellers left of their own accord.

His swift action stands in stark contrast to the decade-long battle to shift travellers from the notorious Dale Farm site in Essex, which only came to an end in October last year.

Mr Dawson, whose farm is near Shoreham in West Sussex, discovered the intruders early yesterday morning. ‘I would have used any force possible to get them off my land,’ he said. ‘I got down here about 6am and told them to move off. There were four vans there at the time and more parked up outside.

‘I came down with the digger and tractor and told them if they didn’t move I was going to move them.

‘I just won’t tolerate it. It is my land. I bought it and I have worked hard for it. I called the police and told them I was going to get the digger and move them.

‘I didn’t care if they got squashed, flattened or left on their own, but one way or another I was going to get them off my land.’

'It's my land': Undeterred by the sudden arrival of the travellers, Mr Dawson called police and told them he was prepared to remove the intruders by force

'I would have used any force possible': Officers were forced to stand between Mr Dawson's digger and the travellers' caravans to prevent him from carrying out his threats

It is believed that the went to Lancing Green, West Sussex, three miles from Mr Dawson's land

He said that at one point in the clash the officers had to stand between the two sides.

‘The police told me that once they are on the land they have rights. But what about my rights?’ Mr Dawson added.

‘If I had left it to the authorities 
they could have been on my land for weeks. I wasn’t going to wait for a 
court order to get rid of them.

‘As it was, the police threatened to 
arrest me. It has already cost me a day’s work and about £500 to repair 
the damage. They cut through a metal gate and put their own lock on it.’

A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 
‘Six caravans turned up on land at 6.45am. The landowner also turned up 
and threatened to evict the travellers.

Furious: Officers oversaw what appeared to be several heated exchanges between Mr Dawson and his uninvited guests

A traveller talks to officers: Mr Dawson feared that if he left the eviction to the authorities, the caravans could have been left on his land for weeks

‘Police attended and remained on scene
 to prevent a breach of peace. The travellers left the site of their own
 accord at 9.35am.’ Removing travellers who have occupied land without 
permission is usually a much more costly and time-consuming exercise.

At Dale Farm, the decade-long legal battle cost taxpayers an estimated £18million.

A total of 43 people were arrested and
 several injured after protesters fought running battles with riot 
police over the eviction of about 80 families from what was the UK’s 
largest illegal traveller settlement.

As soon as Basildon council had 
declared a final victory, there was a massive leap in the number of 
caravans pitched on the legal Oak Lane site next door – and an adjoining
 road – prompting more expensive legal action.

In 2009, a convoy pitched up at 
another controversial travellers’ site just hours after a group had been
 evicted following a six-year legal battle costing £400,000.

The new arrivals rolled on to a field 
adjoining the notorious Smithy Fen site at Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, 
where travellers had set up an illegal camp.

Bye bye: The travellers eventually moved off Mr Dawson's land at 9.45am - three hours after they had arrived
