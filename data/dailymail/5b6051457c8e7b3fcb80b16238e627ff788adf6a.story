Gareth Bale may have cost Real Madrid a huge £86million when he moved to the Spanish capital last summer but the Welshman has missed out on making FIFA 15's top 10 players.

On Saturday, EA Sports announced the players listed in places 20-11 in their countdown of the highest rated stars featured on this year's game.

While Bale missed out on the top 10 - coming in at No 14 despite his heroics in last season's Champions League final as Madrid finally achieved 'La Decima' - the former Tottenham man was joined in the next batch of revealed names alongside Real team-mates Luka Modric and Sergio Ramos.

Fresh from his World Cup success with Germany in Brazil, Philip Lahm, who has since retired from international duty, came 13th.
