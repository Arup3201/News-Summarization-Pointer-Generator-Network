Many a mother will know the feeling – you’re flitting around busily when suddenly one of your brood pipes up: ‘Mum! I’m hungry!’

Within seconds the rest of the flock have joined in the chorus and there’s nothing for it but to find some nice tasty flies to keep them quiet.

Flies? Well, that was the only thing that was going to please these recently fledged swallows spotted at St Michael’s Mount, Cornwall.

What about me?: The mother drops food into the beak of one of her young as its sibling swallows' jealously call out for their turn to get fed

In the main picture, mother can be seen top left as she circles in, ready to feed chick number one as the other two perform the bird equivalent of ‘Oi! What about me?’

Wildlife photographer Paul Williams, who took these pictures, said: ‘The parents feed their young up to 400 times a day but passing food can take less than a second. Blink and you’ll miss it.

‘The chicks are much better at spotting the adults coming back than I am, loudly begging and opening their mouths wide as they approach. I focused on the chicks and as soon as I saw the tell-tale signs my finger was ready on the trigger.’

Come back already: As their mother flies off, the swallows can be seen squawking in unison, most probably telling her they've still got room for more

Large flies make up to 80 per cent of their diet but they also eat aphids, flying ants and wasps.

Mr Williams said: ‘One chick received a wasp that was just too big to handle. Its sibling greedily poked his head close looking for an opportunity to steal it.’

August is peak season for swallows in Britain. Next month they will head for South Africa, flying up to 600 miles a day.
