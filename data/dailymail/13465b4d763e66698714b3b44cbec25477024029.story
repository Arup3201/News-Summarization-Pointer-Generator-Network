Wish there was somewhere cold to cool down during the summer heat-wave?

Well, the people of Kungur, in the Perm region of Russia, don't have that problem with this huge ice cave on their doorstep - which remains frozen even when it is 35C outside.

The caves, which are locked in what has been described as 'everlasting winter', feature a stunning array of frozen stalagmites and strange geometrical ice formations.

And they are also home to curious local legend, that if a lady falls along 'the women road' inside the cave, she will will soon be walking down the aisle with a royal suitor.

The story stems from a foreign princess who stumbled down the path and got engaged to a prince when she returned to the surface.

But, with 50 caves filled with shimmering crystals, it might have been an idea for him to propose while she was down there.

These frosty images were captured by Russian Photographer Viktor Lyagushkin, 42, who described the cave as 'dark, but beautiful'.

During his trip he was even allowed 
special access to the area where the lady 'Princess Louise' fell in 1914
and also left her signature on a boulder.

He said: 'According to the legend, the young Princess Louise fell down at these slippery stairs and injured her knee.

'Now, it is believed if a girl falls down here and injures her knee, she will marry a prince, as Princess Louise did.

'But the tourists cannot see the princesses' signature. It is located in the abandoned part of the cave, near an old entrance.

'The most impressive crystals grow 
there, but at the moment it is quite dangerous to be there because of 
the rotted, wooden roof-supports.

'Also you would need to squeeze through narrow places.'

The cave has a total length of 5,700m but the main tourists routes measure about 2,000m. There are about 50 grottos - the biggest of which is 50,000m3 - and about 70 lakes.

The ceilings and walls are covered with thick layers of crystals and Viktor describes it as like being 'in a jewellery box'.

He added: 'It was in summer when we 
were to the Kungur Ice Cave for the first time so we were very surprised
with the cold wind there.

'The air temperature inside the cave is below zero, even in summer.

'That is why the ice crystals do not 
melt. Climate there is strongly continental, and heat of summer touched 
on 35C, so it was a strange thing to find the realm of everlasting 
winter.'

The Kungur Ice Cave, which are now a major tourist attraction, has been nominated to enter the UNESCO World Heritage List.Â
