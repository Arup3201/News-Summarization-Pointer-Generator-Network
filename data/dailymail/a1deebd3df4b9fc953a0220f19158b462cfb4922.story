She is the Queen of Soul and they are bigger hitters in the world of politics.

But despite being an unlikely trio, both Eric Holder and the Reverend Al Sharpton got together to help celebrate the 73rd birthday of Aretha Franklin on Sunday night.

The outgoing attorney general and the civil rights activist joined guests from the world of music for the annual party at New York's Ritz Carlton hotel.

Both Mr Holder and the Rev Sharpton are close friends of the singer. Mr Holder was with his wife Sharon Malone, while Rev Sharpton was accompanied by date Aisha McShaw

The singer, who doesn't actually turn 73 until Wednesday, has become known for holding star-studded parties to mark her birthday.

At last night's celebration, Miss Franklin, who wore a sparkling silver dress blew out the candles on her cake and was even treated to a chorus of 'Happy Birthday' sang by Labelle singer Sarah Dash.

Miss Franklin has been a long time friend of both Mr Holder and Reverend Sharpton.

Earlier this year, she sang at a ceremony to announce Mr Holder would be stepping down from his position of Attorney General.

The singer wore a silver sparkling dress with a coat as she walked the red carpet on the way to her party 

She sang 'America The Beautiful' as an homage to Mr Holder, who was visibly moved by the gesture.

It was reported that as she approached the podium to sing, President Barack Obama rushed to her side and handed her a stepping stool with the words, 'Hold on, Queen.'

It is thought that she has become good friends with Mr Holder and his wife Sharon.

Meanwhile Miss Franklin was last seen partying with the Rev Sharpton at his 60th birthday party last October, where she described him as a 'man among men'.

At one point during the party, New York mayor Bill de Blasio was addressing the Reverend.

But he was soon cut off by Mr Sharpton as Miss Franklin entered the room, with him saying: 'I don’t usually interrupt the mayor, but the Queen is in the room.'
