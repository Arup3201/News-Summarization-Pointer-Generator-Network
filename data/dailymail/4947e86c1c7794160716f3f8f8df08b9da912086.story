'Ambassadors': Sir John Major said One Direction and Susan Boyle are ambassadors for Britain

Boy band One Direction and Britain’s Got Talent singer Susan Boyle now rival the Queen as key brand ambassadors for Britain, Sir John Major said last night.

The former Prime Minister said that Harry Styles and his fellow bandmates, along with singer Adele, Premier League football and shows such as Downton Abbey have increased ‘trust’ in the UK around the world.

Sir John told a House of Lords committee investigating ‘soft power’ diplomacy that hard power, like the Armed Forces, is now more difficult to use.

He argued that Britain needs to cash in on advantages like the English language, the BBC World Service and the Monarchy to make friends around the world.

Sir John said the Queen and some pop music figures are ‘subliminal’ reasons why foreigners like Britain.

‘When people refer to the Queen they almost always mean our Queen,’ he said. ‘Wherever you go Bond will be known and so, these days, will be Downton Abbey.

‘All of these reflect a rather favourable impression on Britain. We’ve had over 20 British albums top the charts in countries around the world. It’s not just the established stars like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

‘You have Adele, One Direction, Susan Boyle. Wherever you go, they’re household names and they have an implication for perception and thus soft power. That is a background that few countries can match in terms of profile and that is important for our diplomacy. Because of these elements of soft power, and because of our history, there is...a greater tendency to trust the British in diplomacy.’

Earlier this month, One Direction’s third album, Midnight Memories, entered the US Billboard 200 at number one making them the only group to have their first three albums top the chart in their opening week.

Sir John also warned that Britain will be ‘diminished’ in the eyes of the world if the UK leaves the European Union or Scotland votes for independence.

The former Tory Prime Minister said the UK Independence Party and Conservative ‘europhobes’ are damaging Britain abroad.

‘I have not a shred of doubt that we are better off in than out. To lose our biggest market would be folly on a grand scale.

‘There are people who trade under the banner of Euroscepticism but they want us out. Whether they’re in Ukip or any other party, that is damaging.’ Sir John, who began the discussions with the IRA that led to the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, warned that leaving the EU would mean border controls between Northern and Southern Ireland that would ‘unsettle’ the local population and unpick the stability of the peace process.

‘Ireland would have really legitimate cause to worry.’ Sir John said that when he travels the world the prospect of Scotland quitting the UK and the UK leaving the EU were raised with him frequently.

‘If Scotland were to vote for independence I think it would be bad for Scotland. It certainly would be bad for the United Kingdom.’ He said foreign leaders are ‘baffled’ about why Scotland would leave.

‘They would perceive a country that was damaged and diminished if a chunk of it voluntarily chose to leave the United Kingdom.’ Sir John also warned that Alex Salmond is wrong to say Scotland could continue as a member of the EU. The belief that because they are in the European Union as part of the United Kingdom, they would automatically be when they left is fallacy. They would not.

‘They would have to apply to rejoin at a time when the European Union is in no hurry about new members. I’m sure they would get in but it would take them 10 years and who knows what conditions of entry they would get.’
