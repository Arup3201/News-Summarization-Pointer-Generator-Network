Four young mothers were killed today when their car slammed into a support beam of an elevated train track with enough force for the vehicle
 to split in two.

Tyshyra Hines, 21, Bernadette Harris, 25 and Alicia Josten, 22, were pronounced dead at the scene.

The fourth victim Ieshia Nelson, 21, who was the driver, was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago but later died in the Mother's Day crash.

Mangled: Investigators document the car crash which happened as four friends were on their way to a party

Chicago Police Department spokesman Hector Alfaro said the car was traveling fast when it hit a cement beam that supports Chicago Transit Authority train tracks on the city's West Side before it ran into a light pole.

The vehicle crashed with enough force that it split in two, according to fire officials. Police were investigating the cause of the crash, which happened just after midnight on Sunday.

Miss Nelson's mother, Yvette Harris, 
said her daughter's two-year-old son did not yet know that she had died. 

Mrs Harris told CBS: 'I took him to his grandparents' last night, because he couldn't go to the hospital with me.

'And I don't know what I'm going to say because when I left, he asked me, ''You going to get Eesh? My mommy?'' I don't know what I'm going to say.'

Mrs Harris said that her daughter had been driving 
and that the four were on their way to a party. Miss Nelson was studying
 to be a nurse and had just turned 21 on May 1.

Miss Harris' sister, Sheila Harris, 
told the Chicago Tribune that her sister was a devoted parent to three

'She'd go above and beyond for her kids,' she said. 'She was an outstanding mother.'

Another
 victim of the crash was identified as Tyshaira Hines, 22, by her aunt. 
Pearl Henderson said her niece worked at McDonald's and has a 
five-year-old son.
