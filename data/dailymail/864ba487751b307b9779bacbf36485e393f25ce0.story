A young motorist who lost control of his car somehow managed to reverse the vehicle into a house, ploughing through the kitchen wall. 

The silver Ford Focus became lodged halfway up the wall of Alan Stone's house in Shelfield, West Midlands, when the 20-year-old lost control at lunchtime on Monday. 

He was travelling with a 17-year-old girl in the passenger seat, though no one is thought to have been hurt in the incident. 

The driver was arrested on suspicion of taking a vehicle without the owner's consent.
