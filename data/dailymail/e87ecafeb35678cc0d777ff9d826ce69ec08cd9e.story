An entire family who work for Avon say the door-to-door cosmetics giant has funded their luxurious lifestyle of sumptuous holidays, cars, shopping and even a new home.

The Shaws, dubbed the Avon family, say they 'don't think twice' about jetting off to places like the Algarve in Portugal, Spain and Cyprus.

Mother Erena, 48, was able to pay cash for a car and a brand new kitchen and conservatory for their Northampton home after becoming a sales leader for the firm and raking in £52,000 a year.

Her husband Dave, 52, followed suit and also got a job at Avon after he was made redundant from his role as head of purchasing at a local brewery.

The couple's two daughters, Amy, 27, and Zoe, 25, grew up surrounded by beauty products and when they turned 18 they too signed up, spending around five to 10 hours a week knocking on doors.

Erena and Dave's youngest daughter Charlotte, 13, has been nicknamed the 'Avon baby' and they expect her to follow them into what they call the 'family business'.

Zoe said: 'Our friends all thought it was funny at first, and some were quite scathing, but now they have seen how well we have done.'

The girls have managed to get themselves onto the property ladder after their parents were able to give them a deposit with money saved from their Avon earnings.

And the sisters, who both have full-time jobs as well as working for the beauty company, have enough spare cash to run the three-bedroomed semi-detached house in their home town of Northampton, East Midlands.

Zoe, a customer service advisor, is also saving for a car, while Amy, a legal worker, prefers to spend on bags, shoes and clothes.

Sales representatives make £1 for 
every £4 sold.

The highest earning Avon Sales Leaders make over 
£100,000 a year. Others who do it part time may only make £500 a month.

Dave and Erena work anything between 20 to 40 hours a week.

Erena, who has worked at Avon for 12-years, said: 'I started work at Avon soon after I unexpectedly got pregnant with my youngest daughter Charlotte.

'I decided I wanted to stay at home with her, but I found myself wanting to go out and meet people, so I signed up to Avon as a sales rep.'

In her first year Erena worked just a few hours a week but was able to save enough to pay for a family holiday to Cyprus.

Erena loved her new job so much that after just ten months she progressed to the position of sales leader, and now makes £52,000 a year.

Two years ago husband Dave was made redundant and instead of looking for another job he decided to follow his wife and become an Avon rep himself.

Avon sells over 3.5 billion products a year to 300 million customers

Erena
 added: 'We decided that Dave would do all the stuff I'd been doing, 
such as the school runs, and fit Avon around it. Balancing work and 
family life could be stressful. He worked long hours and late nights.'

'The flexibility at Avon means that he can spend as much time with Charlotte as he likes and earn cash when he chooses.'

Dave was made redundant on December 30 2010 and has helped with Avon ever since Erena started her business.

He became an Avon Representative in January 2011 and a few months later became a Sales Leader.

Zoe said: 'Charlotte loves all the Avon stuff, especially all the Hello Kitty products.

Being a teenager she also really likes the skincare range. I'm sure she'll start working for Avon some time soon too.'

Amy started working for Avon aged 18 when she was chosen to represent her county on a girl guides camp in America and needed to raise £2,000 to do so.

She was soon able to achieve her goal and has been working for the company ever since.

Zoe added: 'Because of Avon I have my spare cash at the weekends. It is completely flexible and your earning power is unlimited.

'We can't imagine our lives without Avon.'

Avon was established in America more than 120 years ago by a door-to-door bookseller who gave away vials of perfume to female customers.

He soon set up a business selling toiletries directly to customers after he realised they liked the samples more than the books.

Avon is the world's leading direct seller of beauty and related products, with over £6.75billion in annual revenue.

Avon Representatives each run their own independent business, with control over the hours they work and money they make.

Avon reaches women in over 100 countries through over six million sales representatives and sells over 3.5 billion products a year to 300 million customers.

As part of the brand’s reinvention, which has seen it tap into a younger generation, it has secured partnerships with celebrity ambassadors including Reese Witherspoon, Fergie, Ashley Greene and Yasmin le Bon.

One in three women in the UK is an Avon customer.

Every second, four Avon lipsticks and two Avon mascaras are sold somewhere in the world.

The 'Avon Lady' is an enduring and iconic image and the 'Ding Dong Avon Calling' ad campaign of the sixties is still fondly remembered.
