A mother suffering from postnatal depression killed her six-week-old baby after refusing to take medication that would have helped her cope, a court heard yesterday.

Natasha Sultan fractured the skull of her only child Amelia-Lilly in ‘an eruption of frustration’ before climbing into bed and falling asleep.

Sultan, 21, had been prescribed anti-depressants by her GP but only took one tablet because of the ‘stigma’ associated with postnatal depression.

Hull Crown Court heard Natasha Sultan (pictured), 21, from Hull, killed her baby daughter after shunning medication because she wanted to avoid the 'stigma' of the condition

The court heard that her mind was ‘disturbed’ at the time of her daughter’s death, which might have been avoided if she had taken the pills.

She wept as she appeared in the dock at Hull Crown Court, where she pleaded guilty to a charge of infanticide.

Sultan and her boyfriend James Curtis had been living in a house in Hull with their daughter, who was born last year on August 28. Only a few weeks after the birth, on October 7, Mr Curtis left to start a night shift working as a security guard, leaving his partner at home with Amelia-Lilly.

At 10.30pm she sent him a text message which said she was planning to get some rest as the baby was asleep.

But when he got home at 8am the following morning, Mr Curtis found his daughter lying unconscious and cold in her cot. He desperately tried to revive her and called an ambulance but Amelia-Lilly was pronounced dead the following day.

Sultan initially told hospital staff that she had tripped and dropped the baby. However an X-ray revealed a bilateral fracture of her skull which was ‘non-accidental’.

Prosecutor Tim Roberts said only ‘significant’ force would have produced bilateral fractures. He added: ‘The severity of the injuries were inconsistent with the accident fall from waist height to a carpeted bedroom floor.’

Malcolm Swift, defending, explained that Sultan had been diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth.

He said: ‘The drugs that could have saved this from happening were not taken. It’s just a matter of circumstance and regret that those tablets weren’t taken.’ Sultan, who was originally charged with murder, has been using a public Facebook page to pay tribute to her daughter.

Alongside one picture of Amelia-Lilly 
she has written: ‘Our gorgeous little princess RIP darling. It was the 
best time of our lives.’

A death notice posted in their local newspaper described the baby girl as the ‘special daughter of Natasha and James’.

It said: ‘You kicked your socks and scratch mittens off. You always peeped to see if one of us were holding you.

Hull Crown Court heard Sultan admitted the rare charge of infanticide on the grounds that she suffered a 'temporary unbalance' of her mind

‘You are our first baby, a beautiful daughter born.

‘All
that we have left are photos and memories of your hiccups and, most of 
all, memories of you. Love and miss you so much baby girl.’

Judge
Jeremy Richardson explained that the crime of infanticide, which is 
‘very rare’, carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. But the 
court heard that ‘virtually all’ past sentences have been non-custodial.

He
said: ‘The facts are clear. You killed your child, your wanted and 
loved baby, while the balance of your mind was disturbed.’

However he said he would need to take some time to consider the case before delivering a sentence.

‘This
is both an anxious and difficult case and a little time for reflection 
is needed by me in order that I deal justly,’ he said.
