A woman who pleaded no contest to breaking into reality television starlet Audrina Patridge's home has been sentenced to four years in prison.

Rachel Lee, 21, is the second member of the so-called 'Bling Ring' gang to be sentenced for their role in a rash of break-ins at celebrities' homes that netted more than $3million (£1.9million) in luxury goods.

The group targeted the Los Angeles homes of stars including Orlando Bloom, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan before members of the ring were arrested in late 2009.

Lee was arrested in January 2010 and later pleaded no contest to the February 2009 burglary of The Hills star Patridge's Hollywood Hills home.

More than $25,000 (£15,650) in designer luggage, jewellery, clothing and shoes were taken from the property, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.

A hearing will be held at a later date to determine how much Lee has to repay.

Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler dismissed a conspiracy to commit burglary charge and two counts of receiving stolen property that had been filed against Lee. The judge had previously dismissed a charge against Lee related to the Lohan burglary.

Four other alleged members of the crew, including accused ringleader Nicholas Prugo, are awaiting trial.

Alexis Neiers, an aspiring model and star of the E! Entertainment Television show Pretty Wild, pleaded no contest in May 2010 to burgling Orlando Bloom's home and was sentenced to six months in jail and three years of probation.

Patridge testified before a grand jury about returning to her home on Oscar night 2009 and finding it had been looted.

She told the grand jury: 'So I locked myself in the closet. And I was still on the phone with my sister and I was afraid to hang up, because I didn't know if someone was still in my house.

'I just wanted to be safe.'

The starlet never appeared in court during Lee's trial.
