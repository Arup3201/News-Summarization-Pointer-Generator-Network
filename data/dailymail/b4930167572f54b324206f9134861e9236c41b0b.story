Andre Villas Boas has slammed Tim Sherwood after the former Tottenham manager criticised his successor's ability to maintain a united dressing room following his departure.

When speaking about the time he took over at the north London club, Villas Boas pulled no punches.

'Tim was not part of my team, but I already alerted the president that he was detrimental to the club.'

Ex-Spurs player Sherwood took over from Villas Boas after the Portuguese parted ways with chairman Daniel Levy in December 2013, following a string of disappointing domestic league results. 

'(Sherwood) continued after I left and his leadership resulted in a extreme split between the players and the coach,' Villas Boas said.  

After 18 months in charge Villas Boas exited White Hart Lane with the highest league win percentage  of any manager in the club's Premier League era, until Sherwood. 

The Englishman assumed Villas Boas' position in the hotseat, winning half of his 28 Premier League games as manager before being sacked by Levy at the close of last season. 

Current Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino responded to Sherwood's criticism of defender Jan Vertonghen 

Sherwood shocked fans back in March when the then Spurs boss accused his squad of lacking character following a 4-0 defeat at Chelsea in March and refused to apologise.

Earlier this month, current boss Mauricio Pochettino was forced to leap to the defence of defender Jan Vertonghen, after 45-year-old Sherwood questioned his ability at the back.

Pochettino – who succeeded the axed Sherwood at White Hart Lane in the summer – said: 'People can have their opinions but I am very happy with Jan.

'I am not aware of these comments. I give my opinions in private. I think Jan in his first season was maybe the best central defender in England.

'Maybe last season he was not as good but he is still a very important player for us.'
