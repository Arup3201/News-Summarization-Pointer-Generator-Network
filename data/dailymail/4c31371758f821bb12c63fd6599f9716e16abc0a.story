A cinema asked a disabled man to leave half way through a film and told him not to return on busy weekends because other customers found his life-saving ventilator too noisy. 

Richard Bridger was watching Taken 3 with his carer at the Odeon Cinema in Epsom, Surrey, when an employee approached the pair to ask them to leave 40 minutes into the film.

The 31-year-old, whose Duchenne muscular dystrophy confines him to an electric wheelchair, was then told not to return on Saturday nights by the member of staff. 

Richard Bridger was thrown out of a cinema after viewers complained his ventilator was too loud. The 31-year-old (pictured with his father, Steve) has Duchenne muscular dystrophy 

It came after six of the 200 people watching the film complained that Mr Bridger's ventilator was making too much noise. 

The incident was described as 'disgusting' by Mr Bridger's father who added the sound of his son's ventilator is no louder than that of rustling crisp packets and crunching popcorn. 

'When we are at home we can watch a TV programme with it on, if he was texting or answering phone calls during the film I could understand it but he can't do any of those things because he doesn't have the physical strength to do them,' Steve Bridger said. 

'Richard has been going to the cinema since it opened and, in the last four years, has required the use of the ventilator to keep his carbon dioxide levels down which can be life-threatening if they are raised too high.

'All he wanted to do was go out and watch a film and it takes a lot of organisation to arrange for Richard to go out.

'I find it disgusting that, in this age, a person who is mentally capable - Richard has 14 GCSEs and a degree - but relies on life-saving equipment, should be treated in this way.

'This is total discrimination. Odeon doesn’t take disability seriously enough.'

While Mr Bridger's ventilator makes some noise, it is no worse than the sound of rustling crisp packets of crunching popcorn, his father said

Outraged, Mr Bridger visited the cinema to complain but was told by the general manager that the right decision had been made. 

Disabled rights campaigners described Mr Bridger's treatment as 'rude' and 'discriminatory', adding that those bothered by the sound of the ventilator could have moved seats. 

'Due to his Duchenne muscular dystrophy, he often needs a ventilator to breathe,' said Victoria Wright Campaigns Officer for the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign Trailblazers. 

'If the noise unfortunately disturbed other customers, then you would hope they would make the compassionate choice to move seats. 

'Richard, on the other hand, has no choice but to use his ventilator to breathe.

'To remove Richard from the cinema and imply he can only come at certain, less popular times because of his disability, was insensitive and discriminatory.

'To talk to his carer instead of him directly was also extremely rude.' 

A spokesman for Odeon said: 'We sincerely apologise for the way this matter was handled and for the upset it caused.

'We are inviting Mr Bridger and his son to return and enjoy Taken 3 at any time as guests of Odeon Epsom.

'We are also looking again at what happened to ensure it never happens again.'
