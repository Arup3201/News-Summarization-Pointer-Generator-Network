A brazen thief has stolen the £4,000 bicycle of GB triathlete Jessica Earp from outside Birbeck University in London.

Ms Earp had removed the front wheel from her bike and chained it to a bike rack to discourage any possible thieves. 

However, one criminal spotted the bike and hacked-off the lock, but only after stealing the front wheel from a second bicycle and riding off. 

Police are looking for this man who is accused of stealing GB triathlete Jessica Earp's £4,000 bicycle
