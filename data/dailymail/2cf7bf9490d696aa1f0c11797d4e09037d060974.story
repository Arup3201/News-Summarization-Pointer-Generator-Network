Cardiff have completed the signing of Birmingham midfielder Tom Adeyemi on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.

The 22-year-old, who becomes the Bluebirds' sixth summer signing, trained with his new team-mates on Thursday morning and is eligible to face Blackburn in the Championship season opener on Friday evening.

Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer moved quickly to replace Jordon Mutch, who joined newly-promoted QPR in a £6million deal earlier this week.

The former Manchester United striker said: 'I’ve been keeping an eye on Tom’s progress for a very long time. 

'A few years ago, my Manchester United reserve side played against Norwich’s first team and Tom was their standout player. He scored a great goal that day and stood out as a fine talent, even at that young age.

'Tom has a physical presence, drive and energy – up and down the pitch. He can dictate games and is great at winning and anticipating second balls. We’ve been interested all summer and I’m thrilled we’ve got our man ahead of the season kick-off.'

Adeyemi, who declined an offer to attend Cambridge University to pursue his football career, handed in a transfer request at St Andrew's to force through a move to south Wales.

He said: 'I took no persuading from the manager to come here. It was a fantastic opportunity for me to work with somebody like him and to play for a club like Cardiff City. 

'I’m very pleased that everything has been completed ahead of the season and now I can focus on fighting for a place in the side and helping us get the season off to a great start.'
