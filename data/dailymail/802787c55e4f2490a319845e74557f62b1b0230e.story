A well-meaning pet owner who tried to treat her cat’s limp with paracetamol ended up in court after accidentally killing it.

Claire Pritchard, 45, noticed her black cat, Midnight, was struggling to walk properly so fed her a quarter of a 500mg tablet in a bid to ease its pain.

She gave the two-year-old cat a second quarter of the painkiller the following morning but ended up poisoning her with the drug, which is only suitable for human consumption.

When Midnight collapsed on June 21, Pritchard contacted the RSPCA and the animal was rushed to a vet.

Although she was given a saline drip to combat dehydration and to give her an energyboost, Midnight died from organ failure.

Pritchard, from Bournemouth, Dorset, told an RSPCA inspector that she thought cats could take paracetamol after seeing her mother do it as a child.

She was prosecuted by the RSPCA under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, and pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal, and for not catering to her needs.

Graham Hammond, a spokesman for the 
charity, said: 'A cat cannot digest paracetamol the same way a human can
 because it doesn’t have the same enzyme that is required, so it just 
packed up its internal organs.

'Mrs
 Pritchard’s argument was that she thought that’s what you did with cats
 because she had seen her mother do it as a child, but that could have 
been a cat medicine.

'At 
the time she didn’t know she had done wrong, but she didn’t take the cat
 to the vets in the first place despite having other cats registered 
with the PDSA.'

Pritchard was given a two-year conditional discharge by magistrates in Bournemouth who did not impose a ban on her keeping animals. She was ordered to pay £280 in court costs.

She today accused the RSPCA of persecuting her over Midnight's death.

The grandmother said: 'I think generally the RSPCA do a great job but they will persecute and harass you if they think you have done wrong.

'I couldn't believe the RSPCA prosecuted me. When their guy came to take a statement from me I was shocked at the way he spoke to me.'

She claims that Midnight may have died from an undiagnosed abscess rather than a drugs overdose.

She said: 'I have had pets since I was a child and know how to look after them. I have been giving cats a little bit of paracetamol for years without any problems.

'The cat died in the care of the RSPCA care and experts have told me that they don't know if it was the paracetamol or the abscess.'

Mrs Pritchard has two other cats, called Maisie Moo-Moo and Sidilicious, and a dog called Barney Boo.
