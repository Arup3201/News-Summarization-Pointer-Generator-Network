Chris Ashton may not be known for his close-quarter work at the breakdown but it was the England wing’s late intervention which kept Saracens’ European hopes alive while simultaneously sinking Sale’s.

With the Sharks’ pack battering the visitors’ line following a succession of penalties, Saracens’ season hung in the balance.

But with seconds on the clock, and the ball centimetres short of the line, Ashton did his finest impression of Richie McCaw to force his hands over the ball — possibly illegally — and persuade Welsh referee Leighton Hodges to penalise Sale for holding on.

‘I thought our defence in our 22 in the last five minutes was pretty heroic,’ said relieved Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘There were a lot of the characteristics I associate with this team which were present all the way through. Our performance wasn’t perfect but we showed a lot of energy.

‘Chris Ashton had a lot of good interventions today. There were several occasions when we had numbers down in defence and he came off his line and timed tackles magnificently.

‘His turnover at the end was pretty special but he had a great game. He doesn’t often get the credit for those kind of things.’

McCall’s opposite number Steve Diamond, who berated Hodges and his fellow officials after the final whistle, said: ‘We were hammering their line, penalty after penalty. Probably in the Premiership we’d have got a yellow card.

‘Fair play to them. Good defence in the last five minutes won them the game. They’re a good side and they pushed the boundaries of offside quite a lot. There was probably a bit of inexperience from that referee coming out of the Celtic League and not being used to streetwise sides like Saracens.’

The match was billed as a battle of the fly-halves as Sale’s Danny Cipriani took on Owen Farrell, even though the latter lined up at inside-centre, with former Sale stand-off Charlie Hodgson at 10 for Sarries.

None of the three will look back on the match with any great fondness, although Farrell scored a try and kicked an important 65th-minute drop goal to pull Saracens four points clear after the hulking Andrei Ostrikov had rumbled over from 15 metres to give Sale hope.

Farrell’s try following a superb Hodgson break — aided by some woeful Sale defence — came after the impressive Magnus Lund had scored the first try of the match before the Saracens No 10 was forced from the field with a shoulder injury six minutes before the break.

Cipriani, meanwhile, will be frustrated by some sloppy kicking from hand and occasionally flaky defence.

Despite some neat touches from promising young full-back Mike Haley and some thunderous tackling from centre Sam Tuitupou, it was left to Sale’s forwards, with the Russian Ostrikov and Lund to the fore, to take the game to a Saracens side struggling for any rhythm in Europe or domestically.

Returning England lock George Kruis enjoyed another impressive afternoon’s work for Saracens, who must now beat Clermont Auvergne away and Munster at home to be confident of qualifying from the competition’s toughest Pool but they will need a much improved performance to stand a chance of progressing. 

They face Sale, whose interest in the tournament is now over, at Allianz Park next week, when they will again be without centre Brad Barriitt, who is expected to be out of action for four weeks after injuring his calf playing for England against Australia last week.

McCall said: ‘Brad pulled his calf in the last game for England. It’s hugely disappointing for us to lose him for four weeks when he comes back with a pretty significant injury like that. But that’s life. We just roll on.’
