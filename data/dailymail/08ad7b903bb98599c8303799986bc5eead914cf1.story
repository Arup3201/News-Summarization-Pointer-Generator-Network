If you've ever wondered what goes on inside the Bank of England, with its gold vaults and piles of cash, you can finally find out.

The famous building has thrown its doors to the world today, with the launch of its Virtual Tour app that gives users a tour of the mysterious institution.

Available to download free of charge via the Apple Store and Google Play marketplace, the App takes visitors on a virtual tour of the central bank’s historic building, with 360° panoramic views.

The new app offers access to the gold vault of the UK's central bank with previously unseen panoramic photos

Not many people would usually get to see the Court Room, where the Bank of England's governing body, the Court of Directors meets, but the app gives us a sneak peek.
The original design was by Sir Robert Taylor and dates from 1774 but the room was moved in the 1930s

The app allows users to find information about the workings of the bank. Here, a picture of a stash of banknotes is annotated with facts such as that there are around two billion banknotes in circulation

The highlight of the tour is arguably 
the bank's staggering gold vaults - one of the largest in the world - 
that houses over 400,000 bars of the precious metal.

While gold plays no role in the Bank’s policy decisions today, it 
remains a mark of stability and value.

The bank keeps the valuable bars safe
for the UK government, other central banks around the world and members of 
the London Bullion Market Association but actually only owns two standard size bars and two Roman bars itself.

It is hard to imagine how much the room is worth in total as the value of a gold bar in June was around £350,000.

Amazingly no gold has ever been stolen from the bank apart from in films and an episode of Thunderbirds.

The tour also visits the cash vault 
where the Bank holds a portion of its vast stock of banknotes, of which 
there are approximately two billion in circulation.

The Cantilever staircase was completed during the Herbert Baker re-building of the Threadneedle Street premises between 1935 and 1939. It is located in the front hall of the bank and was among the longest in Europe. It overlooks an original Roman mosaic

The app shows virtual visitors treasures such as this mosaic. It was created by Boris Anrep, a Russian whose work can also be seen in Westminster Cathedral and the National Gallery

The bank has been issuing notes for 
over 300 years, although early banknotes were simply receipts for gold 
deposited at the bank.

There are over £50 billion worth of 
banknotes in circulation and the bank issues around one billion new 
ones every year as well as destroying the old ones.

App users can also learn about the security features on each of the Bank’s notes in the app's ‘know your banknotes’ feature.

Virtual visitors can explore the 
Garden Court, a surprising garden feature at the heart of the building that is 
planted with mulberry trees, which were used to make the first paper 
money issued in 10th century China.

The bank also shares the gruesome tale of the 'bank giant' with the public in its first app.

A former clerk at the bank who was two metres tall was buried in the garden in 1798 to protect it from grave snatchers.

Less surprisingly, the Bank of 
England’s monetary policy and financial stability roles are also 
illustrated in the tour, with a visit to the room where the Monetary 
Policy Committee meets to set interest rates every month.

Doors to the committee room, where interest rates are decided, were originally designed to prevent eavesdropping.

The secret Garden Court at the Bank of England. It has its origins in the churchyard of St Christopher-le-Stocks, which was demolished in 1782 to make way for the expansion of the Bank. One of the conditions of the Act of Parliament permitting the demolition of the church was that the graveyard remain undisturbed - and so it was until the re-building of the Bank in the 1920s and 1930s when it was centralised behind the new Threadneedle Street entrance to the Bank

The Front Hall of the Bank of England houses a mini model of its inner buildings, some of which the general public will be able to explore for the first time using the bank's first app

Symbols reflecting money and finance are everywhere inside the bank and you can spot plenty of lions and eagles, which represent the relationship between the pound and the dollar.

The mosaics featured in the app tour are based upon coin designs from Roman times until the 1920s.

The mosaic seen at the base the bank's impressive staircase is actually one of three uncovered by excavations during the building of the bank and is believed to be from a 2nd century Roman villa that once stood on this site.

Most of the Threadneedle Street building is, of course, a working space devoted to monetary and financial stability.

But it is also a recognisable 
landmark to many people, and the app provides a unique glimpse of some 
of the bank’s more significant locations behind its familiar facade.

The Bank of England's first virtual tour app is available for Apple and Android devices and can also be accessed on computers

The app also includes a 'know your banknote' feature that shows different marks of authenticity - handy for spotting if you have a fake
