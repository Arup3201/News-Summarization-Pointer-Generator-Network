Taking a walk through the Lake District early this month you could have been forgiven for thinking you had spotted a musical legend frozen in time.

For, as the snow fell and the ice took grip of Red Tarn lake, the outline of a face emerged from the icy waters.

Photographer Daz Slater captured this image of the expanse of water, one of the highest in the Lakes, lying at an altitude of 2,356 feet.

In it, he saw the image of Reggae legend Bob Marley.

The way the snow has fallen on the shoreline and the pattern of the ice in the waters, show the outline of the lake resembles a man's head.

And the figurehead appears as though it could be wearing one of the colourful beanie hats, often worn by the Jamaican singer-songwriter, who started his career as the frontman for The Wailers.

Marley, known for a string of hits including No Woman, No Cry and I Shot The Sheriff, died of cancer in May 1981 at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami.

But for those fans hoping to catch a glimpse of the star's face in the waters of Red Tarn, might be disappointed.

For once the icy and snow has thawed, the outline of the lake takes on a more rugged and random appearance.

The Tarn has a depth of 82 feet, and the lake's head wall rises 1,000 feet to the summit of Helvellyn.

It is enclosed by the forbiding Striding Edge and Swirral Edge.

The lake was formed when the glacier that carved out the eastern side of Helvellyn melted.

It is fed by a number of streams running down its rear wall down into the corrie and it flows outward into Glenridding Beck.

In the nineteenth century Red Tarn was dammed, using boulders, which raised the water level some eight or nine feet in order to supply power to the Greenside Lead Mine at Glenridding.
