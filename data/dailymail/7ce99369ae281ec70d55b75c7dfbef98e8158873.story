Three lucky punters had a day to remember on Saturday, as joint FA Cup favourites Chelsea and Manchester City were dumped out of the competition.

When putting a bet on, most could be forgiven for backing the favourites - especially when it comes to the Premier League big boys - but a risk paid off as one SkyBet customer won £36,000 for a £2 stake.

Elsewhere, another punter had £100 on the Middlesbrough and Bradford double - backing the two favourites to crash out - and even they must have been surprised come full time when £29,000 dropped into their account.

Completing the trio of huge SkyBet wins, a £2 five-fold including Bradford, Boro, Leicester (who beat Tottenham), Crystal Palace (who knocked Southampton out at St Mary's) and Derby (who brushed aside Chesterfield) won an unexpected £24,000.

After the shocks of Saturday afternoon - and Liverpool's failure to beat Bolton, Crystal Palace are currently the highest-ranked of the teams left in the competition ahead of Sunday's games. 

Manchester United, who were themselves held to a goalless draw by Sky Bet League 2 side Cambridge United on Friday night, have been installed as Sky Bet's 3/1 favourites to lift the trophy from holders Arsenal, who are 7/2 second favourites.
