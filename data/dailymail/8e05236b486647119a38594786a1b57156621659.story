Amir Khan may be well-versed in the art of the knockout, but when it comes to the check-out the boxer from Bolton is not such a dab hand.

Former world champion Khan has revealed he struggles to do the weekly shop on his own after his wife sent him to Asda on Monday night.

Khan was happy to admit he couldn't cope before roping in a member of staff to help him tick all the items off his list.

The 28-year-old, who is desperate to fight Floyd Mayweather, took to Twitter to explain his difficulties as he shared a picture of the Asda employee who had assisted him in filling up his trolley.

'My wife sent me shopping. Been stuck here for an hour. Thank god I met @adamjariyo, he's been a great help @asda'.

The contents of Khan's trolley included packets of instant mash potato Smash, pizzas, potato waffles, spinach, bottled water and nappies for seven-month old daughter Lamysa.
