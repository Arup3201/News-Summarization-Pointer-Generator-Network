Letting out a mighty roar after scoring a goal, this was Britain’s blue-haired wheelchair rugby player David Anthony in action last night.

A capacity crowd of 10,000 cheered on Anthony and the rest of the team as they took on reigning champions United States in the fast and furious sport once known as ‘murderball’.

The crowd ensured an electric atmosphere for the eagerly awaited tournament launch of a sport that can feature ferocious clashes between players.

Violent collisions saw players go 
flying, prompting the commentator to shout: ‘What a hit!’ Regular stops 
in play allowed a team of helpers to sprint from the touchline and right
 upended chairs, caused by tough tackles.

The huge hits, met with gasps 
and groans from the crowd, could be heard high up in the packed stadium,
 and left stricken players prone on the floor.

There were also regular 
pauses for chairs to undergo a mid-court ‘pit stop’ as damaged wheels 
were replaced.

The GB team put on a brave display but
 eventually lost 56-44 in their pool match.

Captain Steve Brown’s team 
are widely viewed as strong medal contenders, and they led 13-11 after a
 fierce opening quarter at the Basketball Arena.

Despite a 16-goal display from star 
performer Aaron Phipps and an 11-goal contribution by Anthony, however, 
they could not hold off the challenge of the Paralympic champions.

France are next up tonight, followed by Japan tomorrow, with successive 
victories certain to secure semi-final status.

Brown said: ‘The States are number one
 in the world, so it was never going to be easy.

'We had the bounce of 
the ball sometimes, and other times it went against us. That crowd was 
something else.

'You have to draw from the crowd and find that extra 
percentage with your performance.’

Kylie Grimes, 24, the only female 
player in Britain’s ranks – and one of only two in the tournament – 
added: ‘We came out really strong.’

Tickets
 for the London 2012 Games sold out, with the ParalympicsGB chef de 
mission Craig Hunter describing it as a 'tough, fast game played with no
 fear and plenty of clashes'.

So many clashes, in fact, that there is a team of welders on standby at the sidelines, ready to repair players' wheelchairs.

The 11-strong ParalympicsGB squad is a
 young team, with only three players having taken part in both Beijing 
and Athens and are hoping for their first Paralympics medal.

Before today's game, Captain Steve Brown said the team 
strongly wants to win a medal, in the strategic game he describes as 
being similar to chess.

But he stressed: 'There is no added pressure. I 
am not thinking about the history.'

He added that it was a 'buzz' to play in front of sell-out crowds.

After today's opener, Britain play 
France tomorrow evening, then Japan on Friday.

Both semi-finals are on 
Saturday, with the final one of the Games' last events next Sunday 
afternoon.

The game was invented in the 1970s by athletes with quadriplegia wanting an alternative sport to wheelchair basketball, but it was not until 1989 that the first international tournament was held.

Great Britain was among the three teams taking part in Toronto, Canada.

As if being the only female member of the British wheelchair rugby team was not enough to make Kylie Grimes, above, stand out, she has also had a Union Jack shaved into the side of her bright red hair.

The
 24-year-old put in an impressive performance when the ParalympicsGB 
team faced the USA, ranked number one in the world, in the opening match
 of the competition this afternoon.

She is only the second woman to play with the British team at Paralympic level.

Grimes,
 who lives in Farnham, Surrey, took up the sport two years ago after an 
accident which left her paralysed from the chest down.

She
 lost a £6million damages claim at the High Court last year over the 
injury, which happened when she hit her head on the bottom of a swimming
 pool as a teenager in 2006.

Grimes
 knew that she 'wanted to continue playing sport and as soon as she saw 
her first game of wheelchair rugby, she says she knew it was the sport 
for her', according to the British Paralympic Association.

It first appeared at a Paralympic 
Games in 1996 as a demonstration sport, making the Sydney

Games the 
first time it was given full medal status.

Wheelchair rugby is played indoors on a
 basketball court, with mixed teams of four players who use a white 
ball, similar to a volleyball.

To
 score a goal, an athlete has to pass the opposing team's goal line 
while in firm control of the ball, with two wheels of their chair 
crossing the line.

The ball has to be passed or dribbled 
every 10 seconds and is passed to the other side if that does not 
happen.

There are four eight-minute quarters to each game.

While
 there is contact between the chairs, penalties are incurred if physical
 contact is made with an opponent or if an opponent's chair is hit 
behind the rear wheel.

Athletes are classified with a points system, on a scale from 0.5 to 3.5.

Their team of four athletes on court 
at any one time cannot exceed a total of 8.0 points in total unless 
there is a woman in the team, in which case they are allowed an extra 
0.5 points.

Those with the 
highest level of impairment are classified as 0.5 players and along with
 the 1.0 players, can not easily pick up or pass the ball, making them 
more suited to being blockers.

Those
 with a rating of 3.0 or 3.5 have a high degree of strength and 
stability as well as higher functionality in their upper limbs.

Currently, the sport is dominated by the US and Canadian teams.

Murderball was given its name by the devil-may-care quadriplegics who invented the game during the late Seventies.

It was also the title of a 2005 documentary starring U.S. player Mark Zurpan, about teams competing at the previous year’s Paralympics in Athens.

The sport - otherwise known as wheelchair rugby - was invented by a group of Canadians who met in rehab and whose disabilities were so severe that they couldn’t participate in wheelchair basketball.

Searching for an outlet for their machismo, they found slamming into one another like wheel-propelled warriors exhilaratingly therapeutic.

Sparks visibly fly as aluminium wheels are deliberately jammed by nasty devices (called ‘spikes’) attached to the front of some chairs.

Attackers attempt to force the ball over the goal-line with the aid of battering rams, with the barging is so ferocious that players are frequently thrown from their seats, sometimes breaking fingers and arms.

The sport soon became popular across the border in the U.S., and in the Eighties reached Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Britain.

It has rapidly evolved, at the elite level, into a strategic game likened to fast-moving human chess.

Though the British HQ is at Twickenham and the aim is to get the ball — round not oval — across a goal-line, it bears little resemblance to rugby.
