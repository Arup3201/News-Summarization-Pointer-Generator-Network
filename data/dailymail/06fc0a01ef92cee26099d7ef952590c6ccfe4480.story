Topshop has asked the Court of Appeal to intervene after a row over the T-shirt (pictured) with  Rihanna led to a permanent ban on it being sold in stores

High Street chain Topshop has launched an appeal case in a bid to overturn a ruling which stopped it from selling T-shirts with a picture of pop star Rihanna on the front.

Topshop, which is owned by Sir Philip Green, has asked the Court of Appeal to intervene after a row over the T-shirt with the 26-year-old singer led to a permanent ban on it being sold in stores.

Last year, a High Court judge concluded that Rihanna's fans might be deceived into thinking she had endorsed the 'tank' sleeveless T-shirt sold by Topshop and ruled it must be pulled from shelves.

However, Topshop – which is owned by the Arcadia Group – has now asked the appeal judges at the Royal Courts of Justice in London to review the case after believing the previous judge had erred in his approach to the law on celebrity merchandising.

During the case last year, Rihanna's lawyers said the image used on the T-shirt was from an unauthorised photograph taken while she was filming a video in Northern Ireland for one of her singles in 2011.

At the time, Mr Justice Birss ruled that Topshop's sale of the top without her approval was, in the circumstances, 'passing off'.

Today, Topshop lawyers presented the appeal judges - Lord Justice Richards, Lord Justice Kitchin and Lord Justice Underhill – with a rack of the T-shirts as the two-day case got underway.

Geoffrey Hobbs QC, appearing for Topshop, said the starting point in the appeal case was that the court was dealing with a 'decorated T-shirt' in a tradition of the merchandising of star images over the decades, including those of Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix and Prince.

Mr Hobbs argued that Rihanna was in reality wrongly using the law on passing off to claim that 'only a celebrity may ever market his or her own character'.

Rihanna has various lucrative endorsement deals with retailers including Topshop's high-street rival River Island.

Mr Hobbs contended that the public had no expectation that clothes bearing an image were authorised by people shown in that image.

He challenged Mr Justice Birss's ruling that, although celebrities had no general right to control the reproduction of their image, Topshop's use of Rihanna's image did amount to passing off.

The judge had observed it was damaging to the star's 'goodwill' and ultimately represented a loss of control over her reputation in the 'fashion sphere'.

Mike Gardner, a partner and head of intellectual property and commercial at Wedlake Bell LLP, commented on the case: 'Unlike in some other countries, in the UK celebrities have no legal right, as such, to control the use that is made of their image.

'But if a product is marketed in such a way as to suggest, incorrectly, that they have endorsed or approved it, then this can amount to illegal passing off.

'Although each case is different, if Topshop fails to overturn the ruling, this may discourage other retailers from selling similar items in the future and may lead other celebrities to take a tougher line in policing their rights.

'But if Topshop is successful, celebrities and their management teams may have to think more about how they can best protect their branding in countries like the UK which do not recognise image rights.'

The case continues.
