Newcastle midfielder Jonas Gutierrez has thanked the club's fans for their 'amazing support' during his battle with cancer, revealing it gave him the strength to beat the disease.

Gutierrez was diagnosed with testicular cancer last year but was discharged from hospital in November and has since returned to training with Newcastle.

And the former Mallorca man insisted the club's supporters had played their part in his journey to good health.

Gutierrez is a firm fans' favourite on Tyneside and Alan Pardew is expecting his return to be emotional

'I had to say thank you because they (fans) gave me the power and the strength to go through the cancer. Gutierrez told nufcTV.

'I think when you do the right things in your life, that things come back to you.

'It was amazing to get that kind of support (Newcastle fans clapping in 18th minute) and singing my song, I'm really proud and thank you.' 

But it wasn't just the fans that helped Gutierrez through his ordeal. The Argentine midfielder admitted his team-mates had played a big role and reserved special praise for club captain Fabricio Coloccini.

He said: 'Colo is like part of my family and he gave me a lot of support.

'It is something really special what we have with our relationship and our families.'

The former Mallorca man has not made an appearance for Newcastle since 2013

The 31-year-old's last game was in back in April, but rather than thinking about the time he lost Gutierrez is just delighted to be back among his fellow players.

'I'm really happy to be back, it was a hard year for me but now, more importantly I'm involved again with the team and training. I'm really enjoying all the days back in Newcastle.

'I was only thinking to beat the cancer always looking forward.

'I never got frustrated or asked why has this happened to me?

'I think life is life and it is not easy for anybody, it was like a test that life put to me.'
