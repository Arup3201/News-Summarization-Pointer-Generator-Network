It's nearing 'crunch time' for Greece and the eurozone and failure to reach a deal over the country's bailout would be 'very severe for economic and financial stability', according to Britain's Finance Minister George Osborne.

However, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras today signalled little intention of backing down from Greece's clash with its euro zone partners, despite a looming financial crisis. 

Tsipras said his government would not succumb to 'blackmail' and would instead quickly start voting in new laws to reverse bailout reforms.

Ignoring calls from across Europe to compromise on a plan to extend Greece's bailout programme, he said he was confident a deal on the country's future would ultimately be found but that Athens would not climb down from its pre-election pledges.

'We are not in a hurry and we will not compromise,' Tsipras told his party's lawmakers in parliament.

'We are working hard for an honest and mutually beneficial deal, a deal without austerity, without the bailout which has destroyed Greece in recent years, a deal without the toxic presence of the (bailout inspecting) troika.'

Tsipras said his parliament would start voting in bills this week to implement campaign pledges of protecting primary residences from foreclosures and banning the sale of mortgage loans to distressed funds.

A bill reversing labour reform and restoring collective bargaining agreements scrapped by European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders would soon be presented alongside another one to deal with the 'humanitarian crisis' in Greece, he said.  

The current bailout runs out in two weeks, and the EU had originally said Greece would have to demand an extension to the loan by yesterday.

But, following the collapse of a meeting in Brussels, European officials gave the newly elected radical Left government in Athens another three days, with the possibility of another meeting on Friday.

Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the Eurogroup of 19 countries using the common currency, stuck to his guns, however, saying Athens must seek an extension.

'It's really up to the Greeks,' he said. 'We cannot make them or ask them. We stand ready to work with them, also (over) the next couple of days.'

If no deal is reached, Greece will be unable to service its debt and could run out of cash, meaning it would not be able to pay its civil servants or fund pensions.

Economists have warned that this could see the country being forced out of the euro, which would spark a crisis in the eurozone and have damaging knock-on effects for the UK economy.

Osborne said 'we're reaching crunch time for Greece and the eurozone' and warned failure to reach a deal would be 'very severe for economic and financial stability'.

Echoing the alarm EU officials have voiced about the negotiating tactics of the left-wing government Greeks elected last month to end hated austerity programmes, Osborne added: 'What Britain really needs to see is competence, not chaos.'

Greece's Left-wing Syriza government wants the country's bailout to be restructured, with an end to many austerity demands.

The International Monetary Fund and European Union say there should be no change to the terms of the current £178billion loan.

Despite all the tough talk and ultimatums, Greece and its creditors in the eurozone are still expected to cobble together some sort of deal that will allow the country to remain a member of the euro currency.

'If Greece were to leave the euro, the financial chaos that would follow could also spell the end of the Syriza-led government,' said Jane Foley, analyst at Rabobank International.

'For this reason it remains our central view that an eleventh hour compromise between Greece and its creditors is still likely.'

The current bailout expires on February 28. Any new agreement would have to be approved by national governments, so time is running out to reach a compromise.

While the stock index in Athens declined only modestly Tuesday, Greece's government borrowing rates are rising steadily - a sign investors are more wary of a potential bankruptcy.   

Economists at Commerzbank estimate that falling out of the currency union would see Greece's economy shrink another 10 per cent. 

That is on top of the 25 per cent it has already plunged since the crisis, putting it through a downturn similar to the U.S. Depression of the 1930s.

A new currency would fall sharply in value, meaning painfully higher prices for imports like medicine and gas. Companies' debts in euros would swell, forcing many into bankruptcy.

In the rest of the eurozone, taxpayers would be handed big losses on bailout loans their governments gave Greece.

The eurozone bailout fund - a pot of money backed by taxpayers - is owed €142billion, individual countries are owed €53billion, and the European Central Bank €20billion. The Greek central bank owes another €50billion to eurozone central banks.
