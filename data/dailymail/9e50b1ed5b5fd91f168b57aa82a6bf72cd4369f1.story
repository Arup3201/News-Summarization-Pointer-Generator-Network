Depay has already made 10 appearances for Holland. He impressed at the World Cup in Brazil with a string of impressive displays.

'Depay has the potential to become Netherlands' best player,' Hiddink told NOS.

Potential: Memphis Depay has already shown in his 10 appearances for Holland that he has star quality

Belief: Guus Hiddink believes Depay could become Holland's best player if he keeps applying himself

Impressive: Depay linked up with Arjen Robben at the World Cup as Van Gaal's Holland played well

Targeted: Man United have been keeping tabs on Depay who is celebrating a PSV goal with Luuk De Jong

'I've noticed that he has even more potential than I first thought now that I'm working with him.

'He still has plenty of room for improvement. I first thought that it was hard to approach him, but I was wrong. He is incredibly interested and keen to learn.

'I can't say yet whether he will start against Czech Republic, but that's definitely an option.'
