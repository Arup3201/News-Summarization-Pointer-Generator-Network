Miranda Kerr and Hilaria Baldwin may credit a bit of yoga with making their bodies more flexible and supple but a young woman from Britain, who can contort her body into all sorts of shapes, makes the stars look as stiff as nails.

Pixie Le Knot, real name Jennifer Keith, is one of the most flexible contortionists in the UK.

The 26-year-old from Sheffield performs the most extreme acrobatic acts at venues all over the world and has appeared in many commercials, music videos and publicity stunts.

Wow! Pixie Le Knot, who performs in movies, adverts and music videos, is one of Britian's best contortionists

Speaking about her skill, she said: ‘I was always the most flexible child in the class and knew I had a gift as soon as I took up dance and gymnastics as a kid.

'It’s fun being able to do something other people can’t. But I really don’t know where I got the natural ability from - all my relatives are doctors.’

Now THAT's supple! Speaking about her skill, she said: 'I was always the most flexible child in the class and knew I had a gift as soon as I took up dance and gymnastics as a kid'

She makes it look easy! Pixie, 26, from London, can pull her body into all sorts of bizarre shapes

Flexible: She trains for long hours to get her body into shape for a performance and needs around half an hour to warm up before a big event

Ms Le Knot, who appeared in HBO’s Game Of Thrones as Kayla, spends several hours every day training her body to cope with the physical demands of contortion and she needs at least thirty minutes to warm up prior to a performance.

She then performs up to five live shows a week and her most famous appearances include a performance at P Diddy's 34th birthday party, Will.I.am’s camera launch party, The Brit Awards 2014 After party and Mark Ronson’s Belle Epoch Immortal IntentBurly Q, Sheffield.

She also appeared in Paramount’s horror movie The Devil Inside, The World’s Greatest Bodyshockers on E4 and is set to appear in new horror thriller It Never Sleeps, to be released this year.

As well as her on-screen and on-stage performances, she has also served as Davina McCall’s contortion stunt double on Channel 4′s Mash-up 2 and was Alesha Dixon’s contortion stunt double for a Britain’s Got Talent TV commercial.

Pixie, who became a contortionist after a chance meeting with a circus performer five years ago, added: 'People do say I sit in positions which look really uncomfortable but I do hate it when people ask me if I can get into a box. There’s so much more to the art form than that.’

Pixie runs weekly group contortion classes, and is available for private contortion training classes for all ages and abilities.
