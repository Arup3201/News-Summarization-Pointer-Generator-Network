Gus Poyet's is close to completing a move for Chelsea full-back Patrick van Aanholt.

It is understood the Black Cats are hopeful of striking a deal for the 23-year-old Holland international within the next 24 hours after becoming increasingly frustrated in their pursuit of Fiorentina defender Marcos Alonso.

Indeed, club officials were hopeful of 
including Van Aanholt in the party heading off for a pre-season training
 camp in Portugal on Friday.

The Dutchman, who came through the ranks at Chelsea while sporting director Lee Congerton was at the club, has spent the last two-and-a-half seasons on loan at Vitesse Arnhem.

He has made only nine senior appearances for the Blues and has been sent out on loan to five different clubs, including a month at Newcastle in 2010.

However, he has indicated that he feels his future lies away from Stamford Bridge, and Sunderland are keen to take advantage of his hunger for regular first-team football.

Van Aanholt's capture does not necessarily preclude a continuation of efforts to land Alonso, who proved a key player on loan last season, but it would provide a welcome boost for Poyet, whose hopes of sealing a permanent deal for Fabio Borini are also yet to be realised.
