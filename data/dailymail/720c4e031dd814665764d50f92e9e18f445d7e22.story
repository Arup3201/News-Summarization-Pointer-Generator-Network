Forecasters have this evening issued severe weather warnings for large parts of the UK with up to eight inches of snow expected this weekend.

Temperatures are set to plummet to -5C as rain, sleet and snow batters the UK. Freezing temperatures will lead to treacherous conditions on the roads and forecasters have also warned that vulnerable people should be looked after.

Some parts of the UK have seen snow today and it is also expected to return tomorrow. However the worst of the
weather is expected on Sunday.

Up to eight inches of 'disruptive' snow is expected in some parts of the country including northern England, the Midlands and Wales. But forecasters are unable to say where the worst affected areas will be.

Sporty: With large amounts of snow forecast for this weekend, skiers today made the most of the weather at this slope in Cumbria

Cold: With freezing conditions set to arrive across much of the UK this weekend, skiers were out in force today

Risk: Forecasters have warned that vulnerable people could be at risk over the weekend because of the cold conditions. However, the snowy weather wasn't a concern for this snowboarder

Dave Britton, a Met Office forecaster, said: 'It is quite an uncertain picture for the weekend but we know the worst of the weather will be on Sunday.Â 

'There will be snow across parts of the Midlands, Wales, Northern Ireland, the north east of England and parts of Scotland. Exactly how much there will be and how heavy is quite uncertain

'There could be possible disruption to travel as we head from Sunday into Monday. People should be aware that they might need to change plans or think about changing plans as the weekend progresses.'

The Met Office has issued warnings this morning 
for ice across southwest England and the West Midlands and warns of a 
risk of icy conditions on untreated surfaces across the rest of the UK.

Forecasters say snow is possible today on higher ground but also on low levels in East Anglia.

Snow is also expected tomorrow across 
central and east England.

Weather
experts say 'heavy' snow will fall across Scotland and eastern parts of
England, especially the north-east, throughout Sunday afternoon and 
night.

Warnings: Temperatures are expected to drop dramatically to -5C into the start of next week. This snow plough cuts a lonely figure as it drives along a snow lined road in Cumbria

Worse to come: Although some parts of the UK will see snow today and tomorrow, the worst of the weather is expected on Sunday

Gareth Harvey, a 
forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: 'The next few days will only see a few light snow 
flurries affecting mountains in Wales and Scotland and the Pennines, in 
northern England, while temperatures will stay cold.

'The weather will change on Sunday when a front coming in from the west meets cold air.

'It
looks like there will first be some rain before it progresses to snow 
over large parts of Scotland and the eastern half of England, 
particularly the north-east.

'There could be some significant, heavy amounts.'

Despite temperatures still hovering 
around freezing, snowdrops were seen today - which usually indicate 
first signs that Spring is just around the corner.

The stately home near Newbury, 
Berkshire, has been in James Puxley's family for four hundred years and 
his wife Deborah said this year's snowdrops are the best or many.

'The snow in January is just what they like,' said Mrs Puxley.

'They were all just growing 
underneath and because they was such a thick layer of snow they are all 
particularly tall this year.'

Frosty: Dog walkers enjoy the wintry conditions in the woods of the Titsey estate on the North Downs, Surrey

Hazardous: Forecasters have warned of dangerous driving conditions with ice and snow on the roads this weekend. This was the scene along the North Downs on the Kent /Surrey border this morning

Tricky: Snow and ice made driving conditions extremely difficult this morning

'They are a little bit early as we were shut because of snow early in February the last couple of years.

'But they are looking tall and fabulous.'

Temperatures
across most places were below freezing on Wednesday night with strong 
winds of up to 70mph also battering parts of Britain.

The east coast of England saw some of the worst conditions with up to 3cm of snow recorded in East Anglia.

Drivers in the region were warned about dangerous, icy conditions on the roads by the police and Highways Agency.

Following
a series of crashes across the county yesterday morning, Norfolk Police 
tweeted: 'Please take extra care on Norfolk roads this morning, the 
temperatures overnight have caused hazardous driving conditions.'

Suffolk Police also warned drivers of 'black ice' on the county's roads and advised drivers to take extra care.

Icy
conditions on Suffolk's roads led to a car carrying four elderly people
coming off the road and landing upside down in a ditch.

Fire crews had to free the group from the vehicle following the accident in the town of Eye, near Ipswich.

Despite
the cold conditions, daffodil farmers are heralding the start of spring
as the first flowering crops of the new year are being readied for 
harvest.

Against a recent 
backdrop of torrential downpours, snowfall and plunging temperatures, 
growers say winter's grip on the British weather is relenting, giving 
the common daffodil an opportunity to thrive.

Some farmers began their harvests with 2013 barely a week old, though others are now seeing their fields turn a golden yellow.

And it was all thanks to a period of milder, wet weather between Christmas and new year.

Mark
van der Vliet, one of five directors at Cornwall-based New Generation 
Daffodils Ltd, said he was pleased with this season's offerings.

'To me, the humble daffodil marks the start of the spring, it's a sign that winter is on the way out,' he said.

'They're
known as a bit of a "cheap and cheerful" flower, and it really does 
bring a smile to my face to walk into the fields and see the daffs ready
for harvesting.'

The 53-year-old is the second 
generation of daffodil grower in his family, supplying to customers 
across the UK and internationally from his firm's 400 acres of fields in
west Cornwall.

Mr van der Vliet said: 'The profit margins squeeze every year, but this year has been quite good so far.

'The conditions have been good to us, so we have seen a lovely daffodil flowering.'

It comes a fortnight after blizzards brought days of disruption to schools, airports and traffic networks.
