Ms Wells has allegedly left dozens of women without wedding dresses for their big day.

The women have used social media to organise surveillance of the store in order to recoup their losses which total in the thousands of dollars.

Mother-of-three Diana Quilty paid Ms Wells over $3000 in August for ten dresses to start her own wedding dress business online, but has not received any dresses.

'She had all the right words to say, she sounded very confident. So I handed over my money,' she said. 

After contacting the manufacturer she was informed that the order was never placed, reported the Gold Coast Bulletin.

'It’s been heartbreaking,' Mrs Quilty said.

'We worked so hard to save that money to start a new business and now it’s just gone.'

Lisa Beerstreet paid Ms Wells $1500 to help plan her wedding in three weeks time, but has received no help and claims the dressmaker ruined her dress.

Ms Wells told customers she was moving interstate, and has vanished along with money paid to her by other jilted customers.

'I'm crushed,' she told A Current Affair.

'It changes the way you feel about your special day.' 

The business claimed on advertisement for the store that it had 'everything for you to make sure you have the most wonderful day of your life without stress and worry'.

Former employees of All Occasions have joined the stake out, and are owed between $800 and $1000 in wages for work.

Beth Ainsworth worked as Ms Well's event assistant for five months and said that she realised something was wrong when frustrated customers began calling the store after not receiving goods or services they had paid for.

'I’ve been chasing her for weeks,' said Ms Ainsworth.

'You can’t just leave people in ruins days before their wedding.' 

Ms Wells will face court on November 19 on the charge of stealing.
