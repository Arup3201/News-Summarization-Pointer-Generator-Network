Shaker Aamer has been detained at the US detention facility without trial or charge since 2002

Amnesty International today launches a major petition demanding the release of Shaker Aamer.

The global human rights organisation said the ‘terrible farce’ of his continued detention had ‘gone on too long’.

The petition launch coincides with the 13th anniversary of the opening of the infamous US detention facility in Cuba on Sunday.

In almost all that time, Mr Aamer, who has resident status in Britain and whose British wife and children live in South London, has been held in Guantanamo without charge.

The new petition calls for Mr Aamer to be released and returned to the UK ‘without delay’, and for an immediate investigation into his allegations of torture and other ill-treatment.

Supporters of the campaign for his release have called on David Cameron to raise the issue with President Obama in talks expected later this month. 

Downing Street say the case has been raised at the ‘highest levels’.

Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said: ‘Since the publication of the report into CIA torture there’s been renewed interest in Shaker’s plight, and not before time. 

‘It’s been 13 shameful years since the US authorities took those first orange-jumpsuited detainees to Guantánamo, and Shaker’s been there almost for the duration.

‘We need the UK government to definitively establish what the blockage over his release actually is - this terrible farce has gone on long enough.

‘Messrs Cameron and Obama need to put the relevant officials in a room and sort out the means of releasing Shaker without delay - in days, not weeks.’

Recent weeks have seen a flurry of releases from Guantanamo, raising new hope that Mr Aamer’s detention may soon come to an end. Five former detainees were sent to Kazakhstan at the end of December.

President Obama pledged to close Guantanamo when he first campaigned for election to the White House, and there is hope it may yet be emptied by the time he leaves the White House at the end of next year.

Mr Aamer has twice been cleared for transfer from the camp, the first time in 2007 and again two years later. His health has deteriorated and last year he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

The 46-year-old father of four was first transferred to Guantanamo on 14 February 2002, after he was detained in Afghanistan and transferred to the custody of the American government.

They say he is a terrorist who was a close ally of Osama bin Laden, a claim he strenuously denies.

Joanne MacInnes, campaign director of ‘We Stand With Shaker’ said: ‘We are delighted that Amnesty has launched this timely petition for Shaker Aamer, which boosts the growing campaign momentum and marks the 13th year of the opening of Guantanamo prison.

‘Shaker is one of seven non-Yemen detainees cleared for release and so doesn't need to be found a host country - and therefore should be amongst the first and easiest to bring home.

‘If Shaker is indeed David Cameron's top priority, as we are so often told, then I see no reason why Shaker shouldn't be on the next plane home.

‘If that's not happening can we please be offered an explanation as to why he isn't amongst the very next releases.

‘Shaker's family is owed an explanation as to why they cannot get him home. The British Government has a non-negotiable responsibility to secure the return of Mr Aamer, given his status as a legal British resident.’

The petition can be found on the Amnesty International website.
