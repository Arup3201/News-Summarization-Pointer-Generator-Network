A man was found hidden away Friday inside a washing machine after he illegally crossed the Mexican border into the U.S. 

Along with four others, who were stowed inside a cardboard box, the man was detained by U.S. border patrol in Falfurrias, Texas.

The group was traveling in the back of a U-Haul. Also detained were the man behind the wheel and his female passenger.

According to KGBT, the immigrants were offered medical attention, which they declined.

Homeland security is investigating.

Meanwhile, high-ranking U.S. Senate Democrats last week called on the Obama administration to reverse its new policy of detaining Central American immigrant families, warning it could be damaging to the young children being housed in the facilities.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont and eight other Democrats wrote Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Thursday to complain about the detentions.

'Mothers and their children who have fled violence in their home countries should not be treated like criminals,' wrote the senators, who also included Democratic leadership members Dick Durbin of Illinois, Charles Schumer of New York and Patty Murray of Washington state.

The detention policy, which was initiated this past summer as tens of thousands of families and unaccompanied children rushed to the U.S. border, is part of a broader White House strategy of deterring another influx next year.

Many of the migrants are fleeing El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where gang violence, drugs and human trafficking are rampant.

In 2009, the United States stopped housing newly arrived immigrant families in a troubled Texas detention facility. Instead, the Obama administration made less restrictive measures, such as ankle bracelets, telephone interviews and other monitoring programs the centerpiece of its policy for keeping tabs on migrants awaiting court determinations on their status.

But that changed a few months ago, as President Barack Obama was under intense pressure from Republicans in Congress to stop the record numbers of children and families seeking refuge in the United States and arriving without visas.

He responded by directing the opening of family detention centers, expediting immigration court cases, refusing bond for many of the migrants and working with Mexico to secure borders.

By year's end, the federal government will have the capacity to detain about 4,000 mothers and children at any one time in centers located in New Mexico, Texas and Pennsylvania.
