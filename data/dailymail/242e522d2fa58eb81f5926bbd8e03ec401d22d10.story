The Middleton sisters are both known for their glossy long locks. So it came as some surprise today to see that Pippa has gone for a radical chop.

The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister, 30, debuted her 'lob' (a long bob) at the Waitrose summer party last night.

She wore her hair loose and unstyled, lending her emerald green lace dress a relaxed feel.

New look: Already the haircut is winning the seal of approval of top beauty experts

And already the haircut is winning the seal of approval of top style experts.

Celebrity make-up artist Rachel Wood, who works with Mariah Carey, Vanessa Hudgens and Louise Roe, was full of praise for the socialite's new look.

'I always think a good few inches chop makes hair look thicker and healthier,' she told MailOnline. 'Pippa's long locks were starting to look stringy so I like the new do! This cut gives more structure to her 
cheekbones which looked a lot rounder with lengthier locks and I'm 
loving the extra highlight she added to her make-up to accentuate them.

Daily Mail columnist Liz Jones is also a fan of Pippa's haircut, calling it 'edgy' and 'more modern'.

'I love her haircut!' she said. 'It is edgy, it makes her look younger, and it means she has stepped out of Kate's rather "Dallas" hair do shadow.

'The big hair look is very old 
fashioned, and safe, and tends to drag down the face under its weight. 
Unlike Kate's hair, which is layered, and has subtle highlights, Pippa's
 cut is all one length, and all one colour, which is far more modern.'

Pippa's previous hairstyle only 
heightened the resemblance between her and her famous sister, so it may 
be the case that this new look is an attempt to carve a separate 
identity.

Indeed, Jones added: 'This new shorter style is a show of confidence, too. It shows she is going to plough her own furrow.'

She would not be 
the first to go for such a hairstyle though. Nicole Richie and Emma 
Stone both sport similar looks to great effect. And Jerry Hall went for a
 'lob' in February, finally parting ways with her famous mane.

But, Wood suggests, Pippa could benefit from a few layers as well as some new styling products to give the cut shape.

'I
 do think she could benefit with a few shaggy layers in the front like 
Nicole Richie's, as Pippa has a long forehead and this style draws focus
 to it,' she explained. 'Or maybe adding a little more texture with some
 Bumble & Bumble Surf Spray or some volume using a product like 
Phyto's new root lift spray.'

And celebrity hair stylist John Barrett, of the John Barrett salon at Bergdorf Goodman, believes Pippa should take the cut even shorter, and try a fringe too.

Happy: Pippa seemed in great spirits with her new hair

'I would be more adventurous and take her hair a little shorter at the back and do wispy bangs,' he told MailOnline.

'This will make her look more current and will give her more options. Right now, Pippa's style is at an in-between stage and I believe that it is crucial that she has a true hairstyle that is effortless, sensual and casual.'

Pippa is a regular columnist for The Spectator and Vanity Fair, and published an entertaining book, Celebrate, in 2012. She has been dating investment banker Nico Jackson, 36, for 18 months.
