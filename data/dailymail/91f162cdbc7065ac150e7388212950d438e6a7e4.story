In what looks to be a horror movie come to life, a terrifying video shows as a hospital patient tears through a hospital attacking nurses with a large metal pole. 

Charles Emmett Logan Sr., of St. Paul, Minnesota, attacked multiple nurses over the weekend at St. John's Hospital, running through the nurse's station and hallways of the building as he violently swung a large metal pole at every person he came across.

In the end, four nurses suffered severe injuries, including a collapsed lung and broken wrist.

Horrific attack: Charles Emmett Logan (circled in red) attacked multiple nurses with a metal pole in the early morning hours on Saturday

Horror movie: The man had been a patient at St. John's Hospital in Minnesota

Unknown cause: It is not certain why he attacked, though medical workers did reveal he suffered from paranoia

The nurses injured in the attack were identified as 40-year-old Leslie Lichey; 22-year-old Brooke Scott; 32-year-old Nicole Eenisse; and 30-year-old Kelly Roberto.

It is not known what caused the attack, though Logan, 68, did suffer from paranoia according to medical workers.

Making the entire incident even more bizarre, police were unable to subdue Logan when they located him three blocks away, and, according to KARE, three officers were needed to take him down after the probes of their Taser failed to attach and take him down.

Then, when they finally managed to get handcuffs on him, he suddenly died. 

Scary moments: The man ran through the nurse's station and hallway hitting everyone he came across

Victims: Four nurses suffered serious injuries as a result of the attack

Badly hurt: The worst was one woman who suffered a collapsed lung

An autopsy has been scheduled. 

'Those familiar with Mr. Logan described a very recent change in which he became confused and periodically delusional,' said the police department in a release. 

'Nothing in Mr. Logan's past or more recent history indicates a tendency toward violence.' 

One officer on the scene reports that Shane Perry, Logan's lawyer, said the incident occurred after a family disagreement earlier in the day.

It is uncertain what exactly happened, but according to The Star Tribune, 'there was a difference of opinion between Logan and his wife and daughter about his treatment — so much so that Perry sought an emergency order from a Ramsey County judge to protect his client.'

Logan told Perry at the hospital that he wanted to sell his house and give half of the money to his grandchildren, which he believes indicated that he wanted a separation from his wife.

The family then caused a scene until Perry left the hospital. 

Running for their lives: Nurses could be seen fleeing from their station into the hallway

On the move: Logan was eventually found by police three blocks away from the hospital

Tragic end: Logan died shortly after police handcuffed him, this after he was hit with a Taser and wrestled to the ground

Officers were called roughly five hours later, shortly before 2 am when there was a report a man with episodes of confusion had suddenly attacked the nurses at the hospital. 

The actual video footage tracks Logan as he goes from nurse's station to the hallway, hitting anyone he can and not seeming to focus on any specific worker. 

The nurses are caught completely off guard when he first appears, rushing to the door as he lands blow after blow. 

'It is fortunate that hospital personnel were not more seriously injured in the unprovoked attack,' said Maplewood Police Chief Paul Schnell. 

'While what prompted the attack may never be known, we await completion of the Ramsey County Medical Examiner's inquiry, which we hope might answer questions about Mr. Logan's status for the sake of his family and all those involved in this incident.'
