Airport officials are looking into why a flight information panel fell on a family and killed a 10-year-old boy and critically injured his mother and took down an identical sign on Saturday.

Heather Bresette 
and her three sons, between 6 and 10-years-old, were standing beneath a 
flight information sign at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International 
Airport when it fell without warning.

Luke Bresette, 10, was pronounced dead at Children's of Alabama, said Deputy Coroner Derrick Perryma. Heather Bresette, who remained conscious throughout the terrible ordeal, was taken to UAB Hospital with two broken ankles and a fractured pelvis.

The airport completed the first phase of a more than $201 million modernization effort and opened newly renovated concourses about a week ago.

Mayor William Bell said he talked with the boy's father - who was not injured - and is pressing officials to explain how the sign toppled over.

'I cannot come close to understanding his heartache. But I will get answers. I'm calling on the airport authority to thoroughly investigate this horrible incident. I want a full report on my desk as quickly as possible,' he told AL.com.

Airport officials met Saturday, but would not elaborate on other safety measures being taken.

'President and CEO Al Denson and the staff are continuing to work with officials to investigate. This includes discussions with contractors and subcontractors responsible for the modernization,' Chairwoman of the Airport Authority Board of Directors Gaynell Hendricks said in a statement.

The contractors and subcontractors were not identified.

Airport spokeswoman Toni Herrera-Bast said officials aren't sure how the sign fell. The airport continued operating while rescue workers tended to the family.

Heather underwent surgery last night, but
surgeons decided her body wasn't strong enough for all the work they 
needed to be done and so she is due to have additional surgery on 
Sunday. 

The two younger boys Sam, 8, and Tyler, 5, are being treated at Children's of Alabama where their condition is described as 'fair'. Sam has a broken leg 
and nose, while Tyler has a concussion. 

Family tragedy: Luke Bresette, 10, was killed after an airport sign collapsed on him, his mom and two younger brothers

Luke Bresette, 10, second from right was the third eldest of five children

The terrible incident occurred at 
about 1:30 p.m. on Friday as the family were returning to Overland Park,
Kansas after spending a week in Destin for Spring Break.

Husband and 
father Ryan Bresette wasn't injured, nor was older sister Anna and 
another brother, Joe.

Luke was the third of the five children and was in
the fifth grade at St. Thomas More School, Kansas City.

His uncle Alex Bresette has described his nephew as some who was full of love and life.

‘He was a beautiful boy,' he told AL.com. ‘He was great in school. He was bright and inquisitive.’

Luke enjoyed playing 
baseball, football, basketball and sang in the choir. He was also an 
avid fan of Notre Dame football and the Kansas Jayhawks.

'You know how some kids get too old to hug you anymore?' Alex Bresette said. 'Not Luke, he always hugged.'

Witnesses said the family was walking by the giant sign when it came crashing down on top of them. It took six men to lift it off the family and later about a dozen men held it up while rescue workers worked on the family.

The sign weighing between 300 and 400
pounds took eight to 10 bystanders to lift it off the family said 
Birmingham Fire and Rescue Battalion Chief Donald Jones.

First responders: The massive flight information board is seen propped up against the wall by rescue workers

Scene: Witnesses reported a loud crash with people screaming in the area before eight to 10 people hurried to lift the massive board off of the family

Rushed away: One of the injured is seen being taken away from the scene on a stretcher

Immediate care: One of the young is taken away from the scene by emergency personnel

The children's father is said to have been checking them in at the nearby Southwest desk, according to a witness, when the horrific incident occurred around 1.30pm.

‘The 300-plus pound sign toppled and hit the family without warning,’ witness to the scene Albert Osorio told AL.com.

‘The whole thing flipped down on those kids. It took all of us here to stand it back up. Everybody started screaming.’

Mr Osorio said that from what he saw, the sign appeared to have been attached to the wall 'only with liquid nails,' a type of caulking adhesive, he told the website.

Airport spokesperson Toni Herrera-Bast told WBRC an investigation is underway into why the board fell with the cause not immediately known.

Herrera-Bast said she wasn't sure how the board was attached to the wall.

Closed off: Two workers are seen cleaning in a closed off section of the terminal where the large sign, said to be between 300-400 pounds, fell off the wall

Safety measures: As a precautionary measure barricades have been placed around the airport's other flight status boards, the fallen one is seen here

A witness Tweeting a photo near the scene described it as 'blood everywhere and a mom screaming.'

The terminal has since closed with no word yet on when it will reopen.

Barricades have since been positioned around the airport's other flight status boards as a precautionary measure.

Birmingham's mayor William Bell released a statement immediately after the incident promising his full support in the investigation.

Emergency rescue: Fire trucks rushed to the terminal at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport

Crews: Emergency crews rushed to the scene just after 1.30pm on Friday

'I have offered our full support to the Airport Authority as they 
investigate what has occurred this afternoon. I have asked our public 
safety staff to assist this family in their time of need in any way 
possible as they grapple with what has happened,' the statement read.

The board was in a new terminal of the airport which opened last week following a $201 million modernization effort.

Flights were said to have not been disrupted going into or out of the airport due to the incident on Friday.
