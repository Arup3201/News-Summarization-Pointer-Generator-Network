A young girl who was raped by two boys she was playing Xbox with was subjected to a tirade on online abuse accusing her of 'asking for it' and 'lying' about the assaults.

The girl, from Chepstow, south Wales, was just ten when she was raped by boys aged 12 and 13 as they played the Minecraft computer game together.

The boys, who are too young to be named, were sentenced at Newport Crown Court last month, and the girl's 35-year-old mother hoped to rebuild her daughter's shattered life.

Online abuse: After two boys were sentenced for raping a ten-year-old, she was accused of 'asking for it'

But soon after the sentencing - the boys avoided jail because of their age - a family friend of one of the boys wrote on Facebook that the young victim 'asked for it'.

A stream of abuse then followed, with one troller accusing the girl of crying rape when she had consented, and another saying it was her fault. 

The girl's mother went to police but they told her they weren't able to help, and told her to talk to Facebook, who told her the comments didn't breach their 'community standards'. 

The Facebook page had nearly 200 comments on it by the time the girl's mother contacted the person who set it up and persuaded them to take it down.

Last year she had had to cope with similar harassment after the mother of one of the boys posted the victim's name and address on Facebook.  She later took it down after police intervened. 

Today the girl's mother spoke of the nightmare she and her daughter have lived through since the boys were arrested over the rape last August.

She told the Sun: 'I thought that after the guilty verdict in court we would get our lives back, but it has got worse.

'It is heart-breaking for my daughter - she is a prisoner here.'

Judge Ian Murphy, left, didn't send the boys to jail but gave them curfews and tags instead - Monmouth MP David Davies, right, has called the sentences 'pathetic' and asked the Attorney General to review them

Last month, the boys, who are both now 14 and were found guilty of rape after denying the offence, were given tags for three months and put under a curfew.

They were also given rehabilitation orders with intense supervision. 

Judge Ian Murphy told them: 'This is a very serious offence. Had you been adults you would have been looking at a lengthy custodial sentence.'

Today the victims' mother criticised the boys' sentences as 'pathetic', a cause local Conservative MP David Davies has taken up.

He has written to the Attorney General asking for the boys' sentences to be reconsidered.

'I'm absolutely appalled at the way this girl has been treated both in her community and by the judicial system,' Mr Davies said. 

And he expressed his disgust at what he called the 'sickening campaign of persecution' the girl and her family had suffered.

A spokesman for Gwent Police said that the online comments about the girl were not criminal so they had no grounds to take action. 

They said: 'We endeavour to give victims of crime and their families all the support they need to live their lives safely and securely.

'In this case we were made aware of some comments which appeared on a Facebook page. Officers visited the home of the victim and viewed the comments, which whilst distasteful, were not criminal in nature.

'Officers had no grounds to take formal action and in good faith suggested the victim take the matter up directly with Facebook.

'We continue to support the family, and an officer has been dedicated to discuss and deal with any concerns they may.'  

A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service told MailOnline: 'Our case was clear that this was rape and the jury convicted for rape.'

A Facebook spokesman admitted the posts should have been taken down as implying a minor can consent to or ask for sex did breach their standards.

They said: 'We encourage people to report things that they find offensive so we can investigate and remove if it breaks our rules.

'Unfortunately we don’t always get it right and on this occasion we should have removed the group. We are sorry for any upset or distress this may have caused.'
