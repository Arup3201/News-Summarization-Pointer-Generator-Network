Greek Orthodox church officials have baptised a dolphin following its remarkable recovery after being found close to death on a beach.

The young animal, which has now been given the name Anastasis, which translates as Resurrection in English, was rescued on the coast of Damnoni beach in southern Rethymno in Greece.

A small group of volunteers from the city of approximately 40,000 people discovered it almost helpless after apparently being separated from the rest of its family.

One of the rescuers spent a night trying to help to keep the dolphin afloat so that it could breathe -Â  dolphins need to regularly come up to the surface to get air and will suffocate if they are unable to regularly go to the surface.

Tydeus Aeneas, 36, a forester who was in the area with his eight-year-old son Palaemon volunteered to spend the entire night with the animal.

The animal quickly recuperated with their care and gained in strength and confidence.
