Soaring numbers of Paddington Bear fans are trying their hands at making marmalade- thanks to last Christmas' hugely successful film.

The British movie, which followed the adventures of the marmalade-loving bear from Peru, became the highest-ever grossing non-Hollywood family film after banking $200million at the box office.

The 'Paddington Effect', coined by trade magazine The Grocer in December, has since seen rocketing surges in sales of marmalade- such as Golden Shred which has reported an increase of 24 per cent.

Now fans, inspired by the film, appear to be making their own preserve at home after one of the oldest names in jam making reported a major hike in their winter sales.

Sales of Certo liquid pectin- an essential gelling agent for homemade jams and marmalades made from plant extract- are up 34 per cent year-on-year over the last three months.

James Amar, Brand Manager for Certo, the UK's only liquid pectin maker, said: 'While demand for Certo peaks over the summer months at the height of the summer-fruit, jam-making season, we'd typically expect a less pronounced increase in sales December to February with the arrival of Seville oranges.

'This year, sales have rocketed and it seems the bear from deepest, darkest Peru with a passion for marmalade has rekindled the nation's appetite for this distinctive preserve.'

Waitrose also reported soaring sales in marmalade-related products such as preserving sugar and Seville oranges. The supermarket also found a 282 per cent increase in people downloading the Waitrose Quick and Easy Seville Marmalade recipe.

Tim Stevens, fresh fruit buyer at Waitrose, said last month: 'It's great news that more people than ever are discovering the joys of making marmalade at home — perhaps it is the influence of Paddington Bear.' 

Industry magazine The Grocer had previously shown that British shoppers were falling out of love with marmalade, as consumers turned to nut butters and chocolate spreads instead.

But it reported that the release of Paddington shortly before Christmas had provided a boost for traditional British preserve.

The film, which cost $55million to produce, saw the duffle coat-wearing bear dispatched from his native jungle by his aunt Lucy following an earthquake

Directed by Paul King, the independently-made film proved to be a huge hit around the world, finding favour with families and critics alike.

The film, which cost $55million to produce, saw the duffle coat-wearing bear dispatched from his native jungle by his aunt Lucy following an earthquake.

Before its release, the British Board of Film Classification gave Paddington’ a parental guidance rating, saying it contained ‘dangerous behaviour, mild threat, mild sex references and mild bad language.’

The board said the film's scenes of dangerous behaviour included the bear hiding inside a refrigerator. The rating means some scenes may be unsuitable for children under 8 years old.

The development left English author Michael Bond, who created the original Paddington Bear series of books, ‘totally amazed’.
