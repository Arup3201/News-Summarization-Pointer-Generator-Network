Apple is developing a cheaper version of its iPhone and could launch the new device as early as this year.

The tech giant has been exploring a lower-end iPhone for years but plans have accelerated as Apple's supremacy in smartphones has slipped, sources told the Wall Street Journal.

The less expensive phone is likely to resemble the standard iPhone, but with a different, cheaper body. Making the shell out of polycarbonate plastic rather than the aluminum casing of the iPhone 5 would allow Apple to lower the cost.

Most of the other parts could remain the same or be recycled from older iPhone models, according to the WSJ.

Launching the cheaper phone would be a big shift in corporate strategy. Under former chief executive Steve Jobs, Apple prided itself prioritizing profits over scale and offered a relatively small number of products mostly targeting the high end.

The less expensive iPhone has been in the works since at least 2009, with the company seeing it as a way to grab market share and introduce people to the brand, sources close to the project said.

They added that prior to the iPhone 4's mid-2010 launch, Apple had developed designs for cheaper phones that differed only in the material used for the back and sides.

But the idea was shelves after some executives raised concerns that a second product would complicate its manufacturing processes.

According to the WSJ, the company chose instead to keep older iPhone models on sale for less.

But Apple now faces greater pressure to make the iPhone more affordable.Â 

The iPhone 5 without a wireless contract starts at $649 in the U.S., which is out of reach for many customers in countries where carriers don't help cover the cost of the phone.

A raft of cheaper rivals powered by Google Inc.'s Android operating system are gaining market share.

The iPhone remains the top-selling 
smartphone in the U.S., but Apple's share of the high-end mobile phone 
market has fallen in China and remains low in other emerging markets.

Apple's worldwide smartphone shipments have dropped from 23 per cent of the total in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 14.6 per cent in the third quarter last year.

The iPhone is Apple's chief revenue driver, with sales of iPhones and related products and services accounting for 48% of revenue in the quarter ended in September.

Samsung Electronics Co.'s share, meanwhile, jumped from 8.8 per cent to 31.3 per cent from the third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2012.

But Apple could still decide to scrap the plan, the WSJ reported as executives still fear the less-expensive iPhone could curb profits and put off investors.

Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster, however, told the WSJ that a less expensive iPhone won't necessarily hurt Apple's overall profit margin if it attracts buyers who haven't bought iPhones before and not those who would have been willing to purchase the higher-end device.
