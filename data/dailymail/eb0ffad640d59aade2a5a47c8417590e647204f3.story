Attacked: Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home from school

The horrific moment a Taliban gunman boarded a packed school bus and shot a teenage education
 activist twice at point blank range has been relived by her devastated friend.

Malala Yousafzai, 14, was critically injured
 after being shot while travelling home from school earlier this week.

The brave teenager was targeted by the Taliban after speaking out against atrocities committed under the regime.

According to Malala's friend Shazia, speaking to the Christian Science 
Monitor, a group of militants riding on a bike stopped the bus carrying the schoolgirls.

Masked men then boarded the vehicle and pointed guns at the girls, 
asking for Malala.

A hooded Taliban militant shouted: 'Which one of you is Malala? Speak 
up, otherwise I will shoot you all. She is propagating against the 
soldiers of Allah, the Taliban. She must be punished.'

Almost as soon as he shouted this, the militant recognised the youngster and shot her at point blank range.

The
 shooting has horrified people in Pakistan and internationally, and has 
been followed by an outpouring of respect for a girl who earned the 
enmity of the Taliban for publicising their acts and speaking about the 
importance of girls' education.

The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying that the girl was promoting 'Western thinking'.

Malala was shot twice at close range and is currently unconscious in hospital in a critical condition.

Speaking to CBS News, a close friend of the family said doctors had given relatives a 'ray of hope' .

The woman said MRI scans showed that a bullet which had entered the skull did not cause significant damage to her brain.

A number of people have been arrested
 by police in Pakistan in connection with the shooting.

A
 Taliban spokesman said the top leadership of the Taliban's Swat Valley 
chapter decided two months ago to kill Yousufzai in a carefully-planned 
attack after her family ignored repeated warnings.

Attempt: A Pakistani Taliban organisation have 
taken responsibility for the shooting which also injured another girl on
 the bus leaving their school in Mingora

Police have been questioning people in
 the town of Mingora, where the shooting took place.It is believed they 
are holding two people in custody with suspected links to the shooting.

Mingora
 police chief Afzal Khan Afridi said arrests had been made, but he 
declined to give any details about the number of people detained or what
 role they're suspected in having in the shooting. He said he did not 
want to endanger the ongoing investigation.

The
 Taliban spokesman, Sirajuddin Ahmad, said her family had been warned 
three times - the most recent warning coming last week - before the 
decision was made to execute her.

Ahmad
 said the local Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah and his deputies 
selected three attackers, including two trained snipers, who carefully 
studied the girl's route home from school.

Even before the Taliban took over the Swat Valley, Fazlullah's radio broadcasts spread fear among residents in the area.

The
 group first started to exert its influence in 2007 and quickly extended
 its reach to much of the valley by the next year.

Help: Crowds gathered around the hospital as news quickly spread about the attempted assassination of the young peace activist

They set about 
imposing their will on residents by forcing men to grow beards, 
preventing women from going to the market and blowing up many schools - 
the majority for girls.

Malala
 wrote about these practices in a journal for the BBC under a pseudonym 
when she was just 11. After the Taliban were pushed out of the valley in
 2009 by the Pakistani military, she became even more outspoken in 
advocating for girls' education.

She appeared frequently in the media 
and was given one of the country's highest honours for civilians for her
 bravery.

Fazlullah, along 
with much of the Swat Taliban's top leadership, escaped the offensive 
and is believed to be operating from a base in eastern Afghanistan and 
sending fighters back across the border to attack northwest Pakistan.

Yousufzai
 is now being treated at a military hospital in the city of Rawalpindi. A
 military spokesman says her condition is satisfactory but the next 
36-48 hours would be crucial.

The schoolgirl had been transferred to the specialist hospital following Taliban threats to kill her, and authorities in Pakistan decided to move her for her own safety.

Regional governor Masood Kausar said earlier this week: 
'The security agencies are closely working with each other and they have
 a lot of information about the perpetrators. We hope our security 
agencies will soon capture them and bring to justice.'

The shooting has drawn condemnation 
from world leaders and many Pakistanis. There have been protests 
against the Taliban across the country in support of Malala.

Her father, Ziauddin Yousufzai, who 
runs a girls' school, said his daughter had defied threats for years, 
believing the good work she was doing for her community was her best 
protection.

'Pray for her,' her distraught uncle Faiz Mohammad said as Malala was taken from the hospital in Peshawar to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi.

A husband-and-wife team of two 
British doctors who were attending a seminar in Pakistan joined 
local surgeons in treating Yousufzai.

Earlier this week, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the United States had offered any assistance necessary.

'The President found the news reprehensible and disgusting and tragic,' Carney told reporters.

'Directing violence at children is 
barbaric, it's cowardly, and our hearts go out to her and the others who
 were wounded as well as their families.'

Yousufzai had spent the last three years campaigning for girls' education after the Taliban shut down girls' schools.

She received Pakistan's highest civilian award but also a number of death threats.

Fury over the attack has spread across 
the country, with demonstrators protesting in Lahore, Peshawar, 
Islamabad and Mingora.

Many schools in Swat Valley closed 
their doors in protest over the shooting, and the country's army chief 
vowed to fight on against militants as anger erupted across the nation.

The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) 
have taken responsibility for the assassination attempt and told a 
Pakistani newspaper they will target her again if she survives.

A man approached the school bus and 
asked which one of the girls was Malala, Rasool Shah, Mingora police 
chief said.

Malala was pointed out by a girl near her, but after the young activist lied about her identity the gunman shot both of them.
