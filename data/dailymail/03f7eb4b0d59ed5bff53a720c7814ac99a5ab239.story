Cardiff City will need to bid £5m to prise Jose Fonte from Southampton.

The Bluebirds have already had two bids turned down for the 30-year-old this summer, the latest a £3.25m bid.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to fill the void left by Steven Caulker's departure, who joined QPR earlier this week for £8million, as quickly as possible and sees Fonte as the ideal replacement.

Experience: Jose Fonte could be set for a move to Championship side Cardiff City this summer

After relegation from the Premier League last season, Solskjaer will be hoping his first full season in English football will be of complete contrast to his first taste of it.

Despite losing the likes of Caulker and most recently Fraizer Campbell to Crystal Palace, the former Manchester United striker has bolstered his squad with a number of additions this summer.

The signing of Adam Le Fondre from Reading was a considerable coup, with a proven track record at this level, as Solskjaer hopes to guide the Welsh side back to the Premier League at the first time of asking.Elsewhere, Federico Macheda and Javi Guerra have also been brought in, with midfielders Guido Burgstaller and Kagisho Dikgacoi, plus goalkeeper Charlie Horton penning deals at the Championship side.
