Nick Clegg called for a police inquiry into the Cyril Smith scandal last night after finally admitting that there may have been an Establishment cover-up.

After two weeks of obfuscation and denial, the Liberal Democrat leader at last conceded the need for a full police inquiry into the 29-stone paedophile’s vile sex crimes.

He called for a probe into allegations of a conspiracy in which senior politicians, police and the security services colluded to cover up the former Rochdale MP’s reign of abuse over several decades.

Accusing Smith of ‘truly grotesque acts’, Mr Clegg called on the police to investigate whether there was a wider paedophile ring involving politicians from all parties, not just his own.

Changing his tune: Nick Clegg has called for a police inquiry into the Cyril Smith scandal after finally admitting there may have been an Establishment cover-up

But Mr Clegg still refuses to launch an investigation into what Liberal politicians knew about Smith’s abuse and whether they could have acted to bring him to justice.

What the Deputy Prime Minister is desperate to avoid is an investigation that focuses solely on his party. However, Mr Clegg would not explain how any police inquiry would operate, saying it was up to the police to decide who should be questioned and which documents should be examined.

Campaign: Simon Danczuk, the current Labour MP for Rochdale, welcomed Mr Clegg's change of heart

Although his call falls short of demands for a full public inquiry into historic child sex abuse cases, it is the first time Mr Clegg has accepted that the Establishment’s reaction to the scandal had not been good enough.

Simon Danczuk, the campaigning Labour MP for Rochdale, welcomed the change of heart but said it was a shame Mr Clegg had to be led ‘kicking and screaming’ to make it.

He called on police to question former Liberal leader Lord Steel, who recommended Smith for a knighthood in 1988 despite claims that rumours of his abuse were known at the highest levels.

Police believe Smith, who died in 2010, abused dozens of boys at care homes in Rochdale and London during the 1960s and 1970s.

Despite numerous investigations, he was never charged with any offence. Three times the Director of Public Prosecutions rejected police files detailing his abuse, claiming the cases would not stand up in court.

An explosive book by Mr Danczuk, serialised in the Mail, reveals that Smith was protected by local politicians, the police and even the security services. He claims other politicians were involved in abuse, and that Smith may have been at the heart of a paedophile ring.

When the allegations first came to light, Mr Clegg rejected calls for further inquiries – saying an internal probe had shown that no one knew anything.

He was also accused of obfuscation by saying the allegations dated from before the formation of the Lib Dems, and that many of them dated from before he was born.

Yesterday, however, speaking in Colchester at the launch of the Lib Dems’ European election campaign, he said: ‘The accusations and allegations surrounding Cyril Smith are very, very serious.

‘They are also part of a set of allegations that there was a wider conspiracy involving politicians from other parties involving a cover-up by the police and security services. This was looked into by the police in the past and not pursued.

‘A police inquiry is the only way we can get to the bottom of something which spans so many decades, which covered so many different organisations, and touches on so many different political parties and the police.

‘That is why I very much hope that, in addition to the inquiries the police are already conducting into children’s homes where abuse is alleged to have taken place, that they will not hesitate to reopen this so that every aspect can be looked at and people, particularly victims, can feel that justice is finally being done.’

Mr Clegg said police should also look at whether other politicians were involved in a paedophile ring. But he denied he was evading his party’s responsibility to investigate the scandal.

‘It involves reprehensible criminal acts and collusion, covering up of those criminal acts,’ he said. ‘That is not something that any political party could possibly resolve.’

Mr Danczuk welcomed Mr Clegg’s call for an investigation as a ‘step in the right direction’.

He added: ‘I think it is a shame that Nick Clegg has taken two weeks to do this. He is the Deputy Prime Minister after all; one of the most powerful people in the country. He should have taken the issue of paedophilia and cover-ups much more seriously than he has in the past, and it is unfortunate that he has been dragged kicking and screaming to this position.’

Last night a Lib Dem MP said there must have been people in Westminster in the 1970s who had heard the rumours of Smith’s abuse but kept quiet.

David Ward, MP for Bradford East, said: ‘They should have done something about it. Where there are rumours they should be investigated, however important that person is within the organisation.’
