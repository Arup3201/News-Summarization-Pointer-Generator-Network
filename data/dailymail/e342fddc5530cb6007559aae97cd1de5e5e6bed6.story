Cursing past: A new biography reveals that ten-year-old Michelle Obama swore like a trooper

As first lady of the United States she can be nothing but the epitome of grace, elegance and politeness as she mingles with world leaders and celebrities at the White House and further afield.

But it was not always so for Michelle Obama, who as a child was so foul-mouthed she lost out on an award at summer camp aged 10, according to a new biography.

The first lady-to-be was an avid attendee at a day camp on the shores of Lake Michigan, and stood out as the most capable in her age group.

But camp leaders were so taken aback by her salty tongue that they denied her a prestigious award when the camp ended, according to biographer Peter Slevin, whose Michelle Obama: A Life was previewed by People magazine.

Michelle Robinson, as she was then known, as so stunned by the revelation that she changed her ways immediately and put an end to her 'cursing phase'.

The anecdote surfaced in the upcoming book on Mrs Obama, which also includes the revelation that her mother was anxious about her marriage to future president Barack Obama – because he is mixed race rather than completely black.

Slevin quotes her as saying: 'I was going through my cursing stage.'

'I didn't realize until my camp counselor at the end came up and said: "You know, you would have been best camper in your age group, but you curse so much".'

'And I thought I was being cool.'

Mrs. Obama used to attend the camp regularly with her brother, Craig. She would have been ten years old at the camp held in 1974, while Craig would have been 11.

Revelation: The anecdote about the young Michelle Obama (pictured right aged seven), emerged in the upcoming biography Michelle Obama: A Life by Peter Slevin, due out April 7

The story about her once-foul mouth has emerged before: In 2013 she recounted the story to a group of reporters while promoting her anti-obesity campaign.

It was then she revealed that the development stopped her swearing ways dead in their tracks, never to return.

The first lady is currently giving her hard-won politeness an outing on the world stage, touring Asia to promote girls' education.

She arrived in Cambodia Friday, where she spent time with the prime minister's wife and met high school students and education experts.
