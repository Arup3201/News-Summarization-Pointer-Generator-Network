This is the heart-stopping moment a mechanic narrowly avoided being crushed by a tyre which crashed into the side of his car after coming loose from a 4x4. 

Thomas Doherty, 23, was about to start working on the vehicle at Kings Heath, Birmingham, when the heavy wheel came careering down the road. 

The wheel bounced down towards Mr Doherty, whose head would have been crushed if next to the wing mirror when the tyre struck.

The tyre came loose when a Range Rover was driving down the road next to the garage in Birmingham 

It came roaring towards the vehicles lined up at the front of the garage as mechanics inside carry on working 

The freak incident at All Electric Garage was captured on CCTV, showing Mr Doherty looking startled as the roars past. 

'I had the keys in my hand. If I had been moments later, I would have been in hit.

'It was a big shock.

'As I was walking across, I thought it was a jack rolling across the floor but, before I knew it, there was this massive bang. It was the last thing I expected.

'It did a bit of damage to the car but I was lucky I wasn't beside it.' 

Garage manager Mark Daniels, 45, was in the building at the time.

He said: 'The gentleman was driving down the road in his Land Rover.

The tyre bounces over the bonnets of all the cars lined  up at the front of the garage where Mr Doherty is preparing to begin work 

The 23-year-old looks startled as the car he was moments away from starting work on shakes suddenly 

The garage's manager came out to inspect the vehicles after the incident which he said could have killed the young mechanic if he'd been a moment sooner 

'He was about 100 yards away from the garage and then the near side front wheel came off and the car just dropped to the road.

'The wheel hit a kerb, which caused it to bounce up to chest height. It came off one car’s bonnet and then wedged itself into our Skoda.

'It frightened the mechanic out of his skin. It could have killed an individual at the speed it was going at.  He was a bit shaken up.

'The Skoda needed a new bonnet, wing and headlamp.'
