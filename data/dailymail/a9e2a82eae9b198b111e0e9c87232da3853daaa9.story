Ray Mears told Radio 4's Desert Island Discs the government plans go against the original idea of the Green Belt

Survival expert Ray Mears is ready to fight for the protection of Britain’s Green Belt in the face of government plans to build more new homes.

He says building on the such land is a betrayal of the original idea of preserving the countryside for future generations.

The television personality appears on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs today and tells host Kirsty Young: ‘There is huge pressure to build on the Green Belt.

'As I understood it, that was put aside in perpetuity by our ancestors, our elders, and I think it should still be so.’

He accepts the need to build new homes, but adds: ‘If we don’t have green spaces, what sort of people do we become living in those houses?’

The Green Belt began as a policy for controlling urban growth in the 1940s and 1950s and was encouraged by local and central government.

Mears, 49, also talks about how he used his bushcraft skills to help track down fugitive killer Raoul Moat, who went on a shooting spree after he was released from prison in 2010, sparking one of Britain’s largest ever manhunts.

And he recalls the pain of the death of his first wife Rachel in 2006, then being ‘knocked off his feet’ when he met second wife Ruth 18 months later.

He says: ‘I was delivering a lecture in Newcastle and this apparition appeared from the crowds at the end of the show and literally knocked me off my feet.

‘The force of energy she brought was quite something.

'I literally fell over – head over heels. It was a thunderbolt.’

Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 today at 11.15am and repeated at 9am on Friday.
