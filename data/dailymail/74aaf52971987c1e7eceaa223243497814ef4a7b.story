Britain was once famed around the world for being home to a nation of gentle, mild-mannered folk who minded their Ps and Qs.

But instead of using the age old phrase 'thank you' to show our appreciation, we are now more likely to say ‘cheers’, ‘ta’ or ‘that’s great’.

A new study has found terms such as ‘cool’, ‘brilliant’, ‘lovely’ and even ‘boom’ have firmly rooted themselves in our vernacular.

Boom! Like Ali G, Britons have abandoned the well-worn phrase thank you in favour of less formal terms

Other common ways of offering thanks include ‘you star’, ‘super’, ‘wicked’ and ‘okay’.

Researchers found four in 10 people 
prefer not to say 'thank you' because the phrase is too formal, while 13
per cent deem it ‘old fashioned’.

Of the 2,000 Brits who took part in the study, which was commissioned by banking firm First Direct to launch its new 'Big Thank You' campaign, 83 per cent thought more effort 
needed to be made to regularly show gratitude.

An alarming six in 10 respondents believed Britain was now 'quite rude'.

And while more than half felt appreciated by their partners, only five per cent felt loved by their bosses.

But despite the apparent shift in our national psyche, two thirds of people still like to regularly appreciate others in everyday conversation, just not necessarily in the most traditional way.

First Direct's head of customer communications Zoe Shore said: 'The key thing to remember is that people still like to give and receive thanks, but in the modern world there are a million different ways to do this.

'You’ll probably find that people use different phrases to thank others, depending on what situation they are in and who they are speaking to.

'So words such as boom, cool and wicked might be deemed appropriate with your mates, but not quite so suitable for a work setting, or when talking to an elder.

'But being told you are appreciated, no matter how this is expressed - through words, cards, letters or otherwise - is a great feeling.'

The study shows eight in 10 people believe others should always be thanked for kind actions, with 25 per cent saying it doesn’t matter if it’s just a little wave of acknowledgement.

But a third of those polled admitted they probably could do with showing their appreciation a little more, such as buying someone flowers, sending a card, or sending a gift.

We say thank you to shop workers (33 per cent) more than our parents (26 per cent) or teachers (four per cent).

Brits will most commonly thank someone when given change, when receiving a present or if someone buys them a drink.

Shop assistants are among the people we thank the most

Other actions which usually result in some form of thank you include someone holding the door open, someone telling you that you look great, or when someone saves a space for you.

But when on the receiving end of thanks, 64 per cent say that just hearing those special words - or something similar - makes them feel that everything was worth the effort.

Ms Shore added: 'Thanking people is something we’re big on.

'Showing appreciation is a two way thing. Our consistently great customer service means we get thanked regularly, and we also want to say a big thanks to all our customers for banking with us.

'We all show appreciation in different ways - as long as it means something to the person on the receiving end and makes them feel good, that’s all that matters.'
