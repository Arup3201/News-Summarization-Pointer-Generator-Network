Brazen: Lisa Marie Grant, 34, has been jailed for mooning at a school bus full of children

A mother of a middle school student has been jailed for one month after mooning and flashing one of her breasts at the boy's bus driver, telling the employee to 'kiss my white butt'.

Lisa Marie Grant, 34,  was sentenced to six months in jail with all but one month suspended and fined $250 for  disorderly conduct for the bizarre incident, which unfolded in Suffolk, Virginia last year.

Her bold performance, which was also witnessed by a bus full of children, came after she went to the stop with her son and four-year-old daughter to speak with the driver, Melba Osborne, about how her son was being disciplined.

Osborne had sent a letter home with a conduct notice after the boy had been hitting other students and switching seats during the journeys, WTKR reported.

But when Grant arrived at the bus stop, Osborne did not allow her to board the bus and would only address her through a window, the arrest warrant said.

'I was just shocked. I didn't want her to get on the bus. She was acting wild,' Osborne told WTKR.

Speaking out: The driver, Melba Osborne (left), refused to allow the women on the bus to speak about her son's discipline issues so Grant (right) pulled down her trousers. Grant denied that she showed skin

Grant 'became very irate and began 
cursing' before blocking the path of the bus and spreading her arms, the warrant said.

'She turned around, pulled her pants down, her underclothes down, bent over and told me to kiss her behind,' Osborne said.

Grant agreed with some of this account, telling the news channel: 'I told her to kiss my white butt. I never not once mooned. I never not once shower her any body part, apart from my dress.'

The arrest warrant stated Grant exposed her buttocks and one breast.

Inappropriate: The bus in Suffolk, Virginia was filled with around 45 children at the time of the incident

The woman's children, who were standing holding hands beside the bus, witnessed the incident.

'It was totally inappropriate,' Osborne said. 'What 
parent would stand there and pull their pants and panties down with 
their 14-year-old child standing beside them? It was ridiculous.'

Grant's son no longer rides the bus and his mother drives him instead.

A General District Court judge also found Grant not guilty of an indecent exposure charge on Tuesday.
