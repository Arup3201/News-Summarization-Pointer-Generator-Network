A sperm donor said today that he would not have donated to a lesbian couple had he known the huge financial responsibility that has now fallen to him.

William Marotta fathered a child with Angela Bauer, 40, and partner Jennifer Schreiner, 34, who found him via Craigslist three years ago.

The three signed a legal document which 
stated Mr Marotta, a married mechanic who fosters children with his 
wife, would have no rights to the child.

However now the state of Kansas is demanding Mr Marotta pay $6,000 in child support after the lesbian couple were forced onto welfare when Ms Bauer lost her job.

Second thoughts: William Marotta, who acted as a sperm donor for a lesbian couple in 2009 and gave up parental rights, is being chased by Kansas State for $6,000 in child support

Backing: Angela Bauer said today that Mr Marotta had her complete support in fighting the state department and that she and her former partner Jennifer Schreiner were eternally grateful to him for giving them a daughter

Mr Marotta wanted to help the couple and along with his wife Kimberly turned down their payment of $50 to donate his sperm for free.

He told the Today show: 'If you are two women, it's difficult without a man there, so I donated.'

He added: 'No good deed goes unpunished.'

Mr Marotta said that he would likely never have donated his sperm if he had known the financial burden. His wife Kimberly added: 'This is not at all what we signed up for.'

Marotta is asking that the case be dismissed, arguing that he is not the child's legal father. A hearing is set for January 8.

The mechanic applied to the ad in 2009 after Bauer wrote: 'We are foster and adoptive parents and 
now we desire to share a pregnancy and birth together.'

Mr Marotta provided sperm which was 
used for artificial insemination by her partner, Ms Schreiner. In 
return, he gave up parental rights including financial duties for the 
child.Â 

Ms Bauer also spoke
 to the Today show on Thursday about her gratitude to Mr Marotta and how
 they supported him in his fight against Kansas state.

She said: 'We never intended for him [Marotta] to support her. That's our responsibility we have as her parents. I have the joy of raising her and loving her and it's only because of William.'

Kansas Department for Children and Families spokeswoman Angela de Rocha said on Wednesday that when a single mother seeks benefits for a child, the department routinely tries to determine the child's paternity and require the father to make support payments to lessen the potential cost to taxpayers.

She argued that the law regarding artificial insemination is an incentive for donors and prospective mothers to work with a doctor.

'I believe that is the intent of the law, so that we don't end up with these ambiguous situations,' she said.

Bauer and Schreiner updated Marotta on their daughter's well-being occasionally but he has had little contact, according to the Kansas City Star.

The arrangement changed earlier this year when Ms Schreiner, the only parent registered on her daughter's birth certificate, applied for social welfare.

Ms Bauer had been supporting the child but was left unable to work due to ill health.

On October 3, 2012, attorney Mark McMillan filed a petition on behalf of the Department of Children and Families seeking a ruling that Marotta is the father of Schreiner's child and owes a duty to support her.

It said the department provided cash assistance totaling $189 for the girl for July through September 2012, and had paid medical expenses totaling nearly $6,000.

Schreiner had allegedly been put under pressure to reveal Mr Marotta's name so that her daughter could continue to have health care.

The legal agreement that the three made in 2009 was deemed invalid by Kansas state because they did not use a certified doctor for the insemination.

It may appear unconventional but searching for sperm donors on Craigslist is not unheard of.

In 2010, the popular cafemom blog lit up in outrage after a man from Beaverton, Oregon advertised his sperm donor services on Craigslist. He wrote: 'I'm ready to help. We'd be very discreet, no one needs to know.'

Another ad for a potential donor in San Diego read: 'I'm not offering thrilling risky sex, just pregnancy.'

Craigslist requires that users agree to guidelines when posting ads for services.

However the site 'does not control, is not responsible for and makes no representations or warranties with respect to any user content... You must conduct any necessary, appropriate, prudent or judicious investigation, inquiry, research and due diligence with respect to any user content'.

Among the long list of banned items on Craigslist are illegal goods; offensive material including porn and anything deemed malicious or fraudulent. There is no mention of sperm donors.

Ms Bauer and Ms Schreiner, who separated in 2010, plan to help Mr Marotta fight the state's decision.

Hannah Schroller, Mr Marotta's attorney, argued that the case was consistent with a 2007 case in which the Kansas Supreme Court denied parental rights to a man who sought them after providing a sperm donation under similar circumstances.

A licensed physician performed the insemination in the 2007 case.

Schroller wrote that Marotta took the same actions as the man in the 2007 case did, and he - like that man - should be considered a sperm donor, not a father.

She stressed that sperm banks regularly ship donations for the intended purpose of artificial insemination within the United States and abroad to both residential and medical facility addresses.

Schroller argued in court documents that if a donor is free of parental responsibility only when a doctor performs an insemination, 'then any woman in Kansas could have sperm donations shipped to her house, inseminate herself without a licensed physician and seek out the donor for financial support because her actions made him a father, not a sperm donor.

'This goes against the very purpose of the statute to protect sperm donors as well as birth mothers'.

Ms Bauer and Ms Schreiner had been together for eight years and adopted eight children. 
They ended their relationship in 2010 but continue to co-parent their 
sons and daughters who range from three months to 25 years old.

The
 state of Kansas does not recognize same-sex unions, so each of their 
children was registered for adoption by a single parent.

A motion to dismiss the state's case will be heard in Shawnee County District Court on January 8.
