The typical Fifties pin-up girl was slim and conventionally-posed. But a recently-unearthed collection of images has revealed the less familiar Hilda, a plus-sized redhead who broke the mold with her plump figure and light-hearted demeanor.

A year after the death of Duane Bryers, the artist who created her, online gallery ToilGirls has published prints of one of America's longest-running pin-up girls, who graced calendars from the mid-Fifties until the Eighties.

Although Hilda's creator passed away, his red-headed cartoon lives on today as a testament to the sex appeal of fuller-bodied women.

Plus-size pin-up: Artist Duane Bryers used watercolor to create plump and endearing pin-up girl Hilda in the mid-Fifties, and she graced calendars for 36 years

Not only was Hilda one of the only plus-sized pin-up girls of her time, but she also displayed a fun, carefree and somewhat clumsy attitude, making her all the more charming.

In one of Bryers' paintings, Hilda leans forward suggestively, squeezing between two rungs of a ladder to paint a wall.

A handkerchief hangs out of the back of her yellow bikini, barely covering her ample behind.

Another image shows an almost-nude Hilda warming up in front of a furnace, flashing a cheeky smile as she covers her breasts with her red pajamas.

Bryers told the Arizona Daily Star in 2010: 'I got the idea for a plumpy gal pinup 
and thought I'd like to make it into a calendar series. But how was I going to sell a plump girl?'

He
 then brought the series to the U.S.'s top calendar maker at the time, 
Brown & Bigelow, who 'reluctantly put it in the line and figured it 
would last a short time.'

In
 reality, while she may have been less prominent because of her curvaceous figure, the Hilda series endured for more than three decades, and today there are 
numerous Tumblr, Facebook and Pinterest pages dedicated to the buxom 
redhead.

One of a kind: Many Hilda fans today admire her uniqueness in a world of thin and conventionally attractive female icons

Many Hilda fans admire her uniqueness in a world of thin and conventionally attractive pin-up girls.

One writer wrote on his blog:
 'If one's natural male instinct is to respond to the rounder, softer, 
more generously proportioned woman, you will understand why there is so 
much to like about [Hilda].'

'Her fresh and fun-filled freckled face create a symphony for the eyes. She's simply peachy-keen'

The blogger calls Hilda a 'vision of femininity' and 'an ideal example of full-figure perfection.'

She is all the more special in that 
Duane Bryers did not base her on a real life model, but instead 
fashioned her from his own imagination and fantasy.

'She's a creation out of my head,' the artist told online pin-up gallery ToilGirls in 2002.

'I had 
various models over the years, but some of my best Hilda paintings I've 
ever done were done without a model.'

Making a splash: One painting shows her diving into water, causing the flower bikini to float away. She humorously puffs up her cheeks and blows bubbles as her nude curves are put on display

Hilda is often depicted wearing just a bikini made out of flowers which strategically cover her assets.

Artist and art collector Les Toil created a blog dedicated to Hilda after discovering one of her calendars in an antique shop.

He
 recounts his reaction to the plus-sized pin-up when he first laid eyes on 
her: 'As I browse through the incredible paintings in this calendar, the
 personality of this zany redheaded maiden of mayhem unfolds,' he writes.

'Curious,
 creative, giddy, anxious, exasperated, troublesome, but always fun. To 
gaze upon Hilda is to gaze upon a hot playful Summer's day.

'Her
 large, full breasts, her round and gentle tummy, her thick curvaceous 
legs, and her fresh and fun-filled freckled face create a symphony for 
the eyes. She's simply peachy-keen.'
