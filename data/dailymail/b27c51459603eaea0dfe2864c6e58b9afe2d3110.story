Ched Evans was paid £20,000-a-week for more than three months in prison and was visited by Sheffield United's boss and co-owner... but will they welcome him back?

Sheffield United co-chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps have issued a statement denying reports that they have offered Ched Evans a new contract following his release from prison.

Evans, 25, left Wymott Prison on Friday having served half of a five-year sentence for rape.

The Sun  reported that the Welsh striker was to be offered a new deal by United, but the League One club have denied those allegations. However, they say that they are continuing to 'deliberate on a new deal.'

The statement, published on the club website, reads: 'Sheffield United has become aware of speculative media coverage concerning the immediate future of its former player Ched Evans.

'An article in The Sun today (Saturday 18th October) that Sheffield United has offered a contract to former player Ched Evans is false and damaging to the Club. 

'We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about Ched Evans.'

Family and friends arrived at Evans' mother's house in North Wales following his release on Friday

It was alleged that the two-year contract offered would have been worth £500,000 for the Wales international.

Evans was convicted of raping a 19-year-old girl in his home town of Rhyl in 2011, but was visited in prison by McCabe and manager Nigel Clough.

He maintained his fitness in the facility in the north west, and seems to be keen to return to football with the Blades, though it is still unclear whether they will welcome him back.

Sheffield United were still paying Evans' 20,000-a-week wages, Matt Lawton reports, for more than three months while he was in prison, but the chairmen refused to comment on that fact.

Publicly, the League One club say they are still wrestling with the moral dilemma of having a convicted rapist in their team. Phipps, has said they are 'puzzling' through the problem and will not necessarily reach a decision any time soon.

Many Blades fans have called for Evans to be rehabilitated but almost 150,000 people have signed an online petition urging the Bramall Lane club not to welcome him back.

Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales.

The footballer denied the offence but was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court.

He admitted having sex with her but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident.

The prosecution said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse.

Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald also admitted having sex with the victim but was found not guilty of the same charge.

An appeal against Evans' conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012.

His girlfriend, Natasha Massey, has led a campaign to have the conviction overturned.

Evans' case is due to be reviewed by the Criminal Case Review Commission in the coming weeks.

Sheffield United have steadfastly refused to comment on whether they will allow Evans to play again.

Earlier this week manager Nigel Clough said the matter had been discussed by the club's hierarchy. He said the decision was not his to make but would be made by the club 'in good time'.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said on Thursday that the owners of Sheffield United should 'think really long and hard' before deciding whether to allow Evans back.
