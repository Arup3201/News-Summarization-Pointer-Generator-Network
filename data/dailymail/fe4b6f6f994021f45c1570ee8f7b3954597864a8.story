Earning a spot in the first line of riders at SoulCycle is so competitive these days, it's being compared to nabbing a seat in the front row at Fashion Week.

Die-hard fans of the cult fitness movement - essentially a mixture of the hard-core aerobic spinning set to ear-splitting loud chart tunes - jostle for a spot at the front, where all eyes are on them and the pressure to perform is at its highest.

One SoulCycle instructor tells Daily Mail Online: 'The front row is definitely sought after, and is absolutely a status symbol.'

'If you're new, and you don't know what you're doing, you shouldn't sit in the front,' the instructor remarks. 

While there have been reports of some instructors going as far as to insist that only 'pre-approved' riders can sit in the front row, our source says that in reality, 'there is no such thing.'

She further adds that she would never ask a less-experienced rider to 'move back' herself, but there are instructors who do. One SoulCycle die-hard claims that inexperienced riders regularly get 'shamed' by fellow participants or moved to the back by instructors.

It's largely to boost morale for the rest of the class. 

Indeed, one of SoulCycle's many brand commandments, which are painted on the walls of every studio, is called 'The Pack.'

It states: 'There is a direct correlation between your energy and your neighbor’s ride. If you want to do your own thing, please don’t ride in the front row.'

One keen SoulCycle rider, 29-year-old Jeff Rosenbloom, based in New York, remarks that although anyone can technically book themselves a bike at the front of the class, 'no-one in their right mind would unless they were good enough.'

He notes: 'The pressure would be too much.' 

Another SoulCycle fanatic tells The New York Times that she refuses to take classes altogether unless she can sit at the head, claiming that riders in front of her 'get in the way' of her workout.

One devotee describes the day she was chosen to ride in the front, recalling: 'I was so honored and excited that he recognized me as a strong rider.

'I kept looking at myself in the mirror during class, thinking, "I feel strong and beautiful".'

SoulCycle, which boasts an astonishing retention rate of 85per cent, launched in 2006 and only has 26 locations in the U.S. so far, but it's growing fast, with plans to expand to London this year.

Jennifer Lawrence, Olivia Wilde, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Alessandra Ambrosio have all hopped onto SoulCycle's stationary bikes, with sessions priced at a hefty $34 for 45 minutes.

According to lifestyle tracking app MyFitnessPal, which analyzed data from its 47 million users last year, the average minutes logged at SoulCycle jumped by a staggering 78per cent compared to 2013.

'Our schedule for the week is posted on the site at noon every Monday, and that's when sign ups open up,' the aforementioned SoulCycle instructor informs us.

'There are literally thousands of people sitting on their computers at 11:59 waiting to book for their favorite instructors at a specific time on a specific bike.

'Some classes sell out in seconds.'
