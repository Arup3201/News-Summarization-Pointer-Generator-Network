The Commons expenses watchdog last night rebuked a Tory MP for writing 'abusive and offensive' messages to its staff.

Backbencher Karl McCartney was accused of adding notes to claims, telling one official they were 'talking sh*te', and condemning another as a 'pedantic SOAB'.

The criticism came just hours after Mr McCartney claimed he was the victim of 'bullying tactics' by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa).

Ipsa chief executive Andrew McDonald, right, said Lincoln MP Karl McCartney, left, called one expense watchdog official a 'pedantic SOAB' and wrote other 'offensive, abusive and condescending' notes

During Business Questions in the House today, Mr McCartney accused Ipsa chief executive Andrew McDonald of using 'false innuendo and subterfuge' to smear the name of politicians.

'What do you think that subsequent to me raising these issues of Ipsa's senior management's bullying tactics and threats to try and silence me regarding their spiralling costs?' the Lincoln MP asked Leader of the House Andrew Lansley.

'Do you think that their chief executive should show some backbone and meet with me as he refused to do so for over two and a half years, instead of attempting to smear Members of Parliament's names by false innuendo and subterfuge?'

However, in a letter this evening, Mr McDonald denied the bullying allegations and insisted Ipsa was providing good value to the taxpayer.

He went on: 'Some of the notes written by you, and attached to your claims, were recently brought to my attention.

'Having reviewed those notes, I was taken aback by the content, which ranged from the abusive ("you are a pedantic SOAB, aren't you?") through to the offensive ("you're talking sh*te") and on to the condescending ("simples - or didn't you do geography at Eton and Oxford...").

'We will do all that is reasonable to shield our team from such treatment. This policy and its application in your case have been expressly endorsed by the Board.

'I had hoped it would be possible to address this behaviour without writing to you formally. In the light of your comments today, I write to ask that you conduct your dealings with us - orally or in writing - in civil terms.

After Mr McCartney's question in the Commons, Speaker John Bercow said MPs 'must really play the rules'

'I do not ask you to like Ipsa or its policies. At the same time, Ipsa's team deserves to be treated in a courteous manner. I ask that, with immediate effect, you desist from correspondence which falls below this standard.'

Mr McDonald went on to reject the MP's claims that Ipsa was profligate, pointing out that its administration costs represent just 3.4 per cent of the Â£176milion public money it administers; and that it is delivering savings of more than 5 per cent a year.

'Any discussion of our costs should, I suggest, be informed by a full understanding of our role and responsibilities,' he said.

'Given your recent public reference to communication between yourself and Ipsa, I am publishing this letter.'

Last night Lucy Rigby, Labour's candidate for Lincoln, said: 'It is absolutely and genuinely shocking that Lincoln's MP would use this kind of language in letters to any body or organisation.

'I think voters in Lincoln will be appalled that they are being represented by someone who's obviously abusive, can't control himself and has no idea what kind of behaviour is appropriate for a Member of Parliament. This is embarrassing for Lincoln and Mr McCartney needs to apologise immediately.'

Mr McCartney, who was first elected in 2010, has attracted criticism for his offensive views on gay marriage. In a letter to a constituent, he said he felt it would lead to 'multi-partnership marriages and a reduction in the age of permitted marriage'.

After he raised the issue in the Commons earlier, Speaker John Bercow ruled that Mr McCartney's point was not a business question.

Mr Bercow said he should have requested a statement or a debate, saying: 'Members must really play by the rules and not invent them as they go along.'

Responding to the backbencher, Mr Lansley said: 'If it's helpful to the House, I will of course be happy to meet you and as a member, Mr Speaker, of your committee on Ipsa, I will be glad to take forward any issues you have.'

Mr McCartney was unavailable for comment last night.
