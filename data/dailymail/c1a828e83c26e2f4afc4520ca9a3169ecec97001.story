An Amy Winehouse impersonator  has revealed she has 'a hunch' she may be the late singer's secret half sister.

Laura Jane Butler, who was adopted at birth, is the only amateur singer to have received the endorsement of Miss Winehouse's parents as an impersonator since the star's death in 2011.

The 43-year-old, who claims she is so similar to the tragic star that her father struggles to watch her perform, has now said she believes that they may in fact be related.

Her claims have been refuted by Mitch Winehouse, whose agent dismissed them as 'rubbish', and the woman admits she has no evidence to suggest she is his daughter, other than the fact she knows little about her biological father.

'My likeness to her is uncanny. We also have similar mannerisms and similar personalities,' Ms Butler told the Daily Star.

'Mitch gets freaked out by my Amy tributes because I am so like Amy.'

The singer, whose adoptive father recently died, is in contact with her birth mother but knows nothing of her biological father, she said. 

While she claims she may be closer to related to the Winehouse family in some way, she does not want to upset them by pursuing her hunch. 

'It would just be a freak if Mitch was my father. I wouldn't want to rock anything as I am good friends with Mitch and Janis,' Ms Butler added.

Mitch and Janis Winehouse were guests at the performer's wedding and have attended several of her tribute gigs across London. 

She has been performing as an impersonator of the star for seven years.  

Amy Winehouse was found dead in her north London home in June 2011 following a lengthy battle with drug and alcohol addiction. 

The cause of the 27-year-old's death was given as alcohol poisoning at a second inquest, where it was heard the star had been watching videos of herself on YouTube and drinking vodka in her final hours.

Since her death her family has set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation, a charity which encourages recovering drug addicts and alcohols to share their experiences with young people in schools.

Earlier this year the taxi driver and singer revealed he spent time in the Camden flat where his daughter was found slumped on her bed. 

'This is the first place Amy bought when she got some money after her album Frank in 2004, and she lived here on and off for four years,' the 63-year-old said. 

'When she was struggling for money before her Back To Black album in 2006 she said, "Never sell the flat. I’m going to do a big album and we’re going to make lots of money."

'So obviously my ex-wife Janis, who co-owns it, and I will never sell it.'

Tributes left outside the singer's home in Camden, north London, following her untimely death in 2011

Miss Winehouse was just 27 when she was discovered dead in her flat by a security guard
