The last time Andy Murray tweeted to his 2.5million followers on June 14, he was proclaiming Nick Kyrgios as the ‘next big Aussie star’ after the 19-year-old won a Challenger on the grass of Nottingham.

The Wimbledon champion knows what he is talking about. Kyrgios, currently ranked No 144, yesterday sent out another sign that he is the real deal, ensuring that he will enter the top 100 as he fought back from a set down to beat Czech Jiri Vesely 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-2.

It sets up a mouthwatering fourth-round clash with Rafael Nadal tomorrow. As he has done so throughout these Championships, Kyrgios will come out firing with nothing to lose — and the world No 1 knows it.

‘He’s a young player, always there,’ said Nadal. ‘Young players are very dangerous as the young players always have something special. They are able to play with no pressure. It is good to have new players on tour. He has a great serve. He’s an aggressive player.’

The match on Court 17 between Kyrgios — the youngest man in the draw — and 20-year-old Vesely was billed as the battle of the upcoming young guns.

Kyrgios was sensational to watch and his statistics did the talking: 63 winners, 26 aces and 82 per cent of first serve points won.

‘Anything is possible,’ the youngster said afterwards. ‘I’m just going to go out there and play my game. I think that’s definitely enough to be competitive.’

Australia’s 12-year drought here is unlikely to end this year, but there is no doubt that this is a coming of age. Kyrgios is here to stay.
