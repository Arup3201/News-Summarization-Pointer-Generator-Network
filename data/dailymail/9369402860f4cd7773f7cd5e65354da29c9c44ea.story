French comedian Remi Gaillard has been accused of glorifying sex attacks with a video he posted online in which he appears to be simulating sex with unsuspecting women

A French comedian has been accused of glorifying sex attacks after posting a video online in which he appears to be simulating sex with unsuspecting women.

Remi Gaillard, 39, has provoked criticism for the 'air sex' video in which he uses careful camera angles to make it appear he is miming intercourse with women without their knowledge.

The online comedian however has defended the film, insisting all of the women involved gave their consent for the footage to be published and pointing out how the media is 'feasting' on the video.

The film has so far gained more than 4.5million views on YouTube, but former health minister Roselyne Bachelot described it as 'glorifying rape', The Independent reported.

Writer Dom Bochel Guegan wrote on the website of French magazine Nouvel Observateur that the video is a 'trivialisation of the sexual violence of which we have been or will be one day the victim of.'

She noted the response on Gaillard's Facebook page was mixed, with his defenders being 'very, very much guys, which is to say people who have never been solely considered as being a sexual object.'

Another viewer wrote in a tweet: 'Dear Remi Gaillard, keeping up rape culture is not funny. It's deplorable.'

French TV presenter Audrey Pulvar meanwhile called Mr Gaillard a 'miserable jerk' and said his film exploited the 'constant sexual aggression' faced by women in public.

Montpeiller-based Mr Gaillard, who has developed an international fanbase with his online films and pranks, produced a lengthy response to the criticism on his Facebook page, in which he said all the women in the film had given permission for the footage to be used.

He also points out one of the 'victims' in the video is a male police officer and pleads: 'Please let these women have the right to freedom of thought and the right to make use of their image as they see fit.'

He goes on to write: 'Women are not objects, and yet, the media is feasting on this humourous video.'

Gaillard started posting spoof videos to YouTube after losing his job working in a shoe shop and has become one of the most popular online comedians.
