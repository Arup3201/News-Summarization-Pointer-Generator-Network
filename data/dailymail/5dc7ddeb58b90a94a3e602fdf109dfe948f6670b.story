Protesters spent a third day camped out in Wisconsin Capitol building as they readied themselves to hear Governor Scott Walker's full budget proposal later today.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, quickly becoming a darling of Republicans across the country for his plan to take away most collective bargaining rights from public workers, will get another chance to bolster his national conservative credentials when he unveils the rest of his plan for dealing with the state's budget woes.

Walker's plan - set to be released Tuesday - will include deep cuts for schools and local governments to help close a projected $3.6 billion shortfall in the two-year budget.

Thinned out: Protester numbers were down yesterday, despite vows from organisers that more would join the sit in

Protest: Law enforcement officers forcibly remove a protester who was on a ledge of the state Capitol building

Stalemate: Protesters were asked to leave the building last night but many refused. Police have refused to unlock the entrances today because they are trying to prevent protesters from sleeping overnight in the building.

Protests in the Capitol building began on February 15, and by Sunday police had threatened to begin removing people after 4pm.

But with so many demonstrators ignoring the deadline to leave, they
 had no choice but to give in to the demands to stay.

After two weeks of massive protests, officials say there will be only limited access to the Capitol for Walker's budget address.

On Monday, police would not allow people to enter the building unless they were attending a public hearing or being escorted by lawmakers or their staff.

Police said they were trying to resolve conflicts with a handful of protesters who had refused to move to the ground floor of the building where demonstrators were being told to stay. Hundreds marched outside the Capitol.

President Barack Obama told U.S. state governors yesterday that everyone should be ready to sacrifice to help tackle the deficit.

But in a nod to the conflict between public sector unions and the governor in Wisconsin, Obama said it did not do anyone any good to 'denigrate' public employees.

Steadfast: Demonstrators have occupied building with a round-the-clock protest for the past 14 days protesting Governor Scott Walker's attempt to push through a bill that would restrict collective bargaining rights

Walker already has taken on President Barack Obama and Wisconsin's unions, a traditional Democratic stalwart. Before he even took office, Walker's opposition to high-speed rail resulted in the Obama administration taking back more than $800 million that had been awarded to the state.

Walker's plan also calls on state workers to contribute 5.8 percent of their salaries toward pensions and double their health insurance contribution beginning April 1.

Those changes would be expanded to nearly all other public workers, except those operating under existing union contracts, beginning July 1.

The higher benefit contribution would equate to an 8 percent pay decrease for the average worker. The state would save $30 million this fiscal year and $300 million over the next two years.

Walker said without those savings, 1,500 workers would have to be laid off between now and July and 12,000 state and local employees over the next two years.

Unions for teachers and state workers have said they would agree to the benefit concessions as long as they retain collective bargaining rights.

Staying put: Around 200 demonstrators, left, chant 'peaceful protest' and 'whose house is this? Our house'. While, right, others left peacefully after 14 days occupying the state Capitol building in Madison, Wisconsin

Labor leaders and Democratic lawmakers say Walker's proposal is intended to undermine unions and weaken a key Democratic voter base.

'He's not even conceding the fact that they've given them the money,' Democratic Senator Jon Erpenbach said in an interview in Chicago. 'He's threatening their livelihoods. He's treating them like poker chips.'

Walker has threatened that if the state doesn't pass his proposal by Tuesday, deeper cuts and layoffs would be required. Missing that deadline means the state won't be able to save $165 million through debt refinancing, Walker says.

On Friday, Wisconsin's state Assembly approved Walker's proposal to 
strip public sector unions of most collective bargaining rights.

The plan now needs state Senate approval, but Senate Democrats have fled Wisconsin to prevent a vote.

Over the weekend, there were solidarity rallies around the country 
with several thousand protesters gathering in New York City and Los 
Angeles.

About 1,000 people turned out in Chicago, Denver and Columbus, Ohio. 
Several hundred rallied in Austin, Texas, and about 100 people joined a 
demo in Miami.

Other states considering similar proposals to Wisconsin include Ohio, Tennessee, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa and Kansas.

The stakes are high for labour groups because more than a third of 
U.S. public employees, including teachers, police and civil service 
workers, belong to unions.

Police officers must plan what to do with the hundreds of protesters who were allowed an extra night in the building

Sleeping: The weary protesters will spend one more night in the state building

Teacher Raymond Wohl at the Chicago protest said: 'We bailed out 
Goldman Sachs, we bailed out Wall Street, we bailed out GM, but the hell
 with our teachers, our fire fighters, our nurses, our city workers, our
 state workers!

'I'm here because that's unjust, unfair,'

Doug Frank, 51, drove over three hours from his home in Crosby to attend the protest in Austin.

He said: 'What they're trying to do (in Wisconsin) is very heavy-handed; it's un-American.'

In New York, people waved signs reading 'Cut bonuses, not teachers,' 
'Unions make us strong,' and 'Wall St is destroying America,' and wore 
stickers that read 'We are all Wisconsin.'

Meanwhile, Mr Walker has vowed he will not climb down over his bill 
which would also require them to contribute more to health insurance and
 pensions.

He has warned that 10,000 state workers could lose their jobs if the bill is not passed.

On NBC's Meet the Press today, he said stripping the workers of 
collective bargaining rights was necessary to give the state the 
flexibility to get its finances in order.

He believed that some of the Democrat senators will return soon.
