Four years on and Katie Holmes was back on the Broadway stage on Monday night.

Reaction to her turn in Dead Accounts is yet to get going, but the actress certainly ensured she got back to work with a bang by sharing a steamy smooch with co-star Josh Hamilton.

In one scene, the 33-year-old actress is seen locking lips with the fellow Thespian and throwing her arms around him.

First night: Katie Holmes took to the stage on Monday evening for the preview opening night of her Broadway play Dead Accounts in New York

Passionate: The actress shared on  steamy clinch with co-star Josh Hamilton in one scene

Predictably, perhaps, gossipy reports 
have surfaced saying Hamilton - who is actually married to producer Lily
Thorne - has a 'crush' on Katie, according to the Daily News at least.

However, such talk has been laughed off by other publications, with the Chicago Sun-Times quoting a source brandishing the rumours as 'just more scandal press garbage'.

Katie looks like a girl next door in 
the stills released from her performance; she is wearing a casual 
ensemble of jeans, a purple top and floral cardigan, teamed with a pair 
of garish sneakers.

The mother-of-one is starring in the play as Lorna, alongside fellow co-stars Judy Greer, Jayne Houdyshell and Norbert Leo Butz.

Butz - a two-time Tony winner for Best Actor in a Musical - plays a con-man and Holmes's on-stage brother.

The play was written by Theresa Rebeck, the creator and former head-writer of the NBC musical series, Smash.

Putting on a show: The play was performed at the Music Box Theatre

It charts the story of a family and 
its prodigal son, who returns unexpectedly from New York to his hometown
of Cincinnati from New York.

Holmes put-upon character has been caring for their ailing parents during his absence.

The last time Katie was on Broadway was back in 2008, making her debut in a revival of Arthur Miller’s All My Sons.

Of course a lot has passed during that
time, especially so in the last year which has seen her divorce from 
her husband Tom Cruise.

Following her on-stage turn, Katie headed out to an after-party, pictured alongside her co-star Greer.

Earlier in the day the former Dawson's
Creek actress was spotted arriving to the New York's Music Box Theatre 
ahead of the press preview night.

Down to earth: Katie has also been spotted riding the Subway during her hectic day

How did it go? The actress was accompanied by her bodyguard as she walked through Times Square

Katie and Suri were recently forced to 
leave their luxury Chelsea apartment after superstorm 
Sandy left their building without  power or running water.

Holmes and six-year-old Suri have been staying at a midtown hotel close to the Music Box Theatre in recent days.

day! Katie fortified herself with coffee before arriving at the

Wintry: Katie looked focus on her big debut as she headed to work

Mother and daughter were said to have
stayed in her apartment at the Mercantile building during the storm 
last week before heading to the hotel.

A source close to the star told Page Six: 'Katie and Suri stayed safe and calm by torchlight.'

The Dead Accounts official opening night is scheduled for November 29.
