Dancing On Ice judge Jason Gardiner is swapping the showbiz 
circus for a real-life circus while the hit show is between series.

The
 brutally bitchy TV presenter is taking lessons at the National Centre 
for Circus Arts in London, learning swinging on ropes, tumbling and 
acrobatic moves.

The centre is a world-class training ground and the only place in Britain to offer a degree course in circus skills.

Dancing in the air: Jason Gardiner has joined the National Centre for Circus Arts, where he takes two to three classes a week, doing acrobatic tricks

Jason,
 42, attends two to three times a week, burning 500 to 600 calories an 
hour and developing his core and upper body strength  as well  as 
hand-eye co-ordination.

At least spending time on  the flying trapeze makes a change from flying into a rant at a celebrity  ice dancer.

Bottoms up? More people are getting drunk on mouthwash, a doctor reports

A US dentist nicknamed the Bad Breath Guru says people are drinking mouthwash as a cheap source of alcohol.

Dr Harold Katz tried to launch an alcohol-free mouthwash but was told by some UK chemists it wasn’t worth stocking.

‘I was told a significant amount of sales in these places were to those abusing mouthwash,’ he said.

Some Listerine mouthwashes are 26.9 per cent alcohol.

LACK
 of sleep – or too much  of it – could raise the risk of memory loss in 
later life.

Researchers looked at 15,263 female nurses of 70 or older.

The
 shift-workers who had slept five hours or less or nine hours or more 
had worse memory than women who slept for the same length of time each 
night.

The study at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts 
found an average of seven hours is best.

Women who have obesity surgery not only gain a new shape, they may acquire a different voice.

A
 third of the women found their voices become higher. Some patients also
 had a drop in loudness, according to research at the American 
University of Beirut.

It
 could be because loss  of weight associated with surgery has a slimming
 down effect on soft tissue in the back of the throat.

Symptoms of sleep
 apnoea, which involves soft tissue in the throat, were also reduced.
