Disturbing: Frederick Hengl, 68, is accused of killing, dismembering and cooking his wife, Anna Faris, at their California home

A 68-year-old California man accused of killing and dismembering his wife was cooking her flesh and bones at the time police officers came to arrest him, according to officials.

Police said they responded to neighbors' complaints about a foul odor coming from the home of Frederick Hengl and his wife, 73-year-old Anna Faris, in Oceanside on Friday.

An officer who entered the home through a window said he saw on the stove three pans containing what later turned out to be the remains of the elderly woman. Her severed head was discovered in the freezer.

Deputy District Attorney Katherine Flaherty said there is no evidence of cannibalism at this time, Fox 8 San Diego reported..

Hengl pleaded not guilty to a slew of
charges on Wednesday, among them first-degree murder, willful cruelty 
to an elder and committing an unlawful act with human remains. He faces 
25 years to life in prison if convicted.

At around 11.10am last Friday, 
officers responded to a report of an unbearable smell coming from 
Hengl's home in the 400 block of North Ditmar street.

Since no one was home at the time, 
they climbed through the window and observed what appeared to be meat 
cooking in several pans on the stove.

Grisly find: The dismembered body of a 74-year-old woman was found in this Oceanside, California home on Friday morning with the woman's husband arrested on suspicion of murder

Unusual couple: Neighbours of the couple say they were extremely strange with the victim frequently seen with her pants down on the street while holding a knife and her husband seen cross dressing

Police found the 68-year-old man, 
described by neighbors as a notorious cross-dresser, at a nearby bar and
after interviewing him realized that Hengl was in the process of 
dismembering his wife's body, according to law enforcement officials.

Flaherty said officers opened the 
freezer to discover Faris' head severed at the top of the cervical 
vertebrae wrapped in a bag. A meat grinder was 'in use' nearby.

When they entered the bathroom, 
investigators found a work bench with a saw and boning knife, along with
other cutting instruments. They also came across a plastic bag filled 
with chunks of freshly cut bone. 

Prosecutors believe Hengl killed his 
wife on or between the dates of November 1 and 16. Neighbors told 
reporters that they had not seen the woman in about a month and had 
heard the sounds of a power saw from the couple’s two-bedroom bungalow 
style home about two weeks ago.

Several neighbors said Faris had been
behaving strangely since last spring, walking around with pants around 
her ankles, rarely bathing, carrying a butcher knife and telling 
strangers things like 'God will smite you.'

Gruesome sight: Entering the home police wearing masks discovered what remained of Mrs Hengl whom they said had been dead for at least one day

Tipped off: Next-door neighbour Erick Chavez, 21, said he alerted authorities after a horrible smell poured from the home for the last week and a half

‘My neighbor was just telling me 
she'd chase her down the street with a knife or she'd have her clothes 
off, pants down; you could tell she was a little bit out of it,’ neighbor Brett Lord told 10News.

'She'd
stand there, feed the birds, talk to folks walking by and her pants 
would fall. She didn't seem to notice, ever,' neighbor Jerry Parnell 
told 10News.

Her husband, however, also has gained notoriety around town for dressing up in women's clothing and wearing makeup.

In one instance a neighbor described
seeing him wearing a floor-length purple dress coupled with a long 
pearl necklace and earrings. In his hand he held a purse, reports UT San Diego.

‘He would cross-dress and you almost couldn't recognize the guy,’ Mr Parnell said.

Police
say there are no previous reports of domestic violence from the home 
though neighbours said they had made calls on Mrs Hengl in the past.

'About a week and a half ago, I noticed a pretty gross smell,' next-door neighbor Erick Chavez, 21, told NBC San Diego.

By Friday morning, it had grown absolutely unbearable he said, prompting him to report it.

Entering the home police discovered what remained of Faris whom they said had been dead for at least one day.

Arrested
outside a downtown bar was her 68-year-old husband with police 
questioning neighbors on possible power tools or heavy machinery heard 
coming from the home as of late.

'I just thought somebody was working in their garage,' neighbor Nancy Wells, one of several who confirmed such sounds told CBS8.

In addition to the loud sounds, Mr Chavez said Hengl had shown a particular attachment to his trash cans as of late.

Odd behaviour: Mr Chavez said that in addition to hearing power tools as of late, the victim's husband Frederick Hengl was seen frequently carrying his trash cans to and from the house, the backyard seen

'The
man was taking his trash cans back and forth,' Mr Chavez told News10. 
'He’s been going around the block, up and around, taking pieces of her 
and putting them in the trash; going around the block? I don't know,' he
guessed.

The 68-year-old suspect remains 
jailed on $5million bail. On Wednesday, he appeared frail in court, and 
his lawyer requested he see jail medical staff for a heart condition, according to UT San Diego.
