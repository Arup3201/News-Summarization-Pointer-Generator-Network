A man returned home from three days working offshore to discover his estranged wife holed up with another man and the makings of a meth lab at their former marital home in Marrero, Louisiana.

Grant Williams, 33, told deputies he was surprised to be greeted by ex-wife Kelly Williams, 32, at his Savannah Lane home when he returned on Friday afternoon.

Grant said his suspicions grew after she was uncommonly affectionate towards him, according to a Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office arrest and incident report.

The man told police that he sensed his wife was trying to keep him away from the bedroom and he soon discovered why when he found a strange man, Stephen Hamilton, 43, of Metairie, standing in the shower.

The husband also found drug paraphernalia and several plastic bags containing an off-white powder in his bed - that investigators have determined was methamphetamine.

The husband told deputies he immediately suspected the bags contained drugs because his wife had been arrested in February in connection with the discovery of another meth lab.

Hamilton fled the scene but was quickly caught by deputies, after Grant Williams called the police, reports nola.com.
