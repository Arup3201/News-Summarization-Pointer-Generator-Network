The quest for the perfect selfie has led one California park to become overrun with thousands of hikers who are eroding the trails and overwhelming paramedics with emergency calls for dehydration and sprained ankles. 

Mission Peak in Fremont, California used to be a quiet park a few years ago, but ever since the rise of social media, the mountain peak has become a destination for inexperienced hikers looking to take pictures of the view and pose by the summit pole. 

'Some days it's like a rock concert,' East Bay Regional Park Supervisor Gordon Willey told SFGate. 'Ten years ago this was just a quiet little park. But now, with social media, for some reason, it's just blowing up.'

The view from above: Local officials estimate that 3,000 people make the trek up Mission Peak in Fremont on busy weekends, which is much more than the 500 it's designed to host

However, the trail is certainly not easy for those who are not used to the workout. It's three miles long up 2,000 feet, and no shade along the way to take breaks on 90-degree summer days.

On busy weekends, health officials estimate that they are called to the trail to treat four or five people, usually suffering from twisted ankles, dehydration or heat stroke. 

And many bring their pets. Last summer, five dogs tragically died climbing up the peak with their masters. 

'There's no shade, and no water, and sometimes people overestimate their abilities. They get halfway up and then we get a phone call,' said district police Lt Lance Brede. 'It pulls our resources away from other things.'

Dangerous: There is no shade to take a break out of the sun on the way up the trail. Last summer, five dogs died walking up the peak with their masters

Problems: Local officials are thinking of charging parking on the weekends and taking the summit pole down to curb the peak's popularity 

Other issues include people taking shortcuts off the trail, leading to erosion on the mountain side. Neighbors are also complaining about the serious traffic up and down the trail. On weekends, the peak can average 3,000 visitors a day when the park is really only designed to accommodate 500 people at most.

The mountain keeps getting more and more popular, with many looking to pose on the grafittied summit pole. 

'That's why we're here. We want to take Facebook pictures,' Sidney Salenga, a chef from San Jose, told the Gate before his ascent on Wednesday. 'I saw some people posted pictures from the very top, and I thought, I want to go there.' 

To combat the growing problem of traffic on the trail, local authorities have started enforcing a curfew and have put up signs at the trailhead, warning hikers to bring water and proper shoes. 

They are also considering charging parking fees on the weekend and removing the pole from the summit, where several people have posed for their pictures.
