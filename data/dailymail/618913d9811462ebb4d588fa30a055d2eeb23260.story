This is the moment a schoolboy carried out a light-hearted prank – and found himself at the centre of a police investigation.

Year 13 pupil Jacob Dowdle lies in wait for his head of year, a custard pie in hand.

It was the last day of term at Altrincham Grammar, when pupils are allowed to take playful revenge on their teachers who laugh it off and join in the fun.

Prank: Jacob Dowdle moves backwards towards his female teacher with the custard pie in his hand

Impact: Dowdle pushes the face into his victim's face as a friend films the prank on his mobile phone

Aftermath: The teacher wipes the custard pie from her face, while still being filmed. After the incident, Dowdle was expelled from the school and quizzed by police

But when Jacob slapped the custard pie
 – actually a plate of whipped cream – in the teacher’s face he did not 
get the reaction from her he was expecting.

She
 reported him and a week later the 18-year-old was hauled to a police 
station for questioning on suspicion of common assault.

After being questioned by
Greater Manchester Police about his behaviour, he was told to apologise to the
teacher, Laura Barratt, 54.

 

In trouble: Jacob Dowdle, 18, has been expelled from school and grilled by cops for throwing a custard pie at his teacher's face

But
 after a video of the prank was posted on Facebook, Jacob was expelled 
and allowed to return only to sit his A-Level exams.

Part of the reason 
for his expulsion was that he would not reveal who posted the footage 
online.

Fearing for his 
university and job prospects, the star pupil has now launched an online 
petition begging to be allowed back.

The campaign has been backed by 
comedian Jason Manford and attracted more than 750 signatures.

Writing
 on the petition, Jacob said: ‘During the last day of school – where it 
is tradition to prank teachers – I pranked my head of year by pieing 
them in the face with the traditional combination of a paper plate with 
whipped cream on it; all as a prank and with no harm intended.

‘Other
 teachers had been victims of pranks throughout the day so I thought 
mine would go down in the same manner. The school treated the prank as 
“common assault” and pursued to punish myself by means of contacting the
 police.

‘There were other 
pranks throughout the day, for example a student threw a water balloon 
at a teacher and it exploded all over them. They went completely 
unpunished.’

Furious teachers failed to see the funny side 
and reported Jacob to the police before expelling him after finding a 
video of the incident online

Jacob Dowdle, 18, was celebrating his last day of lessons when he grabbed the paper plate topped with whipped cream and threw it at the schoolmistress

Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, in Cheshire where Jacob Dowdle 'slapped' a female teacher's face with a custard pie during an end-of-term prank

Speaking to the Mail, Jacob said he regretted the prank but claimed the school’s response had been ‘disproportionate’.

‘Mrs
 Barratt came out and the opportunity arose, my friends were egging me 
on, so I just did it,’ he said. ‘But we’re not the best of  friends, 
she’s just not got a sense of humour when it comes to me. I think that’s
 why they’ve taken it that far.  If it was another pupil she liked she 
would have reacted completely differently.’

Jason Manford has retweeted Jacob’s petition, calling the pie attack ‘p*** funny’.

Two days after the incident Jacob, 18, was expelled by his school after a video of the pie attack was posted on Facebook

But the school maintains the incident on May 16 was a ‘planned assault’ on a teacher.

Head
 Tim Gartside said: ‘Like many schools we like to mark the end of Year 
13 and students have enjoyed clever, tasteful, and original pranks that 
have neither harmed nor humiliated.

‘Jacob Dowdle’s behaviour was not
 a prank.

‘His slapping of a teacher in the face was a planned assault.’

He said the school would always take a firm stance against students who assaulted staff.
