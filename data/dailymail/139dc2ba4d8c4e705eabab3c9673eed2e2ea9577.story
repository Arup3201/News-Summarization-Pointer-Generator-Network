Ever dreamed of enrolling at an international university in less than half an hour? Drop in at the French Embassy, Shanti Path, this weekend, and you could be the lucky one.

The two-day Campus France Admission Tour 2012 opens on Saturday with the promise to offer admission to the brightest students in just 20 minutes - and the good news is that knowledge of French is not mandatory to make the grade.

Campus France is a public policy initiative of the French government to promote higher education abroad and the Admission Tour 2012 will see as many as 25 top French institutions hitting the road (from Delhi they'll got to Bangalore and Mumbai) to spot the right candidates and make admission offers to them.

Candidates will be selected on the basis of their academic merit and indepth interviews by the visiting university officials. 'We have plenty of options for every student, from engineering to management, language studies to hospitality,' says Bedojyoti Bhattacharjee, National Coordinator, Campus France India.

Though in the public eye France is famous for its haute fashion and gastronomy, the admission tour will focus on the strengths of French institutions in such specialist areas as nanotechnology, aeronautics, embedded systems, water management and pure sciences.

'France has achievements to show in a number of little-known but important areas and we want to promote them,' says Renaud Viley, Deputy Attaché for University Cooperation at the Embassy of France in India.

'The French institutions sending their top officials to India are keen on recruiting the best Indian students to enhance their intellectual capital,' Viley adds.

To make the invitation sweeter, the attaché points out that most of the management, business and technical programmes in French institutions of higher learning are conducted in English.

Students also can avail of a number of higher education scholarships offered by the French government via the embassy. 'We give away 362 scholarships in 2011,' says Viley. 'This year too we will disburse around the same number of scholarships.'

Campus France expects around 300 students from the Capital to attend the recruitment drive. And similar numbers in Mumbai and Bangalore before the delegation heads back to France on February 13.

'We will consider our mission to be a success if we manage to recruit at least 200 students from India by the end of this tour,' Viley says. Watch this space to see if they have done it.

Asia is not the same as before. It is today defined by the rise of India and China. Singapore recognises this fact. There is also a broad spectrum of quality educational institutions now in India. It is no longer just the IITs. It also helps us that India is actively pursuing a Look East policy.

Yes, it has. Five years ago I used to visit India only once a year on behalf of my university. Now I visit India at least six times a year. I find that the overall quality of the education infrastructure in the country has improved over the years.

Brain drain is not something that has to be viewed in bad way. People who live and work abroad are the unofficial ambassadors of the country. The best way to handle the issue is by engaging with the Diaspora.

Singapore has over 30,000 international students on its campuses. Of these, 5 to 10 per cent are Indian students. Engineering is a perennial favourite of Indian students, followed by Management. The universities also offer full scholarships to meritorious students.

India is moving on the right track, but we have a lot of catching up to do. We need to keep pace with the rest of the world.

As part of Australia's largest ever trade mission in India, government of Victoria has invited six universities to join the trade mission. The Vice Chancellors that are joining the trade mission include VCs Margaret Gardner from RMIT University, Jane Den Hollander from Deakin University, John Dewar from La Trobe University, and Linda Kristjanson from Swinburne University, while the University of Melbourne, Victoria University and University of Ballarat will be sending their senior delegates.

Moving up: Six universities, including Deakin, will join the largest-ever trade delegation from Australia

Education being one of largest exports of Victoria, and having these universities taking part in the mission would help the state to enhance its reputation as a centre for world-class higher education.

Big investment: Deakin's Country Director-India, Ravneet Pawha said the university invest $4million in research projects

Deakin University is going to continue to focus on research and academic collaborations during the mission. Deakin University founded its India office 15 years ago, and since then it has established 50 corporate partnership and around 14 academic collaborations.

'We will soon finish the Deakin-India Initiative that was stated four years ago. Under this Initiative, Deakin University made an investment of $4 million for four years in various research areas. Thirty PhD students based in India and enrolled at Deakin University are soon going to complete their programmes,' briefed Ravneet Pawha, Country Director-India, Deakin University.

Professor Peter Hodgson, who has been instrumental in establishing partnerships in India, has travelled to India 50 times in the last five years. Talking about what would be the major areas of research that Deakin University is going to focus on in coming years, he said, 'In last few years we have worked in the fields of IT, engineering, biotechnology, biofuels and eye diseases.

'We will continue our work in these areas but public health, agricultural biotechnology and nanotechnology are other major fields we are looking at,' adding, 'Deakin is also setting up a research centre at TERI with a co-investment of $8-10 million.'

Among various programmes that Deakin University offers, engineering, MBA, Film and Video Production are the sought-after degrees from the University.

Deakin University has quite a good number of scholarships that it offers to International students, which again makes it a favourable choice for international students.
