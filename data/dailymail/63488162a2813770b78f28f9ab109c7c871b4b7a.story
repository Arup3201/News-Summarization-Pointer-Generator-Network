A former tabloid reporter walked free from court yesterday after he was cleared of illegally accessing celebrity text messages.

Ben Ashford, 35, was accused of trawling through racy exchanges between a married BBC star and a high profile PR agent.

Prosecutors claimed he knew an iPhone which contained the messages was stolen and he did not have permission to view the material.

The jury at the Old Bailey took less than five hours to clear former Sun reporter Ben Ashford, 35, of illegally accessing text messages during hacking trial

But a jury took fewer than five hours to throw out the case against him and bring to an end his two year ordeal.

The verdict is a blow for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Metropolitan Police which were accused of acting with ‘messianic zeal’.

Prosecutors face questions over why it was necessary to use one of the country’ s most senior QCs to prosecute two relatively minor offences.

Previous cases led by Peter Wright QC include the prosecution of serial killer Harold Shipman, corrupt cop Ali Dizaei and the airline liquid bomb plotters.

Police must also explain why it was necessary to subject Mr Ashford to a criminal inquiry two years after the phone theft in 2009.

The woman who stole the phone, who was only identified thanks to information provided by The Sun newspaper, was simply handed a caution.

The five-day case also left taxpayers with a hefty bill, it costs an estimated £30,000 a day to put on cases at the Old Bailey, the UK’s top criminal court.

The acquittal follows the not guilty verdicts in the cases of former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks after a seven month trial.

Mr Ashford looked relieved as the jury pronounced its ‘not guilty’ verdicts on the two charges in the five-day trial yesterday.

He was the first journalist charged under Operation Tuleta, the investigation into alleged criminal breaches of privacy and computer hacking.

The jury had heard how Ashford had been handed the phone when he was working for The Sun in October 2009 in Manchester.

He was told to investigate claims that the celebrity had been cheating on his long-term partner and spent hours trawling its contents.

He wrote a lengthy memo and returned the iPhone the next day when he realised it was stolen after its owner, a PR agent, posted a message online about the theft.

Mr Ashford was interviewed as a witness, not a suspect, the next month. Three years later he was arrested after News International handed a dossier of emails to police.

The information included the 18-page memo written by Mr Ashford detailing his findings on the phone. No story was ever published.

In court, Mr Ashford said the device had no security code and he suspected the situation was a ruse to leak the story without it being traced back to the woman.

His barrister, Orlando Pownall (LEGAL_INSERT)QC(LEGAL_INSERT), said his client was a victim of an over-zealous prosecution that pursued an inappropriate case against him with ‘messianic zeal’.

The jury cleared Mr Ashford of possession of criminal property and an offence under the Computer Misuse Act.

Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Ashford said: ‘I’m immensely relieved that the jury have reached a just verdict.

‘I’d like thank my family, friends, and my legal team for their unwavering support, and my thoughts remain with my friends and former colleagues who face a similar ordeal.’

His father Frazer added: ‘I’m just so relieved that justice has been done.’
