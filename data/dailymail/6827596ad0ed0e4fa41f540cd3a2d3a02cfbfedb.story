Claudia Fragapane made English sporting history with a fourth gold medal of these Games here at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday and then dissolved in a fit a giggles when asked what it meant.

‘I’m speechless, I cannot believe it,’ said the 16-year-old gymnast from Bristol, who is 4ft 6in tall but has gone from being largely unknown to a giant of achievement within just a few days.

Her gold on the floor on Friday followed others in the individual all-round and team all-round finals, and the vault. 

Quadruple: England's Claudia Fragapane won her fourth gold medal of the Commonwealth Games on Friday

Glory: The 16-year-old (centre) added the women's individual floor event to her other three titles

To put these medals in context, no other English woman, in any sport, has ever won four golds at a single Commonwealth Games before.

Only one other English woman, in any sport, has ever won more than four Games golds in an entire sporting career, and that person’s career ended with every conceivable gong in global sport, from European and world titles to Olympic gold.

The woman in question was hurdler Sally Gunnell and it took her three Commonwealth Games to win her five Games golds between 1986 and 1994.

Fragapane was born in 1997 and says she fell in love with gymnastics in 2003. ‘I was six years old,’ she said. ‘I was so bubbly, jumping all over the house and my mum wanted to get me doing something. Straightaway I just loved it, I liked the determination you needed and I wanted to progress.

‘Gymnastics is about needing to love it and going for it 100 per cent… the fact is I can just express myself and go wild, because I’m so bouncy and everything, it’s just great.’ 

Jumping high: Fragapane's score of 14.541 was enough for her to claim her fourth gold medal of the Games

Fragapane had a grin from ear to ear and a spring in her step during a floor routine that scored 14.541, well clear of Australia’s Lauren Mitchell and Elsabeth Black of Canada in the silver and bronze positions.

‘The floor does let you show your personality,’ said the teenager. ‘My floor routine is very bubbly and hip-hoppy.’

Before deeming any British gymnastic success a barometer of global potential, it should be stressed China remain dominant in this sport. But Fragapane now has a world top-three finish in her sights at October’s world championships in Nanning, China. ‘I’m expecting to get to the floor final at the worlds and then hopefully get in the top three,’ she said.

She added it was ‘really good’ to be part of a revolution in British gymnastics that has shown every sign here of making solid progress from the advances made at the London Games.

England’s final medals tally in the gymnastics was nine golds, five silvers and five bronzes to leave them top of the table ahead of Canada in second place (8-3-4) with Scotland in third (2-2-1).

In the artistic events, England won five of the six women’s disciplines, with English men (four golds) and Scottish men (two) taking six of the eight men’s titles.

England’s Max Whitlock (below)had been hoping for a fourth gold of these Games yesterday but had to settle for a bronze in the parallel bars. The gold was won to rapturous applause by Scotland’s Merseyside-born Dan Purvis, with Nile Wilson of Leeds taking silver. 

Routine: Fragapane has already won gold in the individual all-around, vault and the team events in Glasgow

Wilson, 18, at his first major senior competition following a glittering junior career, then went one better on the parallel bars to take gold, scoring the same world-class points total as England team-mate Kristian Thomas (14.966) but pipping him with a better technical mark. Thomas had earlier won a vault silver behind Scott Morgan of Canada.

There is an exuberance and camaraderie now between all the British gymnasts that suggests they can make an impact at Olympic level in Rio.

Whitlock insisted that these Games are a significant point in the gymnastics calendar en route to that goal.

‘It’s a massive competition for us,’ he said. ‘It’s a big stepping stone and our main job is to go out and get big scores. The judging is still the same, whatever the competition.’

On the promise of Wilson, he added: ‘It’s his first Commonwealth Games and he’s come out here and performed like a true senior and fitted into the group really well. Three Brits on the podium (in the parallel bars) is massive for us. P-bars aren’t our strongest piece in British gymnastics and yet we’ve just got three scores of 15 and over.

‘That’s a massive statement to the rest of the world and hopefully we can go and do that on the world stage.

‘Nile is a very confident young lad and that’s a good thing, he loves the crowd and that all helps him, he handles the pressure.’

Purvis, whose mother is from Dundee and whose father is from Sheffield, said: ‘I didn’t really expect to get the gold. Just to get a medal would have been fantastic. I’m just absolutely over the moon.’
