A 79-year-old man died after a nurse mistakenly gave him a drug used in state executions rather than an over-counter medicine.

Richard Smith was admitted to hospital in Miami, Florida, after complaining of stomach pains and shortness of breath.

The former teacher was prescribed Pepcid, an over-the-counter antacid, to try and cure the problem.

But nurse Uvo Ologboride picked up a vial of Pancuronium from a locked drug cart and injected it into the former teacher's IV tube.

The drug is given to death row inmates being put to death.

It is a muscle relaxant that forms part of the three injections used in state executions. The drug is also used in operating rooms.

An investigation by officials at the North Shore Medical Centre found that Mr Smith was left alone for 30 minutes after being given the wrong drug.

Mr Smith, a father-of-four, was resuscitated but never recovered, and died weeks later.

An investigation into the incident in July 2010 revealed the nurse on duty failed to read the label, failed to scan the medication and failed to scan Mr Smith's patient ID bracelet.

Officials said this would have alerted the nurse of the mistake before it happened.

A report also said the nurse failed to follow safeguards on a drug dispensing cart to prevent these types of incidents.

Details of the mix up were revealed by the Smith family as they filed a lawsuit against the Florida hospital.

The victim's son Marc said he arrived at the hospital to be told about the mix up by a doctor.

Marc recalled the doctor said: 'I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but the nurse administered the wrong medication.'

‘I said: “How could that happen, didn't he read it?” He said: “The nurse said the package looked the same”,’ Marc added.

Lawyers for the family said the mix up was made worse because the nurse left Mr Smith alone for 30 minutes.

‘It's one thing to make a mistake. It's another thing to make the mistake and walk away from it and leave this man unattended for 30 minutes and come back and find him cold and blue,’ said attorney Andrew Yaffa, who is representing the Smith family.

A spokesman for the hospital said an internal review has since been carried out to prevent a repeat of the drugs mix up.

‘Our hearts go out to the Smith family for their loss. This was a tragic event that was immediately self-reported to the Agency for Health Care Administration.

‘We conducted an internal review and have several new processes in place to ensure a situation like this doesn't happen again,’ a North Shore spokesman said.

The hospital said they had removed all Pancuronium from nursing areas except for the operating room.

A new packaging system was also set up
in the hospital with the vial placed in a sealed bag with a clear a 
warning on the outside.

The nurse responsible for the mix up still works at the hospital. She was fined $2,800, reprimanded and had to attend a re-training course.

Mr Smith's widow Lula and her husband had been married 55 years and as well as four children of their own had raised 10 foster children.

Her daughter Vickie Jackson said they are still searching for answers and hope another family will not have to endure the pain of losing a loved one the way they did.

'I'm mad because it seems like you can take a life, and you don't have to answer for it,’ she said.
