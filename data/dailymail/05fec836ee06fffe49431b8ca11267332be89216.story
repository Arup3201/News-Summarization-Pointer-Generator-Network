Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny might be feeling slightly sorry for himself, having been dropped to the bench by Arsene Wenger.

However the Pole might be pleased to know he has been voted Championship side Brentford’s top goalkeeper of the past decade, having made just 28 appearances for the Bees back in 2009-10 on loan from the Gunners.

Brentford ran the week-long poll on Twitter to mark ten years of the Football League Awards, which will find a ‘Team of the Decade’ to mark the occasion.

Each club, including Brentford who are currently sixth in the Championship, nominate up to four players to go forward to the judges; one goalkeeper, one defender, one midfielder and one forward.

The award could soften the blow for Szczesny that he has lost his place to David Ospina in the Arsenal net following a series of errors and then angering Arsene Wenger by smoking in the showers after their 2-0 defeat to Southampton on New Year’s Day.

Ospina has impressed with a string of strong displays as the Arsenal No 1 with four clean sheets in six games and conceding just three goals.

Meanwhile since the costly defeat at Southampton, Szczesny has featured just once in the 3-2 FA Cup victory at Brighton.

It remains to be seen whether the Pole will start against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup at the Emirates this Sunday, as he aims to wrestle back the starting role.
