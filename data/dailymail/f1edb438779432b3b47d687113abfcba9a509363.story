In the aftermath of the fiery New York train crossing wreck last week, witnesses described the bravery of one unidentified man who held open the doors for passengers to flee while his own hands were on fire.

They said that despite his hair and hands being ablaze the man buttressed the exit as the carriage burned inside and that when he could stand the pain no more he jumped down and shoved his hands into the snow to extinguish them.

That man, Patrick Izzo, 29, is now recovering in Westchester Medical Center from second-degree burns to his hands and also injuries to his face and leg from the crash which killed six and injured 15.

Hero: Patrick Izzo is pictured here by his sister as he sits up in bed and chows down on a well deserved meal of burgers, fries and a cheese board

His sister, Sally Izzo, told KHOU that her family keep telling the business entrepreneur that he is a hero, but that he modestly denies this.

'He says he did what his instincts told him to do,' said Sally. 'He's doing well. He's definitely in a lot of pain.'

Pictured, sitting up in bed and indulging in his favorites of burger and fries and a cheese plate, Patrick is facing more treatment for his burns.

He described to his sister the terrifying instant when the Metro-North train struck the SUV of a New York mother-of-three, who had become stuck between a railroad crossing on February 3.

Sally said that her brother 'felt a big jolt' when the train hit the car and the impact was so strong he feared the train was going to derail.

Acting instinctively, Patrick stood in the aisle to prepare himself but the train ignited when the third rail ripped through the car.

Patrick said that in that moment he fell and then stood to find his hands, hair and his shirt were ablaze.

Sally Izzo said that her brother knew he had to get off the train and with his hands burning he cracked open the emergency box with his elbow and opened the latch to get the exit doors open.

He then held it open for survivors to jump out. 'He always pays attention to where the emergency boxes are,' said Sally. 'He's just one of those people.'

His bravery did not end there. Once he had put his hands out he tried to shout up to other passengers on boards the train, but he couldn't do much more because of his wounds.

'He said people had severed limbs,' said Sally Izzo. 'It was a disaster.'

And yesterday, the medical examiner in New York announced that all six people killed in the railroad crossing collision died from blunt force trauma and burns.

A brief statement released by Westchester County did not specify the cause of death for any of the victims.

It also did not specify whether the blunt-force injuries were caused by the impact inside the train on the tracks or by the pieces of third rail that speared into both vehicles during the February 3 accident.

The collision killed five men on a Metro-North evening commuter train and a mother-of-three, Ellen Brody, 49, whose Mercedes SUV was hit by the train at a grade crossing in Valhalla.

Morgan Stanley employee Aditya Tomar, 41, banker Eric Vandercar, 53, Met museum art curator Walter Liedtke, 69, research scientist Robert Dirks, 36, and Joseph B. Nadol, 42, of Ossining were also killed in the crash

A fire erupted, apparently fueled by the SUV's gasoline, and 12 sections of the railroad's electrified rail pierced the SUV and the train car.

The findings were based on autopsies conducted by the office of the county medical examiner, Dr. Kunjlata Ashar, the county said.

The statement said Ashar's final report and conclusions will not be completed until the National Transportation Safety Board finishes its investigation several months from now.
