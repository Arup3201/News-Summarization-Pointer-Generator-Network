They are more used to spending their nights out on the tiles.

But prolific party-goer Kate Moss, fellow supermodel Naomi Campbell and rocker Noel Gallagher, 47, have agreed to stay in and watch TV for charity.

The trio are taking part in a special celebrity Gogglebox sketch to raise money for Channel 4’s Stand Up To Cancer fundraiser.

The hit reality TV series which launched in 2013 features a selection of families and couples watching television at home and commenting on the programmes they view together.

Only on October 17 those watching the TV programmes selected and sharing their opinions with the viewers at home will be a little more glamorous.

Moss normally refrains from commenting in public so for many viewers at home this will be the first time they will hear her speak.

The 40-year-old mother-of-one is said to have agreed to take part as she is a fan of the programme and enjoys watching Bake Off and X Factor and is also partial to the US sitcom Modern Family.

Miss Campbell, 44, who will next star in US TV drama Empire is glued to American show Housewives of Atlanta.

Last night a source said: ‘The sketch will help to raise money for charity and Kate is good friends with Noel and Naomi. When she knew she would have them by her side she did not hesitate to agree.

‘Kate likes watching TV and is a fan of Googlebox, Bake Off and X Factor.’

Moss and Campbell,who both grew up in London, have been firm friends since the 1990s as they flew around the world modelling and often found themselves working together.

Describing their enduing friendship which has spanned 25 years, and providing an indication of what viewers can expect when they tune in to watch the sketch, Campbell has said in the past: ‘What’s Kate like? Well, she’s honest, loyal and straightforward. 

'There’s no bullshit. She’s not pretentious in any way. What you see is what you get. I love that about her. After all, we’re both from south London — I’m from Streatham, she’s from Croydon — and from working-class families. She’s never tried to be anything else and nor have I. We know our roots.’

Moss and Gallagher became friends following the success of Oasis during the 1990s Britpop era.

Googlebox launched on screens in 2013 and became the surprise hit of the year and has been equally as successful this year.

The show regularly sets Twitter alight as viewers are bowled over with its depiction of ordinary folks and the dynamics of their relationships and family lives.

The format has been sold all over the world, with American and Chinese broadcasters first in the queue to snap up the show.
