A defiant Roberto Martinez is refusing to curb Everton’s attacking style despite rumblings of discontent over his management at Goodison Park.

The Spaniard masterminded a fifth-placed finish in his first season on Merseyside, but he has seen Everton slump to 12th position this term after losing five of their last seven Premier League games.

Martinez’s side have leaked 31 league goals so far this campaign - only eight fewer than in the whole of last season.

Toffees boss Roberto Martinez has seen his side make 10 errors leading to goals already this season

ROSS BARKLEY: Midfielder hasn’t made the same explosive start to this season as he did in 2013. Granted, he has played six fewer games than at this time last season, but he has one goal from 13 shots, compared to three goals and 35 shots last year.

SEAMUS COLEMAN: Right-back is suffering at both ends of the pitch this season. He has made 27 tackles (38 this time last term) and 575 passes (729 in 2013-14), but it is the five goals (two this season) and 15 shots (seven this season) that have been sorely missed.

ROMELU LUKAKU: Since his big-money move, the striker has yet to hit the heights of last season. At this stage last term he had nine goals and a 25 per cent chance conversion rate - this season it’s six and 15.3 per cent. Also, he has been flagged offside 20 times (nine at this stage last season).

There are understood to be concerns around the club and even in the dressing-room that the manager’s commitment to attacking football is leaving Everton exposed at the back, and there is little compromise to be found in Martinez’s single-minded approach.

‘You don’t win games by changing the style,’ said Martinez ahead of Thursday's trip to Hull City. ‘Changing only brings doubts. I’ve been in this situation too many times.

‘Maybe when I was a young manager starting out, you would start thinking about (changing style) after a run like this but it is very clear - in football you need to be outstanding at what you do. It’s not good enough to be average.

‘Are we going to concede goals? Of course we are. Are we going to lose games? Of course we are. But it’s important we know the way we want to play and that is never, ever going to be changed. Our style is very clear. It was very successful last season, giving us the biggest points tally in the Premier League in the history of our football club.

‘I’m very much aware of the needs of the British game. I have been here long enough and I’m not someone who works in percentages. I don’t work on having a good defensive record to win things.

‘We work on other aspects and I like to have the talent that wins football games and try to build something that will allow the club to compete against sides that have spent a huge amount of money.

‘The players know what we are doing. We’re stronger than ever. We know where we want to go and how we are going to get there. I will allow the results to speak for themselves.’

Martinez is aware of the criticism after Everton conceded three goals at Southampton and Newcastle United. But he is not about to let the pundits alter his way of thinking. ‘When you concede the kind of cheap goals we did against Southampton and Newcastle then you are going to get those comments,’ he added.

‘But the pundits are only assessing those two games, they haven’t got the deep information from watching that team over 18 months. That’s part of the manager’s job.

‘I’m probably the most open manager in the league. I don’t think anyone would have a conversation this open. I’m always open to other opinions, but the reality is I know what out football style is. It’s not about listening to opinions.’

There was more bad news for Everton on Tuesday when it was confirmed that goalkeeper Tim Howard will be out for up to six weeks with the calf injury he sustained against Stoke City. The setback will almost certainly force Martinez into the transfer market next month, with Spaniard Joel Robles the only other senior keeper on the books.

The Everton boss admitted centre backs Phil Jagielka and John Stones are unlikely to recover from ankle injuries in time to face Hull, while James McCarthy’s troublesome hamstring will continue to be monitored.

Martinez, a qualified physiotherapist, is known to be concerned that Everton players have suffered 18 hamstring or soft-tissue injuries in as many months, and it was confirmed on Tuesday that the club’s highly-respected head of medicine Daniel Donachie has left Goodison.
