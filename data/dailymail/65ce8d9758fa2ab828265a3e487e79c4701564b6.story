A grandmother in Chicago is being charged with the murder of her 8-year-old granddaughter after firefighters discovered the girl dead at her home, with signs of long-term abuse.

Gizzell Ford's body was cold when firefighters responded to a report Friday morning that the child was not breathing.

The girl lived at her grandmother Helen Ford's apartment in the Austin area of Chicago, along with her bedridden father and two brothers, 12 and 9.

Authorities say Ford was the girl's only caregiver.

An autopsy conducted Saturday revealed that the cause of death was strangulation and multiple blunt trauma injuries. The girl's death has been ruled a homicide.

Responders found the girl laying on her back in a bedroom with her father.

The grandmother denied killing the girl - saying that she had just fixed her a peanut butter and jelly sandwich when the girl complained about being sore.

She told her to take a hot bath and got her some water to drink.

It was then, Ford said, that the girl stopped breathing.

Ford said the injuries on the girl's body were self-inflicted because she was upset her mom wasn't visiting. Ford also said that the mother's boyfriend abused Gizzell.

Investigators recovered a pole, twine and cables from the apartment - some of which had blood on them, according to the prosecutor.

Several other injuries on the girl's body show that this was a case of long term abuse.

One head injury was so old that maggots had hatched in it and spread to the girl's scalp.

Prosecutors listed several other injuries found on the girl's body at Ford's hearing on Sunday. They found a deep laceration on her buttocks, ligature marks on the girl's ankles and wrists and circular marks which may have been cigarette burns.

There were cuts on her face, ears and lips, as well as bruises and puncture wounds on her back, chest and abdomen, with bruising on the front and back of her neck.

Neighbors and friends of the grandmother were surprised to here of the possible long-term abuse of her grandchild.

One neighbor told NBC Chicago that Ford must have just snapped because 'nobody never seen the woman do nothing wrong around here (sic).'

At the court hearing Sunday another man  who said he knew the victim's father and knew Ford since he was in the 5th grade, didn't think she was capable of such abuse.

'It never seemed that way,' he said.

But relatives of the victim's mother had another story.

Gizzell's uncle Osvaldo Mercado told the Chicago Tribune that Ford kept the girl from her family.

'Helen blocked everybody,' Osvaldo said. She would say '"Gizzell can't talk - she's in the shower, or on punishment." It was an excuse every time we called.'

Remembered: Gizzell's uncle described the girl as smart and well mannered who loved being around her cousins

Mercado said he hadn't seen the girl since Easter. None of the girl's mother's family had been allowed to see her in recent months. Gizzell was supposed to go on a camping trip with her aunt the day she died, but her grandmother wouldn't allowed it, Mercado said.

According to Mercado, Gizzell was smart and well-mannered.

'She was outgoing; she spoke to everybody,' he said. 'It was like one big party when she got together with her cousins.'

Now, he wants justice and answers for her death.

Ford is being held without bail on charges of first-degree murder

Gizzell's two brothers, who were in the care of their grandmother as well, have been placed into foster care.

The Department of Children and Family Services is investigating both the grandmother and father for abuse and neglect of the three children.
