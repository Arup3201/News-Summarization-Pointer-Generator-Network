This sickening photograph shows a sheep suffering an agonising death - trapped by the hydraulic roof of a cattle wagon.

Drivers watched in horror as they saw the lorry with the sheep's head crushed between the heavy top meant to prevent animals from falling out.

The farmer was eventually flagged down on the country road but it was too late for the sheep which died from strangulation.

Government agriculture officials are now investigating the alleged animal cruelty in Pembrokeshire, West Wales.

The photograph was taken by a member of an animal charity who was driving behind the cattle lorry.

It caused outrage when it was posted on the Facebook page of the charity which works to protect horses.

A spokesman for the group called VANAH said: 'It is very clear that the codes of conduct which regulate the movement of these animals were ignored.

'The driver loaded the vehicle with live sheep, and one somehow, got trapped in the door when it was closed.

'The sheep would not have survived very long due to the immense pressure of the closing of the ramp.

'It suffered considerable pain, hung there bleeding or suffocating or with a broken neck.'

The sheep was one of hundreds in the cattle wagon being transported from a farm for sale at a market in West Wales.

The interior of the transporter has three different levels to load in as many sheep as possible.

But, according to one livestock haulier, it appears this sheep has its head trapped by the hydraulic roof when it was been brought down to prevent animals from falling from the top foor during transport.

A Pembrokeshire County Council spokesman said: 'Our Animal Health Team is currently investigating in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

'We believe the photograph to be genuine. We are also looking at the design of this particular wagon.'
