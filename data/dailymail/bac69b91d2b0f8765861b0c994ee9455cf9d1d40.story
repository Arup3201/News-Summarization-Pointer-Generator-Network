Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks was questioned by police today about payments to Ministry of Defence officials.

Mrs Brooks, a former editor of The Sun, is understood to have been asked about evidence handed over by News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee.

The 41-year-old was first arrested by detectives in July on suspicion of phone hacking and corruption, days after she quit News International.

Hacking probe: Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie were among six people held in the phone-hacking arrests last week

She answered bail today after being rearrested last week with her racehorse trainer husband Charlie on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

Police searched several addresses in Oxfordshire, London, Hampshire and Hertfordshire after the couple were held along with four other suspects.

Her lawyer, Stephen Parkinson, recently said evidence given by Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers at the Leveson Inquiry had brought 'much prejudicial material' into the public domain.

Mrs Brooks' relations with top police officers and politicians have been called into question in recent weeks after it emerged that she 'fostered' a police horse when it retired from active service in 2008.

She paid food and vet bills until the animal, called Raisa, was rehoused with a police officer in 2010, months before fresh investigations began into illegal activities at the News of the World.

The number of people arrested in Operation Weeting, which has been running since last January when police reopened investigations, stands at 22

A total of 22 people have been arrested under Weeting, which has been running since January last year, Scotland Yard said.

Born on May 27 1968, Ms Brooks grew up in Warrington, Cheshire, before heading off to Paris for a stint studying at the Sorbonne.

Returning to her home county, she landed a job as a secretary at Eddie Shah's Messenger Group and soon persuaded those in charge to let her loose reporting.

She then got a job working on the News of the World's Sunday magazine.

Her passion for News International was ignited and she remained at the Rupert Murdoch stable.

Sent to The Sun in 1998, two years later she landed the top job at the News of the World aged just 31.

In 2003 she became the first woman to edit The Sun and in 2009 was appointed chief executive of News International.
