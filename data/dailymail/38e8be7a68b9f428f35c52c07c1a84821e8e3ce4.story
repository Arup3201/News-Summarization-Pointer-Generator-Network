Nasa’s first spacewalk since April is currently underway, and can be watched live online.

American astronaut Reid Wiseman and German Alexander Gerst are working together to move a broken pump, that has been been outside the station since December, into its proper storage location. 

The spacewalk is scheduled to last until about 7.40pm BST (2.40pm EST) today.

US-based spacewalks were curtailed in July 2013 after Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet.

Nasa solved the problem with the suit's water-cooling system, but then concern arose over the spacesuit batteries.

New batteries arrived late last month, clearing the way for today's spacewalk, and another one scheduled for next week.

The 780lb (350kg) pump on the move is about the size of a double-door refrigerator.

Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998.

It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three.

The station orbits at a height of about 264 miles (425 kilometres).

It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000 kilograms) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house.

It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600 kilometres) per hour.

It has now been in space for more than 5,800 days, during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for over 13 years. 

It ended up in temporary storage during urgent spacewalking repairs to the station's ammonia-cooling system last December.

Nasa did not want to waste time back then putting the pump in the correct long-term location, given all the spacesuit worries.

This was the first spacewalk ever for Mr Wiseman and Mr Gerst, and the former’s exuberance was evident as he emerged from the hatch into the vast darkness over the Pacific.

‘Wow, looks like we've almost got a full moon out here. It's beautiful,’ he said.

When the glow of sunrise started to appear several minutes later, he shared his excitement again with Mission Control.

A follow-up spacewalk is scheduled for 15 October to further whittle down Nasa’s lengthy to-do list, on hold since the 2013 incident.

That spacewalk will be conducted by Mr Wiseman and fellow American Butch Wilmore, a newcomer.

A week after that, two of the three Russians on board will perform a spacewalk on their country's side of the orbiting outpost. 

The Moscow-led spacewalks were unaffected by Nasa's spacesuit troubles.

The pump could not be moved until now owing to spacesuit troubles. In July last year, Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano almost drowned when his helmet filled with water following a coolant fault. And later a battery malfunction left astronauts unable to go out the station. Pictured is a still image from the current spacewalk

In July 2013, Nasa was forced to dramatically abandon a spacewalk on the ISS after a dangerous water leak in an astronaut's helmet drenched his eyes, nose and mouth.

Italy's first spacewalker, Luca Parmitano, endured the terrifying experience when his drink bag tipped half a liter of floating liquid around his face.

Parmitano could not speak or hear his radio due to the water, and he got wedged outside the craft before being helped in by fellow astronauts.

The leak was so bad that Parmitano asked his spacewalking partner, American Christopher Cassidy, to help him back in. 'It's a lot of water,' the Italian said once he was back in the air lock of the station.

He later recalled that he thought he was going to drown during the ordeal. 

The helmets used by Mr Wiseman and Mr Gerst for today's spacewalk contained absorbent pads and makeshift snorkels in case of water leakage. 

As for the spacesuit batteries, Nasa sent up replacements on the latest SpaceX cargo ship and Russian Soyuz capsule.

Ground testing uncovered a potential fuse problem earlier this year, and Nasa opted to switch out the batteries on board.

In the movie Gravity, which stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the astronauts fight for survival after a cloud of debris wrecks their Space Shuttle and subsequently destroys the ISS (shown). The latest spacewalk might not be this dramatic but the feat of engineering involved is impressive nonetheless
