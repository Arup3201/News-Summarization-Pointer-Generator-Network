Asiana announced on Wednesday it dropped plans for legal action against a San Francisco TV station over the use of racially offensive names - but 83 passengers of the ill fated flight have said they will sue aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the airline.

The South Korean air carrier said that KTVU-TV has already apologized for using fake names for four pilots on a plane that crashed in San Francisco on July 6th and that their efforts were better spent on helping the recovery of the survivors and their families.

And in a sign of the post-traumatic stress caused by the crash which killed three, Asiana revealed that the four pilots of the Boeing 777 have been hospitalized in South Korea 'for psychological trauma and injuries caused by the incident.'

No Lawsuit: KTVU News read these names live on television today stating that the National Transportation Safety Board had confirmed that these were the pilots of Asiana 214

Broken news: Anchor Tori Campbell read the names off the teleprompter and didn't bat an eye, adding that the information had been confirmed by the National Transportation Safety Board

The Associated Press spoke to officials in South Korea's Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry on the condition of anonymity and follows medical checkups the pilots received on returning home over the weekend.

Last week, an anchor for KTVU-TV read the fake names – apparently someone's idea of a prank to use fake Asian-style names that sounded out distress calls and curse words – on air and then apologized after a break.

Asiana earlier said the report seriously damaged its reputation. It said Monday that it would sue the TV station to respond to the racially discriminatory report that disparaged Asians.

The airline had said this week that it would sue the television station because the reporting defamed the pilots and the company.

The crash of the Boeing 777 plane resulted in the death of three Chinese teenage girls who were visiting the United States for a summer camp. More than 180 passengers and crew members were injured.

'Asiana Airlines has decided not to proceed with the case since KTVU has issued a formal apology and in order for us to focus all our efforts on managing the aftermath of the accident,' the South Korean company said in a statement, according to Reuters.

KTVU-TV was quick to correct the gaffe after an ad break following the humiliating broadcast, clarifying the names were clearly wrong and blaming the NTSB for the incorrect information.

The NTSB also apologized, releasing a statement admitting a summer intern had 'erroneously' confirmed the names.

'The National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6,' the NTSB said last week.

On Wednesday, a Chicago law firm announced that  it has taken steps to sue aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. on behalf of 83 people who were aboard the Asiana Airlines flight that crash-landed in San Francisco earlier this month, claiming in a court filing that the crash might have been caused by a mechanical malfunction of the Boeing 777's auto throttle.

Ribbeck Law Chartered on Monday filed a petition for discovery - a move meant to preserve evidence - in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, where Boeing is headquartered.

The law firm said in a news release that additional pleadings will be filed against Asiana Airlines and several component parts manufacturers in coming days.

Ribbeck said that in addition to potential problems with the auto throttle, some emergency slides reportedly opened inside the plane, injuring passengers and blocking their exit, and some passengers had to be cut out of their seat-belts with a knife.

Three people were killed when the airplane, carrying 307 passengers and crew on a flight from South Korea to San Francisco International Airport on July 6th, approached the runway too low and slow.

It clipped a seawall at the end of a runway, tearing off the tail and sending the plane spinning down the runway. The impact caused the plane to catch fire.

'We must find the causes of the crash and demand that the problems with the airline and the aircraft are immediately resolved to avoid future tragedies,' attorney Monica R. Kelly, head of Ribbeck's aviation department, said in a written statement.

Boeing spokesman John Dern said the company had no comment.

The petition asks a judge to order Boeing to identify the designer and manufacturer of the airplane's autothrottle and its emergency evacuation slides.

It also seeks information on the systems that indicate the airplane's glide slope and that warn how close it is to the ground.

Kelly said the firm wants to protect the wreckage 'from destructive testing' and to obtain maintenance records, internal memos and other evidence.

The pilots of Asiana Flight 214 have told investigators they were relying on automated cockpit equipment to control their speed. Inspectors found that the autothrottle had been 'armed,' or made ready for activation, but investigators are still determining whether it had been engaged, the National Transportation Safety Board has said.
