A video has been released capturing the shocking moment a gym teacher dragged a 14-year-old girl to a pool after she refused to swim because she didn't want to ruin her hair.

Denny Peterson, who worked at Edison High School in Stockton, California, is now facing a charge of corporal injury to a child.

The incident took place in August after the girl refused to get in the pool because her hair was done that morning and she had an event to attend that night.

A video has been released capturing the shocking moment a gym teacher tried to drag a 14-year-old girl into a  swimming pool after she refused to get in because she didn't want to ruin her hair

Denny Peterson, who worked at Edison High School in Stockton, California, is now facing a charge of corporal injury to a child

In the clip, filmed by another student, Peterson is seen dragging the girl across the tiled floor towards the pool as she resists

The teenager, who asked not to be named, but whose mother permitted Inside Edition to interview her, said: 'It makes me want to cry seeing the video. I was really upset'. Pictured: The student (center) with her mother Susie Garcia (right)  and her lawyer Gilbert Somera (left)

In the clip, filmed by another student, Peterson is seen dragging the girl across the tiled floor towards the pool as she resists, reports 6ABC.

The girl, who is on the floor wearing short and a bikini bra, is clearly trying to get away and angles  her body away from the pool.

The video goes on for 95 seconds and one point a student throws water on the pair.

The teenager, who asked not to be named, but whose mother permitted Inside Edition to interview her said: 'It makes me want to cry seeing the video. I was really upset. 

'I was embarrassed and angry that he was doing all of this in front of people, just putting his hands on me.'

Her mother Susie Garcia said: 'You don't expect a teacher to do this to your child when she goes to school.'

Gilbert Somera, a Stockton attorney representing the girl and her family said: 'Regardless of her participation (in the class) it should disgust you how this man put his hands on a 14-year-old girl. 

'She said multiple times, "my top is falling down,'' Somera said.  

Somera added to Inside Edition: 'No means no, and stop certainly means stop. This was carried on for more than a minute and a half, two minutes. He dragged her down from the stairs. She's got big bruises on her leg. At some point as an adult you have to say, "What am I doing?"' 

He is preparing a claim and likely a lawsuit over the struggle.

Peterson, who has been employed by the school district for more than 10 years, was put on paid leave for a month immediately following the incident.

But he was then reassigned to another Stockton campus. 

He was placed on leave again after News10 notified the school district Peterson was facing a misdemeanor charge of corporal injury to a child.
