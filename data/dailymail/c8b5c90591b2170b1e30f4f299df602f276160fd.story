Police in Singapore destroyed two pieces of evidence tied to the death of Shane Todd, whose body was found in his apartment there in June 2012, according to the American engineer's family.

The 31-year-old's parents, Rick and Mary Todd, have for months been demanding the Singapore government return the hand-made noose and towel around their son's neck when his body was discovered by his girlfriend hanging from his bathroom door.

The authorities there deemed the incident a suicide yet the towel and the noose - made from a computer bag strap - contained the DNA of two unknown people, according to official reports.

Rick and Mary Todd, who believe their son was murdered, have been battling to get the noose and towel back from Singaporean authorities for months

No further testing was done to determine whose DNA it was.

'Rick and I wanted the towel and the strap returned to us in order to do what the SPF [Singapore Police Force] should have done in the first place - to test the...DNA (on the items),' Mary Todd told CBS News. 'We have ample evidence that our son was murdered, but the towel and the strap were the only DNA evidence in Shane's case, and now they have been destroyed forever.'

She added that the items should be returned because they belong to her son. She and her husband retained a Singapore lawyer to help them get to the bottom of the incident, and the issue of what happened to the noose and towel became the subject of emails, official letters and hearings in recent months.

Singapore's attorney general, however, said in a report that it is 'normal protocol' for items used in hanging cases to be 'forfeited to the state for disposal'.

The government had asked the family to explain why it wanted the items returned but the lawyer refused the request, CBS News reported.

'In law, there is no reason to explain why you want your property back,' the lawyer wrote to the Todd family. 'It's like justifying to a robber why you want your belongings returned. Sheer chutzpah. It's the family's by right.

Singapore's state coroner concluded in July of last year that Todd's death was caused by 'asphyxia due to hanging' and ruled out foul play.

The Todds, however, insist their son was murdered after he was asked to compromise U.S. security by revealing secrets to a Chinese company, and that the crime scene was staged to make it appear like suicide.

The company, Huawei Technologies, which has been declared a threat to U.S. national security by the House Intelligence Committee, was at the time discussing a joint project with Todd's Singapore employer, the Institute of Microelectronics.

Both companies deny their business discussions involved any classified military information. The project was abandoned soon after Todd's death.
