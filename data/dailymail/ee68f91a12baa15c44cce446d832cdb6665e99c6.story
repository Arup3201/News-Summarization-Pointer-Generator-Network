Ashley Talbot, 15, was run over and killed by a school minibus at Maesteg Comprehensive School in South Wales

A teacher killed a 15-year-old pupil by accidentally running him over in the school minibus on the way to a rugby match.

PE teacher Chris Brooks, 33, was driving the vehicle when he hit Ashley Talbot in the school grounds.

The teenager died at the scene from his injuries.

Mr Brooks, who yesterday was being comforted at home, was said to be ‘devastated’ by the accident, which also left a 13-year-old pupil with minor injuries.

He said: ‘All my thoughts, wishes and prayers are with Ashley’s family.’

The popular teacher was about to drive the Year 11 rugby team from Maesteg Comprehensive School, near Bridgend, South Wales, three miles to a match on Wednesday afternoon.

Police were yesterday interviewing pupils who witnessed the incident to try to establish the precise sequence of events, but the school described it as a ‘tragic accident’.

Students are being encouraged to write messages about how they are feeling to put on a Christmas tree in the school atrium.

The school has also cancelled a Christmas carol service due to take place tonight. 

Ashley’s classmates wrote a touching tribute to their friend which was read out at the school and said: ‘The gap that Ashley leaves can never be filled.

‘Every morning Ashley would make us smile, his bubbly personality was infectious.

‘He was such good company and a good friend to everyone who knew him. He was passionate about his motorbike and fixing cars.

‘Ashley would always look for the good in everyone. He will always be in our hearts and will never be forgotten.’

Chairman of governors Keith Edwards described Ashley, a keen motorcross rider, as ‘an all-round good kid’ who would be greatly missed by staff and pupils.

As well as the Christmas tree messages, fellow students paid tribute on social media.

The minibus that killed Ashley was being driven by school PE teacher Chris Brooks, 33

Darcy Hawkins said on Twitter: ‘Can’t help think how close it is to Christmas for something so awful to happen, really not fair.’

Katie Thomas said: ‘Can’t imagine how Mr Brooks is feeling, hands down the nicest man and best teacher I ever had.’

Mr Brooks is a keen sportsman who carried the Olympic torch during the national relay ahead of London 2012.

Mr Edwards said of Mr Brooks: ‘He is devastated. He is the sort of person who goes the extra mile to help the pupils.

‘That’s what he was doing at the time – taking pupils away from the school for a game of rugby.

Police remain at Maesteg Comprehensive School in South Wales, but said they are treating the death as a  'tragic accident.'

‘He is home at the moment and we will give him all the time and support he needs. 

He has spoken to the headteacher about what happened and we are all cooperating with the police investigation.’

Deborah McMillan, head of education at Bridgend County Council, said pupils would be offered counselling to cope with the tragedy. 

She added: ‘We are going to try and make the day as normal as possible but provide some space for pupils that need some time out.’

A short statement released by the school said: ‘Our thoughts are with the family, friends and everyone who has been affected by this tragic accident.’

South Wales Police has launched an investigation into how Ashley was killed on the school grounds. A forensic test of the minibus will be carried out. The Health and Safety Executive has also been notified.

A police van remained parked outside the school last night while officers continued their inquiries
