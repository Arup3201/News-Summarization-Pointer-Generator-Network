Bacary Sagna has revealed ex-Arsenal duo Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy were influential in him making the similar switch to Manchester City this summer.

The right-back followed his French compatriots to the Premier League champions on a free after declining several contract offers in North London.

And after seeing the success Nasri and Clichy have enjoyed, Sagna says it was an easy decision to make once he was sure he wanted to leave the Gunners.

Friendship: The trio have played with eachother for France, Arsenal, and now the Premier League champions

'Yes, I spoke to them [Nasri and Clichy] many times, Sagna told mcfc.co.uk in his first interview with the club. 

'They knew I was free and wanted to move, and told me to come because they have a great team with a great mentality, who work hard and win trophies.

Sagna is believed to have been offered a £150,000-a-week package to join City, where he will battle with Pablo Zabaleta to be first choice.

A more comfortable season as regular right-back could have been in store for the 31-year-old with Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, but he claims he needed to 'start from the bottom' to challenge himself again.

'I needed a change, I spent seven years at Arsenal and I had great times there but I wanted to start from the bottom again and work hard again 

'When you come into a team like this it's not hard to motivate yourself, I watched them celebrate last season and three years ago and I wanted to celebrate too.'

City's pre-season has largely been peen played in the U.S this summer, where they featured in the International Champions Cup.

Sagna has only just returned to training after his World Cup exploits, and may miss out on the club's last 'friendly', the Community Shield against former club Arsenal at Wembley on Sunday.

No sentimentality: Sagna says Arsenal are just another club for City to beat in the Premier League

He won't have to wait long to meet his former team-mates again though, with the two clubs due to meet at the Emirates Stadium in the fourth game of the season.

Not one from sentimentality, Sagna says he won't treat the game any differently. 

Asked if the date was penciled in his diary, he replied: 'Not at all. Arsenal are one of the other teams who we have to play and beat. My team is Manchester City and I will give the maximum.'
