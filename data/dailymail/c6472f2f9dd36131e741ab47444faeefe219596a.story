A family of travellers who kept homeless drug addicts and alcoholics as virtual slaves were last night facing years behind bars.

The Connors family owned homes with hot tubs; a fleet of cars including a Rolls-Royce and  a Mercedes saloon; enjoyed Caribbean cruises and holidays in Mexico and Dubai; and had £500,000 in the bank.

But their fortune came from constructing driveways and patios using a workforce of vulnerable men kept in squalid conditions, paid a pittance, and living in fear of violence.

Cruelty: Wealthy traveller William Connors, 51, berates one of his labourers at a caravan park

Terrified: The labourers faced the constant threat of being attacked by their 'employers', sometimes with implements including rakes and broom handles

Sick: Connors is caught on CCTV apparently assaulting one of the slaves he was said to pay less than £5 a day

Savage: The work was monotonous, arduous and often humiliating, and they were controlled by discipline and violence

The workers were given alcohol and cannabis but so little food they resorted to scavenging from dustbins for leftovers.

Some were effectively forced to work 
for the family for 30 years, and many were beaten, hit with broom 
handles, belts, a rake and a shovel, and punched and kicked for 
displeasing their masters.

One worker had a hosepipe shoved down his throat and the men were often made to strip for a ‘hosing down’ with freezing water.

They told police they were unable to escape because they had too little money to afford train tickets.

Called ‘the dossers’ by their masters, those who did try to slip away were usually soon rounded up.

Yesterday, a jury unanimously 
convicted William ‘Big boss’ Connors, 52, his wife Mary, 48, their sons 
John, 29, and James, 20, and their son-in-law Miles Connors, 24, of 
conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour.

There was such screaming and uproar 
from relatives in the public gallery at Bristol Crown Court that the 
judge ordered security guards to clear the room.

Police began investigating the 
defendants – most of whom gave home addresses in Staverton, 
Gloucestershire, with Miles being listed as from Bradford – following 
the discovery of the decomposed body of worker Christopher Nicholls, 40,
 in a shed close to a Gloucestershire caravan site in 2008.

He had been involved in a serious road
 accident four years earlier. And in 2009 one unnamed worker told 
detectives he’d had his identity documents taken and was rarely paid and
 received little food.

The specific offence of which the 
family were found guilty came into law only in April 2010, which is why 
the charges against them dated between that month and March 2011, when 
police raided sites in Staverton, Enderby and Mansfield in 
Nottinghamshire, rescuing 19 workers.

The family maintained the men were 
‘free agents’, with William and Mary claiming they were ‘good 
Samaritans’ providing the homeless with food, work and shelter.

In practice the men were often given 
just £5 a day for heavy labour and emptying toilet buckets. And violence
 was an ever-present threat.

Prosecutor Christopher Quinlan QC said
 the violence was ‘a clear and unequivocal demonstration of control and 
dominance, of one set, the family, over another’.

While their team of workers lived 
crammed together in just a few squalid caravans, the family had several 
other spotless caravans, which appeared unlived in – with toilets even 
used for storing wads of cash.

The family’s property portfolio is potentially now worth millions of pounds, with holdings including two caravan parks.

Police now plan to seize the family’s 
assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation. They will also seek 
to prevent them from tarmacking and paving drives in the future with a 
Serious Crime Prevention Order.

Detective Chief Inspector Dave 
Sellwood, who led the investigation, said senior detectives were too 
appalled by the workers’ conditions to set foot inside their caravans, 
adding: ‘I have never seen one group of human beings treat another group
 so badly for so long just for their financial benefit.’

The five family members have been remanded in custody to be sentenced on Tuesday.

William and Mary Connors (pictured below on a cruise) lived the high life while their workers were treated 
appallingly, said the detective who led the investigation into the family.

Detective Chief Inspector Dave Sellwood, of Gloucestershire Police, said: 'The
 Connors caravans were beautiful, they were absolutely pristine, they 
were new, without exception, and in absolutely immaculate condition.

'In most cases the cookers had never been used, the toilets had never been used. They lived a very good life.'

Police
 plan to launch an investigation into the Connors' wealth and to use 
Proceeds of Crime Act legislation to seize their assets.

'They are very wealthy,' said Mr Sellwood. '[Billy] has been to Dubai, Cancun and to the USA. This criminal operation is not about getting by and scraping a living.

'I have never seen one group of human beings treat another group so badly for so long just for their financial benefit.'

Mr Sellwood said even hardened detectives were shocked by the raids in March last year.

'Having observed accounts from people that got away from them, we understood that they would be living in poor conditions.

'But
 actually some of the conditions were far worse. I brought some of my 
officers along to see first-hand the conditions that these workers were 
living in because I knew I was going to find it was impossible to 
describe.

'This was a 
group of very experienced senior detectives and none of them were 
prepared to set foot inside either of the two caravans and certainly 
when I did set foot in them I wasn't prepared to touch any of the 
surfaces.'

Mr Sellwood added: 'The
 evidence that we have heard in court is just a proportion of the 
information that is available to the police in terms of the treatment 
that the Connors handed out.

'The
 two assaults that we did catch on video, one was on a 17-year-old man 
with learning difficulties, the other an older gentleman that had been 
with them for about 11 years.

'He is currently incapable of living alone and is in supported accommodation and will be for the rest of his life. I think that is an example of the Connors' treatment of very vulnerable men.'

The vulnerable men working for the Connors family were forced to live in squalor, carry out menial tasks and work in hard and often freezing conditions.

They were usually homeless, alcoholics or drug addicts and they were used as cheap labour for the Connors’ paving and patio businesses.

Oliver was picked up by Miles Connors, William, pictured below centre with labourers at a construction site, and Mary Connors son-in-law, in March 2010 and lived on traveller sites in the Midlands and in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

A recovering alcoholic, he did not want to reveal his full identity, but told ITV West: 'They were keeping us rock bottom and giving us just enough to survive on, supplying us with alcohol, supplying us with cannabis.

'Not eating enough, the coldness, the emptying of the slop buckets for them... they never did anything for themselves - it was horrible.

'It was a low point for me, but when I first met the man he promised me that he could help.'

Oliver’s work was monotonous and unrelenting and he was often controlled by violence.

'I did actually witness one of them hitting somebody with a shovel,' he said. 'Maybe he said something wrong to him, maybe he was complaining - that was the treatment you got if you complained.'

When asked why he and the other workers did not leave, he maintained 'it was a lot harder to do than that'. Some men who left were rounded up and brought back.

'I did actually escape myself once, but it is hard to do,' said Oliver, who is in his 40s. 'You don’t have any money, you can’t go to the train station and get a train ticket - you have no money to do anything like that - so the only thing you know is best go back.'

Oliver was rescued with four other workers when police raided a traveller site at Kirk Lane, Enderby, Leicestershire, on March 22 last year and arrested Miles Connors.

'Slowly but surely it is leaving my head, it is always going to be there, but I’m starting to live back in a normal life again,' he said.
