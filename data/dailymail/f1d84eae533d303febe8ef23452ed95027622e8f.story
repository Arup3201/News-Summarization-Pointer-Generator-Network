To counter a planned Westboro Baptist protest at the funeral of a local soldier, 2,000 town residents lined the streets.

Oregon locals congregated en masse at Army Ranger Cody James Patterson’s memorial service after the Kansas-based church, notorious for offensively picketing the funerals of servicemen killed in action, decided to target his service.

Oregon State University students Matt Enloe and Lexie Lynn Merrill organized a Facebook event, encouraging residents to peacefully counter the church’s protest.

People power: Thousands of residents turn out to counter a protest by the Westboro Baptist Church at the funeral of a fallen soldier, killed in Afghanistan

The hugely successful counter protest meant the Westboro Baptists did not show up at the service at the Lasells Stewart Center on university campus on October 20.

Pfc Patterson was killed in action during a suicide bombing earlier this month in Afghanistan.

A YouTube video of the protest showed the incredible support of locals.

The church claimed that Pfc Patterson, along with other soldiers were killed by God's wrath as punishment for the existence of homosexuality in America.

They said: 'To deny us our First Amendment rights is to declare to the world that Pfc. Patterson died in vain and that America is nation of sodomite hypocrites.'

The voiceover said: ‘The Westboro Baptist Church did something good today. 

‘They inspired thousands of people of 
all ages, religions and beliefs to band together.

'Veterans, mothers, 
fathers, the LGBT community, soldiers, military leaders, the Gypsy 
Jokers, Republicans, Democrats, Liberals, Beavers and Ducks, students, 
teachers, friends, and even those who just came to show their support to
 a grieving family.

‘Thousands stood together today and in their silence, you could still hear one word loud and clear: love.’

Joseph Hedberg, a National Guard veteran, told Katu.com: ‘We want to be completely peaceful, and we want to just represent the country that he fought and died for by having the American flag out here to keep the signs covered.’

The church is widely known for its extreme positions against gay marriage and offensive demonstrations interrupting the funerals of dead servicemen.

In protests they brandish placards with phrases such as 'Thank God for IEDs, 'Fag soldier in hell' and 'Soldiers die 4 fag marriage'.

The small sect, which is believed to have just a few dozen members, was founded in Topeka, Kansas in 1955 by Fred Phelps.

The organization teaches that homosexuality is the root of all evil and that anyone who refuses to denounce it is the cause of all tragedies, including war deaths.

Inspired many: A YouTube video of the peaceful protest captured the huge support from the community
