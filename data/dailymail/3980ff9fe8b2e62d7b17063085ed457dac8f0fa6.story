Scientists are gearing up for fierce solar storms next year by setting up a worldwide chain of monitoring stations to study the so-called 'solar maximum'.

Massive increases in the numbers of sunspots are expected to cause changes in the Earth's ionosphere, the shell of plasma at the top of our atmosphere.

There are fears because the current generation of satellite navigation technology has never experience a 'solar max', and changes in the ionosphere could cause problems with GPS and other signals from space.

Sun spots are seen as the moon moves into a full eclipse position seen in the U.S. in May: Late summer will see the Sun reach the maximum point of its 11-year cycle, resulting in an increase in such activity

Discovered by 20th-century radio pioneers who bounced long-wave radio signals off it, the ionosphere is a layer of electrically charged particles strongly influenced by the Sun.

With the coming of the Space Age, radio signals started passing through the ionosphere to and from orbiting satellites and today everyday life is more reliant than ever on these space systems.

During solar maximum, large numbers of sunspots appear and the sun's irradiance output grows by about 0.1 per cent, with the increased energy output thought to affect global climate and weather patterns.

The ionosphere becomes most turbulent as the Sun’s warming thickens it, and then again in the evening as cooling leads to turbulence – including the production of 'plasma bubbles'.

The effect on radio systems includes signal delay – a major problem factor for satnav, where ranging is based on timing accurate to a billionth of a second – and signal-scattering ‘scintillations’ rendering the signal unstable.

To monitor the effects of the solar max on Earth's upper atmosphere and the consequences for satellite navigation and communications, the European Space Agency is setting up a worldwide chain of monitoring stations.

'The current Monitor network is still being developed but has already been detecting mild ionospheric storms,' said Roberto Prieto-Cerdeira, the scientist in charge of the project.

The solar maximum is the period of greatest solar activity in the Sun's 11-year cycle.

The Sun's magnetic field lines are the most distorted at this time due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles.

This causes large numbers of sunspots appear, and the Sun's irradiance output grows by about 0.1 per cent.

The increased energy output of solar maxima can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns.

The solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next, with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle.

Large solar flares often occur during a maximum. For example, the Solar storm of 1859 struck the Earth with such intensity the northern lights could be seen as far south as Rome.

The last solar maximum was in 2000. In 2006 NASA initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011, and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958.

However, more recent projections say the maximum should arrive in autumn of 2013 and be the smallest sunspot cycle since 1906.

Monitor stations work by measuring variations in GPS signals with greater accuracy than existing systems.

'We are placing sensor stations around the globe, but the vicinity of the equator is a particular focus of interest,' added Dr Prieto-Cerdeira.

'It exhibits much more dynamic behaviour than the mid-latitudes so we have established stations at Cape Verde off West Africa and Malindi, Kenya, on the other side of the continent.

'In addition, through a deal with French space agency CNES, we will have access to stations hosted by existing tracking sites at Libreville, Gabon and Ascension Island in the mid-Atlantic, the latter site being where the magnetic equator diverts from the geographic equator.

'Further sensor stations under consideration are Maspalomas in the Canary Islands and Kourou in French Guiana.

'Stations in Kevo and Sodankylä in the Arctic, provide high-latitude coverage.'

At solar maximum, the Sun's magnetic field lines are the most distorted due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles.

The solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next, with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle.

Large solar flares often occur during a maximum. For example, the Solar storm of 1859 struck the Earth with such intensity that the northern lights could be seen as far south as Rome, approximately 42° north of the equator.

Increases in the number of sunspots will cause changes in the ionosphere that could interfere with radio transmissions from space

GPS relies on transmissions timed to the split-second, and there are fears the interference could case serious problems with navigation
