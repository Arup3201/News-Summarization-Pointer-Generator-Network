Up to 24million workers are to get a break down of exactly where their taxes are spent.

The personalised statements will show that more than one pound in every five goes on welfare, more than any other area of spending.

Chancellor George Osborne hopes by showing millions of people where their money goes, voters will be more willing to accept more years of austerity.

New personal tax statements will spell out where tax and National Insurance is spent. This one is for someone earning £30,000

Up to 24million personal tax statements will be sent out, like this one for someone earning £30,0000

The breakdown shows that around 23 per cent of all taxes go on welfare, 19 per cent on health and 15 per cent on pensions. Education accounts for 13 per cent.

The next largest amount - 7 per cent - is money just used to pay the interest on the nation's debts.

Defence and criminal justice make up 5 per cent each of all spending, with transport 3 per cent.

Government administration, culture, environment, housing and business spending account for only 2 per cent each.

The UK contribution to the European Union budget is equivalent to just 0.87 per cent of spending.

The controversial policy to increase spending on foreign aid mean 0.55 per cent of personal tax goes on overseas aid.

Someone earning £20,000 will pay £4,542 in tax and National Insurance, according to the examples shown

Mr Osborne said in 2012: 'This will 
tell people how much income tax and national insurance they have paid; 
their average tax rates; and how this contributes to public spending.

'In
 other words - how much, proportionately, of their tax bill goes to fund
 the healthcare, education, or welfare; and how much is spent on 
servicing interest payments on the national debt.

A smartphone app has been created for anyone to see how much tax they pay and where it goes

'People will know what they are paying – and what they are paying it for.

'A tax system that is simple and transparent: that is our first goal.Announcing the move in 2012.'

The
 Treasury has published examples of what the new statement will look 
like. Someone earning £23,000 in 2013-14 would pay £4,541.76 in tax and 
National Insurance.

This means £1,024 goes on welfare, £842 on health and £682 on state pensions. Just £40 goes to the European Union.

For someone earning £30,000, they would pay tax and National Insurance totalling £6,781.40, including £1,529 on benefits, £1,257 on the NHS and £1,019 on pensions.

The plan to release the statements was first announced in 2012, when Mr Osborne said 20million would receive them.

But yesterday he announced an extra 4million letters would be sent out from October this year.

Those receiving them include 8million people who complete self-assessment returns online and the 16 million PAYE taxpayers who received a tax coding notice from HMRC for 2013/14.

Overall there are 29.9million income taxpayers in the UK and those people who do not receive a tax statement will be able to use the HMRC’s tax calculator to estimate their tax bill and see how it contributes to public spending. 

An app can be downloaded to use on smart phones by searching ‘HMRC tax calculator’.
