A Florida physician's assistant was jailed Thursday after refusing to move his car to allow a medical helicopter access to the scene of a deadly car crash, police say.

James Allen, 52, first drove around emergency vehicles in the Barberville accident that left 26-year-old Tessa George dead.

He then drove directly into the spot cleared for a helicopter and wouldn't move it even as police pleaded and the helicopter hovered 50-100 feet above, authorities say.

Rescuers were responding to a crash that occurred early on Thursday. George, a bartender in Ormond Beach, overcorrected after failing to turn at a curve in the road.

That's when her SUV smashed into a tree beside the road, reports the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

Officials blocked traffic as they called in a helicopter, not knowing if the car's occupants were alive or dead.

As cars backed up, Allen chose to drive around the emergency vehicles, according to the police report, and refused to stop despite police orders.

Police say he then pulled into the spot reserved for the helicopter and refused to move, officials said.

Only when Allen was forced to move his car could the helicopter finally land, and even then police say Allen continued to refuse to produce his driver's license.

In the end, he claimed it was because he was confused about what all the fuss was over.

According to the police report, as he was arrested Allen yelled:

'I always go around firetrucks.'

In answer to his confusion, police charged Allen with failure to obey police-fire department orders and resisting an officer without violence.

He was released on his own recognizance Friday after spending the night in a county jail.
