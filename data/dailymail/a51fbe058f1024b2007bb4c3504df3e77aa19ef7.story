Gynaecologist Dr Anthony Madu, 45, worked shifts as a locum at one hospital while on paid sick leave from another

A doctor who worked shifts as a locum at one hospital while on paid sick leave from another cost the NHS £250,000.

Gynaecologist Dr Anthony Madu, 45, could be struck off after he pocketed huge sums in well-paid locum work at the same time as he was receiving sick pay.

The Nigerian - who pocketed a total of £100,000 as a result of the scam - had insisted he was the victim of a racist conspiracy when NHS bosses suspended him over his conduct.

But he was branded ‘dishonest and irresponsible’ in court as he was found guilty of fraud.

He is understood to have cost the NHS a total of £240,000 in salary and cover for his absence as he worked at hospitals across England while still officially employed by the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board.

Prosecutor Christian Jowett told the court: ‘He was legally obliged to tell his employers about his work but he did not do so.

‘He was also legally obliged to tell two locum agencies that he was on extended leave and had been granted sickness leave.

‘But he continued to work and receive payment from both Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and his work in England.

‘This was a very costly business for the NHS and very lucrative for Dr Madu. ‘That’s why he did it.

‘Madu had been irresponsible as well as dishonest.’

During an investigation by the General Medical Council over his behaviour, Madu he told health chiefs he was the victim of a racist conspiracy.

He made his discrimination claims at a tribunal after he was sacked from Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital for not informing his employers that he was under investigation for fraud.

Madu told the tribunal in Newcastle that his Welsh colleagues had displayed a ‘racist attitude’ and wanted to destroy his career.

He said: ‘I strongly believe if I was not of an ethnic minority this case would have been dealt with very differently.’

Nigerian-born Madu took a specialist registrar obstetrics gynaecology post at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, in August 2009.

But he was suspended and put on extended leave two months later over allegations about his conduct towards other staff and claims he had falsified his training record.

From January 2010, he submitted sick notes signed by his GP on three different occasions, saying he could not work because of stress.

Madu then made £98,904 while working for Sandwell General Hospital in Birmingham as well as Scarborough General Hospital and The Royal Oldham Hospital in Greater Manchester.

The extra cost to the NHS came from paying other staff for cover, his sick pay, and administration costs.

Mr Jowett said: ‘During this extended leave and sickness he continued to work as a locum doctor at hospitals in England.’

Madu, from Woolwich, London was described as being ‘nowhere near’ the level of clinical competence expected of a year five specialist registrar, and convicted of six charges of fraud.

Judge David Wyn Morgan sitting at Newport Crown Court spared him an immediate jail sentence because a psychiatric report said he would be at ‘high risk’ of suicide if he was jailed.

The judge told the doctor: ‘You have persuaded yourself of your innocence of these matters in the face of the evidence.

‘You are a deluded individual led astray by your misunderstanding of your real medical qualifications.

‘In pursuing a medical career in the UK you have overstretched yourself and have resorted to dishonesty to cover up your shortcomings.

‘These convictions will make it impossible for you to practice medicine in the UK ever again.’

Madu was given a 24 month prison sentence suspended for two years.

He was ordered to complete 150 hours community service and will be under curfew and wear an electronic tag for three months.

Madu is currently suspended by the General Medical Council, which has been engaged in a long-running legal battle with him.

They have accused him of misrepresenting his postgraduate training record, behaving inappropriately to colleagues and patients, working in medicine in breach of previously imposed restrictions and failing to co-operate with investigations.

Madu, who suffers with malaria, stress and depression, has contested all the allegations made by the GMC.
