At times last season Manchester United's players might have felt an added weight when the ball came to them at Old Trafford - such was the pressure of being in a poorly performing side used to success.

And new boss Louis van Gaal has continued that trend, but this time by handing his new charges medicine balls during a training session on their US tour.

New signings Luke Shaw and Ander Herrer were part of a big group being put through their paces as David Moyes' successor took a look at the talent he has to play with.

Van Gaal is known to be a harsh taskmaster when it comes to training - but he also showed his soft side during the World Cup, gifting his Holland players generous days off to recharge throughout the tournament.

And his stewardship appears to be being enjoyed by the United players too, with Juan Mata pictured laughing and joking in scenes rarely seen during a drab season at Old Trafford last time round.

The new boss is expected to name a strong side for United's pre season opener against LA Galaxy on Thursday, while giving chances for players from throughout the squad to work towards match fitness.

And if there's anyone that doesn't take his fancy, he need not worry, with United's huge commerical deals constantly coming in vice-chairman Ed Woodward has effectively handed the Dutchman a blank cheque to play with in order to get his squad up to scratch for a title charge.

So it's up to every member of the playing staff to impress, whether that be with a football at their feet or with a medicine ball in their hands.
