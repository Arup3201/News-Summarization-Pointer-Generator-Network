Roger Clemens will not have to pay Brian McNamee a dime after a settlement was reached in the defamation lawsuit that was brought against the former MLB pitcher by his ex-trainer in 2008.

The terms of the settlement call for an undisclosed amount of money to be paid by the former Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees pitcher's insurer AIG.

The deal will not require the seven-time Cy Young Award winner to contribute any money or release any claims against McNamee, attorneys for both men said on Wednesday.

The 2008 lawsuit alleged Clemens pursued a public relations attack against McNamee (pictured above) 

McNamee sued Clemens, 52, for defamation in 2008 after the pitcher said McNamee lied and manufactured evidence when he accused the pitcher of using banned performance-enhancing drugs

That lawsuit alleged Clemens pursued a public relations attack against McNamee after the onetime strength coach told federal agents and Congress he routinely injected the hard-throwing right-hander with steroids and human growth hormone from 1998 through 2001.

Clemens, who pitched until he was 45, has denied the charges and told ESPN McNamee's case was an example of 'somebody out there that is really crawling up your back to make a buck.'

Clemens won seven Cy Young Awards in his career 

The resolution to the long-running dispute was reached after closed-door negotiations before US Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak in Brooklyn.

The case was moved to federal court in 2009. 

Clemens didn't attend the settlement talks. 

His lawyer, Chip Babcock, said AIG negotiated the settlement with McNamee, according to the New York Daily News. 

Babcock said last month: 'If the insurance company wants to pay Mr McNamee, there is not much I can do about that.'

McNamee's attorney Richard Emery said the agreement was fair and allowed everyone involved to move on.

He said: 'At this point it's water over the dam.

'It's high time. This is old news these days.'

Clemens, who also plitched for the Toronto Blue Jays and the Houston Astros in his two-decade-long career, was found not guilty in 2012 of charges of obstructing Congress, making false statements in a deposition and committing perjury when he denied using steroids or human growth hormone injected by McNamee.

After the deal was reached, McNamee told reporters it hadn't sunk in yet.

He said: 'I got to digest this.

'I got to go home and have a good meal. Let me sit with it.'

Clemens has a homeowner's insurance policy with AIG.

A spokesman the insurer declined to comment.
