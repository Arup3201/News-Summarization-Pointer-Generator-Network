A prison guard from East Mississippi has been arrested for allegedly having sex with an inmate.

An East Mississippi Correctional Facility employee, Wedgeworth has since been released on $10,000 bond. Her case will be presented to the next available Lauderdale County Grand Jury.

Wedgeworth was allegedly having sex with an inmate.

It's unknown exactly how this alleged activity was uncovered.

The sheriff's chief deputy, Ward Calhoun, said Wedgeworth was arrested after the alleged act with the prisoner was discovered. He didn't provide any details on the investigation.

'Can't comment to the investigation itself,' Calhoun said. 'However, it is a violation of state statute for an employee, a correctional officer, any employee involved, or who has supervision over an inmate of any kind, any type of detainee, to have any type of sexual relations with that inmate.'

The alleged sexual act took place at an East Mississippi correctional facility

Calhoun says while this type of activity is not exactly uncommon in prisons, it also doesn't happen every day.

'We see it across the state and across the United States," Calhoun points out.

'Where you have individuals who are in charge of someone who they are in custody or in charge of. We see it with school teachers, we have seen it lately with that. We've seen it with correctional officers, law enforcement officers.'

Calhoun said Wedgeworth worked in the facility's educational services area. He did not know how long she worked there or her current employment status.

'And now we'll put it within the hands of the judicial system to carry forth in the prosecution,' Calhoun said.
