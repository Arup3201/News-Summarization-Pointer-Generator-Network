Shocking exams results from a New Jersey school district have revealed that only 19 out of 600 students could get into college.

Just over 3 per cent of pupils from Paterson were deemed 'college ready' based on their SAT scores, meaning they achieved at least 1,500 out of 2,400 points.

The average score obtained by a student in the area was just 1,200. It is a decrease on the 26 (4.2 per cent) who reached the benchmark last year.

Shocking: Exam results from the Paterson School District in New Jersey (headquarters pictured) revealed that only 19 out of 600 students scored enough to get into college 

Despite the worrying results, some education officials have insisted they are not concerned and have criticized exam boards for fielding questions that hurt minorities and female students. 

However others agreed that there was a problem and that the administration may have been 'hiding something'.  

Corey Teague, a school board member, told the Paterson Press suggest optimistic estimates of improved student scores may be inaccurate.

'That's a sign that they're hiding something,' he said. 'They like to brag that the scores are up when they're not.'

Terry Corall, a spokeswoman for the district, said the numbers are 'flat not down', in reference to last year's scores.

She said the difference in the total number of students who reached college-ready score was 'not much different from past years.'

'More importantly, this chart was referring to SAT's being used as a college-readiness benchmark,' Corallo added. 'But as we have discussed, there are many factors that play a part in college readiness.'

Rosie Grant, director of the Paterson Education Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group, told the paper: 'We certainly want our students to be college-ready... but I’m not too alarmed because these numbers are based on the SATs.

Paterson resident Jason Williams, who is one of the students who made it to college. He took the tests three times determined to get in, and told My9NJ that not falling victim to the streets helped him with his studies.

'Just last summer, my friend and teammate, he was shot and killed that summer and that really affected me,' he said.

The Paterson school district has since said they do not use SATs do gauge student success.
