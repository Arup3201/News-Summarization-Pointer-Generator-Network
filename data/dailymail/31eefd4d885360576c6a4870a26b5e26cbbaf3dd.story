Two sculptures that languished in obscurity for more than a century are to be unveiled today as the only surviving bronzes by Michelangelo

Two sculptures that languished in obscurity for more than a century are to be unveiled today as the only surviving bronzes by Michelangelo.

A team of international experts has used X-rays and a 500-year-old sketch to build a portfolio of evidence to back the case that they are the works of the Renaissance master.

The pair of sculptures – showing naked, muscular men riding triumphantly on two ferocious panthers – were made shortly after Michelangelo completed the marble David and as he was about to begin painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

Victoria Avery, keeper of the applied arts department of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, where the pair will go on public display tomorrow, said the sculptures had been attributed to Michelangelo following 'a Renaissance whodunnit' investigation.

'It has been fantastically exciting to have been able to participate in this ground-breaking project, which has involved input from many art historians in the UK, Europe and the States, and to draw on evidence from conservation scientists and anatomists,' she said.

'The bronzes are exceptionally powerful and compelling works of art that deserve close-up study. We hope the public will come and examine them for themselves and engage with this ongoing debate. It has been a huge privilege to be involved, very exciting and great fun.'

Known as the Rothschild Bronzes, the pieces are a metre tall and owned by a British private collector. One figure is older and lithe, the other young and athletic.

Dr Avery added: 'Whoever made them clearly had a profound interest in the male body ... the anatomy is perfect.'

The works were attributed to Michelangelo when they appeared in the collection of Adolphe de Rothschild in the 19th century.

But since they were undocumented and unsigned, this claim was dismissed and over the past 120 years the bronzes have been attributed to other sculptors.

But a neutron scan at a research institute in Switzerland placed the sculptures in the first decade of the 16th century.

And studies by Professor Peter Abrahams, a clinical anatomist at the University of Warwick, found the works bore all the hallmarks of Michelangelo.

Last autumn Paul Joannides, emeritus professor of art history at the University of Cambridge, connected the work to a drawing by one of Michelangelo's apprentices now in the Fabre museum of Montpellier.

In one corner is a composition of a muscular youth riding a panther, which is very similar in pose to the bronzes.

The bronzes were compared with other works by Michelangelo and found to be very similar in style and anatomy to his works of 1500-1510; a date confirmed by the preliminary conclusions of initial scientific analysis, including X-rays.

Research is continuing and the final conclusion will be presented in July. The bronzes will be on display until August 9.

The four original surviving copies of the Magna Carta have been brought together, pictured is 1215 painting 'King John And The Magna Carta'

The four original surviving copies of the Magna Carta have been brought together under the same roof for the first time.

The document - one of the first steps in the journey towards parliamentary democracy - will go on show at The British Library in central London as part of its 800th anniversary.

More than 40,000 people entered a public ballot for the chance to see them with 1,215 winning the opportunity to visit the display.

The documents will be at the library for three days before they are taken to the House of Lords for another day, before two are returned to the library and the others go back to their homes at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals.

In a joint statement, the library and the cathedrals said: 'King John could surely never have anticipated the enduring global legacy of Magna Carta when he agreed to its terms in 1215.

'Eight hundred years later, the international interest and excitement about this unification event is testament to the extraordinary significance and symbolic power of these four manuscripts.

'We are thrilled to be staging this moment in history together, as partners, at the start of the 800th anniversary year. For each of our institutions, this unique event marks the beginning of our own celebrations in 2015.

'The British Library, Lincoln Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral will all be staging exhibitions and events later this year to mark the 800th anniversary of the sealing of this iconic document.'
