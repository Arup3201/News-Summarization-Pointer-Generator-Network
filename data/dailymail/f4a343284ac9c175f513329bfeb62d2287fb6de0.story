As Cesc Fabregas prepares to face Arsenal with Chelsea this weekend, we asked Sportsmail's PHIL DUNCAN five questions about the Spaniard.

Will he be booed? Will he celebrate? And was Arsene Wenger right to stick with Mesut Ozil rather than bring Cesc back?

Cesc Fabregas will play for Chelsea against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge this Sunday

Fabregas learnt his trade and Arsenal and was the club captain... here are the questions that need answering

How do you feel about seeing Fabregas in Chelsea blue and how will the majority of Arsenal fans react to him at Stamford Bridge?

It’s been hard to watch Fabregas in the Chelsea strip and even harder to see him doing so well. 

You don’t get many more loathed teams or indeed fans at the Emirates than those who sport the blue. But should we feel distaste towards the Spaniard? No. 

He wanted a move back to London, and Arsenal didn’t want him. What did we expect him to do? Join Spurs? Come on, he wants to win trophies. 

But forget Robin van Persie, Ashley Cole, Samir Nasri and the rest… this reunion is the one which will hurt the Arsenal fans the most.

If he scores, do you expect him to celebrate, or show respect like Frank Lampard did to Chelsea supporters at Manchester City?

I think you’ve got more chance of seeing Wojciech Szczesny score the perfect hat-trick than Fabregas celebrating a goal against the club who made him what he is today. 

He’s admitted he is still a Gooner at heart and would rather have donned the red of Arsenal this season than the blue of Chelsea after quitting Barcelona; that’s probably why the Chelsea fans don’t like him very much. 

Let’s just say that if he does do the unthinkable and score against his former employers, I’m confident he won’t do an ‘Adebayor’ and sprint the length of the pitch before sliding on his knees to antagonise the away fans. He’s better than that. Most people are.

Frank Lampard was respectful after scoring against Chelsea... expect the same from Cesc

There will be no chance of Fabregas replicating Emmanuel Adebayor and running the length of the pitch...

What are your favourite memories of Cesc in an Arsenal shirt?

Giving the Juventus trio of Emerson, Mauro Camoranesi and his mentor Patrick Vieira the runaround at Highbury before scoring and then teeing up Thierry Henry in Arsenal’s 2-0 win in the Champions League last eight will be somewhere near the top of the list. 

‘He’s only 18, he’s better than Roy Keane,’ sung the Arsenal fans, and he certainly came of age that night. 

Staying in Europe his late spot-kick against Barcelona – scored on one leg after sustaining an injury winning the penalty – as Arsenal rallied back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at the Emirates in 2010. 

And, who can forget his solo strike against Tottenham where he snatched the ball on the halfway line to score against the arch enemy?

Fabregas had many great moments at Arsenal: including this when he gave Juventus the runaround in 2006

Are Arsenal better with – or without – Cesc in their midfield?

This is a difficult question. We never wanted him to leave; he was our captain, talisman, and fans’ favourite, but how many medals can the Spaniard claim to have won at Arsenal? A solitary FA Cup triumph in 2005, and that was a fortunate win, on penalties against a Manchester United side far superior on the day. 

Undoubtedly a star player, who stood head and shoulders above his peers, but he is also one who personified a different Arsene Wenger era – a move away from the power of Petit, Vieira, Henry and Co and one built around slighter, diminutive players – albeit as skilful – but which ultimately has proved to be nowhere near as successful.

Ozil or Fabregas? Who would you rather have directing operations for your team right now?

Based on current form Fabregas, but is he a better player than Ozil? I’m not sure. Is his game more suited to the Premier League, however? Probably. 

That said I understand why Wenger didn’t move for Fabregas in the summer. He and Ozil could not have played in the same side, and when you’ve spent a club record fee on a player why would you undermine that by bringing in someone who lines up in the same position? Nor can we forget Aaron Ramsey’s breakthrough campaign last year. 

Would it have been as a step back to sign Fabregas? I think so. 

Nevertheless, he’s still a class act, a player who has delivered consistently in England, whether it was at Arsenal or now in the early stages of his career at Chelsea, and oozes star quality. 

Let’s hope he has an off-day on Sunday.

Mesut Ozil is as good a player as Fabregas if not better, but the latter is better suited to the Premier League 

A move for Fabregas would have been a step backwards... Arsene Wenger has done all he can
