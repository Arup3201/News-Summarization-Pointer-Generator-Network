A jilted boyfriend shot dead his ex-girlfriend and two other guests at an intimate New Year's Eve party in France before turning the shotgun on himself.

The bloodbath took place in a terraced house in Sainte-Catherine, close to Arras, in northern France, where seven people had gathered to see in 2015. 

The man, a 45-year-old community nurse, shot dead his girlfriend and two men in their 50s and injured two others - one of which is in intensive care in Lille Hospital, at about 1am today.

He had turned up at around 1am saying he wanted to speak to his ex-girlfriend.

Local prosecutor Adam Chodkiewiez said the man, who has a history of domestic violence, had been invited but turned up at the small family gathering with a gun. 

He said: ‘He immediately attacked his ex-girlfriend. Two people tried to intervene, and that’s when the gunfire started.’

Three were killed and two injured, and two other guests managed to escape the horrific scene. They were treated for severe shock and ‘minor injuries’ 

The man fled the terraced house and was chased by police and then turned the shotgun on himself 

After he shot his girlfriend the man killed two others and left two guests injured, one seriously wounded 

After he carried out the string of killings the gunman drove away in his car, an Austin Mini. 

He was chased by police and parked in a car park near a hospital in Arras before fleeing. The man then shot himself. 

Mr Chodkiewiez, who said a judicial inquiry into the causes of death had been opened. 

The nurse, who has not yet been named, had a history of domestic violence, and was spoken to by police in 2013 for attacking a partner. 

Neighbours in the normally quiet cul-de-sac told France’s AFP news agency said they had raised the alarm after hearing shots. 

The shooting took place at about 1am today during an intimate New Year's Eve party in Sainte Catherine 

Police said a judicial inquiry would be opened into the deaths, which shocked residents in the quiet street

Police have remained on guard outside the small terraced house in a quiet residential street, near Arras 

‘I was told there was a man on the run with a shotgun – he had murdered two or three people,’ said one, identified only as Celine. 

Another neighbour said: ‘This is a very quiet, peaceful area – there is never any trouble. We are all in a state of absolute shock. You just don’t expect this kind of thing to happen over the holidays.’ 

A security cordon was set up around the house at 4am this morning, as detectives including forensics experts compiled evidence. 

Officers said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the crime, and that the names of victims would be released ‘once all identifies have been confirmed.’
