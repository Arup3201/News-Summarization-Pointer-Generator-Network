For more than half a century, the sprawling 400-acre site on the outskirts of the Kent town of Sandwich was a world-renowned centre of medical discovery.

There, housed within laboratories bursting with high-tech equipment, a 2,500-strong team of scientists researched and developed drugs that would treat everything from tropical diseases to erectile dysfunction.

Today, three years after the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer handed that army of brilliant minds their P45s, the site is now a business park where the breaking news is the imminent arrival of a Sainsbury’s supermarket.

While the 200 jobs it will bring are not to be sniffed at, it goes without saying that they will not be of the same calibre — or pay-grade — as those that went before.

And while the locals might find the out-of-town store convenient, that will not compensate for the economic impact the closure of the Pfizer plant has had on the economy of Sandwich.

Across this historic town, everything from hotels to bookshops, from the summer festival to the Christmas decorations, was hit by the American corporation’s decision to slash its British operation to the bone in 2011.

It is against this background that residents view Pfizer’s latest assault on a British company — and needless to say, they view it with a healthy degree of scepticism.

Last week, the U.S. company tabled a  £63 billion bid for AstraZeneca, Britain’s second-biggest pharmaceutical company. If it goes ahead, it would represent the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a UK firm. But there are growing concerns over what the deal would mean for British workers, and for the crucial research and development work they carry out.

In a bid to address these fears, Pfizer’s chief executive Ian Read wrote to the PM to guarantee jobs while pledging to complete a substantial research and development facility in Cambridge.

But while David Cameron welcomed the assurances as ‘robust’, there is widespread concern that his position may be compromised by the fact that Pfizer’s PR and lobbying campaign is being led by a firm chaired by a close friend.

Back in Sandwich, Mark Moorhouse, a town councillor and chair of the local Chamber of Commerce, says: ‘When Pfizer left it was devastating for the town. Now we are hearing rhetoric about them wanting to invest in Britain again.

‘But how can there be all this talk when they had a perfectly good bespoke site here which they suddenly decided to pull out of? For a lot of people, it simply doesn’t make sense.’

Take a stroll through the winding streets of Sandwich and beside the tea-rooms and antique shops, and you’ll find that the scars left by Pfizer are still raw. In King Street, a stunning Grade II-listed shop stands empty but for some of the original Edwardian fixtures and fittings.

Until three years ago, it was home to a highly successful independent bookstore employing four people. But when Pfizer announced it was to slash its workforce, the store ran into difficulties almost overnight.

‘Pfizer employees accounted for 30 to 40 per cent of our sales and we saw a slump after they announced the closure,’ said then-owner Louise Vance. ‘My friends from the company said they were sorry, but the situation was so uncertain they had stopped spending until they knew their fate.’

Further evidence of what exactly their ‘fate’ would be can be seen at the site of the former Pfizer facility on the outskirts of Sandwich.

Today it has been renamed Discovery Park and relaunched as a ‘global hub for science, technology, business and enterprise’.

But while it has had some success in attracting new companies into the area, the void left by Pfizer is plain for all to see. Once, this was the largest pharmaceutical research centre outside the U.S., but today huge empty car parks bear testimony to what happened on February 1, 2011.

‘On that day we had a town council meeting about the Open Golf Championship coming to Sandwich that year,’ recalls Mr Moorhouse. ‘But as soon as the news broke it spread around the town in an instant. So what should have been a meeting with a celebratory mood became like a morgue — the impact was immediate.’

Initially, it was believed Pfizer would shut down the facility completely. But while in the end some 650 staff were retained at Sandwich, it wasn’t just the people that Pfizer employed directly whose livelihoods were threatened. Mr Moorhouse estimates that some 3,000 people indirectly depended on the company for the lions’ share of their income — everyone from cleaning contractors to taxi firms.

‘I remember going out for a curry to celebrate my birthday about a week before Pfizer made the announcement, and the local Indian was packed with people from Pfizer,’ says Mr Moorhouse.

‘Without their business, the pubs and restaurants, in particular, have seen a big dip in their takings.’Among those to have suffered is Chris Ash, owner of the Fisherman’s Wharf restaurant, on the Quay by the River Stour, the closest restaurant to the Pfizer site.

‘It was all very sudden when they went,’ he said. ‘There were no rumours or talk beforehand. So the town was taken aback by what happened. They were a wealthy company who were very generous and then suddenly it stopped. We got a lot of people in for lunch and dinner — particularly business lunches — so we felt the full draught of the exodus.

‘The main problem here is we have 28 pubs and restaurants all competing for a smaller cake, and for the first six months we very definitely felt the loss of trade ... our profits for December were down 25 per cent because Pfizer had around a dozen Christmas parties here.’ Heather Lemoine, landlady of the Admiral Owen pub, also said business had suffered — and not just behind the bar.

‘The biggest effect has been on the buy-to-let housing market,’ she said. ‘A lot of people bought houses and rented them out to Pfizer people. When Pfizer went, the rental incomes disappeared.’

The company is seeking approval to buy AstraZeneca

Like others in Sandwich, she has been following Pfizer’s takeover bid with interest. And she is unconvinced by the promise to invest in a combined Pfizer-Astra research centre in Cambridge.

‘Why did they build a “mini-city” here and then just go?’ she asks. ‘I fear the same thing might happen in Cambridge.’

Financial analysts would answer her question by pointing out that Pfizer has not achieved global success without being ruthless.

It is a point made by John Bragg, a one-time Pfizer scientist and former mayor of Sandwich, who is currently a town councillor.

He helped set up Pfizer’s first lab in 1955 and says the decision to shut Sandwich reflects a no-nonsense approach to making money.

‘They hadn’t had anything new out of Sandwich for ten years, and Pfizer are not a company to reinforce failure,’ said Mr Bragg. ‘You don’t keep things going which are losing money for you, so what were they to do?

‘Of course we made our representations to Pfizer at the time and they explained that it was part of a global policy, that they were reducing hugely the amount of money they were spending on research.

They didn’t do that because there was successful research going on, it was because there wasn’t.’And what about Cambridge, might the same happen there?

Mr Bragg thinks it is ‘improbable’ that Pfizer would not carry through with the initial investment, but adds that if, in ten years, the facility was not delivering it would be ‘a different story’.

And he, like his fellow residents, knows just how big an impact that can have on every aspect of a local community. ‘We were proud of the fact that the company had such a presence in Sandwich — they did have a profound effect on the whole of the area,’ he says.

‘Not only did they employ a lot of people, who had a lot of money to spend locally, but there was also a knock-on effect socially because these people were involved in all sorts of activities in the town.’

Not only did Pfizer sponsor the Christmas lights and the tourist information bureau, it gave financial support to the town’s popular summer festival. When Pfizer left, those holes had to be filled.

Of course, the biggest hole was that which the departing staff left behind on the outskirts of Sandwich — their offices, laboratories and support facilities. While the remaining 650 Pfizer staff still occupy a corner of the site, the rest of the business park is far from full.

With support from central government the plan is to create 3,000 jobs there by 2017. So far, it has achieved less than half that number, with a few more to come if the new Sainsbury’s is given the green light.

‘Sainsbury’s will play a key role in regenerating the site and help achieve the vision for Discovery Park to become a world-leading employment location and a pioneer of innovation, providing a range of great benefits to Sandwich,’ said Discovery Park managing director Paul Barber, somewhat predictably.

Nice spin, but for the people of Sandwich it will take more than words to forget the day they discovered how big business really works: a lesson that should not be buried beneath Pfizer’s billions, or its promises to AstraZeneca and the Government as it tries to wrest control.
