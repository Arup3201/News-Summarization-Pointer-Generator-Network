Women desperate to have a baby now have access to a national sperm bank.

The centre, based at Birmingham Women’s hospital, will be open to both NHS and private patients undergoing fertility treatment.

They will be able to choose a donor from an online catalogue which contains detailed information about the male donor’s height, hair colour, ethnicity, career and hobbies.

It will charge between £300 and £400 per sample, although some women will be able to get this for free on the NHS if their local area agrees to fund it.

The bank – which has received £77,000 of money from the Department of Health – aims to address a national shortage of donors.

A new national sperm bank has opened offering single women, gay couples and those left infertile by cancer treatment the chance to conceive 

The centre, which is based at Birmingham Women's Hospital, has received £77,000 in funding from the Department of Health and aims to address the national shortage of donors 

This has partly been brought about by a growing demand from single women wanting to start a family without a male partner and lesbian couples.

But it also includes those whose husbands or boyfriends have undergone cancer treatment rendering them infertile.

Some women who want to have a baby using donated sperm have been routinely waiting for up to two years, with many eventually forced to ‘import it’ from donors abroad.

And the majority of men are white which has left women from other ethnicities struggling to find a donor.

Until now, sperm has been banked locally at fertility clinics, leading to a patchy service and waiting times of up to two years in some areas.

This has led to some women going abroad for treatment while others have gone online to find a donor, putting themselves at risk to HIV and other infections. 

The national sperm bank aims to have recruited donors 1,000 donors within just three years, who will be paid £35 per donation.

Dr Sue Avery, the director of the Birmingham Women's Fertility Centre, said: ‘The idea of the campaign is to focus on sperm donation as a tremendously positive thing to do and that the men who do this are very special.

Women can browse the sperm bank's database to choose their done. It will cost around £300 to £400 per sample, while some local health authorities will fund treatment 

‘They're helping to build families.

‘We're spending this money to start something that we hope will grow to the point where nobody has to import sperm.’

Figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority show that fertility clinics in Britain are increasingly relying on importing sperm from abroad.

The numbers of overseas sperm donors registering to provide samples each year has increased from less than 50 in 2005 to just under 200 last year.

Meanwhile the number of British men registering fell last year from a peak of 450 to 400.

Dr Allan Pacey, the chair of the British Fertility Society said: ‘We are importing as a nation more and more sperm from overseas, without being xenophobic it kind of just doesn't feel right, it's a problem that's not going away.

‘Also I think there will always be some patients who, with regards to sperm donors, will want an individual that is more closely related to them in culture and language and outlook.’
