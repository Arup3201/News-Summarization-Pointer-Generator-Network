Electronic ink printed on a plastic film has been used to make a transparent keyboard that can play music.

Scientists have demonstrated a new method of printing graphene-based ink on the flexible instrument, which they say could be used to make inexpensive printed electronics.

They believe graphene could be used in printed electronic devices such as heart monitors and other thin sensors.

The scientists designed their piano in collaboration with Novalia Limited. Here, a paper print-out of piano keys with the correct spacing, is placed beneath the plastic keyboard to make it look more conventional

Dr Tawfique Hasan, Dr Felice Torrisi and Professor Andrea 
Ferrari at the University of Cambridge's Graphene Centre, invented the graphene-based ink and said just like graphene, the material has a number of 
interesting properties, including flexibility, optical transparency, and
electrical conductivity.

The scientists designed their piano in collaboration with Novalia Limited and its keys are made from graphene-based inks, which have been printed onto a plastic film.

These keys, working as electrodes, are connected to a simple electronic 
circuit-board, a battery and speaker.

When a person touches a graphene 
electrode, the amount of electrical charge held in the key changes.

This
is then detected and redirected by the circuit to the speaker, creating
the musical note.

Other
conductive inks are made from precious metals such as silver, which 
makes them very expensive to produce and process, whereas graphene is 
both cheap, environmentally stable and does not require much processing
after printing.

The scientists believe graphene could be used in printed electronic devices such as heart monitors and other thin displays (a prototype is pictured right). The flexible material is similar to graphene (pictured left) and has a number of 
interesting properties, including flexibility, optical transparency, and
electrical conductivity

The scientists said graphene ink is superior to conductive polymers in
terms of cost, stability and performance.

The research team have also developed a flexible prototype digital display, which uses 
conventional printable materials, but with a transparent, electrically 
conductive graphene layer on top.

The graphene layer is not only flexible but also more conductive and transparent than the conventional 
polymer it replaces.

They believe the simple displays can be used in a wide range 
of smart packaging applications such as toys, labelling and board games.

'Both of these devices
show how graphene could be printed on to a whole range of surfaces, 
which makes it ideal for printed electronics,' Dr Hasan, the lead 
researcher behind the prototypes, said.

'For example, it might eventually
be possible to print electronics on to clothing and to make wearable 
patches to monitor people with health conditions, such as a heart 
problem,' he added.

Another potential application of the technology could be cheap, printable sensors, which could be used 
to track luggage around an airport to ensure it is loaded on to the 
correct plane, or to follow products across a production and supply 
chain, the team said.

Each printed laser (pictured) can be designed to give out its own, unique optical signature, which its team of creators hope will prevent the sale of counterfeit goods

A separate team of researchers at the University has created a detection device that uses printed lasers to identify counterfeit goods, which could help make products ranging from banknotes to designer handbags more resistant to fraud.

Dr Damian Gardiner, who led the project, said the anti-fraud detector 
demonstrates an approach that could be employed to identify fake 
pharmaceuticals and currency, as well as high-value goods. 

It works by 
exploiting an existing method for printing liquid crystal lasers with 
inkjet printers, which gives the user a very precise level of control 
over the laser’s pattern and colour combination.

The
detector takes advantage of this by shining a second, laser pulse onto
the printed one.

It then reads the wavelength of the light emission 
from the printed laser through a piece of dedicated software and reproduces that
reading as a pattern on a spectrograph.

Lasers can be printed on to all sorts of surfaces, including plastic, paper, metal and glass, the technique could be used to authenticate a wide range of products. Here a scientist demonstrates how the technology could be used to detect fake banknotes

The
result is that each printed laser can be designed to give out its own, 
unique optical signature.

Because lasers can be printed on to all sorts 
of surfaces, including plastic, paper, metal and glass, the technique 
could be used to authenticate a wide range of products.

Dr Gardiner said:'Every
year, hundreds of thousands of people are sold fake pharmaceuticals 
under the mistaken belief that they will help them, while counterfeit 
products cost companies hundreds of billions of pounds.'

'We think that our printed lasers could be used to protect both 
products and people.'

The
prototypes were developed within the University’s Electrical 
Engineering Division and the teams are now working with partners in 
industry with a view to bringing them into commercial use.
