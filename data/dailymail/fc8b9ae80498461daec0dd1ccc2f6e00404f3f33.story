The former Oregon State University who filmed a porn video in the school's library has launched a sugar daddy dating site for broke college girls.

Kendra Sunderland, 19, of Corvallis, Oregon, writes on the site, called Date Broke College Girls, 'I created this site to match college girls like me who are struggling to pay for school and looking for a rich older boyfriend. Hopefully this will keep them from getting naked in the library and help them use it to study!'

She also said she created the site to help women feel 'empowered'

'I wanted to create a place online where young women can feel empowered, and meet successful individuals that can help them during a very stressful and challenging time,' she said in an interview with Coed.

'I’m personally a member of the sugar dating community, and have seen the benefits these relationships provide a young woman firsthand. Everyone benefits from having a mentor that can help you navigate challenges, especially ones they’ve overcome themselves – like managing student debts and starting a career.' 

It is the also the first site of its kind to be run by a 'sugar baby.' 

This after Sunderland made a video last October for the site MyFreeCams, and in it was seen topless at times and also touching herself, all while students walked around her in the school library, completely unaware of the young woman's video.

Then, in January, someone uploaded the video to the popular site PornHub, making Sunderland an instant celebrity in the adult film world as the video received close to 300,000 views in just a few days before being taken down.

And while her parents may be upset and the young woman was cited with public indecency, Kendra is hoping the hype around her library escapades is just what she needs to launch a modelling career.

The idea to start doing videos on MyFreeCams, which features women doing live webcam shows in which they can make money as viewers tip them with virtual tokens they buy from the site, came after Sundelrand could not find a waitressing job near campus. 

She did her first webcam video in October, and in an hour had made $150 - and earned plenty of compliments.

'Working a minimum wage job, there’s people that are just mean to you when they’re having a crappy day,' she told the Daily News. 

'On MyFreeCams, [users] had nothing but nice things to say. And I made way more than I would working any other job.'

She started making videos regularly at her home while her roommates were out, including one in which she had sex with a former boyfriend, and then, at the suggestion of one of the site's users, decided to take her show to a public place.

That is when she made the library video, which earned her $700 for about an hour, and within a few weeks she had made the decision to drop out of college and focus on making videos for the site.

Then, in January, she was sitting in her room when she began getting a barrage of friend requests from 'frat boys,' and then, after checking the gossip app YikYak, learned that everyone was talking about the 'library girl.'

Her mother also began receiving messages around that time as well, as concerned friends started asking about her daughter, and while there was some relief Sunderland explains when her mother learned she had just filmed a video and had not been hurt, the mother still told her daughter; 'This is just something you can learn a lesson from and move on.'

That is not what Sunderland intends to do however, a decision that has now made her parents 'upset' she reveals, as the offers are not pouring in for the young woman, and she just completed her first professional photo shoot.

One thing people will not be seeing Sunderland do anymore however is webcam shows on MyFreeCams - the site has now banned her for violating their guidelines with her library clip. 

She is also banned from the Oregon State campus and last week was arrested and cited with public indecency before being released.

As for how the video made its way to PornHub, Sunderland says she has 'no clue.'
