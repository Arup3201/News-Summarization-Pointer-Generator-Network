Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff is still due to attend this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix despite sustaining a number of fractures in a cycling accident on Tuesday.

On a team-bonding exercise along the river Danube in Vienna, several members of the F1 team - but not including drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg - were involved in the incident.

Wolff received treatment in a local hospital for a fractured wrist - which required a pin - elbow, shoulder and collarbone, whilst executive technical director Paddy Lowe escaped with only cuts and bruises.

A Mercedes spokesperson has confirmed Wolff is in 'good spirits', and will arrive at the Hungaroring at some point over the weekend following a further day or two to recuperate.

Via Twitter, Wolff joked: 'We've decided to leave it to the pros now. Lewis & Nico are better wheel to wheel at 300 km/h than we are at 30 km/h!'

Wolff's wife Susie, currently Williams development driver, via her account added: 'My husband the hero! As we know, boys will be boys... Looks like I am on nurse duty for the next few weeks!'

Susie added a picture of her husband with his right arm in plaster and a sling.
