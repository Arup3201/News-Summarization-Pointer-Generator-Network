The couple are again opening their garden up to the public later this month as part of the National Gardens Scheme, with proceeds going to various cancer charities

Mrs Newton said: 'It's good to put Walsall and the West Midlands on the international garden map. We have derived immense pleasure from doing this huge project together without outside help.'

Mrs Newton created the amazing garden, which this year benefited from one of the warmest Septembers on record, after retiring from her job as a transport planner and taught herself horticulture.

She explained: 'It's good to put Walsall and the West Midlands on the international garden map. We have derived immense pleasure from doing this huge project together without outside help.

'It has been very satisfying to use so many skills, and to have done every task ourselves. 

'All but two of all the plants in our garden have been planted by us.'

Mrs Newton explained: 'It has been very satisfying to use so many skills, and to have done every task ourselves. All but two of all the plants in our garden have been planted by us.'

The Newtons are preparing to welcome 350 more people over two days, with Mrs Newton saying: 'We sometimes get more and sometimes less. We are hoping for some good weather. We are just as keen as ever.'

Mrs Newton said: 'It's an autumn garden so people can expect brilliant reds, oranges and yellows. There will be azalea and acer leaves along with the evergreen conifers.'

Mr Newton said: 'You have got all these colours now. It's amazing this year. Really, we do feel proper autumn is about these foliage colours. Autumn is a glorious time. It is a delight.'

Mr Newton, a retired GP who has helped make the garden so spectacular, explained: 'We all know it's been a warm, sunny September so it was a delight.'At the same time, the autumn colours are coming.'

Now the couple, who have four grown-up children and one granddaughter, are opening their garden up to the public later this month as part of the National Gardens Scheme. 

Their garden has already raised more than £34,000 for the scheme and welcomed 10,700 visitors since 2006. Proceeds from the scheme go to charities Marie Curie Cancer Care and Macmillan Cancer Support.

Thanks to the hard work of Mr and Mrs Newton, the garden has been transformed from how it looked in 1985, and has been visited by people from 28 different countries

 This photo from 1992 shows how the garden started to change over the years with new flowers and trees, but it still some way short from how it looks today

Hidden treasure: The neatly trimmed bushes at the front of the Newtons' home in Walsall only hints at the magnificent colours and flowers to be seen in their back garden

Mrs Newton said: 'It's an autumn garden so people can expect brilliant reds, oranges and yellows.

'There will be azalea and acer leaves along with the evergreen conifers.

'Over two days we can get 350 people but it is dependent on the weather. We sometimes get more and sometimes less.

'We are hoping for some good weather. We are just as keen as ever.

'It's been wonderful the visitors we've had in the past. They have come from 28 different countries in addition to the UK.'
