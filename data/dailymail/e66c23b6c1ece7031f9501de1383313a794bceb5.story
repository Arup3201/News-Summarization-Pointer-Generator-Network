Green entrepreneur David Green, 52, hanged himself at his home on the Isle of Wight after he was arrested over false allegations of fraud, an inquest heard today

A green entrepreneur hanged himself after he was arrested over false allegations he had pocketed £115,000 of taxpayers' cash, an inquest heard.

Keen yachtsman David Green, 52, left a note criticising police who arrested him on suspicion of fraud before he took his own life in the grounds of his family's eco-home outside Cowes on the Isle of Wight, the hearing was told.

The award-winning businessman, who 'aimed to turn the Isle of Wight green' with his self-sufficiency firm, Ecoisland, was devastated after news of his arrest was leaked to the local paper.

But the inquest in Newport heard charges would never have been brought against the father of two, as the arrest was based upon a misreading of financial documents by an employee at Isle of Wight Council.

The court was told that Mr Green was assumed to have pocketed £115,000 of 'green grants' after council workers found the sum was unaccounted for after Ecoisland collapsed.

Instead, it emerged that the cash had simply been swallowed up in the running costs of his ambitious eco venture, designed to make the island self-sufficient.

Mr Green's widow, Patricia, 59, told a coroner how her husband was 'devastated' after being arrested on 3 October last year.

She said: 'David had described the experience as the most humiliating and degrading in his whole life.

'He was a very honest and honourable man, so the thought of being questioned, and hearing someone at the police station call him "the prisoner" hit him hard.'

Mr Green had told 
interviewing officers 'I’m finished' after he was arrested and quizzed 
for three hours at Newport Police Station, the 
inquest heard.

Describing her husband as a 'proud man who had achieved so much in his life', Mrs Green added: 'The day after David was arrested, the story was on the front page of the County Press...

'It just threw him.  He said "I'm not going to be able to walk down the road, I'm going to be a pariah."'

She said she found her husband hanging in the grounds of their house as she returned from a walk with a friend on 7 October.

Mr Green left a lengthy suicide note condemning the detectives who had questioned him.

He wrote: 'They clearly did not believe a word I said and treated me like a criminal. No compassion or innocence before guilt there, I’m afraid.'

Mr Green, who was chief executive of the UK Sailing Association for 20 years, had won numerous awards after converting his large family home near Cowes into the most eco-friendly property on the island.

He launched the Ecoisland Community Interest Company to make the Isle of Wight the first self-sustainable region in the UK, and the venture was backed by industry heavyweights including Cable and Wireless, IBM and Toshiba.

Isle of Wight Council also gave him £240,000 of a Government cash grant towards the scheme.

However,
 the business ran into financial difficulties and went into 
administration in late September last year, prompting the Greens to 
decide to sell their home and 'start again', the inquest heard.

Ambitious: Mr Green aimed to make the Isle of Wight self-sufficient with his green Ecoisland venture

The following week, Isle of Wight Council told police that £115,000 of government funding was unaccounted for - a conclusion they reached after going through Ecoisland financial spreadsheets.

But Detective Constable Lee Stewart, of the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Police fraud unit, told the inquest: 'The money had simply been swallowed up in the money problems of the organisation.  There is nothing to suggest it was fraudulently obtained.'

He added: 'The factually incorrect spreadsheet - as perceived by the council - was in fact a misinterpretation of the material.'

 

'Mr Green was a decent man who had some financial problems, but there is no evidence... of dishonesty and that is the thing he would have struggled with most'

  Coroner Caroline Sumeray

Caroline Sumeray, the senior coroner for the Isle of Wight, recorded a verdict of suicide and told the hearing in Newport: 'I’m very sorry to hear the sad tale behind this case.'

Speaking to Mrs Green and her younger child, Luke, 29, the coroner said it was 'horrendous' for them discover Mr Green 'felt driven to this by the humiliation he felt because he was arrested, because he was interviewed, because of the allegation that was made that was incorrect, false, inaccurate.'

She added: 'I can’t begin to imagine how you are feeling.'

The coroner said the police had acted 'properly' in investigating Mr Green following the allegation made by Isle of Wight Council, but criticised the council for releasing news of the arrest to the local newspaper prematurely.

'I trust there will be a full investigation and appropriate action taken against whoever provided this information,' said Mrs Sumeray.

She added that Mr Green was 'a decent man who had some financial problems - but there is no evidence on the papers of dishonesty and that is the thing he would have struggled with most.'
