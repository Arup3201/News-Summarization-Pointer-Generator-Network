More than a quarter of MPs have billed the taxpayer for first-class rail travel in the past year - despite a supposed crackdown on the practice.

A study of MPs' expenses yesterday revealed that 185 had claimed for first-class rail tickets rather than travel in standard class.

Those involved include Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Cabinet Office Minister Norman Baker, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and his wife, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.

The claims were made by 113 Labour MPs, 48 Conservatives, 19 Liberal Democrats, three Scottish National Party and two Plaid Cymru members.

Ten members of Ed Miliband’s front-bench team are among the Labour claimants.

The findings came as the Government tried to play down embarrassment over Chancellor George Osborne’s decision to travel in a first-class carriage after purchasing a standard ticket on Friday.

His office insisted he had always intended to pay for the upgrade and that an aide had sought out the train manager to do so.

He is alleged to have found himself in the same situation in May, when he was also caught with a standard ticket in First Class.

However, on that occasion he is said to have refused to pay the upgrade and instead 'slummed it' with ordinary travellers in economy class for the rest of the journey between London and his constituency in Tatton, Cheshire.

A commuter who was on the train in May told the Sunday Mirror: 'Mr Osborne was confronted in first class by an inspector. The official seemed a bit embarrassed by the whole thing but quite correctly he treated Mr Osborne like anyone else.

'After a short discussion Mr Osborne gathered up his things and moved to a different carriage and slummed it with everyone else.

'I was a bit shocked to see the Chancellor trying to blag a cheap seat. I'd have thought with the money he has that he could afford the ticket.'

After getting off the train George Osborne was confronted by journalists who had seen a string of tweets about the fiasco

But a television reporter travelling 
on the same train claimed that the aide had actually got into a 
confrontation with an inspector over whether he should have moved to 
standard.

According to 
The Sunday Telegraph’s analysis, some of the first-class ticket claims 
have cost as much as £300, five times as much as the cheapest standard 
fare for the same route.

Ipsa's
guidelines on travel expenses suggest MPs should consider ‘value for 
money’ and whether cheaper, inflexible tickets will end up costing more 
if travel arrangements change at short notice.

‘You can claim for first-class travel if it is less than the cost of a standard open fare,’ it states.

First-class tickets purchased far 
enough in advance can end up cheaper than open standard tickets bought 
shortly before the journey.

But
Taxpayers' Alliance chief executive Matthew Sinclair said: ‘If MPs can 
get themselves organised to order a first-class ticket in advance, they 
should be able to order a standard-class ticket in plenty of time as 
well and it will almost always be cheaper.

‘If standard-class travel isn't good enough for MPs, it isn't good enough for ordinary commuters who pay for their own tickets.’

George
Osborne was forced to hand over nearly £200 by a railway ticket 
inspector during his trip on the 3.11pm Virgin Trains service from 
Wilmslow, Cheshire, to London Euston this week.

Rachel Townsend, a journalist with Granada TV, tweeted from the train: ‘Very interesting train journey to Euston Chancellor George Osborne just got on at Wilmslow with a STANDARD ticket and he has sat in FIRST CLASS.

‘His aide tells ticket collector he cannot possibly move and sit with the likes of us in standard class and requests he is allowed to remain in First Class. Ticket collector refuses.’

Her account was disputed by sources close to Mr Osborne, who insisted there was never any question of him not paying for the upgrade – and it came to £189.90 for the two tickets.

The source said: ‘The Chancellor got a different train than planned due to a diary change following a series of meetings in his constituency.

‘As he had no seat reservation on the new train which was crowded, he decided to upgrade – and obviously intended and was happy to pay. An aide sorted the ticket upgrade.’
