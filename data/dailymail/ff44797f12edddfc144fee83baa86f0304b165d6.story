An 82-year-old woman who repeatedly stabbed her husband of 36 years in the back with her sewing scissors because she wrongly believed he was having an affair, has been jailed for four-and-a-half years.

Elizabeth Stokes, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, 'ambushed' her husband John, 69, in the middle of the night, stabbing him 13 times and puncturing both of his lungs.

He staggered to the bathroom, bleeding profusely, and she followed before telling him he had no means of escape because she had hidden his keys and phone, a court heard.

Mr Stokes only managed to get help after shouting loudly out of the bathroom window to alert a neighbour, who called 999.

After a four day trial at Gloucester Crown Court, a jury today convicted Stokes of wounding her husband with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm.

However, she was cleared of a charge of attempted murder. She had denied both charges.

Jailing her, Judge Jamie Tabor QC said she remained 'fixated' with the idea that her husband had been unfaithful and she would therefore still be a danger to him when she leaves prison.

He made an indefinite restraining order banning her from contacting her husband in any way.

Stokes had told the jury that she believed her husband had two affairs during their marriage and was still seeing another woman at the time of the attack on July 27.

He had been getting Viagra from the doctor and she believed he had a second phone to speak to his mistress, she said.

She claimed she suddenly 'snapped' on the day of the attack and grabbed the scissors to stab him as he returned to bed from the bathroom.

However, Judge Tabor said it was a 'deliberate and planned ambushing' and that she had put her sewing scissors in the bedroom in readiness for the attack.

Mr Stokes, who spent eight days in hospital and made a full recovery, told prosecutors before the trial that he did not want to see her jailed and would go back to her.

Mrs Stokes, who has short grey hair and wore a blue patterned woollen cardigan and grey trousers, sat in the dock and listened intently with a hearing loop as Judge Tabor passed sentence.

He told her: 'On the outside to observers your marriage to Mr Stokes appeared to be peaceful and loving.

'But on the inside - what you called indoors - you were seething with resentment of your husband.

'You had a fixation and almost certainly a delusion that he was being unfaithful to you but your resentment went much further than that.

'You described him as a very good actor who was devious, sly and spiteful. You described him as a Jekyll and Hyde character, very jealous and a complete coward.

'That was not a delusion - that was the way you felt about the man you lived with for 36 years.

'That resentment grew and grew in your mind until the time came when you planned to assault him very seriously indeed.

'You lay in wait for him while he went to the lavatory. You sprang out at him and started to stab him in the back with a pair of scissors which I suspect you had got for the job.

'When he turned around you stabbed him high up on his body causing both lungs to be penetrated.

'Although I am not a doctor I suspect some of those injuries were not far from the heart.

'He could have died but you showed remarkable callousness once you had caused those injuries, leaving him to bleed in the bath and making remarks like 'No-one's going to hear you.'

The judge said he had taken her age into account, as well as her previous good character.

He also made allowances for fact her son Brian died in an accident last year, and said he had taken into account the effect it had on her.

He said: 'This is a quite extraordinary case. It is one of a type which does not come before the courts very often and it of course poses problems for a sentencing judge.

'Your age, your good character, your diminutive size all mean sentencing has to be outside the guidelines for this kind of case.'

He said that a defendant of normal age who committed such an offence could expect a 12-year term.

Rupert Lowe, defending, had told the judge: 'Mrs Stokes is by far the oldest person in Eastwood Park Prison [where she has been on remand since the offence].

'She never expected to be there and none of the staff ever expected to see a lady like her.

'She has undoubtedly learned the error of her ways and how serious what she did was. She is not in a position where she would ever do that again in my submission, even in the very unlikely event they were back together.'

Judge Tabor said: 'I suspect he would have her back as quick as a flash if indeed he genuinely loves her as he said he did.

'He is obviously a very forgiving man and if he felt she didn't pose a threat - and he would be the worst judge of that - he would have her back.'

Mr Lowe submitted that it was 'not the most serious' wounding of its kind but the judge retorted: 'He nearly died. If he had not been able to shout out of the window to get help he might have done.'

At the start of the trial, prosecutor Julian Kesner said she had clearly planned to stab her husband because she had taken the scissors to the bedroom and hidden his keys and phone.

As she started to stab Mr Stokes, he asked her 'What are you doing this for?' and she replied: 'You have ruined my life because of these affairs.'

When Mr Stokes ran to the bathroom and stood in the bath with blood pouring from his wounds she told him: 'You're trapped. The phone's gone. Your keys are gone and you've got no means of escape.'

Mr Kesner continued: 'Losing blood, getting weaker, he called out of the bathroom window to the neighbours. Her response was 'No-one's going to hear you. It's the dead of night.'

'He called out again to the closest neighbours 'Raphael, Barbara, help me - I'm bleeding to death.'

Police arrived and arrested Mrs Stokes while paramedics attended and took her husband to hospital where he spent eight days being treated.

Two of his chest wounds were so deep they had penetrated and punctured both lungs, Mr Kesner said.
