Coronation Street is set to get its first Muslim family ever - and the soap's producer has admitted that increasing the show's diversity is a long-overdue move.

The new characters will be relatives of Kal Nazir, a former soldier played by Jimi Mistry, who joined the ITV hit two months ago.

Although Coronation Street has been on the air for 53 years, it has never before featured a Muslim family, which producer Stuart Blackburn admitted was 'bizarre' given the multi-cultural makeup of Manchester where the soap is set.

'Kal and his son and daughter live with his mum and dad so we’re going to bring them on to the Street,' Mr Blackburn told the Daily Mirror.

'And that'll be the first Muslim family that Corrie's ever had. Bizarre isn't it?'

Nearly one in six residents of Manchester is a Muslim, according to data from the 2011 census, meaning that followers of the faith have been significantly under-represented on Coronation Street.

Show bosses say they have consulted experts over 'all aspects of their lifestyle, culture and religion' in a bid to ensure that the family accurately reflects the experience of Muslims in Manchester.

However, the soap could cause controversy by showing the Nazirs socialising in the Rovers Return pub even though Islam bans its adherents from drinking alcohol.

Kal, who came
 to the Street as a personal trainer in November last year, has 
previously been shown in the pub drinking soft drinks.

He is played by 41-year-old Mr Mistry, who started his career acting in EastEnders before finding fame as a star of 1999 film East Is East.

In 2010 he competed on Strictly Come Dancing, and later became engaged to his dance partner Flavia Cacace.

Mr Mistry is the son of an Indian father and an Irish mother, and was brought up as a Roman Catholic.

The Nazir family will include Kal's mother, father - to be played by ex-Emmerdale actor Marc Anwar - and two children.

'We've established that Kal's two kids, his daughter and son live with his mum and dad,' Mr Blackburn told the Daily Star.

'We've already cast his dad, Sharif, who is retired. He's not rich but he's made enough money he doesn't need to work.'

Casting for the other family members has yet to be finalised, the producer added.

'I have got every confidence in our stories but they haven't been shot. I'm not a psychic, I don't know how it will turn out.'
