They may be unfancied to win the World Cup as 150-1 outsiders but Mexico as good as it gets when it comes to the now ubiquitous 'selfie'.

The Mexicans squad have become the latest side to try their hand at replicating the famous Oscar 'selfie' - by snapping a photo with their President.

Coach Miguel Herrera captured the moment his squad met President Enrique Pena Nieto during a pre-World Cup ceremony at the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City by grabbing a camera and taking a snap.

Snappy: Coach Miguel Herrera smiles for the camera and he will be hoping to be smiling after a successful World Cup

The selfie includes the Mexican 
President, the national coach, Manchester United's Javier Hernandez, the
 rest of the Mexico squad, as well as team coaches and staff.

The original selfie was posted by Ellen DeGeneres at the 2014 Oscars and holds the record for the most retweets in history on Twitter.

Mexico face a tough task to qualify from Group C as they open their campaign on June 13 against Cameroon before taking on home favourites Brazil and darkhorses Croatia.

Mexico host Israel on Wednesday night and they have friendlies against Ecuador, Portugal and Bosnia-Herzegovina before flying to Brazil.

Herrera's 23-man squad includes a blend of experience and youth- with some players having won 2012 Olympic gold and the Junior World Cup - with Hernandez pivotal to their hopes.

Pivotal: Hernandez may have struggled at United this season but he has 35 goals in 58 internationals

The United striker has endured a frustrating season at Old Trafford but he has 35 goals in 58 internationals and is a favourite of Herrera.

Chelsea's Eden Hazard captured a Belgium World Cup squad selfie featuring many Premier League stars to seemingly start a trend.

Manchester United duo Adnan Januzaj and Marouane Fellaini, Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku and former Blues midfielder Kevin De Bruyne all feature in the photo.
