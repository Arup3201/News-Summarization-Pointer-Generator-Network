It is a timelapse video that is simply out of this world.

Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman shared this incredible footage on Vine this week, showing the cargo spacecraft Cygnus being released from the International Space Station (ISS).

The clip shows the Cygnus being released by the ISS robotic arm and beginning to orbit on its own, disappearing into space as the Earth rotates below - all captured at super speed.

'I pushed the "so long" button': Astronaut Reid Wiseman has shared another incredible capture from space, a time-lapse video of the cargo spacecraft Cygnus being released from the International Space Station

Flight Engineer Wiseman, who was assisting fellow astronaut Alexander Gerst in the release, captioned the video: 'SpaceVine timelapse - @astro_alex worked the arm and I pushed the “so long” button on #Cygnus'.

In July Cygnus carried supplies to the astronauts including food, spacewalking gear, life support equipment, photography and video gear, Nasa revealed on their website.

A second video posted by the astronaut shortly afterwards shows the spacecraft's re-entry over the Pacific Ocean. 

Wiseman has gained a huge following on social media thanks to his jaw-dropping images and videos from space, with over 250,000 followers on Twitter and over 23,000 on video-sharing platform Vine.

Gone: The Cygnus disappears into space, but its fiery re-entry was also captured on video by the astronauts

The 38-year-old's most memorable captures include a video of lightning storms over Italy, Typhoon Halong covering the Earth, and incredible pictures of the aurora. 

He also had many baffled in August when he shared a picture of mysterious green lights off the coast of Thailand, with followers down on Earth throwing around theories including bioluminescent algae and nuclear waste. The lights were later revealed to be fishing boats.

Wiseman has been on the ISS since May, and In June became the first ISS crew member to send a Vine from space.

Incredible: Wiseman last month shared jaw-dropping images of the aurora

Sharing images from ISS over social media has been popular with Nasa astronauts for some time however.

Commander Chris Hadfield's posts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr also gained a huge following for his unique perspective over Earth.
