Child killers Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead have been granted a divorce after he agreed to a separation while behind bars for killing their six children.

Philpott, 58, who is serving life in prison for the manslaughter of six of his 17 children in Derby, agreed to a divorce after being asked by his 34-year-old wife.

The pair were jailed at Nottingham Crown Court after their children - Jade, John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Duwayn – died in a deliberate house fire at their home in May 2012.

Mairead's sister Bernadette Duffy today said she was glad her relative had parted from Philpott.

She told the Daily Mirror's Martin Fricker: 'She's divorced Mick  - she could have done it a lot sooner before they killed the kids. They're both evil, both as bad as each other and good riddance to the pair of them.'

The pair are said to have been granted a decree nisi last week after Mairead began divorce proceedings  earlier this year after telling her cellmates she no longer loved him. 

It came after she reportedly started exchanging romantic letters with Paul Mosley, 47, who was also sentenced to 17 years for his part in the horrific crime.

Philpott, a father of 17, is said to have already moved on from his partner of 11 years, and is keen to meet a new lover when he is released from prison. 

A source told The Sun: 'Incredibly, since he has been inside he has been getting letters from quite a few obviously sick women who have told him they would be keen to meet him when he gets out.

'He's been writing back to them and now says as a divorcee he will be able to find himself a more genuine woman than Mairead.

'That's just the kind of depraved nut he is. Mick still thinks he's God's gift to women and he will be able to take his pick when he gets out. He's always lived in a fantasy world.' 

The Philpotts married in 2003 and shared a cramped three-bedroom council house in Derby with his lover Lisa Willis and their children.

Philpott led his wife and accomplice Mosley into a scheme to get a bigger council house by burning down his home and framing  Ms Willis for the crime after she walked out on him.

He also hoped to win back custody of his five children who had recently moved out of the home. 

His intention was to rescue the sleeping children through an upstairs window but the plan went disastrously wrong after too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control.

The blaze claimed the lives of Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five. 

Philpott, who had previously been jailed for stabbing his schoolgirl lover 27 times, wove a web of lies trying to get away with the crime and even plotted to 'get rich quick' off generous donations from the local community meant to pay for the funerals of his children.

The semi-detached home was left ruined by the deliberate fire which was started by Mick Philpott in May 2012

In the days that followed the fire, Philpott began his elaborate ruse to appear blameless and even appeared at a press conference appealing for information. 

During a fortnight of surveillance at the hotel where they were put up by police in May after the fire, the couple were heard whispering about the case, with Philpott recorded telling his wife to ‘stick to your story’.

They were charged by police on May 30 in connection with the deaths and Mosley was arrested in the months afterwards, having told a friend the plan had been for him to rescue the children.

Police initially charged the trio with murder but downgraded this to manslaughter because while their actions were sickeningly reckless, the defendants had not intended to kill the six.

However, he was found guilty of the horrific crime at a trial in April last year and sentenced to life behind bars. 

The judge described the plot as 'a wicked and dangerous plan' that was 'outside the comprehension of any right-thinking person'.

He is currently being held in Wakefield Prison  with a minimum term of 15 years after being branded a 'disturbingly dangerous' man.

His wife, who is currently at Bronzefield women's prison near Ashford, Surrey, is likely to be released after serving half of her 17-year term for manslaughter. 

She hopes to be out of jail by her 40th birthday but lost a second bid to challenge the length of her sentence in November last year.  

There was applause from the public gallery as Court of Appeal judges sitting at Nottingham Crown Court dismissed the renewed application to challenge her jail term.
