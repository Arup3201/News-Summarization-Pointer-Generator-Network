Waves as tall as skyscrapers move deep within the ocean, but despite their vast size, marine scientists are unsure what happens when the waves crash into land. 

Now, 40 researchers aboard ships in the Tasman Sea are trying to unlock the mystery of the 1,000ft (305 metre) waves, by measuring how they travel, how their energy is dissipated and the benefits they may bring.

The waves are thought to be important to the oceans' health and understanding exactly how they 'die' could lead to more accurate climate modelling.

Some 40 researchers   are trying to unlock the mystery of what happens to the energy of 1,000ft (305metre) high waves that travel across seas and crash into land (illustrated), as well as what benefits they may bring

‘Internal waves’ move just like those breaking on a beach, but are larger and slower, as well as being located deep in seas and oceans.

Robert Pinkel, professor of oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, told TakePart.com: ‘The wavelength between crests is about 100 miles, and they’re moving at jogging speed.’

Internal tides form when the surface tides visible on coastlines wash water back and forth across undersea mountains. They can be created at any depth.

The forces created by that movement spawn underwater waves that can travel great distances in the interior of the sea, but no-one is sure what happens to their energy when they hit land.

Some 40 researchers aboard ships in the Tasman Sea are studying the waves (the Revelle is shown). They will deploy autonomous ‘deep-diving gliders’ as well as 15 deep sea moorings, which are anchored cables equipped with dozens of temperature sensors and other devices to provide data on the internal tides

Physical Oceanographer, Harper Simmons, likened the east coast of Tasmania - where the reserach is taking place (shown on the map) to a natural laboratory for the study of deep tidal mixing

What: An international ocean study to track the massive internal waves of the Tasman Sea. The project, called the Tasman Tidal Dissipation Experiment (T-tide) will take 10 weeks.

Where: The ships – the Revelle and Falkor - have departed from Hobart, Tasmania.

Why: Findings about how the waves dissipate will lead to improvements in global climate models and an understanding of how marine nutrients circulate.

Action: Scientists will deploy autonomous ‘deep-diving gliders’ as well as 15 deep sea moorings. 

They will use instruments on the ships to search for turbulent internal waves at depths of up to two miles (3km) that are predicted to collide with the Tasmanian continental slope, and collect data about them.

The waves are responsible for stirring up marine nutrients and carrying them to the surface, providing food for everything from plankton to whales.

Scientists believe that areas of the ocean with active internal waves, such as the Tasman Sea, are among the healthiest locations.

Marine biologists are focusing their research efforts on the sea, which is where the largest internal waves on the planet are formed.

Physical Oceanographer, Harper Simmons of the University of Alaska, likened the east coast of Tasmania to a natural laboratory for the study of deep tidal mixing.

Tasmania stands in the path of a ‘beam’ of internal tidal waves that are generated on an underwater mountain chain - the Macquarie Ridge - south of New Zealand. 

Skyscraper-sized waves formed there, take around one week to travel 1,500 miles (2,414km) to the southeast coast of Tasmania, before breaking on the continental shelf – the 'ramp' of rock before the shore.

Computer models and satellite observations confirm that four waves slam into the east coast of Tasmania daily. But scientists are not sure how the energy of the enormous waves dissipates. 

Internal waves are thought to be important to the ocean’s health and understanding how their energy dissipates could lead to more accurate climate modelling as well as building the clearest picture yet of the vast waves. Waves rebounding on a coastline are pictured

The Scripps Institute says in a post: ‘What happens next isn’t so clear, since the wave-breaking and turbulence that results from this impact will happen far below the often stormy sea surface.’

The researchers  say the knowledge they gain on their trip will boost the accuracy of climate modelling.

In order to study the waves, they will deploy autonomous ‘deep-diving gliders’ as well as 15 deep sea moorings, which are anchored cables equipped with dozens of temperature sensors and other devices to provide data on the internal tides.

Scientists will use instruments on the ships to search for turbulent internal waves at depths of up to two miles (3km) that are predicted to collide with the Tasmanian continental slope - and collect data about them.

Scripps oceanographer Matthew Alford said: ‘The goal of scientists is to discover and measure the procession of those internal tidal waves and to document the various phenomena that occur when they impact the deep continental slopes.’

‘It is conjectured that the turbulent mixing that occurs in the deep sea off Tasmania and other “special” sites is sufficient to affect the overall circulation of the global ocean. Understanding these processes is thus a critical step in predicting our climate.’

Internal waves are responsible for stirring up marine nutrients and carrying them to the surface, providing food for everything from plankton to whales ( a stock image of a humpback feeding is shown)

Commenting on the study, Dr Robert Hall, a physical oceanography lecturer at the University of East Anglia (UEA) told MailOnline: ‘The importance of this research lies in understanding how different waters of the ocean are mixed together.

‘The global circulation of the ocean features cooling of surface water in the North Atlantic and around Antarctica.

‘This cold water sinks to the bottom of the ocean and travels towards the equator. Near the surface, warm water moves towards the poles to replace the water that has sunk - the Gulf Stream is one of these warm surface currents.

‘A question that remains is how the cold water near the bottom is returned to the surface to complete the circulation.

‘Mixing of the deep ocean water is required to do this and breaking of internal waves on continental slopes is one way this mixing can occur. The internal waves are generated either by the tide or by storms over the ocean.

‘The global circulation of the ocean is important as it - along with the circulation of the atmosphere - transports heat from the warm tropics to the cool poles. This is one climate connection.
