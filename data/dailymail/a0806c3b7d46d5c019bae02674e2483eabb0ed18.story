Banking giants must be broken up to drive down the cost of mortgages and loans for customers, a leading think tank said today.

Separating high street banking from high-risk investment arms would increase competition and make it easier for people to get a better deal, the Institute for Public Policy Research.

The Don't Bank On It report warned customers are paying huge fees and charges because a handful of big name banks dominate and impose charges on customers to maximise pay and bonuses.

Call for change: The report by the IPPR argued competition in banking should be increased by making it easier for new players to enter the market

Global banks have become too 
‘detached’, focussing on maximising salaries and bonuses even if it 
meant ripping off customers, the report said.

In future banking bosses could be 
personally fined if things go wrong. Senior management should suffer the
 internal equivalent of bankruptcy’, which would mean they lose their 
jobs and any deferred bonuses and pension rights.

Ministers are also accused of being ‘too timid’ in taking on the City to split retail and investment banking.

It is argued that if the risky 
investment banking was hived off, no bank would be ‘too big to fail’ and
 the taxpayer would not be forced to step in to rescue an institution 
which got into trouble.

Competition in banking should be increased by making it easier for new players to enter the market, the report argued.

‘Given the culture of the financial 
sector is unlikely to change without external influence, retail and 
investment banking activities should be split into separate 
institutions.’

Retail banks would offer a ‘relatively
 simple process’ with policymakers would be to ‘facilitate a high degree
 of  competition’ to get the best deal for customers, both savers and 
those looking for a loan.

‘Investment banking would be far more 
complex in nature and would require much stricter regulation designed to
 control risk-taking and minimise the risk of another financial crisis. 
This could include making senior managers and directors financially 
responsible when things go wrong.’

The IPPR warned that ‘detachment from customers’ was to blame for several banking scandals.

‘Multiple evidence of mis-selling, the
 Libor scandal and the anecdotal evidence that large investment banks 
such as Goldman Sachs exist primarily to maximise the salaries, bonuses 
and share options of their staff rather than to deliver the best 
possible service to their customers  are all signs that the culture of 
finance has changed for the worse.’

Tony Dolphin, chief economist at IPPR,
 said: ‘The Government is making some progress on tackling the implicit 
subsidies the rest of the economy provides for the financial sector and 
on reducing future liabilities for UK taxpayers in the event of a 
financial crisis.

‘It has also taken steps to better 
protect stakeholders, such as depositors, borrowers, investors and 
shareholders. But more action is needed in both areas.’

The report also suggested that 
policymakers might have to look at putting greater curbs on mortgage 
lending to lessen the chances of any return to potentially risky 
lending.

This could involve setting maximum loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios on mortgages, the left-of-centre think-tank said.

The report said the Bank of England 
should be particularly concerned about any institution that records a 
sharp increase in its share of the mortgage market.

Last month, the Parliamentary 
Commission on Banking Standards, set up in the wake of the Libor-rigging
 scandal, said that plans included in the Banking Reform Bill ‘fall well
 short of what is required’.

The commission's report warned the ring-fence to separate risky operations from savers' deposits needed ‘electrification’.
