When President Obama came under fire Tuesday for choosing to skip the ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, a senior White House aide tweeted sarcastically that 'it didn't work schedule-wise' because his boss was too busy working to fix the Obamacare website.

'Serious question,' National Journal editorial director Ron Fournier wrote to White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer on Twitter: 'What is on his schedule that is more important than Gettysburg anniversary?'

'Oh, I don't know,' Pfeiffer snarked in reply, 'there's this whole website thing that someone suggested might destroy the Dem[ocratic] Party.'

In what quickly became a Twitter free-for-all, other journalists pointed out that the president's official schedule for Tuesday didn't mention any meetings related to the Affordable Care Act.

Claws out: White House communications chief Dan Pfeiffer (L) said that Obama skipped the ceremony honoring President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address (R) because he was busy fixing healthcare.gov

The fatally flawed website has made the Obama White House a punching bag for conservatives who say the Obamacare law should be repealed or changed significantly. Its October 1 launch was marked by crashes, downtime, and embarrassing leaks of Americans' personal information.

Obama told a New Orleans crowd on Nov. 8 that 'I wanted to go in and fix it myself, but I don't write code'

Despite his busy schedule, the president found time on Sunday to attend a college basketball game with his daughters. Mrs. Obama's brother is the head coach for one of the teams that played.

Pfeiffer attracted barbs this month for using his Twitter account to criticize a terminal cancer patient who spoke out against Obamacare.

Angry Pennsylvanians directed their ire toward the president on Tuesday, condemning his apparent snub of an invitation to attend the famed 'Four score and seven years ago' commemoration.

'His dismissal of the request shows a man so detached from the duty of history, from the men who served in the White House before him, that it is unspeakable in its audacity,' Salena Zito wrote in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

Preparations: Ceremonies have been held for the entire year leading up to today's anniversary

Zito added that the National Park Service has no record of President Obama ever visiting the historic battlefield, she told Fox News.

Instead of making the trip from the White House to the famed Civil War battlefield, Obama was scheduled to take a meeting with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, and had a speaking engagement at an annual Wall Street Journal conference of CEOs.

The Gettysburg Address has long been considered both one of the most important turning points in the Civil War and one of the greatest speeches in American history.

Despite Obama's decision to skip the 150th anniversary ceremony, he regularly says he feels a particularly strong bond with President Lincoln.

In his honor: Then-Senator Barack Obama chose to announce his 2008 presidential campaign in Springfield, Illinois where President Lincoln gave his famed 'House Divided' speech

Other plans: President Obama, seen with his daughters at a basketball game on Sunday, will be staying in Washington today rather than traveling to Pennsylvania for the ceremony

Obama, then a U.S. Senate freshman from Illinois – the 'Land of Lincoln – launched his 2008 presidential campaign from the state capitol of Springfield where Lincoln gave his 'House Divided' speech.

He also chose to place his hand on the Lincoln Bible while taking the oath of office during both of his inaugurations

The White House has tried to downplay the significance of the president's choice to skip Tuesday's Gettysburg event.

'I think that is an enormously significant event in our history, and I think Americans will take the appropriate time to consider it, consider the speech that was delivered there,' White House press secretary Jay Carney said on October 31.

'But beyond that, I don't have any updates on the President's schedule.'

The Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, attended in Obama's place.

Obama helped to commemorate the historic day by participating in a pre-recorded compilation video that featured all of the living former presidents and a number of celebrities, including Taylor Swift, Bill Gates, Usher, and Uma Thurman, reciting the Gettysburg Address.

Obama attracted a second wave of criticism when it emerged that he omitted the words 'under God' from his reading.

But film producer Ken Burns later added a note to the project's website, saying that the president was asked to read from one of of the speech's few existing hand-written copies that does not include those words.
