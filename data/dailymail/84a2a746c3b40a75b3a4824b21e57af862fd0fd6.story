When Fiona Phillips was invited to a ceremony at her former secondary school, organisers expected the usual speech full of fond reminiscences and messages about the value of hard work.

They got quite the opposite.

The 51-year-old TV presenter bitterly accused Millbrook Community School in Southampton of crushing her aspirations and turning her into a ‘vile teenager’ who was arrested for shoplifting.

Miss Phillips claimed that before leaving with one O-level she expressed a desire to become a doctor but was asked by teachers: ‘Have you thought about hairdressing?’

Rant: Fiona Phillips slammed the education she received at Millbrook School in Southampton when she was invited to be a guest speaker at a ceremony celebrating their rebranding as an Academy

She described then headmaster Fred Lowry as a man who ‘commanded no respect whatsoever’.

And she recalled how she and her classmates locked a teacher in a cupboard and threw another over a bush.

Miss Phillips, the former anchorwoman
with GMTV, was born in Canterbury where her parents ran a pub but moved
to Southampton after primary school.

Blame: The TV presenter said the school turned her into a 'vile' shopping-lifting teenager

She delivered her broadside at a ceremony rebranding Millbrook as the £16million Oasis Academy Lord’s Hill.

‘It was a school rampant with hormones and no discipline, no aspiration and no encouragement,’ she said.

‘I can remember being in classes 
throwing furniture around. We locked a fashion teacher in a cupboard and
threw one over a bush, and that was normal behaviour.

‘My mother was in despair because I 
was so vile to her. They used to come and pick me up from the police 
station after I had been caught for shoplifting. I was in fights after 
school – I won’t even go into what else went on.’

She said her mother could not believe that her conscientious daughter had ‘turned into this vile teenager’.

‘I left with one O-level in English language, purely because I read a lot and all my education came from home.’

Miss Phillips said she had left primary school at the ‘top of her class’ and her arrival at Millbrook had been an ‘eye-opener’.

She went on to say the teaching staff did ‘nothing’ to shore up educational standards.

‘I’m proud to say I went to Millbrook
School. I’m not proud of the education I had there.’ She added that she
was angry the Millbrook area had seen ‘hardly any investment in nearly 
half a century’.

Her harsh remarks upset many of those
connected with the school.

A contemporary of hers said: ‘There was 
nothing wrong with the school nor the pupils who worked hard at their 
education. Perhaps if she had not spent so much time throwing furniture 
and teachers around she may have got more out of her time there. I left 
with seven O-levels. I went to college and worked for my A-levels and 
went to university and worked for my degree.

‘I know from personal experience that
many of my fellow Millbrook pupils did the same – more than the 
national average for the time.’

Retired former headmaster Mr Lowry, 
now 85 and living in Ashurst, Hampshire, declined to comment on Miss 
Phillips’s accusations.

But the Mayor of Southampton, Derek 
Burke, a former governor of Millbrook, accused her of ‘dramatic 
licence’, saying it ‘wasn’t nearly as bad as she painted it’.

Attack: Fiona branded her former head, Fred Lowry, pictured, a man who 'commanded no respect whatsoever'

Of Mr Lowry, he said: ‘I knew Fred. He was a good head teacher of the school. I believe he had respect.’

He added that his own daughters had attended the school and, along with their classmates, achieved success in GCSEs.

Don Thomas, a councillor, said: ‘It’s
not appropriate for her to be criticising a former local-authority 
school which did a good job in difficult circumstances.’

He said he had been contacted by one resident who was very angry at Miss Phillips’s outburst.

‘They were upset at Millbrook being badmouthed. They said it was a good school and they were proud to go to it.’

In the 1970s and 80s, Millbrook was 
one of the largest schools in Southampton with more than 1,200 pupils.

After leaving, Miss Phillips worked for a short time at Mr Kipling’s 
bakery in Eastleigh, but decided to give education another try and 
gained a BA in English at Birmingham Polytechnic.

She began her 
journalistic career at independent local radio stations in Sussex.

Fiona Phillips talked about her 'lack of education' at her secondary school in her biography, Before I Forget, published in 2010...

'I found myself dealing with 12-year-olds who had talked about things I didn’t even know the name of. Girls in the fifth year were pregnant, boys were in borstal, and the school seemed to be a hotbed of carnal curiosity and knowledge,' she wrote.'I was in the top set for everything, but that didn’t mean much in a school that struggled so much with discipline and lack of ambition. We were supposedly the elite of the school, yet our maths classes consisted of being given an exercise book and told which pages to work on, before the teacher left and returned at the end of the lesson to go through the answers, when she hadn’t explained how to tackle the questions in the first place.'There wasn’t much point in trying to learn when most of the pupils were set against it and their parents didn’t care.'
