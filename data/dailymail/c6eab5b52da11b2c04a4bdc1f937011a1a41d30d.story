Mystery surrounds the discovery of a 132-year-old rifle found propped up against a tree in the Nevada wilderness.

The .44-40 calibre Winchester rifle was found frozen in time on a remote rocky outcrop in the heart of the Grand Basin National Park.

Archaeologists discovered the gun, which was manufactured in 1882, leaning against a juniper tree while they were carrying out surveys.

The refile, known as 'The gun that won the West' is one of the most popular selling rifles in US history

Experts do not yet know for certain how long it had been there, but with its wooden base discoloured and partially buried and the metal barrel rusted, it is possible the rifle could have been undisturbed for more than a century.

The Washington Post reports that the Great Basin was a mining site at the time the gun was manufactured, but that farming was also common in the area and the rifle may also have been used for game hunting.

In 1882, 25,000 Winchester rifles of that make were produced costing about $25 each, indicating that they were in plentiful supply. 

The newspaper quotes Basin National Park chief of interpretation Nichole Andler as saying: ‘It looked like someone propped it up there, sat down to have their lunch and got up to walk off without it. 

‘It probably has a very good and interesting story, but it probably is a story that could have happened to almost anyone living this sort of extraordinary existence out here in the Great Basin Desert.’

Experts are scouring local archives in a bid to piece together the history of the weapon, which was found unloaded in November.

A statement on the National Park's Facebook page says: 'The park will provide a viewing opportunity for the community before sending the rifle to conservators to stabilize the wood and apply museum conservation techniques. 

'The treatment will keep the gun looking as it was found and prevent further deterioration.'

Winchester Model 1873 rifles hold a prominent place in America's history, having been the most successful of the gun-maker's products.

They are often referred to as 'the gun that won the west' thanks to its popularity with Western settlers in the 1800s.

According to the Great Basin National Park Facebook page, 720,610 were manufactured between 1873 and 1916 when production finally came to an end. 

In 1882 alone, over 25,000 were made and their accessibility meant prices plummeted from about $50 when they first came out to just $25 in 1882.

They were so widely used that they became known as 'everyman's' rifle and became an important part of life on the frontier.

A lever-action breech mechanism allowed users to unleash a number of shots before having to reload. 

Typical guns weighed about 9.5lbs and were nearly 50ins long with a barrel length of 30ins. 

Winchester went on to produce three variations of the Model 1873: the rifle, carbine, and musket.

Production of the earlier Model 1866 had started in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1867. 

Its prominent role in the nation's history is reflected in its use in a series of Hollywood Westerns including 'Stagecoach' with John Wayne and 'Winchester '73' starring James Stewart.
