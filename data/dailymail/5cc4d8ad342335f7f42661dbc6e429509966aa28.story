Adnan Januzaj is determined to establish himself at the heart of Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United despite being marginalised under the new manager.

Januzaj emerged as a shining light amid the gloom of David Moyes’ time in charge and was rewarded with a five-year contract worth £50,000-a-week exactly a year ago.

But the 19-year-old Belgium forward has yet to start a game under Van Gaal, making all six of his first-team appearances this season off the bench while playing for the club’s Under 21 team.

However, Januzaj will stay and fight for a place at Old Trafford and is ready to compete with Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata for the No 10 role.

‘We want to stay,’ said the teenager’s agent Dirk de Vries. ‘Adnan wants to gain experience in England as No 10 — he doesn’t fear the competition.

‘Just like anyone else he wants to play but he will wait for his opportunity. He is a super professional and he is still motivated, even when he has to play for the Under 21s.

‘We’re not angry. We know the club is very happy with him and they want to keep Adnan for the rest of his career at Old Trafford. They believe in him, otherwise he wouldn’t be handed the No 11 of Ryan Giggs.

‘We have to wait until Van Gaal gives him a chance. But we cannot look into the Dutchman’s head and know what he thinks. I believe Adnan plays well at this moment and I’ve heard that he could start the game on Monday.’

Alex Vervecken, the United scout credited with discovering Januzaj at Anderlecht, believes United’s £150million summer spending spree has left Van Gaal with no choice but to pick the big-name stars.

‘Adnan has still all of his qualities,’ said Vervecken. ‘He will get his chance. Even if he didn’t play for a year, he will stay. Maybe, the problem is that United have started winning games now and Van Gaal focuses on his new guys — Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao. They have to play.

The competition is extremely hard. Even Fellaini doesn’t play and it’s even difficult to make it into the squad. Also, if United were in Europe or the League Cup, Januzaj would have more opportunities.’
