A Texas schoolboy who was born without fingers on his left hand has been given a prosthetic glove made to look like the hand of his favorite superhero Spider-Man.

Brandon Breeckner had just a thumb and four small stubs but now proudly imitates the comic book herowith his very own fully-functioning glove.

The five-year-old, from Dallas, now picks up everyday objects with ease and he gleefully uses his new prosthetic fingers to help him count to 10.

Super hero: Texas schoolboy Brandon Breeckner shows off his his new Spider-Man inspired prosthetic glove; the five-year-old was born with just a thumb and four 'nubbins' on his left hand

Unstoppable: Brandon's mother Shauna said her son's disability had never held him back, saying he was 'a phenomenal little boy and he has not been held back by anything'

Siblings: Brandon and his sister Shelby, two, before e-ENABLE made a prosthetic glove for him

His parents, Shauna, 34, and Jason Breeckner, 33, said their son was thrilled with his new hand as was his little sister, Shelby, two.

Mrs Breeckner said she and her husband were told Brandon was missing some fingers when she was just five months pregnant. The couple immediately began researching prosthetics and websites for children with similar hands to their unborn son. 

As the age of two Brandon had surgery to remove his four little 'nubbins', so he would have a better gripping surface.  

Mrs Breeckner said the disability didn't phase her son. 

She said: 'Brandon is a phenomenal little boy and he has not been held back by anything.'

Mrs Breeckner said her son wanted to be able to 'count to 10 on his fingers, wear gloves with his costumes, and be able to pick things up'

Thanks to his new glove, Brandon can now 'can button, snap, zip, climb and hang like any other child'.

Mrs Breeckner added: 'He wanted to be able to count to 10 on his fingers, wear gloves with his costumes, and be able to pick things up.

'We are still tweaking the hand to make it just right, but Brandon is very pleased with the Spider-Man colors and black spider on the back.'

Brandon was given the glove in October after his family were put in touch with Eric Griffin at e-NABLE - a team of volunteers who use 3D printing to make prosthetic limbs. 

She said Brandon, pictured striking a fighting pose with sister Shelby, 'is very pleased with the Spider-Man colors and black spider on the back'

e-ENABLE designs and builds 3D printers, but Mr Griffin said the company soon realized they could put their equipment to 'use for a good cause'.

He said: 'It quickly became a group undertaking as soon as everyone here began to see how much of a difference we could really make.

'It was one thing to know in an abstract sense that we made tools which give people the power and potential to create.

'But it was a very different thing to directly see the end results of what that creativity could really accomplish, and the dramatic effects it can have on both a child's life, and on their outlook for the future.

'We went from simply making parts to making a difference - it changed our entire outlook on what we can do as makers.'
