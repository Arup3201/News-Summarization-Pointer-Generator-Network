A pre-school teacher who suffered life-changing injuries and needed one leg amputated after the Boston bombings has become the final victim to head home.

Erika Brannock, 29, will return to Maryland after spending 50 days at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center - but bizarrely, she admitted that she was sad to be leaving.

'I'm very excited about getting home, 
but it's kind of bittersweet,' she told the Boston Globe. 'The staff has been amazing. They joke that
I've been a princess because they give me everything I want.'

But she said she is looking forward to returning to the Baltimore area to hug her family and friends and to 'have some steamed crabs'.

Heading home: Erika Brannock, 29, a pre-school teacher from Baltimore who lost a leg in the Boston Marathon bombings has been released from hospital and is now heading back to Maryland

Brannock was hit by the blast as she waited by the finish line with her sister and brother-in-law for their mother to complete the Boston Marathon on April 15.

Brannock herself underwent more than 10 surgeries, including the amputation of her left leg above the knee. She has also lost bone in her right leg and suffered burns and loss of hearing.

She is now wheelchair bound and will move in with her mother, Carol Downing, to her home in Monkton, Maryland while she continues undergoing physical therapy.

She will have to wait before she can be fitted for a prosthesis. She will need to raise at least $85,000 to start the process and her colleagues have started fundraising for the cause.

She is hoping to get back to teaching as soon as she can, however. Before the bombings, she was nearly finished with classes for her master's degree in childhood education at Towson University.

She missed the deadlines but now has six months to complete her coursework. She also plans on returning to the classroom, and intends to work part-time over the summer.

'I can't wait to sit on the floor and read them book,' she told the Boston Globe.

Struggle: She was at the hospital for 50 days and underwent 10 surgeries on her injured legs

Fighter: She lost her left leg above the knee and is missing bone in her right leg. She also suffered burns

To prepare the children for the shock of how different she looks today, she has sent her class a couple of videos. In one she gave them a wheelchair tour of the hospital so they could see her.

'I wanted them to get prepared for it,' she said.

She said she remembers everything about the bomb - from the yellows and oranges of the blast to being comforted by a stranger who introduced herself only as 'Joan from California'.

In an interview alongside her sister
last week, Brannock revealed how she suffered nightmares after one of 
the bombers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was moved to her hospital.

'When I would go in for surgeries, I 
would pass by the ICU where he was,' she told CBS. 'I started having 
nightmares that he was going to get out of his bed... I thought he was 
going to blow the hospital up.'

Despite the pain and anger she has endured, she said she will forever love Boston, and she is sorry to leave the medical staff who have become her friends during her stay at the hospital.

'If I had to leave Baltimore and 
choose another city, this would be it,' she told the Globe. 'It's beautiful, 
the people are wonderful, and to be here after the disaster, with the 
hospitals and people, has been a blessing.'
