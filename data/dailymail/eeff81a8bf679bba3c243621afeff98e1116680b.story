Unless Ferran Soriano is someone who engages in lengthy conversations with himself, it really should not take long to now determine the future of Frank Lampard.

Soriano is the chief executive of both Manchester City and New York City after all, and here again was further evidence of why he simply needs to send an email to his own inbox stating that Lampard is staying put. He can dress it up however he wants. Express a bit of regret even. But he needs to be firm and he needs to be decisive.

Manuel Pellegrini certainly wants the 36-year-old midfielder to stick around, and no wonder when he continues to produce important goals with such frequency.

Lampard is a phenomenon, and not just because that is now six goals in his short time at The Etihad. More staggering is the fact that a midfielder now stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the finest striker we have seen in the Barclays Premier League, Lampard’s 175 goals putting him level with Thierry Henry and fourth only to Alan Shearer, Andy Cole and Wayne Rooney.

Here at the King Power Stadium he proved himself every inch the predator he has long been, timing his arrival perfectly to meet Samir Nasri’s pass with a delightful close-range 40th minute finish.

Tired after their efforts in Rome in midweek and weakened by the loss of Edin Dzeko to injury during the pre-match warm-up, City were struggling to attack a spirited Leicester side with any real conviction. But Nasri showed great skill and composure with a dribble into the box before delivering the ball to perfection to an unmarked Lampard. Nigel Pearson would been annoyed with his defenders. Hell he might even have cursed. But it was an intelligent piece of attacking football from two terrific players.

Heaven knows how they respond over in New York. Presumably with a bit of a groan together with the realisation that they might have to be patient if they ever want to see Lampard marshalling their midfield. About as patient as Leicester supporters might have to be before they see their team win again.

Not since that remarkable 5-3 defeat of Manchester United back in September has it happened, defeat here extending a miserable run to just two points from a possible 33. A run that increases the pressure on a beleaguered Pearson.

They actually played well in spells, starting so impressively – Riyad Mahrez was excellent - the statisticians began to wonder if Leciester might be about to beat the English champions for the first time since 1972; when Keith Weller’s hat-trick conquered Bill Shankly’s Liverpool. 

But such romanticism again gave way to realism, and with yet another reminder of the size of the task facing this club to remain in the top flight.

This was a good day to play City. They might have been strengthened by the return of Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Yaya Toure but Dzeko’s injury in the warm-up forced Pellegrini to employ a relative novice in attack and the loss of Kompany to injury before the end presented further problems. It was certainly a difficult day for 18-year-old Jose Angel Pozo, making his first Premier League start as a replacement for Dzeko.

The setback for City certainly seemed to give Leicester some much needed confidence, because they started brightly here. Jamie Vardy proved a handful for Manchester United when they were beaten here earlier this season and his pace left City’s back four looking stretched at times too. Eliaquim Mangala, impressive here, did particularly well to deny the rapidly advancing Leicester forward with a perfectly executed block.

Leicester can be too cavalier. It probably explains why only QPR had conceded more goals than them in the top flight this season coming into this game. But their early ambition was admirable, with Kompany forced to be at his physical, combative best to deal with Jeffrey Schlupp at one stage. 

David Silva was back fit for Manchester City, though they remain without striker Sergio Aguero who suffered knee ligament damage

Esteban Cambiasso went dangerously close with a free-kick, which was all the more worrying for Pellegrini when his forwards were struggling to impose themselves anything like as effectively. It was Leicester displaying the energy and determination. Leicester who could sense weakness in their opponents.

Fatigue in the wake of their midweek efforts in Rome was clearly a factor, and perhaps explained why two players not involved in that stunning Champions League triumph finally mustered a response for the visitors. 

A neat ball from David Silva was met with a decent shot from Yaya Toure. Sadly for City it was superseded by the save from Ben Hamer, in goal for the injured Kasper Schmeichel.

There was nothing Hamer could do, however, about Lampard’s 40th minute goal; a goal that owed much to the fine attacking play of Samir Nasri but still demanded a calm, clever finish. 

Vincent Kompany down injured in what could be a serious blow to Manchester City

After the break and Leicester remained determined, even if the sight of Pearson barking instructions from his position in the stand to his staff down on the bench suggested he was less than happy. Probably with a lack of composure in that all-important final third.

Pellegrini, meanwhile, began to make changes. Shortly before the hour Lampard walked off to a chorus of ‘super Frankie Lampard’ from the visiting fans – they seem to have adopted the song as well as the player – but the loss of Kompany to what looked like a hamstring problem would have been more worrying for City’s manager.

It provided further inspiration for Leicester, City now without their captain; their defensive rock. At one stage Joe Hart was booked for timewasting, such was the level of concern in trying to hold onto their single goal lead. A lead secured by the evergreen, irrepressible Lampard.
