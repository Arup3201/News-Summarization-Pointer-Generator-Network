Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian premier, has injured his shoulder and his wrist after falling at his villa on the coast of Sardinia.

State television quoted Berlusconi's doctor as saying there was 'nothing worrisome' about the 75-year-old's condition after the fall in the grounds of Villa Certosa, near Porto Rotondo.

Dr Alberto Zangrillo did not elaborate further and it is not clear what caused the former prime minister to take the tumble on Thursday.

A local paper, La Nuova Sardegna, had earlier reported that the tentative diagnosis was a dislocated shoulder and an injured wrist, along with bruises.

It said a member of his Freedom People party, who is a physical therapist for the AC Milan football team, gave Berlusconi first aid.

Berlusconi quit as premier in November amid intense market pressures during Italy's financial crisis. Recently, he has said he is mulling over whether to make a run in next year's election for what would be his fourth term in the premier's office.

Economist Mario Monti is now leading a government of technocrats tasked with saving Italy from financial disaster. Monti has said he will step down in spring, when parliamentary elections are due.

Berlusconi has had a host of other 
medical issues. Some 18 month ago, he had dental and jaw surgery to 
repair a broken nose, and he suffered injuries when a man hurled a 
statuette at him in 2009.

He underwent heart surgery in 2006 to install a pacemaker and has said he successfully battled prostate cancer in the 1990s.
