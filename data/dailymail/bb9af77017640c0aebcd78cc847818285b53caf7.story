The Russian embassy says it hopes a koala hugged by President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Brisbane has survived a mass culling of the marsupials by wildlife officers.

The seemingly light-hearted comment on the embassy's Facebook page refers to the summit in Queensland, but the koala cull was carried out in Victoria.

The message follows news that 686 koalas were put down near Victoria's Great Ocean Road in 2013 and 2014, an operation carried out in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals.

Wildlife officers captured and euthanised the koalas, reportedly by lethal injection, in response to overpopulation and starvation in the area's manna gum woodlands.

The Russian Embassy in Australia posted this status on Facebook yesterday showing their concern after news of the koala cull that happened in 2013 and 2014

The Russian embassy's message reads: 'Hope in the number of euthanised koalas did not get those animals that leaders at the G20 Summit in Brisbane were photographed with.'

The post includes photographs of President Putin and US President Barack Obama holding koalas at the G20 summit in November.

The summit was notable for Western leaders' irritation with Mr Putin over Russia's actions in the Ukraine conflict.

Mr Putin left the summit early following his frosty reception, the koala hugging having provided a rare lighter moment.

Hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials in Victoria due to concerns over starvation

Victoria's Environment Minister Lisa Neville said on Wednesday that the state government had asked experts to advise on the management of koalas at Cape Otway, about 230km southwest of Melbourne.

She wouldn't rule out future koala culls, if recommended by the expert panel but said in the future the culls wouldn’t be kept secret.

'My main priority is making sure that we reduce the suffering of koalas due to starvation,' Ms Neville said.

Cape Otway koalas can't be moved from their native habitat because they overeat and die, she said.

Premier Daniel Andrew said the cull happened some years ago, not under the current government, and there should have been more transparency.

The koalas were reportedly killed via lethal injection after being captured in trees.

Koalas suffering starvation were euthanised, while healthy koalas were released back into the wild and healthy females were treated with control hormone implants.

Animal activists are furious and have condemned the government for their 'cruel' treatment of koalas and questioned why the program was conducted in secret.

Wildlife Victoria chief executive Karen Masson couldn't understand why the cull was kept quiet.

'If they had good, sound expert advice and had adequately explored all other options then they should have been forthcoming with what they were doing and why,' she said in a statement.

Australian Koala Foundation chief Deborah Tabart OAM said she had heard rumours that koalas were being killed but had never had proof until now.

'I want somebody charged,' Ms Tabart said.

'The Australian government over my whole career has said there will never be a cull in Australia ever.

'It's cruel and mean to koalas and pays no respect for the role they play in tourism - how dare they treat this animal with that sort of level of disrespect.

'And if they are so proud of what they were doing why was it done in secret?'

Koala expert Dr Desley Whisson, who advised the government on the euthanasia program, said that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size.

Ms Tabart said more should have been done in previous years to stop the problem from escalating

'Watching an animal starve to death is a horrible thing,' Dr Whisson, from Deakin University, told Daily Mail Australia. 

'For every one koala that was euthanised there were probably two or three that starved without intervention.

'It at least was a good thing to put them out of their misery.' 

Dr Whisson said moving the population to other areas or conducting fertility control programs were expensive options.

'A lot of people ask why we can't just move the koalas somewhere else, but I think it's important to recognise the translocation koalas often has a negative impact,' she said.

'A large number would die, and they don't want to move from manna gum.

'It's sort of a lose-lose situation all round.' 

Dr Whisson said the problem in the manna gum woodland at Cape Otway was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from French Island.

'Manna gum is a very good food source for koalas, it's low in toxins and high in nutrients so koalas love it,' she said.

'To the point where they don't move for the food supply.

'Koalas can move one or two kilometres in a night but in this population, they stay in these manna gum areas and numbers build up.'

Ms Tabart said more should have been done in previous years to prevent the problem from escalating.

The koalas, many of which were starving, were killed via lethal injection after being captured in tree

'Instead of doing this why didn't they plant trees all those years ago?' she said

'They could have taken young ones out and relocated them.

'They've done nothing – they've watched until the problem becomes immense and then gone "Oh we better do something let's kill them."

'It's easy to say we had to put them out of their misery – they shouldn't have got to that misery in first place.'

At Cape Otway there are up to 11 koalas per hectare, but the sustainable density is less than one koala per hectare.

The cull is said to have occurred in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals

Koala expert Dr Desley Whisson, who advised the government on the euthanasia program, stressed that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size

Victorian Environment Minister Lisa Neville said she was putting in place a koala management program to deal with the 'a very challenging and complex issue'.

'It is clear it's an overpopulation issue and it is clear that we have had koalas suffer in that Cape Otway area because of ill health and starvation,' Ms Neville told ABC.

'That's just not good enough and that's a terrible way to treat koalas.

'I'm wanting to make sure that we're taking the best action we can in this terrible situation of overpopulation.

'I don't want to see koalas suffer.'

The koala is listed as 'vulnerable' in New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT and as 'rare' in South Australia but it has no official listing in Victoria.
