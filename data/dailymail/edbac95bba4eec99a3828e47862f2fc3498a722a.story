Goal-line technology was put to use for the first time in the 2014 World Cup when France's Karim Benzema half-volleyed the ball at goal in their Group E opener against Honduras.

The ball hit the post and trickled along the line, before goalkeeper Noel Valladares tried his best to stop it from going in.

The Honduras shot-stopper, though, only fumbled it over as referee Sandro Ricci's watch confirmed the ball crossed the line - although replays looked inconclusive to the naked eye.

Gary Lineker, former England striker

'I'm not totally convinced that looks over the line but we have to trust the technology.'

Thierry Henry, former France striker

'Rules are rules, we don't like them. But that ball is clearly over the line.'

Robbie Savage, former Wales midfielder

'I don't think there's any confusion that it works. When it hits the post, they have to show it because the ball is on the line, and it's no goal - that shows it works perfectly.

'In the second instance, the ball is over the line. It works perfectly well, it's a goal, there's no confusion about it.'

The highly-anticipated system, supplied by German company GoalControl, is flawless and, despite dubious replays, settled the debate in France's favour.

It put the tie to bed, doubling France's advantage, and all but ensured 10-man Honduras' World Cup got off to a losing start.

But for England fans, goal-line technology will always come four years too late to the tournament after Frank Lampard's infamous 'goal' that wasn't given against Germany in 2010.

Honduras coach Luis Suarez had no complaints about the result, but admitted he was confused by the protocol which initially saw both a 'no goal' and a 'goal' verdict delivered by the GoalControl system following France's second.

The first message related to Benzema's initial shot, while the second covered the Valladares fumble.

‘During the 90 minutes they played better than us. I have no excuses,’ Suarez said.

‘They were superior to us. It's hard to keep up with one less player. Being outnumbered, it is not easy.

‘On the second goal, the machine first said that there was no (goal), and after granted one. I do not know what to think .’

More
 than 2,000 tests were performed in the run up to the World Cup, all of 
which were successful, while their managing director Dirk Broichhausen claimed it was 'unhackable'.

That is because it doesn't require a connection to the internet between the cameras and the referee's watch.

Used
 in every stadium, the system is able to tell the referee if a goal has 
been scored within a second to an accuracy of 0.2 inches (0.5 
centimetres), with the word 'GOAL' transmitted to a watch on the 
referee's wrist if the ball has crossed the line.

Thankful: Benzema will be glad the system was introduced, even if it was given as an own goal

The head of World Cup broadcast operations says 'if the policy changes, technically speaking it is possible.'

Francis Tellier, chief executive of Host Broadcast Services, says his team is providing on-screen images in 'just a few seconds' for tight offside rulings.

Viewers see a freeze-frame shot with a pitch-wide line to measure the attacking player's position against defenders.

Tellier says one technician is dedicated to 'only doing that (and is) super well-trained.'

FIFA President Sepp Blatter last week suggested allowing coaches to challenge referee decisions.
