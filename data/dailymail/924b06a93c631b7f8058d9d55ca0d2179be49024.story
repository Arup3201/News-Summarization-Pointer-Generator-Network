England boss Roy Hodgson names his 23 squad for this summer's World Cup finals in Brazil on Monday but how are his group rivals faring?

Italy

Manager

Cesare Prandelli took Italy to the Euro 2012 final with an attack-minded plan. Praised for the sense of pride and honour he has restored to the Azzurri, guiding Italy to third at the Confederations Cup was a further sign they are going in the right direction and last month Prandelli extended his contract until 2016.

Dilemma: Mario Balotelli's unpredictability has forced a change of plan for Italy

Key player

Andrea Pirlo, the Juventus midfielder, with 108 appearances to his name so far, dominated England at Euro 2012, but will bow out of international football after the World Cup. Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti has been anointed his successor.

Injury worries

Giuseppe Rossi, out for four months with a serious knee injury sustained in January, made a goalscoring return to form last week for Fiorentina.

Form

Italy were unbeaten in qualifying when Prandelli was planning to build 
his side around Mario Balotelli, but the striker's unpredictability has 
forced a change of plan. Prandelli is still unsure whether to play one 
or two up front and, with Rossi not certain to start, he may opt for a 
front three in which Alessio Cerci and Antonio Candreva can track back 
to boost the numbers in midfield.

Boost: Giuseppe Rossi made a goalscoring return to form for Fiorentina

Team

Current starting XI (4-3-3): Buffon; Romulo, Barzagli, Chiellini, De Sciglio; Rossi, Pirlo, Montolivo; Cerci, Balotelli, Candreva.

Uruguay

Manager

Oscar Washington Tabarez is eight years into his second spell as Uruguay manager, but he has had to deal with criticism as results since finishing third in 2010 and winning the 2011 Copa America have dropped off. He has kept faith with the same group of players as in 2010 despite calls for more new faces.

Hype: Uruguay have tried to play down expectation surrounding Luis Suarez

Key player

Luis Suarez. Tabarez has spoken of his fear that Suarez gets injured right at the end of the Premier League season, but he has tried to play down expectations on the team's star man as the increase in pressure could leave Suarez frustrated in Brazil.

Injury worries

Liverpool's Sebastian Coates has just returned after eight months out with a knee ligament injury and could yet get into the squad. Fernando Muslera, Diego Perez, Arevalo Rios and Nicolas Lodeiro all have knocks but should recover.

Concern: Uruguay captain Diego Lugano has only played four games for West Brom this year

Form

Diego Lugano, the team's leader and captain, has played only four league matches for West Bromwich Albion in 2014 and his lack of game time will be a problem as he is considered undroppable. Gaston Ramirez, currently out of the Southampton side, is fully fit and should come in for Diego Forlan.

Team

Current starting XI (4-3-1-2): Muslera; Maxi Pereira, Lugano, Godin, Caceres; Arevalo Rios, Diego Perez, Alvaro Gonzalez; Ramirez; Suarez, Cavani.

Costa Rica

Manager

Jorge Luis Pinto. This is third time lucky for Colombian boss Pinto, who failed to qualify in 2006 (with Costa Rica) and in 2010 (as Colombia coach). Has added defensive rigour to what used to be a free-wheeling team, with Costa Rica's three-man defence coming into its own away from home.

Danger man: Arsenal striker Joel Campbell had a successful campaign on loan at Olympiacos

Key player

Joel Campbell. The Arsenal striker had a successful campaign on loan at Olympiacos and gives Costa Rica an unpredictable element up front. 'He's a great talent who can make the difference in any game,' said former forward Paulo Wanchope.

Injury worries

There was a blow on Saturday night when Everton’s Bryan Oviedo revealed that he would notrecover in time from the leg he broke in January. Mainz’s Junior Diaz should replace him. Rosenborg defender Cristian Gamboa is set to recover from his knee injury.

Form

Pinto is convinced that Costa Rica can pull off a shock in Brazil, although squad depth is an issue.

Team

Current starting XI (5-3-2) Navas; Gamboa, Umana, Gonzalez, Acosta, Oviedo; Tejeda, Borges, Bolanos; Ruiz, Campbell.
