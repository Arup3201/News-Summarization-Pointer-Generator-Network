The sun has unleashed a massive solar flare seven times the
size of Earth from one of the largest sunspots seen on the star’s surface.

The stunning flare, the first major one of the year, peaked
at 6:32pm GMT yesterday and follows on the heels of a mid-level flare earlier
in the day.

Each flare came from a different area of a large sunspot
group which Nasa believes is the biggest seen on the sun in nearly a decade.

Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Their energy
travels at the speed of light to reach Earth in just eight minutes.

At Earth, a part of the atmosphere called the ionosphere absorbs it.

Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's
atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground.

However, when intense enough, flares can disturb the
atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.

This picture combines two images from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured yesterday. Together, the images show the location of a giant sunspot group on the sun, and the position of an X-class flare that erupted

Solar flares can temporarily alter the upper atmosphere creating disruptions with signal transmission from, for example, a GPS satellite to Earth.

Another phenomenon produced by the sun could be even more disruptive. Known as a coronal mass ejection or CME these solar explosions propel bursts of particles into Earth's atmosphere.

Those fluctuations could induce electric fluctuations at ground level that could blow out transformers in power grids. A CME's particles can also collide with crucial electronics onboard a satellite and disrupt its systems.

This disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is on-going,
anywhere from minutes to hours.

The latest flare already delayed the launch of a private cargo ship
to the International Space Station which was due to lift off today.

Commercial spaceflight company Orbital Sciences was hoping
to launch a significant cargo delivery flight to the space station with
its Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft.

The decision was made as the Antares rocket was awaiting launch at its pad at Nasa’s Wallops Flight Facility.

‘Early this morning the Antares launch team decided to scrub
today's launch attempt due to an unusually high level of space radiation that
exceeded by a considerable margin the constraints imposed on the mission to
ensure the rocket's electronic systems are not impacted by a harsh radiation
environment,’ Orbital Sciences said in a statement today.

The latest flare is classified as an X1.2-class flare.
X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more
information about its strength.

It is not thought to pose a threat to the six astronauts and
cosmonauts living on board the International Space Station, Nasa has confirmed.

Forecasters, however, are anticipating strong geomagnetic storm conditions to occur on January 9 and 10. 

This labeled image taken by SDO's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager shows the location of two active regions on the sun, labeled AR1944 and AR1943, which straddle a giant sunspot complex. A January 7, 2014, X1.2-class flare emanated from an area closer to AR1943

The forecast is for a 'fairly direct' 
interaction with Earth, anticipated to arrive in around midday in the 
UK. The storm may disrupt some GPS satellites in its path.

‘The solar flux activity that occurred late yesterday
afternoon resulted in an increasing level of radiation beyond what the Antares
engineering team monitored earlier in the day,’ Nasa officials added.

The sun is currently in an active phase of its 11-year solar
weather cycle. The current cycle, known as Solar Cycle 24, began in 2008.

In November, the sun fired off a similarly huge solar flare causing
a wide-area blackout of high frequency signal.
