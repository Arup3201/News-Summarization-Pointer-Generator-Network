Victorious European captain Paul McGinley reflected on the beauty of the Ryder Cup trophy before looking forward to defending the title won at Gleneagles in Minnesota in two years time.

McGinley offered his thanks to all involved in the successful European campaign and spoke of 'a sporting spectacle in the country that gave birth to golf'. 

Scotland's first minister Alex Salmond - greeted by boos from the crowd - presented the trophy to the winning captain after Europe finished off the USA 16½-11½ on Sunday.

'What a sporting spectacle we have witnessed in the country that gave birth to golf,' McGinley said.

'As we stand next to this beautiful trophy, we the European team feel very honoured and humble to be able to raise it together very shortly.

'For me personally, as European captain, I will now be forever linked in the game's history books to my golfing hero Tom Watson.

'We, the European team, now look forward to the next edition of the Ryder Cup in two years' time at Hazeltine National, Minnesota, we look forward to the challenge of defending the trophy on American soil.
