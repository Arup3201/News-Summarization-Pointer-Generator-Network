Simon Mignolet returned to the Liverpool team on Boxing Day as he came on to replace the injured Brad Jones.

The Belgian goalkeeper was thrown into the action in the 16th minute after Jones was unable to continue with an apparent thigh injury.

Mignolet was dropped by Brendan Rodgers after Liverpool were dumped out of the Champions League by Basle on December 9 following his poor run of form.

Jones stepped into the side and started the last three matches against Manchester United, Bournemouth and Arsenal as well as Boxing Day at Burnley.

Before their trip to Burnley, Liverpool boss Rodgers insisted that he hasn't lost faith in Mignolet.

'In terms of Brad, he has come into the team. When called upon during my time here, he has done very well,' said Rodgers.

'He is a very loyal goalkeeper. When he is asked to come in he does very well. Simon's response has been fantastic. His training has been really good. That time coming out of the team can do you good. We have been looking at the areas that he can improve.

'Sometimes that little period out can help. Brad is in the team at the moment. The one thing that impresses me is he is consistent all the way through. You need your No 2 to be loyal. He comes in and does his work religiously.Â 

'He is a wonderful professional so when he comes in he does his work really well. Simon has been very impressive in how he has responded. I haven't lost any belief in him. He is still a top goalkeeper.'
