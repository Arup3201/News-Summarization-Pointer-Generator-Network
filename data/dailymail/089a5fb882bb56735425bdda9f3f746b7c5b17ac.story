The police are giving the public tips on how to spot a potential terrorist in a drive to encourage people to report suspicious behaviour.

Leaflets given to commuters by officers this morning include six things which should set alarm bells ringing, including someone with a lot of mobile phones, vague travel plans or taking a keen interest in CCTV cameras.

It comes after ministers urged the public to be ‘vigilant’ and warned Britain is at 'very significant risk' from a terror attack by extremists inspired by ISIS jihadists in the wake of the atrocities in Paris.

Commuters arriving at Waterloo station this morning were handed the flyers promoting the confidential anti-terrorist hotline, which advise the public: ‘Don’t rely on others. If you suspect it, report it.’

It makes clear that specialist counter-terror officers should decide whether something suspicious is important and could help to prevent an attack.

The leaflet adds: ‘Everyone has a role to play in helping to prevent terrorism. You can do this by remaining vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity to the police.’

It sets out six types of suspicious activity to report to police, including:

The Metropolitan Police said the leaflets being handed out today were part of ongoing measures to educate the public and not a change in approach.

Britain's threat level was raised from 'substantial' to 'severe' in August last year following the gains made by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. 

It means an attack is 'highly likely', one level below 'critical' which means an attack is considered imminent.

In the hours after the terror attack on the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, extra armed police were deployed across London, including in Westminster and at St Pancras train station.

Police and security agencies have warned it is ‘almost inevitable’ that an attack will be launched in the UK by fanatics radicalised by ISIS.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned last week that ISIS, also known as Isil and Islamic State, poses ‘probably the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security’.

Speaking at a counter-terror conference in London, he said: ‘There's a very significant risk of an Isil-inspired attack being planned and, if we are not successful in intercepting it, executed by Isil sympathisers who live in the UK but are inspired by what is going on in Iraq and Syria.

'Of course, our security and intelligence agencies, our police forces are working tirelessly around the clock to monitor, to identify, to intercept and to disrupt plots of this nature, and we've been very successful in doing so, but we mustn't be complacent.

'We know there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack.'

In the wake of the terror attacks in Paris earlier this month, armed police were deployed to sites across London including St Pancras station

The leaflets distributed today strike a more low key note than a campaign launched in November last year telling commuters what to do in the event of a Mumbai-style terrorist attack at one of Britain's busy terminals.

After government warnings that the threat to Britain from Islamist fanatics is 'greater than ever', officers handed out leaflets telling the public to 'run, hide and tell' if they are caught up in an attack.

The flyer, which has been attacked as 'scaremongering' by critics, shows images of worried-looking people running down flights of stairs, cowering in the dark and anxiously talking on their mobile phones.
