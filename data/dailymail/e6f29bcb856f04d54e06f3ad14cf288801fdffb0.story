British archaeologists have made a breakthrough discovery in dating the the birth of Buddhism.

A group of 15 archaeologists led by Professor Robin Coningham of Durham University, have excavated an ancient shrine dating back to the sixth century BC which lay within the Maya Devi Temple in Lumbini, Nepal.

The Unesco heritage site has long been identified as the birthplace of Buddhism, but the discovery of the shrine, believed to be the place where Siddhartha Gautama, the man who became Buddha, was born been hailed as the first archaeological material pinpointing the life of the deity.

The British team worked alongside monks, nuns and pilgrims at the sacred site in collaboration with conservationists and planners.

They wore only slippers or went barefoot during the excavation work, as shoes are forbidden in the sacred temple, over three winters in Nepal, when the water table is at its lowest.

Buddhist tradition records that Queen Maya Devi, the mother of the Buddha, gave birth to him while holding on to the branch of a tree within the Lumbini garden, midway between the kingdoms of her husband and parents.

Prof Coningham and his colleagues have speculated that the open space in the centre of the shrine they discovered may have accommodated a tree.

The discovery of a shrine inside the temple means scientists can, for the first time, place the birth of Buddhism in the 6th century BC

He said the birth of Buddha had been placed in a wide spectrum from the early 400s BC to the 7th or 8th Century BC by different traditions within Buddhism.

The discovery made it likely that the Buddha lived in the 6th Century BC, he said.

'It is one of the most exciting discoveries in terms of Buddhist archaeology since the early discoveries of the sites because we now have an idea of what the earliest Buddhist shrine looked like', he said.

'The significance for us is that the shrine is built around a tree and the fact that the Buddhist birth story is connected with a tree.

Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, was a real person, born in what is now Nepal.

His father, Suddhodana, was a king and and Siddhartha grew up living the luxury life of a young prince.

Siddhartha's father feared that his son would be upset by the suffering and pain of normal people ordered that he live a life of total seclusion.

But one day Siddhartha ventured out into the world and was confronted with the reality of the inevitable suffering of life.

The next day, at the age of twenty-nine, he left his kingdom and newborn son to lead the life of a monk.

For six years, Siddhartha commited himself to rigorous ascetic practices, studying and following different methods of meditation with various religious teachers.

One day he was offered a bowl of rice from a young girl and he accepted it. In that moment, he realised that physical austerities were not the means to achieve liberation.

From then on, he encouraged people to follow a path of balance rather than extremism. He called this The Middle Way.

That night Siddhartha sat under the a Fig tree called the Bodhi tree, and meditated until dawn.

He purified his mind of all defilements and attained enlightenment at the age of thirty-five, thus earning the title Buddha, or 'Enlightened One'.

For the remainder of his eighty years, the Buddha preached the Dharma in an effort to help other sentient beings reach enlightenment.

'It is one of those really rare occasions when belief, tradition, archaeology and excavation actually come together.'

Buddhism is based largely on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, commonly known as the Buddha and is one of the world's oldest religions.

Many hundreds of thousands of Buddhists from around the world make the pilgrimage to Lumbini every year.

The excavation work was funded by the Japanese government in partnership with the Government of Nepal as part of a Unesco project aimed at strengthening conservation and management of the temple.
