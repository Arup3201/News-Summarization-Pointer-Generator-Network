Residents fled in terror yesterday from a block of flats that was set on fire by a bolt of lightning as storms caused chaos across Britain.

The building in Bermondsey, south-east London, was struck at around 2pm – the same time as a control tower at Gatwick Airport was hit, forcing flights to be suspended.

Meanwhile, a teaching assistant escaped unhurt after he was knocked to the ground by a lightning strike at his primary school today.

And tennis fans at Wimbledon were 
swamped by heavy rain – as were spectators watching the England vs Sri 
Lanka cricket match at the Oval.

In Hertfordshire, a two-storey terraced home in London Colney was devastated by a lightning strike. It set the roof and two neighbouring ones ablaze and filled the upper floor with ash and rubble. It took 11 fire engines to stifle the flames.

Strikes also set houses on fire in Sussex, Suffolk and Kent with one witness describing a house in Felixstowe as erupting ‘like a bomb going off’.

Lightning also hit railway signals, 
causing serious delays to train services around the South East. It came 
after 33c heat yesterday also caused problems on the tracks.

Around
a quarter of the average monthly total of rain fell in the region 
yesterday afternoon as flood alerts remained in place in parts of the 
Thames valley.

A spokeswoman for the Met Office said 9mm fell in Cavendish, Suffolk, between 3pm and 4pm

In Bermondsey, ambulance and fire crews raced to the tower block after a blaze broke out on the 17th floor. Some 40 residents fled as smoke billowed out of the 21-storey building.

One woman was treated at the scene for minor smoke inhalation by ambulance staff but there were no other casualties reported.

London
Fire Brigade said it was investigating the cause of blaze, which broke 
out at Lupin Point on Abbey Street in Bermondsey this afternoon.

Eight fire engines were deployed when the brigade was called just before 2pm and the fire was brought under control by 3.44pm.

Station
manager Richard Welch said: ‘Our crews did really well to quickly gain 
entry into the flat where the fire started and stop the fire from 
spreading further than it did.’

A
London Ambulance spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that we were called at
2.02pm today to reports of a fire on Abbey Street, SE1.

‘We sent a duty manager, an ambulance crew and two hazardous area response team units.

‘At present our staff are treating a woman on the scene for minor smoke inhalation.’

Tom Langham, who works at Hackbridge Primary School in Sutton, south London, was hit by a bolt at around 1.45pm.

The 25-year-old was not injured, but was taken by a London Ambulance 
Service crew to St Helier Hospital in Sutton for a check-up.

Jacquie Fairhurst, head teacher at Hackbridge Primary School, said: 'The
bolt knocked him to the ground but he didn't lose consciousness and was
able to make his way back inside.

'Afterwards he said he was fine but felt like he had been in a round with Mike Tyson.'

Lightning also knocked out computers and a burglar alarm at the school.

Mr Langham is expected to be home by tonight and back at work on Thursday.

After an air traffic control tower was struck by lightning at Gatwick West Sussex, departing flights were suspended for half an hour.

The incident, at around 2pm, led to the temporary failure of some ground-based systems,  although no one was hurt and there was no structural damage.

An airport spokeswoman said: 'Planes are able to leave but on a restricted basis. We are advising passengers that there may be some delays.'

And as high temperatures gave way to storms this afternoon, train services were hit by lightning strikes affecting signals.

The weather phenomenon meant delays of up to 90 minutes on services in the Welwyn Garden City and Hertford North areas of Hertfordshire.

Passengers affected were on trains run by the East Coast, First Capital Connect, First Hull Trains and Grand Central companies.

There were also delays of up to 90 minutes on services to the west of London after a lightning strike affected signalling in Southall.

Passengers travelling on Heathrow Express trains to the airport were among those whose journeys were disrupted.

Another lightning strike was at signalling at Petersfield in Hampshire.

This led to 45-minute delays to South West Trains' services between Guildford in Surrey and Portsmouth Harbour.

An Environment Agency spokesman said: ‘Staff are on 24-hour alert and teams are monitoring river levels as the band of rain moves across the country.’

However, the rain is expected to ease off today, with a drier outlook for tomorrow and Friday.

The storms followed a heatwave that had culminated in Britain’s hottest day of the year on Monday, when temperatures in Gravesend, Kent, reached 32.8C (91F).
