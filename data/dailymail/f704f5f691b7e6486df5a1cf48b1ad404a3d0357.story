Australians have been warned of an increase in bushfires as a super hot summer is once again predicated across the country.

Temperatures are reportedly going to soar above average over summer 2014-15, for the third year in a row and after 2013 marked the hottest year on record.

The news comes as Sydney scored its hottest two consecutive days on record on Monday and Tuesday, with temperatures reaching up to 35.5 degrees. 

Dr David Jones from the Bureau of Meteorology told Daily Mail Australia: 'The next three months are likely to be above average... and the above average temperatures will continue through both day and night.'

Dr Jones said the biggest changes will be felt in southern and eastern Australia and all the major capital cities and that the rise in temperatures is a continuation of what we have seen for the past three years.

Record temperatures were not just felt in Sydney this week. 'Tasmania just had it's second hottest September on record and WA had its hottest day on record... it's not just Sydney that has seen unusual conditions,' Dr Jones said. 

The rising temperatures this summer are reportedly due to warmer than normal ocean temperatures off the western and southern coastline combined with a developing El Nino - a band of warm ocean water temperatures - in the Pacific Ocean.

However, five separate studies this week blamed 2013's heatwave on man-made climate change caused by carbon emissions.

Researchers from the University of Melbourne, the Australian National University and the University of NSW published their strong statement on the impact of climate change on Australia's weather patterns in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

Dr Jones supports the recent findings and said 'that [climate change] signal in the background is not going away. In the last decade Australia has only seen one relatively cool year.' 

Heatwaves are set to occur in Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth this severe weather season, according to the Sky report.

Meanwhile, Australia is predicted to experience an increasing number of bad bushfire weather days in its southern and eastern states.

It will be the third year in a row Australia has experienced record temperatures

The high temperatures this week were just a taste of what is to come over summer

Dr Richard Thornton, CEO of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, told Daily Mail Australia: 'An underlying lack of rainfall across much of central and eastern Australia and in the south-west of the continent has increased the potential for bushfires in these areas over the coming season. 

'Despite good rainfalls in recent weeks in some areas and large fires last season, many areas are still dry and largely unburnt. If this summer is again very hot and dry the conditions are set for a potentially bad bushfire season.' 

RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Sydney Morning Herald this season would be worse than the last.

'Without being alarmists in anyway, we are being realistic based on the forecast and the underlying conditions, [that this] season is shaping up to be a difficult one,' he said.

The official bushfire seasons began on Wednesday and a bushfire map, published this week by the Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC, shows the areas that have the potential for a fire to be more severe if it were to occur.

The map, which is used as a tool to help fire agencies prepare for bushfires, shows how fires could break out in many parts of the country.

Bushfire potential depends on many factors including weather and climate, fuel abundance and availability, recent fire history and firefighting resources available in an area.

The Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC's September reports says that rainfall since May has been below average across most of Queensland, northern and eastern New South Wales, northern South Australia and much of south west Western Australia.

This combination of little rain, above average temperatures and near El Nino conditions in the Pacific means above normal fire seasons are expected in many areas.

Last year the worst bushfires since the 1960s tore through NSW and devastated the Blue Mountains area in October.

At the peak of the fires, on the morning of 18 October, over 100 fires were burning across NSW.

The Premier of New South Wales Barry O'Farrell declared a state of emergency on 20 October, which saw firefighters evict residents and demolish fire-affected buildings.

As of 19 October 2013, two people were killed while 248 houses and other structures were destroyed across the state because of the fires. 

Dr Thornton explained that this year large areas of southern Australia, especially along the east and west coasts extending inland, South Australia’s west coast and central Western Australia, face above normal fire potential for the 2014-2015 fire season.

He said the key learnings from last year's devastating Blue Mountains bushfires show that most Australians do not have a written bushfire plan.

CRC research conducted in partnership with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service after the 2013 October bushfires in the Blue Mountains, Southern Highlands and Port Stephens areas showed that of the 194 people interviewed, 73 per cent indicated they had some form of bushfire plan before the fire, however only seven percent indicated having a written bushfire plan. 

'The research also reveals that people delayed their decision to stay or leave until the bushfire actually threatened and they could see signs such as smoke. Significantly, very few people proactively left early on the basis of extreme weather forecasts,' Dr Thornton said.

He advised that people who live in a bushfire-prone area, including on the edge of a city or town, should make a bushfire survival plan.

'Write it down, talk about it with your family and practice your plan. It’s also important to have a back up plan, as we know from research after Black Saturday that things can go wrong. What will you do if the pump fails, or the hoses melt? It’s important to know what your triggers for different actions are,' he said.
