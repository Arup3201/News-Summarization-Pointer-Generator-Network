He's the most famous British spy ever, whose iconic role can define an actor's entire career.

And while the likes of Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore will forever be remembered for playing James Bond, there will always be those who narrowly missed the cut as 007.

But a newly-revealed photo archive has given a fascinating insight into the men who just failed to land the part as the smooth-talking Secret Agent.

The final five: Hans De Vries, Anthony Rogers (top row, left and right),
 along with John Richardson and Robert Campbell (bottom row, left and 
centre), all failed to land the James Bond role ahead of one-time 007 
George Lazenby (bottom right)

Pictures from 1967 show five actors in a casting session for the Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, where the lead role eventually went to George Lazenby.

The Australian actor, succeeding Sean Connery who had just given up the role, landed the lead part in what would be his only Bond appearance.

The history of the iconic spy franchise could have been very different, however, if one of the four other aspiring Bonds had landed the coveted main role.

Ladies man: John Richardson, a British actor then in his mid-30s, in a casting session for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which was released in 1969

Licence to thrill: Anthony Rogers, who had previously appeared in Doctor Who and El Dorado, also tried out for the iconic spy role

Shaken not stirred: Robert Campbell, who faded into complete obscurity after his failed audition, tries his best to channel Bond in this casting session picture

The photos taken for LIFE magazine in 
1967 show aspiring Bonds suiting up, brandishing weapons, sipping 007's 
trademark martini and charming beautiful women in his own inimitable 
style.

Among them is British
 actor John Richardson, who is pictured facing a gun from his female 
co-star in a typically 'Bond' scenario.

Other fascinating images show another hopeful, Anthony Rogers, alongside a love interest as he did his best to land the part of the suave spy.

The third nearly-man is Robert Campbell, who competed for the role by screen testing in a trademark Bond kissing scene with a female co-star.

Lastly is Hans de Vries, who, just like the others who failed to land the part, faded into relative acting obscurity following his rejection.

Richardson, a British actor then in his mid-30s who had considerable film experience, was considered to be Lazenby's main rival for the role, but narrowly missed out.

The actor, now 78, appears to have taken the rejection in his stride, as he went on to appear in dozens of film in an acting career which spanned until 1994.

The same cannot be said for Rogers and Campbell, however. The former had a recurring role in Doctor Who and later El Dorado in 1966, but his acting career stalled after his failed Bond audition.

Campbell meanwhile, appears even more 
of an enigma, as virtually no information appears to exist about his 
acting credentials at all, other than his relation to brother William 
Campbell, the prolific TV actor.

De
 Vries in theory should have stood a decent chance of landing the big 
role, having already appeared in a Bond film as an uncredited control 
room technician in You Only Live Twice.

He
 was also overlooked in favour of Lazenby, who said after landing the 
role: 'I'm really looking forward to being Bond, for the bread and the 
birds.'

Lazenby is said to have been cast as 
Bond for On Her Majesty's Secret Service after impressing directors in a
 screen test fight scene.

The
 Australian also saw off the competition after appearing at an audition 
in a Saville Row suit which had been ordered, but not collected, by his 
predecessor Sean Connery.

The archive also catalogues the attempts of several female actors in trying to land parts opposite the famously womanising Bond.

The
 Swedish actor and model was one of five finalists for a role in the 
1969 film, along with other potential Bond girl Marie Boyer, who is also
 pictured in the LIFE magazine collection.
