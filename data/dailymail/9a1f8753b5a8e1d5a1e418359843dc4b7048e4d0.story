The road to jihad in Syria for six young Australians at the hands of Kings Cross bouncer turned Islamic State facilitator Mohammed Baryalei was one of five star hotels, phone fails and police arrests before crossing the border to join an army of '15,000 holy warriors', court documents show.

Telephone intercepts of conversations between the Australians aged in their twenties and thirties allegedly recruited by Sydney man, Hamdi Alqudsi, to fight in Syria show that although the men stayed in a five-star hotel, they were also at the mercy of mix-ups and poor connections.

The alleged telephone conversations have been tendered in a statement of facts by the Australian Federal Police in a case against Alqudsi, 39, a Sydney disability pensioner who was ordered to stand trial on Friday on charges of having allegedly recruited seven young Australians to go and fight in Syria.

In the transcripts of the phone calls it is claimed that Mohammed Baraylei, the former Sydney man who rose to purportedly become a chief lieutenant of ISIS and may have died in Syria, was unreliable as the contact man on the ground.

The alleged telephone calls show that in July last year, when one of the recruits Mahmoud Aboshi reached Syria, he called Alqudsi to confirm he had crossed the border.

Mahmoud Aboshi allegedly said, 'when we were across, it was beautiful'.

Mr Alqudsi who was charged last December on seven counts of recruiting the men to enter 'into a foreign state, namely Syria, with intent to engage in hostile activity in Syria, in particular, engaging in armed hostilities in Syria'.

Three young Australians connected with Mr Alqudsi,  have been sent to their death in Syria, including former Gold Coast private schoolgirl, Amira Karroum. 

Line up and shot: Beautiful Gold Coast private schoolgirl, Amira Karroum (pictured) secretly flew to Syria last December after her husband, Tyler Casey, was allegedly recruited by Hamdi Alqudsi. Ms Karroum and Casey were shot dead in mid-January in the northern Syrian town of Aleppo

In the police facts it is claimed the men Alqudsi allegedly recruited are Ms Karroum's husband, Tyler Casey, who also has died, and former Australian infantry soldier Canal Temel, 22, from the Sydney suburb of Auburn, who was shot in the head during a siege in January.

Mr Alqusdi's next alleged recruit was Turkish-Australian Mehmet Biber , 21, onetime poet and soccer nut of the western Sydney suburb of Merrylands, believed to still be fighting in Syria.

Another would-be soldier for the ISIS forces in Syria, Amin Mohamed, 23, from Lidcombe in Sydney's inner west, who was arrested while trying to board a plane in Brisbane last December.

The police claim three other alleged recruits - Mahmoud Aboshi, aka Abu Alem, of Melbourne, Muhammed Abdul-Karim Musleh, aka Abu Hassa, and Nassim Elbahsa - are fighting in Syria.

The  transcripts have conversations allegedly between Alqudsi and the men.

He was arrested while trying to board a plane in Brisbane last December and charged with preparing to engage in foreign hostile activities

The police brief of facts claims the recruits had difficulties getting into Syria, with Baryalei not turning up to collect them and the young men being handed over to police.

Mohammed Musleh tells Alqudsi in a phone call on the evening of July 3, that he has met up with ‘a brother’ known as Abu Yahya who belonged to the Ahrar Al-Sham Battalion, who are a coalition of Islamists fighting in the Syrian civil war. 

At 11.27pm on the same evening, Caner Temel speaks with Alqudsi and tells him he, Biber, Musleh and Tyler Casey are having difficulties contacting Baryalei.

Transcripts in the police brief show that just after midnight on July 4, Biber calls Alqudsi and asks if his wife can support Biber’s wife back in Australia, explaining he is having problems with his family who want to come and visit him.

Tyler Casey also calls Alqudsi and makes the same complaint, wondering if they are dialling the wrong international country codes. It appears the young men are staying in a five star hotel, the Ottoman Palace Antakya. 

Moahhamed Ali Baryalei (pictured in Sydney) was unreliable on the ground in Syria and would not always turn up to meet young Australian recruits allegedly sent over by Hamdi Alqudsi

Alqudsi says, ‘They want to come to Syria?’, to which Biber says his parents ‘want to visit Istanbul as they don’t know the truth’.

Minutes later, at 12.47am, Biber’s wife sends Alqudsi a series of text messages saying her parents in law have reported Biber to the police and are ‘trying to find the person responsible’ for his journey to Syria.

On July 21 last year, the police transcript says Alqudsi receives a phone call from another of his alleged recruits, Mahmoud Aboshi, who has landed in Turkey and is waiting to meet up with Baryalei and another go-between called Abu Hashem.

In the transcript it appears Abu Hashem can hardly speak English, but Aboshi manages to enter Syria on the morning on July 23.

The transcript in the police brief includes a number of alleged phone calls, including one at 5.47am between Alqudsi and Aboshi, in which he confirms he has just crossed the border.

Alqudsi says to Aboshi, ‘Don’t forget my jihad over here is yours over there, so what’s happening now you are inside Syria, yeah’.

Aboshi replies, ‘When we were crossing the border there were gunshots on top of us, it was beautiful.’

On September 5, Alqudsi allegedly talks with the sixth alleged recruit, Amin Iman Mohamed (aka Abu Bilal).

Alqudsi tells Mohamed he has received ‘ a message from the boys and Baryalei’ and there was ‘a big job coming up’. 

He said he had spoken to the commander at the headquarters where the boys were saying, who had told him, ‘They have a big, big surgery, big, big operation coming up involving one thousand and five hundred brothers … fifteen hundred holy warriors that may attain martyrdom in the path of Allah.

The commander had said, ‘My boys better hurry up the caravan is moving because Allah knows better, but due to the crusaders making moves on Turkey, the door may be on its way to be closed.’

Alqudsi explained further that the commander had said, ‘More importantly brothers, you are missing out big time on the reward the companions sue to push each other to get to the front line.

‘God willing you boys better start pushing before the front lines are full.’

Mohamed told Alqudsi ‘the three doctors’ were ‘ready for the surgery’, himself and ‘two other doctors back home in New Zealand’. There was also ‘another doctor, but he didn’t have his surgical equipment ready’.

On another call Alqudsi and Mohamed discuss money and flight tickets. Four days later he calls to say he has acquired a new phone number ‘under an infidel’s name’ and is waiting for a passport.

Alqudsi instructs Mohamed to shave his beard and dress as a tourist and that all of the other ‘boys’ have left Turkey and have gone to the battlefield and that the ‘Amir’ has told him, ‘they will never come back until victory or martyrdom, so maybe you will never see them again’.

On September 16, Mohamed speaks with Alqudsi again and tells him that he has ‘everything locked and loaded’.

On September 21, Mohamed is detained at Brisbane airport and searched as he was trying to board a flight to Singapore.

On September 29, Alqudsi and his wife, Carnita Matthews attempt to board a flight at Sydney airport ‘for the stated purpose of attending the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Police confiscate Alqudsi’s passport.

On October 8, police intercept an sms alleged to be from Alqudsi to Nassim Elbahsa, which says, ‘You got the green light Akhi’ [Akhi means ‘brother’ in Arabic].

Elbasha allegedly flew out from Sydney bound for Abu Dhabi and Istanbul on October 12. In the transcript the police allege he calls Alqudsi and confirms he has reached Istanbul. On December 3, members of the Joint Counter Terrorist Team search Alqudsi’s house and place him under arrest.
