Fraudster: Helen Smith, 42, arranged fake music exams for five pupils at her Sheffield home

A piano teacher has been ordered to pay compensation to students who she tricked into taking bogus grade exams.

The pupils were told they had passed with flying colours at Helen Smith's home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire - but were devastated when their certificates never turned up.

Smith, 42, was found guilty of fraud after she arranged for a fake examiner to test the five pupils, three of whom were under 18.

She was spared jail today at Sheffield Magistrates Court, where she insisted the whole situation was an administrative mix-up.

Smith said: 'I think I have suffered quite a lot for something I don’t believe I’ve done, even now.'

In a separate case, the General Teaching Council had already banned Smith from teaching in schools for two years for claiming sick pay while on holiday.

During Smith’s trial last month, the court heard how students had paid fees and were tested on December 15, 2012.

Smith told magistrates she had arranged the exams in good faith with the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM).

But Lynne Butler, deputy head of UK operations for ABRSM, said the organisation had no record of any exam taking place and had not sent any examiner to the property.

The court heard that Sharon Copley, the mother of one of Smith’s teenage pupils, said she had already booked a Grade Five piano exam through official channels.

But Smith told her that her daughter should attend the test at her own house, where she was told she had passed before discovering the truth.

'She was absolutely devastated,' Ms Copley said.

'To be told by somebody you trusted that you have passed with a distinction and to then find out the person she looked up to hadn’t told the truth, she felt humiliated and let down. It knocked her for six.'

Smith said an administrative error by the board was possibly to blame for it having no record of the tests, nor of sending an examiner to the address on the day in question.

But she was convicted of six counts of fraud by abuse of position, and one of fraud by false representation between February 2012 and March 2013.

Smith, who was unrepresented, told the court she had been the victim of a hate campaign.

'I’ve had my house smashed, I’ve had threatening phone calls, I’ve had all the windows smashed and I feel very unsafe,' she said.

But District Judge Sheila Driver told her: 'You did hear from the victims when they gave evidence of the stress - particularly on the younger victims - when they realised they hadn’t achieved what they thought they had achieved.

'And the fact that they had to re-take exams they believed they had already passed.

'You attempted to involve yourself in a game of smoke and mirrors, but your evidence was inconsistent, not credible, and frankly nonsense.

'I am satisfied that all victims suffered a financial loss due to a false representation by you and I therefore find you guilty of all charges.'

Smith was sentenced to a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.

She was ordered to attend 15 sessions in Sheffield’s Together Women Project, and to pay £1,500 in compensation to her five victims at £50 per month.

She was also given a curfew order, under which she must remain at her home address between 7pm and 7am every day.
