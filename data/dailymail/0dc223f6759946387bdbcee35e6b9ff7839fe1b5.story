The heroic story of a humble librarian who became an all-action commando and was executed after a daring mission behind enemy lines has come to light 70 years after his death.  

Sergeant Thomas Handley was one of four commandos for the high-risk Special Operations Executive (SOE) - a secret espionage and sabotage force - caught by the Germans following an attempt to block the Corinth Canal in the Agean Sea by sinking a ship.

The Nazis forced the trained wireless operator to send false messages back to his SOE base in Cairo, Egypt, so they would send back information about future operations.

But brave Sgt Handley inserted 'tell tale' words into his messages so his superiors knew that he had been captured.

With this knowledge, the British sent back fake messages in order to hoodwink the Germans and supply them with misleading information that would have disrupted their movements of troops.

It took two months for the enemy to realise what Sgt Handley was up to, at which point he was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in north-east Germany.  

In early 1945, just months before the end of the war, Sgt Handley and the three other commandos were rounded up and shot by the SS.

Sgt Handley was awarded the Military Medal while he was a PoW for his brave actions but because of the nature of the SOE, dubbed Churchill's Secret Army, hardly anything was stated publicly about the award or what it was for.

Even his family did not know about the details until 2000, when relatives started researching him and unearthed previously-sealed secret documents.

An extract from the recommendation for the Military Medal reads: 'Without consideration of his personal safety, he took a grave risk the whole time in deliberately hoodwinking the enemy in a manner which has in other cases resulted in the immediate shooting of the operator.'

The medals, along with poignant telegrams sent from the War Office to Sgt Handley's parents which confirm his death, are now set to sell for £20,000 pounds at auction tomorrow.

A letter, sent from the War Office to Sgt Handley's family, confirms his date of death as April 10, 1945

Paul Laidlaw, of Laidlaw Auctioneers of Carlisle, Cumbria, said: 'It is the saddest of stories. What this man did and the bravery and sacrifice he made cannot be understated. 

'If a soldier is killed in action then that is the nature of war but this was a crime. Sgt Handley was murdered by evil men.

'His actions were beyond Boy's Own and derring-do stuff. He was a true hero whose bravery has been hidden for 70 years.

'For like many such bravery awards, it was requested that no details should be made public, nor communicated to the press - leaving Handley's family firmly in the dark for a lifetime.

'They thought he was a lowly signaller and had no idea of his SOE activity, which was an incredibly risky organisation to be in considering Hitler gave the infamous order that commandos should be summarily executed as spies if caught.'

Sgt Handley, from Sedbergh, Cumbria, worked in his local library until the outbreak of war in 1939, when he joined the Royal Signals.

He was one of the first volunteers for the SOE, a covert organisation that carried out espionage and sabotage missions behind enemy lines.

Sgt Handley underwent special training which included parachute training and is likely to have taken part in a number of secret operations before the raid on the Corinth Canal in 1943.

The four-man operation, led by Lieutenant Commander Michael Cumberlege, involved the team landing in uniform by submarine near Poros, Greece, with over two tons of munitions and explosives.

Despite interventions by Italian and German forces, the team managed to deposit the mines on a ship in the canal, however the explosives failed to detonate.

Although they got away following fire-fight, the Germans recovered one of their radios, complete with secret code books.

Sgt Handley later received a radio message, almost certainly sent by the Germans using the captured wireless set, advising the team of a rendezvous with a Royal Navy submarine. The meeting was a trap which finally led to the capture of the men.

They were brutally treated during their time in captivity.

Following the war, an investigation was launched into the fate of the party and a former British inmate of the concentration camp revealed the men suffered poor health and were emaciated.

They were last seen being transported out of the camp on April 10, 1945, to be shot. Sgt Handley was 30 years old at the time.
