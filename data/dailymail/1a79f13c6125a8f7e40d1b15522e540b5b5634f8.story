Englsh football fans are choosing to watch football abroad due to the rising cost of a Premier League match day.

Season-ticket holders at clubs like Borussia Dortmund are paying an average of just £9 a match compared to some English fans who regularly have to part at least four or five times that amount to see their favourite team.

Alarmingly, the cheapest match-day ticket price across the top four divisions of English football has increased by an average of 4.4 per cent over the last 12 months - nearly three times the rate of inflation - the BBC Price of Football survey revealed.

Add the price of food and travel to the initial cost of the matchday ticket and the overall total of following a Premier League team can easily reach three figures for many supporters.

Astonishingly, fans can fly out and enjoy a weekend trip to watch one of Europe's powerhouses for roughly the same price it costs to purchase a ticket to a Premier League game. 

'We jump on the Channel Tunnel train,' one fan told the BBC. 'We make a weekend of it. With tickets, accommodation, transport, this trip will cost £65. When you think it cost me £51 to see the Arsenal game last season, you can see the benefits.'

Some fans can travel abroad - paying for flights, accomodation and a match ticket - for the same price it costs to watch a Premier League match

Dortmund are keen to keep their prices down for fans and even refused PUMA's request to increase the price of the club's replica shirts. 

While prices continue to rise, Dortmund would prefer to ask sponsors for an injection of cash rather than their loyal followers.

The Bundesliga side's marketing director Carsten Cramer said: 'Why are tickets cheap? Football is part of people's lives and we want to open the doors for all of society. We need the people, they spend their hearts, their emotions with us. They are the club's most important asset.'

'What is the economic sense for the club to increase the price by 10 cents? For the overall economic success of the club it is not important to increase the price of a litre of a beer. It is still money, but not a lot to the club. But it does affect our fans, if they are spending their money match after match.'

Manager Jurgen Klopp is one of Dortmund's main attractions and has been with the club for the last six years
