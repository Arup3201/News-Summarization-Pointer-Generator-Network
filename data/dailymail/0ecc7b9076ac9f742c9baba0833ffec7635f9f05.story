The boss of Morrisons supermarket was fired  today after its founder told him management 'can't make excuses all the time' for poor sales.

Dalton Philips was forced out this morning after the business announced the worst Christmas results of any of the Big Four grocers - down 3.1 per cent in the past three months. 

Founder Sir Ken Morrison has been critical of Mr Philips' leadership and last year accused him of speaking 'bull****' during a board meeting.

Mr Philips told the BBC: 'I'm very sad to be leaving but when a board wants to make a change you accept that and move on. Tonight I will be going for a very large beer.

'I don't have another job to go to. My wife has given me a long list of chores to do'.

Andrew Higginson, who is due to become chairman later this month, said the company's board believed the push to return the business to growth was 'best done under new leadership.

'I think Dalton's had a good run,' he added. 'It's a judgement call. In essence, we just feel it's time for a fresh look to try and regain some of that trading momentum.'

With the company's new chairman calling for a 'fresh pair of eyes' over the business, shares in Morrisons surged by four per cent, 7.65p, to 184.5p. 

It also announced that it will shut 10 unprofitable stores with the loss of 400 jobs. 

Today former  Morrisons director Roger Owen called for a board clear-out saying the Bradford-based grocer has proved 'they are not capable of running a school tuck shop'. 

Sainsbury's suffered its worst Christmas in a decade with like-for-like sales down 1.7 per cent and at Tesco comparable sales in the the three months to start of January were down 2.9 per cent. 

Sainsbury's has announced plans to cut 500 jobs as part of a streamlining of its central operations. 

Dalton Philips will leave  after a bitter row with founder Sir Ken Morrison, who yesterday launched a fresh attack on the management ahead of disappointing festive sales.

Sir Ken Morrison told the Mail: 'I think management has been somewhat remiss in the way they are running the business. They can't make excuses all the time.

'The only thing I'm interested in is performance,' he said. 

Morrison, whose family still hold a minority stake in the firm, had criticised the strategy being used by Dalton Philips and accused him of speaking 'bull****'. 

Morrison appears to be just as vexed, although choosing less incendiary language.

Poor year: Morrisons has suffered declining sales in each quarter although sales have improved

Back in June Morrison told Philips that despite owning cattle 'you have a lot more bull**** than I do.' He also said the group's losses were 'disastrous'.

Morrisons along with all of its major rivals have been suffering fierce competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. 

More than half of all British households visited at least one of the two retailers over the 12 weeks to January 4, latest research from Kantar Worldpanel showed. It added that Aldi's market share rose to 4.8 per cent from 4 per cent a year earlier while Lidl surged to 3.5 per cent from 3.1 per cent a year ago.

With upmarket supermarket Waitrose also making progress, the UK's four main grocers all lost market share in the three-month period.

Overall, prices were 0.9 per cent lower on a like-for-like basis in the period due to lower commodity costs and the continuing price war.

High Street expert Phil Dorrell, of Retail Remedy, said: ‘If other members of the big four supermarkets are the squeezed middle, Morrisons is being steamrollered flat.

‘The departure of its chief executive was grimly inevitable. With the most dated stores and weakest business strategy of the old-guard grocers, Morrisons has haemorrhaged both sales and share to the brash young discounters who took its cheap-prices unique selling point, improved it, and then unceremoniously yanked the rug from underneath it.

‘The biggest surprise in these grim results is the decision to close just ten stores.’

Sainsbury's is set to axe 500 jobs as part of the latest round of cost-cutting in the supermarket industry.

The chain said its proposals for the streamlining of its central operations will require around 500 fewer roles, spread across all divisions and grades in its store support centres.

The steps form part of the £500 million in cost savings outlined by the retailer in a strategic review published in November.

It has already announced plans to mothball a number of schemes in its property pipeline and intends to reduce the amount of money spent on new space over the next three years. 

In a letter to staff, chief executive Mike Coupe said: 'We want to work through this period of uncertainty as quickly as possible, while making sure we consult with colleagues who are affected by these changes.

'We're committed to treating all impacted colleagues with respect, during what we know will be a difficult time.

'I recognise that these changes will be difficult for our colleagues and I can assure you the decision to make them was not taken lightly. However, I'm certain that we will be in a stronger position to deliver our new strategy and better equipped to win in these times of change as a result.'
