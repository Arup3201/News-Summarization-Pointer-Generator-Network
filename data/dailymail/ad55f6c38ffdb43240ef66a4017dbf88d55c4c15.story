When Luiz Felipe Scolari chooses the man to fill Neymar’s golden boots in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, he knows it is a decision that could shape Brazil’s World Cup destiny.

No-one can properly replace Neymar. Scolari is aware of that and so are his players. From the moment the mercurial star was carried off with a fractured vertebrae in Fortaleza on Friday, the victim of a crude Colombian knee in the back, the host nation feared that their dreams may have disappeared with him.

Brazil have no choice but to try and pick themselves up for Tuesday’s World Cup semi-final against Germany at the Estadio Mineirao, while Scolari must pick the right man to take Neymar’s place. It’s a huge call.

Decision time: 'Big Phil' Scolari must choose between Willian and Bernard to replace his No 10

The task is likely to fall to one of two players. In the diminutive Bernard, Scolari has the nearest like-for-like replacement for Neymar; a nimble, tricky forward capable of producing a piece of magic that could stop the German machine in its tracks.

In Chelsea’s Willian, the Brazil coach possesses a more reliable option and one he seems more likely to take.

Whichever choice Scolari makes will offer an insight into his thinking. Take the game to Germany or dig in. Without Neymar to light up a rather ordinary Brazil team, you suspect he will go for the latter.

Willian is a conscientious and disciplined midfielder who has shown during his first season under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea that he is prepared to sacrifice himself for the greater good of the team. He will keep possession, make his tackles and track back to protect his defence – all qualities that will be sorely needed against a ruthless German side. In short, he has more to offer than Bernard though without that spark of genius.

Functional: Willian is known for his willingness to track back and defend from wide

He also has a good understanding with his Chelsea team-mate Oscar, who could occupy Neymar’s withdrawn role and interchange with Willian who usually starts on the right-hand side.

‘We played a lot together last season at Chelsea,’ said Willian. ‘We were free to move around and we are very familiar with each other’s games. If Scolari does choose me, it won’t be a problem for us because we have had a year of playing together.’

For the 25-year-old, the return to Belo Horizonte represents an opportunity he feared may have disappeared when he missed a penalty in the shootout there against Chile after coming on as a substitute in extra-time. Willian’s other two appearances in the tournament have been off the bench against Mexico and Cameroon, replacing Neymar on the second occasion. However he insists that it is pointless drawing comparisons.

Creative spark: Bernard has the potential to be a match winner for Brazil

‘There’s no comparing us. We have different styles. Yes, some things are similar, such as our speed and dribbling, but Neymar is a striker whereas I am more a midfielder who sets up others. Neymar scores a lot of goals, whereas I am more someone who serves my team-mates.

‘Neymar sets the standard for us. He is capable of deciding any game, so playing without him will be difficult.’

For the man who replaced Willian at Shakhtar Donetsk last summer, a semi-final appearance would be even more emotional. Bernard was born and raised in Belo Horizonte and played for Atletico Mineiro until his £21.5million move to Ukraine. The local hero will become a national icon if he can help steer Brazil into the World Cup final.

At 5ft 5in, you fear that Bernard is in danger of being crushed by his German opponents. He offers none of the efficiency, defensive solidity or tactical reliability of Willian.

Yet the man described by Scolari as having ‘joy in his legs’ might also be Brazil’s ace in the pack; a player capable of producing a moment of magic, something out of nothing, just like the talisman they have lost to injury. The question is, can Brazil afford to gamble?

So far the 21-year-old’s contribution has been limited – a half-time substitute against Mexico and a second-half appearance off the bench against Croatia – but he is ready if needed.

‘We have to be prepared,’ said Bernard. ‘We are all very sad (about Neymar) but we have to overcome it. This is a World Cup semi-final and the players have to be prepared, psychologically and emotionally. We have lots of other good players and we can still beat Germany and be the champions.’

To do so, Brazil will have to raise their game another level without Neymar. Willian or Bernard must fill those golden boots, and now it’s down to Scolari to decide. For Big Phil, it’s a hell of a big call.
