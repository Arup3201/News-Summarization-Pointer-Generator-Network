Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie and Foreign Secretary William Hague called Bosnia's decision to include preventing sexual violence in military training ‘ground-breaking’ and said that it should become the standard for U.N. peacekeeping missions.

Mr Hague added that rape was a devastatingly effective way to terrorise and displace a population and is currently being used in Syria, the Central African Republic and South Sudan.

Jolie said the training was especially important for peacekeepers as their patrols ‘can mean that women no longer have to face a choice between going out for firewood and water and being raped or seeing their children go hungry.’

Mr Hague and Jolie visited widows and mothers of genocide victims in Srebrenica - a Bosnian town where Serb forces killed more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in 1995. Jolie came out of the meeting crying.

The comments came on the heels of a plea by António  Guterres, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that huge numbers of Syrian refugees flooding into Lebanon could lead to civil war war.

His comments were echoed by Jolie, a special envoy for the UNHCR.

Jolie recently met a family living in a Lebanese refugee camp and spoke to Hala, a young girl with five siblings.

Hala saw her mother killed under their collapsed home, and their father is missing and presumed dead.

‘Lebanon has serious problems with electricity and water,' said Mr Guterres, 'and largely
because of this huge increase in population; the health system is totally
overburdened, and the security implications of the Syrian crisis to Lebanon are
absolutely dramatic.

‘Nobody can afford the collapse of Lebanon in the present moment.’

Jolie had met William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, in Downing Street to discuss tackling rape in war zones, before flying out to Bosnia and Herzegovina to meet victims.

Once there they hailed Bosnia's decision to include prevention of sexual violence in military training.

The pair addressed a conference on sexual violence in conflict, organised in Sarajevo by Bosnia's Defence Ministry, saying the ‘ground-breaking’ policy should become standard for any armed forces serving in UN peacekeeping missions.

Jolie said the initiative is ‘redefining soldiering in the 21st century’.

Mr Hague promised the UK will support a planned training centre in Sarajevo for future military and police peacekeepers from the region.

He added that rape is a cheap and devastatingly effective way to terrorise and displace a population and is being used currently in Syria, Central African Republic and South Sudan.

Before they reached Sarajevo the pair were the focus of an intense police effort, worthy of one of her  films, complete with black screens, security guards and a number of policemen to get her across London - and away from the eyes of the public.

The actress was taken from her London hotel in a black government car to Downing Street for a meeting with Mr Hague.

Accompanied by a police convoy, including motorcycles and unmarked police cars, she and the Foreign Secretary were taken to an airport, where they boarded a private plane for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The actress spent around 12 hours in the UK, arriving on Wednesday night when she attended a drinks reception, followed by dinner with Mr Hague at his office.

The Metropolitan Police Force refused to 
comment on the specific security arrangements of Jolie's visit but a
 spokesman told MailOnline: 'We never discuss specifics of security but 
if Jolie was with Government officials as part of her UN duties, 
that would explain a police presence.'

Last year Jolie and Mr Hague travelled to  the Democratic Republic of Congo, where they met survivors of rape.

Their visit to Sarajevo comes ten weeks ahead of the three-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict at which they will be the co-chairmen in London in June.

In November Mr Hague pledged funding of more than £250,000 over 
three years to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the 
Department of Field Support to develop training as first responders to 
rape and sexual violence.

Speaking of their mission to Bosnia, Mr Hague said: 'Tens of thousands of women, girls and men were raped during the war in Bosnia.

'We are visiting to draw the world’s attention to their search for justice, and to call for global action to end the use of rape as a weapon of war once and for all.

Jetting off: Angelina Jolie and William Hague will meet victims of sexual violence from the war in Bosnia, which ran between 1992 and 1995

'In
 London in ten weeks’ time we will be asking nations around the world to
 make that decisive commitment, so that from Bosnia to the DRC survivors
 get the justice they need, and future mass rape can be prevented.

'We can and must change the entire global attitude to these crimes, and shatter the culture of impunity.'

Arrival: William Hague and Angelina Jolie together as they arrived in Sarajevo

Purpose: William Hague and Angelina Jolie will also meet judges and prosecutors in the country who are working to address the huge backlog of sexual violence cases

Injustice: Angelina Jolie described the use of rape as a weapon of war as 'one of the great injustices of our time'

Jolie added: 'The use of rape as a weapon of war is one of the great injustices of our time. For too long the world has tolerated these crimes, and left survivors to struggle in the shadows.

'Our goal is to bring forward the voices of the survivors of these crimes and to ask the world to stand with them and against impunity.'

Jolie was appointed a Special Envoy of UN High Commissioner for Refugees by António Guterres in April 2012.

Meeting: During the visit the pair will also speak at a regional military conference of ministers and senior officers
