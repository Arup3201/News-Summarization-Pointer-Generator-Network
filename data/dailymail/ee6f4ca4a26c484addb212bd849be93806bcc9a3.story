She will star in the new gymnastic reality show Tumble in just under two weeks and it seems that all those cartwheels have been paying off because Lucy Mecklenburgh looks incredibly toned in her new beauty campaign.

Lucy is the new ambassador for Sunkissed - a tanning and bronzing cosmetics brand - and as a fake tan devotee, she is the perfect fit.

The reality TV star, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, shows off her honed physique and golden glow as she poses in a series of images for the brand.

Sharing her first ever fake tanning experience, Lucy said: 'I was about 12 or 13 when I first 
started using fake tan. It was me and Sam Faiers after school and it was
 really hard back then to get a good tan for a reasonable price so 
we got these cheap wipes.

Glow getter: Lucy Mecklenburgh, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has been unveiled as the new face of Sunkissed and has shared her beauty secrets

'We looked really streaky and we 
absolutely stank. I've definitely learned over the years that it's 
trial and error with fake tan.'

Lucy, who always has a flawless glow and never looks less than immaculate, maintains that it only takes her fifteen minutes to get ready in the morning.

She said: 'It literally takes me about 15 minutes 
to get ready. I put a little bit of bronzer on, some 
mascara or a pink lipstick to finish the look.'

Body coincidence: Lucy said that while she was never particularly sporty at school, she developed a love of fitness later on in life and it's helped boost her self-confidence

The 22-year-old says that the best piece of beauty advice she's 
ever been given was by her grandmother who told her to always wear a strong factor SPF.

She cites her biggest beauty splurge as her tattooed semi-permanent 
brows. 'It's just so much easier in the morning not having to pencil them
 on every day. It's made my life a lot easier,' she said.

While many women aspire to look just like Lucy, who regularly tops best beauty and body polls, the former TOWIE star looks up to someone else.

'My beauty icon is Jessica Alba. She's always got a lovely natural, healthy glow and she always dresses amazingly,' she said.

Lucy, who has built a successful fitness empire called Results With Lucy, says that being in good shape has helped her with her body confidence.

'Exercise definitely helps with your confidence and builds your self esteem,' she said. 'That's why I set up Results With Lucy, to help other girls feel the way I did. Toning up fills you with confidence, it makes you feel better in yourself.'

And judging by her new campaign imagery, which sees her oozing confidence, her newfound love of fitness has paid off.

A spokesperson for Sunkissed added: 'We are delighted to be working with Lucy this year. It’s an absolute bonus that she loves our products and they look fantastic on her. It’s a perfect match.'
