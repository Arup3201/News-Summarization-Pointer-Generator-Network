Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino expects Harry Kane to get even better after the young Englishman took his tally to 20 goals for the season. 

Pochettino said: 'It is good for him, good for the team and good for us. It was a great performance. Always when the strikers score goals it is good for the team.

'But I think always my focus is that a player can improve. He is young and, like other players, needs to show that he can improve. You cannot stop your improvement.'
