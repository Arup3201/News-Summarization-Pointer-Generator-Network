The Chicago Department of Aviation said Thursday that at least 450 flights out of O'Hare and 300 flights from Midway were canceled due to weather, with more delayed.

The news comes a day after the Federal Aviation Administration said O'Hare airport is still only at 85 percent capacity and Midway at 80 percent after an employee set fire to Chicago's air traffic control center, triggering a shutdown.

Southwest says it is cancelled all of its flights from Midway airport after noon Thursday due to incoming storms.

Delays: A line of passengers at O'Hare on September 26 tries to reschedule flights that were canceled. More delays are now likely as 750 flights out of Chicago were canceled due to weather.

'With an 80 percent coverage of rain forecast for Chicago, these proactive cancellations are aimed at minimizing surprises for our customers,' Southwest spokesperson Dan Landson told CBS.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel criticized the FAA and wondered how the agency had 'no backup capacity' considering O'Hare is one of the country's busiest airports.

'My first concern is getting O'Hare up and operating at 100 percent,' Emanuel said at a news conference Wednesday according to DNAinfo.

'O'Hare is a central part of our economy, our competitiveness,' he continued. 'Over the weekend, I was on the phone with FAA telling them they have to get this open, up and running.'

The FAA contends that in spite of crippled capacity, its controllers still managed more flights on Tuesday at O'Hare International Airport than anywhere else as the airport recovers. 

Officials say FAA technicians are working around-the-clock to restore telecommunications services at the Chicago En Route Center in Aurora. 

They say workers already have installed some of the new communications equipment, but still have to lay miles of new cable. 

Brian Howard, 36, of the Chicago suburb Naperville is accused of setting the fire before attempting to kill himself with a knife.

A telecommunications field technician, Howard was upset over a transfer to Hawaii, according to the criminal complaint.
