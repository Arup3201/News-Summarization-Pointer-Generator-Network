Investigators probing the theft of Michael Schumacher's medical notes believe a helicopter firm contacted by doctors looking to transfer the former racing driver from a hospital in France to Switzerland may have been involved in the disappearance. 

Schumacher, 45, suffered a major head injury when he fell while skiing in France in December and was kept in a medically induced coma for six months after the accident. 

Schumacher  was recently transferred from the hospital in Grenoble, France to a unit near his Swiss home, allowing his wife Corinna to attend a public event at her ranch in Givrins.

Media in France and Switzerland said that prosecutors in Grenoble, France are currently looking a computer IP address which belongs to a Swiss helicopter firm who were consulted during the rescue.

Prosecutors have not named the company publicly, but they have been working with authorities in Switzerland on the case. 

Medics in Grenoble are believed to have contacted the company while discussing the possibility of flying the former Formula 1 champion to Switzerland to continue his recovery.  

The records, which are believed to consist of several pages of medical notes outlining the extent of the injury suffered by Schumacher. 

Last month, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm revelaed that the documents had been 'clearly stolen', warning that anyone buying or publishing the 'confidential files' would be prosecuted. 

It is understood that the notes were offered for sale across Europe to media organisations for £40,000.

According to the BBC, the new information was reported in French newspaper Le Dauphine Libere. 

Initially it was believed that a hospital worker or a member of the ambulance team that transferred Schumacher from France to Switzerland may have been behind the theft.  

The latest development emerged in French newspaper Le Dauphine Libere, and Swiss media said it had been confirmed by the prosecutor in Grenoble.

Suspicions had initially fallen on the hospital in Grenoble and the ambulance team which eventually drove him across the border.

According to the Grenoble prosecutor, the computer was traced back to a helicopter company in the Swiss canton of Zurich. The company's name has not been made public.

The file had been sent to a doctor at the company, although there was nothing to link the doctor to the alleged offence.

It is thought the findings of the French inquiry will now be handed to the authorities in Switzerland.

Ms Kehm said: 'We cannot judge if these documents are authentic. However, the documents are clearly stolen. The theft has been reported.’

Schumacher’s office will ‘press for criminal charges and damages’ if the documents and data are made public, Kehm said.

Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm warned media outlets that they face prosecution if they either buy or publish her client's medical records which have been 'clearly stolen', confirming the theft has been reported
