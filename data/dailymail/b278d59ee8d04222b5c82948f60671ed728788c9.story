A Secret Service agent on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign plane accidentally left a gun in the plane's bathroom.

The gun was discovered in the restroom by a CBS News/National Journal reporter traveling with Romney shortly before he departed the Republican convention in Florida to address the American Legion convention in Indianapolis on Wednesday.

Because of her actions, the member of Mr Romney’s security detail has been removed from the campaign trip.

Business as usual: Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney steps off his campaign charter plane in Tampa today after a Secret Service agent accidentally left her gun in one of the lavatories

Discovery: A CBS reporter found the gun and immediately alerted the agent; Romney never appeared to be in danger

Prior engagement: Romney had been speaking to the American Legion National Convention in Indianapolis and was flying back to Tampa

ABC News reported that the agent accidentally left her weapon in the plane’s bathroom on a flight between Tampa, Florida, and Indiana.

The reporter who discovered the weapon immediately told the Secret Service agent, who immediately went back to retrieve it.

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said on Wednesday that the 'matter will be handled internally.'

'We're aware of the incident,' Donovan told CBS News. 'We take the care and custody of our equipment, especially firearms, very seriously.'

Mr Romney never appeared to be in any danger as he travelled with a small group of staff, Secret Service agents, and journalists.

The restroom in question was at the back of the plane, used mostly by members of the media.

Protection: Ann Romney, pictured Wednesday night, was recently afforded a security detail

Mr Romney and his immediate staff sits near the front of the plane and uses the bathroom nearest the front of the cabin.

Earlier this week, Ann Romney was granted a Secret Service detail ahead of the Republican National Convention.

A campaign aide to Mitt Romney later confirmed to ABC News that Ann - his wife of 42 years - was first assigned Secret Service protection on Friday afternoon, days before her husband formally accepted the presidential nomination.

Typically, the protection is authorised for the president, vice president and those in the line of succession to become president, as well as former presidents and all spouses and children, as well as visiting foreign heads of state.

In addition, presidential and vice presidential candidates are afforded the serves, within 120 days of the presidential election.

The government organisation was instructed in 1901 to insure the safety of the Commander-in-Chief, after the assassination of William McKinley. It had existed in previous incarnations to combat counterfeit currency.

Only this year, the service was embattled in a scandal, involving a prostitute in Cartagena, Columbia.

As a result, nine agents were punished, but none were formally charged.

All's well: Romney watched television coverage of the RNC with five of his grandchildren in Tampa Wednesday
