Tragedy: Peter Fedden died in a July 2013 car crash, while allegedly driving drunk. His mother is now filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the cops who didn't arrest him during his first crash that night

A woman is suing the police for $30million, claiming they are to blame for her son's death since they didn't arrest him for drunk driving.

Kathi Fedden's 29-yer-old son Peter died in July 2013, after getting into two drunk-driving crashes in one night in Commack, New York.

Instead of arresting Peter after the first crash, responding officers drove the popular deli owner back to his mothers house.

Just 30 minutes later, an inebriated Peter sped off in his mother's car to die in another accident, Newsday reports.

According to the wrongful death lawsuit filed this week, Peter had downed at least 10 oz of Jack Daniels and smoked marijuana before getting behind the wheel to leave a Ruby Tuesdays the night of July 30, 2013 around 11:30pm.

With two passengers in the car, Peter was speeding at 90 miles per hour when he lost control of his vehicle ramming straight through a fence, across two lawns and into a parked car in a driveway.

Many of the responding officers recognized Peter from the Commack Breakfast Diner, a restaurant he owned where he treated cops like kings- charging them just $1 for everything.

Mrs Fedden alleges that this is what caused them to go lenient on her son, driving him home instead of arresting him and holding him overnight to sober up.

That plan backfired when 30 minutes later, Peter stole his mom's car and sped off again, this time getting into a much more serious car accident.

It's believed he may have been travelling at speeds of more than 100 miles an hour when he crashed into the brick facade of an industrial park and died.

Suffolk County officials didn't comment, citing the litigation.
