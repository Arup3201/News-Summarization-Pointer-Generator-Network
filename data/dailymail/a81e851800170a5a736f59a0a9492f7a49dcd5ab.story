Charlie Webster was back on Sky Sports News after she angered colleagues for posing in her underwear for this month's edition of 'lads' mag' FHM.

The 30-year-old presenter kept hold of her weekend shift, and hosted the Saturday mid-morning slot alongside Adam Leventhal.

Charles Sale's Sports Agenda last week broke news of disquiet at Sky Sports HQ over the raunchy shoot, casting her long-term future with the broadcast giant into doubt.

But cover girl Webster, an occasional host 
unlike core presenters Hayley McQueen, Natalie Sawyer and Kirsty 
Gallacher, has kept her Saturday shift despite the considerable upset.

More
 pictures emerged last week of Webster's modelling past from 2004. 
Described then as a lingerie model, the shoot took place several years before Sheffield-born Webster began working for the TV network in 2010.

The FHM pictures of the glamorous Webster in
 her underwear has especially upset a number of her female colleagues, 
who feel such exposure can only damage their efforts to be taken 
seriously as broadcast journalists and become known for the quality of 
their work rather than their looks.

And Webster will not have helped her career prospects either 
with her disparaging take on SSN’s biggest production of the year:

‘On 
transfer deadline day, if it’s quiet, we’ll mess about passing blank 
pieces of paper pretending they’re breaking news stories. Everyone does 
it. It can be hilarious.’

SSN
 top brass are also angered that Webster’s photo spread comes at a time 
when the station are giving more prominence to the achievements of women
 in sport.

Charlie Webster (right, presenting Sky Sports News) has laughed off her glamour girl image, insisting she's just a down-to-earth Sheffield lass with a love of the beautiful game.

The 30-year-old's TV career has taken her around the world with stints at Real Madrid TV, presenting Premier League football for ESPN and Sky Sports News.

It was all a world away from Bramall Lane where Sheffield United fan Webster got her first taste of football.

She told the MSN website: 'I used to go with my dad all the time as he had a season ticket. And then at half-time I used to sit drinking Bovril and eating fish-and-chips crisps, they’re some of my first memories of watching the football, it was always the Bovril treat.'

Webster says she has not changed despite all the attention.

'I’m not your typical girl in that sense,' she admits. 'I’ve never really thought I had looks or whatever, and I don’t see myself like that at all. I see myself as just a down-to-earth Northern girl that’s doing alright.'

Webster has used her profile to highlight the problems of childhood abuse after revealing she was abused as a teenage athlete.

She told the News of the World: 'I went through a phase of cutting myself. I’ve still got scars on my wrist. I thought I was worthless. I hated myself. You believe what is wrong is your fault.

'But I’ve learned survival is the most powerful thing ever. I want to show people you can come from anything and make something of yourself even if you are an abuse survivor.'
