A dramatic rescue mission is underway to save three people aboard a boat hit by a huge hurricane.

The boat, named Walkabout, was hit by Hurricane Julio, which whipped up 155mph winds and 30ft waves, blowing a hatch off the boat and washing away its life raft.

A terrifying picture released by the Coast Guard shows the rough seas the crew face, as they battle to keep their yacht afloat as it takes on water.

The three sailors, who have not been identified, sent out a Mayday message on Sunday morning and the Coast Guard is now co-ordinating their rescue. 

A HC-130 Hercules plane arrived on the scene at around 1:10pm local time yesterday to drop off life rafts to the stricken crew, but they were unable to reach them because of the huge waves which are battering the 42ft boat.

A nearby container ship, Manukai, has now reached the sailors and will attempt a rescue at dawn.

Operations Specialist Andrew Lincoln said: 'The seas were really bad and it's kind of windy so [the Manukai crew] didn't want to do it in the dark. 

'If seas were calm they'd pull up to the sailing vessel and [the three sailors] would climb up what's called a Jacob's ladder.

'But it's really rough out there so if [the Manukai] did that they'd end up running over that sailing vessel.' 

An earlier statement from the Coast Guard said: 'The Coast Guard is coordinating the rescue of a 42-foot sailboat caught in Hurricane Julio 414 miles northeast of Oahu Sunday.

'Sailing vessel Walkabout is disabled and taking on water with three people aboard. On-scene conditions are reported as 92 to 115 mph winds with 30-foot seas.

'One of the hatches has blown away and onboard bilge pumps are unable to keep up with the rate of flooding. The vessel's life raft has also been blown overboard.' 

Hurricane Julio, which was recently downgraded to category 1 - the lowest level of hurricane - is believed to be moving away from the area.

Just last week Hawaii was battered by tropical storm Iselle, which toppled trees and power lines causing outages in parts of Maui.

At least 50 flights were cancelled on Thursday because of the storm, but airlines have resumed normal service now.
