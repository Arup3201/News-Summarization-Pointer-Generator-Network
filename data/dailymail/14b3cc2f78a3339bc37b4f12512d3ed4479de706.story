Family and friends of Henrietta Regina Dickson, the woman killed in a Tampa, Florida carport on Wednesday after a resident unknowingly ran her over and pinned her arm to the ground, have spoken out and revealed a surprising insight into her past.

Dickson, 55, was found Wednesday morning under a 2002 Daewoo sedan owned by Fathima Masoud, 55. Masoud had pulled into the carport at 11:30pm the previous evening, and did not see Dickson sleeping in the parking space, although she felt a bump as he pulled in.

According to Masoud, she saw a tote bag belonging to Dickson. However, she guessed that it was the object that she had ran over, and moved it out of the lot.

At approximately 8am the next morning, a passerby saw a hand under one of the wheels of Masoud's vehicle. Dickson was found, and pronounced dead at the scene. Masoud has not been charged for the accident.

The story is a sad tale of the invisibility of those living on the streets, something heightened in poignancy when Dickson's relatively comfortable background and sad fall into homelessness is considered.

Raymond Scahefer, 52, said Dickson had moved into his apartment weeks prior to the incident. The two had met while working as cleaning staff at Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays.

The two became fast friends, Schaefer never even learning her last name, and when Dickson lost her job, Schaefer let her stay with him until she got back on her feet. He recalls her vibrant personality and love for the Rays baseball team.

'She was just fun to be around,' Schaefer told The Tampa Bay Times, 'except when she was drinking.'

It
 did not take long before Dickson showed up at the apartment drunk and 
belligerent. Schaefer, himself a recovering alcoholic, told her to take 
her belongings and leave. He never saw her again until he picked up a 
newspaper on Thursday morning, then seeing his former roommate's 
picture.

The woman on the cover of the newspaper was a far cry from Henrietta Dickson that her family had once known. Dickson was the youngest of four children born in Highland Park, Illinois.

Described by her older brother David Dickson as having a personality that 'lit up the room,' Dickson soon moved to Paris with her mother after her parents divorced. She attended private school there, and eventually earned a degree from American College.

Dickson then returned to the United States, where she went to live with her father and earn a Master's degree from Florida International University, in Miami. Dickson planned on pursuing a career in the fragrance industry, and enjoyed a successful life until her late 20s.

In 1989, Dickson's father passed away from a heart attack. After this, Henrietta developed crippling addictions to drugs and alcohol, causing her to be unable to hold down a steady job as she received certifications from different programs she drifted between, attempting to find a career to stick with.

In 2006, she married a registered sex offender. She was later arrested for battery and drunken driving.

Her family claimed that they attempted to help her pull out of her destructive lifestyle, even helping her into a rehabilitation program in Tampa, which she completed. However, she was unable to maintain her sobriety.

'She was a young lady who had every possible advantage and then something happened,'Â  said David Dickson, 'and I don't even know what.'

Police
 believe that Dickson was on alcohol and drugs when she was run over. 
Inside of her tote bag was $16.29 in cash, four cellphones, makeup, 
shampoo, prescription medications, old tax returns and job applications.

The family is set to have Henrietta cremated and plan to travel to Florida for a small and private service.
