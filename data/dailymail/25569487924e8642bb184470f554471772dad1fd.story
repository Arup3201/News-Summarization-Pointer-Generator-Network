Kei Nishikori fought back from a set down to beat alternate David Ferrer in his final Group B match at the ATP World Tour Finals in London.

Nishikori’s 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over Ferrer means that Andy Murray has to beat Roger Federer in straight sets at the O2 Arena on Thursday night to qualify for the semi-finals.

Federer, meanwhile, is already guaranteed progression to the last four by virtue of Ferrer winning a set.

1. If Roger Federer defeats Andy Murray, then Federer wins the group and Kei Nishikori qualifies in second place.

2. If Andy Murray defeats Roger Federer in straight sets, then Murray wins the group and Federer qualifies in second place.

3. If Andy Murray defeats Roger Federer in three sets, then Federer wins the group and Kei Nishikori qualifies in second place. 

But the Swiss will no doubt go all out for the win against Murray to avoid a likely semi-final clash with world No 1 Novak Djokovic.

Nishikori had ironically eliminated Ferrer from the Race to London two weeks ago by beating him in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters.

But the pair faced off again here after world No 10 Ferrer replaced Milos Raonic, who pulled out on Thursday morning with a muscle tear in his thigh.

Although Ferrer could not qualify, there was plenty at stake with 200 ranking points and an extra £98,500 in prize money if he could win.

Ferrer had two chances to break in the fifth game but could not convert and Nishikori made him pay in the next game with a clean forehand cross-court winner for the break.

Nishikori faltered when trying to consolidate and Ferrer broke back before later breaking for the set as the nervy Japanese dumped a smash into the net.

However, world No 5 Nishikori instantly mounted a comeback as he broke in the opening game of the second set.

Ferrer stayed within touch and forced Nishikori to serve the second set out which he duly did to level the match.

This was the first three-set match of the week and Nishikori would have felt confident heading into the decider with an impressive 20-2 record in matches that have gone the distance this year.

And he cruised to victory as an immediate break proved demoralising for Ferrer and Nishikori won five of the next six games to seal victory in one hour and 56 minutes.
