An eight-year-old girl was 'slapped, kicked' and given a bloody eye by sick thugs stole her beloved dog while she took it for a walk.

Beth Lannetta and sister Kathryn, 14, took their dogs Star and her sister Molly for a walk from their home in Newport, Wales at around 8.30pm on Thursday.

The pair split up to keep the dogs calm, and Beth, 8, had headed off to nearby rugby and football fields when she was approached by two girls.

The girls then slapped and kicked her, telling the terrified youngster that her pet Cavalier King Charles spaniel was now theirs.

Since the attack Beth's family have appealed for help to trace Star who was bundled on to a bus by the thieves.

Her family claim Beth also escaped being snatched. The girls told the youngster they had a child ticket for her, but she refused to join them on the bus.

Star is a white and tan - known as Blenheim - coloured Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

Beth's mother Llinos Lannetta said: 'They told her it was their dog and stopped Beth from coming home.

'They made her walk into Caerleon before hitting her over the head, slapping, and kicking her. Then they took Star off her.

'Beth followed them down Mill Lane and they told her that if she knocked on a particular door they would give her the dog back.

'She knocked on the door but the girls ran off. Star was pulling back on her lead because she could see Beth, so she ran behind them and they got to the bus stop outside the Hanbury Arms.

'They then told her they had a child ticket so she could go with them. Luckily, Beth realised she would have to leave the dog and she ran home.

'By then it was gone nine, I'd panicked, and we were out looking for her. Then we got a phone call from home when she got back.'

Beth gave a detailed account to police about what had happened and retraced the route.

Mrs Lannetta said: 'It's awful. I can't believe how anyone would want to do this.

'Beth's been very brave but she's very upset and I've taken her to see the doctor because she had a bit of blood in an eye after being hit.'

Her pet dog Star is nearly four-years-old and was wearing a red collar with yellow paws on it when snatched.

Mrs Lannetta said: 'We're very worried and missing her. Everywhere Beth goes, Star goes, and Molly was barking the whole night because she's missing her sister.

'We've only been in the house a couple of weeks, so she won't know her way home if she's loose. Hopefully from the picture someone will recognise her. We just want her back.'

Gwent Police said last night two girls, one aged 12, the other 13, have been arrested on suspicion of robbery in connection with the incident, and were in custody. Star remains missing.
