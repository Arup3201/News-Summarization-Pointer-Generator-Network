A 30-year-old man has been cleared of murder after a jury agreed his actions were justified after he shot an escort when she took his money but refused to have sex with him.

Lenora Frago was shot in the neck by Ezekiel Gilbert on Christmas Eve 2009. The 23-year-old was paralyzed and died several months later.

A Bexar County Texas court acquitted Mr Gilbert, who had been facing a life sentence, of murder because he was trying to retrieve stolen property.

His defense team argued that the 
shooting was not intended to kill Miss Frago and his actions were 
justified because he believed sex was included as part of the fee.

In Texas, residents are allowed to 'to use deadly force to recover property during
a nighttime theft'.

Miss Frago, who had been dependent on a respirator after being left paralyzed in the shooting, died in July 2010.

She had suffered brain damage after the respirator disconnected a few months after she was shot.

Miss Frago's brother wept earlier in 
the trial as he recalled the moment the family decided to end her life 
support, according to My San Antonio.

Neurologist Augusto Parra also disagreed with the defense that her death was not Mr Gilbert's fault.

'When you are bedridden like her - 
with mechanical support, with tubes for feeding - these patients are 
prone ... to have complications,' Mr Parra said. 'She was in this 
situation because she was shot.'

The escort was shot in the early hours of Christmas Eve after Mr Gilbert confronted her driver about Miss Frago taking his money but refusing to have sex.

Christopher Perkins, who described himself as the young woman's manager, told the court earlier that the $150 fee did not include a guarantee of sex.

He added: 'Lenora normally would do lap dances and hanging out. That was her thing. Her regular customers were all quiet, reserved guys and she would hang out.'

Mr Perkins had been waiting in the car outside Mr Gilbert's Camino Real Apartments at about 4.15am when he confronted him with an assault rifle.

As he and Miss Frago sped away from the apartment, he fired the gun, with one of the bullets hittingÂ  the escort in the neck.

Mr Perkins told the court he remembered her saying: 'He's got a gun! Go! Go! Go!' before hearing the shots, according to the San Antonio Express-News.

Mr Gilbert told the court during his trial he was trying to shoot the back tires of their car to stop them while he called police to retrieve his money.

After being found not guilty of murder, Mr Gilbert hugged his defense attorneys and thanked God, his lawyers, and the jury for being able to 'see what wasn't the truth'.
