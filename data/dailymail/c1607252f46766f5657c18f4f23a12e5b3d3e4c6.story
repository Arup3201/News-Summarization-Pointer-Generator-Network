Manchester City are down and nearly out in the Champions League after yet another flop in Europe.

So bad is City's form that they have the second-worst record of all the league title winners who have made it into the Champions League this season.

That means the Premier League champions have a worse record than BATE Borisov, the Belarusian league winners, Ludogorets of Bulgaria, and Slovenian titans Maribor.

City's latest Euro misery came in the form of a home defeat by CSKA Moscow, leaving Manuel Pellegrini's side bottom of Group E and needing a miracle to progress into the knockout stages.

After four games their record reads: played four, won none, drawn two and lost two, with a total of two points to their name.

To highlight City's struggles, Sportsmail has created a table based on the results of all last season's European title winners so far in the Champions League. But this table is inversed, with the worst records sitting top of the league and the best at the bottom. This is not the Champions League - this is the Chump-ions League.

Bayern Munich have the best record of all Europe's title winners in the Champions League this season

Even Ludogorets of Bulgaria have a better record in this season's competition than City

Only Apoel Nicosia, here in action against PSG, have a worse record than the Premier League champions

Unsurprisingly German giants Bayern Munich boast the best record, with Pep Guardiola's team having secured four wins from four games in the Champions League this season. But that means they are bottom of the Chump-ions League.

City are second, with only Apoel Nicosia above them. The champions of Cyprus have just one point to their name in this season's competition.

It should be stressed that City can still qualify for the round of 16 in Europe's elite competition, but they will need to beat both Roma and Bayern Munich in their final two games to do so.

So it looks like they might have a better chance of topping the Chump-ions League this season.
