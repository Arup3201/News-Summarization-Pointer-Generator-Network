Monica Lewinsky, pictured, who has just turned 40, has never been married and does not have any children

He is a revered global statesman, courted by prime ministers and rock stars for his good works. She is on course to be the first woman president of the United States.

Few would bet against what is mockingly being called the ‘Clinton Restoration’ to the White House.

Political pundits have little doubt that Democrat Hillary Clinton will be powered to victory by her popular and politically brilliant husband, Bill, next year and the country that supposedly rejected monarchy centuries ago will have their royal family back on the throne.

When even Republican contenders are loath to throw their hats into the ring, fearing they will lose, who would dare rock the Clinton boat?

The answer came this week when a blast from the past has reappeared to cause damage — perhaps irreparable — to both of them.

Monica Lewinsky, the ‘other woman’ who embroiled the Clintons in one of the biggest political scandals of the last century, has broken more than a decade of silence.

In a long essay for Vanity Fair magazine, she has reminded America of an episode in Clinton history that was anything but glorious.

Between 1995 and 1997, President Clinton — then turning 50 — and the White House intern in her early 20s had an affair which ranged all over the White House. Their trysts took place in bathrooms, hallways, even the pantry.

Then, Lewinsky foolishly confided in a colleague, who advised the naive intern to preserve any evidence of the affair — including, infamously, a stained blue dress — and record her conversations with the President.

Clinton famously denied ‘sexual relations with that woman’, then humiliatingly had to admit that he had lied.

He became only the second U.S. president to have impeachment proceedings launched against him, but the Senate acquitted him of lying under oath and obstruction of justice.

Remarkably, his marriage survived. Previously unpopular with voters, Mrs Clinton leapt in the polls as she played the loyal wife.

Miss Lewinsky, meanwhile, became the punchline for a thousand smutty jokes. Ever since, she now claims, she has been saddled with a reputation as the ultimate  office slut. She says she was made a scapegoat by the Clinton camp who labelled her ‘the Unstable Stalker’.

She is clearly still haunted by the scandal. In the Vanity Fair article, she reveals how, overcome by ‘the shame, the scorn and the fear’ that had been ‘thrown’ at her, she contemplated suicide several times in the years following the revelations. Her mother would stay by her bed, night after night, to watch her. 

The Clinton administration demonised her so successfully, she writes, that she has never been able to leave the affair behind. Now 40 and with a masters degree in psychology from the London School of Economics, she still cannot find a decent job because of her notoriety.

‘I wish [the Clintons] no ill,’ she announces at the end of her 4,300-word screed in Vanity Fair. But she cannot possibly wish them well.

The tone of her piece, which is illustrated with a come-hitherish shot of her lounging on a sofa, is supremely self-pitying, even if you can sympathise with at least some of her complaints.

It must have been painful to have watched the Clintons breeze from success to success while she is still seen as the voluptuous vixen who almost brought down a President.

Interestingly, she directs most of her fire not on the man she says ‘took advantage of me’, but on the wife who stood by him. Is this surprising? Not to many  U.S. political observers, especially Republicans, who see her intervention as a blatant attempt to derail Hillary’s bid for the White House.

Hillary Clinton is being widely tipped as a strong candidate to run for president in 2016

The timing is suspicious. Mrs Clinton has a new memoir out next month — the perfect moment, many believe, to announce that she will indeed run in 2016. If she does, her husband, whose electioneering skills are second to none, is expected to be a crucial part of her campaign.

Following Ms Lewinsky’s latest sally, however, the U.S. media are asking about Monica, not Hillary.

Miss Lewinsky says she refused numerous interview offers during Mrs Clinton’s 2008 presidential run against Obama, because as a ‘conscientious Democrat’, she feared she would be used to damage the party. Six years on, however, it’s no more Miss Nice Guy.

‘I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past — and other people’s futures,’ she writes. But there’s another reason why she might suddenly have become less sensitive about hurting the Clintons, and Hillary in particular.

As Miss Lewinsky recounts, previously unpublished papers revealed in February that Mrs Clinton had made some choice remarks about her love rival to her best friend, Diane Blair. Although Mrs

Clinton found her husband’s ‘lapse’ with Lewinsky inexcusable, she praised him for ‘trying to manage someone who was clearly a “narcissistic loony toon” ’.

Mrs Clinton also revealed she partly blamed herself for her husband’s philandering because she had been ‘inattentive to his needs’.

Miss Lewinsky writes that Mrs Clinton’s description of her made her ‘bristle’. Worse, she adds, it began to ‘gnaw’ at her that Mrs Clinton had wanted her uncharitable comments to come out, as she had encouraged Diane Blair to keep a record of their chats for posterity.

‘Hillary Clinton wanted it on record that she was lashing out at her husband’s mistress,’ Monica gripes in Vanity Fair. ‘But I find her impulse to blame The Woman — not only me, but herself — troubling.’

Given that Mrs Clinton’s presidential ambitions largely rely on appealing to women voters, accusing her of betraying the sisterhood is about the most politically damaging accusation Miss Lewinsky could have made.

She also takes aim at other women, particularly feminists, whom she had expected to rally to her side as the Washington establishment portrayed her as a husband-stealing flirt, but who failed to do so.

With no one to fight her cause, she claims, she was left to slink off into the shadows. Well, not quite.

Despite her tales of financial woes and endless job rejections, Lewinsky exploited her notoriety effectively. She co-operated with a biography written by Andrew Morton and — trading on her name — started designing expensive knitted handbags. She also appeared in a string of TV shows, including a dating show and a stint as a U.S. correspondent for Channel 5 in Britain.

In 2005, she moved to London to study at the LSE to reinvent herself. The staff and students were ‘wonderful — welcoming and respectful’, she says now.

But moving back to the U.S., she reveals her attempts to carve out a career have been dogged by her notoriety. ‘Because of what potential employers so tactfully referred to as my “history”, I was never “quite right” for the position,’ she writes. Her love life has been similarly blighted. ‘With every man I date, I go through some degree of 1998 whiplash,’ says Lewinsky, who has never married or had children.

As for the Clintons, she sniffs that she ‘understands that what has happened to me and the issue of my future do not matter to them’.

She ‘deeply regrets’ the affair, criticising her lover’s ‘gross, inappropriate behaviour’, but concedes it was a ‘consensual’ relationship.

Many Republicans, keen to find anything that can stop the seemingly unstoppable Clinton juggernaut, had been dredging up the Lewinksy affair long before the Vanity Fair article.

In February, potential Republican White House contender Rand Paul accused the Democrats of hypocrisy for claiming to support women’s rights while exonerating Mr Clinton of his ‘predatory’ behaviour. Some Republicans have cautioned against resorting to dirty tactics, so there is widespread delight that Monica has done it for them.

Has she finally exacted the ultimate revenge?

‘Like many other Americans, I’ve been thinking about Hillary Clinton,’ she muses. ‘What might happen if she does run in 2016?’

One thing’s guaranteed. The Clintons won’t be allowed to forget the biggest blot in their copy-book.
