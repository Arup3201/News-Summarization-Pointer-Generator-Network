President Barack Obama leveled a new round of sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, responding to President Vladimir Putin's refusal to back down from his military interventions in eastern Ukraine.

Obama told reporters at the White House that Russia is 'isolating itself from the international community, setting back decades of genuine process.'

'Russia is once again isolating itself from the international community, setting back decades of progress,' he said minutes later. 'It doesn't have to be this way. This is a choice that Russia and President Putin in particular have made.'

Obama said he doesn't see his administration's several rounds of economic sanctions against Moscow as a new 1980s-style standoff.

'No, it's not a new Cold War,' the president said, responding to a question from CBS News.

'The United States means what it says': Obama spoke on the South Lawn of the White House on Tuesday, announcing new economic sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy in the latest move to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his support for Ukrainian rebels

'Russia continues to support the separatists ... and train them, and arm them,' he said, adding that American satellite surveillance has documented Russian forces launching artillery strikes directly into Ukraine.

'Today is a reminder that the United States means what it says.'

The sanctions include a wide range of targeted moves aimed at banks, defense contractors and Putin 'cronies and oligarchs,' a senior administration official said Tuesday. And 'today we have expanded the list of financial institutions' under sanctions 'to include three additional major Russia-owned banks.'

'There need to be greater costs imposed on Russia,' the official said, in response to 'the flow of heavy weapons and support we've seen from Russia into Ukraine in the last couple of weeks.'

Russia is backing the separatist movement whose soldiers shot down a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet last week. Obama complained that Putin's government has blocked international inspectors from viewing the entirety of the crash scene.

The U.S. president devoted most of his 10 minutes of remarks to underscoring his administration's hope that Putin will buckle under the weight of financial penalties, and withdraw from Ukraine.

'The main tool that we have to influence Russian behavior ... is the impact they're having on its economy,' he said.

Obama dodged a reporter's question, however, about whether the U.S. will step in and arm the Ukrainian government.

'Are you considering lethal aide to Ukraine?' came the question.

'The issue is not the ability of the Ukrainian military to outfight the separatists,' Obama replied.

He also noted a new round of sanctions from the European Union, calculated to emphasize Europe's preference for Ukraine over Putin's Russia.

Standing alone? Russian President Vladimir Putin has maed his nation 'more isolated than at any time since the end of the Cold War,' a senior Obama administration official told reporters on Tuesday

Those sanctions, announced hours before Obama spoke in Washington, include limits on capital market access for Russian state banks, an arms trade embargo and restrictions on the export of sensitive technologies to Russian oil companies â€“ including foreign companies engaged in Russia's petroleum markets.

Obama's announcement came in conjunction with a series of EU sanctions targeting banks, defense contractors and the oil industry in Russia

'It is meant as a strong warning,' a statement from the European Council read: 'Illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country cannot be accepted in 21st century Europe.'

Obama highlighted the degree to which Russia's annexation of the Crimea, and its continued arming of rebels there, has exposed Putin to consequences all across Europe.

'It's hard to avoid the spillover of what's happening in eastern Ukraine from affecting Europeans across the board,' Obama said.

A second senior administration official said after the president boarded Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House that 'the European Union's steps are strong, they are significant, and they represent a new step for Europe .... that we have taken together,'

'That is very similar to what we have done.'

'Russia is not a very good bet right now for international investors,' added a third official.

Asked what the administration expected Putin to do, he rattled off a list of expectations.

'There still is an off-ramp available to Russia and President Putin,' the official told reporters during a conference call.

That would require Moscow to recognize the legitimacy of Ukraine's newly elected government, stop the flow of arms across the Russia-Ukraine border, abandon its troop buildup there, and persuade rebels to enter a diplomatic dialogue.

'We will continue to hold that door open,' he said.
