Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans should not step down over allegations of rape and sexual assault, former chief whip Andrew Mitchell has said.

Mr Mitchell, who quit the cabinet last year amid claims he called police officers 'plebs' - said it would set a 'terrible' precedent.

Tory MP Mr Evans was arrested at his home and questioned by police on Saturday but insists the claims by two young men are 'completely false'.

He made clear through his solicitor that he intended to carry on as Deputy Speaker while police continue their investigation.

But Speaker John Bercow has agreed he
be excused from duties chairing the week-long debate on the Queen's 
Speech, which begins on Wednesday.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond 
questioned yesterday whether Mr Evans could continue as Deputy Speaker 
while he was under investigation.

'I stick rigidly to the view that we 
should treat people as innocent until they are proven guilty but it is 
quite difficult to carry out a sensitive and high profile role while 
being under this kind of scrutiny,' he told the BBC.

But Mr Mitchell told BBC Radio 4's 
Today: 'If he were to resign now we would be in a terrible position 
where every public office holder would be open to blackmail and false 
stories in the media, triggering their resignation.'

'Anyone who is caught up in the sort 
of intensive media storm which Nigel has faced, and which I and my 
family faced, obviously is in a very difficult position to carry out 
their job.

'But in this particular circumstance I
am in no doubt that Nigel Evans should not resign and that he will be 
able to fulfil his duties as required by the Speaker.

'We have three deputy speakers in the House of Commons so if necessary there can be a degree of burden sharing.

'He has not been charged, he has not 
been found guilty, and we do still live in a country where you are 
supposed to be innocent until proven guilty.'

Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was spoken to about 'inappropriate sexual behaviour' four years ago, according to reports

He said he did not believe there was 
any truth in the allegations against a friend and colleague of 20 years 
whom he had known 'in good times and in bad times'.

Mr Mitchell admits swearing at 
officers who stopped him cycling out of the main Downing Street gates 
last September but denies using the highly-charged insult.

Asked why he resigned despite denying
the claims, Mr Mitchell said: 'In my circumstances, this matter had 
dragged on for 28 days.

'I took the view that I could no 
longer discharge the duties the Prime Minister had asked me to discharge
and that's why I resigned.'

Mr Evans, the 55-year-old MP for 
Ribble Valley, described his arrest and questioning by police as 'the 
worst 24 hours of my life'.

He had what appeared to be a 
gash on his forehead which aides asked a television make-up artist to 
try to conceal before he made his statement yesterday.

The injury was not evident 
in pictures taken of him on Thursday night when he was out in Soho with 
former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik.

'I was interviewed by the police 
concerning two complaints, one of which dates back four years, made by 
two people who are well known to each other and until Saturday, I 
regarded as friends,' he said.

'The complaints are completely false 
and I cannot understand why they have been made, especially as I have 
continued to socialise with one as recently as last week.

'I appreciate the way the police have
handled this in such a sensitive manner and I would like to thank my 
colleagues, friends and members of the public who have expressed their 
support and, like me, a sense of incredulity at these events.'

It has since been reported that Mr Evans 
was interviewed by senior Conservatives in 2009 over an allegation of 
'inappropriate sexual behaviour'.

Transport
Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who was then opposition chief whip, is 
believed to have interviewed Evans after an accusation that he made an unwanted advance on a man he had been drinking with.

The Daily Telegraph, citing a friend of 
Mr Evans, reported that the MP explained the matter was a 
'misunderstanding'.

The friend said there was no 'verbal warning' but 
added that Mr Evans may have been given some 'friendly advice'.

The
matter was not reported to police and it is understood the man who 
accused Mr Evans of inappropriate conduct continued to associate with 
him.

Downing Street refused to comment on whether David Cameron knew of the allegations at the time.

News
of Saturday’s arrest at the constituency home of the popular MP for the
Ribble Valley in Lancashire came as a huge shock to colleagues at 
Westminster, many of whom spoke out in his support.

Instead
of Mr Evans chairing any Commons debates on the Queen’s Speech in the 
absence of Mr Bercow, that role will be performed by his fellow 
deputies, Dawn Primarolo and Lindsay Hoyle, Commons sources said.

The decision means Mr Evans is unlikely to take the Speaker’s 
chair for at least a fortnight – giving all sides time to consider 
whether he can continue to carry out his duties while under police 
investigation.

He has owned the £250,000 two-bedroom terrace cottage – 
which has a small House of Commons portcullis on its wooden nameplate – 
for 15 years.

Officers have been searching his London and Lancashire homes as well as his car, a white 
Saab convertible parked in the village.

He was released on bail on 
Saturday night, shortly afterwards saying on Facebook: ‘Thanks for the 
amazing overwhelming support at this difficult time.’

Mr Evans – said to be ‘very shaken up’ by his arrest – refused to answer questions except answering ‘ok’ when asked how he felt.

In
2009 the Daily Mail told how the MP had spoken of ‘shocking’ failures 
at Singleton Hospital in Swansea following the death of his 86-year-old 
mother from the superbug C.diff.

In addition to online support, Mr Evans was backed by family, neighbours and political colleagues.

His 49-year-old sister, Louise Collins, who took over their father’s newsagent’s business in Swansea after his death, said: ‘The family love him to death and we’re 100 per cent behind him.’

His local Conservative Association released a statement saying: ‘In our democracy everyone accused is innocent until proven guilty and therefore unless Nigel chooses himself to cease to be our MP or the electorate vote him out or justice system intervenes, we expect him to continue as normal to fulfil his duties in representing the people of the Ribble Valley.’

Brian Binley, Tory MP for Northampton South and a friend of Mr Evans, said he had been ‘deeply disturbed and shocked’ at his arrest.

‘I know him to be caring, compassionate, and in no way would he inflict himself violently on any other person,’ he said.

Leicestershire Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who was accused of a sex assault two years ago only for police to drop their inquiries six days later, also said Mr Evans should continue.

Earlier, however, Mr Hammond told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show that while he stuck ‘rigidly’ to the principle of innocent until proven guilty, ‘it is quite difficult to carry out a sensitive and high-profile role while being under this kind of scrutiny’.

Tory sources stressed that, as Deputy Speaker, Mr Evans does not technically take the Conservative whip, so the question of it being withdrawn does not arise.

The high-profile arrest will fuel the debate over whether anonymity should be granted to those suspected but not charged over sex offences.

Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair told Sky News that while it was ‘a real problem, I think the names have to be given’.

Lancashire Police said Mr Evans, who has represented the constituency since 1992, had been arrested on suspicion of raping one man and sexually assaulting another between July 2009 and March 2013.

Following several hours of questioning by detectives at Preston Police Station, he was released on bail to June 19.

Mr Evans was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010.

Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was 'tired of living a lie'.

He told The Mail on Sunday that he had also been threatened with exposure by political opponents.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
