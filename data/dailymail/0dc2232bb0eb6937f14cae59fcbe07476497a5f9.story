The smugglers' retreat that inspired Daphne du Maurier's bestselling tale of murderous wreckers has sold for a staggering £2million.

The Jamaica Inn pub, situated on Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, was bought by businessman Allen Jackson for more than 40 times what the current owners paid for it four decades ago.

The Grade II-listed property formed the backdrop for du Maurier's famous 1936 novel, which was later adapted into the 1939 Hitchcock film and a 1983 television drama starring Jane Seymour.

And the story will be returning to screens later this year when 
Downton Abbey's Jessica Brown Findlay takes the lead role in a new 
BBC adaptation.

The isolated 17-bedroom Inn was bought by current owners John and Wendy Watts for just £46,000 in 1973.

They spent 41 years running the pub, inviting fans of du Maurier to stay in one of its 17 bedrooms, which are named 
after characters from the novel.

However, the couple decided to sell the property and its 6.5-acre - via Christie & Co - this year to allow them to retire.

New owner: Businessman Allen Jackson made an offer on the Grade II-listed Inn within an hour of viewing it

Interior: The businessman, who has bought both the Inn and its accompany smugglers' museum, said he was 'delighted' by the purchase. Above, the interior of the Inn, which was built as a coaching house in 1750

Mr Jackson, from Surrey, made an offer within an hour of viewing it  - beating off competition from as far afield as the US, Canada and Australia.

The businessman, who has bought both the Inn and its accompany smugglers' museum, said he was 'delighted' by the purchase.

'With the BBC adaptation airing around Easter, I believe it is a very timely acquisition,' he said.

'I am delighted to have acquired Jamaica Inn and intend to breathe new life into this fantastic and historic location.'

The Grade II Listed inn was built as a coaching house in 1750 and inspired du Maurier when she found refuge there after getting lost while riding in thick fog.

The local rector entertained her with ghost stories and tales of smuggling and he later became the inspiration for her fictional character, the Vicar of Altarnun.

Du Maurier's subsequent novel is considered to be a Gothic classic,
 telling the tale of a ruthless, bloody gang who lured ships onto the 
rocks on the Cornish coastline before murdering the survivors and 
robbing them.

It has been enjoyed by several generations through the many screen adaptations of the tale.

The Inn itself has a similarly eerie history. Built in 1750, it was used as a coaching inn by weary travellers using the turnpike between Launceston and Bodmin.

Travellers would stay a night at the remote and isolated inn after having made the treacherous journey across the moor.

The building is also reputed to be one of the most haunted places in Britain.

Earlier this year, Mr Watts, 76, said: 'My wife and I have stayed there on a few occasions in the old part of the building and at night the room would go very cold. That's all I am going to say - it is totally unexplainable.

'We also get a lot of visitors who have had funny experiences. The old generator house [which has since been redeveloped] was definitely a very eerie spot and most people didn't want to go in there.'

However, despite its spooky past, the pub still attracts droves of du Maurier fans each year.

Its smugglers' museum, featuring du Maurier's original writing desk, features a 15-strong team that increases to 30 staff in peak season.

Speaking about its success, Mr Watts described it as 'probably the finest genuine collection of smuggling artefacts in the 
country'.

Jamaica Inn is the story of young Mary Yellan who is forced to move in with her Aunt Patience after her mother dies.

When
 Mary arrives in Launceston she discovers her aunt living under the rule
 of her husband, Joss Merlyn, who is the crooked keeper of Jamaica Inn.

Mary
 quickly falls into a life of crime, joining the group of wreckers led 
by Joss and his brother, Jem, who run ships aground and murder sailors 
to steal their loot.

Against her better judgement she develops feelings for Jem, a penny thief whose crimes are less severe than his older brother's.

After
 several attempts to expose Joss as the criminal he is, Mary discovers 
him alongside her Aunt Patience who have been stabbed to death.

She
 returns to her native Helford, but flees one day after seeing Jem walking across the moors with all his possessions.
