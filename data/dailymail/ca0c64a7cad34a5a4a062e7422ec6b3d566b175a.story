Drinking plenty of water would usually be seen as a healthy habit – and many of us could probably do with upping our daily intake.

But for one young mother it is an addiction which drives her to down a staggering 44 pints a day.

Sasha Kennedy, 26, carries large bottles of water with her wherever she goes and rarely sleeps for more than an hour a night without waking for a drink.

She is forced to go to the toilet up 
to 40 times every day and has even quit jobs over the lack of quality 
water in her workplaces, she says. Yesterday, Miss Kennedy, from 
Southend-on-Sea, Essex, revealed she consumes 5.5 gallons of water over 
24 hours.

Though her daily water intake far 
exceeds the maximum 3.5 pints recommended by experts, she says she has 
been checked by doctors and has no health problems as a result.

Psychogenic
 polydipsia is an uncommon clinical disorder characterized by excessive 
water-drinking in the absence of a physiologic stimulus to drink.

It is commonly, although not always, encountered in patients with psychiatric disorders.

Complications
 can include incontinence as well as renal and congestive heart failure.
 Patients can also suffer from potentially fatal water intoxication when
 the balance of electrolytes in the brain is disrupted.

The diagnosis is one of exclusion. Management includes fluid restriction along with behavioural therapy and certain drugs.

Miss Kennedy said: ‘If I feel my 
mouth start to get dry I have to get my next fix of water – it’s all I 
can focus on. People never really think anyone can drink that much until
 they get to know me – then they just cannot believe their eyes.

‘I feel thirsty pretty much all the time and always have to be sipping water – it’s an addictive habit.

‘The most sleep I’ve ever had is about one hour and 15 minutes, because I am getting up to drink or nip to the loo.’

Miss Kennedy, who is a full-time 
mother to Reggie, two, and Fraser, one, developed her habit when she was
 just two years old. She began nagging her parents for more water, which
 prompted them to take her to the doctors.

But medical experts confirmed there was nothing wrong with her.

By the age of six she drank so much water that her mother started leaving a jug of water by her bed each night.

She started taking a bottle of water 
to school each day and would stay close to the water fountain at break 
time while the other children went out to play. By 13 she was already drinking up to 26 pints each day.

‘By that stage my parents had got rid
 of the jug by my bed at night and replaced it with a five-litre (nine 
pint) plastic container,’ she said.

‘When I was 16 and left school I started work in a shoe shop stockroom and everyone began to notice how much I drank. They ended up moving the water cooler next to my desk.’

Miss Kennedy quit her next job, at a carpet firm in Dartford, Kent, because the quality of their tap water was not good enough.

By her early 20s she was downing 35 
pints a day and her addiction peaked when she began working from home 
for a telecoms company in 2007. She now drinks between 31 and 44 pints 
each day.

Experts yesterday said Miss Kennedy’s
 condition was rare, with the average adult drinking little more than 
200ml of water per day. Dr Emma Derbyshire, a nutrition 
consultant, said: ‘Over-hydrating with any fluid is possible and in 
extreme cases it can be dangerous, but this is very rare.’
