Barry Hills has revealed he will close down his late son John’s racing business next month but continue to train a small string of horses for owner Sheik Hamdan Al Maktoum.

Hills came out of retirement to be at the helm of the Lambourn stable after John died of cancer on June 1.

Friday’s Newbury victory of Nafaqa, one of 26 horses he trains for Sheik Hamdan, was Hills’s 11th since taking control.

Revealed: Barry Hills is to close down his late son John's racing business next month but continue training

He had been working with his youngest son Charlie, who succeeded him at Faringdon Place stables, also in Lambourn.

‘I can keep going as long as I want and eventually there would be room for a replacement,’ said Hills.

‘It will do Charlie good, too. I’ve been making a nuisance of myself with him. I wouldn’t be easy to have around.’

A tilt at either Sandown’s Solario Stakes or the Acomb Stakes at York’s Ebor meeting is on the agenda for Nafaqa, half-length winner from Marshall Jennings under jockey Paul Hanagan.

The 8-11 favourite had made an eye-catching debut when fourth in the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot after a very slow start.
