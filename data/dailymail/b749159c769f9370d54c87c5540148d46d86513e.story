Why was anyone surprised? Cristiano Ronaldo ended talk of a scoring drought by netting his 58th Champions League goal for Real Madrid in 58 games for the club to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Roberto di Matteo’s Schalke.

It was the 12th consecutive away game in the Champions League that Ronaldo had scored in and he set up Marcelo in the second half to put the game beyond the Germans.

Ronaldo had not scored in his last three games. He hadn’t gone four games without scoring for four years but he rose to head past Schalke’s 19-year-old keeper Timon Wellenreuther to put Real Madrid in-front in the first half.

The holders were not happy about being forced to wear pink – the last time they played in their garish third kit they lost 4-2 to Real Sociedad and had wanted to play in their all-black second strip only for Uefa to deem it clashed with Schalke's blue and white. They needn’t have worried – this was more 'back to the fuschia' than the 'shocking in pink' display they delivered in Anoeta in August.

The did make a nervous start however with Toni Kroos, English referee Martin Atkinson’s first booking and Lucas Silva – the 22-year-old Brazilian making his debut in midfield – almost following him with a foul on the edge of the area that Klass-Jan Huntelaar smashed into the wall.

Schalke were soaking up Madrid pressure and creating chances themselves with Dennis Aogo blasting over after finding more time and space than Carlo Ancelotti would have been happy with down the Real Madrid right. The left wing-back also caught Ronaldo and left him temporarily hobbling but the Portuguese got back into his stride and put Real Madrid in front.

Right back Dani Carvajal got forward down the right and sent a hanging cross to the edge of the Schalke six-yard-box. The Germans had three central defenders on the pitch but none of them tracked Ronaldo who climbed to nod past Wellenreuther.

Benzema could have made it two from Kroos’ pass but was denied by the teenage goalkeeper but things were now going downhill fast for Schalke. Huntelaar limped off after a shin-pad to shin-pad crunch with Raphael Varane and Kevin Prince Boateng was booked meaning he will miss the second leg next month.

Ronaldo very nearly doubled his tally but Wellenreuther saved well from a fiercely struck free-kick and although Ancelotti could be seen urging Karim Benzema to track back he must have been happy with a first half performance that ended with Gareth Bale getting into the game with a jinking run down the Madrid right. 

This was never going to be the 6-1 victory that Madrid chalked up last season with Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo all scoring twice last season but the European Champions were in control.

Isco released Ronaldo at the start of the second half and he almost found Benzema as Real Madrid looked to kill the game off. Bale then crossed from the right but Wellenreuther gathered comfortably. Schalke looked short of ideas and not too upset with a 1-0 first leg reverse. Real knew another goal would all but put them through.

Bale was not helping them in that cause failing to pick out Ronaldo in one counter-attack. There was a supportive round of applause from the Portuguese when Bale’s pass was played behind him. Ronaldo was then almost gifted another free-header in the Schalke area but Wellenreuther cut out the cross before it reached him unmarked at the back post. Isco was then flicked through by Bale but he sent his shot just over.

And Madrid almost paid for the missed opportunities to double their lead when Felix Platte rattled Casillas’ bar from Boateng’s cross after Marcelo had been caught in possession.

That was a wake-up call for Madrid to get the second in spectacular style. Ronaldo dribbled his way infield from the Madrid left and Marcelo’s right-foot rocket nestled in the top corner to put the match and tie beyond Di Matteo’s team.

The Brazilian raced away to celebrate with his coach Ancelotti. The Italian had been whistled by the mindless minority in Madrid’s last game but he remains on course to guide Real in to the quarter-finals.

They will have to improve to win the competition but they had comfortably enough to beat the fourth best team in the Bundesliga. Casillas’ 150th Champions League appearance had been largely without incident and Ronaldo had got back among the goals. The Balon d’Or’s ‘barren’ spell is now behind him and Real had even buried the curse of that pink kit.
