If the Steffon Armitage deal to Bath does go through, I would applaud the RFU and Stuart Lancaster for any part they may have had in making this happen.

It sends out a strong message that, in this World Cup season, England will not compromise. There will be no ‘what-ifs’ or excuses. England will do everything they can to win the World Cup. If you do that, and ultimately there is disappointment because it doesn’t quite work out, there can be no regrets.

Everybody needs to be available and the coaches must select from maximum strength.

As this story has unfolded I found it totally unacceptable that potentially we could have been facing a situation in which Armitage was not only unavailable for England selection but could even line up against them for France in a big World Cup game!

The truth is Armitage may not get picked as an England starter — he is going to find it very tough — but a player of his quality has to be in the squad pushing hard for selection, challenging all the others.

The dynamic in a squad when you have two or three class players pushing for every spot is brilliant, everybody has to step up and find a new level. It also means that coaches and those selecting the team have to really sharpen their pencils and be ruthless.

The England back row is very competitive, make no mistake, and is packed with a number of versatile players, not least the skipper Chris Robshaw. He can play right across the back row while Armitage can play openside or No 8, which is where Toulon often field him. All sorts of options could come into play.

Armitage is expected to play in Europe this weekend, meaning he will not move to Bath

Having made the effort to get Armitage back home I see no point in hanging around and insisting on some sort of probation period. This is not the time for niceties.

If the deal goes through by the weekend, I would put him straight into the senior squad which is announced next Wednesday and make sure he gets a certain amount of game time this autumn.

Equally, if Sam Burgess had been available I would have thrown him straight into the action this autumn. Although that can’t happen now I would get him involved with the squad as soon as he is permitted to travel back home after his surgery.

I can only see one downside to Armitage’s return and it is more a matter of long-term principle than a short-term problem. There is absolutely no doubt that he has improved massively since he was last capped by England in 2010 when he was with playing with London Irish. He was a raw talent then, a more than useful player, but he didn’t look like a genuine England back-rower to me.

We should never forget that playing for Toulon has been the making of Armitage. They have found a way of getting him fitter, developing his game and integrating him into the team, so much so that he became the European Cup player of the season.

That is one of the reasons I remain convinced that the ‘free market’ should still be allowed. I see no reason why a player looking to better himself shouldn’t ply his trade an hour away in France and still be eligible for England.

There will also be a certain amount of dislocation if and when Armitage returns, and that’s probably not ideal. But to make such a move shows that his motivation to contest for a World Cup spot must be very high.
