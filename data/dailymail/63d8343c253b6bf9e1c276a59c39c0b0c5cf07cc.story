A 25-year-old man has been arrested after a mother found him naked in her 10-year-old son's bed. 

Ernest Reed Johnson was picked up by police in Tampa Bay, Florida, on Sunday morning after officers responded to a burglary call. 

They arrived at the residence at 4am when the distressed woman told him she had found the intruder lying next to her boy.

When he was spotted he jumped out of the window he had broken in through, WPTV reported. 

Johnson managed to escape and was on the run for just over four hours.

However the police K9 unit managed to track him down nearby, and he was detained.

Johnson was then booked into jail and charged with lewd and lascivious molestation, burglary of an occupied dwelling and possession of burglary tools.

He does not appear to be on any sex offender's register.  

The 25-year-old managed to escape through the window he used to break in, but was tracked down in the area (pictured) by the K9 unit four hours later
