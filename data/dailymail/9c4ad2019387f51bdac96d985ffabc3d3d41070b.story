Britain's Kyle Edmund had to settle for the runners-up spot at the Yokohama Challenger but is still set to break into the world's top 200 for the first time.

The 19-year-old, long regarded as Britain's most promising young male player, reached his first final on the second-tier Challenger Tour thanks to back-to-back victories over higher-ranked players.

But Australian John Millman proved too strong in the final, winning 6-4, 6-4 in Japan.

Britain's Kyle Edmund is set to break into the world's top 200 for the first time 

It is the second consecutive weekend Millman has beaten a British player in a Challenger final, with James Ward losing in Australia seven days ago.

Edmund may well have been spurred on by the rapid progress of 20-year-old Liam Broady, who reached his first Challenger final last month to climb into the top 200.

Edmund's success has come since he ended his coaching partnership with former British number one Greg Rusedski last month.

Having made encouraging progress under Lawn Tennis Association coach Colin Beecher, Edmund turned to Rusedski in April but the association proved to be short-lived.

The split came after a succession of first-round defeats, with Edmund continuing to work with his other coach, James Trotman.

LTA chief executive Michael Downey had been a strong supporter of the Edmund-Rusedski partnership, and he said: 'Kyle wanted Greg and Greg wanted an opportunity. I'll wear this one. But we are optimistic of where Kyle is heading.'

Rusedski's television and other commitments meant he could only spend a certain number of weeks working with Edmund during a very important time in his development.

Director of player development Bob Brett said: 'I spoke with Greg and I said he needed to have a project. But there has to be a real commitment to it and unfortunately he wasn't ready to make that commitment, although he did free up extra weeks.'
