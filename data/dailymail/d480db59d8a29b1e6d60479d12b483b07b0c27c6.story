Tottenham Hotspur's Benjamin Stambouli has lavished praise on his team-mates after they booked their place in the Capital One Cup semi-final with a 4-0 win over Newcastle at White Hart Lane.

Goals have been few and far between for Mauricio Pochettino's men of late - they have found the net just twice in their last four matches in all competitions.

However, despite making several changes, goals from Nabil Bentaleb, Nacer Chadli, Harry Kane and Roberto Soldado ensured Spurs secured an emphatic victory over the in-form Magpies.

Stambouli liked what he saw on Wednesday night, and was equally pleased with helping his side secure a cleansheet.

'I think it was a perfect performance. We were focused on our opponents, we had that willingness to score and it came naturally,' Stambouli told BBC Sport.

'It is never easy even if you are winning 2-0, but we focused on our defending and then our attackers took their chances.

Spurs have not enjoyed themselves on their own turf this season, having picked up more points away from White Hart Lane (14) than at home (10).

Fans have made their feelings clear on several occasions this season, but Stambouli is hoping that cup success will win over the doubters on the terraces. 

'All the club and all the fans are very happy,' Stambouli added.

'We will do our best to win this trophy.'

Spurs will take on League One side Sheffield United in January's semi-final two-legged encounter, with a place against Liverpool or Chelsea up for grabs in the final.
