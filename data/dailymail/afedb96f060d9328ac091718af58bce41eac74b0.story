The Taliban are just 'days away' of recapturing a region in Afghanistan which claimed the lives of 150 British and US troops during the eight-year conflict. 

Rebels are surrounding the towns of Musa Qala, Nawzad and Sangin in the Helmand Province as the Taliban seeks to reclaim areas cleared by NATO troops.

The Afghan National Security Force is attempting to hold onto the area but are engaged in fierce fighting with the Taliban.

The Taliban want to recapture the towns of Nawzad, Musa Qala and Sangin in Helmand Province 

British troops regularly patrolled Musa Qala after the Taliban were forced to retreat from the area 

According to The Times, heavy fighting has taken place in the region as the Taliban seeks to regain control of its main opium production area. 

In Musa Qala, the Taliban are only 50 metres from the town centre, while over in Sangin, pro-government forces control only 30 per cent of the town. 

Afghan officials have claimed that the Taliban has launched 800 attacks around Sangin in the past month. 

Sayed Mohammad, head of the local district council in Musa Qala said: 'From 15 days, fighting is going on. The reason is the government is weak and doesn't have heavy weapons. The police chief and district chief are still in place, but we are not sure for how long.' 

Abdul Bari Barakzai added: 'The fighting is still going on in three districts. Afghan security forces are on the defensive. They are very tired. If one district fall, the other will also fall.'

Earlier this month the Taliban targeted the Afghan intelligence service in a co-ordinated truck-bomb attack

Afghan President, Hamid Karzai, today condemned a US air strike which killed 14 people including civilians 

The Afghan government is planning to reinforce Musa Qala with additional troops. They have been responsible for security in the area since last summer. 

NATO is still providing air support in the region although this is controversial with local officials. 

An airstrike in Asadabad, eastern Afghanistan killed 14 and injured 13 other - including civilians. 

Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the airstrike, claiming US aircraft were responsible for the attack. 

The governor of Kunar province Shuja ul-Mulk Jalala said two children were among the dead. 

Afghan and US troops called in the jets after they came under sustained attack by Taliban elements.

US military spokesman, Major Paul Greenberg, said a coalition precision strike killed one armed insurgent on Tuesday in Kunar's Dangam district.

'A second operation was conducted on the same night in Narang District, Kunar Province, and we are currently looking into the circumstances of that operation.'

Afghan officials said it was often difficult to determine whether those killed in an airstrike were Taliban or civilians, particularly in areas dominated by insurgents. 

The Afghan government is considering signing a legal agreement allowing some NATO troops to remain in the country after combat operations end in December to train and advise local troops.
