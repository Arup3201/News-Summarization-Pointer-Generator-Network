The sister of a detective shot dead by Harry Roberts has hit out at the decision to release the killer, insisting he should have been given the death penalty.

Grace Anstey, 84, says she can never forget the day she learnt her brother, Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, had been gunned down alongside two of his colleagues in 1966.

She slammed the decision to release Roberts from Littlehey Prison, Cambridgeshire, on Monday after 48 years behind bars, saying 'life should mean life' for the 78-year-old.

Mrs Anstey's younger brother was 30 years old and serving with the Metropolitan Police when he and two other officers were shot dead in Shepherds Bush in the shooting dubbed the 'Massacre of Braybrook Street'.

The policeman, who had grown up in Dartmouth, Devon, died after Roberts shot him in the head with a Luger pistol.

Great grandmother Mrs Anstey, who has since emigrated to Sydney, Australia with her husband Fred in 1955, said she learned of his 'shocking' release on Monday when a British relative rang her.

She said: 'It's all just very difficult. I am just sad. I feel life should be life.

'I know Harry Roberts is an old man now, but so would my brother have been. They were the same age.

'It's so upsetting but what can you do? I hope he doesn't misbehave again. It's unfortunate that capital punishment was abolished just the year before.'

Mrs Anstey says her brother (pictured, back row right, during his childhood) would now be roughly the same age as 78-year-old Roberts if he had not been murdered

When Roberts was sentenced to life in prison, the judge, Mr Justice Glyn-Jones, recommended that he serve at least 30 years before becoming eligible for parole.

He commented that the killings were 'the most heinous crime to have been committed in this country for a generation or more' but couldn't pass the death sentence because it had been abolished a year earlier.

Roberts, who had two accomplices, John Duddy and John Witney, has expressed 'regret' and insists he is no longer a danger to the public.

Amid great secrecy, he was taken from prison to a bail hostel in the south of England, where he will be assessed pending an expected move to warden-controlled accommodation.

Reports suggest the killer has changed his name, possibly by deed poll, to avoid being identified by fellow residents.

Witney was released in 1991 but died eight years later when he was beaten with a hammer and strangled in Bristol, while Duddy died in Parkhurst prison in 1981.
