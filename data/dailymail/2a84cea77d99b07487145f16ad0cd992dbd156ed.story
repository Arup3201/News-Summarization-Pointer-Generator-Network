A stockpile of nearly 30-tonnes of confiscated ivory is being incinerated in Hong Kong as officials crack down on an illegal wildlife trade devastating Africa's elephant population.

The huge haul is being hacked into pieces ahead of being destroyed with authorities sending out a message that they are ready to get tough on those involved in the smuggling industry.

A metric tonne of elephant tusks, carved ivory figurines and bracelets were burned in a rotary kiln in the first batch to go.

The stockpile includes a number of ivory figurines and bracelets which will also be incinerated as Hong Kong gets tough on the illegal trade

The illegal wildlife trade is said to be devastating the African elephant population with poachers killing 35,000 a year

But destroying the stockpile, which is one of the world's biggest, is expected to take until mid-2015.

The fine dark gray ash left after incineration will be mixed with cement and lime and dumped in a landfill.

About 1.6 tonnes of ivory will be kept for educational or scientific purposes.

Ivory can fetch up to $2,400 a kilogram in China, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare.

 same organisation estimates poachers kill 35,000 elephants a year for 
their tusks, risking the animal's extinction in the wild.

The destruction follows similar initiatives in the past year by Belgium, France, China, the U.S. and the Philippines.

Hong Kong's stockpile has bulged as customs agents have intercepted a series of big shipments of smuggled ivory in recent years.

The busts highlight the former British colony's role as a transshipment hub for ivory shipped from Africa to mainland China, where demand is growing because of rising incomes.

It comes just days after 33 elephants were killed in a remote park in Congo.

Ten were killed in Garamba National Park, according to African Parks, a conservation group that manages the park along with Congolese authorities.

Park rangers killed three poachers in a weekend gun battle in Garamba, in Congo's northeastern corner near South Sudan.
