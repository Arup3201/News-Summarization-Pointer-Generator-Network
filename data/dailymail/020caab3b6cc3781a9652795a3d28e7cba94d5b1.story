Teleporting yourself to see friends and family in far-flung locations is the stuff of science fiction, but in the near future you will at least be able to visit them virtually.

Communication experts have devised a system that combines 360° cameras with virtual reality headsets to make video calls fully immersive.

When a call is made, a person will be virtually transported to the recipient’s location and can see everything they can see - as if they were in the same room.

The 360° video calling with Virtual Reality (VR) headsets system will be on display at next week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and more details will be released then.

Created by Summit Tech, its system uses the Giroptic 360cam and an Oculus Rift headset.

When a call is received, it is routed through the recipient’s 360cam and footage from the camera is then streamed to the caller’s Oculus Rift.

This makes it possible to have an immersive view of the place they are calling, as well as share the VR experience with others in real-time.

It has been specifically designed to connect Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Video over LTE (ViLTE) calls - both of which require an internet connection to work.

In addition to connecting with virtual reality headsets, the 360° video calls can also be streamed as a Video Share session on Android, iOS and Microsoft smartphones or downloadable apps for tablets and PCs.

The technology has been tested, but will not become mainstream until a consumer version of the Oculus Rift is released. 

And at this point the release date isn’t known.

Giroptic’s waterproof 360cam is expected to launch this spring and sends real-time content to a connected phone.

It can be pre-ordered now for $499 (£323) and in addition to being used in Summit Tech's setup, the camera comes with a light bulb adapter to double up as a security camera, or can rival GoPro as an action camera.  

MailOnline will be demoing Summit Tech's virtual reality technology at next week’s conference.

Last week, Facebook's Chris Cox said the social network has started building virtual reality versions of its apps and the company's head of product imagines a world where it could become as common as sharing a post.

Facebook owns Oculus Rift and its plans could mean that in addition to checking-in and sharing holiday snaps on the site, users will able to virtually transport friends to wherever they are.
