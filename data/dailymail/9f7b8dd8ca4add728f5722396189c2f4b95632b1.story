The after-effects of the recession could lead to the pilfering of post-it notes and other office supplies, according to a study

The after-effects of the recession could lead to the pilfering of post-it notes and stealing of staplers, according to a new study.

While people like to think they will stick to their ethical principles no matter what, when they feel financially deprived, they are more likely to relax their moral standards and commit minor transgressions, scientists claim.

Canadian researchers found that faced with financial losses suffered as a result of the last recession, some people resorted to workplace sabotage and stole supplies and equipment.

Scientists from the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, said people are more likely to judge other deprived moral offenders who do the same more leniently.

Nina Mažar, an associate professor of marketing at the university and one of the lead researchers of the study, said: 'We found that most respondents did not think financial deprivation would lead them to behave immorally.

'Yet, once they actually experienced financial deprivation, they were more likely to loosen their ethical principles.'

The study, to be published in the journal Organisational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes, found public policies that entrench financial inequalities, such as regressive taxation plans or tax cuts for the wealthy, could also lead to more cheating inside and outside the office.

And those who interpret or enforce policies or regulations as part of their work - in corporations, law enforcement, or the judicial system - need to be mindful of the deprivation effect too, the study said.

Temporary upsets in a person's own financial position could lead them to go easier on others demonstrating unethical behaviour while under financial stress, according to the paper.

There are many ways people assess their financial health, but research has found one of the strongest influences is comparing oneself to other people.

A sense of financial deprivation can happen when people simply feel financially inferior to their peers.

The findings are based on a series of experiments that studied people's views about dishonest behaviour and how they behaved once they were induced to feel financially-deprived themselves.

Workplace theft is common: Employees may see their own and other colleagues' financial positions as inferior and unfair, relative to the companies and executives they work for, leading to workplace stealing

The effects were observed both in experiments where people actually experienced financial loss and in those where they were merely made to feel financially-deprived, relative to others.

The effects were lessened however, when people saw that acting unethically would be unfair, would not improve their financial situation, or when they accepted that their financial position was deserved.

Perceptions of fairness were key to participants' decisions to act honestly or dishonestly, said Professor Mažar.

The research suggests that one reason why workplace theft is so common, is because employees may see their own,and other colleagues' financial positions as inferior and unfair, relative to the companies and executives they work for.

This is despite the fact that people predicted that financial hardship would not lead them to act immorally
