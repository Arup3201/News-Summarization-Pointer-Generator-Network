A man sliced his roommate’s nose off after the pair argued about their shared space, a court heard today.

Marc Capre, 34, allegedly stabbed Davide Loffredo eight times in the back after he went across to the defendant’s side of the room to plug in a hair dryer.

Mr Loffredo, 23, left a trail of blood as he frantically tried to flee with Capre continuing to knife him as he followed him into the street outside their home in Murchison Road, Leyton, London, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

The incident was sparked by a disagreement over where the alleged victim could plug in his hairdryer (file picture)

Mr Loffredo then fell to the ground and was stabbed again by Capre, it was said.

Horrified onlookers who rushed to help Mr Loffredo saw the tip of his nose was hanging off after the April 27 attack, jurors heard.

Mr Loffredo was taken to hospital by air ambulance and treated for life threatening injuries, including a collapsed lung and slashed artery.

He was finally discharged from hospital on May 14.

Prosecutor Bill McGivern said Capre and his roommate struggled to get on, prompting Mr Loffredo to make a complaint to their letting agents.

'The crown say it was later on that day when he complained about him that the incident took place,’ Mr McGivern told the jury.

'The room had a dividing curtain, which the crown say was something the defendant had set up because he wanted a degree of privacy.

'On that day, Mr Loffredo had gone to have a shower in a separate part of the house.

'Mr Loffredo went to the defendant’s side of the room to use a plug to dry his hair.'

Moments later, Capre produced a large kitchen knife and 'went for' his roommate, Mr McGivern said.

'He stabbed him in the shoulder. The Crown say Mr Loffredo’s response was to move to the door to try and escape.

'He went along the landing and started making his way downstairs.

'The defendant followed him, stabbing at him.'

Murchison Road, Leytonsone, east London, where the incident took place. Passers-by came to Mr Loffredo's assistance as he bled from multiple wounds

He added: 'At one point, he slashed at his face, partly cutting off the top of his nose.

'Mr Loffredo fled down the stairs. As he went down, the defendant was following him and stabbing at him.

'As he was being chased, they were further stabbings or attempts to stab him.

'The Crown say he was fleeing for his life at that stage.'

Passers-by came to Mr Loffredo’s assistance and one of them noticed the tip of his nose was hanging off, Mr McGivern added.

A number of wounds on his back were bleeding quite substantially, the court heard.

Capre later handed himself into a nearby police station, throwing the knife on the ground outside.

The blade was bent from the force it had been used to stab Mr Loffredo, jurors were told.

Capre, who was covered in blood, insisted it was roommate who had started the fight and claimed he was simply trying to defend himself and he panicked.

'The Crown say that far from being self-defence, even if it were, it was clearly excessive, the defendant was the aggressor,’ Mr McGivern added.

'He armed himself with a knife and went for Mr Loffredo.

'Not content with stabbing him in the room, he chased him while he was in the street.

'He stabbed him with considerable force, a man who, at that stage, was injured and lying defenceless on the ground.

'The Crown say that, at that stage, he was intent on killing him.

'While it’s true he did call the police and go to the station, the Crown say he had very little choice.

He lost his temper, didn’t get on with his roommate, snapped and went for him.'

Capre, who is aided by a French interpreter, denies attempted murder and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

The trial continues.
