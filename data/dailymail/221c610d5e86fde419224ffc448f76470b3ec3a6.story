Thefts from war memorials have more than doubled since last year, with vandals now targeting them at the rate of one every two days.

Campaigners warn action must be taken to prevent the alarming rise, as scores of monuments across the country are being stripped of metal plaques and statues, before being sold as scrap.

Built to preserve the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, there are an estimated 100,000 memorials in Britain.

But ahead of Remembrance Sunday, the War Memorials Trust, which works to conserve the nation’s monuments, is warning that growing numbers are being targeted by unscrupulous criminals.

Frances Moreton, the trust’s director, described the increase in thefts as ‘alarming’ and called for greater vigilance.

‘There has been a noticeable increase in the amount of thefts reported to us in recent weeks. At the end of last year, we were getting reports of one incident a week. But in the past six weeks it has been one every other day, which is a noticeable increase,’ she said.

‘It is always shocking when people steal from a memorial. We have now lost the last veterans of the First World War, and they have moved from living history to historical touchstones.

‘These plaques are often the last personal link with some of the fallen. If they are lost, and their names forgotten, then it dilutes everything Remembrance Sunday stands for.’

The trust believe the recent rise in thefts is being fuelled by the soaring price of scrap metal, and growing awareness of the issue, which has resulted in more people contacting them, but also alerting crooks to an easy source of plunder.

The contempt for Britain’s heroes was highlighted last week, when a bronze statue of a Second World War soldier was stolen from the garrison town of Tidworth in Wiltshire.

Support: The Duchess of Cornwall is a Patron of the War Memorials Trust, which has launched a campaign to protect every memorial before the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War

The trust, which is supported by the Duchess of Cornwall, has now launched a campaign - called In Memorian 2014 - to protect every memorial before the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War.

A Clarence House spokesperson said: ‘The Duchess of Cornwall has been Patron of the War Memorial Trust since 2007 and continues to support the trust’s important work.’

The aim is to mark every one of Britain’s war monuments with SmartWater – an invisible chemical marker which can be seen under UV light - in a bid to deter thefts.

The trust will also issue hand-held UV lights to all of Britain’s scrap dealers to encourage them to check if metal have been illegally taken from memorials.

Sir Keith Povey, chairman of the SmartWater Foundation, said: ‘As the centenary of the First World War approaches, In Memoriam 2014 encourages communities to reconnect with their local war memorials and remember the sacrifice that so many people made for their country.’ 

The theft of metal is a growing problem across Britain, with the cost to the economy estimated at £770 million per year. Soaring prices for metals like copper, which has seen a threefold increase in value since 2009, has meant railway lines, phone lines, as well as war memorials and statues, have been targeted by metal thieves.

Currently, all scrap metal dealers are obliged to do is register with the local authority.

There are also growing calls for a tighter laws on the sale of scrap metal to halt the plunder of memorials, and tougher sentences for those who wilfully desecrate them.

Patrick Mercer, a Tory MP and former Army officer, said: ‘Of course it is a disgrace. These are national sacred monuments and their destruction goes far beyond a normal crime.

‘Scrap metal thefts are a big problem. Ministers should look at further regulation around scrap-metal dealing, but the best possible solution is crime prevention measures and swingeing sentences for those found guilty of these sorts of crime.’
