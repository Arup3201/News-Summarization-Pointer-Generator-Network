David Moyes was not given proper backing at Manchester United according to his former player Kevin Kilbane. 

New boss Louis van Gaal has been given a whopping £160m to spend this summer, bringing in Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind and Radamel Falcao. 

But Kilbane criticised the lack of time and money afforded Moyes, saying those players would still have been signed if the Scot was still at the club according to the Daily Star Sunday.  

Kevin Kilbane, who played under David Moyes at Everton, doesn't think his former boss was given a fair crack of the whip at Man United

Moyes' disastrous 10-month spell at Old Trafford was brought to an end in April 

He said: 'If David was still the manager, United would have made exactly the same signings this summer. 

'I don't imagine for one minute that Louis van Gaal has gone out and targeted Luke Shaw. That deal was done. The Ander Herrera deal was done. 

'Van Gaal could have said no to those players but he is obviously happy to have them. If David was still there, he would have got the exact same players.'

The former Republic of Ireland international played under Moyes at Everton for three seasons and was also his team-mate at Preston.

Moyes' woeful 10-month spell at Old Trafford came to an abrupt end in April but Kilbane is adamant his ex-boss would have been a success if he were afforded two key commodities - time and money. 

The only transfers the former Scot made during his time at Man United were Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini.  

Kilbane added: 'For me, David was not given two things at United - time and money. I'm convinced that if he had been given two or three seasons he would have been a success.

'He needed time - two or three years minimum - to get his side the way he would have wanted.'
