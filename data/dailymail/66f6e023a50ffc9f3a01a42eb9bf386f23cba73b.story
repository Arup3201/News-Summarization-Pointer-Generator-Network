A French official was shot dead at the wheel of his car by two assailants on a motorbike shortly after supporting his daughter's bid to become a local politician.

Jean Leccia was killed in the town of Aleria, on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, police have said.

The 53-year-old government services director was killed yesterday as he returned from a different town where his daughter was bidding for a seat on the local council.

The crime scene was inspected by a local prosecutor after police cordoned off the area, AFP have reported.

The killing was the second suspected murder on the island this year, according to reports, while last year saw 17 murders and 14 attempted murders.

In September 2012, MailOnline reported how three men were killed by suspected gangsters as they travelled up a mountain road in Corsica.

The shooting was in a hamlet called Pont-de-Castirla, close to the village of Castirla, in north Corsica.

A local judicial source said that the car was hit by 'a volley of snipers' bullets' which killed everybody.

At least one of the victims was 'known to the police' with a suspected 'settling of accounts' being the motive for the attack, said the same source.

Corsica is reportedly notorious for its criminal gangs, with bandits regularly attacking each other with guns and bombs.
