An authentic Gaucho cowboy has staked his claim, being named the ‘World’s Most Talented’ after performing some incredibly controlled yoga with a horse.

Martin Tatta from San Antonio de Areco, Argentina, is revered for his spiritual connection to horses through the art of yoga and showcased his unique talent for the TV series.

Featured at his ranch at the start of the clip, the 32-year-old explains what it is exactly that he does with one of the show’s presenters David Brain.

And goes into brief detail about what Indian breaking in involves.

He says: ‘It’s called Indian breaking in, it takes a lot of time working with the horse on the ground, but I trust animals more than anything.

‘You shouldn’t trust people, but you should trust animals. And as for my wife, sometimes I don’t trust her either.’

After sharing a quick hug with the presenter, Martin introduces him to his family and his mentor Alberto, who took him under his wing when he was aged 14.

Despite this however, Alberto takes little credit for Martin’s unique talent and claims that his ability with horses is something that cannot be taught.

He says: ‘Authentic Gauchos have many customs, he [Martin] learnt some of that stuff, but not this. He learnt this on his own.’

Riding his horse into position to begin the routine, Martin is filmed by David as he slowly stands up on the animal’s back.

Next he lays down on top of the horse and rubs his head against its neck. 

Descending to its knees the animal rolls over onto its side and Martin begins caressing its stomach.

Martin then moves the horse onto its back and after placing his hat on its hoof, gets the animal to point its legs.

Straddling the horse, Martin returns to lay on its stomach and after moving its front legs into place performs an impressive head stand.

David and Alberto look on in amazement as Martin turns the horse back onto its legs before bringing it to the ground once more, jumping up on it, and standing up as the horse ascends.

Martin was taken under the wing of his mentor Alberto when he was just aged 14 and he has been training ever since

Reacting with a laugh of disbelief, David remarks that the performance was incredible.

He says: ‘I have never been more confident that that is going to blow people away. If that horse had taken one step in the wrong way it would have really hurt.’

Martin will represent Argentina against Japan when the programme is broadcast at 9pm on Tuesday April 21.
