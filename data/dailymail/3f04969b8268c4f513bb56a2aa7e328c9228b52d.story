The German automobile club and Europe’s biggest motoring organisation has found itself in a public relations pile-up after its vaunted Car of the Year Award was exposed as a fraud.

ADAC says it is Europe's biggest auto club with more than 18 million members, offering breakdown help, safety tests and many other services to a nation of car enthusiasts.

And last week, it angrily denied reports that voting in a poll of readers of its monthly magazine on Germany's Favorite Car was tampered with.

Germany's AA: ADAC says it is Europe's biggest auto club with more than 18 million members, offering breakdown help, safety tests and many other services to a nation of car enthusiasts

Fraud? The 2014 Car of the Year is the VW Golf which ADAC said received 34,299 votes before it was crowned last Thursday. But the ADAC's head of communications admitted that he inflated the figures by ten times the real amount because only 3,409 people had bothered to vote

But the association has now admitted that its head of communications did indeed inflate the figures by ten times because hardly anyone actually bothered to vote.

'It's a write-off,' judged top-selling 
newspaper Bild, likening the damage to the 111-year-old association's 
image to that of a totalled car.

Michael Ramstetter, head of communications at ADAC until Friday morning, admitted that he was the one who fiddled the figures by ten times the real amount because only 3,409 people had voted.

'We're very sorry': ADAC's chief Karl Obermair, personally humiliated himself after he initially scolded media for reporting doubts about ADAC's vote-counting, apologised today

His confession came after prolonged rumours of vote fixing that were hitherto vigorously denied by the club.

Shortly after being made to walk the plank on Friday Ramstetter said candidly: 'I’ve messed up and cooked the numbers.'

His boss, head of ADAC Karl Obermair who fired him, has ordered a full investigation.

It lays ADAC wide open to claims of kickbacks from car firms to promote their vehicles and a nasty suspicion that the whole competition has been a total fix for the decade it has been running.

'We've got our work cut out for us to repair the tarnished reputation,' said ADAC managing director Karl Obermair, who called Ramstetter's actions 'an inexcusable mistake'.

'We're very sorry,' added Obermair, personally humiliated himself after he initially scolded media for reporting doubts about ADAC's vote-counting.

'This strikes at the very core of our existence. Our goal is to restore our credibility.'

Ramstetter admitted to Munich’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung that the figures were manipulated for 2012 and 2013. 

In 2012 the Audi Q3 SUV received the 
coveted ‘Gelber Engel’ - Yellow Angel - accolade, after the 
organisation’s break-down vans’ colour. 

It won with 330,000 votes - a 
figure dreamed up in Ramstetter’s imagination as ADAC now believes just 
76,000 votes were actually cast.

Another scandal: It is a nightmare reminiscent of 2005 when ADAC was forced to admit fixing a test on the Romanian-built budget car the Dacia when it put out a press release saying the car's wheels were dodgy (pictured: 2012's Dacia Sandero)

‘Credibility
 and trust are our key commodity,' said Herr Obermair, adding that ADAC 
would be apologizing to car producers.

The award was, until last week, one of the most respected automobile market indicators and could
 make or break the reputation of models.

2009 - VW Golf IV

2010 - Mercedes E-Class

2011 - BMW 5 Series

2012 - Audi Q3

2013 - Mercedes A-Class

2014 - VW Golf

It is a nightmare reminiscent of 2005 when ADAC was forced to admit fixing a test on the Romanian-built budget car the Dacia when it put out a press release saying the car’s wheels were dodgy.

The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung received a tip off from a whistleblower that in fact the wheels were purposefully damaged prior to the test to make it perform badly.

Ramstetter was also editor-in-chief of car industry magazine Motorworld and he has lost that post too.

In the land where car is king and top marques like VW, BMW and Mercedes fill the nation’s driveways and autobahns, the fixing of the competition is front page news.

VW, eager to distance itself from any part in the manipulation, has demanded ‘clarification’ about what went on.

But while calling for clarity, a spokesman for the giant concern based at Wolfsburg added; 'We still believe that the Golf is the favourite car of the Germans.’

‘Now a massive crisis of confidence threatens the ADAC, the largest car club in Europe and Germany,' said Manager Magazin Automobile experts voiced concern that if ADAC could fix the votes for a car contest, motorists may have been wrongly informed in other areas over the years.
