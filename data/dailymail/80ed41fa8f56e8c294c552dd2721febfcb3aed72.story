A new mother was left in tears after a Sainsbury's worker told her she 'shouldn't be out of the house with a baby this young' when she took her six-week-old son shopping.

Sainsbury's has apologised to Sabina Latto after a female member of staff made the comment having approached her in the Hedge End store in Hampshire.

The employee also asked Mrs Latto, a 28-year-old teacher, where her son Myles's father was.

It was one of the first times that Mrs Latto had left the house with her son following a lengthy stay in hospital after his birth and she says the incident has 'shattered' her confidence.

In tears: Sabina Latto was devastated when a Sainsbury's employee said that her son Myles, pictured at three weeks old, was too young to be taken out shopping

She said: 'When you have a new baby lots of people approach you and usually it's very kind things like "oh isn't he gorgeous", and initially that's how the conversation started.

'Unfortunately, it took a very sudden turn when she decided to tell me that, basically, I shouldn't be out of the house with a baby this young.

'She asked me what I was thinking "bringing my son to a place like this".'

She added: 'I was absolutely shocked and devastated. I have just had a baby and I was in hospital for a very long time with a very difficult labour.

'It was one of the very first times I left the house since I had him.

'And for an employee to come and say what she said to me, I just burst into tears in the middle of the supermarket.

Apology: The company has launched an investigation following the incident which happened at this Sainsbury's store in Hedge End, Hampshire

'It made it seem like I wasn't looking 
after him properly and that I was neglecting him when all I was doing 
was having a look round the shops.'

Mrs Latto complained while she was in the store and the worker later apologised.

She said: 'It has really shattered my confidence about going out of the house with my son.

'It made it seem like I wasn't looking 
after him properly and that I was neglecting him when all I was doing 
was having a look round the shops.'

'He was six weeks old, not six days. I
 was really enjoying being a mum and now I am afraid to leave the house 
in case anyone else has a go at me.'

Sainsbury's said it is investigating the incident.

A spokesman for the supermarket giant said: 'We are deeply concerned by this incident and apologise unreservedly to Mrs Latto for the distress this has caused her.

'We are investigating what happened and the store manager would like to meet Mrs Latto to apologise in person and welcome her back in store.'
