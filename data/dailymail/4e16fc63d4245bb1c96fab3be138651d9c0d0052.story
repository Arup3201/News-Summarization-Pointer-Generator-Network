A Ugandan nanny who was caught on video kicking and stomping on a 18-month-old when the little girl was sick while eating dinner has pleaded guilty to torture.

Jolly Tumuhirwe now faces up to 15 years in prison and a fine of roughly $400 (£260), after being charged with the torture of a child in her care.

The 22-year-old nanny was caught attacking  Aneela Kamanzi when the child's father Eric Kamanzi, noticed that his daughter was bruised and limping.

The assault happened after the child, seen being shoved off the couch in her family home in Uganda, was sick while being fed a meal by her nanny Jolly Tumuhirwe

Instead of confronting the nanny, Mr Kamanzi  viewed the security cameras that he had installed in the family home in Nakawa after becoming concerned about his daughter's safety.

The father watched in horror as the footage showed Tumuhirwe dragging the child onto the floor before beating her with a torch, and then kicking and standing on the toddler.

The attack began after the little girl vomited while the nanny was feeding her a meal. 

According to the BBC, Mr Kamanzi broke down when the nanny told the court that she was sorry for what she had done and begged for forgiveness.

The reporter said Tumuhirwe was not represented by a lawyer in court, despite the fact that one of Uganda's leading advocates offered his services. The magistrate denied the request saying the lawyer had not formally notified the court.

Mr Kamanzi is reported to have beaten Tumuhirwe, who had been working for the family for three months at the time, 'to a pulp' after watching the video.

The nanny later reported the assault to police and Mr Kamanzi was arrested after admitting he had attacked her.

But after showing police the security tapes of the assault on Aneela, the charges against the father, who works for an NGO in Kampala, were dropped.

The distressing video of the child being beaten caused outrage when it was posted online in Uganda, and has since been shared thousands of times on social media.

Police had issued a statement saying the charge of torture would be amended to attempted murder, but the directorate of public prosecutions was quoted in local media stating that the charge remained torture under the Anti-Torture Act.

The prosecution asked the court for an adjournment of two days so that she could gather more facts on the case. 

The case will return to court on Wednesday when it is expected that the magistrate will make his final ruling and sentence Tumuhirwe.
