A British flower containing a lethal poison which can lead to serious illness or even death has been found near to a National Trust lighthouse - despite once being extinct.

Dougie Holden, assistant ranger at the lighthouse, found the lone corn-cockle flower in the grounds of Souter Lighthouse in Whitburn, Sunderland.

But the Royal Horticultural Society has now warned curious members of the public to neither pick up nor touch the 'very rare' flower, due to the noxious poison and toxins that it contains.

Experts say every part of the plant is filled with glycoside githagin and agrostemnic acid that could lead to severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, weakness, slow breathing and, in extreme cases, even death.

The sighting comes after the flower, which goes by the real name agrostemma githago, was thought to have disappeared from the UK due to modern farming methods.

Mr Holden said: 'It is highly toxic and shouldn’t be touched. I have never seen one before. I am delighted.

'If it disperses, we might get a small population of them which would be great. It will be interesting to see if we get more growing in the future.'

Guy Barter, chief advisor at the Royal Horticultural Society, said the plant is barely seen in the UK and is very dangerous.

He said: 'This is indeed a very rare flower and was once extinct in Britain. The seed may have found its way into a wildflower mix and blown from a garden but they do lay dormant for years.

'It‘s more likely the soil has been disturbed and the flower popped up.

'They are poisonous and harmful - but as long as you wash your hands thoroughly you should be okay. But I certainly wouldn’t recommend eating one.'

The corn-cockle, a pink or purple flower, originates from other parts of Europe and is believed to have been brought into England by Iron Age farmers.

At one time, most fields would have been filled with the poisonous flower, but modern agricultural methods and weed-killers all-but wiped it out.

It was also a very common weed in the 19th century.

The plant was used for generations in folk medicine and even receives a mention in Shakespeare’s Coriolanus.

It can grow up to three feet tall and is covered with fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation if touched.

Its poison was discovered centuries ago, when doctors thought it could have medicinal properties.

They used it to experiment on patients and animals.

In the summer, the plant produces pink or purple flowers with black lines on the petals. They can grow in various places such as fields, roadsides, railway lines and wasteland.
