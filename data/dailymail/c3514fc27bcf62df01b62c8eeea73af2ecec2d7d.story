In her last moments before embarking on a 15-month prison sentence for bankruptcy fraud, Teresa Giudice savored a $1.95 hot egg sandwich in a diner near the penitentiary.

The Real Housewives of New Jersey star spent her last free hour at Elmer's Diner in Danbury in the early hours of Monday morning, where she spent most of the time saying goodbye to friends and checking her cell phone, according to TMZ.  

At midnight, Giudice's attorney James J Leonard Jr picked her up at her lavish mansion to drive her to the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut

A last look: She also enjoyed some precious time on her cell phone before going to her daughter's party

It was a quick pit stop for the Real Housewives star after arriving early to her daughter's party

On her final day of freedom she went to church service and then squeezed in an early 14th birthday celebration for her daughter Gia. 

For Gia's party - two days before her actual birthday - they had 'cake and a celebration,' sources told Us Weekly. 

Teresa then made the lonely trip, leaving her husband Giuseppe 'Joe' Giudice at home with their four daughters.

He will care for them until Teresa's release and then he will begin his own 41-month sentence for similar charges.

Mr Leonard said the 41-year-old reality star was not tearful and instead was 'very upbeat and very positive - she was anxious to get it started.'

Explaining her decision to surrender early rather than at the usual time of 7am, he said: 'She wanted to spare her family and not have a spectacle.' 

The Atlantic City-based attorney told MailOnline her early arrival was pre-planned and the staff at the prison were all very 'polite and cordial.'

He said Teresa took in $200 and a folder of legal documents.

'I gave her rosary beads and a necklace of Saint Christopher and Saint Teresa,' he added.

Mr Leonard said the last thing his client said to him was, 'Tell everybody I'll be fine.'

He explained a first visit for immediate family is this weekend and Joe will be allowed to visit.

Hours after his wife left the family home, husband Joe was seen driving out to take their daughters to school

A BOP spokesman confirmed that she surrendered early this Monday.

On Monday morning Joe was pictured driving out of the family home in New Jersey to take their daughters to school.

The photos caused a buzz on social media as in October Joe  pleaded guilty in state court to unlawful use of identification in a case involving a bogus driver's license.

His 18-month sentence will run concurrent with his federal sentence. MailOnline has contacted his lawyer for a response. 

On Monday morning his mother was also seen driving out the home a few hours later. 

On Sunday Teresa attended mass with her family at the Sacred Hearth Church in New Jersey.

The reality star smiled at her four bundled-up daughters - Gia, 13; Gabriella, 10; Milania, 8; and Audriana, 5.

Teresa is now serving time in the same Connecticut penitentiary where Piper Herman set her memoir Orange Is the New Black and Lauryn Hill did three months for tax evasion in 2013.

People reports that the raven-haired socialite's first moments will involve a strip search and a 'squat and cough' to see if she is hiding anything.

The former Celebrity Apprentice contestant will have to pay for up to 300 minutes a month of precious evening phone time.

On Saturday Teresa Giudice was seen leaving a post office near her home Towaco, New Jersey with one of her young daughters

High-maintenance Teresa went into the prison with $200 - here is a list of the items that she can buy on the Commissary List which may make her feel a bit more at home, including hair dye, three-minute miracle hair care,  pink hair rollers and Dove soap bars

Food that is available to buy from the Commissary List at the prison includes: Hummus,  Albacore tuna, Honey Roasted Peanuts,  Deli meat, Party Mix and Vanilla Chai Tea

According to TMZ, she will have to curb her extravagant spending habits due to the $320/month max allowance for the FCI Danbury store.

High-maintenance Teresa went into the prison with just $200, but items available on the Commissary List which may make her feel a bit more at home, include hair dye, three-minute miracle hair care, pink hair rollers and Dove soap bars.

The food on sale includes hummus, honey roasted peanuts, party mix and vanilla chai tea. 

Teresa told Bravo co-star Dina Manzo during a bizarre resolutions-themed Haute Hostess video for Glam.com that she plans to cut back on carbohydrates as her New Year's resolution.

But according to Radar Online, her resolution may be tricky to uphold on a prison diet. 

Breakfast is a fresh orange, hot oatmeal, three slices of bread, a margarine pat, two packages of jelly and two cups of skim milk.

When lunch is served Teresa will be tucking into beans and franks, potatoes, two mustard packets, three slices of bread, two margarine pats, a fresh apple and a drink.

And dinner will be a fish filet, tomato sauce, white rice, lima beans, two tartar sauce packets, three slices of bread, two margarine packets, a fresh apple, and again another drink. 

Meanwhile Teresa will only be allowed 12 visits per month with her family, and she'll likely have to work in the prison factory.

Wake-up is at 6am and Giudice will report to her prison-assigned job from 8am-3pm.

On Saturday, her teenage daughter tweeted 'can't sleep, to much stuff on my mind,' along with a nervous face and gun emojis. 

On New Year's Day, Gia shared a snap with her mother captioned: 'Happy New Years with my best friend!! @Teresa_Giudice.'

Giudice's last public event was watching her eldest perform with her girl-group 3KT at Iplay America in Freehold.

The New York Times best-selling author has been spending her final days before surrender with her princesses - at a hockey game and a ski trip to Crystal Springs Resort. 

'My family is probably one of the strongest families I know,' her daughter Gia - who's shopping around a reality show - told Access Hollywood in November.

'So we'll get through this. It's gonna be fine. And when it's over, we're gonna be better than ever.'

The Real Housewives of New Jersey star has told daughters Gia and Gabriella about the family's legal woes, but she's reportedly keeping her incarceration a secret from her youngest girls. 

'She told [Milania and Audriana] she is going to jail to work on a book about jail,' a source told Radar Online. 

'Teresa and Joe feel that they are too young to fully comprehend what is going on.'

They pleaded guilty last year to hiding assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitting phony loan applications to get some $5 million in mortgages and construction loans.

Joe  also pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes totaling more than $200,000.

At the Giudices' sentencing in October, U.S. District Judge Esther Salas criticized the couple for not disclosing all their assets as required under their plea agreement, calling it 'the same pattern of obstruction, concealment and manipulation as they showed in the bankruptcy case.'

Still, Salas sentenced Teresa to a sentence below the range sought by the U.S. attorney's office and staggered her sentence with her husband's so they wouldn't be in prison at the same time and unable to care for their four daughters.

Joe is not an American citizen, and he faces an immigration hearing when he completes his sentence and is expected to be deported.

His attorney has said Giudice came to the U.S. as an infant and did not know he was not an American citizen until he was an adult. 

Last month, Teresa Giudice sued former attorney James Kridel, whose firm handled the couple's bankruptcy case, alleging legal malpractice and negligence.

Reached by phone last week, Kridel called the lawsuit 'ridiculous' and denied the claims.

'We did what we were supposed to do,' he said. 'We can only rely on the facts that were provided to us. I don't wish her any ill will, but I would have preferred a 'thank you' rather than a lawsuit.'
