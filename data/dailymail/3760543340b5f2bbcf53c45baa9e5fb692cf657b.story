Most people take photos and video when they go on their travels, but they perhaps don't go to the lengths of Rafa and Noelia.

The globetrotting pair travelled around 9,000 miles from Alaska to Ushuaia - the southernmost city in Argentina - filming themselves dancing in each of the 15 countries they visited. 

The hilarious montage shows the Spanish couple doing their bizarre dance moves in renowned destinations such as Machu Picchu in Peru, the Grand Canyon in the USA and the Andes mountain range in South America.

Rafa and Noelia are seen visiting countries such as the USA, Canada, Cuba, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama and Ecuador during their trip.

The smiling couple enjoy some of the most beautiful sites of the American continent in a range of different locations and environments.

The music played throughout the montage is the song Tafi Maradi by Kevin MacLeod.

Other notable locations which the couple dance beside include the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California and Banff National Park, in the Rocky Mountains, Canada.

Rafa and Noelia dance exuberantly for a number of seconds on stunning beaches, in lakes, on mountains, beside glaciers, on desert like-terrain, in canyons on a bridge and even on a flooded road as a young boy passes them on a makeshift boat.

The couple are seen holding the hands of a Peruvian child outside a number of huts made from straw in Amantani which is an island on the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca

Rafa and Noelia are dressed in t-shirts and shorts in some destinations such as Moab in the USA and Machu Picchu in Peru, while in others like La Cocha in Colombia they are dressed in rain protective clothing and wellington boots.

In Colombia during one segment the adventurous duo are seen covered in mud.
