Following the news Facebook has become the latest firm to enter the drone market, researchers in the UK have successfully created and tested a low-cost craft - built entirely using a 3D printer.

Engineers at University of Sheffield developed the prototype 1.5m-wide unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a cheap, common technique that builds objects using layers of plastic.  

Drones are traditionally built by large manufacturers, due to the cost and complexity involved, and this breakthrough could make the crafts more common place, and even disposable.

Engineers at Sheffield University have developed a prototype unmanned 1.5m-wide drone, pictured, using a cheap, common 3D printing technique that builds objects using layers of plastic. The craft has already completed a test flight as a glider, pictured

FDM printers use two kinds 
of materials - the first is called the ‘modelling material’ and is what 
the object is made of.

While a second, ‘supporting material’ acts as a scaffolding to support the object during the printing process. 

The plastic is heated using the printing heads and a controlled heating chamber.

During printing, the machine takes designs from a computer drawing and recreates it using layers of the modelling material.

As
 each layer is printed, it bonds to the previous one.

In between each 
layer, the modelling heads switch to support heads, which lay down the 
second material.

This support material can then be washed, or snapped, off the model.

FDM is slower than other printing methods, including selective laser sintering (SLS), which uses lasers to fused particles together.

However, by not using lasers, it makes the process much cheaper.

The UAV completed a test flight as a glider, flown by researchers from the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, earlier this week.

The manufacturing cost of the drone has not yet been released, but its researchers have said that it is significantly lower than those of large drone-dedicated companies.

In theory it would be possible to build models 
similar to the drone at home, on 3D printers such as Maplin's 
£700 Kelleman K8200 model.

Engineers at the university are now developing an electric fan propulsion system that will make the drone easier to control.

They then plan to develop the craft so it can be guided by GPS or camera technology, controlled by an operator wearing first person-view goggles.

Sheffield's drone was created for a research project looking at 3D printing of complex designs.

It was built using a technique called fused deposition modelling (FDM), and is made of a polymer called thermoplastic.

FDM is slower than other printing 
methods, including selective laser sintering (SLS), which uses lasers to
 fused particles together.

However, by not using lasers, it makes
 the FDM process much cheaper - although the actual costs depend on the 
materials used, the size of the craft and the printer used.

Additive manufacture development engineer Mark Cocking said: 'By understanding the capability of the FDM process and associated software, we were able to manipulate the design to contain a number of unique features as well as preventing build deformation.

All parts required for the airframe can be combined onto a single build within the Fortus 900 machine, taking less than 24 hours with ABS-M30 material.'

Thermoplastics work out at approximately £5.50 ($9) per 2kg bag, although prices vary.

Low production costs might lead to the printing of 3D unmanned aircraft that could be disposable and sent on one-way flights for delivery, search or reconnaissance purposes, said the engineers.

Dr Garth Nicholson, who led the project, pictured, said the team is working to add an electric fan propulsion to the drone, pictured. It also plans to develop the craft so it can be guided by GPS or camera technology, controlled by an operator wearing first person-view goggles

The craft, pictured, designed by Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMC) was built using a 3D printing technique called fused deposition modelling (FDM). Engineers said the design could form the basis of cheap, and potentially disposable crafts built within 24 hours

FDM printers use two kinds of 
materials. The first is called the ‘modelling material’ and is what the 
object is ultimately made of once complete.

While a second, ‘supporting material’ acts as a scaffolding to support the object during the printing process.

The engineers said the polymer craft could be built and deployed in remote situations, potentially within as little as 24 hours.

The Sheffield UAV is made up of nine parts printed separately that are snapped together. It weighs less than 2kg (4.4lb) and is made from thermoplastic.

The engineers are currently looking at ways to use nylon as the printing material, in place of plastic, which would make the UAV 60 per cent stronger, without increasing its weight.

Dr Garth Nicholson who led the project said: ‘Following successful flight testing, we are working to incorporate blended winglets and twin ducted fan propulsion.

‘We are also investigating full on-board data logging of flight parameters, autonomous operation by GPS, and control by surface morphing technology.

‘Concepts for novel ducted fan designs are also being investigated.’

Mark Zuckerberg revealed yesterday that Facebook is similarly working on drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries.

He
 has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to 'the next 3
 billion people' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar 
power that can keep drones flying for months at a time.

Amazon is also working on developing drones to deliver goods to its customers.
