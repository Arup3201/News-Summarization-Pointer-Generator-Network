A hapless thief who stole a £50 fish tank from a pet store was caught when he returned to the same shop to buy goldfish to put in it.

Nigel Ball, 52, wrote his name and address on a form when he bought the goldfish from Pets at Home on Westgate Retail Park, Wakefield, West Yorks.

Magistrates at Wakefield heard when staff asked what type of fish tank Ball pointed to an unusually shaped tank similar to the one he had stolen.

Police were alerted and Ball was arrested.

Prosecutor, Rory Byrne said Ball, of Wakefield, stole the hexagonal tank from the store just after 5pm on May 29 and carried it home for more than a mile.

Mr Byrne said Ball told police: 'I wanted to buy some goldfish, but I had to fill out a form with my details on it. That’s what got me.'

Store staff alerted police who found the stolen tank at Ball’s home in Walnut Avenue, 

Ball admitted theft. Magistrates adjourned sentencing for reports.
