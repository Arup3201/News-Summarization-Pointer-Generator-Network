Rangers defender Darren McGregor is determined to catch Hearts - because he does not want his Ibrox legacy to be a failed promotion bid.

The Light Blues trail the Scottish Championship-leading Jambos by 15 points, meaning they may have to negotiate a potentially tricky route through the play-offs if they are to regain their top-flight spot.

Having lost to play-off rivals Hibs - who stunned caretaker boss Kenny McDowall's side with a 4-0 hammering - and Queen of the South last month, there is no guarantee Gers would even make it through to the two-legged decider with the side finishing second bottom of the Premiership.

And that is why McGregor says he only has eyes for Hearts.

The former St Mirren defender missed two years of action in Paisley after suffering successive knee ligament injuries - but he claims missing out on promotion would be even more painful.

He said: 'I've had some low points in my career. The two cruciate injuries I had were really difficult times. But this is totally different.

'This club is build on what the former players - guys with a lot of prestige - have done and we want to uphold that. We want to do that justice.

'I certainly don't want to be remembered as the guy who came in and was part of a team not to get promotion back to the Premiership. That would really hurt.'

McGregor has just earned himself a one-year contract extension with the League One champions after clocking up 28 appearances in his debut campaign with the club.

But he is determined not to spend his second season in the second tier.

He added: 'When I first came here I was delighted to be signing for a club as big as Rangers. From where I have been and the injuries I have had I never thought it would be possible to reach the heights that I have.

'The main thing now is to perform. The situation isn't great for us and for me personally, the extra year doesn't mean much unless we get promotion and I am part of a successful Rangers team.

'Automatic promotion is still an option for us. It's still mathematically possible for us to catch Hearts but I can understand from the way it looks that it will be difficult.

'Yeah Hearts have got a big lead but they could go on a bad run or we could go on a good one. Anything can happen in football.

'We need to go again and have confidence in ourselves if we are going to dig ourselves out of this position.

'I'm not going to moan about the external pressures we have here and the demands put on. You know that's what you are going to get when you sign for a club like this.'

Rangers will hope to recover some pride after last Saturday's capital calamity when they face Dumbarton on Saturday.

The team are still adjusting to life without boss Ally McCoist after he was put on garden leave for the rest of his 12 month notice period, while the off-field battle for control continues with Wednesday's news that the Three Bears - Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - had bought out the club's biggest shareholder, Laxey Partners.

But you will not see McGregor using any of that as an excuse for Gers' Leith implosion.

'We know it wasn't acceptable for a club like this to put in a performance like that,' he said. 'We have not got a given right to win games but we were miles short of the standards that have been set throughout this club.

'We could give you a load of excuses but at the end of the day it was not good enough.'

However, a team already short on creative flair has suffered another blow when Lewis Macleod was sold off to Brentford for an undisclosed fee.

McDowall believes he can cope without the Scotland Under-21 midfielder and McGregor has urged those waiting for their chance to grasp it.

He said: 'I really like wee Lewis. He's a talented boy and I wish him all the best.

'I still think we have got strength in depth so as every door closes, it's one opening for other boys. You look at our bench and there are guys there definitely capable of stepping up.'
