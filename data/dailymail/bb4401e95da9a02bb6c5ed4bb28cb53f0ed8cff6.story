More than 9,000 flights in and out of East Coast airports have been canceled or delayed as a major snowstorm packing up to three feet of snow barrels down on the region.

Practically nothing is set to take off or land in New York, Boston and Philadelphia until at least Tuesday evening with the disruption expected to spill into Wednesday.

By Monday evening, about 7,000 U.S. flights through Tuesday had already been scrubbed and 1,700 had been delayed, according to tracking service FlightAware.com.

Most were to or from a band running from Washington through New York to Boston. 

A ground stop had been ordered on incoming flights had been ordered on Monday afternoon at La Guardia and Newark airports and is expected to continue for at least 24 hours.

UNITED AIRLINES

Will not fly Tuesday in New York, Boston or Philadelphia. Spokeswoman Mary Ryan said the airline would limit operations at Newark, New Jersey, and New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy airports on Monday night and cancel all Tuesday flights at those airports.

Callers were also experiencing long times on hold because of the heavy volume.

AMERICAN AIRLINES

Plans to suspend operations late Monday afternoon at LaGuardia, Kennedy, Newark, Boston and Philadelphia and run a 'very limited' schedule in the Northeast on Tuesday, said spokeswoman Andrea Huguely.

DELTA AIR LINES

Has already canceled 960 flights scheduled for Tuesday and expects to shut down at Boston's Logan Airport and offer limited flights at LaGuardia and Kennedy airports, said spokesman Morgan Durrant.

Durrant said Delta might cancel some flights Wednesday morning.

SOUTHWEST

Has already canceled nearly 50 Wednesday flights, said spokesman Brad Hawkins.

Boston's Logan Airport said there would be no flights after 7pm on Monday, and the shutdown could last until late Wednesday. 

Some of those who had landed at JFK reported being stuck on the tarmac for up to four hours. Only one airport at the international hub was left open as officials tried to clear away the snow. 

United Airlines canceled all flights in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. JetBlue, whose flights are largely in the Northeast, has already canceled about a third of its entire schedule. 

About half of all flights out of New York's LaGuardia Airport were called off on Monday, and about 60 per cent of flights heading into the airport were scratched.  

Problems in the Northeast are rippling outward across the country.

In West Palm Beach, Florida, where temperatures are expected to be in the 70s on Monday, about 30 per cent of all flights have been canceled. 

Fort Lauderdale and Orlando are also reporting major cancellations.

Most major airlines are allowing customers whose flights are canceled in the next few days to book new flights without paying a penalty. 

Customers ticketed on flights to dozens of Eastern airports are generally eligible for the allowance, though specific terms vary by airline.

The National Weather Service predicts 2 to 3 feet of snow for a 250-mile stretch of the Northeast, including the New York and Boston areas. Philadelphia should get 14 to 18 inches.

The National Weather Service said the nor'easter would bring heavy snow, powerful winds and widespread coastal flooding starting on Monday and through Tuesday. 

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and state Governor Andrew Cuomo  urged commuters to get out of the path of the oncoming storm - which will set in from noon on Monday - before as much as 24 inches of snow coat city streets. 

Earlier on Monday dozens of flights were canceled ahead of the weather in the Washington-Baltimore region.

Reagan National Airport was the most affected of the region's three major airports, with about 120 canceled incoming and outgoing flights, according to the flight tracking service FlightAware. 

At Dulles International Airport, nearly 40 incoming and outgoing flights were canceled, and Baltimore's airport had 45 canceled outgoing and incoming flights. 

Airlines cancel flights before storms arrive to prevent passengers from driving to the airport and getting stranded in the terminal. 

Airlines also want to avoid having their planes stuck at snowed-in airports.

Most major U.S. carriers said they would allow passengers ticketed to, from or through the Northeast on Monday or Tuesday to change their plans without getting hit by a reservation-changing fee, typically $200.

But stranded travelers could still have extra costs. When weather causes delays, airlines have no legal obligation to find a hotel room or provide meals for stranded travelers, 'although they might do so as a courtesy,' said George Hobica, founder of the travel website airfarewatchdog.com. 

He advised travelers to check the terms of the credit card they used to book the trip - some include coverage for hotels and meals when flights are canceled due to weather.
