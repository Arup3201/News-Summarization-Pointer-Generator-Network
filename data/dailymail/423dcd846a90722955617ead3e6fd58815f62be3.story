A stockbroker with a crippling
bone disease who has smoked more than 130,000 joints in his lifetime 
credits the relaxing drug for his long life.

Irvin
Rosenfeld, 60, says he would not be alive if he hadn't been issued with 12 daily government-supplied 
marijuana cigarettes for more than 30 years, for the treatment of the 
rare bone disorder, multiple congenital cartilaginous exostosis.

Mr
Rosenfeld, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is the longest surviving patient to be assigned to the 
federal medical cannabis program, which began during the HIV epidemic in
the 1970s, and is sharing his experience with lawmakers in a push to 
get it legalised.

Patient Irvin Rosenfield, pictured four years ago, campaigns for the legalisation of medical cannabis. He is taking his story to Kentucky lawmakers next week

He
said he was diagnosed with the rare disease, which causes lumpy bone 
formations to grow along lengths of existing bone causing significant 
pain, at age 10.

After numerous operations and unsuccessful treatments, he discovered in 1971 that smoking a joint helped relieve his pain.

Mr
Rosenfeld was one of a small number of lucky patients to be signed up 
to be studied as part of a 'Compassionate Investigational New Drug' 
program with marijuana.

The
Florida resident is now one of only four remaining survivors on the 
program and he is taking his story to law-makers in Kentucky in a the 
latest drive to get the treatment legalised.

He told wlky.com:
'As the longest-surviving federal medical cannabis patient in the 
country, the federal government has been giving me this tin can of 
medical marijuana, 300 marijuana cigarettes for every 25 days, for over 
30 years. So, I'm living proof how well cannabis works as a medicine.'

More than 200 bone tumours had grown, painfully stretching
muscles and veins, and causing dangerous haemhorrage. Since he began 
the treatment, he says he's not needed any other pain treatment and no 
new bone growths have formed.

Colorado
is the first to decriminalise possession of the herb. The state has 
allowed those over 21 to possess an ounce of cannabis legally.

Life saver: Cannabis-therapy, says Irvin Rosenfeld, has saved his life after being assigned to the US federal medical marihuana program in 1982

Twelve
other states are also in the process of considering loosening the laws 
around cannabis possession and use, including Kentucky.

Senator
Perry Clark and members of the group Kentuckians for Medicinal 
Marijuana brought Rosenfeld from Florida to Kentucky for their campaign.

Rosenfeld's
medical history has been studied by the government for the last 30 
years and Mr Clark and the group want him to address senators and 
representatives at the interim joint committee on health and welfare, on
Wednesday, at the capitol annex.

The
IND program with cannabis was closed to new entrants by the George H. 
W. Bush administration, in 1992, due to the growing number so AIDs 
patients and the subsequent demand to be assigned to the program.

From the age of 10, Mr Rosenfeld has suffered with a rare and painful bone disease which causes growths on his bones, like this one pictured

At its peak, the program had thirty active patients.

Mr
Rosenfeld is one of four survivors, and the only one to have the rare 
bone disorder. The other patients who have been treated with cannabis 
since the early 1990s, suffer from multiple sclerosis, glaucoma and 
nail-patella syndrome.

On his website, Mr Rosenfeld says thanks to the program he has had a full life and has achieved a lot.

'I
work in investments for my clients, both conservative and speculative. 
My two major hobbies are playing softball on Sunday mornings with my 
guys, and either sailing at Shake-A-Leg Miami, or teaching disabled 
and/or disadvantaged kids and adults how to sail.

'However,
my major passion in life is trying to get medical cannabis legal for 
all patients. That is why I wrote my book and have this website.

'I have been able to do accomplish all of this, because I have the right medicine,' he says.

Mr
Rosenfeld, who has been married for 35 years, says he strives to 
educate people of the benefits of the drug, which be believes 'should be
allowed to be used under a physician’s care'.
