A teenager has been viciously stabbed to death as he tried to flee a gang of youths.

The victim, named locally as Danny O'Shea, was chased and had his throat slashed outside his mother's front door in Newham, east London last night.

Paramedics fought for 30 minutes to save the 18-year-old's life, but he was pronounced dead at the scene in front of horrified neighbours at 6.50pm.

Killed: Tragic Danny O'Shea was chased for 300 yards and stabbed by a gang before he died outside his mother's front door

Police have yet to establish whether the teen's mother was in at the time when her son was chased 300 yards before the attack outside the house.

Tributes have already started pouring in to a memorial group on Facebook, which has attracted over 500 people.

Friends of Danny O'Shea today said the 18-year-old 'wouldn't hurt a fly'.Danny's family were said to be too 'devastated' to speak about his death.

However a friend, speaking outside the family home, said: 'Danny wouldn't hurt a fly, he was completely harmless. 'His family are devastated.'  

A large patch of dried blood was still clearly visible opposite the groundfloor flat. A door of a neighbour's home had been taken off for forensic testing and replaced.  

Tributes: Hundreds have taken to Facebook to pay tribute to Danny O'Shea, who died from stab wounds

Paramedics tried to revive Danny at the scene, but he was pronounced dead shortly after.  There have been no arrests and police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Piles of flowers covered the drive of the family home, with balloons, a single candle and pictures with tributes including one from his sister reading 'to my darling bro, we love you so much.

'Dan you're one in 1000's millions RIP. Angel forever, love Jessie, Georgie, James, Lauren, Isabella and Phoebe.'  

A steady stream of family and friends visited the family home, many in tears and some carrying flowers.

The teen's grandfather, Michael O'Shea, told The Sunday Mirror: 'He was a wonderful lad. We're all in shock.'

A police spokesman said earlier that next of kin had been informed but formal identification had not yet taken place.
