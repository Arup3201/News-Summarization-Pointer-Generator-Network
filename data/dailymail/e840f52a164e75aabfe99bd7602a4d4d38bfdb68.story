Harry Redknapp resigned as QPR manager on Tuesday - citing his imminent knee operations as the main reason for his departure.

Redknapp leaves the club second bottom of the Premier League after a fruitless foray in the January transfer window.

Rangers only signed West Ham's Mauro Zarate on loan, as they were restricted to make big money moves.

Below, Sportsmail's Nick Harris assesses the club financial plight.

Redknapp says he had a good relationship with QPR owner Tony Fernandes during his time at the club

Harry Redknapp’s last day saw frustrations in the transfer market. Why was that?

Owner Tony Fernandes’ tweet on Monday suggested he he did not want to spend any money. ‘No more cheque book. We have good players. Bought all the players manager asked for in summer.’

But QPR were previously big spenders, no?

Yes, they spent about £71m on transfers fees since 2012 with players such as Christopher Samba, Loic Remy, Jermaine Jenas and Benoit Assou-Ekotto on big wages too. The club made a financial loss of £65m in 2012-13 and their losses last season as they got promoted are expected to be revealed as £40m to £50m, when the club eventually declare them. That announcement hasn’t been made yet as QPR lock legal horns with the Football League.

QPR paid a then club-record £8million to sign Loic Remy from Marseille in January 2013

What’s that all about?

Football League financial fair play rules limit the losses clubs can make in the Championship. QPR’s losses last season were so big it is expected they’ll face a £30m-plus fine from the League. If they get relegated, they’ll have to pay up, or risk being denied entry back into the Championship. They are taking legal advice. 

QPR won Premier League promotion last year but are expected to reveal losses of £40m to £50m
