A luxury London flat has become one of the most expensively to be sold publicly this year after an anonymous buyer forked out a phenomenal £27million for it.

The stunning five-bedroom apartment is in the uber-exclusive One Hyde Park development in Knightsbridge, and has panoramic views over the Royal park.

The flat, which measures 4,200 sq/ft, was sold over the past week to an anonymous buyer for £26.9million - an incredible 165 times the average price achieved in England.

Exclusive: London's One Hyde Park development, where a luxury flat has just been sold for a phenomenal £27million - making it one of the most expensive apartments to be sold publicly in the UK this year

It works out at £6,400 per square foot, putting it among the most expensive in the capital. If the typical new house in England - which is 920sq/ft - achieved this sort of price, buyers would be forking out a whopping £5.9million on a home.

One Hyde Park, which was built as a joint venture between Christian Candy and the former prime minister of Qatar, and interior designed by Candy & Candy, is seen as one of the world’s best apartment blocks.

Completed in 2011, it is made up of 86 residential apartments and a number of exclusive shops including Rolex and McLaren Automotive. There is secure parking in the basement and residents have access to a private spa, gym, swimming pool and cinema.

The £27million apartment was sold following bidding battle between two parties with London estate agent John Taylor sealing the deal.

The formal reception at One Hyde Park: The 4,200 sq/ft flat boasts five bedrooms, all en-suite. The new owner will now have to pay £1.88million to the government in stamp duty, but pay no more than £1,361-a-year in council tax

Even at that whopping price, it is unlikely to even be close to the most expensive sale of a residential property in London this year. Most high-value central London properties change hands in private deals between publicity-shy tycoons.

And the flat is by no means the most expensive in One Hyde Park. In May it was revealed that another apartment in the same development was up for sale with an asking price of £65million - a price only the world's richest could afford.

That flat was also five bedrooms but is almost twice as large, with a floor space of 9,000sq/ft.

The apartment is said to stretch out across the entire floor plate of 'pavilion C', on the 8th floor, enjoying some of the city's finest views from picture windows running the length of the property.

Luxurious:
 The flat is one of the first to make it to the open market, and the 
first time the curious public has been afforded such an 
extensive glimpse inside the property

David Adams, managing director of John
 Taylor, said of the most recent sale: 'It is five bedroom apartment 
with panoramic views of Hyde Park.

'It was the first flat to come up for sale on the park side and is the ultimate address to have in Knightsbridge.

'We
 had two people bidding for it including a local client and it has 
achieved a very reasonable price. It is one of the highest priced 
apartments sold publicly this year.'

The new owner will now have to pay £1.88million to the government in stamp duty, but pay no more than £1,361 year in council tax.

But if they are buying it through a business, they will have to pay £4million in stamp duty with the government charging commercial buyers a staggering 15 per cent.

The huge layout follows research from estate agent Knight Frank which shows Londoners paid £2.02billion in stamp duty for 2012 / 13 year.

This makes up 40 per cent of the whole of mainland Britain and more than the rest of the country - barring the south east - combined.
