It showcases a much more modern style than Downton Abbey fans are used to – at least on the inside.

But there is no denying the aristocratic glamour of Highclere Castle’s new guest lodge.

For the first time in its 221-year history, the sprawling estate where the ITV series is filmed is offering guests the chance to stay the night in London Lodge, the castle’s Georgian Grade II-listed gatehouse.

Visitors to HIghclere Castle in Hampshire, where hit ITV series Downton Abbey is filmed, will soon be able to stay in the estate’s Georgian Grade II-listed gatehouse

The gatehouse features two separate lodges, which are situated either side of the property’s heavy iron gates, and which each accommodate two guests.

With prices starting from £350 ($547) a night, it is being billed as the perfect getaway for Downton Abbey fans wanting to sample first-hand the sumptuous aristocratic lifestyle depicted in the hit drama.

The lodge, is situated at the top of the mile-long driveway which leads to the stately home which has become familiar to millions of ITV viewers.

The accommodation is self-catering and will be available to rent during the spring and summer when Highclere Castle is open to the public.

Highclere’s owners, the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon, have spent two years restoring the gatehouse which was built by the first Earl of Carnarvon in 1793.

It has been left disused for decades, but will now be open from Valentine’s Day next year.

London Lodge is situated to the north of the estate, with paths and tracks taking guests back through the parkland towards Dunsmere Lake, The Temple of Diana and expansive views of the Castle.

The interiors has been ‘sympathetically restored’ and feature wood burning stoves, fully equipped kitchens, double bedrooms, a bathroom and dressing area.

Highclere Castle offers visitors the chance to have weddings at the 5,000 acre estate for £15,000 

Lady Carnarvon recently said: ‘It’s a new step for me. We will welcome people from all over, I expect. Access is going to depend on the time of year. It will be cosy, charming and unique.

‘It’s exciting bringing back to life an old, sad building and again giving it purpose. It is a new departure for us to try short lets and we hope it will amuse people.

‘I hope to suggest some walks around various paths in the estate as well as suggesting local pubs.’

The castle is already immensely popular with visitors, particularly Americans, many of whom visit Britain specially to take in the stunning grounds.

A new step: Lady Carnarvon has opened the doors to the Highclere gatehouse left disused for decades

Currently there is a long waiting list to marry there, with each wedding earning the estate £15,000 ($23,454).

Lady Carnarvon and her husband Geordie were burdened by the high expense of running a stately home before their friend Julian Fellowes wrote the series, with Highclere in mind, for ITV in 2010.

Reports at the time suggested £1.8million ($2.8million) of urgent repairs were needed to keep Highclere going after it had been ravaged by damp and rot. 

At least 50 rooms were uninhabitable and its stone turrets were falling into disrepair.

Lady Carnarvon added: ‘Downton has helped our marketing in an extraordinary way and has meant we have been able to tackle various projects earlier than otherwise because of the increased tours and visitors. And I suspect the effects from Downton will still roll out over the next 20 years.’
