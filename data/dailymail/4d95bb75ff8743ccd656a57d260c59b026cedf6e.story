Scot Gemmill once overheard someone ask Jack Harper if he could speak Spanish. ‘He was born in Spain!’ laughs the Scotland youth coach, highlighting the irony of the 18-year-old’s decision to represent the county of his parents’ birth.

Harper was born in Fuengirola, a holiday town near Malaga, and could have been forgiven for ensconcing himself in La Roja’s fabled youth set-up — it is not like they weren’t interested.

Who could have blamed him? It would arguably have accelerated his technical development, perhaps even burnished his standing at Real Madrid, where he has made impressive progress through their academy. But he didn’t. He chose Scotland.

Mark Wotte says that he sees a lot of similarities between Harper and a young Robin van Persie 

The influence of his patriotic parents, dad John and mum Tracey — from Barrhead — must be acknowledged and it is significant that Harper speaks in a Scottish accent. He returns regularly to visit relatives and has an emotional attachment strong enough to board a plane to Scotland whenever his Madrid contemporaries head to Las Rozas, the Spanish national team’s football factory in Madrid, during international breaks.

As a young teenager, he was around Scotland’s Under-16 Victory Shield squad. As he grew physically, so did the Scottish Football Association’s involvement, spearheaded by Mark Wotte, who visited Madrid to check on his progress. There, he found a player very much part of the Spanish giants’ development plans.

‘It’s not really certain whether Jack is a No 9 or 10,’ explained Wotte, the former SFA performance chief. ‘So Real Madrid told me: “He is a nine-and-a-half. We love him, but he is a strange player.” I had the same situation with Robin van Persie when I was Under-19 coach of Holland. It was difficult to position him. I see a lot of similarities with Jack. They have a similar style of running and body shape, creativity in and around the box, and the awareness to score goals. But there is still a big gap between where Jack is now and Robin.’

Wotte has never been slow to make the van Persie comparison but he is not predicting that Harper’s career will follow the same trajectory as the Dutchman’s, only that there are points of connection, both physically and technically. He is right. Harper is tall — just over 6ft — and has a similarly languid, straight-backed style to van Persie; he is also technically adept and good in the air with a strong tactical awareness. The latter aspect is picked up on by Gemmill, who has worked with Harper in national youth squads and himself moved to Spain for a year to study coaching.

But Wotte does concede that Harper has a long way to go if he is to emulate Van Persie 

‘Because Jack grew up in Spain, he’s always played a continental style of football, where the game is played at a slower pace and there is an emphasis on tactics,’ says Gemmill. ‘That approach is evident all the way through in Spain. From small-sided games, young players are taught to be tactically aware and that everything has a knock-on effect. Being immersed in that way for his whole life has had a big effect on Jack. It’s in his DNA.’

Harper’s football intelligence has shone through in this season’s UEFA Youth League, with goals home and away to FC Basel, another in a 3-2 loss to Liverpool, and two assists, helping Madrid to finish top of their group and ensure a last-16 place. His performances have also reportedly led to interest from Liverpool and Manchester City.

For a flash of his technical ability, a YouTube search for ‘Jack Harper backheel’ brings up his exquisite assist for the Juvenil A side earlier this month.

Scotland fans will have to be patient, though. He has yet to kick a ball in senior football and there remains a yawning chasm between Juvenil A and the Los Blancos first-team squad, though Harper has at least got to mix with world-class talents such as Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale by travelling with them on Champions League trips (the UEFA Youth League schedule tries to mirror its senior equivalent’s fixtures). A progression to Madrid’s reserve team — Castilla — in 2015 would see him work under Zinedine Zidane and Santiago Sanchez in Segunda B. While Madrid are quietly confident Harper has the ability and attitude to go all the way, the next 18 months are crucial.

While Harper is hardly burdened by an inferiority complex, there have been no rumblings of arrogance or impetuosity that often accompany the emergence of a prodigious talent.

‘I would pay him the compliment of saying he is the opposite [of how people might expect a Real Madrid youngster to behave],’ says Gemmill. ‘Often players at big clubs are now allowed to act like that.’

Wotte agrees: ‘He’s a cool guy. He knows he’s not a star yet.’

Yet.
