Gus Poyet is refusing to discuss individual names for fear of missing out on yet more transfer targets.

The Uruguayan is concerned that information is leaking out of the club and will investigate the source of such.

Sunderland are in talks with Inter Milan winger Ricky Alvarez over a loan move and, with defender Valentin Roberge set for a return to France, they will turn to Celtic’s £6million-rated Virgil van Dijk as replacement.

Scared: Poyet says there could be a leak at Sunderland, and is investigating

Oops: Sunderland missed out on Napoli striker Eduardo Vargas, who signed for QPR this week

But Poyet – who lost Napoli striker Eduardo Vargas to QPR last week – remains nervous as the transfer window enters its final weekend.

‘I don’t want to lose any more targets. When you mention a name then someone else gets involved,’ he said.

‘Another club gets involved, the player wants more money and in the end he doesn’t come.’

He went on: ‘In the last week or 10 days we've been very close to things but they didn't happen. It's not good enough if we don't add to the squad.

‘It's about having the right squad to go from here to January and that's the key and we're working on it.

‘We've been through many things, looking at price and, over the next few years, if you'll get money back.’

Meanwhile, Poyet has reacted to news of Jack Colback’s call-up to the England squad. 

The Newcastle midfielder only left Sunderland during the summer, and Poyet said: ‘I think Jack will agree with us that he spent all his career here and he knows how much this football club helped him and built him into the player he is today.

Call-up: Poyet believes that Jack Colback is in the national side '98%' because of Sunderland's influence

‘If he’s in the national team, how much is up to Sunderland and how much up to Newcastle?

‘In my opinion it’s 98 per cent to Sunderland and two per cent to Newcastle. He’ s been there two-and-a-half minutes and he’s in the national team.

‘That’s what he’s done as a player here, not from what he’s done in the last month and a half.’
