Engineers from McLaren and Ferrari are used to going head-to-head on the Formula One race track in order to give drivers the best chance of taking poll position.

But the two racing thoroughbreds are now competing in bobsleigh and skeleton events at the Winter Olympics too as they have both built cutting-edge equipment for athletes representing their home countries – Great Britain and Italy.

McLaren Applied Technologies applied the same technologies used in the F1 world to improve the aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity of the sleighs, which will give the British team a competitive edge at the Games.

The Team GB bobsleigh consists of a main hull, a frame, a front and rear axle and two sets of runners.

The hull, also known as a cowling, is constructed of fibreglass and made of two separate sections. The hull is mounted on four runners that each must be made of a single solid piece of steel.

No plating or coating is allowed and it is not permitted to warm up runners or use any substance that improves sliding.

At the start of the race, the temperature difference between the runners and the reference runner, which is exposed to the open air for one hour before the start of the competition, must be no greater than plus or minus four degrees Celsius.

A bob may have a cowled front end but must be open at the rear. Push bars protrude from the hull at the start of a race. Those for the second and third man in the four man event must be retractable.

Each bobsleigh has a brake that can only be applied at the finish. Braking during the race means automatic disqualification.

Dr Caroline Hargrove, Director of Performance at McLaren Applied Technologies, which is based in Woking, Surrey, told MailOnline that the building of the sleds is about making sure they are designed and made as well as possible to achieve little gains rather than a revolutionary new design.

This is because the rules governing which materials are used and the components of the sled are strictly controlled by the Winter Olympics body and any incremental improvements are top secret.

‘In essence we have made both sleds work better and have made them more adaptable - rather than necessarily having radically altered the shape or design of particular components,’ Dr Hargrove said.

The company has been involved in the 
design of the equipment from the Canadian Olympics and has gathered vast
 amounts of data as well as helping the athletes have input into the 
design so they can use it easily.

The pressure is on for the sleds to perform well as this year’s British team contains FIBT Skeleton World Cup leader Lizzy Yarnold, who topped the standings in both runs of the Women's Skeleton heats yesterday.

Unlike in Formula One, skeleton sleds and bobsleighs need to be heavy so that they gain speed downhill, but at the same time they must also be light enough for athletes to manoeuvre. There is a sweet spot that leads to optimal performance that also complies with strict regulations.

‘Ferrari have built the bobsleigh for the
 Italian team so, as you expect, this has given the team at McLaren an 
added incentive to produce the goods for Team GB,’ a spokesman for the 
company said.

Lizzy Yarnold (pictured) was the fastest in the field during the heats of the Women's Skeleton on day six of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. McLaren said that Team GB athletes are the only ones to use a sled that is completely tailor made for them. Before, they used one size of sled for men and women

To engineer the perfect sleds, experts at McLaren first collected lots of data by fitting test sleds with a range of sensors to understand their strengths and weaknesses - essentially looking at how to make them go faster.

Engineers analysed handling data, as handling directly influences speed and looked at unwanted vibrations that hamper good contact between the ice and the sled.

They then worked to tweak the designs of the bobsleighs and skeleton bob to tailor them to athletes and enhance their performance.

This process included an evaluation of all aspects of design - ranging from materials to aerodynamics - using simulators to identify changes that could make all the difference when it comes to setting a fast time.

Data: McLaren fitted test sleds with a range of sensors, enabling engineers to understand how to make them go faster.

Design: The company enhanced the standard design of the sleds to make performance improvements tailored to each athlete. They looked at the materials used, aerodynamics and handling capabilities using computational fluid dynamics and a massive wind tunnel.

Set-up: Engineers built adaptability into the designs for the sleds, enabling them to be configured specifically to suit athletes and tracks, rather than relying on a standardised design.

Manufacturing: the sleds are hand built and the company has used suppliers it also uses to build its F1 cars. It managed the assembly of sled components with attention to detail not seen before by Team GB.

Training: McLaren worked with athletes and coaches to help them learn how to maintain the sleds and understand how to make the best of technological improvements. The company has sent two engineers to the games to iron out any technical glitches.

Dr Hargrove said: ‘For the bobsleigh, we wanted to optimise the speed and manoeuvrability of the sled so that athletes can get a better line and therefore go faster.

‘To do this we made computer models and fed in lots of data. We then ran cycles, in the same way that we do for Formula One, to find tiny improvements – and when we did, created parts to test.’

Teams of engineers used a wind tunnel and computational fluid dynamics tools to reduce the drag of sleds and hone their aerodynamic bodies, which are made largely of carbon fibre and steel.

The Formula One company managed the manufacturing and assembly of sled components, helping to bring F1 techniques and attention to detail to the sports, which have in the past used old equipment.

‘In the skeleton, we are the only country with a completely adjustable approach. Before there was just one size of sled for men and women, which was not ideal,’ Dr Hargrove said.

‘Every component of the GB sled is adjustable compared to other countries we have real attention to detail. The quality of manufacturing is also really important.’

Each sled is hand built in comparison to the Team GB’s previous sleds, which McLaren described as 'pretty poor’.

Dr Hargrove said: ‘The team used to buy second hand sleds and by the time they were modified by different people – some good and some poor – over time, they were less effective. If we only made the sled well, it would have already been much better.’

Cool runnings: McLaren thinks that Team GB is 'definitely' capable of bagging a gold medal in Skeleton and that they have 'a good chance' in bobsleigh. The Sochi run is illustrated, which usually has three uphill sections to slow the sleds down

‘The design is very strictly governed by the rules and all teams use the same components. In that way it’s similar to Formula One as the FIA and F1 governing body dictate closely what we can do and we try to make incremental gains,’ she added.

One of the key ways to make a sled quicker is to improve the way that it takes corners and it is where fractions of seconds can be won and lost.

McLaren has worked with athletes in training to figure out how to maximise the impact of technological improvements made to the sleds.

Dr Hargrove said: ‘We spend a lot of time at the beginning of the cycles getting athlete feedback and with the alteration of any important detail. Some tweaks might mean a slight change in control, but once athletes learn to adapt they will go faster and we can show them this using a simulator.’

The company uses simulations so that athletes can train in virtual environments when they are not anywhere near an icy run – which is quite often in the UK.

Videos of tracks can be used to gather data and athletes are involved at different stages of changes to their sled’s performance.

Dr Hargrove said the competition is a little like Formula One on ice, ‘but the outcome is hugely dependent on the athletes – even more so than in Formula One.  In the Olympics, the athletes are at the centre of it all as we hope we’ve helped them as much as we can.’

She thinks the Team GB is ‘definitely’ capable of bagging a gold medal in Skeleton and that the athletes have ‘a good chance’ in bobsleigh.
