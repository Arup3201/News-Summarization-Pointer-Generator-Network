Petrol should already be down to around £1 a litre following the dramatic collapse in the price of oil, campaigners claimed last night.

Prices on forecourts across Britain have fallen by around 15 per cent since the summer with petrol now costing an average of £1.11 a litre and diesel £1.18.

But critics insist that because the oil has fallen in value by more than 50 per cent since June, prices should be around 10p lower – which would mean a litre of petrol costing just over £1.

Although the price of petrol and other essentials are falling, it is feared that households are not getting the savings they should from the slump in oil.

Crude oil, which affects the cost of everything from diesel to food, sank below 50 dollars a barrel yesterday for the first time in nearly six years – having traded at 115 dollars as recently as June.

George Osborne this week urged firms to slash their prices as politicians battled to show they are on the side of consumers.

The Chancellor said it was ‘vital’ that the fall in the price of oil ‘is passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares’.

Backbench Labour MP Rob Flello last night told the Mail that he is planning to table a so-called ‘early day motion’ in Parliament – possibly as soon as today – calling for an investigation into fuel prices in the UK. He said that ‘prices at the pumps should be decreasing in line’ with the fall in the oil price but added ‘this is not the case’.

The MP for Stoke-on-Trent South said: ‘Why is it that petrol prices can rise very quickly when the oil price goes up but do not fall equally quickly when the price goes down?’

Campaigners also questioned why diesel costs more than petrol and is not falling as fast. Motoring journalist Quentin Willson, part of the FairFuelUK campaign, said drivers are ‘incandescent with rage that these historic oil price falls are not accurately reflected at the pump’ and insisted the cost of a litre should be 10p lower. ‘Someone is profiteering by fleecing 32million UK motorists,’ he added.

The price of filling up a family car with a 70-litre tank with unleaded petrol has fallen from around £92 to £78 since the summer. Cutting the price of fuel by another 10p a litre would save motorists a further £7.

Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said: ‘Someone is ripping off the tax paying road user. It’s not just the Government who takes 70 per cent in tax every time we fill up, unknown commercial operators are holding back on cutting pump prices for personal gain.’

The AA said that with petrol at £1.11 a litre, the Government takes 76p in duty and VAT, while forecourt owners make between 4p and 6p in profit. The cost of the product itself is just 25p.

Britain’s major supermarkets are waging a brutal petrol price war in a desperate attempt to win over customers, with Asda announcing a 2p cut in its petrol price this week, meaning a new maximum charge of £1.07 a litre.

The RAC has said there is ‘every reason to think petrol at under £1 in early 2015 is a very real prospect’. But Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent garages, said: ‘Petrol retailers are passing on the lower oil cost to their customers.’

Families are being robbed of £140 a year by the ‘big six’ energy giants because they have failed to pass on falls in the cost of gas and electricity, it is claimed.

The wholesale price of gas is down by some 30 per cent in the past year, while electricity is down by 15 per cent. However, the companies have refused to pass on this reduction, and have pocketed some £2billion that should have been handed over to millions of struggling customers.

Around 60 per cent of households, or 14.4million, are on standard variable tariffs which industry analysts and consumer groups say should have meant their bills fell over the past year. Industry regulator Ofgem has asked the Competition & Markets Authority to launch a full inquiry into the market. But this will take more than a year and Ofgem has no powers to force the ‘big six’ suppliers – British Gas, SSE, EDF, Eon, Npower and Scottish Power – to pass on a fair cut in bills.

Calculations by industry experts TheEnergyShop.com suggest consumers should have seen a fall of £140 in the average annual bill of £1,225 if the drop in wholesale prices had been passed on.

Energy analysts ICIS Heren said there is currently a glut of gas and wholesale prices will continue to fall through 2015. Energy firms argue they buy energy far advance so it takes time for lower prices to feed through.
