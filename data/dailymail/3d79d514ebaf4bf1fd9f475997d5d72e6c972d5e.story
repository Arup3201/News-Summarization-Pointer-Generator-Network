The daring seafarers who went on Christopher Columbus’ second trip to the New World in 1493 had major obstacles to overcome in their journey.

Not only were they stepping into the unknown to find a home, but a new study suggests they may have also suffered from scurvy while sailing across the Atlantic.

The scurvy killed many of the early colonisers, researchers claim, causing the ultimate demise of the La Isabela settlement within just four years of it being founded.

Researchers believe the colonisers beat most of the scurvy by the time they died, but the disease may have contributed to a wave of deaths in the early colony.

La Isabela, the first permanent European town in the Western Hemisphere, was abandoned within just four years of being established amid sickness and deprivation.

Bones of sailors and colonists from graves behind the abandoned village's small churchyard have been unearthed from the site since the 1980s.

La Isabela was established in what is now the Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. It was one of the first European settlements in America.

It was founded by Christopher Columbus during his second voyage in 1493 and named after Queen Isabella I of Castile.

Hunger and disease is thought to have soon led to mutiny, punishment, disillusion, and more hunger and disease.

A group of settlers, led by Bernal de Pisa, attempted to capture and make off with several ships and go back to Spain.

La Isabela's demise took place in 1496 when Columbus decided to abandon it in favour of a new settlement, which is now known as Santo Domingo.

‘They were still encased in earth when we started the study. We had to clean the bones to proceed,’ study author Vera Tiesler told National Geographic.

Historians have blamed smallpox, influenza, and malaria for the town's failure, but the latest study by Mexico's Universidad Autonoma de Yucatán argues scurvy was the main cause.

At least 20 of the 27 skeletons had signs—ridges carved in the outer lining of bones—of what the study describes as 'severe scurvy.'

Scurvy, caused by one to three months of vitamin C deficiency, plagued seafarers until the 18th century. Symptoms included lethargy, anaemia, and, the re-opening of old wounds.

Researchers suggest the voyagers might have avoided scurvy if they'd sailed directly from Spain to La Isabela - a journey of two months or less.

When Columbus and his companions reached the Americas, they landed at a Hispaniola outpost first.

‘It was especially long, this trip - three months. And that's exactly the time scurvy needs to be in full bloom,’ Professor Tiesler said.
