Former Prime Minister John Major has praised the'guts and drive' shown by immigrants

John Major has praised immigrants for having Tory instincts – and said most do not come here for benefits.

The former prime minister said immigrants had the ‘guts and drive’ to travel vast distances to Britain’s shores to make life better for themselves and their families.

He said this desire to improve their lives was a ‘very Conservative instinct’ of wanting to improve their lives.

And he said that, in his experience, not all immigrants came to the UK ‘to benefit from our social security system’, he said.

The welcoming tone is in stark contrast to that used by the current incumbent of Number 10, David Cameron.

The Prime Minister wants to see the number of immigrants brought down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands.

He has also pledged to fight for a renegotiation of our relationship with the EU, to give us more powers over our borders and to crack down on benefit tourism.

Sir John also revealed that he knew the day after he won the 1992 election that he would go on to lose the next one five years later.

He made his comments during an interview with the historian Peter Hennessy for the BBC Radio 4 programme, Reflections.

The former Tory leader was talking about his time as a young man when he lived in modest circumstances with his family in Brixton, south London.

‘There was a different social value placed on immigration,’ said Sir John. ‘I saw immigration at very close quarters in the 1950s.

‘They shared my house. They were my neighbours. I played with them as boys. I didn't see people who had come here just to benefit from our social system. I saw people with guts and the drive to travel halfway across the world in many cases to better themselves and their families.

‘And I think that is a very Conservative instinct.’

David Cameron has taken a hard line on immigration - vowing to reduce the net figure to below 100,000. But the Prime Minister looks set to miss his target after a surge in European immigration

Sir John's remarks are in stark contrast to Conservative election campaigns since he lost the 1997 election to Tony Blair. Lord Howard faced criticism for his campaign against Labour immigration policies in 2005

In the programme, Sir John also admits that he knew as early as 1992 that he would not win the 1997 general election.

‘The day after the 1992 general election, Chris Patten [the Conservative chairman] and I sat in the White Room at Number 10,’ he said.

‘Chris had lost his seat at Bath. And we agreed that in winning a fourth successive term, we had stretched the democratic elastic as far as it would go, and unless Labour collapsed, we would have little chance of winning the next election. 

He said that after the pound dropped out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992: ‘I was never sure whether I should have resigned or not’, he said.

‘I asked the views of people I respected like Douglas Hurd and I think Norman Fowler and also people who were not politicians about whether I should resign, and their view was unequivocally that I shouldn’t and that if a Prime Minister did resigns a few months after winning an election that the government itself was doomed. Now whether that was the right decision to stay on or not, I was never certain.

‘I was never in any doubt that winning the 1997 election would be very difficult. I was reinforced in that view by the impact of Black Wednesday, I thought it overwhelmingly likely that we would have lost.

‘In one sense it was liberating. It meant I could go and do, as Sarah Hogg [his Policy Unit head], for one, repeatedly said to me, you can do what you think is right.

‘You don’t have to politically trim. You can do what you think is right and economically we did.’

Sir John said his party was ‘so difficult’ over Europe, because the previous generation of Conservatives who had lived through two world wars and believed in peace in Europe at all costs were replaced by younger Conservatives who had grown up in ‘more ideological’ age.

He said Margaret Thatcher went into the ERM because the recession of the late 1980s saw inflation and unemployment soar. He said the idea she was pushed into joining was ‘utterly, utterly false’.

Sir John revealed that Tony Blair’s reforms to the health service were ‘the sort of thing I wished to do from the first moment I dreamed of going into politics’.

‘I shall live with regret to my dying day that I did not have the wherewithal, and was not in a political position, to go down the route of those reforms which were the sort of things I wished to do from the first moment I dreamed of going into politics,’ he said.

The former leader said he would also have liked to increase teachers’ pay and build more inner-city homes.
