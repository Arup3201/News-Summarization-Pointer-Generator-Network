Miranda Kerr and Cara Delevingne may have been catwalk royalty at Stella McCartney's show this morning but Princess Charlene of Monaco was the real deal in Paris this afternoon.

The 35-year-old Royal took her prime position seat on the front row at the Akris spring/summer 14 show in the French capital.

She looked flawless in a structured black dress and dazzling diamonds and pearls.

The former Olympic swimmer turned out to watch the collection at Paris Fashion Week, described by its designer as 'a dream of fabrics and nature - moved forward through technology.'

She was joined on the front row by Peter Kriemler, Akris’s global president, who is responsible for handling management and manufacturing of the brand.

The princess is a firm fan of the Swiss fashion label, which specialises in luxury goods for women and was founded by Alice Kriemler-Schoch.

The wife of Albert II, Prince of Monaco has a short list of designer labels that she favors and Akris is right at the top.

The princess seemed in great spirits in Paris after finally putting rumours to bed over the 'turbulent' start to her marriage.

She said in an interview last month that the tears streaming down her cheeks at her wedding 
to Albert in 2011 were not the result of a series of rows 
over his womanising ways, but in fact tears of happiness.

She
described this speculation, as well as rumours she attempted to escape 
in the days leading up to her wedding, as 'categorical lies'.
