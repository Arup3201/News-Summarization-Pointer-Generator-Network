TV presenter Dr Michael Mosley will eat black pudding made from his own blood for a new documentary. 

In a variety of tests, Dr Mosley will take an in-depth look at blood for a medical series on BBC Four.

He will undergo six experiments on his own blood, including injecting it with snake venom to see how it can clot within seconds and starving it of oxygen.

The Wonderful World of Blood, which features specialist photography to look at blood 'as never seen before', is one of several new science shows announced today. 

Dr Mosley will also chart the journey from single cell to human being in 9 Months That Made You for BBC Two. 

In the show, he will look at the 'minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour' development of a baby in the first 280 days of life from a single cell. 

The series will examine the moment the face forms, the first beat of the heart and the day the nerves set off their first signals.

Previously, Dr Mosley, a former City banker, has explored the benefits of high intensity exercise and intermittent fasting. 

He was credited with popularising the 5:2 diet via the Eat, Fast, and Live Longer documentary. This involves fasting for two days a week and then unconstrained eating the other five days. 

The diet has since been followed by celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez. 

In his most recent show, Oxford university educated Dr Mosley looked at the world of parasites and deliberately infested himself with them. 

The BBC screened a Horizon documentary, The Nine Months That Made You, in 2011, which looked at how much of a human being's health has been determined by the time we get out of the womb. 

The presenter will undergo six experiments on his own blood for the upcoming BBC4 programme

Elsewhere, TV presenter Dr George McGavin inspects a 350-year-old oak tree in Wytham Woods, near Oxford, in 'forensic detail' over a whole year.  

Other programmes include Natural Born Hustlers presented by wildlife expert Chris Packham, on how animals use optical illusions, camouflage and mimicry to stay alive.

The documentary will feature 'cross-dressing birds, a lizard which fakes its own death and two-timing monkeys'.
