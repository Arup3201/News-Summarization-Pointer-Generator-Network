A feminist activist ran topless through St Peter's Square and rushed the nativity scene before attempting to flee with the baby Jesus figurine. 

The woman, who had the words 'God Is Woman' written on her chest, started her protest just one hour after Pope Francis delivered his Christmas message.  

Thousands of pilgrims were still standing in the famous square when the woman, who is a member of Femen, was ambushed by a guard on her way off the platform. She was quickly arrested by officers from the Vatican police.

Restrained: The woman, from feminist group Femen, was cornered by Vatican guards on the stage

The Pope had unveiled the Jesus figure, part of a large nativity scene last night when he marked Christmas with a late-night Mass in St Peter's Basilica. 

Today's incident was captured on film and posted online this afternoon.

In the 54-second clip, the woman is seen running from the crowd up a flight of stairs on to the stage where the nativity scene is set up. 

She rushes across the platform towards the stable that had been built to represent the one that Jesus was born in. 

She grabs the figurine before trying to flee the square from the other side of the stage. 

But just moments later, she is ambushed by a member from the Gendarmerie Corps of Vatican City State, the Vatican's security force. 

Aggressive: The woman was seen shouting and screaming as she struggled with Vatican officers 

Arrested: The protester was led off by officers who covered her bare chest with a black jacket, seen above

Resistant: She smiled happily as she was led off to the stage and towards a waiting police vehicle

Crowds of onlookers filmed the protest as she was restrained by officers before being escorted to a waiting car. 

The protest was designed to criticise 'the centuries-old Vatican stance on women's rights for own body and reproductive function,' according to a post on the group's website. 

It was staged less than 24 hours after the Jesus figurine was unveiled by Pope Francis as he marked Christmas with a late-night mass in St Peter's Basilica.
