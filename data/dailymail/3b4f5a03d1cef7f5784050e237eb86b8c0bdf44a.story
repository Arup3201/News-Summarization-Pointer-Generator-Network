A 22-month-old boy fatally overdosed after his mother took morphine and Xanax and used meth before breastfeeding him, authorities have said.

Lacey Kertz, 26, was arrested in Jefferson County, Missouri for child abuse or neglect resulting in death on Wednesday, nearly seven months after the death of her youngest son, Carson.

The little boy had amphetamines, morphine and meth in his 
urine after his death, toxicology reports from the St. Louis County Medical
 Examiner’s Office showed, and he also suffered from pneumonia.

Dr Michael Graham, who performed the autopsy, previously said the amount of morphine in his system would have been enough to kill an adult without a tolerance for the drug.

After the toxicology results, the sheriff’s office sent its reports on the case to the prosecutor's office around March. Jefferson County authorities finally arrested her in Barnhart on Wednesday.

He passed away on October 28 - the morning after his mother took Vicodin, morphine and Xanax pills and used methamphetamine at their home.

She told authorities that she also gave her son two melatonin pills to help him sleep and might have given him Tylenol - but couldn't remember, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

Before she put him down to sleep on October 27, she also found him playing with a bottle of Trazadone pills - an anti-depressant - that he had opened and dumped out on to the bed.

She said she took one of the pills from his lips and put her fingers down his throat to make him vomit, but it was unsuccessful.

Despite him potentially ingesting the pills, she did not seek medical attention, authorities said. She also noted that he started 'acting funny' at around 1.30am, so she held him until he went to sleep.

'Neglect': Kertz had also seen her son dump out a bottle of painkillers and removed one from his lips, she told authorities. But she did not seek medical attention and he was found unresponsive the next day

He was found unresponsive the next morning inside the home in House Springs.

After
 his death, Children's Division reports noted that the mobile park home 
was filthy. The beds were covered in trash and there were buckets of 
urine and feces throughout the house, a report said.

There was also rotting food throughout the house and the toilets didn't seem to be working.

She also did not have prescriptions for the drugs she took, the Post-Dispatch noted.

Kertz was arrested in Barnhart on Wednesday and is being held without bail.

Relatives said they were relieved that the little boy was finally getting justice.

'It seems like I've been waiting forever for something to finally be done,' Sheryl Sullivan, Carson's paternal grandmother, told the Post-Dispatch.

Kertz and her two sons, who had different fathers, had lived most of the childrens' lives with their grandmother. When they moved out, relatives had made several reports to child abuse hotlines about Kertz's drug use and about their living conditions.

State Children's Division employees investigated but they records show they did not find anything to give them cause to remove the boys from her care.

'The death of any child is a tragedy, and the Department of Social Services will continue to work closely with law enforcement and the courts on this case to seek justice,' Brian Kinkade, director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, said in a statement.
