The full sunny glare of Mother Nature ensures the world is aware of Simon Cowell’s jowls.

In TV land, however, he appears to have lost ten years.

The music mogul happily admits to using weird and wonderful treatments to make himself look more youthful.

But the Mail can reveal the secret of his vanishing jowls on Britain’s Got Talent at the weekend owed more to electrical engineers and strategic studio lighting.

Let there be light: The four lamps can be seen in front of Cowell on the BGT judges' table. Amanda Holden has none

The 53-year-old insists that no fewer than four extra lamps are focused on him as he sits on the judging panel of the ITV talent show. These help fill in the shadows that might otherwise be cast by set lighting and help make his face look smooth and firm. In contrast, fellow judges Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and David Walliams are said to sit in relative gloom.

During last weekend’s show, fans inundated Twitter with comments about Cowell’s appearance.

Even Alan Sugar tweeted a question to Cowell on behalf of his wife, asking: ‘My wife and her friend Joy want to know what you have done to your face?’

Cowell has often spoken about his battle to stay young.

The multi-millionaire recently admitted that he completes hundreds of 
press-ups a day, work-outs four times a week, regularly uses  Botox and 
colonic irrigation treatments, and even has vitamin injections 
administered by a nurse in a bit to maintain his youthful appearance.

Last summer Cowell was forced to deny speculation that he’d had a neck 
lift to tighten up the skin around his chin after he was photographed in
Los Angeles with a plaster behind his ear. At the time, a spokesman for
Cowell insisted that the star has cut himself by accident.

He also revealed that he uses a £10.95 lemon bath milk, which he says he uses daily to help soften and perfume his skin.

Asked about rumours that he does 500 press-ups a day, he said: ‘It’s all true. I mean, not 500 push-ups, but several hundred.

‘I
work out three or four times a week, I have Botox, take tons of 
vitamins and vitamin infusions - if you believe that these things work, 
you will feel better.’

Perhaps the most usual of his beauty treatments is a sheep placenta facial, which he is said to have regularly.

It
involves having his skin exfoliated for 30 minutes at the beginning of 
the process, before a bright LED light is directed at his face to open 
his pores.

A beauty professional then applies the placenta which is mixed with 24 carat gold flakes and comes in the form of a gel.

The multi-millionaire recently admitted he does hundreds of press-ups a day, regularly uses Botox and colonic irrigation treatments, vitamin injections – and even facials using sheep placenta.
