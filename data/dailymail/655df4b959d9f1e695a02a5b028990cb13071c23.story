Britain's top directors have an average pension worth £260,000 a year, an investigation reveals today.

One executive is on an annual deal of £1million, according to a report that appears to expose the widening gulf between ordinary workers’ pensions and those enjoyed by bosses.

It found a director of a company in the FTSE index of the UK’s 100 biggest publicly listed firms has a fund worth £259,947 a year, while the average worker has an annual company pension worth £10,452.

The biggest winner is David Brennan, the ousted boss of the drugs giant AstraZeneca, who has retired on a pension worth £1million a year – 37 times the average salary of a full-time employee.

Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, which commissioned the report, attacked Britain’s corporate elite for enjoying pay and bonuses ‘beyond common decency’ while the number of private sector workers saving into a company pension fell to 2.9million, the lowest level since records began in 1953.

‘But not content with grabbing an ever larger slice of the UK’s earnings pie, they are adding to the country’s growing inequality with platinum-plated pensions,’ she said.

The bosses of two banking giants bailed out by the taxpayer received big pension windfalls.

Antonio Horta-Osorio of Lloyds was given a retirement contribution last year worth £549,000, while Stephen Hester of RBS took £420,000 – paid in cash.

Four of the five bosses with the biggest pension deals work for oil companies, with Sir Frank Chapman of oil and gas firm BG Group, Peter Voser of Royal Dutch Shell, and BP’s Byron Grote and Bob Dudley all on deals worth more than £800,000 a year.

It comes as official figures show the number of private sector workers saving into a company pension has collapsed to 2.9million, the lowest level since records began in 1953.

Experts warn a generation of Britons will be ‘unable to afford to retire’ after a lifetime of hard work as the number of people with a pension has ‘shrivelled at a seemingly unstoppable rate.’

In the 1960s, a peak of more than eight million private sector workers had a company pension scheme, but the numbers have declined at a dangerous pace ever since.

Overall, the TUC’s report also highlights how directors can typically retire on a full pension at the age of 60 at a time when the State pension age is rising.

At present, a man cannot get his full State pension until the age of 65, and women’s State pension age is being gradually increased to the same age.  Both will eventually rise to 67 and beyond.

The average ‘pension pot’ of a FTSE 100 director with a ‘defined benefit’ pension is £4.74million, a rise of £41,000 over the last year, according to the TUC.

The research is based on the pension entitlements of 294 directors which appear in their company’s latest annual reports, published each year by FTSE 100 firms.

The Government is desperate to stop the rot in Britain’s pensions system.

Last October, new rules were introduced forcing bosses to pay into a pension for their workers for the first time.

Up to nine million workers will be enrolled into a pension by 2018, the deadline for all firms, including start-ups, to have signed up their workers.

Since October, around 1.4million workers have been automatically enrolled into a pension scheme. Less than 10 per cent have subsequently ‘opted out’.
