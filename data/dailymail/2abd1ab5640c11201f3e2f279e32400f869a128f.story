An animal educator was robbed this week when thieves stole his SUV packed with twenty exotic animals.

'Wildman' Phil Rakoci said he left his beloved animals in his vehicle outside a Denver Walmart, leaving it running to keep the animals warm. He uses a remote lock to secure their safety, but somehow, it failed to function properly.

Mr Rakoci is horrified that his animals, which he brings to schools to teach children about wildlife, are not being properly cared for or worse.

'They're not just props, they're live animals. They know me. I know them,' he said toÂ 9News.

'It's pretty tough. I don't care; keep the suburban, the stuff in it. I just want to get the animals back and have them live through this.'

In all, a 3-legged, 50-pound African tortoise named Stumpy; a 13-foot Burmese python, a rattlesnake, five non-poisonous snakes, three scorpions, five lizards, two turtles, one gecko, and one tarantula, along with Rakoci's personal belongings were stolen with the car.

Mr Rakoci said the animals are transported in solid, gray tubs across the country.

Care: Mr Rakoci is horrified that his animals, which he brings to schools to teach children about wildlife, are not being properly cared for or worse

The most devastating loss, Mr Rakoci said, is being without Stumpy, his beloved tortoise.

Stumpy, an African Spurred tortoise, was abandoned on Mr Rakoci's doorstep seven years ago.

He was missing part of one of his front legs and the other front leg was gone, ABC15 reports. Mr Rakoci took him in and named him Stumpy, fashioning wheels to his shell so he can scoot around.

Stumpy is the star of Mr Rakoci's show and has more than 1,000 Facebook fans.

'He's pretty friendly for a tortoise,' Mr Rakoci said. 'He loves people.'

Englewood police are frantically searching for the animals, but they say there are no leads so far.

The car is a Suburban SUV, dark blue, with an Arizona license plate 'TEDDIJO'.
