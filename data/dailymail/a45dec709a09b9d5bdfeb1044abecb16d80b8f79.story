MSNBC is apologizing for a Cinco de Mayo segment that featured a staff member onscreen wearing a sombrero, shaking maracas and taking a swig from a bottle of tequila which was punctuated with 'olé'.

The network said on Tuesday the interlude on its Way Too Early show on Monday just before 6am EST featuring correspondent Louis Burgdorf and host Thomas Roberts wasn't intended to be disrespectful.

The show apologized online and says it will express its regret on Wednesday on the air.

MSNBC has come under fire after one of their hosts donned a sombrero and maracas during a Cinco de Mayo segment on Monday

MSNBC is set to apologize on-air tomorrow for the segment which showed a host Louis Burgdorf swigging from a bottle of tequila

Host Thomas Roberts also danced in circles with maracas in front of a sombrero

During the slot, Burgdorf wanders across the screen wearing a sombrero, shaking maracas and swigging from a bottle of Jose Cuervo tequila - as the network's misguided attempt to point out that Monday was Cinco de Mayo.

'It's also an excuse to drink tequila on a Monday morning at work for Louis,' Roberts said, adding 'you have to drink the whole thing and eat the worm.'

He referred to it as his 'go-go juice'.

Hugo Balta, president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, says it was abominable that the segment was done by a news organization.

'This is simply the worst example I have seen of a discriminatory stereotypical portrayal of any community by any media.'

He says it feeds 'the ignorant misconceptions of a rich and proud people who unfortunately are too often portrayed as caricatures to be scoffed at'.

The holiday marks an 1862 battle victory by Mexican troops. It is celebrated in the U.S. with parades and revelry.

The show's control room got in on the 'festivities' as well as a sombrero was passed around

Burgdorf, who goes by the handle 'NBCLou', frequently posts photos from his correspondent gigs. He posed up with Moet bottle on the Vanity Fair red carpet this year, which he covered for Morning Joe

Playful: Burgdorf also went to Los Angeles this year to cover the Golden Globes for the network

The man-about-town is no stranger to site gags with alcohol in the past
