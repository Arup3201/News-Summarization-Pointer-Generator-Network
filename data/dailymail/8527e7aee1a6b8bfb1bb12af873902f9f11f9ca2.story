The House of Lords refused to share catering services with MPs because they were worried about the quality of champagne, it has been claimed.

A plan to merge to management of bars and restaurants in both Houses of Parliament was jettisoned after peers expressed fears of being forced to drink cheap bubbly, according to a former Commons chief.

While the Lords and MPs share IT, cleaning and archive services, reaching agreement on champagne purchasing was seen as a step too far.

The House of Lords refused to merge catering contracts with the Commons because they 'feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service'

A group of MPs is examining the way the House of Commons is run, following the row over John Bercow's plan to install an Australian woman as Clerk.

But one of the biggest differences has emerged over their taste in fine wines.

Former Clerk Sir Malcolm Jack revealed the tensions between the two Houses of Parliament when the committee took evidence.

He insisted that 'joint services must be a good idea' and they already exist in ICT and the running of the estate.

'Nevertheless, there are historical differences between the Houses.'

He said there had been a long running argument – lasting 20 or even 50 years – about whether the elaborately decorated Pugin Room, complete with a crystal chandelier and deep red carpets, belongd to the Commons or the Lords.

Sir Malcolm added: 'The person in charge of catering came with proposals to provide a joint catering service, and it was eventually thrown out in the House of Lords because the Lords feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service.' 

Former Labour Cabinet minister Jack Straw, chairman of the Commons governance committee, was taken aback by the claim, asking: 'Did you make that up? Is that true?'

But Sir Malcolm insisted it had happened. 'Yes, it is true, he said. 'It should not be beyond the wit of man, Chair, to brigade the services together and deliver them differently.

Former Lib Dem minister David Heath, who sits on the committee, remarked: 'You can never underestimate the capacity for self-parody in this place.'

Since 2010 the House of Lords has bought in more than 17,000 bottles of champagne at a cost of £265,770. It is the univalent of five bottles each for every peer.

The stunned MPs returned to the topic later, when DUP MP Ian Paisley wondered whether the Lords' fears about the quality of champagne in the Commons was justified, the Observer reported.

'I feel compelled to ask: were they right about the champagne?' Mr Paisley said.

Sir Malcolm insisted: 'I don't think they were; we were very careful in our selection.'

The champagne row caused such a storm that MPs raised it again at a later hearing of the committee, as they grilled Lord Rogers, who stood down as Clerk of the Commons this year after reports of rows with Mr Bercow.

Lord Rogers warned of 'suspicion' between the two Houses over the prospect of joint working. 'You also need to look at where it will really make a difference.

'It would be very difficult to get a joint catering service. I must be very careful for a number of reasons what I say here.'

Mr Paisley asked if he was referring to the dispute over champagne, but Lord Rogers refused to get drawn into it. 'No, I am not going into the quality of the champagne. People are very possessive about some services. Catering is an absolute classic.'

However, a Lords spokesman said: 'The House of Lords would not reject a merger of catering services with the House of Commons simply on the supply of champagne. 

'The House of Lords catering department and subsidy is significantly smaller than that of the House of Commons, and it is not clear that any merger would produce savings in the costs of the House of Lords. All alcohol sold in the House of Lords is sold at a profit.'
