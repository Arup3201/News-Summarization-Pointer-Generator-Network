Former Ireland international Kevin Kilbane has made an official complaint to the FA after West Ham fans chanted offensive songs mocking the disabled at Spurs on Sunday.

The Match of the Day pundit contacted the FA after a close friend reported West Ham fans sang ‘Harry Kane talks like a **** and plays like one too’ during the 2-2 draw at White Hart Lane.

The former Everton, Sunderland, Hull, West Brom and Wigan winger, whose daughter 10-year-old Elsie has Down’s Syndrome, has been told the FA is launching a full investigation into his complaint.

Other members of the public have also contacted the FA to make complaints which follows reports that West Ham fans chanted an anti-Semitic song on a train.

Kilbane, a patron of the Down’s Syndrome Association charity, said: ‘I am sure they understand they are causing offence. You cannot sweep it under the carpet and label it as ignorance. It is visible and clear and like racist or homophobic chanting, it is intended to cause offence.

‘I want to be able to take my kids to football matches and when Elsie gets older she will understand about her condition and I would not want her to hear that kind of chanting. If her sister Isla heard it, she would be devastated too, as my friend’s sons were.

‘I spoke him and he was extremely upset and I felt I had to report it. No family should have to put up with it at football matches.

‘It was very clear and sadly it appeared to be from a large number of West Ham fans in the ground. This was not isolated to a handful of people.

‘This is a wider society problem, not just a problem with football and idiots are using football as a tool to show their ignorance and discrimination.

‘I have spoken to the FA and they have assured me they will investigate it thoroughly.

‘In all my time playing and watching football, I have never heard this before. Hopefully we can do something to make sure it isn’t again and this awful chant does not spread.’

A West Ham club spokesman said: ‘If any individual is found to have behaved in an inappropriate way, the club’s zero-tolerance policy dictates that they will face the strongest possible action, including the option of a life ban.’ 

Although Kilbane was not at the game on Sunday, Andy Merriman, a Spurs season ticket holder and ghost-writer of his autobiography Killa contacted him immediately afterwards.

Merriman wrote the moving book A Minor Adjustment following the birth of his daughter Sarah who also has Down’s Syndrome.

His son Dan, a trainee lawyer, has also written to the FA to complain about the behaviour of West Ham supporters.
