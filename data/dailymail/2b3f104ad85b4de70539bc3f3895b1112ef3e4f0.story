While the big freeze has seen a large part of the country shivering under a blanket of snow, some areas have been enjoying positively spring-like conditions.

In Torpoint, Cornwall, Rachel Ellen, 14, admired the blooming daffodils yesterday while out walking her cocker spaniel Nimbus.

By contrast, in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, a horse struggled to find any grass to eat in a wintry field. 

Despite many parts of the UK being buffeted by wind, rain and snow, Torpoint in Cornwall was warm enough for daffodils to grow, spotted by local Rachel Ellen (pictured) while walking her cocker spaniel Nimbus

The rest of the country was not as lucky as Cornwall with heavy snow in some areas including Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire where a horse struggled to find any grass to eat in a wintry field (pictured)

The forecast is for more snow over Scotland and Northern Ireland until Tuesday.

The Met Office says that most of the South is expected to escape the snow, although it will be frosty and then wet as a band of rain sweeps in from across the Channel.

Areas, such as Cumbria (pictured) have been covered with a heavy blanket of snow but the Met Office says that most of the South is expected to escape further drifts

More snow has been predicted in Scotland and Northern Ireland but as this picture of Craig, 40 and Christopher Wallace sledging in Eaglesham, near Glasgow, shows, not everyone is dreading more of the white stuff
