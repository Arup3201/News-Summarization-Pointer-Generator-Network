A former Red Beret who became the first man to be extradited from an Afghan jail to face trial in the UK has been found guilty of torturing two business rivals.

Anthony Malone, 39, spent two years and nine months in Kabul’s notorious Pul-e-Charkhi prison for allegedly bribing an official before he was returned to Britain in September 2010.

The former paratrooper, who served in Ulster, told jurors he was tortured and starved by prison staff and felt ‘abandoned’ by the UK government.

A campaign for his release led by his sister Maria Blades gathered thousands of Facebook followers who claimed his human rights were being infringed.

Even Prime Minister David Cameron pledged his support, assuring Malone’s family and friends that his ‘worrying’ case was being looked into.

But jurors heard Malone had fled the UK in 2007 after inflicting a brutal nine-hour torture and kidnap ordeal on brothers Mohammed and Haq Nawaz.

He refused to come into court as he was 
convicted of two counts of actual bodily harm, two of false imprisonment
and two of kidnapping.

Ranjit Gojra, 40, was also found guilty of two counts of actual bodily harm while property investor Sanjeev Dhir, 37, was cleared of involvement after a retrial at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

The court had heard how Mohammed, then 27, and Haq Nawaz, then 51, were tied up, hooded and beaten after they were lured Dhir’s offices in Stoke Newington High Street, north London.

Malone, originally from Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, abducted them in a row over a £1.9million property deal.

Teetotal Muslim Mohammed was tied to a chair, stripped of his trousers and doused in alcohol in a nine hour ordeal.

A blow torch was held to his face and he was hit across the legs with a hammer.

The brothers were then locked in a van and taken on a terror ride across London, onto the M1 and around the M25.

Mohammed was then subjected to a ‘mock execution’ where he was made to kneel on the gravel and had a metal object pressed against his neck.

The brothers were later dumped in the Chelsea area in the early hours of April 21, 2007.

Gojra, of Belvedere, Kent, was convicted of two counts of actual bodily harm but cleared of the false imprisonment and kidnapping charges.

Dhir, of Rainham, Essex, was cleared of two counts of actual bodily harm, false imprisonment and kidnapping.
