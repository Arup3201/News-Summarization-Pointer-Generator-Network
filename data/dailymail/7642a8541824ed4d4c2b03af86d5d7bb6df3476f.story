Over the years, I have used many weapons in my battle against frizz. There have been the straighteners and the steaming tongs, which looked — and felt — like medieval instruments of torture, not to mention the bucketloads of serums, quenching masks and elasticisers, all promising to transform my fine, fly-away hair into sleek, glossy locks.

Yet it seems the search for perfect hair is still so elusive that, in the 21st century, we are resorting to physics.

Indeed, if Professor Stephen Hawking ever designed a hairbrush, the Brilliant Shine Ionic Brush would be it.

A brush with genius? Tanith with the Ionic gadget

This battery-powered brush works by sending out an invisible beam of microscopic particles, which claim to fight static build-up, to your hair.

At first glance, it looks like a normal hairbrush. However, in the middle of the head is a hole, inside of which are two tiny sets of bristles, which emit a cloud of negatively charged atoms, or ions.

Air-conditioning, pollution and man-made fibres can all cause a build-up of static electricity in hair, as can brushing and towel drying — making it difficult to keep your style neat and under control.

Ionic Brush — made by BaByliss and selling for £30 — is said to help because the ions neutralise the static charge, thus smoothing the hair.

So far the reception has been rapturous. One reviewer described it as ‘a blow-dry in a brush’. Another hailed it as a ‘brush with genius’.

A husband, who bought the product for his wife on the Amazon website, even credits it with improving his marriage, declaring: ‘A happy wife is a happy life.’

So does the brush live up to the hype? I admit straight away that science was never my strong point at school. But even I could discover an interest in particle physics if it means no more bad hair days or expensive blow-dries.

The claims that this brush changes the static charge in your hair and stops it going too frizzy seems fine, but considering my fine, wavy hair seems to defy the laws of Nature, could it work for me?

The handle contains a compartment for two AA batteries, which I fit right away. As I have no idea what to expect, I press the ‘on’ switch with some trepidation.

British women spend ten minutes a day, or ten days a year, brushing their hair

At first nothing seems to happen. A yellow light appears to indicate the brush is working, but it is eerily silent. There is none of the usual vibrating, heating or twirling you expect from hair gadgets.

I inspect the ionic generators more closely and press the brush to my ear — and realise it is making a very faint crackling noise.

When I begin brushing my hair, all doubts disappear. Normally my hair is so dry and coarse that I have to drag a brush through it, but this glides effortlessly through to the ends.

My tresses seem instantly softer and smoother without the help of any sprays or serums. I won’t say it’s ‘a blow-dry in a brush’, but my hair certainly has no right to look this good after so little effort.

I am so intrigued that I turn ‘mad scientist’ to test the  theory behind the brush. Using a balloon left over from my daughter Clio’s ninth birthday party, I frantically rub the side of my head to generate an electrical charge and get my hair standing on end. The brush even conquers this frizz.

Still, so much for the lab. What about real life? When I put the brush to the test again the next morning, I find it helps master my bed-head quicker than usual.

Tanith ran rigorous tests to see just how good the brush is. She used a balloon to frantically rub the side of her head to generate an electrical charge and get my hair standing on end - which the brush managed to calm

In the evening, I have to attend  an event at a posh restaurant. After a hard day rushing around, my hair is far from red-carpet ready.

When I first used the brush, my hair had been blow-dried eight hours earlier. This time it has a different effect, reinstating the soft curls I had in the morning and making them look sleeker and smoother.

Clio, who loves watching me do my hair, pays me the ultimate compliment by telling me, completely unsolicited, that I look like I’ve been to the hair salon. I’m thrilled.

A few days later I wash my hair again and leave it completely as nature intended. As expected, it goes to frizz, the default position if my locks are not teased, coerced and forced to behave. They then look even worse — bushy as well as frizzy — after I get caught in a shower while walking the dog.

When I get home I brush them with my new secret weapon for five minutes. This time, it still manages to smooth down my hair, but it can’t create the shape or volume of a blow-dry.

However, when I pass my hands over my hair, it feels as smooth as if I’d been plastering it in a conditioning mask.

One of the downsides of the brush is that it would be easy to leave it switched on in the rush of getting ready to go out, and the batteries would run down.

But at £30, this gadget still costs less than a good-quality bristle brush, and it definitely saves loads of money on hair serums and smoothers.

Long ago I learned that I can never feel truly in control of my life unless I am in control of my hair — and every little helps.

For that reason alone, the Ionic Brush is a welcome addition to my armoury.
