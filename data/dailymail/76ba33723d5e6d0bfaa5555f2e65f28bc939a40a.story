Would you open up your holiday itinerary to strangers? That's what one intrepid traveller did. 

An American prize winner enjoyed the Ultimate Secret Tour around Iceland as recommended by 100,000 resident Icelanders - along with some with help from visitors and fans of the country.

This heart-warming film documents Jennifer Asmundson's secret tour through Iceland where she discovers stunning scenery and unique experiences.

The short film captures the journey of Ms Asmundson, a chef from Seattle, who was crowned the World’s Most Intrepid Tourist earlier this year after an online global search.

Ms Asmundson, who herself is from Icelandic descent, was invited to experience a unique secret winter tour of Iceland following a special crowd-sourced itinerary.

Entitled The Ultimate Secret Tour, the film is the latest installment of Share The Secret, a promotional campaign from the country’s tourism initiative, Inspired By Iceland.

The campaign draws on local knowledge to reveal some of the country’s hidden treasures by encouraging Icelanders and tourists to share their secrets and offer visitors the opportunity to discover unique experiences around the country all year round.

Top five Icelandic secrets as suggested by Icelanders and fans of Iceland the world over:

1. Visit a secret geothermal waterfall in Hjalteyri in the North of Iceland.

2. Hire a car and drive the Snæfellsnes peninsula in West Iceland to experience the most magical glacier in the world.

3. Take a plunge and go sea swimming in Seyðisfjörður in the East.

4. Catch your dinner. There are friendly fishermen all over Iceland who will take you on out on their boat for a small fee. Try Sandgerði for a shellfish feast.

5. As home of more published authors per-capita than anywhere else in the world, Reykjavik is the perfect place to immerse yourself in some of the countries best literature. Take in a play at the National Theatre, Harpa the modern concert hall or visit Fornbókabúðin at 53 Hverfisgata to experience some of the countries past. 

Recommendations from Facebook fans covered everything from extraordinary food dishes not listed on restaurant menus to a secret spot with the most spectacular view of the Northern Light. 

The journey explored all regions of Iceland, from Seyðisfjörður in the East, to Snæfellsnes in the West. 

The tour is showcased beautifully through Ms Asmundson's eyes as she travels across Iceland, searching out the country’s best kept, and often surprising secrets, as suggested by Iceland’s 100,000-strong army of Facebook fans.

Each day the team took on a new region of Iceland, offering new experiences and giving Jennifer the opportunity to see what makes each area special and unique. 

Using ‘insider knowledge’ from Icelanders alongside secret tips from visitors from all over the world, the tour took in everything from a trip to Lunga Art School in the East, to adventure in the deepest caves of the South. 

During the video Ms Asmundson says: 'I'm expecting to meet a bunch of amazing people, see some spectacular things and nature.'

Describing the abundance of breathtaking scenery she encountered the adventurous American tourist says: 'There are no words, they are just so amazingly beautiful, it literally takes your breath away.'

The North of Iceland offered adventure with skiing, super-jeep tours and local sushi made from freshly caught Icelandic ingredients. 

In Reykjavik the team experienced a little of what the country’s Capital has to offer, with trips to some of the best restaurants, galleries and visits to the local geothermal pools, which no trip to Iceland would be complete without.

Inga Hlín Pálsdóttir, Director, Tourism & Creative Industries at Promote Iceland said: 'We’re constantly looking at how to make our visitors experience richer and inviting the world to share their Iceland secrets with us has really struck a chord with open-minded travellers.

'Seeking out the most unlikely but incredible people and places has opened up a whole new side of Iceland and we’re excited to be sharing that.'

Latest stats suggest that tourists visiting Iceland are getting more adventurous with a 27.5 per cent increase in winter travellers between September 2013 and May 2014 compared to the same time period the previous year.
