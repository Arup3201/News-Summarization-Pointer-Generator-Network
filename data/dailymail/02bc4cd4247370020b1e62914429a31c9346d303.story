An Oregon family are appealing for help after their baby boy was born with webbed fingers and toes.

Baby De Sean's grandmother, Evelyn Ellis, is behind a GoFundMe page to raise at least $10,000 for the two-month-old's much-needed reconstructive surgery and the support he'll need as he heals.

De Sean was born with a rare condition that melds his fingers and toes together called split-hand split-foot malformation. It means that he is missing some digits, while others are fused together.

Both of his hands and feet are affected, which doctors told the family only happens in one in a million cases.

'When my 
daughter heard that, she cried: "My baby boy is one in a million!",' 
Ellis told MailOnline, laughing. 'They could not be more happy with their son. We would
 not trade him for the world.'

One in a million: Baby De Sean was born with a rare condition that fuses his fingers and toes together

Their doctors have said they often leave
 the surgeries until children with the condition are one to three years 
old, but De Sean's case is more severe, so they want to get to work 
right away.

The 
grandmother is now trying to raise money to support 
the family as the little boy undergoes surgeries, which need to be 
carried out as soon as possible to ensure that the boy can adapt to his 
new hands and feet.

'My job as 
his grandma is to support his family,' said Ellis, who works for Portland School District. 'Obviously he's my 
grandson but he is perfect. He melts the heart of everyone he meets. I 
couldn't be more proud of him.'

The
 family is hoping they can raise enough money on the fundraising website, which has already reached $5,000. Some 
of the costs will be covered by Shriners Hospital for Children, but the 
family will be left to foot the bill for further tests, as well as 
travel expenses.

'Long road ahead': Prints show the boy's foot and hands; in surgery, his fused fingers will be separated and straightened, while the clefts down the middle of his hands will have to be closed

Split hand/split foot malformation, also known as ectrodactyly, is a genetic disorder in which some fingers or toes are completely or partially absent, often combined with clefts in the hands or feet.

There may also be the appearance of webbing between fingers or toes, which is called syndactyly. The appearance may make the hands or feet look like claws.

It is a rare form of a congenital disorder in which the development of the hand is disturbed.

The incidence of cleft hand varies from 1 in 90,000 to 1 in 10,000 births depending on the used classification, but because both of De Sean's hands and feet are affected, doctors said his case is one in a million.

Surgery can be carried out to improve function of the fingers and thumb and to reduce the webbing between fingers.

His parents both work full time - 28-year-old De Andre at a bank and 25-year-old Seanna at a hospital - but Ellis predicts that they will have to take leaves of absence from work.

'The only way he's going to thrive is in the arms of his mom,' Ellis said. 'There's no way she can work full time and look after an infant as he goes through all of these surgeries.'

Ellis said she expects that it will take more than a year for her grandson to undergo surgeries and plastic surgery, which should leave him able to walk once he's old enough.

'His fused
 fingers on his left hand need to be separated and straightened, and the
 cleft (gap) where both hands and feet split in utero, will need to be 
surgically closed,' she explained on the site.

She added that his pointer fingers each have an extra bone, which will need to be shaved down.

The
 doctors will carry out the surgery in stages - first focusing on his 
left hand and foot before moving on to his right hand and foot.

It
 means that Ellis wants to raise enough money to help her family as soon
 as she can, and she said she has been overwhelmed by the response from 
family, friends, colleagues and strangers.

'He has so many family members in California that have never had the opportunity to meet him,' she said. 'They decided to take the money they were going to spend on visiting him and put it towards his care instead. That is an amazing gesture.'

After the surgeries and reconstructive procedures, the family will also undergo genetic testing to deduce how likely De Sean is to pass it on to his own children.

The boy's mother, Seanna, had six ultrasounds throughout her pregnancy and the deformity was never detected. Ellis said there is also no family history of the condition.

After the testing - which could cost upwards of $12,000, Ellis said - the family hope to work to spread awareness of the condition in his community and further afield.

'We've got a long road ahead of us but De Sean has the most amazing parents and is surrounded by so much love,' Ellis said. 'When I look at him, I don't see difference, I see ability. He's going to thrive and how cool is that?'

The family has a U.S. Bank account under the name 'Baby De Sean Fund' or you can visit the site.
