Oxford is the second worst university for social mobility, a new league table claims.

It is among elite universities judged to be poor at propelling underprivileged students into top graduate jobs.

Michael Brown, former vice-chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University, who compiled the list, said that ‘brand value’ was not everything. He called for all students to be taught job skills such as project management.

The rankings were labelled ‘strange’ by the Russell Group of 24 top universities, most of which came in the bottom half of the table. Oxford came 152nd out of 153 and Cambridge was 135th, while the School of Pharmacy in London came top.

Professor Brown said top universities had done badly mainly because most of their students are already from wealthy backgrounds.

Many less selective institutions are ‘doing a remarkable and better job’, he said, and Government policy should focus on careers as well as admissions for poorer children.

A Russell Group spokesman said the table put a lower value on students who chose to do a PhD and only looked at professional success six months after graduating.

In a report for the CentreForum liberal think-tank, Professor Brown devised a ranking which shows how well universities help poorer students land top jobs after graduating.

Professor Brown said Russell Group universities ‘do not fare well’, mainly because most of their students are drawn from the wealthiest social groups.

But he also found that ‘many “less-selective” universities with wider ranges of student backgrounds’ are ‘doing a remarkable and better job of developing their graduates into professional employment’.

Professor Brown said Government policy had focused too narrowly on increasing the number of disadvantaged pupils getting to university in the first place, without considering how well they fare after leaving.

These students often lacked the contacts and know-how of their middle-class peers which helped them land professional jobs.

‘In terms of graduation performance and employment outcomes students from areas of high disadvantage have a lower success rate than those from more advantaged backgrounds,’ said Professor Brown.

‘And despite the political focus on access to Russell Group universities, the most selective institutions do not necessarily deliver the best professional graduate outcomes for disadvantaged students either. It is time to raise the game.’

He called on the Government to rank universities officially using a table similar to his own.

But Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group, said it rejected the findings of the report, branding its methods ‘strange’.

‘For example, it puts a lower value on graduates who decide to carry on their studies - thereby suggesting that doing a masters or getting a PhD does not represent a step up the social ladder.

‘It fails, too, to recognise that those students from more disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to complete their degree at a Russell Group university than they are at other institutions.’

‘Finally, it takes only a snapshot of graduates’ jobs six months after they’ve left university. What graduates are doing six months after graduation is not a very good indicator of how much upward mobility they will achieve over a lifetime.

‘In fact, graduates from Russell Group universities go on to earn more than other graduates, are more likely to be in high-skilled jobs and earn 24 per cent more per hour than their peers from other universities.’
