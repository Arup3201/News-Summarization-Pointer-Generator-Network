Paul Bagnall, 18, died after he tried to re-enact a Tudor hanging at his family home in Orpington, Kent

An A Level student who died while trying on costumes for a school play had been trying to re-enact a Tudor hanging, an inquest heard today.

Banker's son Paul Bagnall, 18, was looking for a costume to wear in his parents' loft when the tragedy happened at the family home in Orpington, Kent.

He was discovered by his mother Sandrine, 44, when she returned home at 4pm on 7 January and the inquest heard she initially thought it was a dummy placed there as a joke.

Paul, a prefect at Darrick Wood School in Orpington, was wearing tights, a white ruffled shirt and a belt.

Mrs Bagnall, 44, said: 'I thought it was actually a dummy hanging there and not Paul because it looked smaller than him.

'Then I realised there had been an accident.

'He had no problems, lots of friends and was looking forward to going to university. He was the sweetest, nicest boy.'

'We think he had tried to stage a Tudor hanging. The combination of tights and a laminate floor could have caused him to slip.

'He wasn’t a daredevil, but he took risks if he thought he was being careful.'

In her statement read out at the inquest in Croydon, she said Paul had recently been on a trip to the Hampton Court archives and that his banker father Nick had been telling him about ancient Tudor rituals.

She said: 'Nick told Paul that in Tudor times they used to tie prisoners up by their necks.

'Paul had said he needed a costume to act in a play at a fancy dress party at the end of his school ski trip in February.

'He was studying Tudor history for his A Levels, which explains how he was dressed when he was found.'

She added: 'We had a dressing up box in the loft, and Paul and his sister Lauren regularly used to dress up in the school holidays in different costumes and accessories, on the spur of the moment.'

Much loved son: Paul's mother Sandrine Bagnall, 44, told the inquest her son was 'the sweetest, nicest boy'

There was a step ladder next to him, but Mrs Bagnall said Paul often used it so he could look in the mirror when he had costumes on.

She said: 'It was not unusual for him to do that.

'Paul used to check his costume in the wardrobe mirror, which would explain where he was facing when he died.

'I’ve no idea how long he was up there.'

Mrs Bagnall said she tried to get her son down and called paramedics, but he was pronounced dead 45 minutes later.

The inquest heard the teenager had sat an exam earlier that day, but was not being bullied or under any stress.

The cause of death was given as hanging.

The A Level student was found by his mother, and despite her calling paramedics, he was pronounced dead 45 minutes later

South London coroner Dr Roy Palmer said there were no drugs or alcohol found in Paul’s body when he died.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, he said: 'I’m satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Paul was in the loft searching around in the dressing up box and looking at himself in the mirror when he somehow slipped and gave in to an untimely death.

'I’m so very sorry it happened, and that you lost your son so tragically.'

Paul spoke fluent French, played rugby for his school’s first team, and had been offered a place to study mechanical engineering in Southampton.

His father, Nick, 57, added: 'He was a great boy and much loved by everyone who knew him. He was a great son and brother to his sister - a wonderful boy who did not have a bad bone in his body.

'His teachers said he was a natural mathematician and used to help his friends out with their work.

'Despite being a bit clumsy, through determination he became a good rugby player and a black belt in karate.

'He was always smiling. Even when he was in a karate bout he would be beaming - that’s the kind of person he was. He will be missed by so many people.'

School principal Barbara Rhymaun described Paul as 'An exceptional student who was very popular amongst staff and students alike.'
