While many will be looking forward to embracing the new year, for some 2014 is already a washout.

For some people living in Gloucestershire, already the new year has brought bad news, after heavy rain caused a landslip and made the B4058 from Nailsworth to Horsley near Stroud impassable.

Gloucestershire Highways is investigating the site, which has already had some corrective work done earlier in 2013, after an embankment collapsed.

Highways crews have placed sandbags on the road to protect the properties below from debris sliding down the embankment.

Torrential overnight rain led to a land slide at Horsley road. Tons of earth moved down the bank towards some cottages

The road will be closed until at least February 2014 after the torrential rain washed away huge chunks of mud across the path

Meanwhile, families in two households 
have been asked whether they can stay with friends or relatives as a 
precautionary measure while workers relieve pressure on the landslip.

Investigations
 could reveal some further corrective work, due to take place in the New
 Year, needs to be brought forward in response to changes in the area.

Councillor
 Vernon Smith, Gloucestershire county council cabinet member for floods,
 said: "This site was already being monitored closely and work was 
underway to correct previous issues.

'The heavy rain has meant some 
slight changes to the embankment and, as a precaution, we have had to 
close the road and make sure the surrounding area is safe.

'As soon as the road has been investigated further we will be able to look at what action needs to be taken.'

 spokesman from the Met Office said: 'Party goers in the north west, 
southern and western areas will need to take a brolly tonight as there 
will be showers. Other parts of the country will stay dry at midnight.'

However, as the hangovers set in, New Year's Day looks set to be a washout as forecasters predict downpours and strong winds.

Forecasters
 have today issued a severe weather warning for rain, saying as much as 
40mm could fall throughout the day.

They added coastal areas and higher 
ground could be hit with gales of 50-60mph.

Weather experts say the latest wave of
 bad weather is set to push in from the Atlantic tomorrow, crossing the 
UK from west to east and southern England and South Wales will be the heaviest hit.

Met
 Office spokesman Dan Williams said: 'There is a big band of rain that 
will bring persistent rain to most parts of the UK through the day on 
Wednesday.

'It will be a pretty wet and windy day. 

'It won’t be on a par with the winds we’ve seen in some of the recent storms, but exposed areas of the western coast and some of the south coast will see speeds of 50 to 60mph.

'There could be a fair amount of rain in the south and south west of England, with 10-20mm falling fairly widely, and up to 40mm in coast areas.'

Land
 sodden from the Christmas storms is expected to struggle to cope with 
further rainfall.

Councils are preparing for the worst, with emergency accommodation lined up in case people are forced to leave their homes.

The Local Government Association is urging people to look on council websites to keep updated with information.

The agency said there was a 
continued risk of flooding, particularly in the south west of England, 
as rivers respond to heavy rainfall.

A
 spokesman said: 'On New Year’s Day, heavy rain is expected which could 
cause flooding to communities in the south east and south west of 
England.

'There is a heightened flood risk for parts of south east, southern and south west England and Cumbria.

'The
 Environment Agency is urging communities to prepare in advance by 
signing up for free flood warnings and to take action if they receive 
one.

The agency has eight flood warnings in place in England and Wales, meaning flooding
 is expected, and 112 flood alerts, where flooding is possible.

The
 agency said it had teams on the ground 'around the clock' operating 
pumping stations, issuing flood warnings and checking that flood banks, 
walls and barriers are working effectively.

It
 said: 'People travelling this week are also reminded to check the 
latest flood updates ahead of making journeys and should not drive 
through dangerous floodwater.'

The Environment Agency spokesman said there have been 
1,300 properties flooded across England.

They added their defences 
have protected more than 80,000 properties.

Thousands of people across the UK are 
still recovering after last weeks' storms, which caused widespread misery - with 
power cuts and flooding ruining Christmas for scores of families.

Seven people were airlifted to safety yesterday after heavy rain caused flooding in Scotland.

The
 group, which included four children, were rescued from a farmhouse near
 Closeburn in Thornhill, Dumfries and Galloway, by a Royal Navy 
helicopter after rain forced families to be evacuated from dozens of 
homes and caused major road disruption.

Around
 40 houses in Kirkconnel, Dumfries and Galloway, were evacuated, as were
 25 in Dumfries after the River Nith burst its banks, flooding the 
Whitesands area.

The heavy 
rain also caused problems on the roads, with the A76 at Kirkconnel 
closed and flooding on the A74 and A75, and a landslide on the A7 just 
south of Langholm closed the road for a short while.

Meanwhile, the poor weather didn't put everyone off celebrating the turn of the new year.
