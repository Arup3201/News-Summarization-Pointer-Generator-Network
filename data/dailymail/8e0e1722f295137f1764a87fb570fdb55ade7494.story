Malik told the Mumbai police: 'Being a Muslim woman, she should not have worn such a short dress.'

According to The Independent Malik was arrested and charged with molestation under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code.

Exactly how Malik managed to get close to Khan remains a mystery as security during the song competition was extremely tight.

Despite crowds of 2,500 and 250 guards being present in the studio, Malik was about to break through a cordon and confront Khan as she was being escorted from the venue.
