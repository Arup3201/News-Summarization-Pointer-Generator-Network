A group of firefighters are being investigated after they allegedly took a 'straw poll' on Facebook about the the female colleagues they would most like to sleep with.

The controversy at the Queensland Fire Service is believed to have originated earlier in 2014 when the male officers used the social media platform as a means of rating female officers' potential sexual prowess, with one being likened to supermodel Elle McPherson.

Several female officers are understood to have been transferred as a result of the harassment, after a complaint was lodged with the commissioner.

The controversy is believed to have originated earlier in 2014 when male officers in the department used the social media platform as a means of rating female officers' potential sexual prowess.

Further allegations have plagued the department, with one officer allegedly being portrayed as Adolf Hitler, and another female officer being portrayed as Elle McPherson, reported The Courier Mail. 

Assistant Commissioner Peter Beauchamp initiated an investigation into the claims, and an independent workplace investigation firm has been employed to question the officers involved in the incident.  

The allegations in question relate to “sexual harassment, workplace bullying, harassment and intimidation”. 

Three officers may potentially face dismissal or disciplinary charges over the scandal, though none have been stood down as of yet. 

A spokesperson for the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said that it would be inappropriate to comment upon the matter as the incident was still under investigation.

However, one officer saw fit to comment.

'You could say it’s a real hotbed of scandal in the fire service at the moment,' they said.

The United Firefighters Union is allegedly providing support to the Queensland Fire Service, as the investigation explore claims of breaches of the state's fire service code.
