Disney star Zendaya has been chosen as the face of Madonna’s Material Girl clothing line for the second season in a row, having made her debut for the label in fall 2014.

In the brand’s newest ads, the 18-year-old models flirty looks from the label's spring 2015 collection at New York City's Bleecker Street Music store, while posing with a vinyl record of Madonna's classic 1984 album Like a Virgin.

'Shooting this campaign was so much fun! I love the new Material Girl collection; it's all about bold pieces that you can mix and match,' Zendaya said of the range, which was designed by Madonna and her 18-year-old daughter Lourdes.

'All of the looks are girly with a little bit of tough edge to it, very much like my own style!'

The teen singing sensation also professed her admiration for the 56-year-old pop icon, admitting she was a bit starstruck.

'First of all Madonna knows who I am, check. Bucket list, I’m over. That’s all I need,' Zendaya said.

She added: 'When Madonna Instagrammed a picture of me I think I died, came back to life again, then I had a party, and then I died again, came back again, went to heaven, said hello to everybody, came back down, and here I am. It was crazy, it was awesome.'

Like mother, like daughter: Madonna and her daughter Lourdes, 18, said that Zendaya 'personifies the Material Girl' in a statement

But she added: 'Don’t think it’s going to happen because I have a lot of new Material Girl items but a girl can try!'

Madonna and Lourdes reciprocated Zendaya's admiration in a statement on the new campaign: 'Zendaya personifies the Material Girl, she loves to have fun and is constantly experimenting with trends. Her daring personal style and high energy made her the perfect face for our new collection.'

The mother-daughter duo launched Material Girl, named for the singer's 1984 hit, in 2010, when Lourdes was 13.

'I think this line is absolutely an extension of her taste,' Madonna said at the time. 'We like to combine … a plaid or a flannel with a lace, or leather with lace or rhinestones. So we mix and match textures and fabrics and elements that are both masculine and feminine.'

The clothing line is available exclusively at Macy's.
