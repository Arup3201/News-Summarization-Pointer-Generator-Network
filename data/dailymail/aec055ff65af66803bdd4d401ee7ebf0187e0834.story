The Spanish ambassador to the UK has been summoned by the Foreign Office after one of the country’s research vessels entered British territory off the coast of Gibraltar.

Foreign Office minister David Lidington said the actions of the research ship, which was accompanied by a Spanish Civil Guard vessel, were 'unlawful'.

Mr Lidington urged the Spanish government to take action on the recent increase in vessels in British waters off Gibraltar and said he 'strongly condemned this provocative incursion.'

‘According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the waters around Gibraltar are indisputably British territorial waters, under United Kingdom sovereignty, in which only the United Kingdom has the right to exercise jurisdiction,’ Mr Lidington told the Telegraph.

‘Her Majesty's Government takes a grave view of any attempt by Spain to exert authority or control within British Gibraltar territorial waters and considers such incursions as a violation of our sovereignty,'

Earlier this year a Spanish warship had to be escorted off British territory by Gibraltar Squadron's patrol boat, HMS Sabre, after it entered the waters near Gibraltar.

The boat allegedly used a fake name and call sign, and refused to leave by its own accord at it claimed it was in Spanish waters, local media said.

The vessel approached as UK Special Forces personnel from the Royal Navy's Submarine Parachute Assistance Group were carrying out training jumps into the sea.

Tensions over the disputed territory 
have been rising since the construction of an artificial reef by the 
Gibraltar government last year which the Spanish said interfered with 
their fishermen.

Madrid responded by imposing tighter border controls, leading to long delays at the frontier, while the Gibraltar Chief Minister has warned that Spanish vessels entering British territory may come under fire as they are not identified as being from ‘a friendly nation'.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme in November last year, Fabian Picardo warned that Spanish boats ‘may find themselves shot at’ if they continue to disregard Gibraltar’s marine borders.

Warning
 that the Spanish ships could be seen as ‘terrorists’ he accused the 
country of ‘needling away at the United Kingdom and Gibraltar by taking 
such action’.

A
 Foreign Office spokesman said at the time: 'There was an incursion into British 
waters near Gibraltar by the Spanish Navy on 18 February, during a Royal
 Navy exercise. The exercise went ahead irrespective of this incursion.

'We are raising this at a high level with the Spanish government and will be issuing a formal protest.

'Neither this incident nor other incursions change the fact of UK sovereignty over British Gibraltar Territorial Waters.'

Tensions have been high in the region since the summer when Spain imposed border checks on every car causing up to six hours of delays

The 
long-standing dispute between Britain and Spain has flared up over the 
past years. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has blocked the 
Spanish-Gibraltarian border and staged numerous incursions into 
Gibraltarian waters.

In November, a research vessel belonging to the Spanish 
state, the RV Ramon Margalef, undertook significant surveying activity 
in Gibraltar’s territorial waters.

The
 boat withdrew only after Spanish ambassador Federico Trillo was 
summoned by Matthew Rycroft, Acting Permanent Under Secretary at the 
Foreign Office 20 hours later– the third time he has been summoned over Gibraltar 
since the current Spanish government took office in December 2011.

In
 the same month, a British diplomatic bag was opened and searched by 
Spanish Guardia Civil officers on the border with Gibraltar - an 
incident the Foreign Office described as a 'serious infringement' of 
international diplomatic protocols.

At the time Europe Minister David Lidington said Spain has increased the number of its incursions into 
British territorial waters from around five per month to around 40 per 
month.
