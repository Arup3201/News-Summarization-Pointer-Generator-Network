His adopted son and godson Chris Davison, 62, paid tribute to the pilot, who he had looked after since the death of Diana aged 86 last year.

Chris said: 'So many people say to me what a legend Tony was but it is important to remember what a great man he was too.

'It is easy to get carried away with all his achievements and miss out on his kindness, his loyalty and his humility.

'He was an incredible man and now is the time to celebrate the fascinating life he led.

'We will miss him but his spirit and legacy will live on in so many people.

'It was an honour to have been Tony's wingman for a little while.'
