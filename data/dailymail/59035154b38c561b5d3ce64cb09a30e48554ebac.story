A subsidiary of chocolate bar-maker Mars has been sponsoring savage bear-baiting contests in in Ukraine, an animal charity's investigation has revealed.

Video taken by activists shows tape branded with the name Royal Canin being used at a competition which took place earlier this year near Vinnytsia, at the heart of the Eastern European country.

The French pet food company, which was bought by Mars around a decade ago, said it was 'horrified' to learn that it had sponsored the brutal contest.

Savage: Hunting dogs attack a chained brown bear in a bear-baiting contest in Ukraine, which an animal charity's investigation revealed was sponsored by the pet food subsidiary of global food giant Mars

Footage released by international animal welfare group Four Paws shows an event staged in woods where several dogs are set on a chained brown bear as a small audience of men look on.

The animal has had its claws removed and its movements controlled by several men tugging on the chain, stopping it from mounting an effective defence against the dogs, which continually bite and harry the animal.

Eventually the panicked bear begins to foam at the mouth from exhaustion and fear. The video shows a table laden with Royal Canin-branded trophies for the most aggressive dogs in the competition.

Royal Canin, which makes food for cats and dogs, promotes itself with the slogan 'respecting the animal nature of dogs and cats'.

But the evidence gathered by Four Paws will horrify animal lovers. The charity says it has evidence that Royal Canin has sponsored more than one bear-baiting contest.

International animal welfare group Four Paws captured footage of the event near Vinnytsia, central Ukraine, earlier this year. Brown bears are legally protected in the country but are often victims of cruel treatment

Dr Amir Khalil, a vet and project leader for the charity, speaking to The Observer, questioned Royal Canin's stated commitment to animal wellbeing.

'By sponsoring bear-baiting, Royal Canin is reducing wild animals like the brown bear to the rank of second-class animals,' he said.

Four Paws has a memorandum of understanding with the Ukrainian government's department of ecology to eradicate bear baiting. Nevertheless, such contests still take place between four and six times a year, the organisation said.

Although brown bears are, on paper, legally protected in the country, it has for a long time faced accusations of cruelty towards the animals, which are often forced to perform in Ukrainian zoos and circuses.

'Cruel lives': There are estimated to be between 15 and 20 baiting bears in Ukraine. They are taken from their mothers at just a few months old, their claws are removed and they are kept most of the time in small cages

'Humbling': A Royal Canin branded trophy, to be awarded to the owners of the dogs judged to be the bravest. The company said it had taken action to cease its sponsorship of the events after it was alerted to its involvement

There are estimated to be between 15 and 20 baiting bears in Ukraine, according to Four Paws.

A spokesman for the charity said: 'They live cruel lives in tiny cages with nothing but a concrete floor, and they are only released from these cages for training or to be attacked by hunting dogs.

'They are usually given insufficient food and water, to make them weaker opponents for the dogs.'

Whether sourced from zoos, circuses or the wild, most baiting bears are snatched from their mothers at just a few months old. Most undergo a painful procedure to have their claws removed.

Four Paws said Royal Canin had admitted to its involvement in the contest.

In a statement to The Observer, the company said: 'Royal Canin has been absolutely horrified to see these images linked with our brand. The sponsorship of this event is not consistent with Royal Canin's animal welfare policy, our philosophy of pet-first or our vision.'

Royal Canin said that after Four Paws alerted it to the 'humbling' incident in May it had taken immediate action to cease its sponsorship of bear-baiting contests.

MailOnline contacted Mars UK for comment, but at the time of writing was still awaiting a response.
