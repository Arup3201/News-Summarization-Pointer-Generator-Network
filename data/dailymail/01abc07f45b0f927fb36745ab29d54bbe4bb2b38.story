Millions of struggling families across the U.S. will be hit with more financial woes over the holidays when food stamp benefits are reduced in November.

The food stamp plan, called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, will be reducing its benefits as of November 1 because the financial boost it received during the recession-era is expiring.

SNAP helps over 23 million U.S. households, totaling around 48 million people, which has steadily increased over recent years due to a weak economy and high unemployment.

The average monthly benefit per household is $275, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

This amount could drop by around $36 less per month after November 1.

Exact cuts in benefits will depend on each household’s situation, but the $36 is based on a family of four with no other changes in circumstances, according to the USDA.

‘For those of us who spend $1.70 a day on a latte, this doesn’t seem like a big change, but it does kind of really highlight that millions of families are living on an extremely modest food budget’, VP for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities told NBCnews.com.

The cuts will bring the benefits back in line to where they were in the mid-2000s, before being boosted during the recession.

The aim for lawmakers is to slash their SNAP budget over years to come – with a bill passed in September by the House of Representatives to save $39 billion from SNAP over the next decade.

This might see some families being cut from the program completely.

Associate professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition at Tuffs University said: 'That's neither great, nor terrible.

‘We have a very spare-cash based safety net and we rely a lot on food stamps to give people the resources they need to avoid hunger.
