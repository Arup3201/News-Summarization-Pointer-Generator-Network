A 16-year-old girl is fighting for her life in hospital after being sexually assaulted, beaten and thrown into a frigid river in Canada, police have said. 

Rinelle Harper, a student at Southeast College in Winnipeg, was reportedly attacked as she walked along Assiniboine River, near the city's Midtown Bridge, last Friday night.

She was allegedly subjected to a 'serious sexual assault' - the exact details of which remain unknown - before being hurled into the cold water and left for dead.

Scene: Miss Harper was reportedly attacked as she walked along the river (pictured), near the city's Midtown Bridge, last Friday night.She was found lying unconscious on the ground at 7am on Saturday by a passerby

She was found only at 7am the next day by a passerby, who discovered her lying unconscious beside the river, just east of the bridge. It is unknown how the teenager got out of the water.

Paramedics were called to the scene and Miss Harper was taken to hospital, according to CTV Winnipeg. She remains in a critical, but stable, condition. Her attacker remains at large.

On Monday, Miss Harper's aunt, Holly, told the news station the entire family was shocked by the 'brutal' assault on her niece, who is from the Lake Narrows community.

'I can't even imagine what would provoke such an attack, such as brutal attack on my niece. Who in their right mind would do something so horrible?' she said. 

She added that doctors had initially thought Miss Harper was going to die, while the police's homicide unit were instructed to start investigating the incident.

Shocked: On Monday, police took the rare move of releasing Miss Harper's name, with the consent of her family. Above, Supt Danny Smyth told a press conference he was 'appalled by the viciousness of the attack'

However, the teenager - who is originally from Garden Hill, a remote First Nations community in northern Manitoba - is battling through and it is now believed she will survive, she said. 

'She has a lot of support around her, a lot of love and support and people praying for her,' Ms Harper told CBC News. 'We want whoever is responsible to be held accountable for this.' 

On Monday, police took the rare move of releasing Miss Harper's name - with the consent of her family - in the hope that the violent nature of the attack would 'resonate' with the public.

Killed: It comes just three months after the body of another aboriginal girl - Tina Fontaine (pictured), 15 - was found wrapped in a bag in Manitoba's Red River

'As a member of the community myself, I'm appalled by the viciousness of this attack,' Winnipeg Police Superintendent Danny Smyth said in a press conference. 

'It's important that people are aware that this is an unacceptable attack on our youth and we're hopeful that this will resonate with the community and  that people will come forward and help us.'  

Under Canadian law, survivors of sexual attacks - as well as minors who commit or are the victims of crimes - are typically not identified.

It comes just three months after the body of another aboriginal girl - Tina Fontaine, 15 - was found wrapped in a bag in Manitoba's Red River. 

Both cases are being investigated separately. 

Miss Harper, whose high school caters for aboriginal students and is owned and operated by nine northern Manitoba First Nations, was allegedly attacked after she got separated from her friends.

At the time, she was wearing black leggings, white runners, a dark-coloured North Face hooded jacket and a black 'WUTANG' hoodie, police said.

She is described as being 5ft 8ins tall, 180 pounds with dark brown hair past her shoulders.
