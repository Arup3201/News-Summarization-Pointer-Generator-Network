This schoolboy has set his sights on a professional rugby career - despite being born with just one hand.

Ben Seward was born with his right arm missing the wrist and hand but he hasn't let his disability hold him back and has been a keen rugby player since he was just seven-years-old.

The 10-year-old, from Chorley, Lancashire, has a prosthetic hand but due to health and safety concerns he is not allowed to wear it on the pitch and copes with just one hand.

His dream is that when he grows up he can play with his favourite team the Wigan Warriors, pictured

Ben plays winger and centre for Chorley Panthers under 11s and dreams of a career playing for his idols, the Wigan Warriors, when he is older.

He said: 'I have been playing rugby for nearly four years now. I started playing rugby because it was a good way for me to keep fit and it is a team sport so everyone can get involved.

'The thing I love the most about it is that I have made so many new friends and get to meet lots of people.

'My favourite team are the Wigan Warriors and I go to watch all of their home games. I have met a lot of the players too and my favourite player Josh Charnley used to play for the same team as me.

'I go to training camps at Wigan every summer too and have even had the chance to play against some of my favourite players which is really exciting.

'Going to the camps and playing for Chorley Panthers helped me decide that I definitely want to play professionally. My coaches have been amazing and I have improved a lot over the past few years.

'I have two favourite positions, winger and centre. If I play centre then I get to tackle a lot more - sometimes it can be quite scary because there are some really tough players.

'I don't think having one hand holds me back from playing rugby at all, and when I start secondary school in September I am hoping to be able to play for them too one day.'

And Ben isn't the only rugby fan in the family as dad David, 38, is the reason behind the schoolboy's obsession and Carol, David and daughter Kaitlyn, 12, are also season ticket holders.

Mum Carol said that having one hand has never stopped Ben doing anything and that the brave schoolboy rarely wears his prosthetic hand except for 'cosmetic reasons'.

Doctors believe that Ben punched through the lining of the womb causing fibres to wrap around his arm

The 39-year-old teaching assistant said: 'Ben is completely obsessed with rugby - it is his life.

'He isn't allowed to wear his prosthetic hand when he plays because of health and safety as it is quite hard and could harm another player on the pitch.

'But he wouldn't want to as sometimes it just gets in his way and he copes just fine with one hand. He gives it his all.

'He does very well with his rugby and is a very popular member of the team.. He is hoping to play for his high school as well when he starts in September.

'They make no exceptions for him and treat him just like every other child.'

'When he isn't playing it, he is watching it - no matter what team it is or if it is rugby league or rugby union. And he has a season ticket for the Wigan Warriors.'

According to Mrs Seward, the only thing Ben cannot do like his friends  is tie his own shoelaces 

The youngster's disability came as a huge shock to the family after what seemed to be a normal, healthy pregnancy - and his missing limb was only discovered after he was born.

Doctors think it may be a result of Ben punching through the lining of the womb, in the early stages of pregnancy, causing fibres to become wrapped around his right arm.

But the missing limb didn't delay his development and he was walking unaided at just 13-months-old and he has excelled in several sports such as football, rugby and javelin.

Mrs Seward said: 'If there is something Ben can't do, he quickly works out his own way of doing it. He is amazing.

'He is just like any other child and he never uses his arm as an excuse. In fact the only thing Ben can't do is tie his own shoelaces. Everything else, he has a good go at.

'He has had a prosthetic arm since he was just seven-months-old but most of the time it is just a hindrance to him.

'He had a dress arm at first and then had months of training to use a mechanical arm but he doesn't wear a prosthetic often.

'He mainly wears it for cosmetic reasons rather than functional reasons - maybe if he was having a school photo taken or something like that.'
