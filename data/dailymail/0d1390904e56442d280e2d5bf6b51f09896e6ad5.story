Jozy Altidore was by no means prolific in the Premier League, but across the Atlantic he scored two goals on his debut for Toronto on the opening day of the MLS season.

The 25-year-old American scored one goal in 42 Premier League appearances in the red and white of Sunderland, while before that he netted just once in a season-long loan spell at Hull City. 

His time in England concluded with two goals in 70 Premier League matches - against Manchester City and Chelsea, to be fair - but upon returning to the league in which he began his career, Altidore scored twice to help Toronto to a 3-1 victory in their first game of the season.

The US international striker moved to Canada as part of a swap deal with Jermain Defoe, and got off to a flyer in his first game, netting a brace.

Toronto went 1-0 down to Vancouver Whitecaps in the all-Canadian affair, before Altidore scored his first; one touch to take it round the goalkeeper, and one touch to fire home.

Toronto took the lead through Robbie Findley, but Altidore was not finished.

In the latter stages of the game, the former Sunderland man was brought down in the box by Pa Modou Kah, and opted to take the spot-kick himself.

Not content with your average penalty, Altidore's confidence was evident when he produced a Panenka to secure a 3-1 away victory for his side.

His dismal three seasons in English football will have done Altidore's career no favours, but if Saturday's performance is anything to go by, it'll be back on track in no time at all.
