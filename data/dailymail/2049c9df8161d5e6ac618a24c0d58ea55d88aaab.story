Erik Bielderman is a French football writer, columnist and TV pundit.

Nicolas Anelka could have chosen to pay respect to Nelson Mandela. Instead, he chose Dieudonne M'bala M'bala.

To celebrate his first goal in England since August 20, 2011, West Brom’s French striker decided to express his support and friendship for a French  so-called humorist by doing the provocative hand gesture, la quenelle.

Anelka has tried to portray his actions as an innocent anti-establishment action but just think about the timing. 

Controversy: This gesture, performed by Dieubonne and Anelka, has landed the striker in hot water

In the latest sickening episode involving Dieudonne, he made these comments on stage about Patrick Cohen, a French radio journalist: ‘When I hear him (Cohen), I tell myself, you know, gas chamber . . . too bad.’

After a video emerged of the incident, the French government issued a statement saying it would take every legal action possible to ban Dieudonne’s shows and public meetings in the future.

This story was headline news in the French media on the  morning of West Brom’s match against West Ham, which was shown live on Canal+ in France.

In the past two days, the vast majority of the French public have expressed disgust at his actions but a minority of French  citizens still believe la quenelle is anti-Zionist — and not anti-Semitic. These people have used the internet and Twitter to paint Dieudonne and Anelka as  victims of the political and media worlds.

Anelka’s supporters ask why French 
society and the  government did not react with similar outrage when la 
quenelle was made by Liverpool’s Mamadou Sakho, judo world champion 
Teddy Riner and French-born basketball star Tony Parker — who last night
 apologised for making the gesture.

An important distinction is that these gestures were made in private, not a sporting arena.

They also ask why nothing  happened when
 Mathieu Deplagne, a French Ligue 1 player from Sochaux, did la 
quenelle on the field after scoring last January?

By making his gesture on the pitch, 
Anelka knew that in France the reaction would be huge. Wasn’t the 
political climate heavy enough?

His action was also provocative towards English football’s rulers and FIFA, who prohibit expression of political, social or religious issues on the football stage.

They were also provocative in the 
context of a French society which is focusing on the integration debate.
 Months before the local and European elections are held, the Front 
National looks as if they could become the largest political party in 
France in terms of voters.  Unemployment and immigration are among the 
most sensitive themes in the political campaign.

Despite the bitter atmosphere in 
France around these  questions for many years now, Dieudonne remained in
 a relative shadow and was regarded as an underground agitator.

Even
 if he claims to have around 426,000 'likes' on Facebook and 43,000 
followers on Twitter, Dieudonne and his quenelle had not received a  
significant public airing.

Now,
 thanks to Anelka, it is on the front pages in France and is being 
discussed by everyone. Dieudonne could not have wished for better 
publicity for his views.

Anelka portrays himself as an anti-establishment hero but this is an anti-establishment hero who is pictured emerging from his Rolls-Royce at the entrance to London Heliport and has appeared in an advert in France for the hamburger restaurant chain ‘Quick’.

When West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football.

But the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland.

Here, we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala:
