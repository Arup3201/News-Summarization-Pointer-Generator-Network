Erik Lamela turned 23 on Wednesday and the midfielder was able to celebrate his birthday in the 'best way' after Tottenham beat Swansea 3-2 at White Hart Lane.

The Argentina international took to social media after the match on to thank everyone who had wished him happy returns, insisting that the victory was the perfect way to end the day.

The Spurs midfielder, who was an unused substitute for the Premier League clash, uploaded a picture to his Instagram and Twitter accounts of him holding two massive balloons displaying his age.

Lamela wrote: 'Thank you very much to everyone who greeted me on my birthday... Winning makes me finish it in the best way!!' 

Earlier on Wednesday striker Roberto Soldado wished  his team-mate happy birthday and posted a picture of the pair on Twitter in the build up to the Swans game.

Nacer Chadli, Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend fired Mauricio Pochettino's side to victory - their first in six games - against Swansea as Tottenham remained in the hunt for a top four finish.

Ki Sung-yueng equalised in the first half before former Spurs midfielder Gylfi Sigursson scored late on to give the home side a scare in the closing minutes.

It was the perfect way to respond after the club were dumped out of the Europa League last week by Fiorentina before suffering Wembley heartache as Chelsea emerged triumphant in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday.
