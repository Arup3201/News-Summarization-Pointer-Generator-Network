Claire Richards has famously battled 
with her weight over the years, fluctuating between size 10 and size 20. 
But at size 14, she is finally feeling body confident.

The former Steps star was so keen to prove that fuller-figured women can look and feel both fabulous and fashionable that she designed her very own range of plus-size clothing.

It was such a success that the 36-year-old is back with a second range for Fashion World and she promises her collection is a 'treasure trove of essential wardrobe staples to see you through the summer season in style'.

Fashion first: Pop star Claire Richards has designed a new plus-size range for Fashion World and hopes women will wear it and embrace their curves

Speaking about her new range, she told MailOnline: 'Working with Fashion World gave me a real opportunity to create a collection which is stylish and flattering for real women’s bodies. 

'I was totally inspired by my love of vintage styles and old school Hollywood glamour. I think that era particularly appeals to me as it was a time when clothes were designed for women with curves. 

'The old school starlets had boobs and bums, so it was all about accentuating the waist, which I think is really important to complement a figure.

'There’s nothing more feminine than seeing a woman in a fabulously figure-hugging frock showing off her shape.'

Casual comfort: Claire promises that from family weddings to weekend wear, her new range offers an outfit for every occasion (kimono top £25)

Claire’s new collection features vintage styles which promise to flatter the female form.

Highlights include a sheath dress with Chinoiserie embroidery, a floral prom dress with mesh sleeves that flatter the arms and a pair of high-waisted jeans with plaited belt detailing. 

Claire promises that from family weddings to weekend wear, her new range offers an outfit for every occasion.

At the beginning of last year Claire revealed that she finally felt 
happy with herself.

Dressing up: Claire has used tailoring tricks to make flattering occasion wear (left, tweed dress £75, right, embroidered  dress, £75)

She told the MailOnline: 'Make the most of your curves, don't hide them. I'm all about the curves.'

When asked if she felt comfortable in her own skin Claire replied: 'Absolutely, but it has taken me a long time.'

She added: 'A lot of that has to do with the public perception of me.'

It looks set to be an exciting year 
for Claire as on Thursday she shared a picture of herself in the studio 
which she captioned: ‘Clara in the studio again!!! Yay xx’

Body confident: Claire recently told MailOnline: 'Make the most of your curves, don't hide them. I'm all about the curves' (frill sleeve blouse, £28)

And when asked by one of her followers whether she was working on her own album or one with Steps, she replied: ‘My own album x’

Back
 in 2012 Claire and her former band-mates - Ian 'H' Watkins, Lisa 
Scott-Lee, Faye Tozer and Lee Latchford-Evans - reunited for a four-part
 Sky Living documentary after initially splitting in 2001.

The group’s Greatest Hits album reached number one in the UK album chart in late 2011, and the band toured the UK through 2012.

And she isn't the only former popstar keen to transform women's wardrobes.

Former Atomic Kitten singer Liz McClarnon has also joined forces with Fashion World to design a range of boutique swimwear.

The 32-year-old's collection features kitsch prints and pops of colour, which she hopes will be perfect for any pool or beach holiday.

She wants in too! Liz McClarnon, former Atomic Kitten star, has also designed a range with Fashion World but focused on swimwear (£26)

Happy holidays! Liz says there are matching kaftans in three colourways which are the perfect cover-up to take you from your sunbed to the poolside bar (left, £30, right, £38)

Speaking about the collaboration, Liz said: 'It is such a thrill to be working with Fashion World.

'I'm often asked for fashion advice from friends and people I meet and for a long time I've wanted to create the ultimate swimwear collection that is not only stylist and fun but ensures its wearer feels confident on the beach (somewhere we can all feel self-conscious!).

'We've created a range which features three styles – a bikini, swimsuit and a swimdress in three funky colourways. 

'The swimsuit has removable straps to avoid ugly tan lines but are available for those who want support. The bikini bottoms have side drawstrings so you can choose the level of coverage - it's a feature you don't always see and is more flattering as it helps balance the size of your hips.

'I love the prints and wanted the collection to have a bit of a 50s vibe so the cherries, flamingos and daisies fit the bill. 

'There
 are matching kaftans in three colourways which are the perfect cover-up
 to take you from your sunbed to the poolside bar (Pina Coladas all 
round!).'
