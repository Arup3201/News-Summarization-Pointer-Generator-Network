It seemed a very daunting yuletide challenge; could I find an exciting, quality array of presents to satisfy even the most fussy of school children for a total of just $150?

In previous years, shopping for our two children, aged four and six, is usually done in bursts of frenzied grabs at our local mall between food shopping and scavenging around for presents for teachers.

In short, I've probably over spent amid the rush and my lack of planning and regretting it in January when the credit card bill lands heavily in the mailbox.

A Daily Mail reporter was sent on a quest to find a quality array of presents to satisfy school children for a total of $150. The cheapest being board game Line Up 4, at Kmart, for $6 

Other potential gifts include Mr Tickle (left) ceramic mug with toffees, Coles, $5 and Mini Movie Collection (right), Despicable Me & Despicable Me 2, Coles, $5

61 Key Kids Keyboard, ALDI, which costs $16.99 was the most expensive Christmas present on the list

It's the same financial hangover for many, with shoppers predicted by the Australian National Retailers Association to spend at least $6.5 billion in the shops this year and a further billion on online gifts.

So this venture for Daily Mail Australia was quite the revelation. 

I had a strict budget and a tight deadline; it was time to switch off my phone for once and focus. 

And in just a few hours at Westfield Southland, in Cheltenham which is southeast of Melbourne, I was amazed to find an exciting mix of presents in many of the major stores including Target, Big W, Kmart, ALDI, Coles and Rebel Sport.

Rather than just diving into the toy aisles and aiming mindlessly for the well known expensive brands, the exercise made me also look carefully in the less obvious areas such as sports and camping. 

And what gems I found, many of which may well inspire the whole family during the lengthy summer school holidays. 

The Inflatable raft boat with oars, which can be found at Kmart, retailing for $15

Wilson tennis balls (left), Rebel Sport, $8 for five and Piping Hot Bodyboard, Target, for $8

Pulse portable mini Bluetooth speaker (left), Big W, $15 and Cupcake Maker (right), Target, $12

Zinc scooter, Target, which usually retails for $19 but currently has 20 per cent off which brings the cost down to $15.20

1) Kid's Science Metal Detector, Kmart, $20

2) 61 Key Kids Keyboard, ALDI, $16.99

3) Zinc scooter, Target, (usually $19 but currently has 20 per cent off) $15.20

4) Pulse portable mini Bluetooth speaker, Big W, $15

5) Line Up 4, Kmart, $6

6) Mini Movie Collection, Despicable Me & Despicable Me 2, Coles, $5

7) Height Adjustable Tennis, Big W, $12

8) Cupcake Maker, Target, $12

9) Kids Sport Fishing Rod, Kmart, $10

10) Piping Hot Bodyboard, Target, $8

11) Wilson tennis balls x5, Rebel Sport, $8

12) Mr Tickle ceramic mug with toffees, Coles,  $5

13) Inflatable raft boat with oars, Kmart, $15

TOTAL: $148.19

From inflatable boats and keyboards to cup cake makers and fishing rods. 

All suitable for both boys and girls, with the added benefits of several prices reduced as the major stores compete fiercely for our Christmas dollars.

It soon became clear sticking to a strict budget doesn't mean a dreary Christmas for the children. 

Far from it. 

These gifts will mean a huge pile of presents to unwrap and may even turn into some fun new hobbies. 

The metal detector gift alone will potentially amuse the kids for hours at the beach.

It also turned out some major retailers are doing their own brand version of classic toys such as Connect Four - at quarter of the price. 

Particularly Kmart with their 'Line Up 4' game at just $6.

Our children may just have their best Christmas (and school holidays) yet.
