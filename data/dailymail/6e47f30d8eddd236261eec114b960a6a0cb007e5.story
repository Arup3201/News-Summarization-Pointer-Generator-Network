Chris Hughton says that the FA are now serious about increasing the number of black and ethnic minority managers in football – but he wants to see substantive results in terms of appointments rather than good intentions.

Hughton, who with Chris Powell and Keith Curle is one of only three black managers in the game, despite 25 per cent of players coming from black and minority backgrounds, takes on Arsenal in the FA Cup on Sunday having been appointed by Brighton at the turn of the year.

And the former Norwich manager said: ‘I see a real enthusiasm from the stakeholders in our game, the PFA, certainly the FA and the LMA to address some of the imbalances. I think we're seeing an upturn in the number of black and ethnic potential coaches wanting to participate in courses and that's certainly a way to go. But it's about transparency as well, making sure that black and ethnic coaches are in a position to be interviewed for jobs and of course getting transparency in feedback from clubs.

‘As I said, there's a real enthusiasm and it's how you act upon that. If we're hearing things like that from the FA, then it's their responsibility to see that that comes into practice.’

But Hughton is not a supporter of the ‘Rooney Rule’, a stipulation by the NFL in the USA the football teams had to interview at least one minority candidate for any coaching position to increase diversity.

‘I understand and respect the reasoning for the Rooney Rule’ said Hughton. ‘They saw, similar to here, an under-representation of black coaches at the higher level. I've spoken about a, I think, real enthusiasm to change that. And if we can change that without legislation that's the best way.

‘I'm always conscious of my role and it's something that I'm very proud to do. When you speak to potential black and ethnic coaches that want to go into the game, one aspect that they always speak about are of course role models in the game. They would like to see representation, more at higher level. And any part I can play in that I am delighted to do.’
