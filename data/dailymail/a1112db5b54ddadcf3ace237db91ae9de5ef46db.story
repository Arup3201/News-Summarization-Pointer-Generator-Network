Business Secretary Vince Cable boasted on Twitter that he was voting to 'fix the Tories' unfair bedroom tax'

The Liberal Democrats were accused of ‘outrageous hypocrisy’ tonight after voting against one of the Government’s flagship welfare policies.

Lib Dem ministers and MPs voted in the House of Commons for drastic changes to the ‘spare room subsidy’ for council house tenants - a policy better known as the 'bedroom tax' which they voted for just two years ago.

Tory ministers said the reversal would cost £1billion in additional welfare spending.

Business Secretary Vince Cable even described the policy by the ‘bedroom tax’ name given to it by its most vociferous critics.

He wrote on Twitter: ‘I'm cancelling my meetings today to go to vote for the Lib Dem bill to fix the Tories' unfair bedroom tax.’

Tory sources described their coalition partners’ actions as a ‘cynical PR move’ designed to appeal to supporters ahead of Lib Dem party conference next month.

The move is also seen as a Lib Dem tactic to charm Ed Miliband in the run-up to the 2015 election.

Tory MP for Bury North David Nuttall said: ‘The Lib Dems are guilty of serial and outrageous hypocrisy.

‘This is not the first time they have changed their position on an issue to try and win back some of their former supporters.

‘They are clearly not a party who can be relied upon to stick to the same policy.’

Tory MP Philip Davies said the Lib Dems had shown they were ‘devious and untrustworthy’ and claimed the vote showed the coalition had officially come to an end.

Lib Dem ministers were allowed – in effect – to vote against the government after the normal rules on collective responsibility were suspended.

With Labour MPs backing the Affordable Homes Bill it passed by 306 votes to 231.

The Bill, which is proposed by backbench Lib Dem MP Andrew George, would create sweeping new exemptions for people whose housing benefit could be reduced.

The controversial reform, was first introduced in April 2013 – and backed by the Lib Dems – meant social housing tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced.

It would lead to no-one facing a benefit cut if there was no smaller property available for them to move to.

The Bill will in all likelihood be killed off by the Government at a later date. But its continued life in the House of Commons could delay Tory efforts to vote for a Tory measure to put in law the proposed 2017 EU referendum.

Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith claims he has simply removed a 'spare room subsidy' for people living in state-funded houses that were too big for them. But Labour say it is simply a 'bedroom tax'

Conservative Minister for Disabled People Mark Harper warned that the Bill would cost £1 billion if it was made law.

He demanded to know ‘what spending cuts or tax increases’ were proposed to pay for the change.

Supporters of the policy say it encourages people to move to appropriate sized properties, and housing associations to build suitably sized homes.

Labour has insisted it will scrap what it calls the ‘bedroom tax’.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: ‘The Government should scrap the hated bedroom tax following the overwhelming vote by MPs against the cruel tax on bedrooms today.

‘David Cameron and Nick Clegg's cruel and unfair bedroom tax has hit hundreds of thousands of people across the country causing misery, hardship and forcing families to rely on food banks. If the Government won't ditch the bedroom tax, then the next Labour government will.’

Ed Miliband described the vote as ‘incredible news’ and a ‘huge blow to David Cameron’.

The Lib Dems insisted their change of heart on the policy was a result of seeing it in action.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘This Bill is an excellent articulation of our policy which will help build a stronger economy in a fairer society.’

‘The Liberal Democrats believe that only those already in the social rented sector who turn down suitable smaller homes will see a reduction in their benefit.
