A second daughter of a 'fagin' mother who ran a lucrative family business selling goods online that the family stole from shops has been jailed.

Dawn Bainbridge led a 'family business' which involved her and her daughters stealing thousands and thousands of pounds-worth of clothes from high street stores across the North which they then sold on Facebook.

Their company, 'Designer Goods North East', took more than £7,000 in online payments in just four months, had detailed sales records and a debtors' book.

In a note seized by police, Bainbridge's daughter Caitlyn Bainbridge, 19, boasted of making £100 a week and dreamed of going it alone.

At Newcastle Crown Court last month Judge Sean Morris jailed Bainbridge, 47, for 30 months and her 21-year old daughter Claire for 20 months. 

Then yesterday Caitlyn, 19, was sentenced to 16 months jail.

Judge Morris told her: 'This was a professional, criminal family firm. 

'You played your part, you were the banker, you were the marketer, you went out on some trips as well.

'Thousands and thousads of pounds worth of goods were taken in professional, planned shoplifting expeditions and professionally marketed by you on your own Paypal account and with money being withdrawn to distribute amongst the directors of the firm, your mother and your older sister.'

When police raided the family home in West Rainton, County Durham, in March, they recovered goods stolen from Next, House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and elsewhere worth nearly £7,000

At Bainbridge's sentencing the court was told she was the 'mother and leader of the criminal firm'.

The judge said: 'You are the villain of the piece. It's your fault your daughters are in court. Some mother.'

Jamie Adams, defending Caitlyn, said: 'The whole scenario is reminiscent of something Dickens would write about.

'Fagin comes to mind in the form of her mother.'

The family stole from stores in Leeds, Bradford, Guiseley, York, Knaresborough, Harrogate, Stockton, Bishop Auckland, Durham, Gateshead and Edinburgh.

Their operation was uncovered by an investigator for high street chain Next, who bought clothes and proved them to have been stolen.

When police raided the family home in West Rainton, County Durham, in March, they recovered goods stolen from Next, House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and elsewhere worth nearly £7,000.

But still the thieving continued. Police seized a further £900-worth of stolen goods in June.

All three Bainbridges admitted conspiracy to steal.
