A couple returned from holiday to receive the horrifying news that their dog had been found strangled in kennels where he was staying.

Wendy and Kenny Ramsey were preparing to pick up Milo, their beloved seven-year-old Bichon Frisé, when they were told he had died in a tragic accident just a few hours earlier.

His collar had a tag marked ‘Top Dog’ and it is believed this became trapped between the partition wall surrounding the exercise area of his enclosure and the wire mesh over it.

By the time kennel staff found Milo he had been strangled.

Yesterday
 Mrs Ramsey, 51, said she did not understand how workers failed to spot 
Milo’s distress in time. ‘He was my baby and now he is gone and in my 
eyes he wasn’t looked after,’ said the mother of four.

‘We’ve
 taken him to these kennels before so we thought he would be safe there,
 so to be told he had been found dead was just unbelievable.

'Nothing 
will bring Milo back, but we just want to know why no one found him 
before it was too late.

'The thought of him hanging there, struggling to 
free himself, is unbearable – I feel really guilty for putting him in 
kennels now.’

Milo was staying at Hest Bank Kennels in Lancaster while his owners were on holiday in Turkey 

The animal's owners, Kenny and Wendy Ramsey, said they were devastated by the loss of the family pet 

The Ramseys are gutted about the loss of their family pet and say 'nothing is ever going to bring him back'

Mrs
 Ramsey and her 56-year-old husband – who are both care workers – had 
booked Milo into the established family-run Hest Bank Kennels near 
Lancaster for £120 while they spent ten days in Turkey.

A council investigation found the kennel owners were not to blame for the accident 

They
 arrived home to Morecambe, Lancashire, in the early hours of Friday but
 before they had chance to pick Milo up, Mrs Ramsey’s sister was called 
by the kennels to say he had died that morning.

‘My husband just keeps saying he wishes he hadn’t gone to sleep and just picked him up,’ said Mrs Ramsey.

Immediately after the accident, staff contacted the local environmental health unit, which regulates boarding kennels.

An
 inspector came out that day to examine the enclosure and gave it a 
clean bill of health.

The kennels sent the family a log of what 
happened, including efforts to revive Milo at 10.30am.

They are now in contact with insurers regarding compensation for the Ramseys.

However,
 Mrs Ramsey said: ‘I’m not happy with the explanation we’ve been given 
and I’m taking legal advice about what we can do next.’

She has written 
to the local council, but it had already cleared the kennels of 
wrongdoing.

Karen Leytham, of Lancaster city council, said: ‘We are satisfied this unfortunate incident was a tragic freak accident.’

Kennels
 owner Margaret Pennington said on the morning Milo died staff had been 
checking the dogs consistently and were ‘absolutely distraught’ about 
the death.

She
 said the kennels had been in business for 30 years and had never lost a
 dog in an accident such as Milo’s, with staff checking dogs for 
potentially unsafe collars when they arrive.

'He was my baby to me and now he is gone and in my eyes he wasn’t looked after,' said Mrs Ramsey. 

But Margaret Pennington, the owner of the kennels, said all dogs' collars are checked when they arrive.
