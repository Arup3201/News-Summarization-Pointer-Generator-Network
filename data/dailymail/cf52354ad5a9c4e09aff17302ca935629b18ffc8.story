A man has been arrested after more than 50 cars were found damaged with their tyres slashed this morning.

The 31-year-old was taken into custody after police spent around 12 hours tracing the damage.

The overnight attack on three connecting residential roads in Portsmouth is believed to have taken place between midnight and 7am.

Hampshire Police have launched an urgent appeal for information on suspicious activity in the area during those hours.

Aside from vandalism to the bodies of the cars, many tyres were slashed.

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said:
 'Officers have been working hard all day on this investigation and a 
31-year-old man from Portsmouth has been arrested.

'He is in custody at this time. We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious.'

Anyone with information or who wishes to report damage is asked to call Hampshire Constabulary on 101.
