Peter Mandelson warns cutting tuition fees could lead to universities shunning British students in favour of those from abroad 

Labour’s plan to reduce tuition fees could cause universities to shun home students in favour of those from abroad, Peter Mandelson has warned.

The former cabinet minister said reducing the £9,000 fee cap for those who live in Britain may mean universities recruit more international students to plug the funding gap.

He said such a move would ‘not be desirable’ if it came ‘at the expense’ of British students.

He added: ‘While I strongly welcome foreign students to Britain, I would not want to see them receiving preference over British students because of the greater income they bring to universities.’

It comes after figures revealed British universities are already spending millions on agencies to recruit wealthy students from outside the EU.

There is no limit to how much an institution can charge non-EU students, although there are limits in some courses.

The average annual fee for an international student last year was £11,289 for classroom subjects and £13,425 for laboratory-based courses, but some institutions charge considerably more.

Last year, Edinburgh University announced it planned to increase its international population to 50 per cent, although it denied this would put limits on home student numbers.

In a survey released this month by Times Higher Education, academics complained they were having to lower the level of classes for people with poor English – ‘to the disadvantage of native speakers’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband recently indicated he would pledge to cut fees for home students from their current level of £9,000 to £6,000, although a formal announcement is not due until next week.

Lord Mandelson spoke about the issue as part of a wide-ranging speech to Vice Chancellors at Universities UK, which represents the sector.

Speaking before the event, he said: ‘Anything that would boost the number of foreign students at the expense of British students would not be desirable and if you reduce fees for British students, you could not be surprised if universities turned to foreign students to make up the gap in funding.’

While he made it clear he did not want to go ‘head-to-head’ with his party, he said any reduction of the fee cap needed to be replaced by alternative funding sources.

He also warned of the need to protect research-intensive universities, quality of education and widening participation of young people.

In the year 2013-14, 13 per cent of the 2,299,355 total enrolments at British higher education institutions were by students from outside the EU.
