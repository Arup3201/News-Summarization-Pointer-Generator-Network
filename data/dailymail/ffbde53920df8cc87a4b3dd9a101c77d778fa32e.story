The Liverpool squad were all smiles as they hosted an opening training session at Princeton University on Tuesday.

The Reds have already visited Harvard University during their pre-season tour of America and were at Princeton this time out as they prepare to for their clash with Manchester City - the team that narrowly pipped them to the title last season -  tomorrow in New York.

Despite Luis Suarez departing for Barcelona this summer and a move for Loic Remy collapsing, the Reds have done some decent business in the window, with the confirmation of highly-rated Lille forward Divock Origi announced on Tuesday afternoon.

Origi joins for £10million and despite being immediately loaned back out to the French club, the club's supporters will be encouraged that manager Brendan Rodgers is continuing to give youth a chance at the club.

Rodgers has most certainly got the best out of the younger players at his disposal, most notably Raheem Sterling and Jon Flanagan, with things starting to take shape now as they look to go one step better in this year's Premier League.

One concern for Rodgers would have been the sight of new £25million signing Adam Lallana in a knee brace.

The 26-year-old will miss the start of the season and a reunion with his former club Southampton after being ruled out for a minimum of six weeks.

The Reds face further friendlies with AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund after the game tomorrow, before the season opener at Anfield against Southampton on August 17.
