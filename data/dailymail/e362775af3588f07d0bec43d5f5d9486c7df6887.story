David Cameron’s key Muslim adviser is being investigated by police after an alleged House of Lords bust-up with a fellow Muslim whom he called a ‘f****** dog’ and threatened to beat up.

Lord Sheikh is said to have launched the extraordinary tirade against imam Omar Faruk, whom he suspects may have been behind revelations in The Mail on Sunday that the Tory peer was besotted with a pretty waitress 45 years his junior.

The peer vigorously denies threatening or swearing at Mr Faruk.

Claim: Lord Sheikh, left, and Mr Faruk. The two have been reportedly had a bust-up in the House of Lords

In July, we revealed the 72-year-old married peer, who has advised Mr Cameron on Islamic issues at several private meetings, proposed to the waitress, 27, after offering a kilogram of gold in dowry.

Lord Sheikh allegedly confronted Mr Faruk as the imam went into the Lords to lead the Friday prayer known as jummah in the multi-faith prayer room. The Tory peer – who is chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum – then allegedly abused Mr Faruk, calling him a ‘f****** s***’, and waved his arms at him.

Mr Faruk, 44, who is also a barrister and was formerly Lord Sheikh’s chief-of-staff, was left tearful by the incident, and reported it to police. Scotland Yard confirmed it is investigating an allegation of ‘threatening behaviour’ against Lord Sheikh.

Mr Faruk told this newspaper he entered One Millbank, which is part of the House of Lords, just after 1pm on Friday and was confronted by Lord Sheikh in the reception area.

In Mr Faruk’s police statement, which has been seen by The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘He came towards me full of anger, his eyes were red and bloodshot. He said, “F*** off, you f****** shaitan [satan], you f****** s***, f*** off.” ’

He added: ‘He [Lord Sheikh] was waving his arms wildly about to hit me. I was shocked and afraid as he kept shouting and screaming, “F****** shaitan”. He then said, “You s***, you f****** s***, I am going to kick the s*** out of you.” ’

The alleged incident took place in the House of Lords

Mr Faruk, from East Dulwich, South London, said Lord Sheikh also called him a ‘f****** dog’. He said the alleged spat happened in front of a police officer, who did not intervene. Mr Faruk said he left One Millbank after the incident and was initially pursued by Lord Sheikh.

Lord Sheikh’s wife, Shaida – who is believed to be separated from her husband but still does his parliamentary work – is also said to have witnessed the incident. Tory MEP Syed Kamall is said to have seen  Mr Faruk being pursued by Lord Sheikh. Last night, Mr Kamall said: ‘I don’t want to get involved.’

Mr Faruk said he planned to carry on leading the Friday prayers, but added: ‘I was left tearful. He nearly assaulted me. It was humiliating.’

Lord Sheikh denied threatening or having a ‘verbal spat’ with Mr Faruk. The peer said Mr Faruk had attended Friday prayers uninvited, and was asked to leave by security. Lord Sheikh said that when Mr Faruk refused, he also asked him to leave.

The peer said he never threatened violence against Mr Faruk and never swore at him. He also said police officers have not contacted him yet in relation to the incident.
