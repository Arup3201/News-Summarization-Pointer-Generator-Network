CIA researchers have been involved in a 'sustained effort' for nearly a decade to crack the security protecting Apple iPhones and iPads.

This is according to investigative news site, The
Intercept, who today cited documents obtained from
NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The report says top-secret documents reveal U.S.
government researchers had created a version of XCode, Apple's 
software application development tool, to create surveillance
backdoors.

CIA researchers have been involved in a 'sustained effort' for nearly a decade to crack the security protecting Apple iPhones and tablets. This is according to, investigative news site, The Intercept, who claims to have access to top secret files detailing the spying activity

These backdoors would have allowed them access into programs distributed on Apple's App Store.

The Intercept has in the past published a number of reports
from documents released by whistleblower Snowden.

The site's
editors include Glenn Greenwald, who won a Pulitzer Prize for
his work in reporting on Snowden's revelations, and by
Oscar-winning documentary maker Laura Poitras.

It said the latest documents, which covered a period from
2006 to 2013, stop short of proving whether U.S. intelligence
researchers had succeeded in breaking Apple's encryption coding,
which secures user data and communications.

Efforts to break into Apple products by government security
researchers started as early as 2006, a year before Apple
introduced its first iPhone and continued through the launch of
the iPad in 2010 and beyond, The Intercept said.

Breaching Apple security was part of a top-secret programme
by the U.S. government, aided by British intelligence
researchers, to hack 'secure communications products, both
foreign and domestic' including Google Android phones, it added.

Silicon Valley technology companies have in recent months
sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that
their products have not become tools for widespread government
surveillance of citizens.

Last September, Apple strengthened encryption methods for
data stored on iPhones.

It claimed the changes meant the company no
longer had any way to extract customer data on the devices, even
if a government ordered it to with a search warrant. 

Silicon
Valley rival Google said shortly afterward that it
also planned to increase the use of stronger encryption tools.

What is a 'backdoor'?

A backdoor is a hidden remote access from an outside source to the device that enables the hacker to have almost full access with little detection.

Should you be worried if you use an Apple device?

Backdoors are not the type of thing an average hacker can easily exploit. So far there has been no evidence that they've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack

How would could the government potentially make use of these backdoors?

Backdoors can provide access to unencrypted information even if users have chosen to encrypt the data they back up.

Data can include the user's address book, stored photos, the voicemail database and any accounts configured on the device.

What are the main concerns?

Earlier this year, security expert Jonathan Zdziarski focused on three particular services known by the technical names com.apple.pcapd, com.apple.mobile.file_relay and com.apple.mobile.house_arrest that are a cause for concern.

How do these hidden files work?

The pcapd service starts a 'packet sniffer' on an iOS device which records all data traffic to and from your iPhone.

It's installed by default on all iOS devices and gives the user no warning when it's activated.

The file_relay service exists to sweep up large volumes of raw data from particular sources on an iPhone, and then release it in unencrypted form.

These include the address book, accounts, GPS logs, photos, notes, calendar files, call history, voicemail and other records.

The third service, house_arrest, originally allowed iTunes to copy documents to third-party apps.

Now, as reported in ReadWrite, house_arrest has access to wider app-related data, including photos, databases, screenshots and temporary 'cached' information.

More information about Apple's diagnostic capabilities is available from the firm's support pages.

Both companies said the moves were aimed at protecting the
privacy of users of their products and that this was partly a
response to wide-scale U.S. government spying on internet users
revealed by Snowden in 2013.

An Apple spokesman pointed to public statements by chief executive Tim Cook on privacy, but declined to comment further.

'I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked
with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor
in any of our products or services,' Cook wrote in a statement
on privacy and security published last year.

'We have also never
allowed access to our servers. And we never will.'

Leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and British
Prime Minister David Cameron have expressed concern that turning
such privacy-enhancing tools into mass market features could
prevent governments from tracking militants planning attacks.

The CIA did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Last year, a security expert warned Apple’s iOS software contains potentially sinister tools that could be used by governments to spy on iPhone and iPad users.

Speaking at the 'Hackers on planet Earth' conference in New York, Jonathan Zdziarski said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iPhone data.

He added files found hidden within the firm's software contain a file-relay service that can be used to access the user's address book, photos, voicemail and any accounts configured on the device. 

The conclusion was based on an analysis of 600 million iOS devices, with handsets running the most recent versions of the software at particular risk.

Mr Zdziarski said there is a file dubbed ‘com.apple.pcapd’ on the device that fires up without notifying the iOS device's owner.

He explained this can record network traffic and HTTP request/response data from the device and could be targeted via Wi-Fi.

‘This software isn't some legacy code left on the device by Apple engineers for testing - it has been actively updated and expanded in various iOS revisions,’ The Register claimed.

Backdoors are not the type of thing an average hacker can easily exploit, and so far there has been no evidence they've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack

Apple responded by saying the services identified by Mr Zdziarski are not deliberately provided for government agencies to exploit.

The company added they are for 'diagnostic' purposes, and to allow IT workers to manage their company’s devices.

It is unknown whether this is ongoing and CIA has not provided comment
