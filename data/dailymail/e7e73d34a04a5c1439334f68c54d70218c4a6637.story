A US Army veteran, who was disabled by two explosions while serving in Afghanistan, claims to have been ordered off the boardwalk by a police officer simply for having his service dog with him.

Jared Goering was on 26th Street North Wildwood broadwalk in New Jersey with his dog when he was approached by a police officer and ordered to leave the area.

Both he and his wife Sally claim they were 'harassed' and 'mocked' by the officer involved, before being issued with a summons.

Distressed: Disabled veteran Jared Goering was ordered away for having his service dog Gator with him

Disrespected: Jared Goering claims a police officer harassed him and his wife Sally

Mr Jared, who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan and one in Iraq during his 19 years service between 1993 and 2012, needs his three-year-old service dog Gator - short for Navigator - to get about and up and down stairs.

He said: 'Just like any veteran with disabilities
with a service dog, to come back and be harassed and shown no respect, 
it upset me - it really bothered me. I was up most of the night thinking
about it.

'I expected to get more respect from him because of the jobs that we both have to do.'

Mr Goering added: 'I also suffer from PTSD, severe anxiety, depression - and my dog plays a big part in my life.

'His main purpose is mobility but he also helps me with all my emotional problems from combat.'

Service dog: Mr Goering needs his three-year-old dog called Gator to help him get about

Gator: The service dog was issued to Mr Goering after he was blown up twice in the space of 36 hours

The couple even showed the officer the dog's service identification card, he still 
issued them a summons and ordered them off the boardwalk.

The incident left the veteran so upset he told news channel NBC40 he could not get to sleep that night as a result.

In 2009 Mr Goering suffered a double horror in the space of 36 hours when the vehicles he was travelling in were blown up twice by IEDs - roadside bombs.

After the incidents he was assigned Gator to help him in his day-to-day life.

On Thursday night, Mr Goering went for a walk with Gator and his wife, they were approached by the officer.

Angry: Mrs Goering believes the police service needs to be educated on the role service dogs have to play

Disrespected: The couple claim the police officer involved 'harassed' and 'mocked' them

Mrs Goering said: 'He mockingly asked if all veterans get 
service dogs. His dog is medically 
necessary and he is a service dog.'

She added: 'We want the public to be aware that 
there are different types of disabilities and different types of service
dogs - and police officers need to be educated about this.'

North Wildwood police officials said there were no pending charges, but that there are other circumstances surrounding the case.

The mayor of North Wildwood said they will issue a formal apology, if appropriate, pending the outcome of the investigation.

Banned: Dogs are not allowed on the boardwalk, although the couple believe Gator should be exempt

Unpleasant: The incident happened at 26th Avenue, North Wildwood on Thursday night
