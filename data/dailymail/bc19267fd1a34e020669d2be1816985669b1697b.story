For decades Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles has been home to the largest display of human misery in the United States - but now the area is facing its greatest challenge - gentrification.

Since the Fall of 2006, the Los Angeles Police Department has been steadily clearing Skid Row of vagrants and homeless by stepping up the search and arrest of the down-and-outs who line its street corners.

And for the past 20-years, photographer Camilo José Vergara has been documenting the slow metamorphosis of the iconic neighborhood of LA as it evolves from hosting the lowest dregs to even welcoming a brand new Whole Foods store.

Cleaning the streets: An officer with the LAPD arrests a man who has been found on the corner of a Skid Row avenue - as they begin a process which started in 2006

'I started documenting the area in 1995. Derelict people-- mostly African Americans and Latinos--numbering in the thousands, —are concentrated in Skid Row,' said Vergara to MailOnline.

'The missions came to the area first. The Fred Jordan Mission is over forty years old, and the Union Rescue Mission, now in a new building on San Julian Street, has been in the community for ninety years.

Cuffed: Another homeless individual who is living in a neat tent on a Skid Row sidewalk is arrested by police and presumably taken away from the gentrifying area

What's this? An officer with the LAPD searches a man who he has arrested on Skid Row and is questioning him about what he has found on him

'Many of the hotels built long ago to accommodate travelers arriving by train became single room occupancy hotels providing cheap places to live. After the missions came the soup kitchens, health facilities, and methadone clinics.'

From short-term workers and migrants feeling the hardships of the Great Depression, to servicemen shipping out during the Second World War and Vietnam, Skid Row has always had a transient nature.

Its most recent inhabitants have been those who find they have nowhere else to turn as drug addicts and alcoholics come to its streets to try to fight their demons.

'However, in recent years Skid Row has been transformed,' said Vergara.

'In addition to the museums, corporate offices and government buildings, many old industrial and commercial buildings in the area are being transformed into lofts, galleries, restaurants and luxury hotels. As Los Angeles’ old downtown is transformed into a new city center, officials have necessarily declared that the old Skid Row and the new downtown cannot coexist.'

Work to be done: City sanitation workers move in to clear up Skid Row after decades of neglect during which the area became a mecca for vagrants and homeless people who needed somewhere to stay

Passed out: This man seems to have laid himself out on the sidewalk of Skid Row in a rather slap-hazard fashion - which is presumably one of the reasons why the LAPD are trying to clean up the streets of the notorious area

Witness to what amounts to a virtual clearing of the streets by the LAPD, Vergara recounts how he was watched the tactics of police first hand.

'Over the years, I have witnessed many such incidents along Skid Row, but none impressed me more than the one I saw in May of 2007 when a police car arrived, siren blaring and its loudspeaker screaming 'Wake up!, Wake up!'

'Startled—and thinking a violent crime must have occurred—I saw a policeman standing over a sleeping figure on the sidewalk at South 4th Street. It was nine o’clock in the morning and apparently the destitute person under the blanket had overslept.'

Shoe and a home: This person has neatly laid out shoes to sell or that they own on the sidewalk of Skid Row - however, while this display is controlled - other's have not been so lucky and have been moved on by the LAPD

Community: Three men chat away the day in the afternoon Los Angeles sun on Skid Row as one of them animatedly makes his point

Sad and lonely: For decades Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles has been home to the largest display of human misery in the United States - but now the area is facing its greatest challenge - gentrification

Life goes on: Since the Fall of 2006, the Los Angeles Police Department has been steadily clearing Skid Row or vagrants and homeless by stepping up the search and arrest of the down-and-outs who line its street corners

'Many of the hotels built long ago to accommodate travelers arriving by train became single room occupancy hotels providing cheap places to live. After the missions came the soup kitchens, health facilities, and methadone clinics.'

Wit and art: From short-term workers and migrants feeling the hardships of the Great Depression, to servicemen shipping out during the Second World War and Vietnam, Skid Row has always had a transient nature

No hope: Its most recent inhabitants have been those who find they have nowhere else to turn as drug addicts and alcoholics come to its streets to try to fight their demons

Indeed, these people are homeless, and while a Whole Foods may be a symbol of downtown LA's gentrification, the former residents need somewhere to go.

'When I asked who was pushing the homeless out of Skid Row a woman explained 'the city, the police, the maintenance people,' said Vergara.

'I asked: Where are they going? She replied: 'They are going to jail. They are going under the bridges, by the LA River. They are going to the missions, but some don’t want to go there.'

Feeling as if he is watching the end of Skid Row as we have known it, Vergara, who has published a new book entitled, Harlem, The Unmaking of a Ghetto, knows how impoverished neighborhoods can change.

'As the police gradually gain control over Skid Row, I feel I am witnessing its last days. In a decade or so Skid Row will perhaps become LA’s equivalent of New York’s Greenwich Village.'
