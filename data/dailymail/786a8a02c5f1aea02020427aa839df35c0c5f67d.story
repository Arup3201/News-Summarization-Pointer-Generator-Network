Chelsea midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah is wanted by Watford, Reading and Ipswich.

The 20-year-old was blocked from making a loan move to Bordeaux due to the three club rule after playing for Chelsea's U21 side and Burnley but he can join a Championship side on an emergency loan.

Chalobah only made four appearances for Burnley while on loan and appeared for Chelsea's U21 side but they were deemed competitive games.

Watford had Chalobah on loan in 2012 and are keen to give him a run of games as they bid to go up to the Premier League. 

Ipswich are better placed as they lie second in the Championship while Reading have a lot more ground to make up as Steve Clarke looks to ensure they move clear of the relegation zone first.

The 20-year-old is highly rated at Chelsea and Jose Mourinho will be keen for Chalobah to sign for a club where he will play first-team football for the second half of the season. 

Chalobah has featured 21 times for the England Under-21s but is yet to make an appearance for Chelsea's first team.

Chalobah has 21 caps for the England Under 21 side, and has also played for the Under 16, 17 and 19 sides

Steve Clarke (centre) would be interested in bringing Chalobah to Reading if they can break out the drop zone
