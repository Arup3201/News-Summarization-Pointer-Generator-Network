A former soccer player at Clemson University has filed a lawsuit against her teammates and coaches alleging she suffered severe injuries during a 2011 hazing incident.

Haley Ellen Hunt filed the suit in Pickens County, South Carolina on Aug. 15, claiming she was kidnapped, stuffed in the trunk of a car, forced to perform 'humiliating and demeaning acts,' and then sent sprinting into a brick wall while blindfolded.

The injuries were so severe she says she was forced to stop playing soccer.

Hunt says in her suit that the hazing process was 'a mandatory team activity.'

The lawsuit names as defendants Eddie Radwanski, coach of the women's soccer team; assistant coaches Siri Mullinix and Jeff Robbins; former Athletic Director Terry Don Phillips; Associate Athletic Director Kyle Young; Marvin Carmichael, an assistant to the president of the university; 10 unnamed Clemson officials who the lawsuit alleges were aware of the team's hazing ritual; and 14 members of the team, according to The Greenville Times.

According to Hunt, on Aug. 18, 2011, she and other freshman players were woken up during the night, blindfolded, and put in the trunks of cars by older players on the team.

After being driven around for 30 minutes, and being asked to performed unnamed 'humiliating and demeaning acts,' Hunt was taken into a dark room adjacent to the Riggs Field, where the team played home games, and spun around in circles 'to disorient her and impair her balance.'

She was then told to start sprinting, still blindfolded, at which point she ran straight into a brick wall.

As a result, she claims to have suffered a 'traumatic brain injury.'

The university said in a statement, 'Clemson University strongly disagrees with the characterization of events in this lawsuit, and looks forward to vigorously defending this case on its facts, rather than these allegations. The university will not comment further on this pending litigation.'

The lawsuit seeks punitive damages, attorney's fees and court costs.
