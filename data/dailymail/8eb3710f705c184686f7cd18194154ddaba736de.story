When  this brazen fox snuck into Fred Rossington’s home, his first thought was to ensure his grandchildren and wife were safe and out of its way. 

His second thought was to grab the camera.

Mr Rossington who lives with his wife, Karen, in Horsham, West Sussex, spotted this pesky fox race across his living room after it crept in through the back door - left open for just a few minutes.

The fox entered Fred Rossington's house looking for a tasty snack

The bold animal had run past the Rossington’s pet dog in the garden and even his pen of chickens – a more traditional snack for foxes - in pursuit of a more human treat.

And it seems the fox would go to great lengths to find it.

After coming to face-to-face with Mr Rossington in the lounge, undeterred, he ran over the top of the couch and headed for the kitchen.

He then leaped on to the work tops, scattering sharp cooking knives all over the floor, clambering over their Aga cooker in a desperate hunt for food.

It was only upon being shooed and kicked away that the fully-grown mammal gave up and left the house. 

Mr Rossington said: ‘Amazingly, it then ran ten metres, stopped and looked back at me, before wandering off to the fields.

‘After telling my wife to close the door and stay in the living room, I was just thankful none of my grandchildren were at the house, as they often are.

The grandfather of five said that both his lounge and kitchen are decorated in cream so his main concern became that ‘it would defecate everywhere, ruining the furniture. My wife wouldn’t have been happy about that.'

Mr Rossington, who runs a data installation company with his wife, added: The fox was not frightened of me at all, it must have been used to human contact. The smell of my dog must have been everywhere to.’
