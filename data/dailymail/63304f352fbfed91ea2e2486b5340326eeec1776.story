It was another entertaining weekend in the Barclays Premier League with 36 goals scored across the nine games. Eight of those goals came at St Mary’s as Southampton thrashed Sunderland, while Sergio Aguero scored all four for Manchester City as they beat Spurs 4-1.

There was plenty of late drama as well as Danny Welbeck rescued a point for Arsenal against Hull in stoppage time. While across London at Loftus Road there were four goals between the 87th minute and 95th minute as Liverpool edged out QPR 3-2.

Sportsmail’s reporters look back on the weekend and give their favourite moment from a memorable round of games.

Everything Enner Valencia does seems to go 'boom'. Until Saturday, he was restricting his goals this season to screaming shots for club and country, but that header at Burnley; twisting, moving away from goal and then thudding it from the centre of his head was terrific. There were many crazy moments from this weekend, but allow me to enjoy fourth place and a West Ham forward who looks a real menace. And that's before we mention his free-scoring mate, Diafra Sakho. Bring on Manchester City next week, Vincent Kompany… you have been warned.

After all the melodrama of 'Tiredgate' it did make me chuckle to see Raheem Sterling skipping free like a teenager in the 95th minute of Liverpool's game against QPR to set up the winning goal. Making no judgements on Brendan vs Roy but most of us would love to be as 'burnt out' as English football's quickest 19-year-old.

Over the past month or so Garry Monk has increasingly muttered about referees. The frustration has been rising, with his perception that Swansea don't get a fair shake from officials has intensified. On Sunday, he blew his top. He will likely be charged by the FA for his outburst against Michael Oliver, having already been patronised by Mark Hughes. But his rawness is what appeals. He says what he thinks. At some point, with fines and such like, that will be chiselled out of him. But for now it is nice to hear honest thoughts from a manager.

Seeing Newcastle United come up with new and imaginative ways to keep themselves in the news. Last week, having proudly installed a giant LED screen inside the stadium, the club declared that its arrival would enhance the match day experience for all fans. Well, if they meant it would afford them an extra hour in the pub then they were right. The canvas around their jazzy new screen became dislodged in the wind before the game, delaying kick-off to 4pm amid safety concerns. But owner Mike Ashley – for once – missed a trick. For while the eyes of the world were on the canvas as it flapped in the breeze, not a single Sports Direct ad appeared on the screen next to it!

An early flight to Russia on Sunday means I missed the drama at Loftus Road but watching Harry Redknapp's press conference on MailOnline on Sunday night was priceless. You can see clearly see the workings of Redknapp's mind as he is telling himself: 'Don't slag off Taarabt… don't say it…whatever you do, DO NOT say that thing about him being a fat waste of space…'. Oops… too late… he said it…

Switching on the TV at 4.45pm and seeing Jeff Stelling saying 'Yes! That is eight!' as he tried to explain Sunderland's capitulation at Southampton. Such one-sided scorelines are associated with different eras, so when one comes along as it did at the weekend, it genuinely makes you do a double take if you have been oblivious to what has been happening minute-by-minute. The result was capped by that magnificent own goal from Santiago Vergini. Chaotic football at its best.

A moment of pathos rather than joy: the look on Harry Redknapp's face after *that* Steven Caulker own goal. After 56 years in the game, it still hurts just as much and it still matters. On one hand that gives me hope that your passion for the game can still be alive after so long. Alternatively, I despair - it never gets any better, no matter how long you watch the game.

Loads of Arsenal 'fans' were left gagging on their half-time prawn sandwiches when Abel Hernandez scored a marvellous team goal within a minute of the restart. Hull's team of giants had beat the Gunners at their own game: intricate passing, a sublime ball for Tom Huddlestone and Hernandez beating Arsenal's only 'big lad' (Mertesacker) in the air to score. I'd mis-timed my visit to spend a penny but I did catch a brilliant exchange between two Gooners still stood beneath a TV screen… 'Is that live, John?'

'Nah, we got this one in the bag, Phil.'

My team Tottenham lost on Saturday but I was pleased to see Roberto Soldado finally get a chance to start in the Premier League. Yes, he missed a penalty but he set up the goal, won the penalty and brought more to the team than Emmanuel Adebayor has all season. Some players need love and patience. Soldado links up well with Christian Eriksen, has a good footballing brain and suits the team's style. Now if they can just sort out that defence…

Oscar's free-kick was sublime but it was eclipsed by Chelsea's second at Selhurst Park: a slick and intricate passing sequence with Cesc Fabregas, bouncing passes off team-mates before applying a clinical finish. It was a sparkling gem amid a ruthless performance which left you wondering if this was the champions in action. And if this is another exceptional team being assembled by Jose Mourinho.

The handshake between Brendan Rodgers and Harry Redknapp at the final whistle at Loftus Road said it all. Rodgers puffing his cheeks out and almost apologising. Redknapp shaking his head and muttering expletives in disbelief. The last eight minutes of QPR vs Liverpool summed up the chaotic brilliance of the Premier League.

It's probably cruel to highlight an own goal but Santiago Vergini's spectacular effort was too funny. Jamie Pollock scoring through his own net with all the skill of Gazza while playing for Manchester City had for years been my favourite, but the way Vergini struck the ball with such sweetness, and in no danger, nudges it top. Honourable mention to Lukasz Fabianski for his comically late dive to try to keep out Jon Walters' header. One for the cameras, perhaps.

I was fortunate enough to be at St Mary's at the weekend where Santiago Vergini scored what will surely go down as the own goal of the season. Southampton and Sunderland fans were momentarily stunned into silence when the defender struck a peach of a first-time volley from the edge of the box – unfortunately for Vergini it was past his own goalkeeper Vito Mannone. It's unlikely he has ever made a sweeter connection with a ball dropping from the sky. The fact I am picking that ahead of the eight goal annihilation of Sunderland, is testament to how good (or bad) Vergini's volley was.

Jose Mourinho labelled Chelsea's second goal at Palace as 'scandalous' – it really was a thing of pure beauty. Seventeen passes from one end of Selhurst Park to the other, with eight different players involved and nine touches by the eventual goalscorer Cesc Fabregas. During a game that had almost descended into a training match, the change of pace and urgency of the Blues was frightening. Fabregas gave Julian Speroni the eyes to finish, too.

The fact that Michael Oliver gave a penalty against Ryan Shawcross for wrestling down Wilfried Bony in the area. 'But if you give that, you'll have six penalties a match,' the apologists bleat. So be it, if there are six penalties a game those grappling matches at corners will soon stop.

And maybe instead of grabbing opponents, defenders will actually, you know, defend corners.
