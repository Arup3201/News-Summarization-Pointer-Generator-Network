A carer was caught red-handed stealing cash from a dementia-suffering grandmother after her suspicious family installed a spy camera.

Edward Helps, 61, and his wife Susan, 60, rigged up the hidden device and concealed it inside a DVD player to catch Leeanne Edwards, 38, in the act.

They became suspicious after Susan's frail mother Irene Goody, 85, repeatedly asked for more money and cash kept disappearing last March.

But after police reportedly told them they were 'too busy' to investigate, the family were forced to gather evidence themselves.

Leeanne Edwards was caught on camera stealing from dementia sufferer Irene Goody, 85, after Mrs Goody's family became concerned that money was going missing and set up a CCTV camera in her flat

Mr Helps bought a secret recording device from the internet and set it up at the sheltered flat in Droitwich, Worcestershire. The camera then captured Edwards brazenly rifling through drawers for cash.

Mr Helps handed the evidence over to police and Edwards was arrested in May last year and charged with theft.

She pleaded guilty to stealing £120 at Worcester Magistrates Court yesterday and was told she could face jail when she is sentenced next month.

After the case, Mr Helps told how the family were forced to investigate the matter and gather evidence themselves when West Mercia Police refused to help.

The company director said: 'We were sure something was up because my mother-in-law kept asking for more money and was confused as to what she had spent it on.

'This kept happening over a period of weeks and it was starting to really upset her. Hundreds of pounds was going missing.

'When I contacted the police with our concerns they said they couldn't help because they were too busy and did not have enough staff.

'They told me without evidence they couldn't do anything - but surely it's their jobs to at least look for evidence.'

The family said Mrs Goody trusted and liked Edwards and was shocked when she saw the footage

Mr Helps added: 'They [police] just said "we've got more serious crimes to worry about". I could not believe it.

'I decided we'd have to sort this out ourselves so I bought a hidden camera and set it up at the flat.

'After about a week of the camera being in there I was able to see Leeanne. If my mother-in-law wasn't in the room she went through the drawers.

'On one occasion she took my mother-in-law to the toilet and then went straight to her handbag, covering her hands so she didn't leave any fingerprints.

'But shockingly the police still didn't want to help. Eventually I said if you're not going to do anything then I'm going to go round and sort it out. Within an hour they had arrested her.

'My mother-in-law's trust in carers is totally shot now. She loved this girl. When she saw the footage she couldn't quite believe it.

'The amount of money is insignificant, it is the principal that counts and people need to know what she has done to our family.'

Edwards, pictured with her T-shirt stuck in a draw, admitted theft in court yesterday and could now be jailed

The court heard Edwards had been privately employed by the family of Mrs Goody - who is in the early stages of dementia - to visit her every evening.

She was entrusted with making sure the retired seamstress, who has eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, had taken her daily medication and had everything she needed before bed.

Prosecutor Claire Linehan said the family first noticed something was wrong when money started going missing last March.

She added: 'Going through the CCTV it was quite apparent she (Edwards) had entered the property and gone through a few items and looked through them.

'It was even seen she was wiping down the drawers to remove any fingerprints.'

Kate Oliver, defending, added: 'She knows you will not be impressed at all that his is a vulnerable victim'.

The thefts took place at The Heriotts sheltered housing in Worcestershire where Edwards had been privately employed by the family to come in and help Mrs Goody. The home's managers assisted the investigation

A West Mercia Police spokesman said Mr Helps could contact them if he wished to complain about the incident.

He added: 'West Mercia Police is committed to providing a professional service at all times and when a complaint is received it is always investigated thoroughly and robustly.

'If it is felt conduct fell below our usual high standards it will be dealt with appropriately.'

Clare Huyton, executive director for Fortis Living, who run the sheltered complex, said management had met with Mr Helps to discuss his concerns.

She added: 'Mr Helps asked it was kept a secret from staff and other residents as he didn't want the carer to know about the surveillance.'

Edwards, from Droitwich, will appear before the same court for sentencing on February 6.
