A 61-year-old man has been arrested and charged after allegedly groping a sleeping woman while touching himself on a Newark-bound flight on Sunday.

Indian national, Devender Singh, who lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has been charged with one count of abusive sexual contact and appeared in federal court in New Jersey on Monday.

The woman claims she had fallen asleep in a window seat when she awoke to find Singh kissing her and putting his hand down her shirt while he exposed himself to her.

The woman managed to push Mr. Singh off her before rushing to the back of the plane to alert the cabin crew.

She demanded that police meet the plane on arrival and Mr. Singh was taken into custody by the FBI when the United Airlines flight from Houston landed.

U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Paul J. Fishman said that the woman did not know Mr. Singh.

The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over all sexual abuse cases that occur on aircraft in flight in the United States.

Singh faces two years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted, authorities said.
