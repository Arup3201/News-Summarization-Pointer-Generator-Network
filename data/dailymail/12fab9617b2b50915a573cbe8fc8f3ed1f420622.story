A husband caught a thief who had been stealing his wife’s underwear for a year by staying up all night and hiding in his shed to catch him.

The husband, known as Dominique, became so annoyed that his wife had become too scared to even leave their home that he decided to set a trap in his garden in Naintré near Poitiers, south-west France.

He realised the thief struck on Wednesday and Sunday nights and set up CCTV in the back garden last month to do night watches until 3 or 4am.

Snared: A husband caught a thief who had been stealing his wife's underwear for a year by staying up all night and hiding in his shed to catch him. On CCTV he saw this man wearing a hat, scarf and gloves creeping around and stealing the underwear

His dedication to catching the thief paid off - and he saw a man wearing a hat, scarf and gloves creeping around and stealing the underwear.

Determined to catch the man and stop underwear being stolen when the washing was hung out to dry, Dominique extended his watch from 8pm to 6am, reported The Local.

And on Monday morning at around 5.30 am he caught a glimpse of the thief on the camera going under the clothing rack. 

The husband then sprang into action in a determined bid to catch the man.

'He got down on his knees and went over underneath the clothes rack,” Dominique told local newspaper La Nouvelle République.

'I was in a little shed with the door half open, and I jumped out on top of him, but I slipped because it had been raining,' he added.

'At that point my two sons intervened, and got him under control in the end. They tied his feet together and we waited for the police.'

When police found and searched the 35-year-old's car, they discovered over 30 pairs of knickers.

They were taken as evidence and the man also confessed to stealing underwear from women in the nearby towns of Châtellerault and Cenon in the Vienne department.

The man will now face community service, rather than a criminal trial and custodial sentence, according to the local paper.
