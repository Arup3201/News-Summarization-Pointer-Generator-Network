A standoff with an armed man who took multiple hostages inside a Trenton home has ended, and three children are safe, police said early Sunday.

Word of the confrontation's conclusion came a short while after the standoff, which had had prompted the evacuation of nearby homes, entered its third day.

'The Trenton hostage situation is resolved, the three children are safe, and the area is secure,' state police Sgt. Adam Grossman told The Associated Press, delivering a joint statement also from Trenton police and county prosecutors.

Pushed out: Residents from Grand Street in South Trenton were evacuated and waited in fear for the standoff's ultimate conclusion

Grossman said the standoff ended at 
3:45 a.m. Sunday but refused to reveal any more details, including how 
it ended, what became of the gunman, any information about the children,
and if there were any other hostages.

Grossman said more details will be released at a news conference later Sunday morning.

The
man had been holed-up in a 
two-story red brick house in South Trenton, authorities said. The 
standoff began Friday afternoon.

During
the standoff, police declined to give any details on the number of 
people being held, their ages or relationship to the armed man.

Armed: SWAT police personnel stand guard outside the South Trenton home where a man held several children hostage, having killed their mother and 13-year-old brother

Evacuated: Police evacuated the area and used flash bombs to secure the home, firing a single shot at the suspect before paramedics were called

Earlier, state police Lt. Stephen 
Jones had described the standoff as an 'ongoing, tense situation' and 
said police were working to 'bring this to a peaceful end.'

Philadelphia's NBC10 reports that the mother has been identified by family members as Carmelita Stevenson.

‘They had a little misunderstanding and the guy killed her and my nephew,’ said Stevenson’s sister Tonya Kelly, who drove in Maryland when she heard the news.

Kelly, who refers to the suspect as ‘Skip’ said three of her sister’s other children—aged 20, 18, and 4—were the other hostages, while another one of Stevenson’s sons, aged 19, was able to escape.

On
Saturday, family members of a woman they said was among the hostages 
grew angry, with some of them going under police tape and briefly 
confronting officers about the situation.

'Do something! Do something!' screamed a man who said he was the woman's nephew. 'Make something happen!'

Police presence: Police were first called Friday afternoon, when they entered the home and found the mother Carmelita Stevenson and her 13-year-old son dead

Watching & Waiting: New Jersey police officers stood guard on a street in Trenton, New Jersey. The gunman held two teen girls and a 4-year-old boy along with the dead mother and son

Drawn out: Police were called just before 3pm on Friday and were still in position early on Saturday morning until the ultimate conclusion early Sunday

Tense: Negotiations continued, but top no avail and police eventually chose to enter the home

Police were called to the home just before 3 p.m. Friday on reports that a man had barricaded himself inside.

Authorities
said police entered the home and found the man brandishing a gun. 
Police retreated safely, and a SWAT team was called.

Perimeter: Neighbours and local media were kept back as police conducted negotiations with the armed man

Police said an arson bomb unit also was on the scene. Police declined to say whether the man was making any demands.

Homes
on the surrounding block had been evacuated as a precaution, and police
tape cordoned off the street in front of the house and nearby. An 
ambulance was parked near the home but left the scene earlier Saturday.

Shock: Neighbours were stunned by the news that a woman and her child had been shot. The couple had moved to the neighbourhood just four months ago
