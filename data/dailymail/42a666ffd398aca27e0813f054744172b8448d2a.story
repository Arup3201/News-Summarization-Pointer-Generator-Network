A third person connected to a grisly murder involving a Chicago teen luring her ex-boyfriend's brother to her new lover who brutally murdered him and butchered his lifeless corpse has been arrested.

Milton Miranda, 22, killed Jose Reyes, 30,while Daisy Gutierrez watched before helping conceal evidence, police said. He was arrested Saturday in New Jersey and will join his 19-year-old girlfriend and her father behind bars while awaiting trial.

Salvadore Gutierrez, the girl's father, was also arrested for helping bury the viciously murdered man's remains in his back yard, police said.

Co-conspirators: Daisy Gutierrez, 19, left, is charged with first-degree murder for luring a man to his death. Her boyfriend Milton Miranda, 22, right, is also charged with first-degree for committing the brutal act

Also implicated: Father Salvadore Gutierrez, 56, has been charged with helping to try to conceal the body

Mr Miranda was arrested Saturday in New Jersey and extradited to Illinois, the Chicago Police Department announced Sunday.

The couple is alleged by police to have hatched a plan to lure her former flame's boyfriend into the girl's bedroom where she stripped off her clothes May 21 before Mr Miranda came bursting through the door, beat the unwitting man with a pipe and slit his throat, the Chicago Sun-Times.

Ms Gutierrez had previously been in a relationship with Mr Reyes' brother that produced more than one child, and he had expressed an interest in her, sources told the paper.

Not content to just beat and stab the innocent man to death, Mr Miranda then hacked off his head and butchered the rest of his body so it would fit into plastic bags, authorities said.

The deranged girl has been charged with concealing a homicide for watching as Mr Miranda brutally murdered and slaughtered the victim after police say she admitted to doing so.

An autopsy confirmed the official cause of death was ‘multiple sharp force injuries’ and ‘assault.’

Grisly: Police say Jose Reyes, 30, was brutally slain and dismembered by a vengeful new boyfriend of Daisy Gutierrez on May 21

Tricked: The 30-year-old Honduran had moved to the U.S. five years before his brutal murder. Police say he was lured to his death by Daisy Gutierrez

Once sure Mr Reyes was dead, the heartless girl called her father to tell him she 'fixed the problem,' a source told the Sun-Times.

She convinced to help conceal the body, he spent three hours digging a hole in his backyard and watched as Mr Miranda placed the body parts in plastic bags into the hole, cops said.

The perverse pair then fled to New Jersey but was quickly arrested.

Mr Reyes' body was found by police only days later after they searched the home. It is unknown what prompted detectives to look for Reyes at the Gutierrez residence.

It is also unclear what prompted the teen mother of three - who is also three months pregnant with her new boyfriend’s child - to admit to the crime along with her father.

House of horrors: Police say this house on the South Side of Chicago was the site of the unthinkable crime

Awful: Investigators found Reyes' dismembered remains in plastic bags in the backyard. Ms Gutierrez and her father admitted to helping bury the evidence, police said

Her bond was set at $2 million. His father’s was set at $500,000.

Police say they also found human body parts in jars in the house. They have not yet determined whether those remains belong to Reyes or to someone else.

Assistant state’s attorney Heather Kent said Gutierrez has a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old with Reyes’ brother.

The father of those two boys and the grieving brother of the victim spoke previously about the ordeal.

'My sons can't stay with people like that,' Jorge Moncada said in Spanish. 'I'm going to fight for them.'

Unwanted advances: Mr Reyes was the brother of Ms Gutierrez's ex-boyfriend and had apparently taken a liking to the teen before her jealous lover savagely killed him, cut him into pieces and buried his body

He also said these tragic events are entirely surprising.

'She threatened me and my brother several times, she planned this,' said Mr Moncada.

According to her public defender, Ms Gutierrez’s third child, a three-year-old, is with another man. She is pregnant with Mr Miranda’s child.

After she conspired with Mr Miranda to kill Mr Reyes, police say she asked her family to leave the house so that she could have him over.

Daisy and Salvador Gutierrez admitted to the crimes under questioning from investigators.

Neighbors of Mr Reyes' held a collection to help the family repatriate his body to Honduras.

'He was a wonderful person, a really hard worker, really nice. Like a neighbor he always helped,' a neighbor said.
