Wearing a picture of his twin brother pinned to a red rose and draped over his heart, Bradley Morcombe married his schoolgirl sweetheart Anna Martin in a church ceremony before family and friends.

Bradley's twin brother, Daniel Morcombe was abducted and murdered on Queensland's Sunshine Coast ten years ago in what became Australia's highest profile missing child case which was only resolved  earlier this year.

Bradley, 24, and his older brother, Dean, who took on the role of best man in place of the honour that would have gone to Daniel, both wore roses in their lapels and pictures of Daniel.

She's his misssus: A radiant bride Anna Martin and her new husband, Bradley Morcombe, walk back down the aisle after saying their wedding vows.  Prior to the wedding, the new Mrs Morcombe paid tribute on Facebook to Bradley - whose twin brother, Daniel was the victim of one of Australia's most high profile child abduction and murder cases. She wrote, 'Love isn't always rosy, but true love is never giving up on the tougher times. 6 years together and we have definitely had our fair share of biff ups, disagreements and tears. On the upper hand, we have given each other the best times, helped each other and grown together. He is a once in a life time kinda boy and I'm gonna be his Mrs in a week'

Cheeky boys: Bradley Morcombe (left) and twin brother Daniel as young boys. In 2003 at the age of 13, Daniel, was abducted and murdered although his family did not know what had happened to him until his remains were uncovered in 2011 after a long police investigation and the family was able to lay him to rest. Bradley said of his twin this year, there had not been a day since that he hadn't thought of him

The colour red - which came to symbolise Daniel, because of the last t-shirt he wore before he was abducted and in the long years while parents, Denise and Bruce, searched for their boy - was the theme of the wedding.

Bride Anna Martin carried a bouquet of red roses and her bridesmaids wore long red strapless dresses and also carried red flowers.

Ms Martin, 25, wore a slim-fitting white dress with a lace bodice and peplum, floor length train and veil.

Bradley Morcombe had paid tribute in the lead-up to his wedding to Ms Martin, saying Daniel would 'looking down from heaven' on the ceremony.

Bradley's father, Bruce Morcombe, said that in the years following the disappearance and abduction murder of Bradley's twin brother, Daniel, it had been of utmost importance both to find Daniel's remains and to keep his family together. He said he has watched on proudly as older son Dean and  Bradley have passed their life milestones. 'They both have good jobs, a steady girlfriend and they've purchased houses,' he said

Beautiful tribute: In a card to his new wife Anna Martin, Bradley Morcombe wrote a touching tribute.

Bradley, Daniel and Ms Martin all attended Siena Catholic College in south-east Queensland before Daniel disappeared while waiting for a bus at Woombye on the Sunshine Coast as he planned to go Christmas shopping,  on December 7, 2003.

His remains were only discovered in August 2011, after years of searching in which the Morcombes refused to give up searching for their son and 'bringing him home'.

Bruce Morcombe told Daily Mail Australia earlier this month that as important as it had been 'bringing Daniel home, he had been determined over the last decade not to let the tragedy tear his family apart, as well as helping his other two sons to live productive and happy lives.

A week before the wedding, Ms Martin posted a tribute to her husband-to-be Bradley, saying, 'Love isn't always rosy, but true love is never giving up on the tougher times. 6 years together and we have definitely had our fair share of biff ups, disagreements and tears. On the upper hand, we have given each other the best times, helped each other and grown together. He is a once in a life time kinda boy and I'm gonna be his Mrs in a week'.

Driving force: Denies and Bruce Morcombe (pictured with their book earlier this month) said as well as finding the remains of their lost son Daniel, it had been of paramount importance to keep their family together under the  strains and pressures , which he hoped to impart to other families suffering tragedy and loss. Their book 'Where is Daniel? The Family's Story' written with Lindsay Simpson and published by Pan MacMillan, is available from bookshops

The wedding was officiated by celebrant and the former policewoman Julie Elliott who acted as the special family liaison officer for the Morcombes in the years while Daniel was missing.

The ceremony has come after a tumultuous year for the family, with the trial and conviction of Brett Peter Cowan for Daniel's abduction and murder; Cowan was jailed for life in March this year.

On August 2, Denise and Bruce Morcombe launched their book,  'Where is Daniel? The Family's story', published by Pan MacMillan, which Mr Mrocombe said was part inside story and partly a guide for families who had experienced traumatic life events.

'If the Morcombes can stay together, well so can others,' he said. 'The book ... is very much a survival of the Morcombe family, so that out experience will benefit other families.'It was very much a concerted decision [for us] to be strong. You are very much aware through media reports how a significant life event almost always results in the family exploding.'The wedding we hope will be a very positive and happy family event.

'In the back of everyone's minds, there is where is Daniel, where is the twin? But it is Brad and Anna's day.'

On her wedding day, the bride posted the following message on her Facebook page, 'Bradley Morcombe you amaze me every single day. I love you, I can't wait much longer to see your cute little possum face xxx', followed after the ceremony by a photo of the groom with the words, 'Proud as punch to have me as his mrs'.

The couple has gone on honeymoon to French Polynesia, posting happy messages about their time away.

Earlier this year, Bradley Morcombe told Australian Women's Weekly there had not been a day since that he hadn't thought of his brother.

'He is with us all the time, every single day,' Bradley said. 'He's still part of the family. He'll always be my brother and I'll always miss him, no matter what happens in the future.'

In a card to his new wife, a photo of which is posted on Facebook, Brad Morcombe writes, 'I've always dreamt of having you as my wife. Today my dream comes true. You're the most beautiful girl.'
