At first glance, you may think you're in a Mattel museum.

But the 2,000 Barbies and 1,000 Kens lining the walls of this home show collector Stanley Colorite's 'Dream House'.

The 41-year-old, who calls himself the Barbie Man, started collecting nearly two decades ago and spends $30,000 a year adding to it.

His seven-bedroom home in Florida has become a tribute to the popular toy, taking up four rooms - including the bathroom.

Stanley Colorite's collection is so extensive it has already taken over four bedrooms and one bathroom in his seven-bedroom home. He keeps his most expensive Dream House, worth $1,000 in the bathroom alongside the likes of Mermaid Barbie

Mr Colorite stores parts and accessories for the dolls in his closet for the maintenance of the 3,000-strong collection

He has 2,000 Barbies and 1,000 Ken dolls, which are worth up to $1,000.

He has also bought 3,000 Barbie outfits, including one by fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, as well as an airplane, motorcycle, limousine and camper van for the dolls.

The extensive collection includes everything from Barbie mouthwash and plasters to a Dream House, with working shower and lift, thought to be worth $1,000.

Mr Colorite, who runs his own cleaning business, said: 'I started with just one doll and my collection has grown and grown.

'Barbie isn't just a toy for children, she's for adult collectors too.

'I can't stop collecting - it's like a drug habit, I just can't quit.'

It's taken 16 years for Mr Colorite to amass his collection so far, spending up to $30,000 a year on new finds

There's plenty of room for Ken, too - Stanley Colorite's partner Dennis Schlicker has 1,000 of Barbie's boyfriend, which is every version made in the States

Mr Colorite, who also designs his own Barbies for charity, bought his first Barbie, a Happy Holidays doll, in 1997.

Now he buys up to 20 a month from toy shops, jumble sales and eBay.

He said: 'I remember seeing her and thinking she was beautiful. I bought her straight away and it's just gone from there.

'If I see a Barbie or anything with the Barbie name on it I have to buy it.

'I've got everything from the toothpaste to a watch with her face on it.

The 1996 Pink Splendor Barbie, valued at $1000, is Mr Colorite's most treasured doll

Dolls from the Sixties are among Mr Colorite's favourites, including Wedding Day Barbie from 1963, left, and the oldest doll from 1962

The Billions of Dreams Barbie is one of the precious dolls displayed on a stand rather than in their box

'My favourite Barbie is a 1992 doll, 
she is worth $975. The oldest Barbie I have is from 1962 and I bought 
her at a second-hand sale for six dollars.'

Mr Colorite lives with his boyfriend, Dennis Schlicker, 61, who collects Ken dolls and now has every version made in America.

Since
 meeting 13 years ago, the couple have visited Barbie conventions 
together in the United States and they enjoy making jewellery for the 
dolls as well as curling the dolls' hair in their spare time.

Mr
 Schlicker said: 'When I first met Stanley he only had 150 dolls. They 
were all in their cases on the walls and it had to be the most I'd ever 
seen in one place before.

'Then I started collecting Kens and helping Stanley with his collection and it's just got bigger and bigger.'

The 1992 Neptune Fantasy doll is worth $750, left, while the Fantasy Goddess of Africa, both designed by Bob Mackie, is another treasured possession

Stanley Colorite's home in Hudson Florida houses 3,000 dolls with ane stimated worth of $80,000

Mr Colorite said: 'People walk in to my museum and their jaws just drop to the ground, they just don't know what to say.

'The Barbies take up four rooms of the house but I won't stop collecting until I run out of rooms.

'I'll glue them to the ceiling or make chandeliers out of them if I have to - but I wouldn't move home.

'I don't need a mansion for my museum. My house is my mansion, it's my own Barbie Dream House.'

The Fly Time Barbie set is among the collector's items as well as her friends and pets
