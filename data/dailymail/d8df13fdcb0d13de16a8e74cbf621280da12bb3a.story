Daniel Ricciardo is ready for the role of team leader at Red Bull, after a superb season that has seen him outperform reigning World Champion Sebastian Vettel.

Vettel is set to leave the team at the end of this season, but Ricciardo feels he is experienced enough to lead Red Bull to glory. 

The 25-year-old Australian has only been with the team for a year since his promotion from Torro Rosso, but says he can shoulder the extra responsibility.

Daniel Ricciardo believes he is ready to be the No 1 driver at Red Bull after an excellent first season

The Australian has out-performed his team-mate, World Champion Sebastian Vettel

'It's time now for me to take that role,' Ricciardo told Bleacher Report. 

'I'm not as experienced as Seb, but I feel I've definitely learned enough now that I can keep the team up at the front where they belong and help them out with developing [the car]. 

'I want to be racing at the front, so I'll do what I can to keep it there.'

Ricciardo is more than 50 points ahead of his German team-mate in the standings, and still technically in with a chance of denying Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg the title.

'It's mathematically still possible,' says Ricciardo, although realistically the 98-point gap to Hamilton is too much to bridge.

But he does look likely to finish above Vettel, despite not really being put ahead of his team-mate by Red Bull. 

However, Ricciardo seems unperturbed by the lack of help from team orders, and is determined to prove himself on the track, without any outside help.

'There haven't been any scenarios where I've really pushed and said, "Come on guys, do something—give me a team order."

The Australian knows that he is unlikely to compete for the title this year, but believes he can in years to come

'I think they've handled it well. I was behind Seb for a little bit in Russia, but then I boxed [made a pit stop]. 

'We sort of tried a different strategy and that got me in front. There hasn't really been a standout point where I was frustrated.

'I told the team as the season went on, "If there has to be some orders, OK," but I want to beat the guy in front on track and not have to rely on them.'
