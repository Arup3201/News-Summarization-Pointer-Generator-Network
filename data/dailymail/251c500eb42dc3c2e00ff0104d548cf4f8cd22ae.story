Guus Hiddink could find himself out of a job on Sunday night night - a mere 72 days after embarking on his second spell in charge of Holland.

The former Chelsea manager has pledged to resign if his Dutch team - who finished third at the World Cup under Louis van Gaal just four months ago - lose to Latvia in Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier here in Amsterdam.

Hiddink guided Holland to the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup during his initial tenure but his return has been far from happy with four defeats from five matches so far, including two qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Iceland.

And after Wednesday’s 3-2 home loss to Mexico in a friendly, Hiddink gloomily reiterated his promise made last weekend: ‘Yes, I will stand down if we lose to Latvia.’

Defeat to a team ranked No 99 in the world at the Amsterdam ArenA seems unthinkable but the Oranje are currently a pale imitation of the vibrant and free-flowing attacking force that blew away Spain and Brazil, among others, at the World Cup.

This was exposed by Mexico on Wednesday, with Carlos Vela and Javier Hernandez cutting through a shaky defence with ease and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar profligate in front of goal.

Hiddink, whose side sit third in qualifying Group A entering this year’s final round of matches, will try and rediscover that attacking verve against Latvia by partnering Huntelaar with Manchester United’s Robin van Persie, who is fully fit again.

Arjen Robben and Memphis Depay are set to be deployed on the wings as Hiddink pushes for a convincing display with plenty of goals.

Van Persie endorsed the plan and said the squad fully supports their under-fire manager. ‘Against Latvia, it sounds like a good plan. We have to win that game.

‘Anyway, we owe it to Hiddink. He is playing a poker game with his announcement that he is leaving with a defeat. We do not want to lose him.

‘You can view his remark differently, however. You could say it is because he has a lot of confidence in us.’

Aston Villa received a boost after Hiddink confirmed that Ron Vlaar’s calf injury suffered against Mexico is not a recurrence of the problem that caused the defender to miss matches for Feyenoord over the last two seasons.

With Vlaar not set to be risked against Latvia, Manchester City’s Karim Rekik, currently on loan at PSV Eindhoven, has been called up.
