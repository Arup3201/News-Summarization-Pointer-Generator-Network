Despite the best efforts of homemade homes guru Kirstie Alsopp, furnishing your home can sometimes feel like an expensive uphill struggle.

But one enterprising homeowner has managed to furnish her £1million home for nothing, after spending years scouring skips, auction houses and junk websites.

Jenny Carruthers, 45, has amassed a vast collection of bespoke furniture over the last decade and even managed to refurbish her kitchen without spending a penny.

Salvage: Furniture restorer Jenny Carruthers, 45, with her rescued and refurbished 1950s kitchen units

Recycled: Jenny personally designed her hardwood floor and picked up most of the wood from a salvage yard

Other eye-catching additions include hardwood flooring completely sourced from a salvage yard and a chair was made from her wedding dress.

Jenny said: 'There’s nothing more exciting than furnishing your home with items you want - exactly the way you want them.

'The best thing about your home is that it’s yours, and what better way to make it personal than by collecting material and turning it into something brilliant.

'Of course there can be genuine rubbish out there - but so many things thrown away have so much life in them. All you need is a bit of imagination, creativity and paper and pencil to help visualise it.'

Jenny, who runs a bespoke furniture store called Kiss The Frog Again, has turned her hand to reclaiming everything from furniture to fittings and insists that anything can be saved with some sanding and a lick of paint.

Rescued: Jenny's vibrant emerald green kitchen was being thrown away by its former owner 

Stunning: Jenny's kitchen chandelier was made from a recycled hay teddy and old jam jars

Pretty: Everything in the kitchen and the rest of the house came from scouring freecycle sites and salvage

Unusual: Jenny used a pair of recycled olive oil cans and a plank of wood to create this quirky kitchen bench

3. Wedding dress chair - material used to upholster dining chair4. Snowboard bench - two old snowboards screwed onto metal chair frames5. Black wooden door table with leopard print - old church door, sanded, 
painted and given funky pattern before legs secured to make it low table

Her favourite items include a red-painted church pew, luxury window chair made from old skirts and curtains, a 1950s retro kitchen repainted and repaired, a coat rack made from old skis, tractor seats turned into breakfast stools and New York City maps into 3D wall art.

Jenny added: 'Once you get into it the design opportunities just present themselves to you - of course it can be extremely tempting to just grab everything you come across, but it’s about balance.

'You must find what’s right for you and once you get going you can’t stop - it’s a good job I have a shop to sell things in otherwise my home would be overflowing.

'It’s just simple ideas. When you see something you like and you think ‘how can I use that?’ it’s everything I love to do.

'One of my favourite pieces has to be my wedding dress chair. When you get married it’s the most important thing you can wear but you only get to enjoy it for a limited time.This way I get the most use out of it and it’s just superb - it has such a romantic link to me.'

A keen chair fan, Jenny’s passion often revolves around identifying quirky new places to rest. She has upholstered chairs using car seat belts, old leather pants belts, skirts, curtains, old denim and even sports equipment.

Jenny said: 'Chairs are the beginning of all good things - we all love sitting down, so why not do it in style?

'The thing I always say to people is that you shouldn’t just run out and buy something when there’s a mountain of fantastic - and quite often better-made - things out there waiting for you for free.'
