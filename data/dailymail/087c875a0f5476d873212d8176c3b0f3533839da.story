A former butler insisted on his 
innocence and said he's scared to go to jail as he was sentenced today 
to 20 years in prison for trying to extort millions of dollars from 
philanthropist Anne H. Bass.

Emanuel Nicolescu, who was convicted in 
March of attempted extortion and other charges, said at his sentencing 
hearing that he had no role in the ordeal suffered by Bass and her 
companion at her western Connecticut estate - where she was injected with what masked intruders
claimed was a deadly virus during a night of terror in 2007.

'I am sorry for what they went through 
but I didn't do it,' said Nicolescu, who paused and fought back tears as
he spoke at length in federal court in New Haven.

Nicolescu noted that he is only 150 pounds.

'In jail I'm a target for a lot of things,' he said, asking for mercy. 'I'm scared.'

Authorities said the masked men injected
Bass and her partner, Julian Lethbridge, and refused to provide an 
antidote unless they turned over $8.5 million.

The injected substance 
turned out to be harmless, and the intruders fled without the cash.

'This lengthy sentence is appropriate 
for a defendant who participated in a violent home invasion,' said U.S. 
Attorney David Fein.

Alex Hernandez, an attorney for the victims, said the crime was profound and long-lasting.

'The perpetrators executed this crime 
with military precision and left no doubt about their intentions,' 
Hernandez said, reading a victim impact statement.

'The terror they 
inflicted was real and was clearly intended to be perceived as such. 
Anne and Julian believed that each moment could well be their last.'

The victims, who did not attend the 
sentencing, also live in constant fear that others involved in the crime
have not been captured. They said they hope Nicolescu will help 
authorities bring the others to justice.

'To date, he has not accepted any 
responsibility for what he did, he has expressed no remorse for what 
took place and he has done absolutely nothing to help bring others to 
justice,' the letter states. 'If he should now choose to do so, he will 
have earned a measure of forgiveness from them.'

Nicolescu is the only person who has 
been arrested for the crime at the estate in Kent, a scenic rural town 
of about 3,000 residents near New York.

He had been fired by Bass for 
wrecking a car about a year before the crime on April 15, 2007.

Authorities say at least four men were involved, including one outside the house.

The jury did not reach a finding on the 
role of Nicolescu or the others, so it's unclear whether they believed 
he was in the home, outside or elsewhere, said his attorney, Gerald 
McMahon.

A prosecutor said the jury did not make special findings as to 
Nicolescu's role, but authorities have argued they believed he was in 
the house.

Prosecutors said Nicolescu's DNA was found in a Jeep stolen from the property during the home invasion.

Bass, right, who testified against her butler last week, was married to Texas billionaire Sid Bass, left

Bass, the former wife of Texas 
billionaire Sid Bass, testified during the trial that she heard 'war 
cries' from men dressed in black who threw her to the floor, tied her up
and talked about whether to kidnap her three-year-old grandson.

She said she told the men the boy would be terrified to see them dressed in black.

'I spent a lot of time thinking about my
children and how horrible it was going to be for them because I was 
sure I was going to die,' said Bass, whose grandson was unharmed.

Nicolescu said the case was devastating 
to him and his family. His voice breaking, he said he would never hurt 
anyone and knew such a sum of money could not be obtained, especially at
night.

'I don't wish what happened to them on 
anybody,' he said. 'There has to be a way I can show the court, the 
world, everybody I'm not that person.'

Nicolescu said he did not receive a fair trial.

His attorney sought a sentence of no 
more than eight years, saying no one was seriously hurt. McMahon said 
Nicolescu had no prior criminal record and was described by many as 
sweet.

Prosecutors sought a sentence of about 
25 to 30 years, citing the emotional trauma suffered by the victims, the
painful nature of the injections and that Nicolescu was likely a leader
of the crime.

Bass also has homes in New York City and Fort Worth, Texas.
