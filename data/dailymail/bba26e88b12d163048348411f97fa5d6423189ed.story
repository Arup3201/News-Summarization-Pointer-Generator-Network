Two sisters were sent home from school because they were wearing badges to raise awareness of Marie Curie Cancer Care, the charity which has helped their terminally ill grandfather. 

Elise Casey, 13, was sent home with a note saying she had been excluded from school for the day, and warning her mother that she could receive a fixed penalty notice for her daughter's absence. 

The teenager's sister Keira, 12, was also sent home from the school in Sheffield because she was also wearing the charity's daffodil badge.

They had been wearing them in support of their granddad, David Paggiosi, 69, who was diagnosed with rare bile duct cancer that spread to his abdomen and is now inoperable.

Their mother Gina, 42, said: 'It upset my dad because he knew they were doing it to support him. They were distraught and are finding it hard to come to terms with what is happening to their granddad.

The housekeeper supervisior, who works at a care home, added: 'The girls had comments from teachers the week before and one teacher made the youngest take the badge off.

'They were sent straight home from school last Monday after being excluded for a day. The school rang me and I went home to find them sitting on the doorstep as they didn't have a house key.

The girls were excluded for a day after they refused to remove the badges, worn in support of their grandfather

Gina Casey said she had encouraged her daughters to return to school with the badges despite the incident

'They walked a mile from the school, through country lanes, which I wasn't happy about.

'The school haven't been in touch since. There has been no contact. They have not tried to speak to me at all.'

Ms Casey said she is still encouraging her daughters to wear their badges in support of their grandfather as well as the charity. The pair returned to Outwood Academy City, in Sheffield, the next day with their badges pinned to their school uniform. 

 

Outwood Academy sent the girls' mother a letter informing her they had been excluded for wearing the badges

The school said it had a strict policy on wearing badges, bit these could be fixed to pupils' coats and bags 

In a letter sent to their parents on October 20 by the acting principle, the school said: 'I am writing to

inform you of my decision to exclude Elise Casey for a fixed period of 1 day(s). This means that they will not be allowed in the Academy for this period.

'I realise that this exclusion may well be upsetting for you and your family, but the decision to exclude Elise has not been taken lightly. 

Bile duct cancer is a rare form of the disease, and can occur in the ducts inside or outside of the liver

There are around 1,000 new cases diagnosed every year 

It occurs in the ducts which carry bile - the substance responsible for helping break down fats so they can be digested

The cause of bile cancer is unknown but factors such as infection, chronic inflammatory bowel conditions and age can increase the likelihood of it developing

Symptoms include dark urine, itchy skin and the eyes and skin becoming yellow (jaundice)

It can also cause weight loss, abdomen pain and a high temperature or fever 

The main treatment for bile duct cancer is surgery

If the cancer is at an early stage this will involve removal of the bile ducts. If it is advanced the bile ducts, part of the stomach, part of the small bowel, the pancreas, gall bladder and the surrounding lymph nodes are all removed. This is called Whipple's Procedure and is major surgery.

Elise has been excluded for this fixed period because she refused to follow a reasonable request from a senior member of staff.

'I must advise you that you may receive a penalty notice from the local authority if your child is resent in a public place without reasonable justification.'

Their father, Mr Casey, 42, a steel fixer, added: 'The school is run like a prison anyway, they check the kids' bags at the gate every day.

'It seems to be a very strict regime.

'They really should have taken their circumstances into consideration - it wasnt like they were wearing One Direction badges, the daffodils are for a very, very good cause.'

Staff at the school say it has strict rules about pupils wearing charity badges on their school uniforms - though they are allowed on bags, bag straps or outdoor coats.

The former City School was taken over by Wakefield's Outwood Grange Academy Trust at the beginning of the year, the first secondary in the city to be run by a chain based outside the city.

A Trust spokeswoman said: 'We have an excellent track record of supporting a wide range of charities and encourage students to take part in charitable events and activities.

'Our policy is to request students to wear charity badges on either the bags,bag straps or outdoor coats but not as part of their school uniform.

'The only exception to this is when students purchase a poppy in the weeks leading up to Remembrance Day.'

Marie Curie Cancer Care provide nursing and care to people with terminal illnesses, supporting them in hospices and in their homes.
