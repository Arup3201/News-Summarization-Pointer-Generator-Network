A 19-year-old man has been charged with murder and aggravated assault in Philadelphia stabbings that killed his mother and left his grandmother clinging to life, after what neighbors have described as years of mistreatment.

Zachary Pritchett was arrested following the deadly incident early Friday at a home in the Bridesburg section of the city.

A police spokeswoman said officers responded to the home shortly after 6am Friday and found 53-year-old Melizza Wiley dead of multiple stab wounds to the face, neck and upper torso.

Crime scene: Zachary Pritchett, 19, was arrested following the deadly incident early Friday at a home in the Bridesburg section of Philadelphia 

House of horrors: Officers who responded to the family's residence found deplorable conditions inside, including no running water, no cooking gas and human feces smeared on the floor

Pritchett's 73-year-old grandmother, Joan Wiley, was taken to Aria Torresdale Hospital in critical but stable condition.

Police said Pritchett, who suffered a laceration to his hand, initially blamed the attack on three unknown men in hooded sweatshirts who he claimed had broken into their home, reported Fox29, but his version of events did not add up.

According to the family's neighbors, the 19-year-old was very troubled and the violent domestic attack was years in the making.

Area resident Kelly McGrath told 6ABC Melizza Wiley seldom allowed her son out of the house, and most nights he could be heard screaming from the back room.

Another neighbor, Stephanie Carbonaro, said on the eve of the killing, she and her house guests overheard Zachary Pritchett screaming at someone in the house, 'Please, leave me alone. Don't do this. Let go.'

Officers who responded to the family's residence found deplorable conditions inside, including no running water, no cooking gas and human feces smeared on the floor.

Throughout the day Saturday, investigators were seen coming in and out of the house wearing full protective gear and surgical masks.  

Melizza Wiley died after sustaining multiple stab wounds to the face, neck and upper torso, while her mother was critically wounded. Neighbors say the attack was years in the making 

Melizza Wiley was found stabbed in the living room and was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.27am. Joan Wiley was discovered wounded in a hospital-type bed.

Police said they have a history with the family and have responded to the home no fewer than a dozen times within the past year alone.

Neighbors said they have contacted the Department of Human Services multiple times because they were concerned for Zachary Pritchett’s welfare.

Kelly McGrath also reached out to the local school board to inquire about the 19-year-old’s education because Melizza Wiley was supposed to be home-schooling her son, but the neighbor was convinced she was not doing it.
