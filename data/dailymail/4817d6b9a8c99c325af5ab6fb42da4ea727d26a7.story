The woman at the centre of the Francis Abbott scholarship scandal has landed an internship with the Australian Greens after beating out more than 160 applicants for the job.

Freya Newman escaped a jail sentence in November after she pleaded guilty to accessing details of Ms Abbott's $60,000 scholarship at the Whitehouse Institute of Design.

Newman then leaked these documents to journalists and led to the intense media scrutiny of how the prime minister's daughter landed the merit.

Newman pleaded guilty in November to accessing the files about a $60,000 Whitehouse Design Institute scholarship given to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's daughter Frances (pictured) in 2011

NSW Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon confirmed Newman would be starting her two-day-per-week, paid internship in April.

And it seems Newman is extremely eager to start her new role as part of one of Australia's major political parties.

'I'm really excited to be working with Senator Rhiannon and the rest of her staff this year on issues like higher education, aid and animal welfare,' she told Buzzfeed Australia.

But her part in the Frances Abbott scandal did not sway the senator's decision to hire Newman for the Sydney-based position.

'In November 2014, my office opened applications for a part-time, paid internship position,' Senator Rhiannon said via an email statement.

'Following an extensive application process involving over 160 applicants and two rounds of interviews we offered the position to Freya.

'Freya was an outstanding applicant and we are very much looking forward to having her on board.' 

The news caused controversy because the institute's chairman Les Taylor is a friend of Frances Abbott's father, Prime Minister Tony Abbott

Newman was handed a two-year good behaviour bond in Sydney after she leaked files to the media 

The emergence of the leaked documents sparked widespread protests as it raised questions about how Ms Abbott landed her scholarship as the institute's chairman, Les Taylor, is a friend of Prime Minister Tony Abbott and donor to the Liberal Party.

While handing down her sentence in November, Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan said she did not think Newman was 'motivated by a sense of injustice, rather than notoriety... or greed'.

Ms Newman faced a maximum custodial sentence of two years imprisonment.

Ms O'Sullivan said Ms Newman's offence was at the 'lowest end' of the scale and told a courtroom cramped with media and supporters that the university communications student had 'good prospects of rehabilitation'.

Supporters gathered outside Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney, calling for Newman to be 'freed', as she was sentenced inside

But while the magistrate added that Ms Newman's actions had done harm to the community and the victim, she told the court the  university student had not accessed sensitive documents, just material that was not in the public domain.

'She made no attempt to conceal her actions and resigned from the institution the following day,' the magistrate said.

Ms O'Sullivan said other Whitehouse staff members had briefed Ms Newman in how she could access documents that detailed Ms Abbott's scholarship by using another staff member's log-in.

Isolated protesters held up placards of support for Newman and condemnation of the Abbott family prior to the hearing.
