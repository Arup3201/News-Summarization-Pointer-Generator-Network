For many people, becoming a parent is the most important task in life. For one MP, however, children are simply the ‘opium of the masses’.

Conservative backbencher Rory Stewart has hit out at people who think of their offspring as their ‘purpose’ in life – despite admitting he would like to become a father himself.

He said: ‘If we say the purpose of life is our children, that’s neither a purpose nor a meaning. But I’m sure I will be as besotted as everybody else when I have them.’

Playing on revolutionary Karl Marx’s infamous statement that ‘religion is the opium of the masses’, Mr Stewart described children as the new ‘opium’.

His comments come just five months after he criticised society for worshipping children as they once worshipped God. On that occasion he also compared children to ‘opium’, but focused his attack on society’s tendency to prioritise the needs of young people over the elderly.

It is not known what the 41-year-old’s wife Shoshana Clark, 33, will make of his comments, which he made in an interview with the Radio Times.

The pair, who have been married for almost two years, have yet to have children of their own.

They first met when she and her first husband, an aid worker, moved to work for the Turquoise Mountain Foundation, a charity Mr Stewart set up in 2006.

She became its chief executive a few months later and moved in with him after ditching her husband in 2010.

Mr Stewart, who is MP for Penrith and the Border, has made a documentary about the boundary between Scotland and England for BBC2, called The Story of Britain’s Lost Middleland.

Before entering Parliament, he served as a soldier and a diplomat and wrote a book about his experiences walking across Afghanistan.

Mr Stewart said his life is ‘slower’ now he is an MP, adding: ‘Being a backbench MP is a bit of an anti-climax for a superhero.’

And he said politicians have less power than many voters realised: ‘The politicians think the journalists have power, the journalists think bankers have power, bankers think lawyers have power.

The truth is, nobody has power.’

The MP – who is Scottish – is campaigning against Scottish independence and thinks Hadrian’s Wall is a ‘pernicious scar across the landscape’.

But he said he was unable to talk about his campaign while promoting his new documentary because it ‘might put the BBC in a difficult position’.

He added: ‘I think I probably began filming feeling that what the programme would discover was that there was a strong sense of British identity and that there would be no difference either side of the border.

‘But I found that Scottishness and Englishness are actually strong, instinctive things, whatever the historical reasons. Even the accent changes – just two inches across the border.’
