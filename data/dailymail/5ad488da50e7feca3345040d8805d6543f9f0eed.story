Encouraged by TV chefs such as Nigella Lawson and Gordon Ramsay, Britons are eating more halloumi than any other nation besides the Cypriots who make it.

Some 3,030 tonnes of the cheese were imported into the UK last year.

This was more than the next top European importers – Sweden, at 1,280 tonnes, Germany (870) and Austria (510) – put together.

Craze: Brits are scrambling for the cheese, made of goats or ewes milk, instead of the usual cheddar

Tesco’s sales of its own-brand halloumi are up by 132 per cent.

More is also being sold at restaurants, with Nando’s recording a rise of 138 per cent since 2010.

Halloumi is made from a mixture of goat’s and sheep’s milk and its high melting point means it can be fried, grilled or barbecued.

It is also packaged in brine, which means it can be stored unopened in the fridge for up to a year whilst giving it a unique salty taste.

Greek cheese is flying off the shelves in UK supermarkets. 3,030 tonnes of halloumi were imported last year

Cheese specialist Neil Burchell said: ‘It’s easy to see why halloumi has done so well – it’s delicious fried, grilled or barbecued.’

To accomodate for the rise, Tesco has doubled their range of Greek cheese.

They now stock and sell six different varieties and sales of feta cheese are also soaring in the UK.

Tesco cheese buyer Ashleigh MacFarlane said: 'We started selling one type of feta and one type of halloumi about 10 years ago in our larger stores.

'The majority of sales would come during the summer months as they were then mainly bought to go in salads.

The high melting point of the Greek cheese makes it perfect for grilling, frying and barbecuing

Fried cheese, or saganaki, with shrimps is a traditional Greek dish that is making its way across Europe

'But demand has really been boosted by celebrity chefs such as Nigella Lawson, Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay who have featured these cheeses on their TV shows and in their recipe books.

'These programmes have helped demonstrate the versatility of these cheeses which are now often used in cooking to make pizzas, pies and lasagne as well as making great toppings for pasta dishes.'

With rising demand, Cyprus is seeking ‘protected designation of origin’ status for halloumi in Europe. This would lay down criteria a cheese would have to meet to be labelled halloumi.

However the process has so far failed, resulting in big clashes as to how to make the cheese.

Traditional Halloumi is made from a mixture of goat’s and sheep’s milk, but with no PDO to regulate its creation many varieties can also contain cow’s milk.
