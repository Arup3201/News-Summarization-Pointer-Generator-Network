A fire which broke out in the home of a missing teenager may have been arson, police believe.

Detectives probing the suspicious blaze at the home of Erica Parsons, in Salisbury, North Carolina, suspect a microwave may have been sabotaged to explode into flames.

Erica Parsons has not been seen since she left the home of her parents Casey and Sandy Parsons, who adopted her - their niece - in November 2011.

Where is she? Erica's brother said he last saw her in November 2011 when he reported her missing on July 30

The case of missing Erica has gripped a nation after her adoptive parents claimed she was living with her grandmother, 'Nan', only for her biological mother to insist no such person exists.

Now in a new twist, investigators returned to the house on Miller Chapel Road, from which Mr and Mrs Parsons had recently been evicted, to carry out further tests.

The fire started on Wednesday, last week, when owner William Parsons turned the power back on after carrying out an extensive refurbishment to the property.

Anger: The Parsons say they left her with 'Nan' as she was happier there and did not want to see them

Suspicions over the fire have now fallen on an unnamed family member, who was allegedly heard boasting of being able to start a house fire with a microwave.

No one has been arrested or charged in the fire, or is even considered a suspect.

William Parsons told WCNC.com: 'I heard some cracking and went back up in the house, and the microwave was on fire,'

1998: Erica Lynn Parsons, age 2 weeks, is taken in by Casey and Sandy Parsons, who have three children of their own. She is the biological child of Sandy Parsons’ brother’s wife.

2000: The Parsonses officially adopt Erica in Cabarrus County

1999-2011: The couple have two more children, Brooke and Toby.

February 2010: William James Parsons, 16, the couple’s biological son, is arrested for biting his younger brother.

August 2011: James Parsons is charged with two counts of assault, animal cruelty and assault on a minor. Charges are dismissed when Casey Parsons does not appear in court.

Nov. 19, 2011: The Parsonses take Erica to a McDonald’s in Mooresville to catch a ride to the Asheville home of her biological grandmother, Irene 'Nan' Goodman.

December 2011: The Parsonses say on her third visit to Asheville, Erica calls home and says she doesn’t want to live with them anymore.

2012: Casey Parsons files a missing persons report for her daughter, Brooke.

July 30, 2013: After his parents kick him out, James Parsons contacts the Rowan County Sheriff’s Office and reports that Erica has been missing for two years.

August 2013: After undergoing two days of questioning by investigators, the Parsonses hire attorney Carlyle Sherrill.

Aug. 5, 2013: The Rowan Sheriff’s Office issues a missing/endangered persons alert for Erica.

He believes it was an accident.

Investigators confirmed the second set of tests were in order to be able to rule sabotage in or out.

Casey Parsons says the family had electrical problems caused by the microwave several times before.

Erica's adoptive parents insisted they were not worried about her safety because they believed she was with 'Nan' - even though it later emerged that both of Erica's biological grandmothers were in fact dead.

The missing teen's biological mother Carolyn Parsons has spoken out against the couple's claims, saying she will not give up looking for her daughter, who is now 15.

'I'm in somebody's nightmare and they will not wake up and let me out,' she previously told WBTV.

Casey and Sandy's lawyer, Carlyle Sherrill, said that it was Carolyn who introduced Erica to 'Nan', adding: 'That's who brought Nan to them and probably knows who Nan is.'

But Carolyn said: 'Nan and Irene don't exist. The only two people that know the truth are the only two people that won't give the truth.'

She also said she had not wanted to hand her daughter over to her in-laws, but felt she had to because she was unable to bring up the child properly.

'No mother wants to have children and just give them up,' she said. 'I didn't want to. She didn't deserve the life that I had.'

Carolyn says she has not seen Erica since January 2011, 10 months before she went missing.

A polygraph test carried out on Sandy Parsons was found to be 'strongly deceptive' when he described how he had nothing to do with her disappearance.

Sandy and his wife Casey appeared on Dr Phil's show two weeks ago to defend themselves against claims they murdered and abused adoptive their daughter.

Investigators are hunting for information about the whereabouts and the disappearance of Erica.
