Smuggled alcohol costs the taxman more than £1billion a year - but no more than six criminals are prosecuted every year, MPs said last night.

Customs officials were lambasted last night for its lax enforcement regime which means just 20 people have been convicted for dodging alcohol tax over four years.

The failure by HM Revenue and Customs to take effective action against criminal gangs means the Treasury loses out to the tune of £1.2billion a year.

MPs on the powerful Public Accounts Committee said the department did not have good enough information about how effective it was at tackling the problem and failed to make the best use of intelligence and technology to detect and prevent evasion.

And the criticised the HMRC for having no idea about the extent of the tax gap for wine - making it impossible to target enforcement action against wine.

MPs said they had been told criminals often export duty unpaid alcohol then redirect it back to the UK to sell.

The report revealed that between 2006/07 and 2009/10, the highest number of successful prosecutions in any one year was six, and the highest number of defendants was 16.

It concluded that the HMRC does not 
take enough account of the deterrent effect of successful prosecutions 
when considering the cost and benefits of pursuing perpetrators through 
the courts.

Richard 
Bacon, an MP on the committee, said: 'HMRC's drive to tackle alcohol 
duty evasion is being seriously hampered by a lack of information.

MP Richard Bacon, who sits on the Public Accounts Committee, criticised HMRC for its lack of information regarding alcohol duty evasion

'Alcohol fraud is big business. The department estimates that the gap between taxes due on alcohol and the amount actually collected might be as large as £1.2billion.

'The department does not, however, 
have enough reliable information on the returns from tackling different 
types of alcohol duty evasion.

'It
cannot say, therefore, whether a more effective targeting of its 
resources might not secure a better return on its investment.

'It
is unacceptable that the department has still to produce an estimate of
the tax gap for wine, despite a commitment to this committee's 
predecessors to do so.

'The
absence of information on the scale and nature of wine duty fraud 
undermines the basis on which the department directs its resources to 
tackling the problem.'

He added: 'Since the criminal gangs who 
perpetrate major alcohol duty fraud operate across national boundaries, 
the department needs to strengthen its intelligence by developing better
links with the industry, the UK Border Force and other EU member 
states.

'The department seems to be reluctant to
prosecute offenders. Over a recent four year period, there were 
successful prosecutions in no more than six cases a year.

'This sends the wrong message to perpetrators and the wider public about the department's commitment to reducing alcohol duty evasion.

'It should give more weight to the deterrent impact of pursuing perpetrators through the courts.'
