A British teacher who went on to become the Grand Master of the Order of Malta has taken the first step towards becoming a saint.

The Vatican have officially opened a cause for the sainthood for Andrew Bertie, a distant cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, who died in Rome in 2008.

Bertie was the first Englishman to be elected to the post of Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, which comes with the title of prince and is equivalent to a cardinal, in the Order's 900 year history.

He will now be known as a Servant of God. But to become a saint it must now be shown that he demonstrated ‘heroic virtue’ during his life.

In order to become a saint, two miracles attributable to him would have to be found.

Bertie reformed the order recognising the importance of its diplomatic corp and built up the numbers of their humanitarian ambassadors. He founded the order of young volunteers in the UK.

Friends say he showed signs of heroic virtue, one of the primary requirements for sainthood, and led an 'exemplary' life.

Matthew Festing, the current Grad Master said: 'His personality was quiet –that famous British reserve! – but he had a natural authority and a serenity deeply rooted in his Christian beliefs. He also had a fine sense of humour – a quiet amusement at the ridiculousness of much of life. 

'Those who were privileged to have worked around him were always aware of his calmness and his profound faith,' he added.

Taking the first step: The Vatican - headed by Pope Francis - has officially opened a cause for the sainthood for Andrew Bertie, a distant cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2008

Friends said he would be ‘gasping’ if he knew he was on track for sainthood. 'His modesty would find it difficult to cope with,' one said.

Ampleforth and Oxford-educated Bertie taught languages at Worth school after a spell as a journalist and in the army. 

He joined the Knights of Malta in 1956 and then, in 1981, became a professed Knight, living under solemn vows of poverty chastity and obedience.

He would regularly tend to the sick himself he and was even known to work anonymously in a Rome hospital as a ward orderly, according to friends.

Bertie was on his father’s side a grandson of the 7th Earl of Abingdon, and on his mother’s, of the Marquess of Bute - a direct descendant of the Stuart line of monarchs.

But before they can, the Church must find two 'miracles' attributable to him
