A judge has spoken of his ‘utmost despair’ over a £50million engineering dynasty ‘tearing itself apart’ in a costly divorce battle.

Susan Shield, 69, is divorcing her tycoon husband Richard, 72, after 43 years of marriage, but fears she and their three daughters face losing millions because he plans to pass the bulk of his business to their only son, Christopher, 35.

Judge Sir James Holman  made his rare expression of personal sorrow over the ‘extremely tragic’ case because costs are already set to hit £1million even though it has barely begun.

Acrimonious split: Engineering tycoon Richard Shield, 72, left, and his wife Susan, 69, left, are locked in a High Court battle over the future of the family fortune which he wants to leave to their only son, Christopher, 35

The family is engaged in what he described as ‘intense conflict’ over Mr Shield’s plans for his engineering firm, founded by his late father Arthur in 1949.

And Mrs Shield – who has already secured a decree nisi but not yet a decree absolute – is particularly concerned by her estranged husband’s actions because he has had psychiatric problems and been placed under ‘compulsory detainment’.

A neighbour last night said that Mr Shield had ‘so much money he doesn’t know what to do with it’.

But despite his millions, his main cars are an ageing Range Rover, a 1960s Mini and a pick-up truck.

'Despair': Mr Justice Holman has spoken of his disappointment over the furious legal battle which is destroying a wealthy family

He is currently back in the former 
marital mansion next to one of their factories, in Queniborough, 
Leicestershire, while Mrs Shield is living with one of their three 
daughters – Alexandra, 40, Nicola, 38, and Fiona, 30.

Yesterday
 at the High Court, in a ruling on the case following arguments about Mr
 Shield’s legal representation, Mr Justice Holman said: ‘I have been 
faced with a situation that is extremely tragic and appears unedifying.’

He
 said that while Mrs Shield had an agreed share of  5 per cent – 
£2.5million – of their fortune, there was dispute over whether the whole
 £50million was being held in trust for their only son, Christopher.

Decisions
 over the fortune’s future made by Mr Shield some years ago, said the 
judge, ‘appear to have favoured the son in preference to the daughters 
and to be to the disadvantage of the wife’.

At
 the end of the hearing yesterday, Mr Justice Holman said: ‘I have to 
say, as I leave this very long day, that I do so with a feeling of the 
utmost despair that this family could have spent three quarters of a 
million pounds just to get to this stage.

‘This
 family appears to be tearing itself apart, and it fills the sympathetic
 but detached observer such as myself with nothing but despair.’

The case is due to reopen later this month. Richard and Christopher Shield yesterday declined to discuss the hearing.

'Tragic': A High Court hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, pictured, heard how the 43-year marriage of Richard and Susan Shield was ending with an argument over money

Local restaurateur David Van Hien, 46, said Richard Shield was well-known in the area.

He
 added: ‘He’s quite a character. He’s absolutely eccentric but a 
likeable chap. He wears a flat cap and is sometimes scruffily dressed. 
He has so much money he doesn’t know what to do with it.’

Last
 night a source close to the family said: ‘I totally endorse the judge’s
 words – just chucking money at lawyers like this is absolutely stupid.

‘It all comes down to the whole business being signed over to Christopher.

‘But
 an angry woman will stop at nothing to get her share of the spoils – 
even if those spoils are going to be depleted by her activities.’
