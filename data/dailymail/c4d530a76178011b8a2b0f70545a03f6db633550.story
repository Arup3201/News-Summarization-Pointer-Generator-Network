A US Marine has been charged with the murder of a fellow military man whose body was found shoved inside a zipped up sleeping bag in the back of his car last month.

Kevin Albert Richard Coset, 23, a corporal in the marine corps, was arrested in California's Camp Pendleton on Friday night and taken into custody in connection with the murder of Alvin Bulaoro, 24.

Bulaoro, a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve, was found dead on January 3 inside a 1997 Toyota 4Runner parked outside a supermarket in Fallbrook.

The body was 'zipped up in a sleeping bag and had signs of trauma,' Lt. Glenn Giannantonio with the sheriff's department homicide unit told the Los Angeles Times. The death was immediately deemed suspicious.

It is unclear whether the two knew each other or what motive there was for the slaying.

Bulaoro's family had reported him missing on December 21, 2012.

His brother told NBC News
they had hired a private investigator to search for the young man. The 
investigator spotted Bulaoro's car outside the supermarket and alerted 
the family who called police.

The man's mother, Josephine Bulaoro, was seen crying hysterically at the scene, after his body was discovered inside the car.

'I want justice for my son,' she told NBC in January.

Bulaoro, an immigrant from the Philippines, was enlisted in the Navy for four years and worked as a human resources officer at Camp Pendleton, NBC News reported. There he helped Marines with pay, benefits and housing issues.

While in the Navy, he got his bachelor's degree and later became a lieutenant in the Army Reserves.

He also worked as an administrator for his family's health-care business.

According to NBC, he had returned from training in Texas in November and was due to participate in a ceremony for his commission in Los Angeles on January 12.

'He told me, "Mom you're going to be very proud of me,"' his mother told NBC.

Coset was booked at 12:53 a.m. Saturday and jailed without bail at the Vista Detention Facility.
