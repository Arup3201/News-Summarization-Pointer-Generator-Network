From Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's beloved green juice to Miranda Kerr's favourite Noni juice, the two models are walking adverts for the power of vitamins and super fruits. 

When the A-listers came out in support of clean juices, the world converted to all things green quicker than you could say kale. 

And now, a new beauty drink that claims to boost your health and your beauty regime in one hit is set to take the health world by storm (and the models backstage at fashion week have already jumped on the bandwagon).

Miranda Kerr, left, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have long preached the power of the green juice. And now, one Spanish company are combining the power of superfoods and anti-ageing benefits of collagen into a tipple that claims to boost your health and beat wrinkles 

Beauty & Go is a range of drinks packed with bioactives - biologically active substances that have a positive effect in your body and skin.

The drinks, which are gluten-free, claim to be filled with a selection of bioactive ingredients aimed at keeping your skin healthy and glowing.

The ingredients, which are called Macro-Antioxidants and occur naturally in the skin of fruits such as olives and pomegranates, aim to protect cells against  free radicals (the main cause of ageing), as well as stimulate skin regeneration and boost skin’s firmness and elasticity.

The brand's researchers claim the effect of Macro-Antioxidants on our system is long-lasting (three times longer than conventional antioxidants).

The tipples, which contain under 100 calories and are made by a Spanish company, are also enriched with other beauty ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and collagen, which are well-known for their skin firming properties.

As well as the wrinkle-beating ingredients, the drinks, which cost £2.99 each and are launching in Selfridges in March, are full of celebrity-approved superfoods. They are sweetened using stevia - a natural plant extract.

It seems that the trend for beauty-boosting drinks is taking off and Beauty & Go aims to combine the nation's penchant for health drinks with beauty benefits

There are four options and the anti-ageing and radiance ones claims to be packed with ingredients to help beat wrinkles and keep skin glowing.

The detox variety is akin to a green juice and, say the brand, will be your greatest ally when your skin needs to recover from a few days of excess. It promises to help stimulate metabolism and contribute to toxin elimination, thanks to cucumber, spirulina algae, broccoli, spinach, mint and nettle. 

The vitality option, meanwhile, contains pineapple, ginkgo biloba and guarana and claims to boost energy levels. 

The makers suggest drinking one a day for a month to see results, but are the drinks just another health fad promising the key to eternal youth? 

Michela Vagnini, Nutritional Therapist at Nature’s Plus, isn't convinced.

'This drinks range looks more marketing-based than science-based,' she said. 

'The website states the drinks have been used in a clinical trial but the only information on the website points to a 56-day trial of only 30 people. 

‘The website mentions Macro-Antioxidants are used but it doesn't specify which anti-oxidants are included. Antioxidant is a general name that by itself means very little.'

It seems that the trend for beauty-boosting drinks is taking off. Beauty’in beauty drink offers a similar anti-ageing infusion, which is full of hibiscus, grape and acai and collagen, designed to keep skin looking healthy.

Neal's Yard Remedies offer a similar new product - but theirs comes in powder form and can be used to make up a drink or added to juices and smoothies.

The brand's Organic Greens Complex is apparently packed full of vitamin C with ingredients like acerola cherry, which is renowned for its collagen boosting properties. It also is full of spirulina, spinach and parsley powder.
