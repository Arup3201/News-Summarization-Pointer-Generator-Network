A bevy of celebrities are hosting a pricey fundraiser for President Obama Monday night at the Connecticut home of famed producer Harvey Weinstein and his fashion designer wife Georgina Chapman.

Though the President is often criticised over his close connections to Hollywood, he is facing more of a firestorm over the location of the dinner.

Two popular Westport, Connecticut beaches will be closed this evening so that the President's helicopter can park on the grounds when it arrives for the fundraiser.

Commotion over closing: The Sherwood Island Beach in Westport, Connecticut was closed Monday night because the President's helicopter was due to land there so he could attend a fundraiser nearby

FoxNews.com reports that both the 238-acre Sherwood Island State Park and the 2-acre Burying Hill Beach will be closed to accommodate the White House's needs. Burying Hill Beach is directly next to the Weinstein property.

'This is the height of hypocrisy,' Republican Connecticut state legislator Lawrence F. Cafero Jr. told the site. 

'Can you imagine if George W. Bush in 2004 had requested that our Republican governor shut down the park? It would have made national news. This is wrong in so many ways.'

The closure of the park- while likely based on security issues- angered a number of Tea Party supporters gathered in protest of the President's visit.

'It was a little bit selfish of the 
President. Big ego, "I need this park." He couldn't find a better place 
to park? Maybe he needs to drive a little farther?' protester Mark 
Conrad told The Hartford Courant.

'There's very little tourism in Connecticut and this is one of the big locations, and he says "It's mine today."'

In addition to Weinstein and Chapman, Bloomberg News reports that the dinner for 60 people will be co-hosted by actress Anne Hathaway, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, and Vogue editor Anna Wintour.

While the entire guest list is not known explicitly, legendary actor Paul Newman's widow Joanne Woodward- who lives in Westport- is expected to be one of the attendees who ponied up $38,500 for a ticket.

Before tucking into the dinner, Mr Obama will be speaking at a larger fundraiser at the Stamford, Connecticut Marriott. Up to 500 people will be in attendance and those tickets begin at $500-per-person.

In total, the evening is expected to bring in $2.5million for the President's re-election campaign, which comes the same day as July fundraising totals were released to show that Mr Obama is trailing his Republican opponent by a significant margin.

For the third month in a row, Mitt Romney raised more money than the sitting President, bringing in $101million last month. Mr Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee raised $75milion.

Though such sums are nothing to be laughed at, the pace at which Mr Romney is outraising Mr Obama comes as a surprise given his success during the 2008 campaign.

The Associated Press reports that Mr 
Romney's fundraising success this summer was the first time that Mr 
Obama was outraised by a competitor since 2007.

In spite of emailed pleas for continued 
donations by the President himself, Democratic advisors and supporters 
are not overly concerned about the spending differentials.

Consultants told the newswire that if anything, the fact that Mr Romney's camp is outraising Mr Obama's campaign simply means that Mr Obama will have to rely more heavily on the fundraising powers of surrogates while he continues the daily work at the White House. In the final monts before the election, he will likely focus more time on large events and rallies where his presence can be more easily viewed.

Raking it in: Mitt Romney, who is currently at his home in New Hampshire, outraised Mr Obama for the third month in a row, bringing in $101million in July

Bumpy ride: In spite of the public outrage over the event, Mr Obama's campaign is expected to raise $2.5million from the evening's line up

Former President Bill Clinton, also known for his fundraising finesse, will host a campaign event in New York next week, and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a number of fundraisers on behalf of her husband including one this weekend at the Hollywood home of No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stefani.

While Mr Obama has significantly more famous friends than Mr Romney- Bloomberg reports that $3.2million has been raised for the President by donors in the film and music industries- Mr Romney did get verbal endorsement by actor Clint Eastwood and former porn star Jenna Jameson over the weekend.

No word yet on how much those two endorsements raised for the Republican campaign.

During the dinner, President Obama took a moment to thank the various hosts who headlined the Connecticut dinner. These are his remarks:

Thank you, everybody. Well, it is wonderful to be here. And there are just a couple of people I want to acknowledge. First of all, obviously Harvey and Georgina have just been great friends and have done so much for us -- not just in this election, but in the previous one. A couple of other people who I want to mention -- your Governor, Dan Malloy, is here, who's doing outstanding work here in Connecticut.

I want to thank Anne Hathaway for taking the time to host us. She's spectacular. And I did get a chance to see Batman. And she was the best thing in it. That's just my personal opinion. Aaron Sorkin, who writes the way every Democrat in Washington wished they spoke. Aaron, thank you.

And Joanne Woodward -- what a treat this is. Joanne and Paul were not only I think what was best about American film, but also just embodied the American spirit in so many ways. And their love story and the way they took so many people under their wing and helped so many people I think made them something more important than just folks in film. And for her to be here, what a great treat that is. So thank you so much for taking the time. Thank you.
