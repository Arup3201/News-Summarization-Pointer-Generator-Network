When wheelchair-bound grandmother Kay Ennis saw a young man spitting on the pavement as they waited at a bus stop she decided to give him a piece of her mind.

But the dressing down turned into a furious row which ended with the  58-year-old driving over the man’s foot in her electric wheelchair.

Police were called and Mrs Ennis was charged with assault.

Ordeal: Kay Ennis was charged with assault after berating a man who had spat on the pavement

Yesterday, the frail grandmother, who is recovering from a brain haemorrhage that has left her with poor sight and partially deaf, condemned the decision to take the matter to court, where she was given a  12-month conditional discharge.

After pleading guilty only because she wanted to avoid going through a trial, she said: ‘Driving over someone’s foot in an electric wheelchair could hardly be called an assault. It is ridiculous.’

The incident happened last December as Mrs Ennis was  waiting to board a bus in Walkden, near Manchester.

Shahan Hannan, 25, was waiting with his girlfriend, Amy Budgen, 23, when he spat on the pavement. Outraged, Mrs Ennis, from Walkden, remonstrated with Mr  Hannan. She said: ‘All I did was ask the man to stop spitting. It was making me feel sick.’

Mrs Ennis said she had just taken her anti-epilepsy medication, which she relies on to prevent her having fits and losing consciousness.

She said: ‘I didn’t want to be sick. If I am sick, I don’t know how much medication I have in me. The last time it happened I ended up in a coma. I felt really scared.’

Foot 'attack': Kay Ennis, 58, ran over Shahan Hannan's foot at a bus stop on this road in Walkden

Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard that after Mrs Ennis ran over Mr Hannan’s foot, the grandmother allegedly slapped Miss Budgen’s face.

Austin Welsh, defending, told the court that Mrs Ennis accepted running over Mr Hannan – who claimed he was spitting to clear his throat – but that she had merely pushed his partner away when she got too close during the confrontation.

Sentencing Mrs Ennis, Judge  Jeffrey Lewis said: ‘I am sure everyone concerned wishes that the clock could be turned back.’

Mrs Ennis said: ‘The ordeal has dragged on for a year and had a really bad effect on my health.

‘This didn’t need to go to court – I’m not some sort of criminal.’
