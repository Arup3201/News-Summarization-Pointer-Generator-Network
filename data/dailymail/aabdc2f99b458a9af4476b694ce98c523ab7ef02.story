Lupe Villanueva and Frank Ybarra have crossed paths several times over the past 20 years, but it was not until a few months ago that they found out they were siblings - and the revelation could not have come at a more critical time.

Mrs Villanueva, of Oxnard, California, said reuniting with her long-lost brother was the product of divine intervention because it gave her a chance to save his life by donating a kidney to him.

The surgery took place June 24 at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Both Ybarra and Villanueva said the life-saving operation marked the beginning of their relationship.

Ybarra, 53, and Villanueva, 54, grew up in the same neighborhood in Oxnard but never met as children.

The woman was adopted and raised by a different family. She had spent 20 years searching for her biological parents, but without much success.

About three years into her quest, Villanueva got a first clue about her brother, but initially misinterpreted it, reported Fox News Latino.

One day at work, the woman and her colleagues were comparing their baby pictures when a friend remarked that Villanueva bore strong resemblance to her husband.

Villanueva became convinced that her co-worker's husband, Frank Ybarra, was her cousin.

It was not until 17 years later that she got an unexpected call from her half-sister revealing to her that Ybarra was actually her brother.

The shocking discovery was compounded by the fact that Ybarra was suffering from a life-threatening medical condition and was in need of a kidney transplant.

Together again: Frank and Lupe learned they were biological siblings in October 2013

Villanueva has known since age 8 that she had been adopted, 8, but her brother had thought that the people who raised him were his biological parents

The 53-year-old Oxnard man has been on daily dialysis since 2012 when he experienced kidney failure due to diabetes.

With a B+ blood type not shared by anyone in his family, Ybarra’s wait time for a donor kidney was eight to 10 years.

But then came a fateful meeting with his newfound sister, who volunteered to give him one of her kidney. At first, Ybarra was hesitant.

‘I said, “Lupe, it’s not like you’re passing a shoe on to me,”’ he recalled, but Villanueva was not to be dissuaded.

‘We’re actually going to be really part of each other now,' he said.

The surgery was a success, and on June 27 Ybarra celebrated his 53rd birthday.

First clue: Nearly two decades ago, Villanueva first realized she may be related to Ybarra when her co-worker saw her baby picture and told her that she looked just like her husband

Lupe and Frank's story has the makings of a telenovela script, complete two adopted babies, roiling family drama and swirling rumors about siblings separated at birth.

Lupe Villanueva learned she was adopted at age 8. After doing some digging, she found out that the names of her birth parents were Lala and Cliserio.

As she was searching for her birth parents, Villanueva heard whispers that her parents also had a son who had been adopted out like her.

When in 1996 her friend and co-worker pointed out that in her childhood picture Villanueva looked just like her husband, the two concluded that Ybarra must be her cousin because everyone thought at the time that Cliserio - Lupe's birth father - was Frank's uncle.

As it emerged later on, the Ybbaras, Frank's adoptive parents, were unable to conceive, and so when Lala - Lupe Villanueva’s birth mother - became pregnant with a boy, Cliserio made the decision to give the newborn to his sister and her husband.

Lala told the family that she also had had a daughter who had died in childbirth a year earlier.

Some time later, Frank's adoptive mother heard of a female cousin who was trying to reunite with their family, and so she arranged a meeting between Lupe and Lala.

But when the two women came face to face in the mid-90s, both remained in the dark about the fact that they were mother and daughter.

Two years later, Lupe got to meet her biological father, Cliserio, but she decided to not 'open a can of worms' about the past. Both Lala and Cliserio have since passed away.

Comedy of errors: The siblings thought for a long time that they were first cousins

During a family reunion in 2001, Frank Ybarra overheard some of Cliserio's other children talk about a half-sister they were hoping to meet.

Ybarra remembered that his wife had mentioned to him once that her co-worker was Cliserio's biological daughter, and so he took it upon himself to arrange a meeting between Villanueva and her half-siblings.

Last October, Lupe and her husband invited Frank and his wife to dinner. In the course of the evening, the two discovered they had a strong, inexplicable connection.

Shortly after, Lupe and Frank were contacted by one of Cliserio's other daughters who revealed to each of them that just before he died, the father said they were brother and sister.

In June, Lupe made up her mind to go under the knife to save her newfound brother's life. A blood test confirmed what they already knew – Frank and Lupe were a 99.99 per cent genetic match.

‘I don’t know how else to put it except for a miracle,’ Ybarra said. ‘She’s given me a second chance at life. You don’t pass [that] up.’
