Back in 2011 she was selling cars in Romford, but fast-forward four years and Gemma Collins has built a successful brand, launched a popular plus-size clothing range and starred on countless TV shows.

Keen to cash in on her success, the 34-year-old star of The Only Way Is Essex has unveiled more plus-size designs to keep up with customer demand.

Gemma has given FEMAIL a sneak peek of her spring collection and it's full of lovely lace dresses, feminine florals and the flattering cuts that have cemented her status as one of the nation's most esteemed plus-size designers.

The Only Way Is Essex star, Gemma Collins, has treated FEMAIL to a sneak peek of her spring collection and says it's 'a bit sexy but fun with some sophisticated pieces too; a bit like me really!' (dress: £70)

Speaking about her new range, she told us: 'It’s part of my spring collection, which is launching on my website throughout March and this is a little teaser for you. 

'I’m really excited for everyone to see the full range. I love feedback from my customers and this collection is definitely based on that. There’s some ruching, illusion panels and some pretty wow shapes that are magic at slimming and flattering.

Gemma's new plus-size collection is full of lovely lace dresses, feminine florals and the flattering cuts that have cemented her status as one of the nation's most esteemed plus-size designers - even being invited to stock her range in Evans (dress: £70)

Gemma says she designs everything with her customers in mind and has taken note of the catwalk's biggest trends and incorporated them into her new designs 

Gemma explains that she started the collection because she wanted to show curvy women out there how to embrace their curves. You know big IS beautiful,' she said. 

The TOWIE star has taken inspiration from the catwalks and is keen to show her fans that you don’t have to be size six to rock a fashion trend and to feel confident. 'Everyone needs a bit of Gemma Collins confidence baby!,' she laughed. 

Sharing her top tips for how women can flatter themselves come spring, Gemma, who cites Beth Ditto, Oprah Winfrey and Dawn French as her muses, said: 'Not all girls are brave enough to try something new and be a bit bold so this range is amazing for flattering girls so that they can be brave and experiment a bit more. 

'I get so many women messaging me thanking me because they tried something of mine that was out of their comfort zone and rocked it.'

The blonde star says she designs everything with her customers in mind and even takes the time to read through comments on her Twitter to see what changes women would like to see in her clothes. 

Clearly Gemma's hard work is paying off; her range is going to be stocked in 16 Evans stores nationwide, as well as on their website.

'It is surreal,' said Gemma of her latest gig. 

'When I found out I was so happy, it was my mum's birthday so we celebrated that night with a couple of glasses of bubbly. It means a lot that plus-size women out there still love my dresses and now it's being recognised by a company as big as Evans; amazing.'

It seems that this is only the beginning of a successful season for the star, whose psychic told her that summer is going to be a 'great time' for her. 

'I would also love to do a show about curvy women and fashion, I have some amazing ideas,' she said of future plans.

'I would love to give confidence to all plus-size women and get them looking fabulous; I could be the new Gok Wan, you know...just the blonder version. 

'I’m also really focussing on my healthy lifestyle as well, she added. 'I’ve been training, eating better and doing 3D Lipo as well. I’m never going to be a size 10 and I wouldn’t want to be. I wouldn’t want to get smaller than a size 16. It’s all about being happy and healthy for me - size is just a number.'

So where does she see herself in five years' time? 

'Sunning myself on a beach with a cocktail and surrounded by attractive tanned men. Where else babe?'.
