It is a compact version of the Galaxy S4 handset, which was launched in March, and the Mini has a 4.3-inch screen, an 8MP camera, a dual-core processor and weighs 107g.

The Galaxy S4 was launched in March and has already sold 10 million handsets, according to figures from Samsung. The S4 Mini is a compact version of the S4 with many of the same software features. Its hardware features are more like the Samsung Galaxy S3

The Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini will be available in Frost White, pictured, and Black Mist. Price and release dates are expected to be announced at an event in London in June

The optional S Health app can monitor calories, weight, real-time heart rate, sleeping patterns and can be used as pedometer.

It can be downloaded to the S4 Mini from the Samsung App store.

Samsung has made a habit of announcing new handsets and then releasing a
 Mini version a couple of months later - as seen with the Galaxy S2 and 
S2 Mini and the Galaxy S3 and S3 Mini.

The Mini versions are always cheaper, less powerful versions of their high-end predecessors.

The Galaxy S4 Mini will be available in two colours - White Frost and Black Mist.

There will be a 4G LTE, 3G and 3G Dual SIM version but information about which ones will be available in the UK, how much they will cost and when they will be released isn't due to be announced until the Samsung 2013 Premiere for Galaxy and Ativ in London on 20 June.

The built-in apps on the Galaxy S4 caused controversy earlier this month when it was discovered that buyers were getting much less storage than they paid for because the device is sold full of 'bloatware'.

Bloatware
 includes apps and files that are added to handsets by the manufacturers
 and networks before they are sold to customers.

The
 S4, which costs around Â£550 SIM-free, is advertised as having 16GB of 
internal storage, yet because or these preinstalled apps, operating 
system files and network features, this is almost halved to 8.8GB.
