Super-rich Premier League clubs are charging up to £600 for packages to allow youngsters to be mascots and walk out on to the pitch alongside their heroes.

The high costs have been condemned by fans and parent groups, who argue the policy excludes children from less well-off families.

The attempt by teams to cash in on the loyalty of young fans is just the latest evidence as to how Premier League teams are squeezing every penny from families.

For the clubs already charge extortionate prices for replica kit, while ticket prices and pay TV subscriptions are higher than in any other major football nation in Europe.

Eleven of the 20 teams in the Premier League charge a fee for being a mascot, rather than giving the opportunity away to deserving children in the community. The majority of the mascot packages include hospitality places at the designated match, a free kit, signed footballs, photos of the day, match tickets and other benefits.

The most expensive is at West Ham where it can be as much as £600 for the most attractive and high profile fixtures. Both Queens Park Rangers and Swansea City charge £450 plus VAT.

The packages can be £425 at Crystal Palace, £400 at Leicester and Spurs, £390 at Stoke, £300 at Burnley, £265 at West Brom and £150 at Hull.

At Newcastle United the corporate hospitality packages of £3,000-4,000 include mascot places.

Some of these clubs do soften the pain, including West Ham, Spurs, QPR and Newcastle, by offering a number of free mascot places during the season through competitions and charities.

However, others do not charge at all, including Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Southampton and Sunderland, according to the research by the Guardian.

Fans took to Twitter yesterday to condemn the high charges and praise those clubs who give the places free of charge to deserving youngsters. 

Rossco wrote: ‘So rich PL clubs charging children up to £600 to be a mascot for a day? I’m quickly falling out of love with what once was a beautiful game.’

Sunderland Stats said: ‘Well done Sunderland for not charging to be a mascot. Absolute disgrace that some clubs charge. West Ham £600!’

Richard Keys the former Sky sports football presenter described the tactic as ‘disgraceful’.

A blogger on the West Ham fansite Ironviews.com was also unhappy, describing the fees as ‘ridiculous’ and ‘unjustifiable’. A number of West Ham fans challenged the chairman, David Gold, to justify the fees.

One took a swipe at the West Ham fan, Russell Brand, who presents himself as a champion of the downtrodden, suggesting he should boycott the club for ‘this shameful exploitation of the proletariat’.

Clive Efford, the shadow minister for sport who is campaigning for fans to be represented on club boards, said: ‘I find it extraordinary that clubs which are getting so much money from TV rights then exclude kids from poorer backgrounds by imposing a fee.

‘It means that a certain class of kids will never be able to be a team’s mascot, and that doesn’t seem fair when their clubs are earning so much money. It seems ridiculous that some will be excluded because their parents can’t afford to put them on a waiting list.’

Kevin Miles, the chief executive of the Football Supporters’ Federation, described the charges as ‘extortionate’.

‘So many of the trappings around football, like junior replica kits and mascot opportunities are designed to win a place in the hearts of children for the football club. It then seems counter-intuitive to make those things themselves extortionately priced,’ he said.

The Premier League did not comment.

West Ham stressed it does offer some free spaces for child mascots in special cases.

A spokesman said: ‘We are committed to making football more affordable and offer a range of incentives to make it easier for young Hammers to attend our matches. This season we will be offering Kids for a Quid prices for six Premier League fixtures, where any number of Under-16s can attend when accompanied by an adult.’
