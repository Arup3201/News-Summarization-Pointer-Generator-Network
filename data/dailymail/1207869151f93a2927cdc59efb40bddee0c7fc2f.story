With their razor-sharp cheekbones, flawless skin and perfectly make-up, Cara Delevingne, Kendall Jenner and Gisele Bundchen are among the world's most genetically-blessed.

For those less fortunate in the looks department, a new app promises to give you supermodel features at the touch of a button.

YouCam Makeup lets its users virtually transform into their favourite model by tweaking their features to match the globe's most famous runway stars.

The app, which has been unveiled to tie in with New York Fashion Week, analysed the world's top models' make-up preferences and picked the looks deemed  trendiest for Spring.

FEMAIL put the app to the test and Olivia Foster transformed herself into Cara Delevingne, channelling the IT girl's statement brows, scarlet lips and signature smokey eyes.

Bianca London opted for a Kendall Jenner makeover and was given defined chocolate brown eyes and a more contoured look - but ended up looking more like an avatar than the in-demand model.

Users can also opt to be transformed into Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen and America's Next Top Model host, Tyra Banks.

Speaking about the app, a spokesperson said: 'NYC Fashion Week is expected to feature more fashion friendly technology than ever before this year, and YouCam Make-up perfectly illustrates how technology is transforming fashion and style.

'We can now experiment with an unlimited number of make-up looks in seconds - this is smart and empowering, the very essence of what fashion is all about.'

Downloaded more than eight million times since its launch last summer, YouCam Makeup harnesses the latest facial detection and skin analysis technology to apply realistic cosmetic looks on selfies and other photos. 

The app features a complete set of true-to-life make-up effects, including eye shadow palettes, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, blush and foundation.
