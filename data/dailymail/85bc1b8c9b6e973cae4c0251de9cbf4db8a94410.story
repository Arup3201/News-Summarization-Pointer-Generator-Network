After months of speculation and suspense, Netflix has finally announced it's launch date for Australia and New Zealand. 

On March 24 the streaming service will be available down under, with a whole of original new series set to debut on the Internet television provider.

'Many Aussies and Kiwis have heard a lot about Netflix over the years, and we’re excited they’ll get to experience our unique blend of Netflix original content, local series and films, and popular movies and TV shows from around the world, all for a low monthly price,' said Reed Hastings, Netflix co-founder and chief executive officer.

All three seasons of US political drama House of Cards will be available on the streaming service, as well as content from ABC, Roadshow Entertainment and Disney.

Netflix will be available on all major Australian broadband operators, but iiNet customers will get an especially sweet deal after the internet service provider signed an un-metering agreement.

This means users can stream an unlimited amount of content without it affecting their home data usage.

On Tuesday, in line with the launch date announcement, Netflix also debuted its Australian and New Zealand social media channels.

Netflix will be available on a range of devices from televisions and game consoles to tablets and smartphones.

Netflix has not announced monthly subscription prices, but told Daily Mail Australia they would be 'in line' with international prices.

Armed with just a backpack, light-up sneakers, and a couple of way-past-due library books, she’s ready to take on a world she didn’t even think existed anymore. Wide-eyed but resilient, nothing is going to stand in her way. She quickly finds a new job (working for 30 Rock's Jane Krakowski), a new roommate (Tituss Burgess, 30 Rock), and a new beginning,' Netflix said of the show. 

Rival streaming services Presto TV – from Foxtel and the Seven Network – and Stan – from Fairfax and Nine Entertainment – have also recently launched Down Under.

Globally, Netflix has almost 60 million subscribers after launching back in 1997 as little more than a DVD mail order company. 

The Australian and New Zealand launch announcement comes just days after it was revealed that within 24 hours of being pirated after its release on February 27, the third season of Netflix political drama House of Cards had been illegally downloaded nearly 700,000 times.

Among those who pirated the television series were 40,557 Australians, who ripped off the show more than any other nation, per capita.

Figures gathered by piracy tracker Excipio and reported by Variety revealed 681,889 unique browsers illegally downloaded the highly anticipated third season of House of Cards on the day after it was released

According to the overall statistics China had the most nationals obtain the season 3 illegally, with a figure of 60,538

Figures gathered by piracy tracker Excipio and reported by Variety revealed 681,889 unique browsers illegally downloaded the highly anticipated third season of House of Cards the day after it was released.

In February 2014, the second season of the Netflix series had 320,927 downloaders within 24 hours of being pirated.

According to the statistics, China had the most season 3 downloads, with 60,538, while the US - despite having access to the show on Netflix - was close behind with 50,008 people torrenting it.

India ranked third with 47,106 and Australia, which has a population far smaller than the other nations listed above it, was fourth with 40, 557.

Poland fifth with 37,552, with Britain (32,703), Canada (27,584), France (27,151), Greece (20,551) and the Netherlands (20,402) rounding out the top ten.

Just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as 'truly frightening' 

Piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones

Just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as 'truly frightening', as its revealed they could expose Australian internet users to unlimited damages payout to Hollywood studios.

Under the new Copyright Notice Scheme Industry Code, anyone with an internet connection could potentially face legal threats from Hollywood studios for illegally downloading movies, TV shows, and music.

Consumer group Choice labelled the plan, which was compiled by Australia's largest internet service providers (ISP's) at the request of the federal government, as 'medieval' and said it 'reads like a horror movie script'.

The scheme could come into affect as soon as September this year.

Under the proposed code, a three-strikes system would be introduced for illegal downloads.

Customers suspected of illegally downloading content will be sent a series of notices from their ISP's - a warning, an 'education' notice, and a final notice.

'The code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action. Often consumers share with flatmates, partners, or family, which means that even those who don't download illegally could be taken to court,' Ms Turner told Daily Mail Australia.

Foxtel has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups

55% of Australians who downloaded content illegally, including Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul (above)  said it was because of a lack of access

The Communications Alliance, the industry body backing the proposed code, released a statement last week emphasising the 'public education' elements of the code, but noted that the scheme did provide a process of 'facilitated preliminary discovery'. 

In Australia, piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones.  

Unlike in New Zealand, Australia has no limit to fines under the Copyright Act, and it is up to the judge's discretion as to what the consumer is fined.  

Choice has been vocal about providing consumers with a greater range of legal options to download the content they are seeking so that they don't resort to illegal content.

'We did a survey last year which found that a third of Australians download illegally, and more watch the illegal content,' said Ms Turner.

'When we asked people the reason they downloaded, 55% said it was because of a lack of access, and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources,' she said.

Ms Turner said that 55% of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources

'Consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online, but that they are blocked from accessing it. It makes very little sense to them.'   

The code indicates that rights holders need to be working towards initiatives which 'include continuing efforts of Rights Holders to ensure timely and ready availability to Australian consumers of lawful content alternatives.'

However, Ms Turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as Stan available in Australia, the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed.

Choice is calling on Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code, and have launched a campaign urging him to take responsibility for the internet policy.
