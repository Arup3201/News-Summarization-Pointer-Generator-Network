The Premier League has had its share of renowned dead-ball specialists down the years, with the likes of David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Leighton Baines among them.

However, none of them make the top three most clinical players of the last 14 years when it comes to scoring direct from free-kicks.

Instead, top of the pile is Manchester United's Juan Mata who, based on official Premier League data, has been the deadliest set-piece exponent during that period.

Juan Mata is the Premier League's most deadly free-kick taker of all-time

The Spaniard scores from a set-piece for Manchester United against Southampton last year

The Spain international has scored five of his 28 attempts, giving him a conversion rate of 17.9 per cent - almost three times the success rate of Everton ace Baines, who is ninth on our list with 6.6 per cent (five goals from 76 shots).

Second on the list - compiled from players who have scored five or more free-kicks since the start of the 2001-02 season - is Sunderland's Sebastian Larsson, who showed his prowess with a brilliant set-piece strike against Tottenham at the weekend.

That was the 11th time the Sweden international has scored direct from 90 free-kick attempts in the Premier League, giving him a conversion rate of 12.2 per cent.

At that current rate, the final tally is set to be around 26 at the end of the campaign - well down on the 39 scored last season when Yaya Toure, Mata and Baines were especially deadly, and a figure which would represent the second lowest in the 13-and-a-half-seasons since official records began in 2001/02.

The highest number of free-kick goals scored in the last 14 years goes to former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry with 12 (8.3 per cent), but it must be noted that he, along with the likes of third-placed Beckham (five goals at 9.3 per cent), were also playing top-flight football before the 2001-02 season.

Manchester City's Yaya Toure hasn't been able to match his impressive free-kick success rate of last season 

So far 246 shots direct from free-kicks have been attempted in the Premier League this season, an average of 1.12 per match. That is by far the lowest amount, with the highest coming in the 2008-09 season when the average per game was 1.72, with 31 goals scored during the campaign from 652 tries.

Perhaps it is no coincidence that season was also Cristiano Ronaldo's final one in England.

The former Manchester United man is famed for his dead-ball prowess and willingness to try his luck from most ranges and angles, and it should be no surprise to see him near the top of the list for free-kick attempts in the Premier League since the start of the 2001-02 campaign.

Sebastian Larsson scores from a free-kick against Tottenham - his 11th goal from 90 set piece attempts

David Beckham, known for his fantastic free-kicks, finish in fourth place with a 9.3 per cent conversion rate

The current Real Madrid star and reigning Ballon d'Or winner had 164 shots from free-kicks in top-flight matches and scored 10 during his time at United, for a conversion rate of 6.1 per cent.

That ranks him the 11th most clinical player on our list,

Larsson, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (six goals at 9.7 per cent), David Beckham (five goals at 9.3 per cent) and Nolberto Solano (seven goals at 9.0 per cent) complete the top five.

Frank Lampard had the most attempts of players who had scored five or more free-kicks, with the midfielder trying his luck 175 times for seven goals (4.0 per cent).

Cristiano Ronaldo had 164 shots from free-kicks in top-flight matches and scored 10 during his time at United

Former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is third on the most deadly set-piece takers list

Thierry Henry scored the most direct free-kicks with 12 - his conversion rate was 8.3 per cent
