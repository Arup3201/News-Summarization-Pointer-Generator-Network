A British rapper who joined rebels fighting the Syrian regime has launched a rant against anti-terror police after his family home was raided.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, tweeted to say that 'kuffar mi5' had kicked his family out of their £1million home in Maida Vale, west London, while officers carried out a search.

Bary, who used to be an aspiring rapper and had his music featured on BBC Radio 1, walked out of his parents' house last year to join rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

He tweeted: 'These kuffar mi5 have removed ma mum and fam from house and raided mum's house.

'Hip-hop jihadist': Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, walked out of his family's £1million home in Maida Vale, west London, last year to join militant groups, telling them he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah'

Bary launched a twitter rant against anti-terror police who raided his family home in west London calling them 'kuffar' (non-believers) and pagans

'They have nothing to do with this, they did not even know where I am. I haven't lived at home for years you pagans.'

Bary, who goes by the name Abu Klashnikov [sic] on Twitter, has since had his account suspended.

A police spokesman said: 'Officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, with support from the Met Police, searched a property in Maida Vale in connection to an on-going, Syria-related investigation.

'No arrests were made and inquiries are continuing.'

Earlier this year Bary claimed he was kidnapped, tortured and robbed by members of rival Islamic terror groups.

Posting under the name 'Terrorist', he said: 'Me & Abu Hussein al britani got kidnapped /tortured by FSA/IF scum they stole our 4 ak's and a 7mm, my vechile & our phones and cash.'

Friends said Bary - an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene - grew increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary.

He has posted a series of photographs online, including shots of him masked and posing with guns under the title 'soldier of Allah'.

In other messages he called on Allah to 'grant us martyrdom', and praised Osama Bin Laden. Bary, whose music has featured on Radio 1, is one of six children of Adel Abdul Bary, 53.

Bary used to write music under the name L Jinny or Lyricist Jinny and had his songs featured on BBC Radio 1 before deciding to give up his promising career to become a rebel fighter in Syria

Bary walked out of the family home last year in order to join rebels fighting in Syria. Since then he has been tweeting under the names 'Terrorist' and 'Abu Klasnikov' though his account in now suspended

Bary's father Adel Abdel was extradited from Britain to the US in 2011 after an eight-year legal battle that made him a cause celebre of the Left as lawyers took his publicly funded case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

Investigators believe he was one of Bin Laden's closest lieutenants in the infancy of Al Qaeda and ran a London cell of the terror network.

He faces life in prison if convicted of involvement in the bombings of US embassies in East Africa in 1998.

His son's appearance among the ranks of UK jihadists in Syria, where several Britons fighting for the militants have already been killed, will add to concerns about their potential threat to the West.

Bary lived with his mother Ragaa for more than a decade in a home in Maida Vale, owned by Westminster Council. If it were sold on the open market it would be worth £1million.

She travelled to Britain from Egypt in 1990 after her husband was granted refugee status.

Friends said Bary's conversion to radical Islam happened as he grew increasingly frustrated with the British authorities over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

And it came despite his fledgling success on the underground grime music scene, where he rapped under the names Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny Bary appeared in dozens of videos, including one in which he posed outside the Bank of England and declared his allegiance to the global hacking group Anonymous.

On July 1 last year, he announced that he was turning his back on music as 'I have left everything for the sake of Allah'.

It is understood that soon afterwards he travelled to Syria, where one of his oldest friends had already joined the fighting.

He changed his Twitter name to Soldier of Allah and posed for pictures wearing a mask and military fatigues while carrying an AK-47 and other large assault rifles.

Last November he said, 'Oh Allah, grant us martyrdom' and praised Bin Laden, calling him a 'lion'. Referring to conditions in Syria, he said it is the 'real jungle out here'.
