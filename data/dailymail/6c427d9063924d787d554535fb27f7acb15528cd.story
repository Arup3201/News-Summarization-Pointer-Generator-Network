Team GB Ambassador Prince Harry cracked a string of Olympic jokes at a reception yesterday – ribbing Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt about his bell clanging disaster, the scandal of empty seats at Olympic venues and even the drugs furore surrounding teenage Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen.

Echoing the antics of his notoriously gaffe-prone grandfather, Prince Phillip, the third in line to the throne entertained a group of young sports hopefuls in the gardens of Clarence House with a host of asides about the London Games.

Top of his list was Mr Hunt who was left cringing after the prince reminded him about his by now infamous TV blunder when a bell he was ringing at an event to celebrate the opening of the Olympics flew off its handle – and narrowly avoided hitting a group of women.

Speaking to a group of 25 young athletes who won medals in the first School Games, which took place at the Olympic Park in May,

Harry
said: ‘Hopefully one of these great legacies of London 2012 will be 
that the Olympic athletes from this country and around the world will 
inspire future generations to take up sport. Every one of you here today
are now the leaders of that legacy whether you like it or not...

‘I
urge you to pick up the torch, or in Jeremy's case, the bell, and I 
expect to see your faces again when you stand on the podium at Rio and 
beyond.’

The crowd roared at the politician’s obvious embarrassment, but Mr Hunt appeared to take the teasing with good grace.

Harry
had another dig again later when he told a group of young athletes: ‘I 
hope you've all got tickets to watch your events’ before gesturing at 
Jeremy Hunt and adding: ‘If not, this is your man.’

The School Games is a year-round 
school sports initiative which uses the inspiration of London’s Olympics
and Paralympics to transform competitive sport in schools and get more 
people playing sport.

Thousands
of schools across the country have signed up to take part in local 
class versus class and school versus school competitions, along with 
county wide sports festivals

The first School Games finals saw 
1,600 elite young athletes compete in four Olympic venues: the Olympic 
Stadium, the Aquatic Centre, the Velodrome and the ExCeL Centre.

Prince
Harry is President of the School Games and is using his support to 
highlight the role that competitive sport can play in the development of
young people.

Harry, 
who was also joined by Olympics Gold medallists Jason Gardener and 
Darren Campbell, as well as current Olympian weightlifter Zoe Smith, was
relaxed and chatty as he circulated among the young people aged 13 to 
16 and their families.

Harry
told a group of children: ‘We saw what that Chinese girl did, she 
knocked five seconds off her time - apparently teenagers can do that.’ Pointing at 16-year-old Jermaine Hamilton he said: ‘If they can you'll be running in seven seconds.’

The
teenager, who attends Rushcroft Sports College in Chingford, Essex won 
two gold medals in the School Games - one for the 200m and one for the 
4x100m relay.

Harry urged the youngsters to emulate the success of 16-year-old Chinese swimming sensation Shiwen Ye

He said: ‘It was a good experience to meet Prince Harry.

‘He said good luck to me and he's looking forward to seeing me in 2016.’

Harry went on to tell the assembled guests: ‘Hopefully you’ll grow and grow and grow to be very famous and then we can beat China.’

Jason Gardener, who won a gold in the 4 x 100m relay in Athens, added: ‘It's amazing to be here to hopefully inspire the next generation.

‘To meet some of the young athletes is amazing, some of these will go onto fly the flag for our country. This is our future.

‘It's special to have Prince Harry involved. It shows how important sport is to this country to have someone like him.

‘He seems to have a connection with these young people and he's in touch.‘I asked him who he thinks will win the 100 metres. I think his money's on Bolt.’

Asked by the current Games he added: ‘The rowing yesterday was fantastic, it's always a special achievement being the first Brit to achieve a gold, especially in these circumstances where we expect it to come from elsewhere.

‘We can be a nation of moaners. We usually moan about the weather.‘But I think it's right the public want to see your first gold.

‘We've been talking up this games and our heroes for so long and rightfully so we expect to see gold medals and medals won by Britain, that's how we're going to inspire the next generation of champions.

‘But at the same time it just goes to show that these medals are not easy, people all round the world are prepared and work just as hard as our athletes so the margins are so close.’
