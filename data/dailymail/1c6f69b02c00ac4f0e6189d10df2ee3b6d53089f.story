A South Korean fisherman kidnapped by North Korea 41 years ago has managed to pull off a daring escape and has been reunited with his family in Seoul.

No details of how Jeon Wook-pyo, now 68, managed to escape from the secretive North but most who have made it across the border - either by land or across a river into China - risk being shot by guards.

It was in 1972 when Jeon was serving as one of 25 crewmen manning two South Korean boats that they were all captured by North Korean sailors in the Yellow Sea.

A spokesman for the Abductees' Family Union, based in Seoul, said Jeon managed to flee from the North early last month.

'He is the only crewman from those two boats to have escaped,' said the spokesman, Choi Sung-yung.

On his arrival in Seoul, Jeon was taken to a safe house by South Korean security officials and questioned about his life in the enemy North - what is expected to be the first of a series of debriefings.

A black and white photograph released earlier this month by Choi Sung-yong shows a 1974 photo of 36 South Korean fishermen grouped together on North Korea's Mount Myohyang, among them Jeon Wook-pyo, whose name was also spelt as Chun.

Revealing his escape from the 
security of a 'safe country' - believed to be China - after he had 
crossed over the border, Jeon wrote to South Korea's President Park 
Geun-hye asking for help.

He
told her he had risked his life to escape because he missed his family 
and friends in the South more and more and wished to spent his remaining
years with them and be buried there.

It
is believed that Seoul's security officials will want to firmly 
establish that Jeon has not been indoctrinated with the mind-set of the 
Stalinist North and will take every opportunity to spy on the South.

They
would also want to ensure that the escaped man really was Jeon - and 
not an elderly North Korean intelligence agent using his identity.

People who have escaped from the North in the past have claimed that a large number of spies are operating in South Korea, some having been 'allowed' to escape in order to carry out their intelligence work.

Seoul officials estimate that at least 3,800 South Koreans have been kidnapped by North Korea since the Korean War of 1950-53.

The main purpose was to question them about the way of life in the South so that North Korean spies could easily infiltrate cities when on undercover missions.

Mr Kim Hyung-suk, spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry confirmed today that Jeon had safely returned to the South, but gave no other details about his escape.

Mr Choi, whose own father, a seaman, was kidnapped by North Korea in 1967 - never to return - says his family union group has managed to smuggle at least seven South Koreans back to their country via China.
