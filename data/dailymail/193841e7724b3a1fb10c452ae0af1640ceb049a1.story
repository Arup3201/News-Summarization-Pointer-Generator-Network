Ready to rock: Liam Gallagher after his band Beady Eye's gig in Ibiza on Wednesday. He has been told not to come home by his wife - for now...

Liam Gallagher’s furious wife has banned him from home following allegations he fathered a love child, it was claimed yesterday.

All Saints singer Nicole Appleton is said to be livid at reports her rock star husband has a secret baby with a New York Times journalist.

A friend said: ‘Nicole has told Liam not to come home, at least not for a few weeks, and is furious.’

There was no sign of Miss Appleton, 38, at the couple’s £2.7million five-bedroom townhouse in Hampstead, North London yesterday.

Gallagher, 40, is in Spain, where he appeared unfazed as he downed cocktails. He was being comforted by a mystery brunette in a black bikini, who stroked his head as they lay beside a hotel pool in Ibiza.

Starting at 11.30am, the former Oasis frontman drank more than a dozen mojitos and several tequila shots as he laughed and joked with friends.

The previous night his new band Beady Eye had performed at the Ibiza Rocks festival.

Afterwards he was said to have looked ‘happy and relaxed’ as he mingled with female fans and posed for photographs at Pikes Hotel, a favourite celebrity haunt in San Antonio, and danced topless on his room balcony, which overlooks the bar, until 2.30am.

Gallagher, who will fly to Alicante today to play at the Benicassim festival, has made no public comment on what his spokesman says is ‘gossip’.

The seven-month-old girl, Emma, was born in January to blonde showbusiness writer Liza Ghorbani following a long-running affair, according to the New York Post.

Last year Gallagher bought a £1.6million apartment in New York, close to Central Park and not far from where Emma is being raised.

Gallagher has ‘admitted she is a beautiful child because she has “rock star genes”’, the New York Post claimed.

It alleged Gallagher’s relationship with Miss Ghorbani ended only after Emma was born.

Their trysts began after the music journalist met the former Oasis frontman in 2010 and wrote a glowing interview for the New York Times, entitled A Night Out With Liam Gallagher.

The simpering article recounted how the British singer ‘turned heads’ at the Ritz-Carlton hotel bar and ‘sauntered’ down Central Park West looking like ‘he’d just stepped off Carnaby Street in London circa 1969’.

Unmarried Miss Ghorbani, 39, has told friends their affair ended and then resumed again, according to another newspaper, the New York Daily News.

It quoted a friend as saying: ‘It went on until she told him she was pregnant. He cut it off. He was so paranoid his wife would find out.’

'Livid': Miss Appleton, left, and Gallagher have a 12-year-old son. They were married in 2008. It has been claimed his affair with Miss Ghorbani began after she profiled him for the New York Times

Gallagher has taken steps to prevent the story spreading, instructing London law firm Harbottle & Lewis to write warning letters to newspapers making inquiries about the singer’s reaction to the claims.

He is also reported to have hired a lawyer in New York to defend himself against a paternity suit brought by Miss Ghorbani at the Manhattan Family Court.

She is  alleged to be seeking £2million. After paying for the medical costs of the birth herself, Miss Ghorbani began the legal action and arranged a DNA test for her baby.

Gallagher’s lawyers are taking unspecified ‘action’ against the New York Post for naming him as the father, but yesterday it made further claims.

A source told the newspaper: ‘Liza met Liam when she interviewed him and they began an affair [which] continued until around three months after the birth of the child. He ended the relationship when she told him she was suing him for child support.

‘Liza isn’t after millions of dollars, she is simply seeking child support and no amount has yet been set. If they don’t settle on a figure, the case will go to a public trial.’

Miss Ghorbani, who specialises in interviewing rock stars, was not at her Manhattan apartment yesterday. She was said to be staying with her parents at their £500,000 house in McLean, Virginia.

Her mother Sylvia, 63 – who was born in Lancashire and moved to America aged 19 – declined to comment.

She is a teacher at a local school, while her husband, Iranian-born Daryoush, 65, runs his own mobile home business.

Friends claim that Gallagher left it to another family member to break the news of the love child allegations to his mother.

A source said: ‘They thought Liam should have done it himself.

‘His family have also advised Liam to see a top lawyer for the court case – and to consult a top divorce lawyer as well.

‘They are concerned for Liam. They say he’s “chaos” and that they are worried that he won’t stop his partying lifestyle until he makes himself ill.’

Friends of Canadian-born Miss Appleton say she never suspected her husband would be unfaithful despite wide-spread reports of him cheating on his first wife.

Gallagher married his first wife, actress Patsy Kensit, in 1997. But only a couple of months later he fathered a child with singer Lisa Moorish.

Their daughter Molly is now 15. Gallagher and Miss Kensit had a son, Lennon, now 13, in 1999. In 2001, Gallagher had another son, Gene, now 12, with Miss Appleton, whom he married in 2008.

In the same year, Gallagher boasted he was a ‘top dad’ who had turned his back on a rock’n’roll lifestyle to be there for his family.

The singer revealed he had never intended to become a father but insisted: ‘Once you get your missus pregnant, you’ve got to step up to the plate.’
