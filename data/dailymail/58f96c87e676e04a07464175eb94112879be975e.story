With West Ham enjoying their best start to a season since 1983-84, Sam Allardyce celebrated by enjoying a well-earned break on the sunny island of Mauritius.

With the Hammers sitting pretty at fourth in the Premier League table, October’s Manager of the Month was seen sporting bright red trunks and shades as he strolled up and down the beach enjoying the temperatures.

Although the international break is the perfect opportunity to top up on some tanning, Hammers’ fans will hope Big Sam has one eye on his new-look West Ham’s clash with Everton on Saturday.

With Swansea and Arsenal hot on their tail, the Upton Park outfit will travel to Goodison Park looking for a sixth win of the season, a tough task as they face an Everton side beginning to find the form they showed last term as they climb up the table.

Although there will be a stark contrast from the 250C heat in Mauritius to the bleaker conditions on Merseyside at 3pm on Saturday, you can be sure Allardyce won’t mind if his side walks away with three points.
