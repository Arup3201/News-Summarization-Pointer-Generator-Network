If your Instagram photos aren’t getting as much attention as you’d like, it may be down to the filters you’re using and even the colour of the object your photographing.

Analytics firm Curalate studied millions of Instagram photos to determine which shots proved the most popular on the photo-sharing app.

The research found blue-tinted images received 24 per cent more likes than images where the predominant colour was red or orange.

Philadelphia-based analytics firm Curalate analysed 8 million Instagram photos to see which were most popular. It studied each image for 30 different features including different colours, saturation levels, texture, brightness and more. Predominantly blue images were more popular than red or orange shots, by around 24%

Based on the research from Curalate, to get the most likes for an Instagram photo make sure the predominant colour is blue, and avoid reds and oranges.

Make sure the blue colour takes up more than 20 per cent of screen.

Leave enough background space, and don't crop in images too closely.

Use filters such as Walden and Rise to lower the saturation levels and make sure a flash is used, or the image contains a large of amount of light.

Finally, if you want people to share the image on Twitter, upload the Instagram photo via the Twitter app and don't click Share directly from Instagram.

Equally, posts with a high proportion of background space attracted 29 per cent more likes than images that were closely cropped.

The Philadelphia-based firm tested 8 million Instagram posts for 30 different features.

These included different colours, saturation, how much of an image was dominated by a particular hue, texture, brightness and more.

As well as checking for the popularity of certain colours, Curalate discovered photos in which one colour in particular dominated the image gained 40 per cent more likes that multi-coloured images.

This maybe because one-colour images are rare – Curalate found 90 per cent of the images analysed failed to have dominant colours.

Lighter photos were more popular than 
darker photos, by 24 per cent, and highly textured photos got more 
attention than flatter snaps, by almost 80 per cent.

In
particular, images with lightness levels measured by Curalate to be 
between 65 and 80 per cent got almost 25 per cent more likes than images
with 0 to 45 per cent lightness.

This photo would attract a high number of likes because the predominant colour is blue and the blue colour covers more than 20 per cent of the screen, according to Curalate. However, it is dark meaning it wouldn't get as many likes than if it was colourful and the blue is vibrant, while Instagram users prefer duller colours

As well as checking for the popularity of certain colours, Curalate discovered photos in which one colour in particular dominated the image, such as the green grass in this picture, gained 40 per cent more likes than multi-coloured images - regardless of the colour

The saturation levels in a photo also influenced its popularity, and this was predominantly down to the filter that was used.

Instagram offers 20 different filters and some, including Walden and Rise, drain the colour from photos deliberately.

Images with low saturation received 18 per cent more likes than more vibrant shots taken through filters such as Hefe and Kelvin.

A recent study additionally found that photos can boost the number of retweets a post gets on Twitter.

The research by Dan Zarrella,
HubSpot's social-media scientist, discovered tweets including 
photos, and in particular photos hosted by Twitter's own picture 
service, are 94 per cent more likely to be shared.

At the other end of the scale, tweets that include links to Instagram pictures are 42 per cent less likely to be retweeted. Zarella studied 400,000 randomly selected tweets and compared their retweet rates.
