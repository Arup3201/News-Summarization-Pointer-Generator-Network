It might have only just turned Spring, but Summer appears to be on its way already - as temperatures are set to soar to a staggering 21C.

Britain is preparing to bask in glorious sunshine as the weather takes a turn for the better - with Sunday forecast to be the hottest day of the year so far.

The warm, sunny weather means the country will be hotter than the likes of various holiday destinations, including Spain, Greece and even Morocco.

Having fun: Astonishingly, temperatures will be higher than those in Spain, Greece and even Morocco. Left, a packed beach and, right, a woman is overcome by waves

Making the most of the weather: Surfers emerge from the sea carrying their boards in Brighton today as warm weather and high temperatures sweep the country

Relaxing: A man sunbathes on Brighton seafront as temperatures soar to 19C. They are expected to reach 21C tomorrow - making it the hottest day of the year so far

But forecasters have warned the hot 
temperatures will be dampened by showery rain, clouds and a cool breeze -
 particularly in the North East and South West of England.

The warm spell is driven by hot air from the Continent heading north and is predicted to last most of  the week.

Meteorologist
 Emma Corrigan, of The Met Office, said: 'Most areas of the country 
will see hazy sunshine and temperatures of up to 19C developing 
throughout the day, with showery rain here and there across the South 
West of England.

'On
 Sunday, Britain could potentially see temperatures of 20 or maybe even 
21 degrees celsius. This is particularly likely in London and the 
Midlands.

'This year's 
highest temperature of 20.5C was recorded in Gravesend, Kent, on March 
9. So there is definitely potential for tomorrow to become the hottest 
day of the year so far.'

Bliss: However, forecasters have warned the hot temperatures will be dampened by showery rain, clouds and a cool breeze. Above, people relax on Brighton pier

Sunny: Meteorologist Emma Corrigan, of The Met Office, said: 'Most areas of the UK will see hazy sunshine and temperatures of up to 19C developing through the day'

Crowded seafront: She added: 'On Sunday, Britain could potentially see temperatures of 20 or maybe even 21C. This is particularly likely in London and the Midlands'

Looking happy: Ms Corrigan said there is 'definitely potential for tomorrow to become the hottest day of the year so far.' Above, a young girl collects pebbles on her spade

Joyful: Brand manager Tara Viesnik (left) plays with her dog Nerone in Regent's Park, London, while Roan Leishman (right), seven, has fun on Great Yarmouth beach

Colourful: The North East of England and areas of Scotland are forecast to be 'a bit cooler with clouds and patchy drizzle'. Above, a woman sits in Regent's Park, London

She added: 'But the North East of 
England and areas of East Scotland - especially along the coast - will 
be a bit cooler with clouds and patchy drizzle.'

If
 they meet expectations, the warm temperatures will beat the likes of 
Spain, which is forecast to see temperatures around the 16/17C mark, and
 Greece, which is predicted to drop as low as 15C tomorrow.

They
 will even be higher than Morocco, which is forecast to see highs of 
just 16C today. However, temperatures in the North African country are 
set to soar to a warmer - albeit, still cooler than Britain - 20C on 
Sunday.

Punting: People enjoy the warm weather and unseasonably high temperatures while punting on the River Cambridge amid brightly-coloured daffodils this afternoon

Day out: The country has been basking in glorious sunshine today as the weather took a turn for the better. Above, members of the public punt on the River Cambrdige

Incredible: Tomorrow is forecast to be the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures of up to 21C. Above, a cool and misty sunrise is pictured at Herne Bay in Kent

Spectacular: The sun rises at a low tide in Herne Bay, a popular seaside town that is seven miles north of Canterbury and five miles east of Whitstable

Amazing views: This year's highest temperature of 20.5C was recorded in Gravesend, Kent, on March 9. Above, a man looks out at sea in Kent under a sun-lit morning sky

Sunrise: Forecasters warn the hot weather will be dampened by showery rain, clouds and a breeze. Above, the sun rises on Upton Dyke in the Norfolk Broads today

Beautiful: Meteorologist Emma Corrigan, of The Met Office, said most of the UK would see 'hazy sunshine' and temperatures of up to 19C developing through the day

Burning away: She added: 'On Sunday, Britain could potentially see temperatures of 20 or maybe even 21C. This is particularly likely in London and the Midlands'

Dozens of sun-seekers flocked to Brighton seafront yesterday to make the most of the summery weather, before engaging in leisurely sessions of sunbathing, surfing and swimming.

Others were greeted by colourful arrays of daffodils in Regent's Park, London, while some took the opportunity to go punting on the River Cam.

Meanwhile, a pale yellow sun was captured 
burning away mist on Upton Dyke in the Norfolk Broads this morning -  
just 24 hours after freezing temperatures were reported in Devon, with 
up to three inches of snow blanketing houses, cars and the ground.

Taking a stroll: If they meet expectations, the warm temperatures will beat the likes of Spain, which is forecast to see temperatures around the 16/17C mark, and Greece, which is predicted to drop as low as 15C tomorrow. Above, a man walks in the sun-lit mist on Upton Dyke

Morning sun: They will even be higher than Morocco, which is forecast to see highs of just 16C today. Ms Corrigan said Sunday could be the hottest day of the year so far

Joyful: However, temperatures in the Morocco are set to soar to a warmer 20C on Sunday.  Above, Georgia Marriott, 10, wanders through a field of daffodils in Spalding

In bloom: Georgia crouches down to admire the daffodils as the weather takes a turn for the better in the Lincolnshire market town. The daffodils are already in flower

Hard at work: Several workers pick daffodils in Spalding this morning as temperatures soar to 19C. They are expected to rise even further to a staggering 21C tomorrow

The
 unseasonably warm temperatures are also a stark contrast to March 2013,
 which was revealed as the second coldest on record following weeks of 
icy conditions, heavy snows and cold temperatures.

This year's higher temperatures have tricked some of our most beautiful flowers and trees into blossoming early.

Most plants stop growing when day and night time temperatures fall below 6C (43F) or 4C (39F).

Despite
 the devastating floods up until last month, the average temperature was
 5.2C (41.4F) throughout winter across Britain – making it the fifth 
warmest winter since records began in 1910. Because the soil is far 
warmer than usual, plants have begun their spring growth early.

Stark contrast: The forecast comes just a day after freezing conditions were reported in Devon. Above, snow falls in Princetown in Dartmoor, Devon, yesterday morning

Summer bluebells, which normally form 
carpets of blue in May, are already flowering, while gardens are now 
full of colour from blooming tulips, peach blossom, blackthorn and the 
May tree – which usually only erupts into white flowers in time for May 
Day.

The Woodland Trust, which collects sightings of blossom each year for its Nature’s Calendar project, has already had 14 reports of bluebells in Berkeley, Gloucestershire; Colchester in Essex and as far north as Hexham, Northumberland.

Dr Kate Lewthwaite, project manager of the Woodland Trust’s Nature’s Calendar, said yesterday: ‘Spring is well and truly on its way.’
