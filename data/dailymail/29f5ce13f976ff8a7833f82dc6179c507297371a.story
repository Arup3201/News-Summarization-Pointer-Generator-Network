A ninth-grade student at a North Carolina high school has died less than 24 hours after being diagnosed with a rare, but deadly bacterial infection.

Officials at East Chapel Hill High School have said they believe the unnamed 14-year-old boy died on Wednesday from Meningococcal disease.

It is a bacterial infection that is caused by the same bacteria that can cause Meningitis and blood infections.

Concerned parents have received a letter from school officials that the boy may have been infectious on Feb. 11, 12, 17 and 18.

‘If a person is infected, symptoms usually start within three to four days of exposure but can take as long as 14 days to begin,’ the school said.

The boy presented the first symptoms on Tuesday, said the Orange County Health Department.

‘It’s not airborne. It doesn’t live for a long time on door knobs and other hard surfaces,’ Orange County Health Director Dr. Colleen Bridger told WTVD.

A dark purple rash may appear in the later stages of Meningococcal disease

Signs and symptoms of meningococcal include:

If infected, symptoms usually start within three to four days of exposure but can take as long as 14 days to begin

‘Kissing somebody, drinking after 
somebody, smoking the same cigarette as somebody, those types of things 
are what we worry about when we think about transmission.’

The student is thought to have died from a blood infection known as meningococcal septicemia.

Signs of meningococcal septicemia include fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, chills and muscle aches, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A dark purple rash may appear in the later stages of the infection. Signs of meningitis include fever, headache and stiff neck.

The Center for Disease Control recommends that all 11- and 12-year-olds be vaccinated against meningococcal disease. It’s unclear whether the student received the vaccine.

The Orange County Health Department has advised people who were in close contact with that student to take antibiotics to prevent the infection.

The school said the spread of meningococcal disease in a classroom setting is rare.
