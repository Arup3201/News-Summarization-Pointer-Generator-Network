It was supposed to make NSW Premier Mike Baird appear more hip and appealing to a younger generation in the lead up to state elections next month.

But the Liberal leader earned an Internet fail on Friday when the video posted online of him reading out nasty tweets about himself - imitating US comedian Jimmy Kimmel's popular TV spot 'Mean Tweets' - was pulled for trampling copyright restrictions.

Mr Baird's use of  music by Taylor Swift and R.E.M without permission are believed to be behind the video take-down.

New South Wales Premier Mike Baird shared a video of himself reading online hate mail he received 

The video was inspired by the American television host Jimmy Kimmel's popular segment Mean Tweets, in which celebrities share the cruel messages they've received on Twitter

In Kimmel's TV segment, celebrities share the cruel messages they've received on Twitter.

In Mr Baird's version, the comments he shared included: 'You look like the 'smiling assassin'. Your charming smile hides your black Liberal heart.'

Mr Baird had ended his video with a reference to singers Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift.

Responding to a Tweet he received that read: 'Mike Baird just announced he hates Justin Bieber', Mr Baird said: 'Yes, of course I hate Justin Bieber, who doesn't hate Justin Bieber, what's wrong with that?'

He then added: 'But my daughters are Taylor Swift fans and they tell me, when you get this sort of stuff, shake it off!'

R.E.M's 'Everybody Hurts', which had been used as background music during the video, was then abruptly replaced by Swift's Shake It Off while the Premier was filmed laughing.

But less than 24 hours after the video was uploaded on Thursday, the premier's shot at viral fame backfired when YouTube administrators removed it for infringing copyright.

Upon removing the video, YouTube explained that it would no longer be available due to a copyright claim by Warner Chappell, who owns the rights to both songs, Junkee reports.

'Mean tweets video removed. Working with YouTube and Warner to resolve. Fact: everybody hurts, sometimes,' Mr Baird Tweeted on Friday morning.

The other hateful Tweets shared by Mr Baird included: 'Mike Baird, I knew you were in Newcastle yesterday coz I could smell the stench of sulphur from your pitch fork form over 10 miles away' and 'I bet when you get home, your wife won't even kiss that filthy, lying mouth of yours'.

To the latter tweet, the Premier replied: 'bad luck Damo Williams, my wife still kisses me'.
