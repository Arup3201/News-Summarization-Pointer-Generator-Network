Their combined worth is more than £165 million but that doesn't mean that David and Victoria Beckham will be spending more than they need to this Christmas. 

The thrifty couple have reportedly turned their backs on extravagant Xmas dining, choosing instead to enjoy the £7.99 festive meal in Wetherspoon pub The Half Moon in Stepney, east London.

And for an extra £2.95, slim Victoria could be digging into the 430-calorie chicken liver and Ayrshire bacon pate starter whilst David could opt for the British broccoli and Shropshire blue cheese soup.

The £7.99 Christmas meal includes a drink but starters and dessert cost an additional £2.25

According to the Sun, Golden Balls and Posh Spice will be taking their four children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper to the east London boozer for a slap up meal of turkey and all the trimmings. 

But if Victoria wants to keep her meal light, she can always opt for the 1,224-calorie salmon fillet main, instead of the traditional roast bird, a whopping 1,673 calories.

The family were reported to have been invited by the ex-footballer's older sister Lynne and her partner Kevin Briggs, who is believed to have planned the cheap-as-chips traditional meal

The traditional roast dinner with all the trimmings is a whopping 1,673 calories

The paper reported that the couple were invited by the ex-footballer's older sister Lynne and her partner Kevin Briggs, who is believed to have planned the cheap-as-chips traditional meal.  

'Spoons xmas meal in a few weeks. Let us know if you're in. We'll do a fiver [£5] max secret santa,' he said in a text to all of their relatives.

He later added: 'Sorry, with inflation we're making it £6.'

But this is the first the staff at The Half Moon have heard of it, with one member of staff telling Mail Online Food that they 'weren't sure at all at the moment'.

The Beckham's dining decision could be part of a new celeb trend as more and more stars have been spotted eating in British high street chains

The Beckham's dining decision could be part of a new celeb trend as more and more stars have been spotted eating in British high street chains.

Brad Pitt was seen chomping down a £6 cheeseburger at Wimpy's in Billericay, Essex and more recently Simon Cowell dined with his X Factor protégé Stevi Ritchie at  Harvester in Braintree, Essex.

Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said to MailOnline Food: 'David and Victoria Beckham and their family would be more than welcome to enjoy Xmas at a Wetherspoon pub.

'We have no confirmation that they plan to do this, but if they do, then they are certain to enjoy themselves in the relaxed atmosphere of one of our pubs.

'The food and drink will be excellent and the prices won't break the bank either.'
