My father's death made me stronger... He was my hero and I know I'm making him proud 

Play for England in the World Cup? I need to learn how to play union first! 

I hung up on Gladiator Russell Crowe the first time he called 

Sam Burgess admitted his first union passed 'in a blur' after helping Bath to an all-important bonus-point win that reignited their European Cup campaign.

The 25-year-old, making his first start since switching codes in October, looked lost at times but still made several telling contributions – three of which led to penalties for his side - as Horacio Agulla’s 78th minute try secured the bonus-point that moved Bath into second place in Pool 4 ahead of Glasgow, who play Toulose on Saturday afternoon.

Following two cameo appearances from the bench, the Bath faithful finally got their chance to see the 6ft 5in, 18st 5lb star in action from the start. He completed the full 80 minutes at inside centre and will have learned immeasurably more from playing a live match than all the training drills in the world could achieve.

Replacements: Webber, Auterac, Thomas, Hooper, Sisi, Young, Devoto, Agulla.

‘I don’t want to say I’m disappointed but it’s clear I’ve got a lot of things to work on,’ Burgess said.

‘I felt ok but there’s a lot of things I can get better at. There’s no hiding from that. There are a lot of different aspects of the game I’m enjoying learning. I’m pleased to get that full 80 minutes but it felt a bit of a blur at times. Overall I’m happy.’

Burgess’s three-quarter partner Matt Banahan scored a hat-trick of tries as Bath dominated their opponents for the second week running. But there was no doubt it was the former South Sydney Rabbitoh the 13,282 strong crowd had come to see.

‘Sam’s on the right track and he’ll have learned an unbelievable amount from playing a full 80 minutes,’ said Bath head coach Mike Ford. ‘Spending all week in at 12 he’ll have learned more than the whole time he’s been here.

‘It’ll be a couple of months before you see the real Sam Burgess. But what he’s done so far has been fantastic. We’re ready for all the criticism but we know what we’re doing.’

It will inevitably take the man recently described as the ‘greatest rugby league forward on the planet’ time to adapt to his new code. He made enough significant contributions against admittedly underwhelming French opponents to suggest he can make the grade.

Occasionally he looked lost defensively. But he will learn. He carried like an ox and made a string of thumping tackles.

‘For me Sam needs to be in the pack,’ Ford added. ‘The plan was to put him in the back row in the last 20 but the game was too tight He looked lost in defence a couple of times but he did some really good things.’

Burgess’s last start in rugby league saw him fracture his cheekbone seconds into the NRL Grand Final, only to play on and secure the man-of-the-match award, and a place in Australian sporting folklore in the process.

Burgess made an immediate impact on Friday night, albeit fortuitously, when he failed to gather a pass from No8 Leroy Houston only for the ball ricocheted off his hip and into the waiting Banahan’s hands, who scuttled in from 30 meters.

Television replays suggested Houston’s pass may have been forward but the try was awarded and Bath, and Burgess, were on their way as George Ford converted.

Moments later Burgess was involved again when he carried powerfully through the middle and earned his side a penalty as Montpellier’s forwards dived over the top of the ball.

There was brief concern as the international rugby league player of the year winced in pain and squinted while holding the left side of his face – which contains four steel plates following extensive surgery in October which delayed his union introduction.

But it proved a false alarm.

Ford slotted the ensuing penalty before Banahan scored his second try of the night courtesy of a superbly worked set piece move which used Burgess as a decoy runner only for the Bath fly-half to flip the ball behind his centre to blindside winger Semesa Rokoduguni who fed Jonathan Joseph and onto the giant winger.

Ford made it 17-0 midway through the first half and Bath continued to dominate the rest of the half without adding to their points tally.

Bath lost England lock Dave Attwood with a shoulder injury before the break with Stuart Hooper replacing him.

‘I don’t think Dave’s injury is too bad,’ said Ford.

Ford kicked his second penalty on 43 minutes as Bath moved into a 20 point lead.

Banahan chalked up his third try of the night on 52 minutes – which also saw Montpellier replacement Benoit Paile Laugue shown a yellow card for a dangerous tackle – before the visitors scored two consolation tries before Agulla’s telling last contribution.
