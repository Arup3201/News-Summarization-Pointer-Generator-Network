The decade that gave us Kurt Cobain, Kate 'n Johnny and a love of all things grunge is making a fashion come-back.

The fashion scene has been dominated by Nineties punk and grunge inspired styles this autumn and it seems that we just can't get enough of the dark-loving decade.

High Street stores and e-tailers have seen sales of grunge-inspired items soar, with sales of the grungy biker boot rising by more than double since last month, making them the nation's number one shoe of choice this season.

The 90s are back with a bang: The grunge trend is one of the most popular the only look to embrace this season - just ask Miley Cyrus and Little Mix - and sales of grunge styles are soaring

Inspired by the likes of Miley Cyrus, Gwen Stefani, Perrie Edwards and Jessie J, women across the UK have ditched their high heels in favour of heavy lace-ups.

Sales of black Dr Martens have shot up by 65 per cent on eBay, followed closely by dark blue and red coloured boots.

Booted up:  Miley Cyrus (L) and Ashlee Simpson both don classic black Dr Martens, and it seems the public is following suit

Cool style: Gwen Stefani (L) and Willow Smith show why Dr Martens have their reputation of alternative cool

Famous fans: Boho model Agyness Deyn (L) and singer Katy Perry sport Dr Martens, proving they are still the 'it' shoe

A spokesperson for eBay said: 'No Nineties look would be complete without a pair of grunge boots and with the trend set to continue into the winter there has never been a better time to invest in a pair.'

And eBay isn't the only company who have seen sales of the grunge boot soar.

The Debenhams Redhill boot is selling five times faster than the store's calf boots, while my-wardrobe's £249 Ash  tudded Buckle Viscous Boots are selling 70 per cent more than any other style.

Fashion stylist, Laura Puddy, said: '90s grunge is a huge trend for AW13. 

'The key to the grunge look is layering, think checked shirts, vests, beanies and dungarees.

'The look certainly wouldn't be complete without a great pair of boots, whether it's a pair of DMs or a pair with a super chunky sole and a heel - boots that were made for stomping are a must!'

Stylish: Katy Perry looked chic in her feminine ensemble, which she toughened up with studded biker boots

Taking on the trend: Abbey Crouch embraces the season's 90s trend in an all-black outfit teamed with her favourite biker boots

Celebrity stylist Jade Elliot said: 'The Grunge, grime and glamour from 90's fashion is back with a vengeance this season.

'The
grunge boots are my favourite fashion item. There's no rule that says 
you have to go dark with your outfit when wearing grunge boots. In fact, I am a big fan 
of lightweight floaty fabrics that contrast the harshness and toughness 
of the boot.

'Team with a lingerie style slip dress, oversized chunky knit cardigan and thick black tights to be bang on trend.'

Celebrity stylist, Courtney Smith, @CocoSmithStyle, said: 'Kate Bosworth is the ultimate celebrity to channel when looking for style inspiration for biker boots as she really does work them like a true style chameleon.

'For a softer look she works her biker boots with floaty skirts and dresses to give it a softer more feminine edge and equally when she wants to keep the look cool and tough she teams with skinny jeans and a leather jacket for the ultimate biker appeal.

'They are also great for dressed down Sundays teamed with jeans and a comfy knit.'

Polly Thrussell, ASOS Footwear Buyer, added: 'Our girl will be wearing these chunky boots with oversized knits layered over slip dresses, creating the ultimate grunge ensemble.'
