Andy Murray may have endured a miserable summer so far but he was back smiling once again as he was shown around Team Sky's Tour de France bus by team principal Sir Dave Brailsford.

The 2013 Wimbledon champion crashed out in the quarter-finals during the defence of his title at the All England Club and has slide to world number 10 - his lowest ranking since 2008.

He has also failed to beat any of the world's top-10 players so far this season as he continues to suffer a slump in form.

But he seemed to be enjoying himself as he was given a personalised tour of the Team Sky bus by Brailsford, the mastermind behind Britain's cycling success, during stage three of the Tour.

Le Tour fever: Andy Murray was shown around Team Sky's bus on Monday

Personal: Team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford gave Andy Murray a tour of the bus used during Tour de France

agony: Murray has slipped to 10th in the world rankings, his lowest placing since 2008

Marcel Kittel won his second stage of the 2014 Tour between Cambridge and London while Murray was being shown around by Brailsford.

And Brailsford seemed to have Murray on his mind as he cited the 2013 Wimbledon champion and 2012 Olympic gold medallist as part of his reasoning behind believing a French Tour de France champion would be a good thing.

'This is the biggest cycling event every year and it would be great for them if a French guy won it,' Brailsford said.

'(But) my focus is on doing everything I can to support Team Sky riders to be on the podium and to help Chris to win this race, to inspire people in this country to get involved and to keep on cycling.

'The comment was more about a national event, if it's won by the same nation's rider, what a fantastic thing that can be.

'We've seen it with Andy Murray. It would be an exciting thing to see.'

Controversy: Sky's Sir Dave Brailsford caused a stir by saying he wanted to help a Frenchman win a Tour
