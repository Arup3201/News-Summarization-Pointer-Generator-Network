Safe and well: Oil worker Malcolm Primrose, 61, has been found in Indonesia after being kidnapped by gunman who wanted Â£320,000

A British oil worker has been kidnapped by a group of armed men in Indonesia.

Engineer Malcolm Primrose, 61, was ambushed by an armed group as he travelled back from a mine site, reports said.

Mr Primrose is said to work for mining company Medco E&P and was in a car with his driver when confronted by the men at around 
11am local time in Lubuk Pempeng village, East Aceh district, officials 
said.

Police said six men armed with rifles and a pistol fired a warning shot into the air, forcing Mr Primrose's driver to stop as he drove the Briton from the gas company where he worked to his home in Seumali village.

Police Commander Muhajir, who uses only one name, said police and troops had spread out in the region but there was no sign of Scottish Mr Primrose or his attackers.

'The perpetrators forced the car to stop and tied up the driver,' said Commander Muhajir.

'They then forced Mr Primrose into their car, which had no number plates, and drove off with him.'

The driver, Dania Arani, managed to free himself and raised the alarm.

The men drove off toward the Ranto Peureulak subdistric, police chief Muhajir told the Jakarta Globe.

He told the paper: 'Police officers, with the help of soldiers, are combing the surrounding areas where the victim was kidnapped and the remote areas in Ranto Peureulak to hunt the perpetrators.'

Investigation: An Indonesian policeman walks past a car used by Malcolm Primrose who was kidnapped in Peureulak, East Aceh

Hunt: Armed police went out in several vehicles to try to find the missing Briton yesterday

Police do not know what the kidnappers' motive is because as yet they haven't contacted the authorities or Mr Primrose's employer

'We
 don't know what the kidnappers' motive is because as yet they haven't 
contacted the police or Mr Primrose's employer,' said commander Muhajir.

'We are doing all we can to find him and are using all available men in the hunt.'

A worker 'of British nationality was 
taken by force from his car by an unknown group of people near a working
 area on Tuesday around 11am', said the company's corporate 
secretary, Imron Gazali, in a statement, AsiaOne reported.

'The firm conveyed its deep concern 
to the worker's family and will continue to make the greatest effort 
possible for the person to be returned to his family as soon as 
possible,' he said.

Scotland's First Minister has said that they are working with the FCO to try and find the missing Briton.

Scene: Mr Primrose was kidnapped in Indonesia's Aceh province by at least six armed men, police said

Relief: Police and troops had spread out in the region but there was no sign of Mr Primrose or his attackers until earlier today

A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'We have spoken to the Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO), who have confirmed that a British national was involved in an incident in Aceh yesterday and that they are in touch with local authorities and his family.

'Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.'

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond told Real Radio Scotland at an event he attended in Ayrshire earlier today: 'We are concerned. We're in touch with the FCO and we're offering any assistance we can in terms of contact with relatives.

'We've had these situations before. We'll ensure that everything will be done to ensure his safe return to his family.'

There were no indications of shots being fired, the BBC reported local police saying.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of an incident and are in touch with the local authorities.'

A LinkedIn profile described him as a senior drilling supervisor at Medco E & P Malaka, and claimed he had previously worked in Russia and India in the oil industry.

The Government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office warned that there is a high threat from terrorism in Indonesia.

It says: 'Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks and have the capacity and intent to carry out these attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country.'

It advises visitors to 'exercise caution when travelling to Aceh, Central Sulawesi Province (especially Palu, Poso and Tentena), Maluku Province (especially Ambon), Papua and West Papua Province.'

The western coast of  Aceh was devastated by a tsunami in December 2004.

The tsunami, caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake., killed an estimated 170,000 people in Aceh and left about 500,000 homeless.

Just months later, in March 2005, a second off-shore earthquake measuring 9.1 on the Richter scale struck the sea bed near Aceh, killing a further 905 people and displacing f thousands more.
