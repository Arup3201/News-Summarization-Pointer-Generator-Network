Command Sgt. Maj. Martin R. Barreras died on Tuesday in a San Antonio military hospital from wounds sustained during his most recent deployment in Afghanistan

The soldier from Tucson has died from wounds suffered during 
an attack in Afghanistan, the Department of Defense announced Thursday.

Command Sgt. Maj. Martin R Barreras died on Tuesday in 
San Antonio Military Medical Center, officials said.

He had suffered 
wounds earlier this month when his unit was attacked by enemy forces with small arms fire in Herat Province, 
Afghanistan, the Department of Defense said.

The 49-year-old was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 5th 
Infantry, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division in Fort Bliss, 
Texas. He became the top enlisted soldier for the battalion in March 2013.

Soldiers from the battalion were deployed to Afghanistan in December. The 1st Armored Division, also known as 'Old Ironsides,' dates 
back to before World War II.

Barreras was part of the U.S. Special Operations Forces who rescued POW Jessica Lynch in April 1, 2003.

Private First Class Lynch was seriously injured and captured when her convoy was ambushed by Iraqi forces.

Her subsequent rescue thrust her into the media spotlight and was the first successful rescue of an American prisoner of war since Vietnam and the first ever of a woman.

His vast number of awards include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal with V device, Bronze Star with three oak leaf clusters and the Purple Heart with one oak leaf cluster.

His colleague, Lt. Col. Edward Brady told The Army Times: 'Command Sgt. Maj. Barreras was my friend and battle buddy.

'I’ve spent more time with him than my wife since I’ve taken command. I believe that I was the luckiest battalion commander in the Army to have him as my command sergeant major.'

He added: 'While every soldier in this formation is extremely saddened by his loss, his Bobcats are doing exactly what he would expect of us: continuing on with the mission and taking the fight to the enemy. This man would do absolutely anything and everything to ensure his soldiers came home safely.'

In a statement, Representative Ron Barber, (D-Tucson), called Barreras a brave member of the United States Army.

'Command Sgt. Maj. Barreras's death is a reminder that 
although the United States is winding down our combat role in 
Afghanistan, we still have men and women who are placing themselves in 
harm's way every day,' Barber said.

'I thank each one of them, as well 
as their families, for their service and for their sacrifice.'

Barreras is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.
