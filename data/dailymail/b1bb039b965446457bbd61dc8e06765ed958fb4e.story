Property prices could take another eight years to recover from the recession and regain their 2007 value, according to forecasts by an estate agent.

Homeowners in Wales, North Yorkshire and the North West will wait the longest to see the value of their property return to pre-recession value according to Knight Frank.

In Wales, prices won't return to their average peak of £154,696 until 2021 with the current market value more than £20,000 down to less than £132,000.

Recession hit: Property prices in some areas could take until 2021 to reach pre-recession levels according to estate agent Knight Frank

In both Yorkshire and the North West, prices will not hit 2007 heights again until 2020, in what is likely to be the slowest housing market recovery in economic history.

London will see the quickest recovery, with prices expected to return to their 2007 £303,739 average as early as next year.

The capital is still regarded as something of a property hotspot in the global market with properties in prime locations rising by more than half since 2009 and up nine per cent during 2012.

Overall, there is something of a north-south divide, with prices in the South East to hit peak levels by 2016 and East Anglia by 2017.

Grainne Gilmore, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, said: 'Some five years after the start of the financial crisis the housing sector in Britain still does not bear the hallmarks of a fully functioning market.

'Transaction levels have roughly halved since the last market peak in 2007 and are 35 per cent below the 20 year average.

'First time buyers and those further up the ladder are struggling with tighter mortgage lending.'

Property prospects

Liam Bailey, head of residential research at the company, said that the double-dip recession and the threat of a triple dip, has helped to 'weigh on purchaser sentiment'.

UK-wide, Knight Frank expects it to be 2019 before the nationwide housing market is up to speed, with a 2 per cent increase in sales expected for 2013.

Last year wasn't all bad for homeowners depending on where you live and what type of house you own.

Those with homes close to the see saw values rise by 56 per cent with the luxury property market seeing price gains of 45 per cent in 2012.

London's continuing property boom did not just extend to prime central locations in 2012, with areas such as Wandsworth, Hampstead and Richmond seeing price increases of five per cent.

Not coining it in: While London's property market seems to be going from strength to strength due to international demand, the rest of the UK is struggling

Despite
it more than likely being the slowest recovery for house prices from a 
recession, the property market has not suffered as sharp a fall as 
during recession in the early 1990s, when values dropped by a fifth.

This time around, house prices have fallen an average of 12 per cent.

Many
of those who bought property expecting a certain profitable return are 
having to rethink their plans with the introduction of a seven per cent 
rate of stamp duty in March not expected to help the market.

Building
society Nationwide said last week that house prices had dropped by just
over a per cent in 2012, with a fall of 0.1 per cent in December alone.

That fall reversed 2011's one per cent increase in house prices.

The
price of houses in the UK remains just over five times the average 
salary but most experts expect the market to remain slow until property 
becomes more affordable.
