Danny Boyle nearly quit as artistic director of the London 2012 Olympics on multiple occasions due to rows over penny pinching, it has been revealed.

He has also threatened to resign in order to get his own way, he has said in a new book which delves into Boyle's experience of last year's Games.

Boyle said he became 'unbelievably unpleasant' in meetings with Locog and refused to work from their 'bland corporate' offices in Canary Wharf.

In Danny Boyle: Creating Wonder - in conversation with Amy Raphael, it is revealed that despite running up costs of £27million for the opening ceremony, the Oscar-winning director said one of the main causes for disputes with organisers was over costs.

He became riled after organisers tried to sell volunteers their ceremony costumes, rather than allowing them to keep the outfits as souvenirs.

He said: 'Of course, Locog decided to ditch the tradition in favour of selling the costumes to the volunteers. I said they must be joking.

'We won in the end, and they took them home without having to pay.'

Boyle was also riled when the 
organisers made the 'ridiculous' proposal of providing one drum for 
every five drummers due to budget constraints.

'I
wasn't asking for high-quality drums. Just the kind you see guys 
playing outside Liverpool Lime Street or McDonalds...We decided to use 
plastic drums,' he said.

Boyle
also admitted his threats of resigning were 'useful' in getting his own
way. Organisers initially wanted the Olympic cauldron to be on the 
roof, but Boyle demanded the structure be fixed to the stadium floor.

But
throwing his weight about did not always work for Boyle. One of his 
greatest triumphs of the ceremony was persuading the Queen to take part 
in a comical film with James Bond actor Daniel Craig.

Boyle
lamented that his original plan to use a Paul Farley poem in the scene 
was vetoed because it ends with the line: 'Jesus, I'm the f****** 
Queen!'

He said: 'For some reason the powers that be weren't keen.'

The line: 'Jesus, I'm the f****** Queen!' was omitted from the clip featuring Daniel Craig and the Queen

After ground-to-air missiles were deployed on buildings in east London close to the Olympic stadium the 56-year-old director said he came 'close to walking away'.

Similar moral quandries also led artist Damian Hirst and scriptwriter Frank Cottrel-Boyce to threaten resignation from their roles as part of the Games.

The two were appalled after details emerged of a £7million sponsorship deal with Dow chemicals, the firm linked to a company involved in the Bhopal gas disaster in India which killed 15,000 people.

Hirst pulled out of designing a fabric wrap for the stadium, which was set to transform the venue into a Hanging Garden covered in ivy. But Hirst did subsequently provide other works for the closing ceremony.
