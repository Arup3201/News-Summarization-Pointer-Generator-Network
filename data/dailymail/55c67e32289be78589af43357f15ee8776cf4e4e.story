A 64-year-old serial sleepwalker has fitted a child gate to the top of his stairs to keep him safe after almost being killed falling down them.

Barry Coleman suffered a broken back and ribs in the horrifying accident which happened as he took a nocturnal walkabout at his home in Shepton Mallet, Somerset.

The shop worker, who suffered severe memory loss after blood clots formed on his brain, decided to take action to prevent a repeat of the fall that nearly killed him.

Precautions: Serial sleepwalker Barry Coleman from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, has fitted a baby gate to the top of his stairs after nearly dying when he fell down them

Injuries: The fall, which happened as he slept walked, left Mr Coleman with a broken back, ribs, arms and thumbs. He also suffered from blood clots in his brain which left him with memory loss

Injuries: He was fitted with a head and neck brace following the fall due to the severity of his injuries

Mr Coleman has been helped to make a full recovery by his wife Valerie, and the couple now plan to renew their wedding vows for their 25th wedding anniversary.

He has slept walked all his life but this accident is the worst he has suffered.

Mrs Coleman said: 'I was really tired and I'd turned off all the lights in the house, whereas normally I leave a couple on. Barry fell asleep in his chair and then must have come up to bed later.

'When he started sleepwalking he must have been really disorientated and fell down the stairs.

'I knew immediately what had happened and when I first saw him at the bottom of the stairs I thought I'd lost him.'

Mr Coleman was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, where he was fitted with a head brace and a neck collar - which he hopes will be removed in a couple of months.

'A few bangs on the head means my memory isn't what it used to be and having been sitting on my backside for five months means that everything isn't working as it should be,' he said.

'I can't wait to get this brace off.

'My advice to anyone else who sleepwalks is to take someone with you, and get a stair gate.'

Mrs Coleman said the accident had brought the couple closer together.

'It doesn't matter what life throws at me now, I know nothing will be as bad as what we've been through,' she said.
