Nine members of Jamaica's Under 17 side required treatment after they were involved in a freak lift accident during their team's stay at the Hilton Princess hotel in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.

The Jamaican youth team players entered the lift on the third floor of the hotel but were shocked when they found themselves having to worm their way out of the ground floor car park.

Demar James and Deshane Beckford were admitted into hospital after sustaining minor injuries.

The hotel lift at the Hilton Princess in San Pedro Sula, Honduras plummeted to the ground floor car park  

Garfield Fuller, head of Jamaica's delegation, told the Jamaica Observer: 'The players are pretty scared and frightened and one player mentioned it was like a heart attack because of the pace at which the elevator crashed to the ground.

'We just give God thanks that we didn’t experience the worst.'

Jamaica's FA president Captain Horace Burrell added that he was planning to take action against those that were responsible for the incident.

'We want to ensure that the players’ welfare is looked after down the road if an injury is experienced and can be substantiated because of this,' said Burrell.

'I don’t want to leave them out on a limb, so I am taking legal steps to ensure that the players’ interests are being protected in a comprehensive way.'

Meanwhile, hotel general manager Anthony Corbin said he was 'taken aback with what happened' and was 'very sorry' that the incident occurred.
