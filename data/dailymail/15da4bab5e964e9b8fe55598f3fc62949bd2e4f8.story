Every bank cashier must dread one day hearing the words ‘hands up’.

But the one targeted by this robber didn’t hear a thing. Instead they were handed a chilling note that read: ‘£5,000 now – ssshhhh!!! Or I’ll shoot.’

The thief didn’t say a word during the raid at a NatWest in Salford. He  simply placed the handwritten note on the counter.

The cashier handed him just over £2,000 in cash, and the villain calmly walked out.

Some of the cash was later found abandoned nearby. It was covered in security dye which had activated shortly after the raid.

Police believe the robber, who was wearing a thick woollen hat and a black snood, may have been  covered in the ink.

They said there was no proof he was 
actually carrying a gun. Officers hope CCTV footage of the thief, along 
with the handwriting on the note, will help track him down.

Some of the dye-covered money was found dumped on the pavement nearby.

Police
issued CCTV pictures of the robber and released an image of the note in
the hope that a member of the public will recognise his handwriting.

Det
Con Allan Barker, of Swinton CID, said: 'The bank robber calmly walked 
up to a staff member, handed over a threatening note and then left with 
some cash.

'Thanks to the 
security measures in place, a sizeable amount of the cash has been 
recovered after the security dye activated. I am appealing for witnesses
to come forward.

'We would like to ask people: Were 
you in the area and did you see a man activate the dye? Did you see 
someone that day who perhaps had stained hands or dye on his clothing?

'Do you recognise the handwriting or 
words used in the note? Someone knows who this person is and we need 
your help to bring him to justice.
