Budweiser's new Super Bowl commercial is a heartwarming account of a lost puppy's trek back home with the help of a few of Clydesdale horses -- and is set to air on February 1 as the Seattle Seahawks play the New England Patriots.

At the start of 'Lost Dog', a rancher is seen leading a Clydesdale into a stall. A puppy then pokes his head out of hay in the stall and runs out of the stable, while looking back at the horse.

Once outside, however, the curious puppy spies a truck with its back door open, runs over and hops inside. However, the pooch gets trapped when the door suddenly shuts. 

Why hello there! The puppy pokes its head out of a haystack then rushes out the door

Breaking free: The puppy soon races past the rancher and a Clydesdale horse 

Trapped: The puppy looks back at the truck door after it suddenly shuts 

Have you seen me? The farm's rancher is seen posting a sign looking for the pooch

The advertisement, which premiered on Today, is set to a soundtrack of The Proclaimers' 'I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)' covered by Sleeping at Last.

The puppy jumps out of the truck when it's stopped in traffic and runs down a street. Now lost, the puppy shelters in a box when it starts to rain before traversing a muddy field in the darkness.

While the puppy is away from home, the rancher is seen tending to a horse in the stable looking forlorn and posting a 'lost dog' sign on a tree. 

The puppy - covered in mud - finally makes its way down a hill toward the farm it calls home, only to be faced by a growling wolf.

Huddled up: The puppy gets out of the truck and at one point takes shelter in a box during the rain 

Homecoming: The puppy finally makes its way back toward the farm to be with the rancher and the Clydesdale horses after its long journey 

As the two unequally matched canines have a standoff, several Clydesdales break free from their stalls and run to serve as the puppy's backup, scaring the snarling wolf away. 

But as it grows light, the rancher looks out of his window and sees the puppy and the Clydesdales running back toward the farm and the group are reunited.

The puppy and the Clydesdales were first used together for marketing the Super Bowl in 2014. The company's 2013 and 2014 campaigns won Ad Meter Crowns, Today reported.

Director Jake Scott told Today 'Without giving it away too much, we're focused more maybe on the puppy than in past. Telling the story through the puppy's eyes.'

'I'm a glorified extra,' actor Don Jeanes, who plays the rancher, told the television show. 'I understand that. You can't compete. Hey, what's the kid's name from "Lassie"? I don't know.'

AdWeek reported that the advertisement features eight different puppies and seven Clydesdales trained for their roles.

Upset: The rancher is seen embracing a horse and looking forlorn in the wake of the puppy's disappearance 

Threat: A growling wolf soon emerges and confronts the puppy before it can make it back safely 

Reunited and it feels so good: The Clydesdales and the puppy race home after their adventure - as the rancher looks out the window 

Stunned: The rancher sees the group head back toward the farm 

All together now: A Clydesdale and the puppy are seen back in the stable with the rancher - holding a Budweiser beer, naturally
