A toddler has died after falling into his grandparents' pond while he played in their garden.

A neighbour who witnessed the emergency services' frantic efforts to save the three-year-old, named as Callum Greenwood, said he knew instantly that 'something terrible had happened'. 

Callum was found 10 minutes after he was reported missing at a relative's address in Elswick Road, Newcastle, around 6.45pm yesterday. 

Tragedy: A police officer at a house in Newcastle where a three-year-old boy died as he played in a pond

Two Police Community Support Officers were standing outside a large, detached property, which was believed to be the home of the grieving mother's parents.

The £300,000 stone property, which stands next to St John's Cemetery, is protected from the road by tall trees and a high stone wall.

Next-door neighbour Paul Taylor, 37, a plasterer, said: 'I'd been out to get an Indian and when I came back there was a massive police search on.

'They had closed off the road and the ambulance was there.

'I saw somebody in a blanket being carried into the ambulance.

'I thought obviously something terrible had happened but I didn't know what.'

He added: 'It's hard to believe this has happened to someone of that age.'

His partner, Emma Taylor, 38, said: 'We could see people crying and screaming. A woman was hysterical.

'When we saw someone being bundled into the ambulance, we still didn't know.

'The people next door are very private. We have since heard the boy was their daughter's child, who had come for a visit.'

A man at the property, which is set back from the road, declined to comment.

Callum was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, but doctors were unable to save him.

Superintendent Mick Paterson, of Northumbria Police, said last night: 'This is an incredibly tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time.

'They are understandably absolutely devastated and officers with specialist training are providing them with support.'

He said officers were carrying out an inquiry and will prepare a report for the coroner.
