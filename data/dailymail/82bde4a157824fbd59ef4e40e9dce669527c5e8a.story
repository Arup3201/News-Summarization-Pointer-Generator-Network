Twitter users are accusing Trevor Noah, Jon Stewart's successor, of antisemitism for comments made about Jews in tweets dating back to 2009.

The South African comedian, who is little-known in the United States, rocketed to national fame on Monday after he was named the new host of The Daily Show.

But the excitement and curiosity was tinged by a slew of people calling on the 31-year-old - who is a quarter Jewish - to apologize for 'offensive' comments.

In May last year, Noah, a contributor to The Daily Show, tweeted: 'Behind every successful Rap Billionaire is a double as rich Jewish man. #BeatsByDreidel.'

Accusations: Trevor Noah, the South African and quarter-Jewish comedian taking over The Daily Show, has been accused of antisemitism

This is one of the five tweets dating back to 2009 that bloggers are dragging up and complaining about

A year earlier, he said: 'Note to self - Langostines are not Jewish prawns.'

And during a soccer match in January 2012, he joked: 'Messi gets the ball and the real players try foul him, but Messi doesn't go down easy, just like jewish chicks. #ElClasico.'

The tweets are now being posted online by enraged bloggers, slamming Noah as 'racist'.

One Twitter user said: 'Jon Stewart, born Leibowitz, won't be happy about these highly antisemitic tweets.'

A blogger posted Noah's tweets in an article, with the comment: 'Trevor Noah, the racist, hack taking over for Jon Stewart is also quite the anti-Semite too. Obama and progressive liberals really will love this guy. Among some of the skits that Trevor Noah came up with was the Black Hitler.'

Noah joined The Daily Show as a correspondent just three months ago.

He won over viewers with his 'outsider' account of the U.S.

'I never thought I’d be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa. It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days, back home,' he joked during one episode. 

His dry, cutting humor has been singled out by producers as the winning formula to win over viewers lamenting the end of Stewart's 16-year stint.

According to The New York Times, a slew of better-known potential replacements chose to move on to competing networks.

However, the reaction to his appointment was overwhelmingly positive.

The son of a half-Jewish Xhosa mother and Swiss father, Noah speaks an impressive six languages and is expected to bring a more international perspective to The Daily Show.

Viewers have lamented the end of Jon Stewart's 16-year stint on the show

Successor: The 31-year-old South African comedian (pictured in 2012) has been named successor to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the show this year

Appearance: In 2012, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to feature on NBC's The Tonight Show (pictured). In 2013, he became the first to appear on CBS's Late Show With David Letterman

Tough act to follow: Noah was not surprisingly reverent of extremely popular departing host Jon Stewart as he tweeted Monday about the news he's the next host

'He brings such a unique worldview and a deep understanding of human nature, which makes his comedy so insightful,' Comedy Central president Michele Ganeless told the Times. 'He's truly a student of the world.'

Noah also brings a wealth of hosting experience helping him, in Ganeless' words, check 'off every box' on her network's list of requirements.

Also important: he has kindred spirit Stewart's blessing.

'All I needed in my life was Jon's blessing. That's what I have, so I'm looking forward to being part of The Best Damn News Show in the World,' he told the AP. 

Speaking to the Times from Dubai, where's he's completing a comedy tour, Noah said: 'You don't believe it for the first few hours. You need a stiff drink, and then unfortunately you're in a place where you can't really get alcohol.'

Born to a black mother and white father in South Africa, 31-year-old Noah was not allowed to live with either parent and even passed off by family as albino because, under apartheid laws, different races could not mix

Trevor Noah, 31, grew up in Soweto, South Africa, the son of a Xhosa mother and Swiss father.

'My mother had to be very clandestine about who my father was,' Noah told the Times. 'He couldn't be on my birth certificate.'

For much of his childhood, his African family passed him off as an albino.

Under apartheid laws, different races could not mix and he was not allowed to live with either of his parents. 

He reportedly once cracked to an audience, 'I was born a crime.'

Noah began doing stand-up in South Africa in his twenties and has since leveraged his ability to speak six languages into an international career.

He's hosted his own late-night show in South Africa, radio shows and awards shows. 

Noah is also the only South African comedian to ever perform on The Late Show and Tonight Show.

But don't be too quick to connect him to the Dark Continent. He told Letterman in 2013:

'They make it sound like a guy in leopard skin's going to come running on the stage.'

Nonetheless, Noah's past is firmly rooted in South Africa's turbulent racial history.

'I didn't live a normal life,' he told the Times. 'I grew up in a country that wasn't normal.'

More specifically, Noah says that after he began to do stand-up in his 20s, he quickly became aware that 'speaking freely about anything, as a person of color, was considered treason.'

News of his new role spread quickly in South Africa.

'Over the years, Mr. Noah has proved that laughter is the best medicine and has helped our country and its people to find healing through laughing at themselves,' said Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa.

'South Africa is a microcosm of the world and there is no doubt that a global audience will find resonance in his humor,' he added in an email.
