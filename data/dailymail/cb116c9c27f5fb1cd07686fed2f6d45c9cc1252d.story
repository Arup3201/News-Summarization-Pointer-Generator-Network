Jonny Evans continued his rehabilitation from an ankle injury with a run-out for Manchester United's Under 21 side against Southampton on Monday night.

Evans has not featured for Louis van Gaal's side since picking up the injury in his side's 5-3 loss to Leicester City in September. 

It was Evans's second low-key game as he featured for the United's reserve side that beat Blackburn Rovers 5-0 in the Lancashire Senior Cup last week.

The Northern Irishman returned to training just under two weeks ago, but Tuesday night's Premier League clash with Stoke will come too soon.

Evans's return to fitness is a timely boost for United boss Louis van Gaal after Daley Blind suffered a knee injury on international duty with Holland recently.
