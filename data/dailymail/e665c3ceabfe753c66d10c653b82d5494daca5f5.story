A billionaire oligarch has been named Britain’s richest man as the staggering wealth of foreign billionaires based in London is laid bare.

Alisher Usmanov, who was born in Uzbekistan, owns almost one-third of Arsenal Football Club and is said to be worth £13.3billion.

Usmanov, 59, owns Sutton Place, the 
former Surrey home of the oil baron J. Paul Getty, as well as a 
£48million mansion in London.

He is married to Irina Viner, 64, the head coach of Russia’s rhythmic gymnastics team.

While the latest Sunday Times Rich List is dominated by obscure foreign-born businessmen, there are also household names such as actors Sacha Baron Cohen and Daniel Craig, who both appear on the list for the first time.

The Bond star, 45, shares a fortune of £40million with his wife Rachel Weisz, while the creator of Ali G and Borat is worth around £68million.

Mr Usmanov, who occupies the top spot, served six years in a Soviet jail in the Eighties after being convicted of fraud and extortion, although his conviction was later overturned.

According to the Rich List,
his wealth has increased thanks to his Russian business empire which 
started with making plastic bags and includes the production of iron 
ore, an internet company and a controlling share in Russia’s second 
biggest mobile phone firm.

He replaces steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal, who now drops to fourth place after eight years in the top spot.

The steel magnate, now worth 
£10billion, is the biggest faller in wealth terms.

The 40 per cent stake he and his wife Usha
hold in the steelmaking giant ArcelorMittal has plummeted from £28billion at its peak to £5.95billion.

In second place is Russian-born Len 
Blavatnik, whose rise in wealth from £3.4billion last year to £11 
billion this year, makes him the highest riser in wealth terms.

Mr Blavatnik owns Warner Music, and received £2billion last month for his stake in Russian oil project TNK-BP.

Third place goes to Sri and Gopi Hinduja who made their £10.6billion in industry and finance.

The list highlights the 
dominance of foreign oligarchs who have bought up swathes of Central 
London, with only one British-born person in the top 10 - the Duke of 
Westminster is is eighth place thanks to his £7.8billion fortune.

And
most of the wealthiest figures are men, with Britain's richest woman 
being Kirsty Bertarelli, who as Kirsty Roper came second in 1988's Miss 
World pageant before marrying Swiss pharmaceutical boss Ernest 
Bertarelli, with whom she shares a net worth of £7.4billion.

Lower
down the list, one notable new entry is financial expert Martin Lewis, 
40, who has obviously been following his own advice as he has amassed 
wealth of £60million.

The list of richest Britons under 30 
is dominated by inherited wealth - but it also features a number of 
internet whizkids and glamorous young entertainers.

Daniel
Ek, the 30-year-old Spotify boss, Pete Cashmore, 27, founder of 
Mashable, and 29-year-old Sam Barnett, who set up online advertising 
firm Struq have each been valued at more than £50million.

Daniel
Radcliffe, Robert Pattinson and Adele are also in the top 20 on the 
youth list thanks to their successful showbiz careers.

The
number of billionaires in the UK has increased ten-fold since the 
Sunday Times Rich List was first published in 1989, shooting from nine 
to 88. There were 77 last year.

According
to the list, the 1,000 richest people in Britain have wealth totalling 
almost £450billion - up nearly eight per cent on last year, a sign that 
the top ranks of society are prospering despite mass unemployment and 
the threat of a triple-dip recession.

The
combined wealth of the top 200 people is £318.2billion, a more than 
eightfold rise on the £38billion for the combined wealth of the 200 
people featured in the first list.

In
1989, the Queen topped the list with total wealth of £5.2billion. This 
valuation included all the Crown Estates and the royal art collection. 
In later years, the Queen has been valued solely on her personal wealth 
and no longer topped the list after 1993.

Roman
Abramovich, who owns Arsenal’s rivals Chelsea and amassed his fortune 
through Russian oil and aluminium, is ranked as the fifth richest 
resident with £9.3billion – £200million down on last year.
