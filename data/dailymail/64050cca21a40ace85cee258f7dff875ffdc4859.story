The daughter of one of two elderly women murdered in their northern NSW nursing home has spoken of her heartache as police continue the hunt for their killer.

Marie Darragh, 82 and Isobella Spencer, 77, were found unconscious in their beds on May 10 by staff at St Andrews Village nursing home in Ballina.

Police have confirmed they are 'looking at the actions of all nursing home staff' in relation to the deaths and are examining what medications the elderly residents were given.

Marie Darragh, 82, was one of two women found unconscious in their beds on May 10 by staff at St Andrews Village nursing home in Ballina

Ms Darragh, who was on the brink of death when she moved to the Ballina nursing home three years ago, managed to turn her health around after she quit smoking.

Her daughter, Janet Parkinson, said her mother's new-found health and happiness made the suspected murder so much harder to deal with.

'It's total heartbreak,' Ms Parkinson said on Thursday.

'Because when she went in there she was ready to die. She was so frail and it has taken them three and a half years to get her where she was.

'They built her up and she had to go this way ... that's the heartbreaking thing.'

Ms Darragh's daughter, Charli Matterson, told the ABC her mum had lived at the home for three years and was healthy at the time she died

The women were pronounced dead before paramedics arrived just before Mother's Day.

A third elderly woman at the nursing home was attacked on the same night but survived. She is understood to be helping police with their investigation and her name has not been released.

The nursing home said she is in good health and is back at the facility after a stint in hospital.

Detectives believe they have a good idea how both women died and have questioned nursing home staff.

'Obviously we are looking at the actions of staff members that night. However, we are keeping an open mind,' Detective Superintendent Mick Willing said on Wednesday.

'The fact that these deaths occurred in unexpected circumstances on the same night, in the same location, prompted an immediate response from homicide investigators.'

Ms Parkinson said she had her own suspicions about what happened, but could not speak highly enough of the nursing home staff.

'Obviously I have missed something,' she said.

Ms Darragh, a grandmother to 11 and mother of three, had 'loved' living at the nursing home, according to her daughter.

Police have not disclosed any further details about the women's deaths but said there was no 'existing threat' at the nursing home.

'I want to make it absolutely clear that we believe this is an isolated incident,' Det Supt Willing said.

'There is nothing to suggest the women's deaths are in any way linked to deaths in other nursing homes.'

Det Supt said the management and staff at St Andrews Village nursing home have been very supportive of the detectives managing the case.

Police say the killer may have been a staff member at the northern NSW nursing home and detectives have examined what medications the elderly residents were given

The manager of the nursing home, Phillip Carter, said that the cause of the women's deaths was still unknown but that the deaths have 'deeply distressed staff, residents and their families'.

'The police have advised me they do not have conclusive information on the causes of death at this stage,' he said.

'St Andrews acted immediately to involve the police because the deaths were unexpected.

'We understand the pain of losing a loved one and we are doing all we can to assist police.'

He also said he knew nothing about the assault on the third woman.

'All I've been told is there's an investigation because of two unexpected deaths. They haven't consulted with me about anyone else being assaulted or tampered with,' he told MailOnline.
