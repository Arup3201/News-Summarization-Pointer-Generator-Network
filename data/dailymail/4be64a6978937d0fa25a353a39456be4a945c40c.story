These are the two teenage girls who died today after their car ploughed into a ditch - just a week after one of their friends was killed on the same stretch of road.

Shaya Leigh, 18, died at the scene of the horror crash close to Swindon while best friend Kerry Staniford, 17, died later in hospital.

Three men, aged between 19 and 20, were taken to hospital by air. Two are fighting for their lives, while the third is recovering from his injuries.

It also emerged this evening that Miss Staniford was a
friend of a 20-year-old Jack Savage, who died on the same stretch of road just a
week ago. The recruitment co-ordinator was a passenger in a Ford Fiesta which collided with an articulated lorry at 3.57am last 
Saturday.

'The other two chaps are also 20 and from the Swindon area.

'They have been taken to Frenchay and they have both been in surgery 
today. I believe they are now out of surgery and in intensive care.

Kerry knew recruitment co-ordinator Jack Savage - a passenger in a Ford 
Fiesta, which collided with an articulated lorry at 3.57am last 
Saturday.

sliproad from the A419 northbound, leading on to the Commonhead 
roundabout.

Kerry, and fellow death crash victim Shaya, were students together at New College in Swindon.

Tributes to the victims have been pouring in on Twitter and Facebook.

Miss Staniford's cousin Kelly Magee said: 'My heart is about to burst in my chest with the pain I feel.

Police found the grey Renault Clio with 'substantial damage' in undergrowth about 20 metres from the road.

the Swindon area and aged 19 or 20,' said the police spokesman.

'The 19-year-old female driver was pronounced dead at the scene.

'A second female was later pronounced dead at Great Western Hospital in Swindon.

'Two of the male passengers are described as being 'very poorly' at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. A third male is being treated for his injuries at GWH.'
