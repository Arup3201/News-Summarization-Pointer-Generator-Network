If Saido Berahino makes it into the full England squad next month then nobody at West Brom will be more proud of him than James Morrison.

After seven years at the club Scottish international Morrison is passionate about Albion's prospects – an attitude that spilled over last season during a furious dressing room row in which a punch was allegedly thrown at the young striker.

In the fall-out to the incident there were fears that Berahino might try to force a move – and former player Peter Odemwingie claimed he'd been picked on during his time at the club.

But as Albion take on Manchester United at the Hawthorns on Monday Morrison is unrepentant about the incident and says the club's senior players are not bullies but simply proud to set high standards.

And with Berahino earning rave reviews as the Premier League's top English goal scorer so far, he revealed: 'We have just had a meeting about standards. The manager sets them really well and demands us as players to meet them every day.

'He starts it and we follow. I wouldn't say there is bullying involved, I just think it is professionals trying to be the best that they can be.

'The dressing room is 100 per cent a better place now. New players have come in and mingled really well, and we have got a few good leaders in there.

'And as for Saido, he has been terrific, his goal scoring speaks for itself. You give the lad a chance and he will put it away, he's proven that, and he's even stepping up for penalties.'

Morrison has been at the heart of Albion's bright start to the season, played by new boss Irvine in a deeper role that he repeated with success for Scotland in last week's Euro 2016 qualifiers.

And he's relishing the football which Irvine, initially an unpopular choice among the club's fans, is encouraging the team to play.

The 28-year-old said: 'We are trying to pass the ball a lot more. If you look at the Burnley game we played something like 600 passes. The Geeks in the back room say that was Barcelona standard.

'I think we had 11 new players as well as a new manager so it was going to take time, but everybody has got fit, we have a group who are willing to work for the manager. That's the start, and now we need to keep going.

'Everybody has gelled just on the training pitch. We've had a lot of fun, the coaching staff have put on good sessions, and that is how we have got together, as simple as that.'

Now Albion aim to prove it after studying how Leicester shocked United's star-studded side in their last away game.

Morrison said: 'We are working on some stuff going into the game thinking we can hurt them. We think that they love to go forward and that leaves some opportunities to hit them on the counter.'
