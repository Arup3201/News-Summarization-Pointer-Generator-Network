Waste: Dr Susan Jebb, who is a nutrition scientist in Oxford and NHS adviser, says 'people pour millions of pounds down the drain' on fad diets

The NHS believes fad dieters are 'pouring millions down the drain' and has put together its own 12-week plan to help people lose weight after Christmas.

Health service experts have sought to 
debunk some of the hundreds of diets people pay to use every New Year, claiming some are dangerous and have no scientific or nutritional credence.

Their free week-by-week programme cuts 600kcal from the daily intake of men and women to help them lose around 2lb every week.

The NHS Weight Loss plan limits men to 1,900kcal a day and women to 1,400kcal a day mixed with 20 minutes exercise every day.

'Every year, people pour millions of pounds down the drain to no avail following one fad diet or another,' Oxford University professor Susan Jebb told the Daily Telegraph.

The Government advisor went on: 'There is no easy way to lose weight, but the NHS Weight Loss guide is full of valuable tips and support to help you put your good intentions into practice.

'It is free, straightforward and based on the best available evidence of what helps people to succeed in losing weight.

'Research shows that monitoring what you eat and how active you are can make a real difference to your success, so use the food and activity charts to check that you are sticking to your plans.' 

The NHS diet has been put together with 
the help of the British Dietetic Association to ensure people lose 
weight at a safe rate.

Example: The NHS plan is a week-by-week guide that experts say will help people safely lose 2lb per week 

The plan, which is available online, contains tips on healthy snacks, how to stay fuller for longer and the problem of comfort eating, and claims that it cuts the odds of piling weight back on afterwards.

Users get a exercise, five-a-day checklist and calorie intake chart to stick to the family fridge.

'There are no promises of dropping
 a stone in five days, no cutting out entire food groups, no starving 
yourself, no gimmicks – just sensible and practical weight loss advice 
based on the best available evidence of what works,' an NHS England spokesman said.
