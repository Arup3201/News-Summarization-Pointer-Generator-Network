An animal welfare group has created a moving video featuring Australian children pleading with McDonald's to stop using cage eggs.

Animals Australia put a call out to kids to upload a video message encouraging McDonald's to switch to free range eggs, and compiled some of the best entries to make a short video.

'Hi, my name's Maple, I don't want chickens to be in cages because I want them to be free and happy,' one young girl says.

'Chickens have feelings too,' another young boy says.

Two other boys then chime in, telling the camera: 'Chickens need to flap and stretch their wings… but battery hens can't'.

A boy dressed up in a waistcoat and glasses then points to a drawing on a chalkboard and says: 'It would be much better if they were happy in the grass.'

McDonald's uses 91 million cage eggs per year in Australia but does not use cage eggs in the UK or Europe, and is phasing them out in New Zealand.

Animals Australia campaign director Lyn White said the organisation had been in discussion with McDonald's Australia about phasing out caged eggs for seven years.

'Until now, we had refrained from publicly identifying their failure to meet their global guiding principles on animal welfare in hoping that through consultation they would match commitments made in other countries,' Ms White said.

'As they have failed to move on this issue, based on not having enough public feedback to warrant a transition, it was appropriate to start ensuring that they did.'

Ms White added that she hoped McDonald's would recognise the 'commercial benefits of positively responding to a plea from Australian kids'.  

'A significant number of McDonald's' customer base is children, children who love animals, and who don't accept that hens should be kept in cages,' she said.

'It seems that children themselves understand that you cannot have "Happy Meals" if animals are suffering.'

A McDonald's spokeswoman said the company is exploring a move to cage-free eggs but it was not a straight-forward decision.

'We are working through a number of issues with our suppliers, including the fact that there are not currently enough available cage-free eggs in Australia to meet our needs,' she said in a statement.

'This means that change will progress over time. For example, as a first step we are looking at converting to cage-free eggs for our omelettes in McCafé.'

The spokeswoman added that McDonald's had to consider the impact any decisions it made would have on Australian farmers.

'We take very seriously our responsibility to ensure that the animals in our supply chain are properly cared for,' she said.

'All of our animal health and welfare standards meet or exceed all Australian requirements.'
