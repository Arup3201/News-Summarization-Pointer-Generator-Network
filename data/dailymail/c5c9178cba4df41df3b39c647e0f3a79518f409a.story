Declan Lloyd, 21, pictured, tricked his grandmother into helping him pick up money he stole in a bank raid

A grandmother was arrested after her grandson tricked her into giving him a lift to pick up money he stole in a robbery.

Declan Lloyd, 21, asked his 68-year old grandmother to drive him to a suburban cul-de-sac saying he needed to pick up his car.

But as she innocently dropped him off, a team of officers waiting nearby pounced on the pair as Lloyd picked up the money he took in a bank raid from a stolen Peugeot 207.

The shocked grandmother was arrested and quizzed on suspicion of robbery alongside her grandson.

She was later freed without charge when police established she knew nothing about the raid.

Lloyd, from Salford, Greater Manchester was sentenced to four years in jail after he was found guilty of robbery.

The raid occurred at 2.35pm on April 24 last year as a security guard was delivering cash at a Barclays Bank in Peel Green, near Eccles.

Lloyd approached the guard from behind then grabbed the cash box which said to have contained a substantial amount of money.

He then jumped into a stolen Peugeot 207, which he later dumped seven miles away in Radcliffe, before fleeing the area on foot.

Police scrambled the force helicopter to hunt the robber from the air whilst a team of detectives uniformed police and traffic officers carried out a ground search of the local and surrounding areas.

Shortly afterwards officers found the stolen Peugeot, noticed the cashbox inside and lay in wait to see of Lloyd would come back to the scene and pick it up.

Just minutes later at 3pm, Lloyd turned up in his grandmother's car and was seen collecting the cash box and putting it into her vehicle.

A police source said: 'Officers suspected someone would come back for the cash as it was still in the car but they never thought for one minute he would bring his own gran with him.

'Police had to arrest her because she was at the scene of a crime but officers soon realised she had nothing to do with it.

'She was utterly shocked not only at being arrested but also by her grandson's behaviour. It has to take a pretty heartless crook to take their nan with them on a job.'

Lloyd denied robbery but was convicted after a trial at Manchester Crown Court.

No-one was hurt in the raid.

Today Detective Constable Justin Bryant, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Following this robbery we commenced a thorough and comprehensive search for the stolen vehicle and due to the efforts of officers on the ground it was quickly located.

'Due to their endeavours, and partly thanks to Lloyd's dim-wittedness in returning to the scene so quickly, we were able to identify the offender, locate the getaway car and recover the stolen cash in about 30 minutes.

'Lloyd did not think twice about targeting the security guard and even roped his unsuspecting grandmother in to try and get away with this crime but thanks to the efforts of all involved he is now starting a four year prison sentence.'

At the time of the raid, Det Insp Robert Cousen said: 'Thankfully the security worker was not hurt in anyway but has obviously been left shocked that someone stole the cash box in broad daylight.

'He was going about his daily business and it is wrong that he was targeted in such a way.'
