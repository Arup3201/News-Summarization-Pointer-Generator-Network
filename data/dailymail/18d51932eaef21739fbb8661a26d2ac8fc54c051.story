Court action: Mr Price and his wife Catherine told Reading Magistrates' Court the noise of excited children screaming was disturbing them

A former chief pilot of Concorde who made a legal bid to silence 'loud' children playing near his millionaire home has had his private prosecution thrown out.

Roger Price and his wife became involved in a bitter neighbourhood dispute over noise from a nearby playground which saw them sue the parish council for 'making their lives a misery'.

The retired British Airways pilot told a district judge that shrieking children enjoying play facilities erected on a recreation ground next to his million pounds home in Ascot, Berkshire, had spoilt his enjoyment of the upmarket neighbourhood.

But despite the former pilot's protestations, District Judge Andrew Vickers threw out the couple's private prosecution today under the Environment Protection Act.

Today the wealthy former pilot's woes were compounded when they were asked to pay legal costs of £50,000, before being angrily confronted outside Reading Magistrates Court by banner-waving neighbours calling for their park to be saved.

The former pilot claimed the play area – built around 20 yards from his detached house in Ascot, Berkshire – is ‘severely disrupting’ his life.

He and his wife, Dr Catherine Bentley-Thomas, 51, fought a private prosecution to try to force Winkfield Parish Council to shut it.

The local council spent £150,000 adding play equipment to the village recreation field in May last year, but Mr Price said the park was attracting children from outside the area who are too loud.

A total of 13 residents launched the court bid against Winkfield Parish Council, including Sky TV sports presenter Chris Skudder, who also lives near the playground.

Mr and Mrs Price now have just 12 weeks to decide whether they want to appeal the decision.

'We are disappointed,' said the 67-year-old as he left Reading Magistrates’ Court.

'We don’t really see how anyone who listened to all the evidence could think that 250 kids screaming not far from your front garden is not likely to be a noise nuisance. But that is his decision and we accept it.'

Earlier this month at Reading Magistrates’ Court he said: ‘The type of noise we have experienced is that of small children screaming and shrieking with excitement.’

He told the court the ‘unpredictable high frequency shrieks’ and the sound of parents calling their children were distracting.

‘My normal life and my ability to enjoy my home and surroundings have been severely disrupted,’ he said.

The action is in the name of his wife, a GP. She told the court that the park attracts hundreds of children and parents in the summer but the sound of just one grandfather pushing a child on the swings had been enough to disturb her.

She provided the court with readings taken by a sound consultant that showed the average noise in her garden over a 45-minute period on one afternoon was 57.1 decibels, with peaks of up to 77 decibels from children’s shouts.

Mr Price, who worked as a British Airways pilot for 32 years, and his wife have been backed by Sky News sports presenter Chris Skudder, whose house also borders the field.

Mr Skudder, who lives with his wife and two children, said the playground had created a ‘living hell’.

The residents were accused by barrister for the council Katie Helmore of not wanting ‘children from less affluent areas infiltrating their community’.

She pointed to complaints from the residents which included that the park was ‘full of really fat women from Bracknell’ who could not control their children.

Other residents, whose homes back on to the park, told the court they supported the playground, which includes water fountains, a sandpit, zipwire and swings.

Father of two Alan Weyman said it was a good place to socialise with other parents and it was ‘nice to hear children enjoying themselves’.

Chairman of Winkfield Parish Council, Alan Kendall, said after the verdict: 'The council is very pleased with the outcome and hopes the playground can continue to be enjoyed by all of those who have shown support which the council is very grateful for.

'Winkfield Parish Council remains committed to providing first class facilities.'
