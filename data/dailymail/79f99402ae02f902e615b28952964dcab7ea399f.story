A widow aged 83 died after the microwaveable wheat bag she was using to heat her bed set her home alight.

Great-grandmother Norma Hickey was asleep when the warmer – described as the ‘modern-day water bottle’ – overheated and started smouldering under her bed linen.

Fire crews called to the blaze in Wallasey Village, on the Wirral, found her dead in her first-floor bedroom.

Norma Hickey, 83, died after the wheat bag she was using to warm her bed caught fire while she slept

She is believed to be the first person to die after using one of the bags in bed while sleeping. But five other people are known to have lost their lives as a result of fires caused by the warmers, which are made of cloth and filled with grains of wheat, flaxseed or corn.

Last night her distraught daughter, Suzanne Healey, 59, told the Daily Mail she had no idea wheat bags could be a fire hazard.

‘I can’t believe something this small has caused such devastation,’ she said.

‘My mother had memory problems, so I did everything I could to keep her safe. I used to take all her meals round to the house as I was afraid that if she used the gas oven she’d forget to turn it off.

'I left notes on the cooker to remind her how to turn it on and off.

‘I really thought I’d covered all bases. I just wish I’d known these wheat bags could be so dangerous.’

The bags, which can be used hot or cold, are popular among the elderly who find they ease arthritis and muscular ailments.

Paul Murphy, group manager  at Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, said it appeared Mrs Hickey accidentally microwaved the bag for too long, causing it to smoulder when she took it to bed last Sunday.

Neighbours called 999 after hearing smoke alarms at around 4.30am. Firemen with breathing apparatus were sent into the property.

Mr Murphy added: ‘We think that the wheat bag has possibly been overheated and left within a bed, and this has caused a smouldering, smothering effect as the quilt on top of the wheat bag has caused it to continue to generate heat.

The great-grandmother, who suffered from memory loss, is thought to be the first person to be killed by one of the bags while sleeping

Norma's daughter, Suzanne Healey, said she had no idea the bags could be a fire hazard

‘It’s an awful situation and our condolences go out to the family.’

He said wheat bags must be handled with care, adding: ‘A product that absorbs and stores heat in this way is a potential fire risk if not used properly.’

Mrs Hickey was an administrator at a hospital until her retirement. Her husband John, a technician who suffered from Alzheimer’s, died 13 years ago, aged 79. The couple had two children.

Mrs Healey, a mother of two who runs a tiling business, said: ‘My mother was a world traveller and was very active right up until her health began to falter.

‘She was such a gregarious and outgoing woman who was loved by so many people. She was particularly close to my sons and adored her three great-grandchildren.’

She added: ‘I hope people realise just how dangerous these microwaveable bags can be.

‘Anyone can buy them from a shop and even if they overheat just a little they can cause such devastation.’

Burned: Fire damage can be seen on the outside of Norma's bedroom windows where the blaze started

Norma's daughter says she took every precaution with her frail mother, but did not know the bags were a hazard

Fire crews have visited more than 260 properties and carried out 78 home fire safety checks around Wallasey this week following the blaze.

‘We are urging people to check on elderly neighbours in their area,’ Mr Murphy added. ‘We also ask relatives to help check the smoke alarms in older people’s homes and to make sure they have smoke alarms on each level.’

In 2010, Josephine Lloyd died after a wheat bag caught fire in her microwave in Manchester. It was thought the 79-year-old widow, who suffered from Alzheimer’s, may have added an extra zero to the heating time.

West Yorkshire fire service also warned people to be careful with the bags after 82-year-old Doreen Ghiloni died when one overheated and caused a fire in her Leeds home in May 2008.
