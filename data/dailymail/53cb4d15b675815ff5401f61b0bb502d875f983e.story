There were worrying scenes for the visitors and Germany, however, as international midfielder Marco Reus trudged off after picking up knock. The diagnosis was unclear.

Elsewhere, Hamburg, the Bundesliga's only ever-present club, escaped direct relegation by the skin of their teeth after a 3-2 defeat at Mainz 05 sent them into a two-leg playoff against a team from the second division.
