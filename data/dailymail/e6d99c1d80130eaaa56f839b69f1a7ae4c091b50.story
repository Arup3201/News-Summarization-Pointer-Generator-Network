Older people are more fearful of developing dementia than they are of cancer, a new poll suggests.

Two thirds of people over the age of 50 fear that they will develop the condition while just one in 10 said they were frightened about getting cancer.

When 500 adults aged over 50 from across the UK were asked which condition they feared the most, 68% said dementia and 9.44% said cancer.

Meanwhile just 3.88% said they were frightened about getting a heart condition and 0.73% were concerned about developing diabetes.

There are around 800,000 people with dementia in the UK but as the population ages this figure is expected to soar in coming years.

Symptoms can include memory loss and difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language. It occurs when the brain is damaged by diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or a series of strokes.

'As an increasing number of people are diagnosed with dementia more people are seeing the profound impact that it can have on both the individual as well as the wider family,' said Paul Green, director of communications at over-50s company Saga, which conducted the survey.

'However whilst these fears are completely understandable, it's important that education around the condition is enhanced to give a greater understanding of the benefits of early diagnosis - and how this can help those living with the condition continue to lead fulfilling lives.'

Commenting on the poll Hilary Evans, director of external affairs at charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'It's no surprise to learn that fear of dementia in people over 50 is high: dementia affects over 820,000 people in the UK and we currently lack treatments to tackle the condition.

'The challenge is to find new ways to treat and prevent dementia to show there is hope of taking on dementia and beating it. Research holds the answer to this devastating condition and with the number of people affected set to grow as the population ages, the need for investment in research has never been more urgent.'

Alison Cook, the director of external affairs at the Alzheimer's Society charity, added: 'The possibility of losing the very essence of what makes you the individual that you are is a frightening prospect.

'But fear can mean people don't get a diagnosis and can often miss the opportunity to access treatments (which are only effective for people in the earlier stages of the condition) and the time to make important decisions about their future. We urge anyone concerned about dementia to speak to their GP and get in touch with Alzheimer's Society as there are lots of ways we can help.'
