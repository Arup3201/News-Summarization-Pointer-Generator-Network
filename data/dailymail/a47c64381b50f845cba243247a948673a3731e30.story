Unless you count grey,  the May Day bank holiday offered little in the way of colour.

But these spectacular azaleas did at least brighten up one girl’s afternoon during a miserable, dank weekend.

Lily Manning, eight, made her way through the colourful display at Exbury Gardens in the New Forest, Hampshire, as the rest of the country sheltered under umbrellas.

Heavy rain across large parts of Britain and below-average temperatures have led some to speculate that we are on course for the coldest start to May in 70 years. And few who did venture out yesterday would dare to disagree.

As temperatures failed to get anywhere near the 16c (61f) average for this time of year, the beach resorts of Brighton and Bournemouth were all but deserted.

One Bournemouth tourist, Sarah Slade, 38, from Milton Keynes, said: ‘When I booked a mini-break at the seaside for the May bank holiday I had hoped to pack my bikini and suntan lotion. Instead I’ve had to dig out some of my winter clothing. It feels like February, not May.’

Tesco said that umbrella sales were up by 2,580 per cent from this time last year – when the skies were blue and the heat rivalled anything in the Mediterranean – while sales of wellington boots rose by 256 per cent.

‘This time last year we were out in our gardens enjoying barbecue food but the miserable weather has had shoppers stocking up on the kind of food they would normally buy in mid-winter,’ said Karen Poole, a manager at the supermarket.

The total cost of the weekend wash-out to Britain’s tourism industry is yet to be calculated, but is expected to run into tens of millions of pounds.

Visitor numbers to the Thomas Cook website have soared by 27 per cent in a week, as Britons look for warmer weather abroad.

Temperatures
dipped to a freezing -5C (23F) in Scotland yesterday morning and it was 
several degrees colder in the North than would be expected for this time
of year.

After an 
unusually mild festive season, which saw many areas reaching the low 
teens, Spring has been a wash-out across most of Britain so far.

Many
families have been hitting travel agent websites to book continental 
holidays on the Queen's Jubilee, rather than enduring another miserable 
bank holiday.

Although the 
roads were mostly empty this weekend, a few hardy Brits braved the 
weather to frolic at the icy seaside - just as the toughest swimmers normally
do in the depths of winter.

The coastal scenes were little changed from December, when temperatures did not fall below 8 or 9C (46-48F) on Christmas Day.

The mercury could plummet by as 
much as 11 degrees below the month’s average of 16C (61F) today, with frost and even snow expected in some parts of Scotland.

Manchester
is likely to see highs of 11C (52F), where the usual average for May 
Day is around 13C (55F), according to the Met Office.

'It has been colder than usual over the weekend, and still is in the North,' said a spokesman.

'There
is better news for London and the South East however. Temperatures have
improved after a chilly weekend, and could reach the mid-teens today.'

Unlike the pleasant sunshine and gentle 
breezes of a year ago, heavy downpours transformed this May Day
into a grey and instantly forgettable affair.

Traffic experts said the road were quieter than usual as families opted against day trips to the British seaside.

Travel agents have revealed there has been a
surge in holiday bookings ahead of the Jubilee weekend as Britons have determined not to endure another miserable bank holiday.

Shoppers have been snapping up jumpers
and wellington boots over the bank holiday, rather than rushing out for
sunglasses and barbecues.

Tesco
said sales of umbrellas were up 2,580 per cent from last year, and 
those of wellies were up 256 per cent, according to The Times.

Comfort food has also remained 
unusually popular for this time of year, with fresh soup sales up by 150
per cent, and hot chocolate 26 per cent.

At Asda, sales of men's jumpers leapt 95 per cent compared with the beginning of May last year.

cracked road in Suffolk collapsed into a 15ft-deep crevasse after 
torrential rain, with residents comparing the scene to the aftermath of

Furious locals in Felixstowe said they had warned of the seriousness of the problem eight years ago.

The
old crack suddenly opened up after weeks of heavy downpours as the road
crashed down an embankment. The route is now impassable unless drivers 
mount the pavement.

Many people living in bungalows on the close, owned by Flagship Housing, suffer from disabilities.

Jocelyn Foreman, who lives on the street, said: 'It looks like we've been hit by an earthquake.

'We have been fighting to get this repaired and this could have been avoided if the work had been done.'

The homes overlook Peewit Caravan Park, on land below, which has also suffered from the catastrophic landslip.

Pipes feeding a drainage pond at the top have broken, sending a cascade of water through the soil onto the site.

Liz Smith, of Peewit, said water was 
careering over the park's new bowls green.

She said: 'We have 34 
privately-owned caravans in that area and we are having to tell the 
owners to bring their wellies to reach them.'

Emma King, Flagship's customer 
services director, said: 'Our first priority has been to get on site 
with our customers to limit inconvenience.

'There
have been longstanding problems with this road and the recent heavy 
rainfall is likely to have had an impact on the condition too.

'We acknowledge the frustration felt by local residents and will continue to work with them to try and make life easier.'

After the 
wettest April since records began in 1910, there seems to be no end to the gloom in sight.

By Thursday, as much as 1.5in of rain is expected across parts of the 
country, causing localised flooding.

A
Met Office spokesman said: ‘A deepening depression to the south west of
the country will engage with warm, humid air over northern France to 
bring a spell of heavy and persistent rain from late on Wednesday night.

‘Due
to the saturated nature of the ground this may well lead to some 
disruption from localised surface water flooding during Thursday.

'As the
low deepens, strong winds may increase to gale force, especially near 
the south coast.’

In London yesterday the mercury hit 
just 9C (48F), while in Leeming, North Yorkshire, it plummeted as low as
-3C (27F). Temperatures are expected to remain below the 16C (61F) average 
until the end of the week – as the heaviest of the rain arrives.

The
flood warnings come days after Harry McCabe, 54, from Basingstoke, 
Hampshire, slipped and fell 160ft to his death during a cliff-top walk 
with his wife Samantha, their 12-year-old daughter Faye and her friend.

Investigations
will examine whether recent heavy rain may have played a part in the 
tragedy at Mullion Cove in Cornwall, where the family was on holiday.

Meanwhile, police searching for 
eight-year-old Ian Bell, who disappeared after falling into the swollen 
River Wear on April 27, have found the body of a young boy.

Durham Police said the discovery was made downstream from Page Bank Bridge near Willington, County Durham.

'It's been pretty cold,' said forecaster Nick Prebble of MeteoGroup yesterday.

'We've
seen flurries of snow over the Grampians and north-west Highlands, and 
there's been sleet there, too. There have also been a few light sleet 
showers in northern England.'

More snow flurries are forecast over high ground in Scotland.

Four
flood warnings remain in place and the Environment Agency said that 
while water levels were receding, officials were continuing to monitor the situation.
