As scientists mark the 45th year since the Apollo 11 lunar landing, a lesser known anniversary last week quietly passed the world by.

Almost one hundred years ago today, Massachusetts-born Robert Hutchings Goddard received a revolutionary patent for a liquid-fuelled rocket.

The patent, which was ridiculed by journalists at the time, paved the way for the Apollo moon landings and helped bring about the dawn of the ‘space age’.

Dr Robert Goddard was advocated exploring space with rockets, for which he was ridiculed, which turned Goddard into something of a recluse

Dr Robert Hutchings Goddard - today considered the father of modern rocket propulsion – was a modest man who went largely unrecognised for his early work.

He first caught the attention of academics as a student in 1907 after a cloud of smoke from a powder rocket fired in the basement of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute physics building. 

In 1914, Goddard received two U.S. patents. One was for a rocket using liquid fuel. The other was for a two- or three-stage rocket using solid fuel.

Dr Goddard’s liquid-fuelled rocket, patented July 14, 1914. By 1916, he had developed the mathematical theories of rocket propulsion

By 1916, he had developed the mathematical theories of rocket propulsion.

Toward the end of a 1920 report, Dr Goddard outlined the possibility of a rocket reaching the moon and exploding a load of flash powder there to mark its arrival.

The media picked up Goddard’s scientific proposal about a rocket flight to the moon, however, and created a journalistic controversy concerning the feasibility of such a thing.

Corey Powell, writing for the Discover blog, notes that The New York Times ridiculed his ideas about rocketry at the time.

They said, his claim that a rocket could fly in the vacuum of space would ‘deny a fundamental law of dynamics, and only Dr Einstein and his chosen dozen, so few and fit, are licensed to do that.'

However, by 1926, Dr Goddard had constructed and successfully tested the first rocket using liquid fuel based on these patents.

For astronomers, the flight of Dr Goddard’s rocket on March 16, 1926, at Auburn, Massachusetts, was as significant to history as that of the Wright brother’s first flight.

As Apollo 11 was racing moonward, the New York Times published a correction: 'Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.

As Dr Goddard once said: ‘It is difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.’
