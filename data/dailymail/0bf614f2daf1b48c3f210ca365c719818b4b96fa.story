It is better known for being aligned with the rising and setting of the sun but Stonehenge has been transformed into something a lot more fiery.

As the sun set last night, the World Heritage site was illuminated with fire sculptures and candle-lit paths to mark the London 2012 Olympic Games.

The Fire Garden has transformed the ancient site into a 'glowing fairytale environment' with 'mysterious 
fiery engines', flaming fire pots and 'cascades of candles'.

Dramatic: Fires light up the ancient stones at Stonehenge near Salisbury, Wiltshire as French artists Compagnie Carabosse present Fire Garden for the Salisbury International Arts Festival

Organised by the Salisbury 
International Arts Festival, the Wiltshire-based attraction, which runs for three
 consecutive nights, has been created by French arts group Compagnie 
Carabosse as part of the London 2012 Festival.

The arts group, which has staged installations across Europe, said 
visitors would 'pass between concentric circles of flames' and 'huge 
fire balls'.

Festival director Maria Bota said: 'We aim to inspire, entertain and make moments which transform people and spaces.

Ancient monument: Stonehenge was constructed boulder by boulder around 4,500 to 5,000 years ago

Inspiration: Festival director Maria Bota said the aim is to 'inspire, entertain and make moments which transform people and spaces'

Maria Bota said: 'Our thanks to the remarkable Compagnie Carabosse for their continued collaboration and to London 2012 for enabling us to bring this idea to flickering life'

'Our thanks to the remarkable 
Compagnie Carabosse for their beautiful fire garden creations, to 
English Heritage, with whom we have worked for many years at Stonehenge,
 for their continued collaboration and to London 2012 for enabling us to
 bring this idea to flickering life.'

Scientists published new research last month that claimed Stonehenge was built to cement a new East
 West alliance between the former warring tribes of Britain as the 
country started to become a United Kingdom after centuries of strife some 5,000-4,500 years ago.

Important: Stonehenge had special significance for prehistoric Britons because its solstice-aligned Avenue sits upon a series of natural landforms that, by chance, form an axis between the directions of midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset

They rejected notions that the monument was prehistoric observatory, a sun temple, a place of healing, or a temple of the ancient druids.

Instead they said it symbolised the ancestors of the various 
clans inhabiting the area - early farming families - towards the end of the Stone Age, which
 had been marked by conflict and religious differences.
