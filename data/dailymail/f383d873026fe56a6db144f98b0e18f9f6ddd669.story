The decline of Steven Gerrard

The saddest sight of all was seeing Gerrard, a great England player, stranded in midfield and exposed. Either the system had to be modified to give him more support or Hodgson should have taken the harder decision to substitute him.

The hole in midfield

Hodgson complained that he didn't have too many experienced players which is why he invested so much in Gerrard - but it seemed one tournament too many.   Hodgson seemed to believe the attacking football hype and that England had enough to overwhelm the opposition. Yet there were gaps between the holding midfielders and the front four. A 4-3-3 with an extra midfielder, Ross Barkley or Jack Wilshere, would have been more conservative but restored the balance and supported Gerrard better.

Absence of Ashley Cole

There was a logic to excluding Cole: England were going to play on the front foot, with full backs pushing on. Glen Johnson's cross for Rooney's goal was a perfect example - and it worked in patches. There were doubts that Cole could still do that. But full backs still need to defend. Leighton Baines was a threat going forward but he turned into a liability defensively.

Lack of a game management

Hodgson has a reputation as a coaches' coach and is fascinated by tactics and how the game develops. Yet there seemed to be very little reaction to key problems. Uruguay had a clear plan for Lodeiro and Cavani to crowd Gerrard and make life uncomfortable for Jagielka and Cahill when they were in possession. England could have changed Gerrard's position to make Uruguay consider whether they really wanted to detail two players to crowd him - or change the system. Instead England stayed as they were and Gerrard was played out of the game.

Hodgson's high risk strategy

The irony is that had Hodgson set up a team as he did at Euro 2012 - cautiously and ensuring they exceeded the sum of their parts - he would have been vilified and England would likely have two points. Almost everyone embraced the new model England. Yet England seemed to have one setting, which was all-out attack. If England are to improve in tournament football they will need to fuse the old model with the new one to create a better balance.
