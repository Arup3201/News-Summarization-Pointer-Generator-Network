Searching for a medieval king who had been lost for 527 years always looked like a long shot.

In a discovery worthy of a Hollywood film, however, archaeologists yesterday announced they had unearthed what appear to be the remains of Richard III.

Using historic maps, they traced a friary where he was rumoured to have been buried after being killed in battle – underneath a social services department car park in Leicester.

And after only three weeks of digging,
 to their astonishment they found the skeleton of an adult male who was 
well-built and clearly of noble descent.

His injuries – a metal arrowhead 
embedded in his back, and a severe blow to the head – are consistent 
with the king's death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.

Even more persuasive is the fact that the man has a severely curved spine; Richard was famously nicknamed Crookback.

The revelation that the skeleton, 
exhumed on September 4, had severe scoliosis provoked a gasp at the 
packed press conference in Leicester's Tudor-era Guildhall building 
yesterday.

He was not a hunchback, the 
archaeologists said, but his right shoulder was higher than his left – 
consistent with accounts of Richard's appearance.

As any scholar of Shakespeare will 
know, the king was famously ridiculed as a hunchback in the Bard's play,
 described as 'rudely stamp'd, deformed, unfinish'd'.

Experts stress that the remains must 
be subjected to rigorous DNA testing, to be undertaken over the next 
three months, to be sure if it is him. But they say the discovery is a 
potentially 'historic moment'.

Richard Taylor, of Leicester University, said: 'This search has at times resembled a Dan Brown novel in its twists and turns.

'We have all been witness to a powerful and historic story unfolding before our eyes.'

Richard III, the last monarch of the 
Plantagenet family, ruled for only two years before dying in battle in 
1485 when he was 32.

It marked the end of the Wars of the Roses and the victory of Henry Tudor, the first of the new dynasty.

Under the new regime, Richard was 
portrayed as a hunchback and a power-mad child-killer said to have 
slaughtered his two young nephews to seize the throne.

Archaeologists have found a skeleton they believe could be the remains of King Richard III, the tyrant king. It has an arrow in its back and a curved spine, a condition believed to have affected the monarch.

Historians say that the find could 
help settle a five-century-long controversy over whether the king was 
the villain of legend, or a victim of malicious propaganda.

Richard III was thought to be buried 
at Grey Friars, a Franciscan friary destroyed during Henry VIII's 
Dissolution of the Monasteries, but it was later claimed his body was 
thrown into a river.

In the early 1600s the site of Grey 
Friars was bought by the mayor of Leicester, Alderman Robert Herrick, 
and used as his garden.

In 1612 Christopher Wren, father of 
the famous architect, recorded seeing a 3ft stone pillar in the garden 
inscribed: 'Here lies the body of Richard III, sometime King of 
England.'

The site was bought by Leicester City Council in 1914.

Lead archaeologist Richard Buckley 
said: 'We were very lucky it was a car park, and the remains, at the 
entrance to the choir, were just under the trench we dug, when there 
were several buildings at the friary.

'He's a prime candidate. I'd be very surprised if someone else was buried at this same spot with critical injuries.'

The university intends for the body, if it is proven to be Richard, to be buried in the city's cathedral.

As for the social workers, the academics said, it will be 'quite some time' before they get their car park back.

The Battle of Bosworth Field was 
fought on the morning of August 22, 1485, and marked the end of the War 
Of The  Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and 
Lancaster.

One of the 
most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard 
III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best 
known quotations.

The leading role has been played by Laurence Olivier and Sir Ian McKellen, and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks.

The battle marked the final 
confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger 
Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster.

The seeds of Richard's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12-year-old nephew Edward V in 1483.

Support
 for the monarch was further diminished when Edward and his younger 
brother disappeared and Richard was involved in the death of his wife. 
Henry laid claim to the throne from across the Channel.

Following
 an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, 
Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485.

Gathering
 support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and 
intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire.

After
 Richard's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned King Henry VII
 and became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted
 until 1603.
