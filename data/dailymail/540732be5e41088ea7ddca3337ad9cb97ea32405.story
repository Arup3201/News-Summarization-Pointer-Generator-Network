A council has been slammed for spending a staggering £1,000 to translate one tenancy agreement into Urdu.

Crawley Borough Council splashed the cash to translate the agreement between one tenant and the council, saying Urdu was 'more expensive to translate' than other languages.

The council was criticised in 2012 after spending £628 translating its 12-page quarterly magazine Homelink into Urdu after just one tenant called to complain they couldn't read it.

A council spent £1,000 translating a single document into Urdu and, while it is an incredibly complicated language, drew criticism for spending so much on one translation

In the past two years it has spent a total of £4,111 translating just 15 documents, including £1,000 for the Urdu translation - paid to Integro Languages - and £526 to translate a tenancy agreement into Russian.

Other tenancy agreements included £659 for one to be translated into French and £668 for one to be translated into Portuguese.

The council also forked out £30 to translate a health and safety sign at a communal laundry room in a council block into Punjabi and £25 to translate a nuisance behaviour letter to a French-speaking resident.

Crawley MP Henry Smith this week slammed the payments, telling his local paper the Crawley News: 'The only time tat translations really are justifiable at that expense is when a large number of people will benefit from it.

'Individual translations which cost that amount are not appropriate (and) I'm concerned it appears as though the council is pursuing that sort of approach.'

Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, says councils should cut back spending on needless translations

The chair of Ukip in Crawley, Lee Gilroy said the payments were 'a joke', adding: "Is that person paying council tax? Is that person working and contributing to the town?

'I just fee that so many people are struggling to pay their council tax will read this and see where their money is going - and be absolutely outraged.'

The council was slammed in 2012 after it was revealed it stumped up £628 to translate it's Homelink magazine into Urdu, with Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, saying councils should cut back spending on needless translations.

He said at the time: 'Some local authorities translate a range of documents into languages spoken by their residents, and provide interpretation services.

'While there may be rare occasions in which this is entirely necessary - for instance in emergency situations - I am concerned such services are in many cases being provided unnecessarily.

'Such translation services have an unintentional, adverse impact on integration by reducing the incentive for some migrant communities to learn English.

'I understand in Crawley a single person complained.

'The gentleman concerned would be well advised to learn English and become an integrated citizen.'

Local Richard Reeves, 43, said: 'I could understand it if it was a for a large number of people, but for just one person £1,000 is totally unacceptable.

'It really sticks in my throat that the council tax we all pay is being wasted on needless things like this when the money could be better spent to the benefit of all.'

A spokesman of the Tory-run council said tenancy agreements were 'important legal documents', adding: 'Translations are usually provided to meet legal and safety obligations as wet are required to demonstrate that reasonable steps have been taken to ensure the information has been communicated in ways the tenant can understand.

'We don't automatically provide translations and all request are carefully vetted by a council officer.'

She also said translating documents into Urdu was more expensive that other languages.

Band D council taxpayers in Crawley pay £1,488 a year.

Urdu is a language spoken by more than 400m people worldwide, with the majority of native speakers coming form India or Pakistan.
