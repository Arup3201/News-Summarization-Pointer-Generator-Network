Girlguiding UK is supporting a petition to abolish The Sun newspaper's long-running topless model feature on page three.

After Rupert Murdoch hinted he might be ending the slot, girl guide members aged 16 to 25 voted overwhelmingly to sign the the 'No More Page 3' campaign, with 88 per cent of respondents agreeing the paper should call time on the provocative editorial that has been running since 1970.

The campaign itself - which has already accrued some 90,000 signatures - was launched during the London Olympics last summer, when writer Lucy Anne Holmes noticed that the largest 
female image in The Sun was of a young woman showing her breasts, even 
though heptathlete Jessica Ennis had just won her gold medal.

Tops on, please: Girlguiding UK has given its support to the No More Page 3 campaign, asking The Sun to call time on its topless model feature

The decision to hold a vote on the 
campaign was taken by Girlguiding's Advocates - our panel of young women
aged between 14 and 25 who are the driving force behind Girlguiding's 
advocacy work.

Explaining their decision to support the 
campaign, the Girlguiding Advocates said: 'The Sun is a family 
newspaper. Anyone can pick it up, turn to Page 3, and think that it is 
normal for young women to be treated as objects. This is just wrong.

'It
is impossible to nurture your ambitions if you are constantly told that
you aren't the same as your male equivalent. It is disrespectful and 
embarrassing. We need to get used to the idea that women are not for 
sale.'

The guides said: 'The Sun is a family newspaper. Anyone can pick it up, turn to Page 3, and think that it is normal for young women to be treated as objects. This is just wrong'

Campaign pressure: Lucy Holmes, the writer behind No More Page 3, poses in her campaign T-shirt, left, and Rupert Murdoch's suggestive tweet that he is considering ending the feature, right

The organisation added: 'Girlguiding believes passionately in 
giving girls a voice on issues that they care about. We would like all 
our young members to have the opportunity to speak out publicly and to 
add their voices to campaigns affecting the lives of girls.'

Take The Bare Boobs Out Of The Sun

We are asking Dominic Mohan to drop the bare boobs from The Sun newspaper.

We are asking very nicely.

Please, Dominic.

No More Page 3.

George Alagiah doesn't say, 'And now let's look at Courtney, 21, from Warrington's bare breasts,' in the middle of the 6 O' Clock News, does he, Dominic?

Philip and Holly don't flash up pictures of Danni, 19, from Plymouth, in just her pants and a necklace, on This Morning, do they, Dominic?

No, they don't.

There would be an outcry.

And you shouldn't show the naked breasts of young women in your widely read 'family' newspaper either.

Consider this a long overdue outcry.

Dominic, stop showing topless pictures of young women in Britain's most widely read newspaper, stop conditioning your readers to view women as sex objects.

Enough is enough.

Thank you.

The campaign commented: 'No More Page 3 are absolutely thrilled that the Girlguiding's young members have voted to support our campaign to bring an end to the most iconic piece of sexism in our national press.

'We have heard too many stories of how Page 3 negatively impacts young women and girls; either because of boys' reactions to it or girls' own feelings about their bodies and self-worth caused by being presented with such narrow definitions of beauty on a daily basis.

'As we have at least one former guiding member within the team, we know firsthand what a powerful and positive influence guiding can have on individual girls.'

Murdoch, chief executive of News Corporation who own The Sun, suggested abolishiing Page 3 in an off-the-cuff remark on Twitter.

The Australian media mogul responded to a tweet about ditching the feature, saying: 'Page three so last century! You maybe right, don't know but considering. Perhaps halfway house with glamorous fashionistas.'

Writing in the Independent,
Holmes, who was sexually assaulted in her 20s, explained her reasons 
for launching the petition: 'As one of our change.org petition 
signatures says, "Boobs aren't news". Indeed, so why are they in the 
newspaper?

'Well, they are in the newspaper 
because in 1970 a group of men, in a male managed media, in a male run 
country decided to put them there.

'Possibly they didn't think how women 
would feel about being represented like this, nor did it occur to them 
that women read newspapers.

'The page 3 girl image is there for 
no other reason than the sexual gratification of men. She’s a sex 
object.

'But when figures range from 300,000 women being sexually 
assaulted and 60,000 raped each year, to 1 in 4 who have been sexually 
assaulted, is it wise to be repeatedly perpetuating a notion that women 
are sexual objects?'
