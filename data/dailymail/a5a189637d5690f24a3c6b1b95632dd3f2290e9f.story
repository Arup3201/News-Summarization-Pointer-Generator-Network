Suicide notes were found with the bodies of a couple who took their own lives last week, police sources said.

Lynne Rosen, 46, and John Littig, 48, who worked as 'happiness gurus' and motivational speakers, allegedly left two notes at their home in Brooklyn, New York.

Mr Littig's note said that the couple 'were going to do this together' amid reports that Ms Rosen had suffered from psychological problems, according to the New York Daily News.

The NYPD could not confirm the details to MailOnline.

It is believed that the bodies had been lying for a week in the Park Slope apartment before they were found.

The supervisor of the building kicked in the door after noticing a foul odor.

They hosted a monthly radio show together called 'The Pursuit of Happiness' on WBAI-FM.

On their radio show, Ms Rosen, a psychotherapist, and her long-term partner Mr Littig would offer advice to listeners on becoming their 'true self'.

Ms Rosen, who was also a life coach and consultant, had presented the show for six years.

In the February installment of their show, the couple discussed the importance of doing something that scares you every day, advice that was taken from their Why Not Now Life coaching program.

Mr Littig, a life coach and motivational
speaker, was also a musician, performing under the name Jadex.

He 
recently performed and produced the Naked Sounds concern at Webster Hall
in Manhattan. 

The main page of Ms Rosen's business website displays a quotation from author Norman Vincent Peale: 'It's always too early to quit.'

One neighbor of the couple, who had lived in the building for 20 years, told the Daily News that they were 'always respectable'.

However the elderly man added that while Mr Littig was an 'exceptionally nice person', Ms Rosen could be a 'cold fish'.

The couple's tragic deaths also raises questions as to how their bodies could have lay undetected in their apartment for a week. Apartments in the building have been estimated at $900,000.

Park Slope is an affluent area of Brooklyn popular with young families and professionals.
