Stansted airport is to be sold off after its owner BAA gave up on its long legal battle today.

The Spanish company, which recently lost a Court of Appeal ruling over the Essex airport, said it would not make a further appeal and accepts it has to sell it.

The Competition Commission (CC) ruled that BAA must dispose of Gatwick, Stansted and one of its Scottish airports following an inquiry into the companyâ€™s airport ownership.

But BAA had fought it for years saying that Stansted is a completely different operation to Heathrow so it was not breaking competition rules.

'Having carefully considered the Court of Appeal's recent ruling, BAA has decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court and is now proceeding with the sale of Stansted airport,' BAA said in a statement.

But added: 'We still believe that the CC ruling fails to recognise that Stansted and Heathrow serve different markets.'

The BAA decision today ends a process which began as far back as March 2007 when the Office of Fair Trading referred BAA airport services to the Competition Commission.

They then ruled that BAA must sell off Gatwick, Stansted and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh Airports in March 2009.

Gatwick was sold to Global Infrastructure Partnerships (GIP) in December 2009 and GIP also took over Edinburgh Airport last year.

But then BAA mounted a series of legal challenges to the CC ruling, with the latest one - against the sale of Stansted - ending in defeat at the High Court in July this year.

After that latest loss, BAA said it would appeal to the Supreme Court but today the Spanish-owned company signalled an end to its fight to hang on to Stansted.

BAA, which formerly ran seven UK airports, will have responsibility for just four - Heathrow, Southampton, Glasgow and Aberdeen - once the Stansted sale is concluded.
