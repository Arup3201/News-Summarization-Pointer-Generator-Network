There are planes, trains and automobiles as well as homes, airports and mines. And all are eerily quiet.

These are some of the world's strangest places, spots where time appears to have stood still. Once thriving settlements that are now nothing more than ghost towns.

They still stand as monuments to changing economic circumstances, political upheavals, wars gone by and natural or man-made disasters.

Among them is perhaps the most notorious deserted town in recent history, Pripyat in Ukraine.

In April 2006 marked the 20th anniversary of the world's
 worst nuclear disaster, when a reactor at the Chernobyl plant exploded,
 spreading a radioactive cloud across Europe and the Soviet Union.

But as these pictures show, there was no-one there to remember.

Some 50,000 residents from and around Pripyat were evacuated after the 1986 accident. Now, 27 years after the Chernobyl 
disaster, the contaminated zone with the abandoned town of Pripyat has 
become a popular tourist destination for numerous visitors.

To this day in Pripyat there is the remains a fairground with a ferris wheel and bumper car ride that look frozen in time.

Another eerily quiet town is Kolmanskop in Namibia, southern Africa. Here sand dunes have enveloped what was a mining settlement  on the Namibian Diamond Coast.

It was abandoned in the 1950s after the Second World War as diamond prices crashed, and operations moved to Oranjemund.

In Cyprus, deserted houses and 
streets are seen in the town of Varosha, in northern Cyprus. Varosha was
 a popular seaside resort until the Turkish invasion in 1974. It lies 
between the Turkish Cypriot north of the island and the Greek Cypriot 
south.

And in  South Tyro  in Northern Italy sightseers gather where the village of Graun once stood. Now just a church tower can be seen sticking out of the partially frozen Lake Reschen reservoir.

The village was destroyed and the valley flooded in 1950, due to damming up the Etsch river to produce electricity.

Abandoned hotels in Varosha, the Greek Cypriot resort town of Famagusta, remain sealed off to people and settlements despite an easing of checkpoint crossings on the ethnically divided island

In the U.S., perhaps the best known 
abandoned building across the nation stands derelict. The abandoned 
Michigan Central Station is seen in Detroit, Michigan.

The city is a part of America's 
Midwestern 'Rust Belt', the heartland of the country and home to big 
unionised manufacturers like the auto and steel industries.

For years, Michigan Central Station, the
 towering train depot on the outskirts of downtown Detroit, stood as a 
haunting symbol of the city's decline and fall.

The last train pulled 
out of the station in 1988, shortly before the Honda Accord became the 
best-selling car in America, a humbling milestone for the city and its 
top industry.

Continuing the industrial theme, old 
locomotives are seen in a train cemetery in Uyuni, near a salt flat some
 290 miles south of La Paz.

These locomotives and freight cars 
were part of Bolivia's first railway network that carried minerals 
between Uyuni and Antofagasta, Chile, nearly a century ago, according to
 local media.

Rusty steam locomotives are also 
pictured left abandoned at a locomotive graveyard at Thessaloniki, in 
Greece. The hulks include those of an American S160, Austrian 2-10-0 and
 2-8-0, and other 2-8-0 steam locomotives.

In Japan, an aerial view of Battleship Island shows the site of an abandoned coal mining operation in Nagasaki Harbour.

Miners and their families lived on the island in apartment complexes and worked the tunnels underground.

Closer to home, the eerie sight of 
derelict Maunsell Forts in the Thames Estuary can be seen. These were 
small fortified towers built in the Thames and Mersey estuaries built 
during the Second World War to help defend Britain from invasion.

They were named after their designer,
 Guy Maunsell. The forts were decommissioned in the late 1950s and later
 used for other activities.

One became the Principality of 
Sealand; boats visit the remaining forts occasionally, and a consortium 
called Project Redsands is now planning to conserve the fort situated at
 Redsand.
