Liverpool are set to miss out on their number one left back target Alberto Moreno, after they failed to agree a fee with Spanish club Sevilla.

The 21-year-old Europa League winner has been tracked by Brendan Rodgers for some time and although negotiations were lengthy the two have been 'miles apart' on their valuations of the player with the Spaniards looking for Â£20million.

'The matter of Alberto is practically settled. We couldn't reach an agreement and I don't think it can be revived,' Sevilla's Sporting Director Monchi told Spanish newspaper El Correo de Andalucia.

Top target: Moreno was identified as Liverpool's top choice at left back but they failed to agree a fee

'It was great offer but the player is only 21 years old and it's possible that the catharsis of being with the national team had a positive effect.

'He has a lot of room to grow and the coach is very happy to have him.

'I don't think we'll make a lot of moves but if on August 14 a club comes along and they give you a mountain of cash, well....I know you don't like to hear it, but we are economic managers.

'My feeling is that the negotiations are paralysed and I don't see any hint that they will be restarted.

'We put a price on our players which we believe to be appropriate. Whoever wants to buy, can buy, and if you can't....

'Also, with the sale of Ivan Rakitic (to Barcelona) our needs were covered. We don't have the (financial) burden we had at other times.'

Liverpool have already signed Southampton striker Rickie Lambert and Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Emre Can but are looking to strengthen their defence which was a big weakness as they lost out in the Premier League title race.
