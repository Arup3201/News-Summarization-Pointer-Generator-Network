As singers streamed into the studio to record the new Band Aid single, George Osborne announced he has waived VAT on the single.

The move means all of the money raised by the song will go to charity.

Bob Geldof revealed the Chancellor called him this morning to say 'keep the tax'.

He said: 'I spoke to the Chancellor about five minutes ago and he agreed to forgo the VAT on the record.'

'Amazing - that the Government has just said 'fine, keep the tax'.

Chancellor George Osborne took to Twitter to say 'every penny' of the song should go to fight Ebola

'The record, it's a song, it's a track, but it's an event, and the next stage now is to turn this into a phenomenon like it was in the '80s, and the only way to do that is to get people to buy the thing.

'Spare me this free economy. Spare me Spotify and YouTube. There is a donate button on YouTube. Hit the donate button.'

And Mr Osborne took to Twitter to say he had spoken to the 'remarkable' Bob Geldof.

He wrote: 'Just spoke to the remarkable Bob Geldof. Told him we'll waive VAT on #BandAid30 so every penny goes to fight Ebola.'

Geldof welcomed singers including Rita Ora, Ed Sheeran and One Direction to Notting Hill's Sarm Studios to re-record his classic charity track Do They Know It's Christmas? in London today.

The new recording marks the 30th anniversary of the song, which was originally put together to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia , and is expected to raise millions to ease Africa's Ebola crisis. 

The song's lyrics have been reworked to highlight the plight of west Africans affected by the outbreak.
