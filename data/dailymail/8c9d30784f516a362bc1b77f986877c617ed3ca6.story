A couple surprised their friends and family with the ultimate double celebration by inviting them to a christening which became their wedding.

The celebrations turned into wedding joy as the secret Dan Bryars and Lauren Turner had kept for more than six months was revealed.

Since last October the couple, from Hoyland, near Barnsley, South Yorks, secretly planned their wedding but told only their parents and a few close friends.

Surprise! Dan Bryars and Lauren Turner surprised their friends and family by inviting them to a Christening which doubled as their wedding

They got their family and friends together on May 5 at St Peter’s Church, Hoyland, on the pretext of their daughter Poppy’s christening - only revealing that it was a double celebration when Lauren walked up the aisle in her wedding dress.

Lauren, 24, said: 'The guests thought they were attending Poppy’s christening...we told them I was running late as Poppy had been sick on me and when I got to the church, my dad walked me down the aisle.

'People were saying things like "is that all she could find to wear?" and "why are they playing the wedding march?" and then someone shouted "They’re getting married!" and everyone started clapping and screaming.

'There were a few slaps on the arm as we walked out of the church, people couldn’t believe I had done it.

'People say I’m gobby so they were amazed I had kept it a secret. I’m really glad we did it though, it was fantastic.'

Lauren, an administrator, and Dan, a scaffolder, were particularly pleased that Lauren’s grandfather Colin Jones, 71, who died last Saturday, had managed to be part of their special day.

Colin was too ill to make it to the church, but as soon as he found out what had happened he met the happy couple at Elsecar Park where they were having photographs taken.

Following Lauren and Dan’s nuptials, Poppy was christened before the couple and the guests headed to Milton Hall for the evening celebrations.
