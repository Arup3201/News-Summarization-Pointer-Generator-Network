It’s been another interesting week for us at Matchroom Boxing, where we have added Nathan Cleverly to the team. Nathan is a fighter I respect enormously and I can reveal some of the big plans I have for him.

He will be fighting on May 17 in Cardiff and it is my hope to put him out one more time after that before a winter fight with Tony Bellew. That fight is huge and, as it stands, I have pencilled in Liverpool in November. If they both keep winning, then they have a massive fight to look forward to and ultimately a final eliminator to a crack at the cruiserweight world title.

Obviously their first fight, which Nathan won, was in Liverpool, Tony’s backyard, but credit to Nathan who is happy to go there again as it has the most suitable venue. We could do Cardiff again, but the venue there holds 5,000 – this fight is bigger than that. It is a fight built on animosity and rivalry – there is no pretend table flipping. It’s a genuine domestic grudge match.

New arrival: Nathan Cleverly has joined forces with Matchroom ahead of his cruiserweight debut in May

For me, personally, it is great to be working with Nathan. For someone so young – 27 – he has already achieved so much in the sport. Since losing his light-heavyweight world title last year he has taken his time working out what he wants to do in the sport and what is his best way forward.

He is the kind of guy who needs to get excited about the sport again. He wants to feel the buzz, to get exposure and raise his profile and this move has enabled that. It is a new journey for him.

He has come up to cruiserweight and I think that is smart. It is an accessible division. We have a great relationship with the Sauerland promotion team and they have a huge foothold on the cruiserweight division. They have WBO world champion Marco Huck and Yoan Pablo Hernandez, the IBF champion, on their books so we are in a strong position in terms of making those fights down the line and these talks are already taking place.

It is interesting for both Nathan and Tony at the moment. The way I look at it, as a promoter, is that I have two things I have to deliver for my fighter. Number one is to plot the best path to a world title and the other is to deliver the fight that is most lucrative for them. As it happens, the most lucrative and biggest fight for both Nathan and Tony right now is to fight each other.

I could deliver either of them a world title fight tomorrow, but there is no rush. I am happy for both guys to settle into the division first, have two fights each – I will probably look to get Tony out again at the end of June or early July as he hurt his hand in his last fight – and then they can fight each other.

After that, the winner will go after titles.

Same result? Cleverly edged out Bellew three years ago and is prepared to return to Liverpool

At the moment we are still looking at opponents for Nathan on May 17. Tony’s last opponent, Valery Brudov, was sort of a gatekeeper for the elite of the division - a tough test against a good fighter. We will be looking at a similar test for Nathan.

Tony has passed his first test in the division and now Nathan has to do the same. Then we will have something really special to look forward to in the winter.

Fights involving British fighters that don’t like each other definitely sell. At the same time, though, they are ambassadors for their sport and they need to behave. I do have concerns. That is something we will have to deal with closer to the time. I also have concerns about Carl Froch and George Groves being in a room together and as their fight draws closer it’s something we have to plan carefully. That is when you know you have a huge fight because it is all so real.

I think the public sees through fake hype, but the public know how much Tony and Nathan don’t like each other. They just need to make sure they do nothing silly before going in the ring. I’ll make that clear to both fighters – ultimately they are role models and have to be professional.

Fine start: Tony Bellew began his cruiserweight campaign with a stoppage victory over Valery Brudov

Our Cardiff bill on May 17, on which Cleverly features, will be co-headlined by Lee Selby. The Welshman, who is British and Commonwealth featherweight champion, is a real sensation. He is currently ranked No 3 by the WBC, No 6 with the IBF and No 10 by the WBO and No 12 with the WBA. He is going places fast.

I can reveal we are lining up a WBC title eliminator for that May show with Mexican featherweight Romulo Koasicha, who is 21-3. That will hopefully manoeuvre Lee into a WBC world title shot later this year.

One to watch: Welshman Lee Selby is one of the rising stars of British boxing

Over in the States next week is Manny Pacquiao and Timothy Bradley. I feel like Pacquiao is treading water a bit now. One thing that often happens when you miss the big fight that everyone wants, like he has with Floyd Mayweather, sometimes you stop being relevant. That seems to be happening a bit with Pacquiao.

I don’t mean that to sound disrespectful – Pacquiao will never be irrelevant. But his stock has been affected by getting knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez, which followed an unfair points loss against Timothy Bradley. He came back with a win against Brandon Rios but that’s not too much to shout about in the grand scheme of his career.

This Bradley fight is interesting. Pacquiao simply has to win for the sake of his career and he is against a fighter in Bradley who is hugely underrated. Bradley doesn’t get the most recognition because he doesn’t have the biggest personality and he doesn’t carry the hype of his fellow contenders, But he is an extremely dangerous fighter and he is great at adapting in the ring, which is why he is unbeaten in 31.

Tough task: Manny Pacquiao will bid to avenge his controversial defeat to Timothy Bradley on April 12

Doubt: Pacquiao remains convinced he won the first fight with Bradley two years ago

My time: Bradley wants to be Pacquiao again to convince people he deserved the first victory

I actually think Bradley is the favourite going in against Pacquiao. He is the fresher, younger fighter and, unlike Pacquiao, he has never been knocked out. Bradley is not a huge puncher, but he is just too fresh for a great fighter who appears to be sliding.

If Pacquiao does lose, I really don’t think there is a way back for him. If he wins, then let’s all hope that he can finally get it on with Mayweather, albeit for a fraction of the money he would have made if that fight had happened a few years ago.

I’m like all boxing fans in that regard – it was a fight I desperately wanted to see. But you need to fully appreciate how bad the rivalry is between Golden Boy, who promote Mayweather, and Top Rank, who deal with Pacquiao. They seem hell bent on never working together.

We head to York Hall this weekend for the 33rd edition of the Prizefighter series where eight hungry welterweights will battle it out for the £32,000 first prize - you can expect fireworks in this one.

Knockout: The Prizefighter tournament returns to York Hall this Saturday with the welterweights

Prizefighter has been a huge success since its inception in 2008 - it drives the casual viewer into the sport and, in an age of multi-tasking, these fast all action formats continue to strive.

John Ryder will also take on Jez Wilson on the show in an eliminator for another crack at Billy Joe Saunders while popular Londoners Ricky Boylan and Wadi Camacho also feature.

We are all counting down to Froch-Groves II at Wembley on May 31. An application has gone into TFL to take the capacity up to 80,000. I should know more about that this week.

The pressure is building ahead of my attempt at the London Marathon. My dad pulled out his times last night and his first was completed in three hours and 52. He is putting the pressure on. I might be able to squeeze inside four hours but I don’t know about three hours and 52. He was saying his best marathon time was three hours and 22. You have to ask yourself if a taxi was involved. I wouldn’t put it past him.
