Four people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after the body of a woman was found at a home in Richmond, south-west London.

Police were called to an address on Lower Mortlake Road on Saturday after a neighbour raised concerns over a resident's welfare.

The body of a 43-year-old woman was discovered at the scene.
