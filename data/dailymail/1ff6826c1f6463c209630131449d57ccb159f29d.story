Warning: Richard Jones, 41, was told he must complete 'work-related activities' or face having his benefits suspended

A man who lost his leg in an accident has been told he has to get a job just weeks after being told  he was 'fully disabled and unfit for work'.

Richard Jones, from Barrow, Cumbria, has been on benefits since 2000 when he suffered a shattered pelvis, damage to his spinal cord, and reduced use of his right arm.

Then in 2008 he was involved in a biking accident in which he broke his tibia and fibula then two years later had to have his right leg amputated.

In February, the Department for Work and Pensions told him he could keep his benefits.

But this week he has been told he has to complete 'work-related activities' or face having his benefits suspended.

'That
letter from the Department for Work and Pensions dated February 8 says 
I'm fully disabled and unfit for work,' he said, 'so why are they now 
saying just six weeks later that I have to be looking for work when 
clearly I can't?'

The father-of-four said his disabilities - combined with dyslexia that renders him unable to read or write - made him unemployable.

He
said he never knew from one day to the next whether he was able to fit 
his prosthetic leg, be reliant on crutches or even his wheelchair for 
mobility.

'If I could work I
would, but I can't do anything,' he said. 'It's not just me, I know of 
other people that have been struck off.

'There's a man down the road 
who's being struck off now and he's got cerebral palsy and can hardly 
walk, has a crook hand and he's being forced to work.'

Disabilities: He had to have his right leg amputated in 2010 following a motorcycle accident. He was confirmed as 'fully disabled' and 'unfit to work' just six weeks ago

The charity Scope has described the government's Personal Independence Payment reforms as 'fundamentally flawed' and will adversely impact on an estimated 600,000 people nationally.

'In 2013, disabled people are struggling to make ends meet,' Scope chief executive Richard Hawkins said.

'Life costs more if you're disabled. But this year living costs are spiralling and income is flat-lining. Disability Living Allowance needs reforming and could be better targeted to meet the extra costs people face,' he added, 'but disabled people are frightened by the government's plans.

'They believe it's just an excuse to cut their support.'

Tough: Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith has made it tougher to claim disability benefits

A spokesman for the DWP said it does not comment on individual cases.

The latest in a series of radical changes to the welfare system come into effect on April 8 – with most benefits being uprated by just one per cent, below inflation, and disability living allowance (DLA) being replaced with a new personal independence payment (PIP).

Official figures suggest that 71 per cent of those being paid DLA get the benefit 'without systematic checks' and that there has been a sharp increase in parts of Britain, notably the North East and the North West, in the run-up to reform.

Claims for disability benefit had more than doubled in some parts of the country as people scramble to 'get ahead' of the tough new regime.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the surge was an illustration of the need to reform a 'ridiculous' system which has seen the numbers claiming spiral to 3.2 million, at a cost to taxpayers of £13.2 billion.

This is about the same as the entire budget of the Department for Transport.
