A teenage boy racer on drugs was pulled over by police minutes before he killed two teenage best friends, it was revealed today.

Unemployed football coach Samuel Etherington, 21, who is serving a nine year prison sentence, was stopped at 3.25am last November after officers saw a broken rear light on his modified Honda Civic.

But at 4.15am  he crashed into and killed Jasmine Allsop, 14, and Olivia Lewry, 16, while driving 65mph in a 30mph zone.

The speeding driver had taken horse tranquilliser ketamine and mephedrone in the 24 hours before the crash in Gosport, Hampshire.

Crash: Samuel Etherington, 21, who is serving a nine year prison sentence, killed Jasmine Allsop, 14, and Olivia Lewry, 16, last year. Today it emerged police had pulled him over 50 minutes earlier

Tragedy: The best friends were at a party when the dangerous driver knocked them down at 65mph in a 30mph zone

Jasmine's heartbroken mother Rose Allsop, 38, says her daughter would still be alive if the officers who pulled Etherington over had tested him for drugs.

Ms Allsop said: 'If they'd have pulled him over the accident wouldn't have happened in the first place.

'They should have done some kind of test on him.

'They must have known he was on drugs. That's what makes me angry - they don't know anything about it.'

But Hampshire Police maintain they carried out stop-check procedures correctly and Etherington had been driving normally before they stopped him.

A court heard there is no evidence his drug consumption impaired his driving.

Etherington, from Gosport, pleaded guilty to two counts of death by dangerous driving and was given a nine-year prison sentence in February.

Fury: Rose Allsop says her daughter Jasmine and her best friend Olivia would have been saved had police taken Etherington off the road before the crash

The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against the jail term last week.

The fact he was pulled over before the crash emerged today and police have today confirmed the sequence of events

Rose's son Reece, 16, created drug-driving awareness posters after his sister died at the scene, just yards from their home on November 3 last year.

He said: 'The police should have drug checked him. I think it's just stupid that they didn't.

'Now I'm trying to get the word out there and make people aware not to do drugs and go out and drive.

'It's just as bad as drinking.'

Olivia was taken to hospital where she later died. The pair had been at a party at Jasmine's home.

Hampshire Police stopped Etherington at 3.25am but he was 'behaving normally', a spokesman said.

A force spokesman said: 'The driver, Samuel Etherington, was reported for the defective rear light and he was seen to be behaving normally.

'No inappropriate driving was observed either prior to or following this stop check by these officers.

'The driver was observed as behaving normally at this point and as such no roadside test for intoxication was required.'
