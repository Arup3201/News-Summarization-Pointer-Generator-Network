Afterwards, you're allowed a low-calorie drink before two hours with your personal hairdresser. Then, in skin-tight sportswear, you spend the daytime hours exercising.

Your evenings are a whirl of parties at which you're always the centre of attention, your hair glittering with diamond stars.

19th century beauty tips: Daisy tried a goats' milk bath and veal facial

Finally, at 2am you crawl into bed, but not before you've covered your face in... raw veal. It sounds like the insane beauty regime of a Hollywood star.

In fact, the year is 1875 and this is the beauty routine of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria, who at 38 was dubbed the 'loveliest woman in Europe.' 

I became fascinated with Elisabeth, known as Sisi, when I visited Vienna and saw the gym she had built in her bedroom at the Hofburg Palace.

Her preoccupation with her appearance was so fascinating it became a major theme in my new book The Fortune Hunter. It is a fictionalised account of the beauty's scandalous affair with a dashing army captain ten years her junior and shows how the pressure to look perfect was just as acute then as it is today.

Sisi, who was appalled by the stoutness of other European royals of her time like Queen Victoria, was a fitness fanatic and performed 20 pull-ups every morning on gymnastic rings. Afterwards, she'd be laced into corsets to achieve a 19in waist, and spent her days riding to hounds or hiking.

But it's her beauty regime that makes the mind boggle. As well as her veal face-mask, Sisi bathed in goats' milk, reduced stomach bloating by drinking five salted egg whites, and washed her admired locks in eggs and cognac.

She is even said to have slept with her hands tied above her head so the blood drained away, leaving her hands smooth and white.

Bizarre as it sounds, there is no doubt her beauty regime worked. When she died, aged 60 in 1898, stabbed to the heart by an Italian anarchist, she still had that tiny waist, despite having four children.

Photographs of her - in her 40s and 50s - show she was still astonishingly beautiful. Her marriage to the Emperor was not happy, but she remained irresistible to men of all ages.  

The more I wrote about Sisi, the more I wondered how her beauty regime would work for a modern middle-aged mother of two. There was only one way to find out...

After the 5am bath of cold water, Sisi would have a brisk massage to get her circulation going and her complexion glowing.

Getting up this early was grim - my days usually start at 7am with three cups of tea and a hot shower. But the early start was nothing compared to the ice-cold bath. My shrieks on hitting the water might have woken up the house but my skin glowed, my eye bags shrank and I felt alive.

I couldn't find a masseuse willing to take me on at 5.30 am but gave myself an extremely vigorous rub down with a towel instead.

I don't have gymnastic rings at home so I went to a local gym to follow Sisi's regime of pull-ups and dumbbell exercises with my personal trainer.

Although I cycle everywhere and exercise twice a week, it was a struggle. I could do the leg stretches and dumbbell lifts - just - but I could manage just one pull-up, and that was only to chin level, before collapsing. Sisi's upper-body strength was clearly phenomenal.

Perhaps riding horses might be easier. I learnt as a child, so I went for a ride in Hyde Park.

After an hour-and-a-half of trotting and cantering I was feeling muscles in places I didn't even know I had. Judging by my aches the next day, Sisi's inner thighs must have been made of iron.

There's no way I could have spent all day galloping to hounds like she did. As it was, when my riding session finished I felt like I had been in a spin dryer. And apart from a few gulps of beef tea after her morning exercise, Sisi consumed nothing else during the day apart from a dry biscuit or two (I improvised with an Oxo cube and Ryvita).

Crowning glory: She bathed her hair in eggs and cognac to keep it lustrous

Thick, glossy locks then, as now, were hugely prized. We think the Duchess of Cambridge's mane as a crowning glory, but Sisi's was far more impressive.

Her hairdresser, Baroness Feifalik, toiled for two hours each morning to turn her ankle-length chestnut tresses into a crown of plaits. Washing her locks took a whole day, once a fortnight.

The baroness used a mix of a dozen eggs and a bottle of cognac to keep her mistress's locks lustrous; the eggs for moisture and body, the cognac for shine.

I tried washing my hair with Sisi's unorthodox shampoo. I used two eggs whisked with an inch of brandy and left it in my hair for ten minutes. It smelt delicious - like eggnog - but even after I rinsed it out, my hair felt sticky and the aroma of Christmas followed me around.

My husband kept asking: 'Have you been drinking?

This one was intended to revive Sisi after a day in the saddle.

To keep the skin on her body soft, the Empress bathed in goats' milk, and she used to travel with a herd of goats to this end. Or if she had had a hard day’s hunting she would bathe in hot olive oil to soothe her aching muscles.

Finding enough goats' milk to fill my bath was quite a challenge, as, unlike Sisi, I don't have my own personal flock. It took runs to several supermarkets to get enough to cover my all-too-ample flesh - I used about ten gallons topped up with hot water.

While I wouldn't do this on a regular basis (it cost about £25), the skin on my legs and arms has never been softer. This is probably because the enzymes in the goats' milk tenderise the dry skin.

I certainly didn't need any body lotion afterwards and my impressed husband said my legs looked and felt super smooth.

Cleaning the greasy, tangy bath afterwards was hell (not a problem that an empress has to think about). I didn’t bother with the olive oil as by my calculation to fill my bath would have cost me nearly £800!

Sisi would sleep with warm, damp cloths knotted round her waist because this was thought to shrink it.

I heated damp towels in the microwave to do the same, then wrapped myself in silver foil to keep the heat in and to stop my bed from getting soaking wet.

It wasn't particularly comfortable and I don't think my waist shrank overnight, but perhaps it needs to be done regularly.   

When she felt bloated, Sisi would drink five egg whites mixed with salt. I think it was meant to clear out her digestive system.

Just before going to sleep, I drank the concoction - the single most disgusting thing that has ever passed my lips. I had to have a slug of the hair-washing brandy to keep me from throwing up.

My stomach did look a bit flatter afterwards, but that may have been because the mixture put me off proper food for days.  

Daisy has written a novel based on Sisi's life

Sisi was extremely concerned about the texture of her skin as she spent most of her days hunting. This meaty face pack was thought to repair the ravages of too much exposure to the sun, wind and rain.

Over the veal, she wore a leather mask so she could sleep with it on (presumably to keep her three wolf hounds from nibbling at it).

When I asked my butcher for really thin slices of the meat he asked me what I was using it for. I think he is still laughing at my answer, especially as the humanely-reared veal escalopes cost about £20 for the lot.

The veal felt quite soothing on my skin (I kept mine in place with cling film instead of a leather mask) and it smelt no worse than some face creams.

It wasn't even uncomfortable to sleep in, or perhaps that's because I was exhausted from all the exercise. And my skin did look soft and pink the next morning.

How much of that was dried veal juices I really can't say, although my skin was definitely dewier. But my pillows were a bit worse for wear from the juice that escaped and my husband decided to sleep on the sofa.

After a day and night of Sisi's beauty ritual I can quite understand why she looked so good - but also why her marriage was so unhappy.

The Emperor can't have enjoyed living with a woman who spent her entire day making herself beautiful for other men but not for him.

And who wants to sleep next to a woman wearing a Hannibal Lecter mask and smelling of goats' milk and dripping blood, even if her skin is really soft?
