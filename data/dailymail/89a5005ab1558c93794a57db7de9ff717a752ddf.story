People with a food allergy are more likely to be murdered than to die from a severe allergic reaction, new research has found.

One in 10 children have an allergy and their parents often worry about the dangers of a severe reaction, or anaphylaxis.

Now researchers at Imperial College London have calculated the risk of a person with a food allergy dying from anaphylaxis.

People with food allergies, such as to seafood and peanuts, are more likely to be murdered than to die from a severe allergic reaction. They have a 1.8 in a million chance of dying from a reaction in a year

Based on data from 13 studies, they say the risk in one year is 1.8 in a million.

For children and young people, the risk of 3.25 in a million.

By comparison, in Europe the risk of being murdered is 11 in a million and the risk of dying in an accident is 324 in a million during a year.

Dr Robert Boyle, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, who led the study, said: ‘Everyone has heard stories of people who have died suddenly from a severe allergic reaction, and these stories are frightening.

'But events like this appear to be very rare, and it's helpful to put that risk in perspective.

‘We don't want to belittle the concerns of people with food allergies or their families, and of course people should continue to take reasonable precautions.

‘That said, we want to reassure them that having a food allergy makes a very small difference to someone's overall risk of death.

‘Worrying about severe allergic reactions can take a huge toll on someone's quality of life.

‘We should address anxiety and quality of life for food allergic people and their carers, rather than just focus on the risk of death.’

Food allergies are becoming more common and hospital admissions for children with food allergies have risen five-fold in the last 20 years.
