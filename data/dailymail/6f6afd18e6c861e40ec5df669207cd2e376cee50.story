Lewis Hamilton has punctured sport’s boom industry — the vogue for psychologists.

The championship favourite was reacting to the revelation that his Mercedes team hired Dr Ceri Evans, who prepared the All Blacks for their rugby World Cup triumph in 2011, to work at the last race in China.

Evans, 50, was in the garage to see how engineers and mechanics coped with moments of stress. He did not, however, count drivers Hamilton and Nico Rosberg among his patients.

And nor will he ever — at least in Hamilton’s case. Asked if he had thought of engaging a mind coach, Hamilton said: ‘Never. Never needed one and will never have one. So we’ll never speak of it again unless I start going crazy.

‘(Evans being in China) had zero impact on me. I don’t speak to anyone like that.

‘Since I was 10 I’ve won pretty much every championship I’ve competed in. I’ve never had a mind coach, so why change it?’

Hamilton is seeking his 26th career victory — and fourth consecutive win — here in Barcelona on Sunday, but said: ‘To come in here and say, “four in a row and if I get that then I’ll win the championship” is a load of bull. I just focus on the job in hand.’
