New Englanders struggled to dig out from as much as three feet of snow Saturday and emergency crews used snowmobiles to reach shivering motorists stranded on New York’s Long Island after a howling storm swept through the Northeast.

About 650,000 homes and businesses were left without electricity, and some could be cold and dark for days. Many roads across the New York-to-Boston corridor of roughly 25 million people were impassable. Cars were entombed by drifts. And some people woke up in the morning to find the snow packed so high they couldn’t get their doors open.

'It’s like lifting cement. They say it’s 2 feet, but I think it’s more like 3 feet,' said Michael Levesque, who was shoveling snow in Quincy, Mass., as part of a work crew for a landscaping company.

At least four deaths in the U.S. were
blamed on the overnight snowstorm, including an 11-year-old boy in 
Boston who was overcome by carbon monoxide as he sat in a running car to
keep warm while his father shoveled Saturday morning.

In Providence, Jason Harrison had 
been working for nearly three hours to clear 3 feet of snow that blocked
his driveway and front walk and still had more work to do. His 
snowblower, he said, 'has already paid for itself.'

But neighbors Rebekah and John Speck 
strapped on cross-country skis and coasted past snowdrifts 5 feet high 
and drooping telephone lines encrusted with snow.

Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee 
cautioned that while the snow had stopped, the danger hadn’t passed: 
'People need to take this storm seriously, even after it’s over. If you 
have any kind of heart condition, be careful with the shoveling.'

More than 38 inches of snow fell in 
Milford in central Connecticut, and an 82-mph wind gust was recorded in 
nearby Westport. Areas of southeastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island and 
New Hampshire notched at least two feet — with more falling.

Airlines canceled more than 5,300 
flights through Saturday. New York City's three major airports were up 
and running again by late morning after shutting down the evening 
before. Logan Airport in Boston  was not expected to resume operations 
until late Saturday night.

A nuclear power plant in 
Massachusetts lost power and automatically shut down late on Friday 
during a massive blizzard across the northeastern United States, the 
nuclear regulator said.

The reactor at the Pilgrim Nuclear 
Power Plant in Plymouth closed down with no problems and there was no 
threat to public safety, an official at the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission said.

'There was no impact on plant workers or the public,' he said.

The
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Saturday that diesel generators
were supplying electricity to the plant, which was stable.

The snowstorm, which continued on 
Saturday, disrupted thousands of flights and left more than 200,000 
people without power in Massachusetts alone.

Flooding was also a concern along the
coast. The possibility led to the evacuation of two neighborhoods in 
Quincy, Mass., south of Boston, and of 20 to 30 people in oceanfront 
homes in Salisbury in northeastern Massachusetts, authorities in those 
towns said.

But it did not appear to create major
problems in New York and New Jersey, states hit hardest during last 
October's Superstorm Sandy.

Snow piled up so high in some places Saturday that people couldn't open 
their doors to get outside. Streets were mostly deserted throughout New 
England save for plow crews and a few hardy souls walking dogs or 
venturing out to take pictures.

In Boston's Financial District, the 
only sound was an army of snowblowers clearing sidewalks. Streets in 
many places were inaccessible.

Even the U.S. Postal Service closed post offices and suspended mail delivery Saturday in New England.

Some of the worst of the storm 
appeared to hit Connecticut, where all roads were ordered closed 
Saturday. The snow made travel nearly impossible even for emergency 
responders who found themselves stuck on highways all night.
