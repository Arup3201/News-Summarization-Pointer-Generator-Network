A plus-size clothing company has come under fire for  shaming skinny women after its PR campaign, which saw them take to the streets of London to go 'Skinny Bird Watching', backfired.

Taking Shape sent staff armed with binoculars out on the streets outside Somerset House - the hub of London Fashion Week - dressed as bird watchers. 

They then appeared to mock the slim women who were spotted walking past them, peering at them as they went by.

Taking Shape has come under fire after taking to the streets of London to go 'Skinny Bird Watching'

As a slim woman walked by the employees of Taking Shape watched her with their binoculars 

But women of all shapes and sizes took to Twitter to condemn the company, saying that body shaming of any type is not acceptable. 

Hayley Carr, who blogs under the name London Beauty Queen, tweeted: 'Skinny shaming is NOT the way forward. 

'We should build the confidence of women in ALL shapes & sizes @TakingShapeUK #skinnybirdwatching.'

Another named Emma Millard wrote: 'The only this I have to say on this ridiculous #SkinnyBirdWatching PR stunt is disappointing. 

'Tongue in cheek Body Shaming is not good PR [sic].'

A woman named @LeStewpot said: 'It's a thoughtless & cruel social media campaign. @TakingShapeUK needs to stop their #SkinnyBirdWatching.' 

Many users took to Twitter to express their anger at the company

The Taking Shape women carried clip boards which reportedly contained a 'Field Guide' which said size 6 women are like rare exotic birds 

The Taking Shape employees were apparently sent out with a 'Field Guide' which likened size 6 women to rare exotic birds. 

One plus size woman took to Twitter to start posting #FatBirdWatching in a bid to show the company the error of their ways. 

Whilst another user named @LemonaidLies tweeted: 'How do they think #SkinnyBirdWatching was an acceptable thing. Shaming one size to praise another is totally wrong, size doesn't define you!'

Fashion models are known for their slim frames, something which Taking Shape thinks should change

Women took to Twitter in their droves to point out that skinny shaming is just as bad as fat shaming 

The same user also wrote a blog which said: 'How is standing in the middle of London shaming girls for being to skinny OK?

'How did they think that any one would find it acceptable. Really does being a size make you who you are or make you any less beautiful or change your personality NO IT DOES NOT!'

@MissTashaFearne said: 'So sad at #skinnybirdwatching Shaming ANY girl of ANY size is wrong! Women should stick together! Life is tough enough,don't make it worse!'  

These two users pointed out that it doesn't matter what shape or size you are body shaming shouldn't happen

The two employees of Taking Shape pretend to look at a female fashion week goes through their binoculars 

In a video posted by the company Alla Buinowicz, the Managing Director of Taking Shape says: 'Today we're here at London Fashion Week, just to bring some focus to curvy women of the world.

'The average size in the UK is a size 16 yet today on the catwalk there's going to be a whole heap of size 6's so it's just a bit of fun, a tongue in cheek Skinny Bird Watching Society.

'Just to say, "Hey, let's put all women onto the catwalk," especially some curvy ones and size 16s. It's tongue in cheek, we're just having some fun. 

'We love all women skinny, large, tall but you know, our business is about being in the plus sizes of curvy women.' 

Taking Shape is a plus-size retailed specialising in clothes between sizes 14 and 26. They say on their website: 'We love inspiring women and making them feel good in what they wear.' 

The company started in Australia but now sells their clothes all over the world. 

Femail spoke to Alla who said that the company did not mean to offend anyone with their campaign. 

She told us: 'At Taking Shape, we believe all women are beautiful whatever their shape or size. Our stunt during London Fashion Week was meant to convey this, and our only aim was to highlight that ALL shapes and sizes should be treated equally on the catwalk. 

'As a brand, we are incredibly passionate about embracing fashion and women's body shapes. We had absolutely no intention of offending anyone during our stunt and we can only apologise to those who felt personally upset by our activity. 

'This was a light hearted initiative and whilst this tone came across in person on the day, we can see the message didn’t translate well on social media. We celebrate all women all shapes and sizes.'
