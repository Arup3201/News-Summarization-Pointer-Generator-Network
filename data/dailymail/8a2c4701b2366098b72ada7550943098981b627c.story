This brave climber was clearly not put off by the threat of frostbite as he scaled an icy mountain to pose completely naked at its peak.

Despite freezing temperatures, intrepid Dan Arkle climbed Crib Goch near Snowdon, North Wales, in the depth of winter and shed his clothes in the snow to embrace the dawn totally starkers.

The 35-year-old photographer tackled the icy mountain by torchlight, using an ice axe and crampons to reach the highest ridge, before stripping off.

Starkers: The climber said he was worried about getting frostbite... and not just on his feet

Casting off everything including his hiking boots he then traversed the knife-edge peak and posed for these cheeky pictures.

He had driven from his home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, through the night to reach Snowdonia, before climbing the mountain alone, eventually arriving at his destination, 3,028ft above sea level, by sunrise.

Mr Arkle said: 'One of the reasons people go into the mountains is for a feeling of awe at being surrounded by powerful and elemental forces.

'I wanted to highlight how weak and vulnerable humans are in such a place without modern technology and protective equipment.

Fully dressed: Mr Arkle in his usual climbing gear

'It was surprisingly mild at just below zero with no wind which is a good job as I was worried about getting frostbite and not just on my feet.

'I walked a few hundred yards naked until my feet got too cold, it felt very free to not be weighed down by my usual equipment and to feel the snow crunching between my toes.

'There was a huge sheer drop to each side so I needed to go very slowly and carefully.'
