Embarrassing: Germany's education minister Annette Schavan has been stripped of her philosophy doctorate after her university found her guilty of plagiarism

The German minister for education is under pressure to resign after being stripped of her philosophy doctorate for alleged plagiarism.

Annette Schavan, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been rocked by the decision of the University of Duesseldorf after they said parts of her 1980 doctoral thesis had been copied.

Incredibly, she is the second minister to be accused of plagiarism in the German government after defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg was also found to have copied work for his thesis and quit in 2011.

The University of Duesseldorf launched an investigation after an accusation against Mrs Schavan was posted online by an anonymous blogger.

A faculty committee concluded that her work, which dealt with the formation of conscience, included a 'substantial number of unaccredited direct quotes from other texts'.

In a statement declaring the doctorate invalid and withdrawing it from Ms Schavan, the faculty head Bruno Bleckmann said they had 'decided by secret ballot, by 12 votes to two, with one abstention'.

Mrs Schavan has said she will take legal action against the decision, but it is an untimely distraction for Angela Merkel ahead of September's national election.

'I will not accept the decision of the University of Duesseldorf and I will file a lawsuit against it,' Mrs Schavan, 57, told reporters during a visit to Johannesburg, South Africa.

She declined to make any further comment for legal reasons.

The accusations of plagiarism are especially embarrassing for Mrs Schavan because she oversees Germany's universities and had previously been scathing in her criticism of Mr Guttenberg, who resigned a month after losing his doctorate.

'An education minister who is proven to have grossly violated academic rules cannot continue in the post,' said Renate Kuenast, a leading member of the opposition Greens.

'I assume that Frau Schavan will spare herself and education a prolongation of this affair by resigning.'

Mrs Merkel has not publicly commented on the Schavan case. But members of her centre-right coalition said the minister had fallen victim to a politically motivated campaign to damage the government ahead of the autumn federal election.

Recurring problem: Mrs Schavan is the second government minister to be found guilty of plagiarism after former defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg who resigned in 2011

Plagiarised: The University of Duesseldorf said Annette Schavan's work had a 'substantial number of unaccredited direct quotes from other texts'

The German media has been mostly critical of Mrs Schavan.

'If the education minister has cheated in her doctoral thesis, it is like the finance minister secretly hiding away his money in Switzerland or the traffic minister driving a car while drunk,' said the Bild newspaper.

'There is no alternative (to resignation) for her.'

In Tuesday's ruling, the Duesseldorf University commission said Schavan had 'systematically and intentionally presented intellectual performance that in reality she did not generate herself'.

The decision left Schavan without an academic title, an important symbol of status in German politics and business, as her degree programme in philosophy finished solely with a PhD.

Since the allegations first arose in May last year, Schavan has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and said she wrote her dissertation with a clear conscience.

Her lawyers have said the proceedings of the commission had been riddled with mistakes and were unlawful, not least because information was leaked to the public in the process.
