Justice minister Andrew Selous said the disabled often worked harder because they were 'grateful' to have a job

A Tory minster has claimed disabled people are often harder grafters because they are 'grateful' to be in work.

Justice minister Andrew Selous made the remarks at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham earlier this month.

The revelation comes just days after David Cameron faced calls to sack welfare minister Lord Freud after he claimed some disabled people were 'not worth' the minimum wage.

Mr Selous, a former parliamentary aide to Welfare Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, told a fringe meeting on social justice - that in his experience the disabled often made excellent employees. 

According to the Independent on Sunday he said: 'Disabled people work harder because they're grateful to have a job.'

Dave Adams, of the Napo probation union, said he was 'shocked' by Mr Selous' remarks.

He said: 'It was one of those moments where you think 'did he really just say that?'.'

Mr Selous defended his position last night. He said: 'I was Iain Duncan Smith's PPS [Parliamentary Private Secretary] for four years.

'My recollection is that the point I was making was the feedback I had... that employers are often very, very pleased with disabled employees; they work harder, they are loyal. These are good reasons to employ disabled people and offenders.'

But Labour's shadow disabilities minister Kate Green said: 'These new comments about disabled people from another Tory minister show they just don't get it.

'Many would love to work, but Tory policies are failing disabled people.'

The party's shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves told the Independent on Sunday that Labour would be tabling a motion of no confidence in Lord Freud next week.

She said: 'David Cameron's failure to act after Lord Freud said that some disabled people are 'not worth the full wage' is astonishing... it's clear the mask has slipped and the nasty party is back.

'Labour will table a motion of no confidence in Lord Freud because we believe it's completely unacceptable that David Cameron has failed to sack his minister for Welfare Reform.'

Labour will table the no-confidence motion tomorrow and the vote will be on October 29.

The Cabinet minister has faced calls to sack his welfare minister Lord Freud this week over his comments about the disabled

Welfare minister Lord Freud said some disabled people were being stopped from working because they were 'not worth' the minimum wage

Lord Freud's remarks were revealed by Labour leader Ed Miliband during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.

Mr Miliband ambushed the PM with a transcript of the minister's controversial remarks taken from a secret recording.

Lord Freud was forced to issue a grovelling apology following the Commons bust up, but Labour have pushed for him to be sacked.

Shadow cabinet minister Angela Eagle said: 'I do think he should resign. I think what he said… has caused a great deal of offence to disabled people.

'There are 50 per cent of people with disabilities who are not in work at the moment. The answer to that isn't to somehow weaken the minimum wage and make them work for less than the minimum wage.'

Labour shadow minister Angela Eagle was criticised on Question Time for attacking Lord Freud's remarks

But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was clear Lord Freud had been talking about the state 'topping up' the incomes of disabled people.

Lord Freud comments came in response to a councillor with a severely disabled daughter who suggested that people with mental health problems may be unable to work because employers are unwilling to pay them the statutory minimum.

He suggested that some disabled workers were 'not worth' the £6.50 minimum wage and were therefore locked out of work.
