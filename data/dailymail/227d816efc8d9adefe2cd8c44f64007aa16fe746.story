A teenage girl who drowned in a river was praised last night after it emerged she was trying to save her best friend’s life even though she couldn’t swim.

Tonibeth Purvis, 15, jumped in to help Chloe Fowler, 14, who got into difficulties after taking a dip to cool off.

Firemen said the friends disappeared from the surface after being caught in the dangerous currents of the River Wear.

After a six-hour search involving more than 100 emergency services rescuers and members of the public, the bodies of both teenagers were found by police divers on Tuesday night.

News of Tonibeth’s bravery came as it 
emerged that a 27-year-old man drowned yesterday swimming in Thirlmere 
Reservoir near Keswick, Cumbria. He had not been identified last night.

Chloe and Tonibeth’s devastated families and friends led tributes to the popular schoolgirls last night.

Tracey Scott, 37, a neighbour of 
Tonibeth’s, said: ‘She was a total hero, it’s the type of thing she 
would do. It was brave of her because she couldn’t swim. It’s horrible 
to think she was in there.’

The pair were among a group of teenagers relaxing by the river at the Fatfield beauty spot in Washington, Tyne and Wear.

Police said Chloe had waded into the river to cool off but was pulled into the fast-flowing water at around 3pm.

Tonibeth and two other friends leapt in to help her, but quickly found themselves struggling.

An off-duty policeman and another passer-by also jumped into the river but were unable to find the girls in the murky water.

Superintendent Alan Veitch, of 
Northumbria Police, said: ‘She went in to keep cool. There were a lot of
children who were trying to effect a rescue.’

The other youngsters who went in to help are receiving trauma counselling having almost drowned themselves.

Army recruit Drew Garnett told how he 
also tried to save the two girls when he saw them in trouble. The 
18-year-old was with his girlfriend when he saw the teenagers being 
swept away. He said: ‘The current swept them down the river. I shouted 
to my girlfriend to go and get help.

‘She ran up the bank and I snapped a 
branch off a tree and went to reach them. They were in the centre of the
river. One girl had already gone under. One was poking out the water.

‘I tried to reach her with the stick 
but it wasn’t long enough. I took one step in up to a foot around my 
ankles. It still wasn’t long enough, but before I could take a second 
step she was gone.

‘We went up to the main bridge to see 
if we could see them but we couldn’t. It was absolutely horrible to see.
I can’t imagine what the families are feeling. I feel absolutely 
terrible about it.’

Chloe’s family said in a statement 
last night: ‘Chloe was a beautiful, kind and caring girl and we are 
devastated by what has happened. We would like to thank everyone 
involved in helping us to look for the girls.’

Tonibeth’s aunt, Sam Mccabe, wrote 
online: ‘Still can’t believe my beautiful niece has gone. I can’t stop 
crying, I just can’t get my head around this. Life is so cruel. I miss 
you so much Tonibeth. I love you, you little hero.’

And her cousin, Jake Winter, said: ‘She gave her life away, how many people would do that?

‘These people are possibly the strongest fighters I know. They were best friends and didn’t let anything get in the way of that.

Sunderland, attended Oxclose Community Academy, where she was said to be
‘popular and determined to succeed’.
