World-renowned pastry chef Dominique Ansel is at it again: This time, the genius behind the Cronut is whipping up Pretzel Lobster Tails.

The treats, which will go on sale at his Manhattan bakery this coming Saturday, are soft pretzels stuffed with peanut butter and butter-crunch brittle - all in the shape of a crustacean.

And, like real lobster tails often do, the sweets come with sea salt and a butter sauce for dipping. They are served warm, so the butter melts easily and the dough is extra soft.

Mr Ansel said the shape is optimal for breaking off bite-size pieces and immersing them in the whipped honey brown butter.

'We were thinking of other things that also tasted good with butter, and someone joked lobster since it’s summer.' he said in a press release. 'We immediately thought of the lobster tail and how it was the perfect shape for tearing apart and dipping segments. It’s all about that buttery dipping sauce.'

In anticipation of the treats being a hot item, the bakery is letting customers buy only one at a time. They will be for sale all summer long, and no end date has yet been given.

Hot spot: The Dominique Ansel bakery opened in New York's Soho in 2011

Mr Ansel rose to fame last year after inventing the Cronut, a donut/croissant hybrid that customers line up for every morning hours before the bakery opens.

Since then, he has continued to innovate his dessert offerings by creating a chocolate chip cookie shot, a chocolate souffle hidden in a brioche, and a sundae in a can.

He opened up his bakery, which is located in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood, in 2011. Earlier this year, the James Beard Foundation named him as America's best pastry chef.
