Oxford University: Places come from the top five comprehensives

Five elite British schools are sending more pupils to Oxford and Cambridge than all of the country's 2000 comprehensives and colleges combined, a study has revealed.

Four prestigious private schools and only one state school produced 946 Oxford and Cambridge entrants over three years.

At the same time the 2,000 worst-performing state schools, two thirds of the national total, produced only 927 Oxbridge students.

The leading fee-paying schools, which charge around £30,000 a year, are Eton, Westminster, St Paul’s School and St Paul’s Girls School.

The only state school to make the grade, Hills Road college, is based in the heart of Cambridge and caters for the children of leading academics and scientists based in the university city.

The startling figures were disclosed in the first study of its kind by the Sutton Trust, an education charity which analysed the onward education destinations of 750,000 school leavers.

The data also shows that grammar schools fare very well when it comes to university places.

On average, grammars sent 65 per cent of their pupils to the top 30 institutions, compared with only 28 per cent for comprehensives.

The 100 elite schools – 3 per cent of the national total – accounted for 32 per cent of admissions to Oxbridge.

Only 12 council areas sent more than 2 per cent of A-level candidates to Oxbridge – and all but one of these were in the south-east of England. The exception was Trafford in Greater Manchester.

The findings highlight the extent to 
which the choice of school dictates the life chances of youngsters and 
the Coalition said the report showed Labour had failed young people.

Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: ‘This report is a damning indictment of Labour’s failure to improve social mobility.

‘Despite all their promises, they 
left hundreds of thousands of children with little to no chance of 
getting to the best universities.

‘We are tackling these inequalities by increasing the number of good schools and targeting funding at the poorest pupils.’

The Sutton Trust figures show that Westminster, attended by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, sent the most pupils to Oxbridge between 2007 and 2009 – 235.

Next was Eton with 211, followed by Hills Road with 204, St Paul’s School with 167 – a staggering 46 per cent of its pupils – and St Paul’s Girls School with 129.

The grammar sending the largest proportion of students to Oxbridge was Queen Elizabeth’s in Barnet, North London.

Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said schools would try harder to raise standards if they were made to publish data showing the destinations of their leavers. Brian Lightman, of headteachers’ union ASCL, suggested poor pupils were put off applying to Oxbridge.

‘Regardless of ability level, students from more disadvantaged backgrounds will sometimes find Oxford and Cambridge a foreign and intimidating world,’ he said.

Meanwhile, almost 200,000 youngsters have been denied university entry after a record surge in applications.

A total of 669,956 youngsters chased the 479,000 places available in the final year before tuition fees rise up to a maximum £9,000.

Students without offers will have to scramble for places through clearing when their  A-level results are published next month.

But opportunities are expected to be limited because few students will take a gap year ahead of the fees rise.
