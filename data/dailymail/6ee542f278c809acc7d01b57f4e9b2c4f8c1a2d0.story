Nine rookie police officers have lost their jobs because of a drunken graduation party in northern New Jersey.

It all happened when members of the academy’s 113th graduating class gathered at Texas Arizona in Hoboken, New Jersey, to celebrate their big day.

A source says that the officers 'were drunk and out of control, and identified themselves as police officers when resisting bar bouncers who tried to quiet them.' 

Venue: The Port Authority investigated after news reports emerged of an out-of-control party at the Texas Arizona Bar and Grill in Hoboken, New Jersey, (pictured) after the graduation ceremony in August

According to NJ.com, the bar then contacted the Hoboken Police Department, who in turn contact the Port Authority Police Department. 

Now, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says it's re-examining the entire candidate selection and training process. 

In a statement, executive director Pat Foye calls it 'a sad day' for the department. Foye says he was disappointed by their conduct and appalled by the 'poor judgment' of the police academy's staff who attended.

Damning: It has been reported that the Internal Affairs Bureau got hold of 'devastating' video evidence from inside the bar which lead to the officers' dismissal 

Three other new officers are suspended without pay for 30 days and will have their probationary status extended for a year. Three supervisors and two other officers will face disciplinary proceedings.

No names were released.

Video footage, along with eyewitness reports, led to the dismissals.

The site reported that the video was given to the Internal Affairs Bureau and was so clear they could see the badge numbers of those involved. 

Making an already bad situation even worse, was the fact that some of the officers were untruthful during the investigation into what happened.

There were 210 men and 39 women at the graduation ceremony. Many of them will be posted at One World Trade Center and Ground Zero.
