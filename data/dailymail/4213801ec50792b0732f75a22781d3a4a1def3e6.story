England captain Steven Gerrard says his team have 'no fear' ahead of their World Cup opening clash against Italy in the jungle city of Manaus this evening.

He also played down fears over the state of the pitch in Manaus, saying it would pose no problems to their game plan.

The players certainly looked relaxed in a selfie posted online by forward Daniel Sturridge, showing the England stars relaxing on their team bus in Brazil.

And their spirits will be cheered with the news that Italy's captain and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is out with an ankle injury he picked up yesterday in training.

Speaking to The Mirror, 34-year-old Gerrard said the young squad are 'fit and ready to go', adding: ‘We can’t wait to get started. Of course we have respect for Italy, they are a great team with wonderful players.

'But no fear, we are confident and cannot wait for the kick-off now to get going. We have a game plan.’

Liverpool striker Sturridge posted the picture yesterday evening with the message: 'Now we're cooking!! #squad #worldcup 2104 #team #england shoutout to Luke Shaw for the sweet boy pose. I see you baby lol.'

Steven Gerrard also posted a photograph on his Instagram account overlooking the Arena da Amazonia, saying: 'A view of the stadium through the jungle. The wait is almost over.'

Meanwhile manager Roy Hodgson urged millions of fans back home to support his squad through their tough group stage, saying the team wanted to give supporters something to cheer about.

Summing up the team's expectations, he quoted the RAF's Latin motto, Ardua ad Astra, meaning 'through adversity to the stars'.

Back in the UK fans are waiting in anticipation for the match to start, with retailers expecting a £1billion  spending bonanza from sales of TVs, football shirts, bunting, flags, party food and drink.

But there are also fears that the tournament could lead to ugly scenes in some town centres thanks to a controversial decision to extend pub opening hours to cover the 11pm.

A third of those planning to watch the game in the UK are expected to be in a pub or bar, and police and paramedics are braced for a rise in alcohol-fuelled violence.

They point to a potentially toxic mix of warm weather and the fact that the Government has allowed pubs to open late to cater for the 11pm kick off.

Thousands of extra police officers are being deployed around the country as forces put on extra patrols to clamp down on drunken thuggish behaviour.

The London Ambulance Service plans to 
run special ‘booze buses’ – which look similar to mini-vans – that can 
accommodate six drunks at a time.

West Midlands Ambulance Service said it is treating tonight like a ‘mini New Year’.

Elsewhere Prime Minister David Cameron touted the government's decision to open pubs late, saying the whole country would be 'gathering around the TV and sitting in the pub' to cheer on the team.

He added: 'It is a tough draw, some say it couldn't be tougher but we are right behind you, every step of the way. Go for it.'
