Designers from Dolce & Gabbana to Ghost have sent dresses reminiscent of nightwear down the catwalk, and some stars have even worn nighties out on the town.

So was Loose Women presenter Andrea McLean, 45, able to tell dress from nightie?

1.  

This must be a dress — it has lining, a zip and smoothed over all my lumps and bumps. It was comfortable and I would happily wear it to dinner with a simple three-quarter-length jacket.

When I found it was a nightie, I was shocked. I’d feel very overdressed if I wore this in bed.

A nightie if ever I saw one! I wouldn’t be brave enough to wear it out and about, because the colour is so unforgiving.

The cut would only work for the very brave: one twirl on the dancefloor and everyone would see every bit of my tummy.

So imagine my surprise when I discovered it was actually a dress!

I knew this was a dress from the start. It felt secure, comfortable and I’d happily go out for a meal in it. 

It’s not my usual style, but is surprisingly flattering. 

Also, unlike a real nightie, which is usually lighter and gathers around all the bits you don’t want it to, this is weighty so hangs off my curves well. My favourite.

Although I suspected this is a nightie, it’s far too pretty to go to bed in!

I love the colour, the fit and the shawl back, and it slims in all the right places.

I felt a little bit exposed, though, and I’m really not sure I’d be confident enough to wear it in public. It’s elegant and looks like a dress from the back. With the right underwear, it could look lovely.

I expected to be surprised by this one, but due to the lining I decided it was almost certainly a dress — and I was right.

It felt very soft and the material was gorgeous — it also had lots of movement, which I love.

And, unlike the others, I wouldn’t need a bra, thanks to its internal boning. This was my second favourite: I felt dressed-up and sophisticated.
