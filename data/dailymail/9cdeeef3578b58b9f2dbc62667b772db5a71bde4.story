Google Chrome has officially overtaken Microsoft's Internet Explorer as the most popular web browser in the U.S. for the first time, commanding 31.8 percent of the combined desktop and mobile internet market, according to new figures.

A report released by Adobe Digital Index (ADI) analyzing the market share of web browsers has shown Google's freeware is up 6 percent year-over-year, trouncing Internet Explorer - once a lone internet leader - which is sitting at 30.9 percent.

The figures combine internet usage on both desktop and mobile devices, the latter of which has helped both Google and Apple exponentially thanks to the growing prevalence of phone internet use.

Apple’s Safari came in third with a market share of 25 percent, reported CMO.com.

Google's Chrome browser has overtaken Microsoft Internet Explorer as the most popular Web interface in the U.S. While Microsoft still maintains a prominent desktop presence (see graph), its lack of market among mobile browsers has seen it pipped by Chrome, which is sitting just in front with 31.8 percent

Mozilla's Firefox browser—which consistently held a minor, yet steady, position—declined from nearly 20% market share two years ago to only 8.7% in April.

According to ADI, this decline is likely due to its lack of mobile presence.

'Control of the browser gives Google an even greater role in consumers’ lives,' principal analyst at ADI. Tamara Gaffney, told CMO.

'Not only do the Chrome and Android browsers both default to Google search, but with their Gmail and Google+ extensions, consumers are spending more and more time signed into Google’s ecosystem.'

Google Chrome was already a market leader worldwide, with StatCounter estimating its usage at 43 percent.

Dominance: Apple's Safari browser has cornered the mobile market thanks to overwhelming popularity of the iPhone

In 2011 Google began to climb in Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Russia, and Italy.

However the new data represents such America.

ADI technology analyst Tyler White said the results are likely due to the increased reliance of the mobile operating system.

Internet Explorer had long held onto its dominance by being the default web browser on desktops.

But mobile devices are not relying on Internet Explorer as a web portal, instead defaulting or embedding Chrome or Safari, predominantly.

White added that people like to have 'a consistent experience across devices'.

Internet Explorer still retains the lead as the go-to web browser in the US with 43.3 percent, but Google Chrome is growing fast, sitting at 30.6 percent

That is, someone is using Safari on their iPhone all day, for example, they are likely to use it at home or at the office when working on a computer.

Chrome, which is rumored to become the default browser on all Android devices in the near future, offers a consistent interface with sharable bookmarks in a fully functional browser capable on desktop and mobile, CMO reported.

Google has seen even more success outside of the U.S., where it took over the market share lead last year.

Google Chrome began its international assault in 2011, when it began to grow in Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Russia, and Italy
