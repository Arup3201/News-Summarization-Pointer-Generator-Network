She went on to add: 'I loved working with Nelly on their Christmas campaign and I found so many favorites for the perfect party evening.'

'With the Icons collection I can truly relate to my own personal style and how I want to feel and love that I now can be a style inspiration for a fashionable young woman who works hard for what she wants.'

This isn't Lily's only big job of the moment though, she is currently gearing up for the Victoria's Secret show in London on the 2nd of December. 

Her role as an 'Angel' means that Lily - who is married to Kings Of Leon front man Caleb Followill - didn't have to go through the rigorous audition process and was a shoe in for the show. 

She joins the likes of Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Behati Prinsloo, Candice Swanepoel, Douzten Kroes and Karlie Kloss all of whom will walk the famous catwalk.

It has also been announced that Taylor Swift will perform on the runway for the second year running.

Recently the brands chief marketing officer Ed Razek spoke out about how competitive the models get when trying to win a place alongside Lily and co.

'Every year it gets more competitive,' he said, 'They're all working out, so many of them are boxing, so many of them are doing Pilates.' 

The show's executive producer Monica Mitro said of their casting selection: 'We're looking for well-proportioned, beautiful skin, great personality, which is quite unique and rare.' 

Just this week they announced the six themes for the show this year; Gilded angels, Exotic traveler, Fairy tale, Dream girl, University of pink and Angel ball. 

As well as Taylor Ed Sheeran, Arianna Grande and Hozier will all also perform.   

Happy couple: Lily married her husband Kings of Leon singer Caleb Followill in 2011 

Beautiful mother: Lily has two year old daughter, Dixie Pearl, but says she's become more interested in fashion since giving birth

As well as working as a successful model Lily is mother to a two year old daughter Dixie Pearl Followill. 

However Lily has previously revealed that giving birth hasn't changed the way she views fashion: 'I feel I've become way more into fashion, my style and everything since becoming a mother,' she said.

'I don't know why, I just love clothes even more now, if that's possible... I try to be as effortless as possible when I'm getting dressed. 

'I just like being cool and easy, whether it's classic or more on trend, it changes every day'  

What an Angel: Lily is one of the Victoria's Secrets Angels and will walk in the London show in December
