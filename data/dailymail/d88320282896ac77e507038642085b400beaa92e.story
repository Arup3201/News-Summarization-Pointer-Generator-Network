When a Premier League club signs a global superstar, they often tweet a picture of the new arrival putting pen to paper on the deal.

But things are a little different in League Two, where Cheltenham Town attempted to unveil their loan signing Eusebio Bancessi.

Bancessi, an arrival from Wolves, was pictured supposedly signing his new contract on Friday - but Cheltenham forgot to provide the contract.

Eusebio Bancessi puts pen to table as he joins Cheltenham Town on loan from Wolves for a month

Bancessi has not yet played a first team game for Wolves since arriving from Benfica in 2013

Instead the player was left with a pen in his hand, as if he were about to sign the desk to seal the deal.

Bancessi joined Wolves from Benfica in 2013 but has not started a first-team game for the midlands club.

The 19-year-old Portuguese forward will join Cheltenham with a month, although the deal could be extended.

Wolves responded by claiming the Portuguese striker only ever puts his signature on tables

The young striker is quick and powerful and could make a big impact during his short stay in Cheltenham
