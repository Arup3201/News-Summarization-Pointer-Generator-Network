Her baby is not yet two months old. But last night as the Duchess of Cambridge made her first appearance on the red carpet since she gave birth, she showed the world she was ready to cast off her dressing gown and step back into the spotlight.

She is, after all, the new jewel in the Royal family's crown, partly behind their sharp rise in global popularity. And certainly worth a designer frock or two.

The frock of last night - a gold, floor-length sequin gown from Jenny Packham's current collection worth around £2,500 - was certainly a showstopper.

Dazzling Duchess: Kate arriving at the inaugural Tusk Conservation Awards at the Royal Society in London

Her shoes - the £484 Vamp style from Jimmy Choo - were about as far from the standard issue ballet pump favoured by the yummy mummy Sloane set as they come. She accessorised with diamond drop earrings and a diamond bracelet, which was reportedly a wedding gift from Prince Charles.

The message she was sending out was clear: I am a glamorous woman who can do it all: Be a mother, a fashion icon, a charitable ambassador, and a wife. Oh yes - and I can be slim, polished, beautiful and cheerful while I'm doing it.

As far as we know, Kate may well have been furiously pumping milk for George moments before she stepped out the door.

She might have been in agony from overfull breasts as George's feeding times slipped by. And she may have suffered the very real fear that one of her breast pads might slip loose on the red carpet.

Perfect in Packham: Kate's sleeveless 
gown flattered her already-slender post-baby body. The high neck and 
draped back added another layer of dimension and dram

All of these things can be issues for new mothers and, at less than two months in, it's rare for a mother to feel entirely comfortable about slipping back into her old role.

But whatever she may have been feeling under that newly tanned, line-free, smiling face of hers - maybe the fear that a mewling baby might wake her every hour during the night when she got home - she let none of it show.

Here we look at the detail that went into Kate's debut red carpet look.

HAIR

While last week some picky observers 
mentioned her hair was lacklustre, 
last night her newly tinted chestnut locks looked like something straight
out of a L'Oreal ad.

Her hair looked to have been tinted and cut ahead of the event, likely by her trusted stylist Amanda Cook Tucker.

Amanda is the hair stylist who arrived at the 
hospital with an assistant to give Kate perfect glossy locks for her grand departure after giving birth to George in July.

Natural beauty: The Duchess wore her hair loose around her shoulders, with understated make-up save for her dramatic smoky eyes

Amanda Cook Tucker, 50,
often styles Kate's hair at home and has been cutting William and 
Harry's hair for years - since they were children, in fact.

Amanda Cook Tucker has been 
Kate's hairdresser since the couple visited the Far East on a Diamond 
Jubilee Visit in September last year. The stylist was credited with 
giving Kate heat-proof hair that defied the humid Asian weather.

Bad hair day: Kate had been criticised for her unusually lacklustre locks when she stepped out in Anglesey recently

Amanda and Kate are said to have become close, the stylist is known for her discretion and has always kept a
low profile.

Her ex-husband Neville Tucker also has Royal connections: his
Knightsbridge salon held the Royal Warrant from 1980 to 1994 and he 
worked closely with the Queen’s longest-serving hairdresser, Charles 
Martyn.

Kate added to her dazzling look with diamond drop earrings and a diamond bracelet. The bejewelled bangle is said to have been a wedding gift from Prince Charles.

SHOES

She was once criticised by shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood for her fondness for a demure LK Bennett heel.

'Why
can't she be more "princessy", he railed. And last night, with her 
spectacular silver Jimmy Choo heels (she won't be wearing Nicholas 
Kirkwood any time soon, we're guessing) Kate proved she could dress to 
impress as well as any Royal.

Dressy: The Duchess wore her trusty silver crackled leather shoes by Jimmy Choo, which retail for £484

But Kirkwood should note 
that this was not the first time Kate has worn designer shoes - in fact, she often steps out at red carpet events in the dazzling £484 heels.

The Duchess wore the 
sparkly Jimmy Choos for a red carpet appearance in L.A. last 
year, when she paired them with a lilac Alexander McQueen gown. She slipped them on again in May the same year at Claridge's 
hotel in Mayfair for a meeting of the Thirty Club, whose members are 
some of the most powerful men and women in advertising and the media.

Deja-vu? The Duchess has stepped out in the dazzling shoes many times before, usually at high-profile red carpet events and premieres

Careful: She was sure to slightly pull up the front of the Packham gown to avoid disaster as she took the stairs in the floor length gown and towering heels
