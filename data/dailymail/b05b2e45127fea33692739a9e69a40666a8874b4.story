The flecks of grey hair betray his advancing years but, even at 37, Emile Heskey does not have to think too far back for his last appearances in a Liverpool shirt.

November. Two games against a Singapore Select XI and Thailand Over 30s. Heskey was playing for a Liverpool Legends team and the pre-match preparations were, let us say, not quite what they were in his Anfield heyday.

‘It was different,’ says Heskey, breaking into laughter. ‘I’m used to going to bed at a certain time, especially before a game.

Heskey enjoys himself during a recent press conference ahead of his return to Anfield 

‘Robbie Fowler asked if I wanted to play and I thought, “yeah, I’m not doing anything, I’ll come out”. There was me, Robbie, Didi (Hamann), Macca (Steve McManaman), Stephane Henchoz, David Thompson and Patrik Berger. Who kept me up? Everyone.’

Two months on and there have been no more late nights as Heskey, an FA Cup winner with Liverpool 14 years ago, returns to Anfield to face his old club in the fourth round on Saturday as a Bolton Wanderers player.

The last few weeks have, he admits, ‘been a bit of a whirlwind’.

‘At 37, would I have been thinking I’d be playing against Liverpool at Anfield? Probably not, but I’m going to relish every moment.

‘It’s going to be great. You get into football for the love of the game and to win trophies, and I managed to do that at Liverpool. I had a wonderful time.’

Heskey’s thoughts were turning to the beach in Antigua when a chance meeting with Neil Lennon, an old Leicester City team-mate, led to an invitation to have a trial for Bolton in an Under 21 game.

After leaving the Premier League, Heskey went to play in the A-League with Newcastle Jets

But a chance meeting with former Leicester City team-mate Neil Lennon earned him a move to Bolton

The 6ft 2in former England striker had not played properly for six months since being released by Australian club Newcastle Jets. He was training at Blackburn but Lennon saw enough in the first 15 minutes to know that he could still play in the Championship.

Heskey signed a short-term deal on Christmas Eve and scored for his new club against Blackburn two days later, assisted by Eidur Gudjohnsen, another veteran enjoying a new lease of life at Bolton.

‘I tried to sign Emile for Celtic but the big bugger wouldn’t come,’ says Lennon. ‘He didn’t have a choice this time once I got a grip on him.’

Heskey’s career peaked at Liverpool. A battering ram of a centre forward, he scored 60 goals in 223 games after signing for a then club record £11million, and was part of Gerard Houllier’s Treble-winning side that lifted the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup in 2001.

That year he also scored England’s fifth goal in a 5-1 World Cup qualifying win over Germany in Munich. ‘It was a great year and a great time to be playing football,’ he recalls.

Success did not follow quite so easily after that, however. In the next eight years, Heskey scored only 38 goals for Birmingham, Wigan and Aston Villa.

When he retired from international football after the 2010 World Cup, in which he was made the scapegoat for England’s failure under Fabio Capello, he had just seven England goals in 62 games.

His advocates point out that he was a target man who brought out the best from a succession of strike partners including Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney. To others he became a figure of fun. When Heskey scored for Bolton last month, local comic Paddy McGuinness had to make good on a bet and clean the striker’s boots. Even the fans’ version of Walking in a Heskey Wonderland includes the line ‘he used to be s***e but now he’s all right’.

Lennon is not alone in believing that his old friend has a point to prove, but Heskey says his record speaks for itself: ‘Four League Cups, FA Cup, UEFA Cup, Super Cup, Charity Shield, played in two World Cups, two Euros. That’s not bad. I’m happy.

‘If I could have got more goals, I would have loved to. But it never hindered me from achieving and winning trophies.

Heskey revealed he hopes to play for one more year and will enjoy every minute he has left playing

‘Between 2004 and 2008 I didn’t get picked for England. Then I came back at 30 and played until 32. People asked why I was being picked again but managers were picking me and they were happy.’

Heskey still looks in shape but he is reminded that his new Bolton team-mate Zach Clough was born on the same day that he made his Premier League debut for Leicester in 1995.

In the Under 21 trial against Reading, he faced Martin Keown’s son Niall. Did Keown Jnr kick him as well? ‘He tried,’ says Heskey.

‘When I was growing up, everyone was saying that you’re finished at 35. You’ve got that in your mind and when I got to 35, I thought I was finished.

‘But you realise you can play to whatever age you want as long as you change your game and your legs hold out.

‘I’ve seen many players do it. You’ve got Frank Lampard doing it, Didier Drogba, Eidur... Steven Gerrard is 35 in May. Teddy Sheringham played until he was 42. It’s how you live your life.

‘I feel I can play another year. Whether that happens is another thing.’
