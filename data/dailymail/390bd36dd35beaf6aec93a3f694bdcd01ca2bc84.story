An amateur photographer claims is being haunted by a ghost which emits a peculiar smell of fish just before tragedy is about to strike someone she knows.

Laura Dickson, 27, of Sittingbourne, Kent, claims she has smelt the fishy odour on a number of indications before something bad has happened - such as a family friend dying or her grandmother being taken into hospital. 

But rather than fear the spectre, which has stalked her for 10 years, and its distinctive smell Miss Dickson has now come to accept it and takes the aroma as a clear warning to be on her guard.

It also inspired her to become a ghost hunter and she has used her enthusiasm for photography to capture spectres on film - even photographing what she believes is the ghost of a monk in Kent.

Laura Dickson, 27, who has become a ghost hunter, claims she is haunted by a ghost that has a distinctive fishy smell, which appears as a warning before tragedy is about to strike someone she knows 

'The pong always appeared right before something bad happened,' she said.

'Ever since I was little, I've sensed spirits around me. I'd pick up on presences in the room and the fishy smell would come as a warning.'

The ill-scented encounters started when Miss Dickson was around nine or 10 and shortly afterwards a relative was rushed into hospital after suffering a stroke. 

She said: 'In a way, the spirits' whiffy warning had helped prepare me.'

It was this episode which prompted Miss Dickson to work as a ghost hunter – one of the UK's only female stalkers.

'I often visited old buildings to take photos.

Miss Dickson said she believes this picture has captured an image of a ghost of a monk in a church window

'I noticed a number of my pictures were covered in light orbs.

'When I researched it online, I learnt that some people believe it indicates a spirit present in the picture.

'This made me think, 'I'm going to catch more than light orbs'.

'So I continued scouring old buildings, snapping away.'

In January last year Miss Dickson, who works as a machinist, was taking pictures of St Peter and St Paul church in Borden, Kent, when she captured a mysterious image. 

The amateur photographer took up ghost hunting after the 'smelly ghost' seemed to be warning her

Miss Dickson said she picks up presences in a room and the fishy smells then come as a warning to her 

Since starting to hunt for ghosts Miss Dickson has become determined to capture more images of spectres 

She said: 'In one of the pictures, a ghostly figure was standing in the window of the church.

'I glance up and the ghost had disappeared.

'I made my way home and uploaded the pictures onto my laptop.

'As I zoomed into the image I noticed it looked like a monk.

'I did some research and discovered the church was founded by monks hundreds of years ago.

In this photo, taken in 2011, Miss Dickson said there is an image of a girl in top right corner and some orbs

'I realised it must have been haunted by them and I'd caught one on camera.

'I couldn't believe I'd managed it.

'But I know it's a real ghost.

'And it's just made me even more determined to catch spirits on camera.

'I suppose you could call me a real-life ghost hunter.'

And in 2011 Miss Dickson claims she took a photo at Hastings Museum which captured an image of a girl, with orbs in the top right hand corner.
