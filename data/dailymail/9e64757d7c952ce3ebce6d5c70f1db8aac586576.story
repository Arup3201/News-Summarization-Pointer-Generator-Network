Mats Hummels looks set to join Manchester United this week from Borussia Dortmund for a reported £16million, according to reports in Spain.

The two clubs remain locked in talks ahead of the prospective move, but the Old Trafford hierarchy are confident off thrashing out a deal for the highly-rated defender.

The 25-year-old was in impressive form for World Champions Germany during the tournament in Brazil, and that has attracted interest from new United manager Louis van Gaal.

Champions: Mats Hummels played an integral part in Germany's World Cup success

Confident: Van Gaal is looking to build a squad capable of challenging at the very top

That what will come as a huge boost to the 20-times champions as they look to get back on the trophy haul following a disappointing season.

It later emerged that Ed Woodward left Manchester United's tour of the United States for 'general business reasons'.

Less than 24 hours after telling United fans new signings would be coming to Old Trafford this summer, the club's executive vice-chairman decided he would head back to the UK on Monday night.

Woodward left the club's tour last summer because of what was described at the time as 'urgent transfer business'.

But this time, United insist Woodward's departure from the four-match tour is due to 'general business reasons' and is not due to a specific imminent transfer.

With both Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand departing the club this summer, United are in desperate need of some experience at the back and despite being just 25, Hummels will provide just that after playing at the highest level domestically and internationally for many years.

Unless a 
late twist puts the deal into jeopardy, Hummels will join the likes of 
Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera at Old Trafford, as Van Gaal looks to build a
 side capable of challenging for major honours.

Quality: Hummels would be a superb addition to Van Gaal's side

Crucial: Hummels will be sorely missed at Dortmund if he leaves
