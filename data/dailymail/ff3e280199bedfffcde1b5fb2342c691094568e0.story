Kevin De Bruyne's impact at Wolfsburg this season has been such that the midfielder's former club Chelsea are regretting letting him go, according to general manager Klaus Allofs.

The 23-year-old completed a £17million move to the Bundesliga side in January 2014 after concluding that he would not be able to break into the first team at Stamford Bridge.

The Belgium international is enjoying a successful first full season with the Wolves - having currently netted eight league goals as they sit eight points behind league leaders Bayern Munich.

And Allofs believes De Bruyne's midfield prowess is one reason why Chelsea are regretting his departure from west London.

'At Chelsea they watch with appreciation as Kevin has developed,' he told Kicker.

'They've seen it confirmed why they were reluctant to let him leave.'

De Bruyne's spell at Chelsea was rather a frustrating one following his move from Belgian outfit Genk in January 2012 - starting just five matches during his time at the Blues.

During his time at Chelsea, the midfielder was loaned out to Werder Bremen in the 2012/13 season where he scored 10 goals in 34 appearances for them in the Bundesliga.

De Bruyne's limited opportunities at Stamford Bridge mimicked Andre Schurrle's - who left the club for Wolfsburg in a £24m deal on transfer deadline day.

The pair are expected to be in tandem together for their trip to Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday afternoon.
