From her show-stopping wedding gown and the dazzling dresses she wore as she adapted to her role as a royal, to her chic maternity choices while pregnant, the Duchess of Cambridge was the world's favourite style icon. 

But it seems that we've had a change of heart as Cheryl Versini-Fernandez, who has been showcasing her wardrobe choices week after week on the X Factor, has pipped Kate to be crowned the most stylish woman.

In fact, the Duchess, who recently announced she is pregnant with her second child, is nowhere to be seen on the latest best dressed list. 

Britain's new style icon: Cheryl Versini-Fernandez, who has been showcasing her wardrobe choices week after week on the X Factor, has been crowned Britain's most stylish woman

Coming in at a close second after the X-Factor judge is Jennifer Aniston, as the nation celebrates the 20th anniversary of Friends this month and the legacy of that haircut lives on. 

The sophisticated style of Helen Mirren and Yasmin Le Bon has also struck a chord with women up and down the country, as has Victoria Beckham’s elegant look, ahead of her flagship store opening in London this week. 

Other females to make the top ten includes Kelly Brook,  Alexa Chung and even Kate's sister, Pippa Middleton.

Victoria’s husband, the dapper David Beckham, is cited as the top style inspiration for men, pipping the likes of Harry Styles, Bradley Cooper and Pharrell Williams to the post.

Despite eschewing catwalk looks, Britons still look to paparazzi photos, celebrity street style and TV talent for inspiration, with over a third  (37 per cent) admitting that they buy outfits to copy celebrity looks, setting them back an average of £77 per outfit.

Perhaps a result of our celebrity-obsessed culture, young people are the most likely to emulate celebrities with over half of 25-35 year olds (52 per cent) confessing to buying outfits to recreate a look they’ve seen on a famous face.  

With the sun on its way out, and autumn on its way in, the fashion conscious will no doubt be looking to stock their winter wardrobes, with the average Briton set to splash £241 on clothes to keep out the cold.

Retailers will be celebrating the colder climes as 71 per cent of the UK are set to buy a new coat this winter, while 80 per cent will stock up on jumpers, and 66 per cent will treat themselves to a new pair of boots. This compares to just over £100 spent on clothes for the spring/summer months.

Despite the reported rise of the metrosexual male, women still reign supreme on the high street, admitting to spending an average of £430 a year on new clothes and accessories just to stay up to date with the latest trends, compared to just £295 spent by men.  

When it comes to dressing their children, ten per cent of Brits are also looking to celebrity children for inspiration perhaps emulating the fashions of ultra-trendy Harper Beckham, Prince George and North ‘Nori’ West. 

Family style: David Beckham topped the best dressed men's list whilst daughter Harper Seven is inspiring ten per cent of Brits looking to celebrity children for inspiration

Almost half parents aged 18-24 (45 per cent) have looked to celebrity children, whilst almost a third (31 per cent) have sacrificed their own fashion so their children can stay on trend.

A spokesperson for VoucherCodes.co.uk, who commissioned the research, said: 'As the biggest week in fashion draws to a close, it’s interesting to see it’s the wholesome household names rather than the world’s sophisticated supermodels Brits are most likely to turn to for fashion inspiration. 

'Brits are proud of our famous faces so it’s no surprise that a third of us seek to emulate celebrity fashion looks, with the nations’ sweetheart Cheryl Fernandez- Versini and footballing legend Becks named the UK’s top trendsetters.'
