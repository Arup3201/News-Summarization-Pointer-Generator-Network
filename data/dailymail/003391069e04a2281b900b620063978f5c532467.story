The Open Championship at St Andrews next year appeared the perfect place for Greg Norman to wave goodbye, stopping — like the legends before him — on the Swilcan Burn for the obligatory  farewell photo of a lifetime.

But, in news that will come as a bitter disappointment to his vast army of admirers, I can reveal it won’t be happening for the two-time Claret Jug winner, owing to an ugly dispute that reflects badly on the game.

The 59-year-old Aussie great, never one to pull his punches, said: ‘If you want the truth, I’ve played in my last Open and it’s all down to the way the Royal and Ancient and the European Tour have handled my whole situation.

Wrangle: Greg Norman will not play at The Open Championship this year

‘It has left a pretty sour taste in my mouth, a bad feeling after what I have done in the game. I’ve nothing against the R&A and the European Tour but, quite frankly, the way they go about their business is not the way I do it.’ 

What on earth would cause the Shark to bite such lumps out of the two bodies? It all concerns the intense rivalry between watch companies Rolex and Omega, both big players in golf. Such is their competitiveness that Norman, who represents Omega, reckons Rolex kept him out of playing in the pro-am for the Senior British Open — an event they sponsor — in 2012 over a Turnberry course where he had walked away from the field in the Open in 1986 (Rolex deny this).

A month later, Norman was at  Gleneagles and planned to be present to hear his friend, Ryder Cup captain Jose-Maria Olazabal’s wildcards announcement. Again, Rolex were heavily involved and, again, Norman believes he was denied entry.

Now, he says he has had enough. Instead of meeting up with friends in Scotland and Ireland and playing in the Open at Royal Liverpool and the Senior Open at Royal Porthcawl in July, he will retire with his wife Kirsten to his holiday ranch in Colorado.

The big losers in all of this, of course, are the fans. One of the great sights in recent Open history came at Royal Birkdale in 2008 when thousands of people followed the halfway leader Norman on his improbable quest to win a third Claret Jug at the age of 53.

A grand farewell at St Andrews, the last Open for which he will be eligible, appeared ideal. How ironic this act of perfect timing looks like being sabotaged by a watch dispute.

Let’s hope some wise heads at the R&A and the European Tour can resolve it, for Norman’s inestimable contribution to recent Open lore deserves a fitting finale.

In line: Norman is one of the game's greats but will not be at the Open

Putt your money on Bubba & Dustin

Early tips for the Masters, now just three weeks away? You could do worse than have a sneaky pound or two on former winner Bubba Watson and major champion-in-waiting, Dustin Johnson.You’ll know all about their length on an Augusta course offering the big bombers a huge advantage. But how about their ability to cope on those lightning-paced greens?

In waiting: Dustin Johnson could be in line to pick up the green jacket in three weeks' time

Job done: Bubba Watson won the tournament back in 2012 and will be gunning for another one

Well, the two men who currently stand miles clear of the rest on the PGA Tour this year when it comes to the longest streaks without a three-putt, at 237 and 217 holes respectively, just happen to be Watson and Johnson.

‘It feels good to win again after seven years. A lot of good things are going to follow.’ 

Australian John Senden had to end a victory drought going back to 2006  to make it to the Masters and that’s exactly what he did on Sunday, holding off the likes of Luke Donald to win the latest event on the Florida swing.

How many players win professional events at the age of 17? Matteo Manassero is the only one to have done so on the European Tour and did it twice for good measure.

Ryo Ishikawa achieved similar things in Japan and then there’s the extraordinary New Zealander Lydia Ko, who broke all records in winning at the age of only 15.

This, therefore, is the company of prodigies English starlet Charley Hull is keeping with her maiden success on the Ladies European Tour on Sunday.

Hull shot 62 in the final round of 
the Lalla Meryem Cup in Morocco, to catch the experienced French player 
Gwladys Nocera, and then birdied the first extra hole to beat her in the
 play-off.

Sealed with a kiss: Matteo Manassero won the Castellon Masters Costa Azahar in 2010

Record breaker: New Zealander Lydia Ko with the New Zealand Women's Golf Open trophy

Star quality: Charley Hull won the Lalla Meryem Cup in Morocco this month

The Woburn starlet will celebrate her 18th on Thursday, having rounded off a memorable year that saw her turn pro and promptly finish runner-up in each of her first five starts. She then became the youngest participant to compete in the Solheim Cup last August, where she proved one of the stars of Europe’s historic first success on American soil.

With an historic Olympics not far away and so much more, what wonders the photogenic Hull is going to do for women’s golf in the UK.
