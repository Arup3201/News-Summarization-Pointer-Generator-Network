Millionaire businessman Jeremy Paxton has had a ruling banning him from using a rotating helipad in his garden overturned

A millionaire water ski champion is to be allowed to use a rotating helicopter landing pad in his garden after overturning a council ban.

Businessman Jeremy Paxton was furious when Reading Councillors ruled that he could not use the pad in the grounds of his mansion to protect a nearby willow tree and prevent noise and pollution irritating his neighbours.

Mr Paxton, who became Britain's first private airborne Fire Ranger last year after volunteering with Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service, said that the ban had left him unable to do anything with the pad other than play table tennis on it, dine on it and use it for 'recreational sumo wrestling'.

Taxpayers will now have to foot the bill for Reading Borough Council's legal costs and Mr Paxton's own Â£30,000 expenses after the ruling was overturned on appeal.

The pilot built the revolving pad, which is covered with turf, in the grounds of his luxury home situated on the bank of the River Thames in Caversham, Berkshire, so that he could take off into the wind, but did so without planning permission and had to apply to the council retrospectively.

He was granted permission by the authority's planning committee but it said that he could not use the turntable for his chopper in case a protected willow tree was damaged.

Mr Paxton said: 'It seems bonkers that I can land anywhere I like in my garden, but the council wants to say I cannot land on a flush mounted turntable that allows the helicopter to be swung around.

'The council says that landing on the turntable might damage the a tree, but I could land on that spot if the turntable was not there.

'Would I really want to land too close to a tree in a helicopter?

'It all seems daft and childish nonsense to me and yet another appeal to waste public funds.'

In his decision report planning inspector Peter Bird described the ban as 'unnecessary', 'perverse' and 'unreasonable'.

Mr Bird pointed out the Mr Paxton has permission from the Civil Aviation Authority to take off or land at his property up to 14 times a week.

Mr Paxton, said that this is the third planning appeal he has lodged against Reading Borough Council

Mr Paxton insisted his immediate neighbours do not have a problem with the helicopter.

He said he does not fly it early in the morning or late at night and only uses around half of the permitted take-offs and landings.

The millionaire, who owns the Lower Mill Estate of luxury homes in the Cotswolds and often commutes to work in his executive Mcdonnell Douglas 500e helicopter, said: 'It's a great shame, this is the third appeal in two years they have put me through for applications that really are so benign.

'The first was for solar panels, and we again won costs, and the second was for some gates. The thing I find most galling is it's such a waste of public money and I don't get all the money.'

Planning committee chairman Pete Ruhemann said: 'There have been particular problems on this site with retrospective applications, the planning application only coming in after development has been completed.

'I would urge Mr Paxton to do as other land-owners do and discuss what he wants to do with planning officers before submitting an application, and then doing the work if and when that application was approved. That would generate real savings both for himself and for the council.'

The rotating helipad is in the grounds of Mr Paxton's Caversham home, situated on the banks of the River Thames in Berkshire, which he calls Ballihoo
