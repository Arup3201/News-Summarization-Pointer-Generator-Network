This shocking image shows the moment a woman 'suicide bomber' killed six people on a Russian bus, less than four months before the country hosts the 2014 Winter Olympics.

The attacker was named as Naida Asiyalova, 30, from the volatile region of Dagestan. The picture is taken from footage captured on a dashboard camera of a car driving behind the bus.

Some reports say Asiyalova was ill with a serious and possibly terminal bone disease.

Atrocity: A dashboard camera captures the moment a female suicide bomber explodes on a bus in Volgograd, killing six

Naida Asiyalova was alleged to be the spouse of a 21 year old rebel commander named Dmitry 'Giraffe' Sokolov and to have recently adopted Islam

She is from the North Caucasus, a region 
in southern Russia where an Islamic insurgency has been simmering for 
more than a decade following two separatist wars in Chechnya.

Asiyalova was also alleged to be the spouse of a 21 year old rebel commander named Dmitry 'Giraffe' Sokolov and to have recently adopted Islam.

The bombing in Volgograd - formerly Stalingrad - at 2pm today led to more than 30 injuries, with at least half a dozen maimed.

It is the worst atrocity for three years in a region where Islamic extremists are active.

'According to preliminary information, a native of Dagestan, 30-year-old Naida Asiyalova, blew herself up,' said a statement from Russian investigators.

'She boarded the bus at one of the bus stops and an explosion took place almost immediately afterwards.'

Earlier reports claimed she was the widow of a slain commander but it was later clarified that her husband remains alive and wanted by the Russian authorities.

Female suicide bombers are dubbed 'black widows' in 
Russia because their male relatives have often been killed by security 
forces.Â 

Sokolov - from Siberia - is said to have 
adopted Wahhabism in 2010 and to have fitted a suicide belt to another 
female killer in Makhachkala, the Dagestan capital.

He secretly wed Asiyalova in Moscow, it was reported.

The green and white city bus was left mangled on the street after the explosion.

Many of the passengers were students.

'It was a powerful explosion - a huge blast,' said a father called Vladimir who rescued his daughter from the carnage.

'The bus was torn to pieces. When I came to pick her up, half the bus was simply not there.'

- An eyewitness

Vladimir Markin, spokesman for the Investigative Committee, a Russian federal police agency, said: 'Six dead people have been found, as well as the body of the suicide bomber.'

Some 28 were in hospital with eight in a grave condition.

A resident called Ilya said: 'I saw a woman sitting inside the bus. She was covered with blood and I couldn't make out whether she was alive or not.

'She was just sitting there.'

Dramatic footage from a dashboard camera in a nearby car showed the explosion ripping through the bus on a tree-lined road, sending shards of metal and glass flying.

Passengers scrambled out of doors and windows after the bus had stopped.

'There was a blast - a bang - all the glass flew out of the windows,' said eyewitness Ivan.

'I saw people start to fall out and run out to escape the bus. It was a horrible sight.'

Russian president Vladimir Putin has already ordered a security clampdown for the Winter Olympics which will be held around 500 miles from the blast scene in Sochi.

Previous female suicide bomber attacks saw 37 people at a Moscow airport in 2011 and twin suicide bombings that killed 40 people on the Moscow subway in 2010.

In 2002, Chechen women wearing black chadors and suicide belts also took part in a three-day Moscow theatre hostage siege in which around 130 people were killed.
