Now the payroll tax debate is coming to a close, the White House has also cleared up an even bigger question occupying Washington's elite.

Barack Obama's dog Bo did NOT fly back just days after his Hawaiian holiday began so he could take part in a presidential photo call.

Rumours abounded that Bo had flown out to Hawaii on Saturday with the First Family then returned to Washington D.C. for the Wednesday photos.

Michelle Obama’s press office had 
earlier said Bo would be leaving with the First Lady and her girls for 
their Hawaii holiday last Saturday.

And an island eyewitness said he saw 
the Portuguese Water Dog taken for a walk earlier this week, ahead of 
President Obama’s delayed arrival.

But now the White House has told the 
Honolulu Star-Advertiser that Bo has been in Washington all along 
and never left for Hawaii in the first place.

Eyewitness Scott Miscovich blamed the 
sighting on his wife, whom he said must have seen ‘another black dog 
walking our neighborhood’.

told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser: ‘We would like to apologise to Bo and 
the Obama family for any inconvenience this may have caused them.'

The same newspaper had reported earlier this week that ‘the family and first dog Bo arrived at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam’.

The White House Dossier blog 
speculated Bo could have come back on the plane that first took Mrs
Obama out to Hawaii on Saturday.

The bill for the $4million trip rose 
by $100,000 when Mrs Obama decided to take Sasha and Malia early while 
her husband sorts out the economy.

The National Enquirer even reported Bo
is flown to holidays on a separate plane with Secret Service agents, 
but this was never verified.

President Obama took Bo on a shopping 
trip to PetSmart on Wednesday where he bought two items including a dog 
bone with a $50 bill.

The First Family will return home on 
January 1. It is not yet known whether Bo will go with President Obama 
when he flies out to Hawaii.

They are covering the cost of a 
private beach front residence in Kailua, Oahu, which costs up to $3,500 a
day, or $75,000 a month.
