Missing: Lindsey McNamara, 24, from Ashland, Massachusetts, who was last seen on Valentine's Day having dinner with two others at the Natick Mall

The star of a notorious pork-throwing incident at a police station that went viral after CCTV footage was released has been reported missing.

Lindsey McNamara was arrested at a police station in Framingham, Massachusetts, in December after hurling pounds of bacon and sausages at the receptionists' window while shouting, 'It's time to feed the pigs'.

The 24-year-old nursing student has not been seen since Valentine's Day. Police told CBS News they are actively investigating her disappearance, but have learned nothing to indicate foul play. 

Miss McNamara was last seen at dinner with acquaintances at PF Chang's, a Chinese restaurant at the Natick Mall, on February 14, said Ashland police spokesman Lieutenant Richard Briggs.

Her cell phone also pinged in the area. An Ashland PD statement said: 'We are actively investigating this and any assistance from the public would be appreciated.'

Miss McNamara's disappearance comes days after a judge dismissed a charge against her relating to a bizarre bacon-throwing incident that made her an unwitting Internet star.

In replies to an appeal on the Ashland PD Facebook page for information on her whereabouts a woman who identifies herself as Miss McNamara's aunt says she thought 'someone was out to get her.'

'She stated this at her court appearance,' wrote Denise McNamara Fitzgerald, also noting that her niece 'appeared to be doing better on her medication'.

'She is my niece and has always (until [the pork-throwing] incident) been a beautiful, intelligent woman..with goals,' Denise McNamara Fitzgerald added. 

'We are all just praying for her sa[f]e return, regardless of any prev problems.'

Miss McNamara has blue eyes and brown hair. Her family do not recognise the man and woman she was having dinner with on Saturday night, CBS Boston reported.

Impulsive: Video shows 24-year-old Lindsey McNamara walking into Framingham Police Department in Massachusetts at around 11am on December 26 with a Dunkin' Donuts box

'Feed the pigs': She opens the cardboard container to reveal pounds of raw rashers of bacon and sausages. She then starts hurling them at the receptionist's bulletproof window

Hurling insults: The video has no sound, but according to police, McNamara shouted 'it’s time to feed the pigs' as she threw the food. Police said she later told them that God had told her to do it

Captured for posterity: A bystander whips out his phone to take a picture as McNamara is led away 

Surveillance camera footage that went viral last month showed Miss McNamara walking into Framingham Police Department at around 11am on December 26, dressed in pyjamas and carrying a Dunkin' Donuts box.

She opens the cardboard container to reveal pounds of raw sausages and bacon rashers, which she starts hurling at the receptionist's bulletproof window.

The video has no sound but according to police, Miss McNamara, who is from Ashland, shouted 'it’s time to feed the pigs' as she threw the raw meat.

As the camera continues to roll, two police officers enter the scene and Miss McNamara drops the box before being handcuffed and swiftly taken away - but not before an astonished bystander whips out his phone for a cheeeky photo.

Police said she told them: 'God told me to go feed the pigs.'

Aftermath: The raw meat left on the police station counter after McNamara's episode. She was charged with malicious destruction of property under $250 and disorderly conduct

Hearing: A judge dismissed the malicious destruction of property charge but ordered her to pay $150 costs on the disorderly conduct charge. She reportedly told the judge she thought someone was out to get her

A judge on Thursday dismissed a charge of malicious destruction of property against Miss McNamara, CBS Boston reported. 

She was ordered to pay $150 court costs on a charge of disorderly conduct after earlier being ordered to have a psychiatric evaluation. 

Regina McNamara, McNamara's mother, told reporters that her daughter was going through a 'difficult time' when the incident occurred.
