An Oregon teen who is too young to gamble in Las Vegas isn't being allowed to bring a showgirl to prom because his school says she is too old to attend.

Austin Moore, 17, asked Mariah Rivera to prom over Instagram. 

Moore, a junior at Regis High School in Stayton, had a slight in with Rivera because she is a cousin of one of his friends.

Austin Moore of Stayton, Oregon, asked Las Vegas showgirl Mariah Rivera to prom over Instagram

She said that she would attend the dance at Regis High School in May if he could get 10,000 retweets

Moore has been doing his due diligence to get the required number of tweets and is closing in on 1,400

In addition to working as a topless 'Fantasy' dancer at the Luxor on the Strip, Rivera also dances as a Las Vegas Outlaws cheerleader.

After Moore made his request on social media. Rivera got back to him about a week later and said if he was able to get 10,000 retweets she would be part of his prom group, KGW reported. 

The retweets started coming fast and furious - they are at nearly 1,400 - and Moore's quest began to draw attention. 

However, even if Moore reaches 10,000 retweets, Rivera won't be attending the dance on May 16 because the Catholic school won't let her.

Regis High School Principal Scott Coulter said: 'All prom guests have to be 19 and under.

'Austin's not in trouble.

'We just laughed about it and I said this just isn't going to happen.'

In addition to ending up on a variety of media sites because of the prom, Rivera has also drawn attention for this

Moore's friends were 'pretty bummed' to find out Rivera wasn't coming, Oregon Live reported. 

He said: 'They all really wanted a model in the group.'

Things aren't that bad for Moore as he has a girlfriend he always intended to bring as his date. 

Rivera, who is married, told The Las Vegas Sun that Moore's request was 'all in good fun' and 'strictly PG'.

She said: 'It’s very flattering, although a little embarrassing.

'My other Fantasy dancers are having some fun over this, but I think it’s because they are a little jealous they didn’t get an invitation. 

'Maybe I’ll take them along with me.'

Unfortunately for Moore and his friends, It doesn't sound like the school will let that happen.
