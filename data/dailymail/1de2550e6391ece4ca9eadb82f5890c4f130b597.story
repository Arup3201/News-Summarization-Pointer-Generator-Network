While many have not been aware of the decade-long tradition at Delta Airlines, a heart-warming video shows one of the tributes performed by bag handlers as a fallen soldier and his dog are returned home.

As the unidentified K9 soldier's flag-draped casket is taken off a plane at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Delta staff are seen standing as they salute  on the tarmac during the ceremony.

In the video, which was originally posted in April 2013, but has resurfaced touching many hearts, a smaller casket is also shown as the military animal is honored during the tribute.

While many have not been aware of the decade-long tradition at Delta Airlines, a heart-warming video shows one of the tributes performed by bag handlers as a fallen soldier and his dog are returned home (above scenes from the tribute in 2013 at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport)

The soldier and his bomb-sniffing dog were reportedly killed by an improvised explosive device, and the staff, both carefully handling their caskets and saluting, are a group of volunteers from the Delta Honor Guard service.

During the moving February 2013 ceremony for the K9 soldier and his military dog, bag handlers are lined up holding flags behind the carrier transporting the caskets from the belly of the plane.

There are flags represented for each branch of service as well as an American flag in the center, which are held at a 45 degree angle as the caskets emerge and are lowered, and a prayer is read before they are physically moved to a special flag-painted cart by the staff.

Several other staff are seen observing the ceremony nearby during the rainy day, as travelers are seen in windows above filming and observing as well.

Two military personnel and what appears to be two Delta pilots then shake the hands of each flag holder before the touching tribute ends.

Ceremonies like this are held by volunteers for veterans and active military personnel who were killed in action, according to an earlier report from the AJC.

In 2010, it was reported that five to six ceremonies were held each week on both departing and arriving flights after a former Delta bag handler and military veteran, Thomas Schenk, started the effort in 2005.

Brian McConnell, a 32-year Delta employee who has been involved with the Honor Guard service since 2006, took over the coordination of the ceremonies in 2008.

While McConnell is not a veteran himself, his father was one and his son served in the Air Force in Afghanistan - so his involvement in the service, for this and among other reasons, is meaningful to him.

The women and men of the employee-led Honor Guard, with several having served in the Armed Forces, have helped transport home more than 3,000 remains through Atlanta's airport, McConnell said in a report last year.

He said: 'For nearly a decade, I've stood alongside a dedicated group of Delta Air Lines volunteers rain or shine to pay respects to our nation's fallen heroes as they transit through the world's busiest airport. 

'As a member of the Delta Honor Guard, we take great pride in the humbling task of making sure the remains of these military fallen are well cared for as they make their way home.'

McConnell added: 'It’s a sobering experience to stand in tribute while customers on board the airplane and in the terminal as well as the family and escort look on, but it’s our way of serving our country and ensuring our heroes are well cared for on their journey home.'

The Honor Guard service has grown to include the cities of Minneapolis, Detroit, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.
