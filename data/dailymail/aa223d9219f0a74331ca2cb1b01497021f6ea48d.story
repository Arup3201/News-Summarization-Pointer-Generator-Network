A teenage girl pulled off a feat most professional golfers can only dream off when she hit two holes in one during a single competition.

Samantha Staudt, 16, was playing in a high school competition at the Inniscrone Golf Club in Avondale, Pennsylvania, when she hit the first hole-in-one on the fifth hole.

The Coatsville Area High School junior, who has  never hit a hole in one before, told ABC6: 'I just hit it and it happened to be right at the pole and hit and spun and rolled three feet into the pole.'

Samantha continued the round playing against a boy from Avon Grove, but was confused when she couldn't find her ball on the eighth green.

She said: 'I went up there and I didn't see anything. I guess it rolled off the front and I didn't see it. 

'Then the guy from Avon Grove [High School] went up and looked in the cup and said, 'How am I supposed to compete with this? This is ridiculous!'''

Unsurprisingly, the 16-year-old won the nine-hole round, finishing at 1-under-par 35. 

Samantha had never hit a hole in one until that day, when she hit two in the same round

'I didn't even know what to do,' Samantha told philly.com. 'On the first one, we were going crazy, but I've never heard of anyone having two in one round.'

She said that she didn't celebrate with her parents that night but she added: 'My parents are joking around about buying me a lottery ticket.'

Samantha proudly posted a picture of her impressive scorecard on her Twitter account, writing that it was the 'craziest thing I ever did'.
