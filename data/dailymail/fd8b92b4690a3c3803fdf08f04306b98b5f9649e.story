With Benfica holding a fragile 1-0 lead over Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League, it was not the time for any  player from the Portuguese side to try anything flamboyant in front of goal.

Unfortunately, that is exactly what Romario Balde did when he seized control of a penalty for his side.

Instead of lashing the ball into a corner and hoping his accuracy beat the dive of the goalkeeper, he tried to chip the ball down the middle and into the goal - a panenka penalty kick. 

Romario Balde chips a penalty at goal in Benfica's UEFA Youth League game against Shakhtar Donetsk

Balde's contact with the ball was so light it only trickled to goal, despite the goalkeeper diving the wrong way

The goalkeeper had enough time to get to his feet and  save the attempt, so minimal was Balde's contact

Balde wa substituted and his Benfica side  drew to Shakhtar 1-1 before losing the game on penalties

The skill is named after Antonin Panenka's penalty at Euro 1976 for Czechoslovakia against Germany but Balde lacked all of the conviction that made Panenka's kick famous.

His kick was so feeble and light that the Shakhtar goalkeeper had enough time to dive the wrong way, regain his balance and  claim the ball before it trickled over the line.

And things did not get any better for Balde or Benfica.

Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo famously scored a panenka penalty against England at Euro 2012

He was substituted, Benfica ended up drawing 1-1 before crashing out of the competition - on penalties. 

The panenka has been replicated by the likes of Andrea Pirlo and Zinedine Zidane, but Balde is unlikely to want to try it in an important game any time soon.
