With her long blonde hair and healthy tan Carolyn Still wouldn't look out of place in Footballers' Wives.

So it is little wonder that the 29-year-old is causing a stir in the real world of football.

But she is not the latest squeeze of some millionaire Premier League star - the politics graduate has become the the youngest CEO in English 
football after being appointed to the board of Mansfield Town.

Youth beauty AND experience: At 29 years old, Ms Still becomes the youngest in the country to hold such a high role in football

Young, 
female and attractive, Carolyn Still - former high flyer in the luxury fashion industry
and now brand new chief executive of the Nottinghamshire club - is a 
rare breed in the male-dominated world of football.

But
armed with a knowledge of business acquired in the cut-throat fashion 
industry, Still is adamant she is more than woman enough to fill the 
role.

Still, who has 
held executive roles at luxury brands Gucci and Bulgari, says she will 
draw on her fashion past to improve the fortunes of the club. 

'Working in that industry I've absorbed a lot of useful information,' she says.

'Strategies can be utilised from fashion to football. It's business at the end of the day.'

On the ball: Karren Brady was just 23 when she was appointed managing director at Birmingham City

'It's a great privilege for me to be 
offered the chance to lead this football club,' said Miss Still on her 
appointment. 'I intend to add vibrancy and fresh ideas to our approach 
off the field.'

Miss
Still has promised to do her best to bring success back to the Blue 
Square Premier team, whose 77-year stay in the Football League came to 
an end in 2008.

'I want to wake sleeping fans with a lot of different initiatives by liaising with them and finding what they want,' she said.

She added: 'We have a fantastic team both on and
off the field and I am pleased to accept this role during a time when 
there appears to be a real buzz around the place.'

Unsurprisingly, her appointment has been compared to that of West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady, who at the age of 23 was made 
managing director of Birmingham City Football Club.

'I do see a correlation,' says Still. 'Karren is steely, determined and, at
the end of the day, she turned around a football club that wasn't doing
very well that is now doing extremely well.

In her wisdom, Still admits
that although her business acumen landed her the job, an unusual 
appointment - in this case, of a young, attractive woman to a top-flight
football position - is nevertheless a shrewd one.

'There's no doubt that having a 
29-year-old female in the 
role will attract publicity to the club,' she says. But as Still says, 
that female has to have the brains to back up the beauty.

'Essentially, she had the business 
brain behind it,' Still says of Brady.

'She had the statistics, the 
enthusiasm - and that's very important within every business 
environment.'

'It's about being positive, streamlining. I've got passion and enthusiasm.

'I'm going to observe and listen, and make the most out of the club's resources.

'I'm
taking my knowledge of business and I'll implement changes. You have to
move on and change everything - from IT to catering. 

'We can't do the status quo any more.'
