Kevin Grosskreutz has hit the headlines again in Germany after he was caught urinating in the lobby of a hotel.

The Borussia Dortmund defender was spotted relieving himself just hours after his side had lost to arch rivals Bayern Munich 2-0 in the German Cup final on May 17.

The 25-year-old reportedly urinated in 
the lobby of the Hotel Berlin at 6am after going out to the city's 
Kraftwerk night club, before involving himself in a rowdy dispute with 
one of the guests staying at the resort.

Sheepish look: Grosskreutz has since apologised for the incident at the Hotel Berlin on May 18

Eyewitnesses say that police were called to the scene but the player had gone by the time he had arrived.

Grosskreutz has since apologised for the incident. 'I was totally frustrated after the game,' he said. 

'We had planned so much and really wanted to win the trophy. I had a blackout. I am sorry.’
