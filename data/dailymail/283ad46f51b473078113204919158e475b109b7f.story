As a contender for Prime Minister, Ed Miliband’s comparison to the dopey Plasticine model Wallace is one he has always endeavoured to distance himself from.

But doing so may prove easier said than done, because Aardman Animations – creators of Wallace and Gromit – have been rather mischievous in their latest film and included a character which bears an uncanny resemblance to the Labour leader.

The advert trailer for Aardman’s latest Plasticine stop-animation children’s film Shaun the Sheep reveals a displeased waiter character with more than a passing likeness to Mr Miliband.

The Wallace comparison has been a thorn in the side of Mr Miliband, who for years has fought to shake off the caricature, and with just under 100 days until election day, the film’s release next month is less than timely.

Last year in a speech to launch Labour’s summer campaigning Mr Miliband even admitted the resemblance and said: ‘I am not from central casting. 

'You can find people who are more square-jawed, more chiselled, look less like Wallace’.

And in 2012 he told described himself as ‘somebody who looks a bit like Wallace from Wallace and Gromit’, before adding: ‘If spin doctors could design a politician, I suspect he wouldn’t look like me.’

It is an open secret in Westminster that Mr Miliband is worried about his poor public image – enough so to have hired help from a world renowned autism expert and a voice coach

Likening Mr Miliband to Wallace is an easy dig for the Tories, and during the Autumn Statement last year George Osborne took at swipe at Mr Miliband while explaining details of a tax credit for children’s television and animation production.

He said: ‘The man behind Wallace’s voice has retired. But after next May I am sure the whole House will unite behind a suitable and, by then, available candidate’. 

On the BBC Andrew Marr Show last year the Labour party leader was excruciatingly handed pictures of himself as an Aardman caricature, and he sought to laugh it off, telling the presenter: ‘I didn’t realise you were going to bring me present, that’s incredibly kind. I will show it to my kids.’ 

He went on to say that photo opportunities and charisma weren’t as important as raw policy, but Mr Marr told him: ‘You may hate it, you may think it is trivial, you may think it is awful, but it’s how things are done now. 

‘Just as how in the Victorian period you had to stand up and make a three-hour speech in front of 300 people, now you have to do photo opportunities and deal with the internet and memes and so forth. 

‘Therefore it is the job, it is the duty of a political leader to be better at it that you have been. It is not enough to say “it doesn’t matter”. It does matter. It’s the way things are done.’
