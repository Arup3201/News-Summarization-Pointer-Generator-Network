With Ann Curry’s days as a Today show co-host numbered, it has been revealed that NBC will pony up the dough - $10million in total - just to cut her loose.

Curry, 55, returned to the venerable news programme again this morning, days after rumours of her imminent departure first began to swirl.

It is believed that Curry will make the exit this week, but it won’t come cheap for NBC.

Brave face: Ann Curry resumed her co-hosting duties on Monday, despite reports that she is being pushed out of the job - a move which will cost NBC $10miilion

The New York Post reported that Curry is in the midst of a three-year, $20million contract that she signed last year - a deal which guarantees her $10million in her final year.

Co-host Matt Lauer, the highest paid TV newsman, makes about $25million a year after signing an epic deal in March to stay with the show.

Despite the Today show firing, Curry won’t be booted from 30 Rock completely, as Curry is expected to be transferred back to her original love of foreign reporting  for the network.

Reports surfaced late Wednesday that Curry, who took over the anchor chair June 9, 2011, would be removed from her spot as Matt Lauer's co-host before the network's Olympic coverage begins next month.

The gossip hasn't intimidated Curry, who has continued coming to work, keeping a brave face amid the tension. This morning was no different.

Conan O'Brien: When Tonight show ratings took a dip after Conan O’Brien took over hosting duties from Jay Leno, the ginger-haired funnyman was offered $45million to step aside for Leno's return. O’Brien also fought for - and won - his staff, many of whom  had uprooted their lives in New York to follow O'Brien to California.

Matt Lauer: He was already the highest paid newsman when he was offered an $8million raise to stay on as host of the Today show. He now makes about $25million a year.

Ann Curry: She's on her way out due to her lack of chemistry with Lauer. But NBC will reportedly have to pay her the $10million her contract guarantees in her final year.

Keith Olbermann: It could be a huge payout for the former news host, who was fired from Al Gore’s Current TV in April. He claims the network still owes him about $70million – and he's suing to get it. Current has filed a counter suit.

Piers Morgan: Taking over for a television icon like Larry King is a tough job, and the paycheck shows it. Morgan takes home roughly $2million a year - about a third of what his predecessor made doing Larry King Live.

Both Curry and the network remain mum on the subject.

Curry has taken the blame from many at NBC for the Today show's ratings decline.

The program lost the top spot among network morning shows this spring, a position it had held, unbroken, since 1995.

Part of the problem is a lack of 
chemistry with Lauer, who had great on-air chemistry with Curry's 
predecessors Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira.

It
is making for another awkward transition at a network that prides 
itself on smooth ones, recalling the memorable few weeks shortly before 
Conan O'Brien was booted as host of the Tonight show in favour of Jay 
Leno’s return.

When she appeared on the air Thursday, Curry had one apparently unintentional indignity piled on.

She was on camera at one point when a graphic flashed beneath her face that read: 'Here Today, Gone Tomorrow.'

But that same day, Today had its 
biggest audience of the week, just under 4.5 million, and its biggest 
margin of victory over Good Morning America, according to preliminary 
ratings by the Nielsen Co.

Meanwhile,
the Ladies' Home Journal released excerpts of an interview Curry had 
conducted earlier for the magazine's August cover story, where she said 
it was hard not to take it personally when questions about her 
performance surfaced during this spring's ratings competition with ABC.

Good Morning America in April ended a Today winning streak in the ratings that stretched back to 1995 and has won three other weeks since.

'You worry, am I not good enough?' Curry told the magazine. 'Am I not what people need? Am I asking the right questions. When people say negative things or speculate, you can't help but feel hurt.'

She said she'd love to be on 'Today' for 20 years. She started as a news anchor in 1997.
