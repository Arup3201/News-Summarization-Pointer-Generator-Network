The Union flag was flying over Belfast City Hall this morning to mark the Duchess of Cambridge's birthdayÂ  - but more violent protests are expected this evening when it is taken down.

Loyalists pelted police with bottles and
 stones in a new outbreak of trouble in east Belfast last night over the decision to only raise the flag on 18 
designated days a year.

The continuing violence came amid 
warnings that potential investors are turning away from the city because of the street
 violence.

Riot police faced 
hundreds of masked men last night around the lower Newtownards Road area - showing there is 
no sign of a halt to the protests.

Fireworks,
 rocks, golf balls and petrol bombs were fired at police lines on the 
sixth consecutive night of violence in the confined flashpoint area of 
east Belfast.

A special meeting of unionist 
representatives in Northern Ireland has now been called in a bid to end 
loyalist unrest over the decision.

Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson confirmed that representatives of the various unionist parties will meet at Stormont tomorrow to discuss the trouble.

But leaders centrally involved in the 
protests who are threatening to take their campaign on to the streets of
 Dublin on Saturday have pledged they want no part in the discussions.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) claimed jobs would be lost and shops shut unless there is an immediate end to the trouble.

CBI Northern Ireland director Nigel Smyth warned: 'We are already aware of investors who have lost interest because of these disruptions.'

The unrest has continued intermittently since Belfast City Council's decision last month to reduce the number of days the flag flies to 18 days. A total of 66 officers have been hurt and 104 arrests made since the protests started a month ago.

Businesses, especially restaurant owners, said the disruption has had a disastrous impact on trade.
