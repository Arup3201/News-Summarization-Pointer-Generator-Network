A mass brawl involving patients, visitors and doctors broke out in a Chinese hospital after a new mother was refused porridge.

An hour after Jiang Li Feng, 25, had been given a Caesarean section, she complained that she was hungry. 

She told staff nurse Shi Ying, 27, to fetch her some porridge at the hospital in Dongning county, in north-eastern China's Heilongjiang province. 

But her hunger quickly turned to anger when the nurse explained that it would be dangerous for her to eat anything and she should drink some water instead.

CCTV captured a mass brawl that broke out in a Chinese hospital after a new mother was denied porridge

After a nurse told the new mother she could only drink water, her family members attacked the nurse 

The disagreement turned into a punch-up when the new mother's family, who had gone to celebrate the birth, heard Ms Jiang screaming abuse at the nurse and attacked her. 

Captured on hospital CCTV, the brawl is seen spilling out into the corridor as doctors and the woman's family attack each other.

Nurses are seen trying to break it up to no avail - but police later arrived to arrest nine people and caution the mother.

Visitor Kuan-Yin Sun, 27, said: 'I'd gone to see my sister who was having a baby when I entered the corridor in the maternity ward and saw all these people fighting.

'It was like something out of a film.

'Then some other visitors ran by me and joined in.

'I don't know who was on whose side as they all seemed to be hitting each other.'

As the fighting continued, staff called police who arrived minutes later to break it up.

A police spokesman said: 'Nine people were arrested and the nurse was treated for bruising.

'The new mother was cautioned.'
