A New Zealand woman is still coming to terms with the horrifying moment she was forced to hide in fear of her life from gunman Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in California on Friday night in a rampage just 100 metres from her home.

Amelia Lyons, originally from Napier but based in Santa Barbara, said she got home from work at about 9.30pm and was walking home from a shop when a police officer with his gun out shouted 'get inside, take cover, there's a shooter', reported Stuff.co.nz.

'Obviously hearing that was very freaky,' she said and added as she ran home people on the street were shouting 'get inside'.

Ms Lyons and her boyfriend ran into their house and hid for about 10 minutes while Rodge went on shooting spree.

With police flocking to the area, Ms Lyons said the situation seem a little safer at that time.

'They (the police) were kind of running around... with huge semiautomatic rifles with them, handguns - very kind of foreign scenes to someone from New Zealand obviously where that just kind of does not happen,' she said.

Ms Lyons added that the shooting had sent shockwaves through the town Isla Vista, where the attacks took place.

With the town situated next to UC Santa Barbara campus, there is a high student population and Ms Lyons said many young students looked forward to a bright future. 'This kind of thing does not happen,' she said.

In Rodger's shooting spree, Ms Lyons said her neighbour's friend was shot.

'The guy (victim)... he got shot in the testicle and in the leg, but from what I saw he was like seemingly stable when he was being taking out by the paramedics,' she said.

Ms Lyons said the were nine shooting scenes and described it as 'crazy'.

'Its hard to believe that your doorstep, this kind of thing goes on,' she said.

In the aftermath of the shooting, the young woman said there was some miscommunication of information, and she had been told there were two suspects and one person dead.

On waking to news that six people had been killed, Ms Lyons said it was 'bewildering' and that Rodger had got about 100 metres from her house.

As the town comes to grips with the shocking tragedy, Ms Lyons said the mood was particularly 'sombre' as the normally upbeat town had been left hurting.

'The only topic of conversation obviously is last night - people calling their parents and reassuring them that they're OK... and people are starting to go to the sites of where stuff happened to... let it sink in that it actually did happen hear and to pay their respects,' she said.

The deadly crime spree started with three stabbing deaths inside Rodger's apartment and concluded with him shooting himself in the head.

Rodger, 22, started out by stabbing to death three men around 9.30pm on Friday night. The rampage covered a wide area in the vicinity of the UCSB campus with 10 separate crime scenes.Â 

Rodger, the son of The Hunger Games assistant director Peter Rodger, was driving a black BMW and acted alone when six people were killed and 13 were hurt.

Dr Stephen Kaminski, trauma services director for Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, said of 11 of the wounded that four had been treated and released, and seven transferred to Cottage Hospital.

Of those seven, two were in good condition, three fair and two serious.

Among the six killed by Rodger are female victims Katie Cooper and Veronika Weiss, who are believed to have been slain not far from the University of California Santa Barbara campus.

Chris Martinez, 20, a sophomore at UCSB majoring in English, has been identified as a third victim.
