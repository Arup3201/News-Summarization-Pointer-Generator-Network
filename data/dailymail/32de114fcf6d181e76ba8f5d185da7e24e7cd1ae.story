The widow of a TV executive who was killed in a speedboat crash has had her leg amputated below the knee, it emerged today.

Nick and Victoria Milligan were on a Bank Holiday weekend away in Padstow, Cornwall with their four children when their boat ran out of control, throwing them into the water and running them over with its propellor.

A report into the accident found that the boat's 'kill cord' was not attached to the driver, possibly costing the lives of Sky TV boss Mr Milligan, 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily.

Mrs Milligan, 39, and the couple's four-year-old son both suffered 'life-changing injuries' in the accident, and the family has now confirmed that the former yoga teacher has lost her leg.

The two other children, Amber, 12, and Olivia, 10, escaped with 
minor injuries after eyewitness Charlie Toogood jumped on to the 
boat and cut the engine.

A family statement said: 'All family 
members have now left Derriford Hospital. Amber and Olivia have been 
discharged while Victoria and Kit have been transferred to a London 
hospital.

'Victoria's left leg has been amputated below the knee. Kit is responding well to treatment but both require further surgery.

'We are grateful for the continued support of our family and friends and the good wishes we have received from the public.'

An interim report into the May 4 accident today revealed the engine could have been switched off sooner if a kill cord had been used.

It is supposed to be attached to the skipper's leg so it yanks out the ignition key and cuts the throttle if the helmsman is thrown from the craft.

The
 safety body have not said who was driving the boat but confirmed the 
vessel's kill cord was not attached to whoever was at the helm.

The
 Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said at this stage it was 
'not clear' how the family came to be thrown off their rigid hulled 
inflatable boat (RHIB).

A report said: 'The unmanned RHIB 
subsequently executed a series of tight high speed turns, running over 
members of the family in the water, causing two fatalities and serious 
injuries to two people.

'At this early stage in the 
investigation, the mechanism that led to the family being ejected from 
the RHIB into the water, is not clear.

'The RHIB was fitted with a kill cord but this was not attached to the driver at the time of the accident.

'Consequently,
 when the driver was ejected from the boat, the kill cord did not 
operate to stop the engine and the RHIB continued to circle out of 
control, and at speed.

'As 
the RHIB circled, it ran over the family in the water a number of times,
 leading to the deaths and injuries. A few minutes later a local boatman
 was able to board the RHIB and bring it under control before further 
people were hurt.'

The family, from Wandsworth, south west London, were on holiday in the coastal town when they were thrown from the boat

The MAIB's interim findings were published in the form of a safety bulletin, issued by Steve Clinch, Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents.

The document urged speedboat users to use kill cords at all times and to test them regularly to see if they work.

A full report into the accident is yet to be published.

The bulletin said: 'The kill cord serves only one purpose, to stop the engine when the driver moves away from the controls.

'To
 ensure that this tragic accident is not repeated it is essential that 
all owners and operators of vessels are fitted with kill cords.

'Test
 them regularly to ensure that the engine stops when the kill cord 
mechanism is operated. Make sure that the cord is in good condition.

'Always
 attach the cord securely to the driver, ideally before the engine is 
started, but certainly before the boat is put in gear.

'Stop the engine before transferring the kill cord to another driver.'

Investigators said at this stage it was 'not clear' how the family came to be thrown off their rigid hulled inflatable boat

The family of six were flung into the water as their 300-horsepower Cobra boat spun out of control in the Camel Estuary half a mile from land.

Holidaymakers watched in horror as the empty craft raced round in circles, its propellers slashing the helpless victims and turning the water 'red with blood'.

Mrs Milligan is thought to have had one of her legs amputated below the knee but doctors were able to save Kit's badly mangled leg.

The family, from Wandsworth, south-west London, own a 'dream home' in Trebetherick, which is on the other side of the estuary from Padstow.Â
