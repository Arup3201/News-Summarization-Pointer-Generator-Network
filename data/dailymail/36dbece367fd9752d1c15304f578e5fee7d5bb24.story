A teenage girl died of a suspected asthma attack moments after phoning her mother to say she was suffering from a shortness of breath.

Bianca Hart, 18, was enjoying a night out with friends in Hereford last Thursday when she started having difficulty breathing.

She called her mother to say 'I can't breathe' and then rushed to the nearby County Hospital for treatment.

But she was found unconscious inside the hospital before she could be seen by doctors.

Paramedics battled to save her but she died a few hours later.

Much loved: Tributes to Miss Hart have flooded in on Facebook and Twitter

The beauty student and part-time barmaid, from Tupley in Hereford,  had been celebrating the end of her exams at the Hereford College of Beauty.

Although she managed to make it to County Hospital, she collapsed before treatment could be provided.

Her older sister, university student 
Charlotte, 20, today paid tribute to Miss Hart.

She said: 'Bianca lived life to the full, loved to be around 
her friends and socialising around the town.

'She was a very caring person, trustworthy, lively, beautiful, angelic by nature, fashionable and a confident person.'

Her parents, Micky, 45, and Andrew, 46, are being comforted by friends and family.

They are planning to fund an annual trophy in her name for best student on the course she was studying at Hereford College of Beauty.

A neighbour said: 'It is a terrible 
tragedy - they are a lovely family and she was such a nice young girl 
with everything to live for.

'We had no idea she had asthma. She was always lively and full of life.

'She was ringing her mother and trying to get help when she just died. It is just so sad.'

Tributes to Miss Hart have flooded in on Facebook and 
Twitter.

Faye Summers, her best friend, said: 'I have just lost the biggest part of me.

'I
can’t make myself believe that my beautiful girl has gone. Keep 
expecting her to walk through the door and shout only joking.'

Friend
Liam Wilkinson said: 'It’s mad how someone can die so young with their 
whole life in front of them. Lovely girl - was only speaking couple of
weeks ago. It’s devastating.'

One hundred balloons will be released in Miss Hart's memory tomorrow at her funeral at St Peter’s Church in Hereford.

A post-mortem examination has been held to confirm the cause of death.
