Dozens of pupils were given detentions for watching the solar eclipse – at a school that had boasted it would be celebrating the ‘rare and spectacular’ phenomenon.

But only younger children at the Merseyside secondary were allowed to watch the once-in-a-generation event, with the rest of the school ordered to remain indoors.

Hilbre High School, Wirral, had announced an eclipse-based science project with its younger pupils, who had spent the previous week making safety goggles so they could watch it, saying: ‘Key Stage 3 will be focused on the rare and spectacular event.

'It is great to see students engaging in real-life events.’

But the ban on older children watching the eclipse sparked a revolt, with an entire class skipping lessons so they would not miss out. 

Almost 30 Year 10 pupils streamed out into the streets to watch the moon pass in front of the sun, only to be given immediate detentions.

Last night, parents complained their children had been punished just for showing curiosity about the world around them. 

Clifford Stott, whose daughter was one of those given a detention, said: ‘It was the perfect platform for engaging the children with a whole range of educational issues – physics, mathematics and cosmology. 

'To punish them does little more than alienate them. I feel outraged.’

The school insisted it had punished the children for disobeying warnings during assembly at the start of the day about the dangers of looking at the eclipse with the naked eye.

Principal Jan Levenson said: ‘It was a question of safety. At the heart of this has been the protection of children from the harmful effects of viewing the eclipse without proper eye protection.’ 

During detention, she added, pupils were asked to ‘reflect on their misbehaviour, their truanting and the fact they put themselves at very serious risk’.

The solar eclipse on Friday morning was the first this century and there won't be another one for 19 years
