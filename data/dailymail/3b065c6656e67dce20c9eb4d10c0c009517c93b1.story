Sean Dyche revealed he uses the popular view that Burnley are ‘doomed’ to relegation as a way to inspire his players.

The Clarets’ first goals for 47 days, including a 96th minute Ross Wallace strike, rescued a draw and had Dyche praising the spirit of his side.

‘Virtually everyone outside our club thinks we’re doomed about one minute after we got promoted last season,’ said Dyche, ‘I’m happy to say we don’t think that.

‘We haven’t spent a lot of money and we’ve got a group where many haven’t played regularly in the Premier League. But we’ve also got a group who are very honest, who want to learn, want to improve and want the challenge.’

Burnley have mostly relied on solid defensive performances to get results. On Saturday they broke the club record for most minutes played without a goal before Michael Kightly ended the drought with a 39th-minute equaliser. But Dyche said he had not put pressure on his strikers.

‘Goals have been tricky to come by for sure,’ he said, ‘I think that (first goal) can release some pressure and we went out and got a second and you just feel a bit more relaxed about it.

Ings, who scored 26 goals in the Championship last season, picked up a hamstring injury in September

‘Brian Clough once said to Teddy Sheringham scoring goals it’s the hardest thing in the world. Then he reminded him he did it 251 times in 274 games, so a typical Clough moment.

‘I know that and I don’t put any pressure on our strikers. They do what they do and I was a defender and I think it’s really hard to score goals. They’ve got the freedom to go out and score goals and I believe it will come.’

Dyche is looking forward to the international break and the return from injury of Danny Ings, who scored 26 goals in last season’s Championship campaign but said it was too soon to say his side had turned a corner.

‘One result doesn’t define the next one,’ he said, ‘But what I know is it’s more like how I want the team to perform.’
