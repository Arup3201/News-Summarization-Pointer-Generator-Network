A player was assaulted by hooligans and stripped of his shirt and shorts during a match in an Argentina.

Elias Di Biasi, a midfielder for Deportivo Italiano - playing in Argentina’s fourth division - was stripped of his playing kit and left standing in his underwear.

'At the beginning I was going to try to fend them off, but there were three of them.' said Di Biasi.

The incident took place on Wednesday in the 60th minute of a match against Villa San Carlos, with Deportivo losing 3-0.

Several hooligans wearing hoods raced across the pitch, taunting the victim, before climbing back into the seating area.

Di Biasi was given a replacement kit and the match continued after a short delay.

This is believed to be the first incident of its type in Argentina, though players have previously been stripped of their uniforms after the final whistle by angry hooligans invading the field.

Police did not report any arrests, and a few hundred fans watching seemed entertained by the incident, not angered.
