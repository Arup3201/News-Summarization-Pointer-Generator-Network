A man who was sentenced to die yesterday, is now under investigation for five more capital crimes in a different state. 

A Pennsylvania jury deliberated for seven hours on Tuesday, before coming to the decision to send 40-year-old Charles Ray Hicks to death row for the January 2008 murder of Scranton woman Deanna Null, 36.

Prosecutors said Hicks beheaded Null alive, before chopping up the rest of her body and dumping the remains in black bags scattered along  interstate roads. The remains were recovered by investigators, who also found Null's severed hands hidden in the walls of Hicks' Tobyhanna home.

On Monday, the day before he was sentenced, Hicks allegedly confessed to murdering five more women in Texas before he moved to Pennsylvania, prosecutor Michael Mancuso said. Hicks is originally from Fort Worth.

Going to death row: Charles Hicks, 40, is seen leaving court on Tuesday after receiving the death penalty for the January 2008 murder of 36-year-old Deanna Null 

'As I understand it, yesterday he made certain admissions that he killed some women down there,' Mancuso said. 'And that's going to also be investigated and may result in charges.'

Both Pennsylvania and Texas have the death penalty, but Texas follows through on executing their death row inmate at a higher rate than any other state.

This year alone, 10 people have been executed by lethal injection in Texas compared to just three people in the past two decades in Pennsylvania, despite the state having one of the largest death row populations.

It's still unclear how these new admissions will impact Hicks' death sentence in Pennsylvania, or which state would handle the execution if Hicks is convicted of capital crimes in Texas.

MailOnline's calls to Mancuso were not immediately returned Wednesday morning.  

Hicks himself showed relatively little emotion as he received the life-ending news on Tuesday, but reporters in court said his eyes filled with tears. 

His sisters attended the hearing and started sobbing when they heard the decision. Hicks' sister and mother defended him in court on Monday, pleading the jury to use mercy in deciding the sentence.

However, the 12-person jury, which included eight females and four males, eventually decided on the death sentence after determining that Hicks tortured Null before she died.

In Pennsylvania, all capital crimes must include proof of an aggravated circumstance, such as torture. In the middle of their deliberations, a jury member was sent back into court to get the legal definition of torture from the judge. 

The decision did not appear to be an easy one for the jury, as two members were seen wiping away tears as the sentence was read.

Hicks' family weren't the only ones to defend his character in court on Monday either, a former cell mate and prison guard testified that he should be spared the death penalty. 

Jerel Johnson shared a cell with Hicks when he was on trial for murder charge he has since been acquitted of. Thought he was in a 'very dark place' at the time, Hicks helped him get through it.  

A former prison guard who now volunteers to teach bible study classes as a Jehovah's Witness says several inmates in his group look to Hicks for wisdom.

However, those views were countered by a former fiancée who said Hicks became a different person when he started abusing drugs and that he once threatened to kill her.  

Hicks' case is far from over since all death penalties are automatically reviewed by the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, which can cancel a death sentence.  

Hicks will formally be sentenced on January 6.
