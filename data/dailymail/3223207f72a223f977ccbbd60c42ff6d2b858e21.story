Bronwyn and Jim Monro adopted Nishantha from Sir Lanka into their family when he was 16 months old 

When Bronwyn and Jim Monro were told  that their adopted son was schizophrenic 20 years ago, they had no idea what the illness was or what it would come to mean for their family.

Their son’s diagnosis, when he was 18-years-old, came after a ‘screaming episode’ in the park near their home in the sought-after suburb of Balmain, in Sydney’s inner west.

‘He was screaming and running around the park. We called the ambulance and police… there are steep cliffs in the park and we were scared he was going to jump off,’ Mrs Monro told Daily Mail Australia.

‘That’s really scary when you don’t understand that they are mentally ill, you don’t know what to do.’

The couple, who are both retired teachers, adopted Nishantha into their family at the age of 16 months, in 1976. He was abandoned at birth and found on the doorsteps of a children’s hospital in Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka.

They will never know if his mental illness is genetic because the hospital had no records of who his biological parents are.

‘I used to wonder if the rejection from his parents caused his illness,’ Mrs Monro recalled.

She said Nishantha was ‘tricky’ from a young age. He would skip classes at school and teachers would describe him as ‘very bright but quiet difficult to manage.’

Mrs Monro, 66, and Mr Monro, 69, already had two biological daughters, now aged 43 and 40, when they adopted him. Three years later they also adopted Chaminda, who became Nisantha’s brother.

The couple first took Nishantha to a councillor when he was only little.

‘We knew it was quite difficult to come from overseas and fit in and Balmain is a very yuppy area, there weren’t very many black kids around back then,’ Mrs Monro explained.

Nishantha Monro, pictured here at the age of 18, was diagnosed with schizophrenia 20 years ago 

Although Nishantha has never spoken about being bullied growing up in Sydney, his mother conceded that he may have had a hard time.

At the age of 15 he took an overdose.

‘I was highly alarmed but I had no idea it was about mental health, it just wasn’t spoken about at the time,’ Mrs Monro said.

‘When he took his overdose we still didn’t know he was going to develop schizophrenia. I didn’t even know what it was when he got the diagnosis at 18,’ she added.

The Monros had no history of mental health illness in their family and even the doctors at the time of Nishantha’s overdose did not suspect he was schizophrenic.

The terrifying incident happened in 1994 and Mr and Mrs Monro were told their son simply had a personality disorder. A psychiatrist said ‘he’s very spontaneous, he doesn’t think’.

At 17, Nishantha had started drinking. He was sneaking out at night and taking drugs and when he was 18, after the screaming incident in the park, he punched a hole in the wall and left home.

‘We didn’t understand so we were in this mode of disapproval. He didn’t talk about his feeling but we never invited a discussion because we thought if we used strong parenting we could “sort it out”,’ Mrs Monro said.

When Nishantha left home he began drinking a lot. ‘After his landlord chucked him out of one flat, he moved to another place opposite a bottle shop,’ she added.

His mother agrees that his drug and alcohol use may be a way to block out his schizophrenia. And last November he stopped taking his prescribed medication, claiming it made him sleepy.

‘He’s still so impulsive and we wonder whether the medication affects his enjoyment of the drugs , the medications are supposed to dull you down a bit and we wonder if they do that inhibit his ability to feel pleasure in life,’ Mrs Monro explained.

Bronwyn and Jim Monro want to speak openly about their son and reduce the stigma around schizophrenia  

By the age of 21 Nishantha, seen here with his adopted brother Chaminda, had left home and was battling with an alcohol addiction 

Nishantha lives in a housing commission building in Redfern. His mother has concerns about him living there because there are ‘drugs and alcohol everywhere’.

He’s provided with a disability pension, while Mrs Monro - who worked as a teacher for 42 years - now acts as his carer.

‘He wants to live with us but that would give him more money for drugs and alcohol. When you are not in this drug world it’s very hard to understand. I do try to be positive.’

Over the years Mrs Monro and her husband Jim have gone from knowing nothing about schizophrenia and mental health to educating themselves so that they can not only understand and help their son but also share their experience with other families.

They run the Balmain schizophrenia carers group once a month and Mrs Monro also runs a carers group for older ladies in Belmore

‘We’ve done a lot of courses so we’ve got more educated and informed about drug matters.

'You have no idea what a nice person my son is': Mrs Monro described her son as 'quirky' but said she has never once been scared of him. He is seen here in 2009 at 32 (left) and at 27 in 2002 (right)

Mrs Monro said the happiest times she shares with her son are when he opens up to her about his feelings

‘A burden shared is a burden halved. Just listening to others and being able to share my story means a lot to me… Jim and I believe we need to be open about mental health so people don’t get caught like we were,’ she said.

Mrs Monro wants to reduce the stigma around schizophrenia and wants the world to know that the illness does not make someone dangerous. She said she has never been concerned for her own safety around her son.

‘You have no idea what a nice person my son is; he has a quirky personality and is so engaging when he’s functioning well.’

Nishantha is now using meth amphetamine, commonly known as ice, which Mrs Monro said makes him ‘cranky and irritable’ and means he does ‘a lot of screaming’.

‘He tells us he’s been screaming on the bus and in his flat. But my son is not violent.’

For Mrs Monro, the happiest times she shares with her son are when he opens up to her about his feelings.

‘He doesn’t very often say it but sometime he says “I know you love and care for me” and he says “I don’t have any friends now, you and dad are the only people”.

Bronwyn (pictured) said she has spent years learning about schizophrenia so she can empathise with her son

‘The other good moments are when you feel like you can understand him and can stand in his shoes for a few minutes. The only way I could get an insight into his perspective is to do all this training.

Jack Heath, CEO of national mental health charity SANE Australia said carers are under pressure

‘When you grow up in a moralistic upright church way like we did sometimes it’s hard to understand.’

Bronwyn and Jim want to open the discussion around mental health and not turn people off the subject and are supporting charity SANE with a new drive for carers.

Over the last decade in Australia, the delivery of mental health services has shifted from institutions to the community, which often means that families carry more and more of the burden of supportive care.

More than 230,000 Australians have schizophrenia and it can have a profound effect on those close to them as family members may have feelings of guilt and shame and may have to cope with loved ones who have difficult and demanding behaviour.

A new health coaching service for carers of those living with schizophrenia will also soon be launching called CareCompass and a new resource has been launched to help share information called Full Story Schizophrenia.

Jack Heath, CEO of national mental health charity SANE Australia told Daily Mail Australia: ‘When a family is first struck by an incident of severe mental illness, they don’t know what to do and where to turn to. But if they feel part of community it helps.'

Mr Heath explained how carers also need a break. 'I've spoken to so many carers over the years and it's challenging for them... they tend to through everything  and not remember to look after themselves and they get quite high rates of depression themselves,' he said.
