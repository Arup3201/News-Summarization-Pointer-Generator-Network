Cristiano Ronaldo capped off a memorable year by winning the best player of 2014 accolade at the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai on Monday.

The 29-year-old, who is hotly tipped to follow up this success by claiming his third FIFA Ballon d'Or early next month - and second in successive years - received the award at the Atlantis luxury hotel as part of the Globe Soccer Conference.

Ronaldo was joined by his Real Madrid team-mate James Rodriguez and manager Carlo Ancelotti at the awards ceremony.

Already this year Ronaldo has broken the record for the number of goals scored in a single Champions League season as he played an integral role in Madrid securing their 10th La Liga title, while reaching 200 league goals in just 178 games - faster than any other player in La Liga history.

As well as this the Portugal forward maintained his better than a goal-per-game ratio across five prolific years in Spain - thus arguably enjoying his finest year yet of his professional career.

Elsewhere, the Madrid forward has been making the most of the winter break in Spain, as he posted a picture on Twitter earlier this week soaking up the sun from a yacht in Dubai.

The reigning European champions are set to take  on AC Milan on Tuesday in what is expected to be an unforgettable evening of football, with the Sevens Stadium widely expected to be sold out . This game is in partnership with the Dubai Football Challenge.

But his and his team-mates attention will quickly turn back to La Liga come the turn of the year though, as they look to extend their one-point lead at the top of the table over arch-rivals Barcelona - who have currently played a game more.
