A woman in McArthur, Ohio came home from a two-week vacation last month to discover her house had been mistakenly repossessed.

At first Katie Barnett, 36, thought the changed locks meant a squatter, but reality turned out to be much worse than that when she broke into her own home and found it completely emptied.

It turns out the repo men sent by First National Bank of Wellston, Ohio to gut the house, had mistaken Barnett's house for the bank-owned home across the street.

Unpleasant surprise: When Katie Barnett returned from vacation last month, she found her house had been mistakenly repossessed

'A GPS had led them to my house, the president of the bank told me,' Barnett told 10 TV. 'They also said my grass hadn't been mowed so they just assumed that was the house.'

Ms Barnett points out that the houses are clearly marked. The bank owned 509, and her house is 514.

The wrong house: The GPS system used by the repo men took them to Barnett's house, number 514, instead of bank-owned number 509. They assumed that the overgrown grass meant it was the correct property

Now Ms Barnett, a nurse with children ages six to 18, wants her life back, but the bank isn't being accommodating in the way she hoped.

Ms Barnett sent the bank an estimate of the lost items, totaling $18,000 and the president refused to pay it.Â 

Among the items lost in the foreclosure were car engine parts valued at $9,000.

'He told me that I would probably need receipts for everything that they took and they were not paying retail. I told him I wasn't running a yard sale and asking them to make me an offer,' Ms Barnett told Good Morning America.

Proof of purchase: Ms Barnett says the bank has asked her to provide receipts for everything she lost

'I told him I don't keep receipts around for everything I have just in a case a bank comes by and steals my stuff. And if I did, where do you think it would be? With the stuff that you threw away?'

Bank President and CEO Tony Thorne issued a statement with their side of the store.

Mr Thorne apologized for the incident, saying: 'Nothing like this has ever happened before.'

As for Ms Barnett's list of losses, he insists that the written list of items she provided were 'inconsistent with the list and descriptions of items removed that was prepared by the employees who did the work.'

Inconsistent: First National Bank's President and CEO Tony Thorne said Ms Barnett's list of items is different from the list his repo men prepared while emptying the house

Barnett has retained an attorney and plans to sue the bank.

'We are definitely going to bring a lawsuit,' she said. 'I gave them a chance and they are not willing to work with me.'

Outrage over the faulty repression has spread to the internet. One petition has over 13,000 signers demanding First National Bank pay Ms Barnett her money immediately 'so she can get her life back again.'

For the time being, Barnett and her children are living with just the furniture that the bank left behind.

'It's kind of ruined their summer, that's for sure,' she said.
