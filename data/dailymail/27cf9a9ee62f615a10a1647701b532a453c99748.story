Radamel Falcao will hope he is one of the noisy neighbours this season.

The reason for this is that the Manchester United striker’s pet parrot squawks each time his owner scores!

The 28-year-old, who moved to Old Trafford on deadline day, opened his account for the Red Devils by netting the winner in the weekend win against Everton.

Radamel Falcao scored his first Manchester United goal in the win against Everton at the weekend 

Each time he scores, Falcao's parrot squawks 'goal from Falca' 

That – reports The Sun – sets off the family’s parrot.

Falcao’s wife Lorelei, 26, said: ‘My parrot says, “goal from Falca, “great goal” and more’.

The Colombian surprisingly took four games to get off the mark for United, who have struggled under Louis van Gaal at various junctures this season.

However, his parrot will barely have stopped squawking during his spells with Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco. 

Falcao is currently away with Colombia, who face Canada next week.
