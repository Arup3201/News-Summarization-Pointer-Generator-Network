A young boy who stars in the film Nativity 3 defied the odds to become an actor and dancer after doctors warned he may never walk or talk again after brain surgery.

Ben underwent a nine-hour operation because the plates in his skull had not fused correctly after birth.

The youngster, from Cannock, Staffordshire, was diagnosed with craniosynostosis when he was two years old.

Doctors warned his parents he may not survive the procedure to relieve pressure on his brain.

But a decade later and Ben, now 12 years old, has starred in all three Nativity films, alongside co-stars Martin Clunes, Catherine Tate and Ralf Little.

Last weekend he joined them at the premiere of Nativity 3, in London's Leicester Square.

Ben, who plays 'Bob' in the films, underwent the complex operation at Birmingham Children's Hospital when he was two years old.

Craniotosis, which occurs in one in 2,000 children, is a condition where one or more of the plates in an infant's skull fuses too soon after birth.

It can cause pressure in the brain, which can lead to blindness, sleeping and eating problems, as well as problems with mental development.

His terrified family were told he may not survive, but Ben, who attends the prestigious Sylvia Young Theatre School in London, recovered.

He has since gone on to launch an acting career and win dance titles including European freestyle champion.

He beat 500 other hopefuls to the role of Bob in the first Nativity film - turning up for the auditions wearing fake tan, fluorescent green hot pants, matching leg warmers and a T-shirt emblazoned with the words Born To Dance.

Ben's mother, Jill Wilby, said: 'He just loves these premieres.

'He loves having his picture taken and mixing with stars on the red carpet.

'The film has lots of laughs, as usual, but it is a real tear jerker. I advise people to take their handkerchiefs when they see it.'

Celebrities who attended the premiere included EastEnders actor and Strictly Come Dancing hopeful Jake Wood and X Factor reject Jake Quickenden.

Ms Wilby added: 'It has been an incredible ten years since Ben's operation.

'Doctors warned us that if Ben survived the operation he might never walk or even talk.

'Since then he has become a European dancing champion and has starred in three major films. He is my miracle boy. Dancing and acting is all he has ever wanted to do.

'We have never really pushed him - he was the one doing the pushing.

'He lives to perform and put a smile on people's faces.'

Nativity 3: Dude, Where's My Donkey will be screened in cinemas from November 14.
