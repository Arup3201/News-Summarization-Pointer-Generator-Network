Former Chelsea and Real Madrid midfielder Michael Essien has been forced to deny rumours that he has Ebola.

The Ghanaian star, now playing his club football with AC Milan, was left out of his country's squad for a 1-1 draw in the African Cup of Nations qualifier in Guinea.

But rumours on Twitter sprung up that Essien had contracted the virus, something the player was quick to deny, insisting he is ready to play for Milan.

Essien posted to his Instagram account to dispell the rumours he had contracted the Ebola virus

Essien was angry with the rumours and sent his sympathy to 'the true victims of Ebola'

'I'm very fit and very healthy,' he posted on Instagram. 'No truth in the internet rumours that I have contracted Ebola.'

'I'm well & will be training as usual tomorrow.The Ebola virus is a very serious issue and people shouldn't joke about it.

'Whoever wrote this article is very unprofessional and insensitive...!!!#Jahbless.'

He then continued on Twitter: 'The true victims of Ebola deserve better and our thoughts & prayers are with them and their families.#sue'

Essien insists he will be back to train with AC Milan tomorrow, as both he and the club denied the rumour

The player's club were also quick to quash the rumours, and the suggestion that an AC Milan spokesman had confirmed them earlier in the evening. 

A club statement read: 'AC Milan categorically denies alleged news from abroad about its members. 

'Such news, totally unfounded, however, have never been confirmed by any employee of our company.'
