One of the country's leading organic gardeners has outraged green groups by championing the use of peat.

Bob Flowerdew, 58, has admitted that he relies on peat-based compost to grow plants.

But his comments have outraged conservationists, who complained that they would encourage the destruction of wildlife-rich peat bogs by amateur gardeners following suit.

They say Mr Flowerdew, a regular panellist on Radio 4’s Gardeners’ Question Time, is setting a poor example to the nation’s gardeners.

Peatlands take centuries to form and ‘lock up’ carbon that otherwise contributes to global warning.

In his column in Amateur Gardening magazine, Mr Flowerdew wrote: 'Right here I go into the fire both feet first.

'I demand the right to use a modicum of peat in my garden.'

Mr Flowerdew, author of several organic gardening guides, admitted he uses small amounts of peat-based compost on some of his seeds.

He went on: 'So far, in all my trials, I have found no other compost to be anywhere near as reliable for turning seeds into healthy, robust seedlings.

'Would all those protesters wishing to reduce peat usage please remember that no matter how slow it can in fact regenerate - allegedly only an inch or so a century - with the thousands of acres available, this does gradually become a renewable resource, just like a forest.

'And he called for a licensing system for peat 'sourced from managed and sustainable sites.'

Friends of the Earth spokesman Helen Rimmer said: 'We are disappointed that Flowerdew has used his magazine column to promote peat when, as an organic grower, he should promote peat alternatives.

'We face an urgent climate change crisis. Peat bogs are vital carbon sinks and home to thousands of insects and birds.

'There is little lowland bog left, so it’s vital we protect what remains.

'Peat alternatives are now just as good. There’s no valid argument for using peat in the garden.'

Myles Bremner, chief executive of charity Garden Organic, said: 'We don’t believe there’s any need or justification for using peat.

'Minimising peat use to virtually nothing is what we want more people to do.

'If every gardener took Flowerdew’s approach, then the UK would be using more than mere handfuls of peat, which isn’t sustainable.'

Earlier this year, gardening guru Alan Titchmarsh, 62, also sparked a storm by admitting that he uses small amounts of peat-based compost.

But the pair were defended by Amateur Gardening editor Tim Rumball, who said: 'Any common sense debate about peat has become swamped by hysterical invective from environmentalists and opportunistic politicians who deliberately fail to look at the bigger picture.

'Everyday activities like driving a car, switching on a light or cooking are much more damaging than using small amounts of peat to grow plants.

'No gardener wants to harm the planet. Growing plants is an environmentally beneficial pastime.'
