A television executive and his young daughter might have been saved if their speedboat’s ‘kill cord’ safety device had been properly used, it was claimed last night.

Nick Milligan, 51, a doting father and senior Sky TV boss, and eight-year- old daughter Emily died when they were run over by the out-of-control powerboat.

His yoga-teacher wife Victoria, 41, and their four-year-old son Kit both face losing their legs from ‘life-changing’ wounds caused by the £60,000 craft’s propeller.

Nick Milligan and his eight-year-old daughter Emily (far left) were killed and the rest of the family - wife Victoria and children Amber, Olivia and Kit - are in hospital after being injured when they were thrown from their boat which then ran over them with its propeller

Their two other children, Amber, 12, and Olivia, ten, suffered less serious injuries in the Bank Holiday weekend horror in Padstow, Cornwall – where the London family owns a ‘dream’ holiday house.

Mr Milligan’s brother Max paid emotional tribute to ‘an extremely loving father and husband, son and brother, who doted on his family’.

Police said the death toll would have been ‘far worse’ but for heroic watersports instructor Charlie Toogood, who risked his life to leap into the runaway powerboat from another boat, and stop its engine.

'Coastguards praised his ‘incredible seamanship and bravery’.

The family of six were flung into the water as their 300-horsepower Cobra boat spun out of control in the Camel Estuary half a mile from land at 3.50pm on Sunday.

Hundreds of holidaymakers watched in horror as the empty craft raced round in circles, its propellers slashing the helpless victims and turning the water ‘red with blood’.

Padstow harbourmaster Rob Atkinson suggested the disaster could have been averted if the boat’s ‘kill cord’ – a device which shuts down the engine if the skipper goes overboard – had been used.

Photographs of the speedboat being taken away by Coastguards showed the kill cord still in place, apparently unused.

It
is supposed to be attached to the skipper’s leg and operates 
as a ‘dead man’s handle’, effectively yanking out the ignition key and 
cutting the throttle if the helmsman is thrown from the craft.

Mr
Atkinson said: ‘Please, please, please, when you have a boat fitted 
with a kill cord, make sure the kill cord is operating correctly and 
make sure it is attached to you because if you go out of the boat, it 
will stop the engine and it will prevent tragedies like this happening.’

Police said the kill cord – and whether or not it had been used – was a ‘key focus’ of their investigation.

TV executive Mr Milligan – a co-founder of Channel 5 who went on to become the managing director of Sky Media – built a dream beach house a few years ago in Trebetherick, which is on the other side  of the estuary from Padstow, said his brother.

Mr Milligan described it in 2011 as his ‘most treasured possession’.

Witness Simon Lewins, from Wadebridge, said: ‘We saw a boat coming up the estuary and it seemed to take a right turn. As it took the turn it flopped and the people in the boat went out in the water and then the boat went round in circles and it seemed to come back into the group on three or four occasions.

‘We heard screaming and saw seagulls coming into the water, it wasn’t good.

‘As this happens the boat was taking ever-decreasing circles with nobody in it because they were all in the water and it was slowing and it kept going for ten, 15 minutes.’

Padstow resident Martin Jenkins, 63, added: ‘It looked terrible. The water was filled with blood like a horror film.’

Three RNLI lifeboats were sent to the scene as well as search and rescue helicopters. The four survivors of the accident were flown to Derriford hospital in Plymouth.

Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell, of Devon and Cornwall Police, thanked members of the public including a kayaker who had tried to protect the stricken  family from the circling powerboat, adding: ‘Everyone’s assistance undoubtedly saved lives.’

He said six life jackets had been recovered from the scene of the tragedy. He would not say whether they had been worn or not.

He said the mother and son had received ‘serious leg injuries which may result in life-changing implications’.

The two older daughters were said to be ‘recovering well’.

About 25 police officers have been assigned to the investigation into the accident, and are preparing reports for the local coroner.

Speedboats are common sights around the harbour area in the popular tourist destination, nicknamed ‘Padstein’ because it is the home of celebrity chef Rick Stein.

He tweeted: ‘Our thoughts are with the injured and bereaved involved in the tragic accident.’
