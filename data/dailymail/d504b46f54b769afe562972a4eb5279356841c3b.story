Now that's quite a haul.

Police from the Middle Eastern Crime Squad seized a gold 'pen gun', five rounds of ammunition, four grams of crystal methamphetamine, two knives, four mobile phones and cash when they stopped a Toyota Corolla in Padstow in Sydney's south-western suburbs on Friday afternoon.

The 41-year-old driver, who police allege was driving on a suspended license, was taken to Bankstown Police Station where he was charged with weapons and drugs offences.

He appeared in Parramatta Local Court on Saturday where he was refused bail.

The man is expected to reappear in Bankstown Local Court on Monday afternoon.
