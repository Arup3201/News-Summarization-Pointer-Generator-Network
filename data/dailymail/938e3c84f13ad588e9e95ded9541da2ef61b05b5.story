She might be an Olympic silver medallist with high hopes for Rio 2016, but even Zara Phillips struggles to mount her horse sometimes.

The Queen's granddaughter ran into difficulties as she attempted to pull herself into the saddle of a horse lent to her during the Magic Millions Barrier Draw event on Queensland's Gold Coast.

Ever the professional, the 33-year-old not only managed to mount up but went on to put on a stellar show for the excited crowd that had gathered round to watch.

Up she goes: Zara Phillips seemingly struggled to pull herself onto her horse as she prepared to participate in the opening of the Magic Millions On the Gold Coast, Australia, on Tuesday

Dressed in a pale blue shirt and grey leggings, the royal was taking part in a gallop down the beach during the prestigious Magic Millions race meeting which began on Monday.   

Zara, who has long been famous for her love of all things equestrian, is an ambassador for the meet and attends most year.

Along with racing, the event also hosts one of the country’s most popular thoroughbred horse sales, although unlike her husband, who owns a racehorse of his own, she didn't appear tempted to buy.

Zara will also present the winner of the Racing Women prize, which aims to encourage more women into the sport, with a sizeable cheque and trophy.

According to sources, Zara herself was offered a ‘small fortune’ to become an ambassador for the event, while her trip has been bankrolled by Magic Millions co-founder Gerry Harvey.

Fulfilling her ambassador duties, Zara was seen chatting to local reporters and wearing a pair of headphones as she commentated on the day's proceedings.

But it hasn't all been plain sailing for the royal, who is now alone in Australia after waving husband Mike Tindall off at Sydney Airport on Friday ahead of a flight home.

The couple, who had been staying in the harbourside town of Vaucluse, were seen enjoying a passionate kiss as they said their goodbyes.

Joining Tindall on the plane was daughter Mia, who celebrates her first birthday on the 17th January.

Although Zara has an engagement in Australia on Friday, she is expected to fly home at the weekend and will be with her daughter in Gloucestershire to celebrate.
