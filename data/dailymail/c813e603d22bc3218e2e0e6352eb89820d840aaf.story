A teenager was banned from the classroom by his school because he had a haircut inspired by his footballing heroes.

Thirteen-year-old Lewis Kenny copied Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero and Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale with his hairstyle, but teachers considered it too 'extreme'. 

The year nine pupil, who is mad about football and rugby league, was taken out of classes and put in 'isolation' for a day  by St Ambrose Barlow High School in Wardley, Salford.

Lewis's parents – Liam, 49, and Angela, 50, from Worsley, Greater Manchester, had an emergency meeting with staff and have since made a formal complaint.

Style clash: Thirteen-year-old Lewis Kenny copied Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero's hair - but teachers said it was too 'extreme' and put him in isolation

Mr Kenny said: 'What I want is an acknowledgement that they are wrong. They have said that he has an extreme haircut and he must restyle his hair to how the school wants it.

'The haircut is similar to Sergio Aguero and Gareth Bale and it's a modern haircut for a boy his age to have.' 

Last month his best friend, Jack Littlewood, also 13, was given the same punishment because his haircut – worn short said his family to stop his thick hair from becoming unruly – was considered in breach of school rules which state boys should wear their hair no shorter than a number three cut.

Both boys arrived at St Ambrose Barlow in September following the closure of St George's High School in Walkden. Their parents say they have never been in trouble for their hairstyles before.

Mr Kenny added: 'Lewis's hair is a number three cut and longer on top.

'It is a better look than long greasy hair. The school said they had spotted a line in his hair like the one worn by Aguero. But he only has a line put in the school holidays.

'He was upset to be placed in isolation and we are standing firm on this. It is disgraceful.

'We think it is victimisation.' Headteacher Marie Garside said: 'Both parents and pupils are made aware of our high expectations and aspirations before they choose the school. We are very clear about what we accept and don't accept and we make it explicit about what we feel are appropriate standards at our parent information evenings.

'Our staff work above and beyond the school day to make sure pupils work as well as they can and reach their potential.'

Policy: Rules at the Salford school demands that boys should wear their hair no shorter than a number three cut

Heroes: Lewis, like many boys, adopt cuts like superstar Gareth Bale and others, but it is landing some in trouble

Not happy: Lewis' father Liam has had a meeting with the school and also made a formal complaint

School clampdowns on haircuts appear to be on trend, as schools consider several modern styles 'extreme'.

This week two brothers were kicked out of classes at school and made to study in isolation because they have spiky haircuts.

Keiran Matthews, 16, and his 13-year-old brother Callum, returned for lessons at Marches School in Oswestry, Shropshire, last week proudly sporting their new styles.

But teachers branded their haircuts 'extreme' and took them out of their classes and placed them in isolation instead.

They said that the style, which is closely shaved on the sides but spiky on top, broke school rules and their policy on uniform.

Another extreme cut? Keiran Matthews and his brother Callum, who were both taken out of classes at school because they have spiky hair 

The teens' father Tony, 44, told of his anger at the ban on the style, which is called the skinfade, as he says most children are sporting it these days.

He explained: 'I understood the school has its policies that include hairstyles.

'But I’m just angry they seem to have been singled out'.
