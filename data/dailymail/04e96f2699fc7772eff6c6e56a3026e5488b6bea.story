Dressed in period costume, seven-year-old Karl Doran is pictured at the museum where he was crushed to death.

The youngster died after falling from the trailer of a steam-powered traction engine which was being driven by his father at an open-air museum.

He would ride the rear of the machine in period costume as his dad drove around the museum's grounds.

Karl, who lived in Darlington, had been enjoying a ride on the vintage vehicle being driven  by his father Phillip Doran, 41, when the accident happened.

Emergency
services arrived at Beamish museum, near Stanley, County Durham, just 
before 3pm but Karl, who had suffered serious head injuries, died at the
scene.

His father, a museum volunteer, was taken to hospital suffering from shock immediately after the incident but has since been able to speak to police.

DCI Victoria Fuller, who is leading the 
joint police and health and safety investigation, said today: 'We are treating this as a tragic 
incident and are working with our colleagues in the Health and Safety 
Executive to establish the exact circumstances.

'We have already spoken to a number of witnesses but need to speak to 
some key people who may have been on a bus or tram which passed the 
traction engine around the time of the incident which occurred at around
3pm.'

Karl and his father, both steam enthusiasts, were frequent volunteers at
Beamish.

Mr Doran was driving the steam traction engine along a road adjacent to the railway line in the museum grounds when the incident happened.

A post mortem examination carried out last night confirmed that Karl's death was due to a head injury.

Richard Evans, the museum director, said today: 'We continue 
to support the joint investigation and offer our deep condolences to 
Karl’s family.'

The
award-winning museum, which has working trams and other old fashioned 
machines driving around its grounds, was packed with families enjoying 
the good weather and the first weekend of the school holidays.

Tragic: Little Karl Doran died from serious head injuries after falling from the trailer of a steam-powered traction engine

Inspector Stephen Dowdle, of Durham Constabulary, said yesterday: ‘A seven-year-old boy had been involved in an incident with a steam traction engine and trailer and had been pronounced dead at the scene.

‘He appeared to have suffered serious head injuries.

‘The engine driver was taken to 
hospital suffering from shock. He will be spoken to by police at an 
appropriate time and is being treated as a witness.

‘Detectives and road policing officers are at the scene to establish exactly what took place.’

Police were carrying out a joint investigation with the Health and Safety Executive, he added.

The
museum, whose full name is the Living Museum of the North, opened in 
its current form in 1970 and preserves life as it was in 1913.

Its
thousands of objects and original, replica and relocated buildings are 
based on the early 20th century, late Victorian period and the 
Industrial Revolution of 1825.

They include a replica town, village, 
railway station and farm which helps preserve traditional and rare 
livestock breeds, as well as a mid-19th century drift mine.

The
museum has won several awards, including the Sandford Award for 
Heritage Education 2011 and Living Museum of the Year in 2000, 2002 and 
2004.

In 1986 it was named British Museum of 
the Year and the following year was crowned European Museum of the Year.
Its supporters include Art Council England and the Heritage Lottery 
Fund.

Horror: Paramedics were called to the museum (file picture) just before 3pm yesterday. Karl 
was pronounced dead at the scene after suffering head injuries and his father Philip was taken to hospital suffering from shock

Staff in period costume and visitors can get around using a steam railway, tramway, wagonway and old buses.

Last night hundreds of Facebook users paid tribute to the boy on the museum’s page on the social networking website.

Anna Barker wrote: ‘Such awful news for all involved. Thoughts to the little boy and his family and also to the staff at Beamish who are such a close-knit community.’

Lisa Caroline Dixon added: ‘Such a tragic accident. Thoughts of deep condolences go out to his family, friends, all those involved and the evacuated visitors today who must all be deeply devastated.

Stephen Coulthard said he had seen the boy on the engine earlier in the day and described the death as ‘tragic’.

Kenny Flint Snr wrote: ‘Such a sad, sad day. A young lad doing something he must have really enjoyed, being involved and around steam engines. R.I.P little man our thoughts go out to your family and friends.’

Catherine Lundy said: ‘Very sorry to hear about this awful event at such a beautiful place of interest. Thoughts are with the family.’

Any witnesses are urged to contact Durham Police.
