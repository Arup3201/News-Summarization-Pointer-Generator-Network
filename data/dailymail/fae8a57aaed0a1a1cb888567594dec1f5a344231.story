You had to be impressed by Manchester City’s performance at Roma on Wednesday night. 

Their intent was clear from the start and they finally began to look like a team with authority in Europe.

I’ve questioned why they persist with two up front in European games. Although they were forced into the change, with Sergio Aguero injured, they looked much better with Fernando and Fernandinho sitting in midfield and just one up front. It was just what was needed for that game.

Samir Nasri was outstanding. Sometimes he doesn’t dominate games but with Aguero and Yaya Toure not playing and David Silva not starting, he rose to the challenge. Maybe he feels a little bit in the shadow of those players but he played like a leader.

It was a wonderful performance and Manuel Pellegrini must be delighted. Now they’re in the last 16 of the Champions League, they’ll have confidence to grow and progress.

And at least they can’t get Bayern Munich in the next round.
