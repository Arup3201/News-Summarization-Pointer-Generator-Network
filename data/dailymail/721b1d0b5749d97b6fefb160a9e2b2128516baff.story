Nasa had chosen the ambitious mission that will visit a comet and pluck a boulder from its surface to create an orbiting base for astronauts.

A robot ship
will pluck a large boulder off an asteroid and sling it around
the moon, becoming a destination to prepare for future
human missions to Mars, the U.S. space agency has revealed.

The so-called Asteroid Redirect Mission is estimated to cost
about $1.25 billion not including launch costs and is targeted
for liftoff in December 2020. 

It would be followed five years
later by a human expedition to the space rock, a modification of
a plan proposed by President Barack Obama in 2010.

Nasa plans to pick up a boulder from a large asteroid (shown) using a robotic ship

It will then be taken to lunar orbit, where it would be studied by astronauts

Nasa also considered bagging a smaller asteroid and
relocating the entire body into a high orbit around the moon.

After extensive studies, Nasa opted to collect and move a
boulder, a mission that will cost about $100 million more, but
which better prepares the agency for the ultimate goal of
landing astronauts on Mars.

'They're the kind of things that we know we're going to need
when we go to another planetary body,' NASA Associate
Administrator Robert Lightfoot told reporters on a conference
call.

NASA plans to study the asteroid for about a year and test
deflection techniques that one day may be necessary to save
Earth from a potentially catastrophic collision. 

An asteroid or
comet smashed into the planet about 65 million years ago,
leading to climate changes that killed off dinosaurs and most
other life on Earth then.

So far, NASA has three candidate asteroids, but does not
expect to make a decision about where to fly before 2019.

The mission involves flying a robotic spacecraft, powered by
solar electric propulsion, to an asteroid for an extensive
survey.

Once a target boulder was selected, the probe would
hover down toward the surface and deploy a pair of robot arms to
grab hold of a 6.5- to 13-foot (2- to 4 meter) wide boulder.

The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle.

After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object.

Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows.

After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean - likely the Pacific - 10 days later.

The mission is seen as an important step towards eventually sending humans to Mars and returning them safely. 

'I'm going to have multiple targets ... We can assess which
one we want to go after and I then have three- to five tries to
get it, or I can move on to a different one,' Lightfoot said.

The captured boulder, which would remain attached to the
probe, would then be nudged into an orbit circling high around
the moon, a maneuver expected to take about six years.

The probe would include a docking ring so a NASA Orion
spaceship, carrying two astronauts, could reach the asteroid, a
mission targeted for around 2025. 

Nasa's ultimate goal is to send humans to Mars, and they say the Asteroid Redirect Mission (Arm) will be an important stepping stone towards getting there.

A number of new spaceflight capabilities will be tested in the 2020s as part of the mission, which will involve redirecting an asteroid to orbit the moon and sending humans to explore it. 

Astronauts aboard Nasa's Orion spacecraft, launched from the upcoming Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, will then explore the asteroid in the mid-2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon

Nasa plans to launch an Arm robotic spacecraft to rendezvous with, capture and redirect an asteroid by the end of this decade.

The spacecraft will redirect it to a stable orbit around the moon called a 'Distant Retrograde Orbit' - one that orbits the moon very widely, coming quite close before extending out much further away.

Astronauts aboard Nasa's Orion spacecraft, launched from the upcoming Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, will then explore the asteroid in the mid-2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon.

Within the papers, authors explain the current work taking place across the country to examine options for these robotic and crewed missions.

This includes advanced Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) - one of the critical technologies needed to send larger payloads into deep space and to the Mars system.

SEP - or ion propulsion - creates thrust powered by solar arrays, which transforms sunlight into electromagnetic fields that accelerate and expel charged atoms (ions).

This is a very efficient way to power a spacecraft and significantly cuts down on the amount of fuel a spacecraft needs to carry, which can be heavy and expensive to launch from Earth.

The agency plans to announce the specific asteroid selected for the mission no earlier than 2019, approximately a year before launching the robotic spacecraft. 

Before an asteroid is considered a valid candidate for the mission, scientists must first determine its characteristics, in addition to size, such as rotation, shape and precise orbit. 

NASA has identified three valid candidates for the mission so far: Itokawa, Bennu and 2008 EV5.

The agency expects to identify one or two additional candidates each year leading up to the mission. 

Returning asteroid samples will help Nasa develop  tools and techniques for future space exploration.

This early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space.

Rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air, drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel. 

There also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future.

With this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which Arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids - namely collecting resources for use back on Earth or in space.

Current studies at Nasa detailed in the papers are examining ways SEP will be used to power the Arm robotic mission.

Nasa was also working on a mission concept that would fully enclose a large asteroid using an inflatable system and the other would capture a smaller boulder from of a much larger asteroid using robotic arms. 

The Arm crewed mission, in which astronauts will explore the redirected asteroid around the moon, provides unique opportunities to test human spaceflight capabilities as well.

The papers detail current work underway at Nasa to upgrade spacesuits in preparation for the first spacewalks in deep space since the 1960s and farther from Earth than ever before.

Concepts for new hardware to dock the crewed and uncrewed spacecraft together are also in development.

This will allow the crew aboard Orion to attach to the Arm robotic spacecraft and study the asteroid.

This could be later used to connect Orion with a deep space habitat or 'stepping stone' on its way to Mars, or even station cargo and fuel depots in strategic places such as lunar orbit.

Astronauts returning home with samples from Mars will hold a treasure trove of research scientists will study to unlock new knowledge about Mars and the solar system's history.

Various techniques for deflecting a potentially hazardous asteroid could be tested on Arm to enable planetary defense capabilities.

These techniques include Ion Beam Deflection, Enhanced Gravity Tractor, and kinetic impactors.

In Ion Beam Deflection, the plumes from the thrusters would be directed towards the asteroid to gently push on its surface over a wide area. A thruster firing in the opposite direction would be needed to keep the spacecraft at a constant distance from the asteroid.

The Ion Beam Deflection approach is independent of the size of the asteroid, and it could be demonstrated on either mission option. 

In the Enhanced Gravity Tractor approach, the spacecraft would first pick up a boulder from the asteroid's surface as in mission Option B. The spacecraft with the collected boulder would then orbit in a circular halo around the asteroid's velocity vector. 

The mass of the boulder coupled with the mass of the spacecraft would increase the gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and the asteroid. 

By flying the spacecraft in close formation with the asteroid for several months the very small gravitational forces would produce a measurable change in the asteroid's trajectory.

A kinetic impactor could also be launched as a secondary payload with the spacecraft or on a separate launch vehicle, and it would collide with the target asteroid at high velocity while the spacecraft observed the impact. 

As well as this, returning asteroid samples will help Nasa develop  tools and techniques for future space exploration.

This early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space.

Rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air, drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel.
