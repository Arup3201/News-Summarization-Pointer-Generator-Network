Unhappy: Embattled Tory chairman Lord Feldman has angrily denied making the comments and hinted that he may sue over newspaper reports

Embattled Tory chairman Lord Feldman is to avoid a party investigation into claims he described grassroots activists as ‘mad, swivel-eyed loons’.

The peer, one of David Cameron’s closest friends in politics, has angrily denied making the comments and hinted that he may sue over newspaper reports.

Today the Conservative Party Board rejected calls from senior backbencher Brian Binley for an internal investigation into the claims.

Downing Street has weighed in behind him, saying the Prime Minister accepts his assurances that he did not make the comments to journalists he encountered in a Westminster restaurant last week.

But some senior Tories last night cast doubt on his denials, and he faced close interrogation over the affair when the Conservative Party board held its monthly meeting in London this afternoon.

Ahead of the meeting Mr Binley said: ‘I simply do not believe that senior journalists would make up such a remark.

‘I’m afraid that among the leadership there has been a disdainful view of the voluntary party. I have made that complaint again and again.

‘I am certainly going to be raising it at the party board meeting – it is so insulting. I want answers.’

Former Conservative Cabinet minister David Mellor said Lord Feldman should follow through on his threat to sue if he genuinely did not use the contemptuous phrase.

Mr Mellor said: ‘He strenuously denies it but, if so, I have to say as a former lawyer . . . sue them. Where is the writ? I think we will find the writ will not appear.’

Newspaper accounts on Saturday did not name Lord Feldman, but said the source of the story had ‘strong social connections to the Prime Minister and close links to the party machine’.

Lord Feldman is reported to have dismissed last week’s Tory rebellion on Europe, saying: ‘It’s fine – there’s really no problem. The MPs just have to do it because the associations tell them to do it, and the associations are all mad, swivel-eyed loons.’

Hours later Lord Feldman issued a statement denying he had made the comments, after he was named on Twitter as the likely source.

He said: ‘This is completely untrue. I did not nor have ever described our associations in this way or in any similar manner. Nor do these alleged comments represent my views of our activists.’

Lord Feldman, 47, is one of the Prime Minister’s closest political allies. The pair met at Oxford and have remained friends and tennis partners for years. Lord Feldman was made co-chairman of the party in 2010 and handed a peerage later that year.

Downing Street said Mr Cameron backed his friend and believed his denials. A No 10 source said: ‘We absolutely believe Andrew. It is completely untrue that anyone in Downing Street has made those comments or held those views.’

Another senior figure close to the discussions about Lord Feldman acknowledged he could be a ‘bit of a blabbermouth’, but insisted he would not lie.

The source added: ‘Did he say something a bit injudicious? Possibly. Did he say what’s been ascribed to him? Nobody thinks so.

‘He insists that he did not say those words. Andrew is nothing if not honest. The Prime Minister has known him for years and he believes his account.’

Friends: Lord Feldman is one of the Prime Minister David Cameron's closest political allies

The Times and the Daily Telegraph, which both reported the story on their front pages on Saturday, said they stood by their stories.

Ben Harris-Quinney, director of the organisation Conservative Grassroots, said there was now a ‘crisis of conservatism’, with the leadership disconnected from the party on issues like gay marriage and Europe.

Mr Harris-Quinney said: ‘It doesn’t matter who made these comments, the problem is that it comes as no surprise and is representative of a wider malaise in the party – the disconnect between the leadership and the grassroots, between conservatism and the leadership of the Conservative Party.

‘The tail cannot continue to wag the dog. We need to drop or heavily amend policies like gay marriage that aren’t conservative.’

Senior Tories last night said there was unlikely to be any action against Lord Feldman.

One said: ‘Even if he did say it, which he denies, the fact is Andrew is the Prime Minister’s friend and confidante. He also raises a lot of money for the central party and keeps the Cameron operation afloat.

‘We literally cannot afford to lose him, which is what makes the whole thing so complicated and difficult.’

Mr Mellor suggested the Prime Minister was wrong to appoint a personal friend to such a senior role.

‘I am old enough to remember the days when the Tory Party chairman was a serious political figure and  chosen because they were a serious political figure,’ he said.

‘If it was him – as newspapers suggest – then this has been a disaster waiting to happen because you cannot elevate  tennis-playing friends to be chairman of the Conservative Party without there being a political price to pay.’
