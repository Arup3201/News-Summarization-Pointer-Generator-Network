It earned its place in history as the site where Churchill helped mastermind Britain's victory over Hitler. 

But now the former War Office, which boasts more than 1,000 rooms, has been sold and could become a luxury hotel.

The iconic building, in Whitehall, London, contains a wealth of history, having been a key site during both world wars and home to secretaries of state including Lord Haldane, Lord Kitchener and David Lloyd-George.

The old War Office in Whitehall in London, where Churchill came up with plans to defeat Hitler, has been sold on a long lease to overseas developers and could become a luxury hotel or transformed into apartments

It was built in 1906 at a cost of £1.2million and has been sold for £300million to overseas property developers. 

The Grade II-listed, 580,000 sq ft property has been described as one of the biggest 'trophy assets' sold by the government in recent decades.

It was sold as part of the Ministry of Defence's cost-cutting programme, and staff are expected to move out of the building during the next year.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'The building has played an important part in our country's history and now presents a unique redevelopment opportunity in the heart of Westminster.

'The purchaser will be granted a new 250-year lease to ensure that the heritage and security of the building is well managed.'

The Old War Office has previously been closed to the public but as part of the sale it is understood that access will now be granted.

The old War Office in Whitehall was an impressive building when it was built in 1906 for a record £1.2m

The building has two and a half miles of corridors and more than 1,000 rooms making it able to be developed 

The old War Office site, which has more than 100 years of history, could become a luxury hotel in future

It has 1,100 rooms and two and a half miles of corridors, and is expected to be converted into a hotel and luxury flats with a combined value of £1billion.

The building has been sold on a long-lease to the India-based Hinduja Group in partnership with Spanish group Obrascon Huarte Lain Desarrollos. 

It is made of 25 million bricks and 30,000 tonnes of Portland and York stone and is a minute's walk from Downing Street, The Houses of Parliament, the Horse Guards Parade and Nelson's Column.

William Young was commissioned as architect of the war office in 1898 but died two years later. 

The work of designing the iconic building was completed by his son Sir John Taylor. 

Former Prime minister Winston Churchill used the  War Office in Whitehall during World War Two

It was designed in a trapezium shape to maximise the usage of the land in Whitehall. 

The building took five years to be completed from the first brick being laid in 1901 until it was finished in 1906. 

Several fine marble fireplaces were incorporated into the rooms from the former war office in Pall Mall and all are more than 200 years old. 

The War Office has been home to several notable secretaries of state including Lord Haldane, Lord Kitchener, David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill.

With the start of World War One the staff of the War Office increased, with different teams spread throughout London. 

In October 1940 four bombs hit the War Office, causing superficial damage and killing one person. 

It was hit by a further seven bombs over the course of the Second World War but damage to the building remained minimal.

The War Office declined greatly in importance after the First World War, a fact illustrated by the drastic reductions in its staff numbers during the inter-war period. 

On April 1 1920, it employed 7,434 civilian staff; this had shrunk to 3,872 by April 1 1930. Its responsibilities and funding were also reduced. 

However it remained the centre of the Army's administration until the Ministry of Defence unified in 1964 and most of the department transferred to the main MOD building.
