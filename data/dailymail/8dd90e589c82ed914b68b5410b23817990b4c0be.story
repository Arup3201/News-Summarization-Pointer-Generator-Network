Twiggy has been in fashion for decades and now she's revealed the rules she abides by when it comes to her timeless style.

The 64-year-old model revealed the secrets to her fashion success in an interview for the March issue of Woman & Home magazine.

And her top style rule is that your wardrobe should not be restricted by your age.

Still in style: Twiggy has been modelling since she was 16

'I don't like it when people say "you're 45, so you should be wearing X and never Y". For me, dressing is about attitude, not age,' she said.

She added that size is not important when it comes to looking good.

'We all have bits that we don't like but you don't have to be a size 10 to look wonderful.

'The trick is to find the style that is right for you. When it comes to trying new clothes my advice is not to take it too seriously - it's all about having fun.'

Be adventurous: The designer said women shouldn't be afraid to wear bright colours

She's been in the modelling industry since the age of 16 and has learnt the best kind of style involves taking risks.

'Be adventurous and experiment – don't be afraid to try something new. But if you do feel nervous, start with one on-trend item and build your outfit around it.

'Buy a colourful accessory – bright shoes will give you an instant confidence boost,' she recommended.

The Marks and Spencer designer often makes colour one of her wardrobe staples and hasn't shied away from as she's aged, wearing a hot pink lace dress to her daughter Carly's wedding last summer. She received so many compliments that she has now launched it as part of her new M&S collection.

'For special occasions I love pretty 
dresses – but nothing too frou-frou! When I was planning my outfit for 
Carly's wedding last summer, I wanted something simple, chic and easy to
 wear.

'I thought of the black lace dress from my last winter collection 
but I thought "I can't wear grey or black to my daughter's wedding! How 
about hot pink?" The wedding was in the Cotswolds and it was 84 degrees.
 Everyone loved my dress so we are launching it online in February!'

She admits that she doesn't believe in the urban fashion myth that black flatters everyone, and will always opt for a brighter colour.

'Yes black is slimming but it's not always youthful. The right tone of red, however, is flattering on all women.' 

Twiggy's collection for M&S follows this ethos revealing pops of red and leather skirts rather than black pullovers and loose-fitted shirts. The model will also open a pop up boutique at the M&S marble arch store on February 27th.

Unlike with many other celebrity clothing lines, Twiggy is quick to point out that she's had a lot of involvement when putting together the collection and that she only designs pieces she would wear herself.

'Even before I was discovered in 1966, I used to make my own clothes. I learned how to sew early on and it's still my passion now. I constantly have ideas in my head about clothes so jumped at the chance to do my own collection and am very hands-on. Everything I design I wear and I love.'
