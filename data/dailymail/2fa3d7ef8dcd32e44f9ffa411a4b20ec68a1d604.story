The colourful flash of a red squirrel in the trees is a spectacle few Britons have had the pleasure to witness.

After more than a century of decline, experts say the plight of the native red squirrel may have finally turned a corner.

Fewer than one in 20 of us in Britain have ever seen the distinctive animal, according to a recent RSPB survey.

Research by Red Squirrel Northern England reveals that the animals have been spotted in parts of the Yorkshire Dales, the North Pennines and Lancashire for the first time following a century of decline

But it could be an increasingly common sight after conservation work has helped the native species make a comeback in areas where it has not been seen for years.

Research by Red Squirrel Northern England reveals that the animals have been spotted in parts of the Yorkshire Dales, the North Pennines and Lancashire for the first time in decades. 

The success is mostly down to a huge effort to control invasive grey squirrels, which were introduced to Britain from America in 1876 but carry a pox virus that is fatal to its red cousin.

As a result grey populations grew to 2.5 million while the number of red squirrels fell to 120,000 – mostly in Scotland. 

Just 15,000 remained in England – mainly in northern areas like the Lake District and Northumberland. 

None exist in the South, apart from isolated pockets on the Isle of Wight and Brownsea Island, Dorset.

However, conservation work has helped boost populations, which grew by seven per cent last year.

The latest work reveals that the number of reds in the North held steady – but they have expanded their territory.

New sightings this year include Upper Swaledale in Yorkshire, Teesdale in County Durham and Ormskirk in Lancashire.

Despite the grim historic trends, experts say efforts to control and cull greys is paying dividends.

Colonies are stable in Cumbria and Northumberland, according to Red Squirrel Northern England.

Nick Mason, project manager at Red Squirrels Northern England, told the Daily Mail: ‘In several areas, red squirrels appear to be re-establishing range long since lost.

‘Time will tell how persistent these new pockets of red squirrels are but they are all close to areas where high quality conservation work is in place. We think this is really exciting!’

A recent Liverpool University study found some red squirrels in northern England may be becoming immune to the squirrel pox virus. The more likely reason for the boosted figures are huge efforts to control greys.

Dr David Bullock, head of nature conservation at the National Trust, said: ‘It looks like we might be turning a corner with red squirrels. There is optimism, cautious optimism, but definitely optimism.

‘Personally, I have never been more positive about the future of red squirrels. It is down to some really hard work.

‘This doesn’t mean that we can be complacent. We still need to manage grey squirrels and there are huge areas of Britain where we have no red squirrels at all.’

He added: ‘Removing grey squirrels seems to be key. We have seen that when you remove grey squirrels, you get red squirrels coming back - it is that simple.’

Prince Charles recently ordered a cull of grey squirrels on his Duchy of Cornwall lands, and the Government is encouraging others to follow suit.  

The Forestry Commission agrees that controlling grey squirrels is essential if red squirrels are to thrive.

Earlier this month it published a new policy offering landowners grants of £100 a hectare to shoot grey squirrels.

It has also insisted that landowners have a plan in place to reduce grey squirrel populations if they want to apply for other woodland funding.

The Forestry Commission had considered making it a legal requirement that all landowners shoot a certain number of grey squirrels a year, but that plan was ruled out after a public consultation.

The new policy says ‘incentives’ are key to reduce grey squirrel populations.

It adds: ‘Where grey squirrels are causing problems, land owners and managers are critical to the success of policy implementation by taking responsibility for controlling grey squirrels on their land.’
