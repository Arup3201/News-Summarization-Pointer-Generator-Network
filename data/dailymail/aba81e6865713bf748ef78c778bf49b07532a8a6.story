Those worried about the long-term health of A-list actresses such as Renée Zellweger, who famously lost and gained weight twice for her Bridget Jones role, should spare a thought for the boys, too.

After shedding almost 2st  last year as he slimmed down from being a muscle-bound Thor to star in Rush, the movie about trim British racing driver James Hunt, Chris Hemsworth has been asked  to lose the pounds again for his new film  called Heart Of The Sea.

He may seem in peak condition now, but could these extreme regimes increase the risk of serious illness in later life? 'Chris and I both have to lose as much weight as possible over the next month,' says his co-star Joseph Mawle, who is best known for his role as Benjen Stark in Game Of Thrones.

'We play these guys who are stranded on a boat, so we have to look really worn-down and skinny. It's not a great look, but Chris will still be his handsome self.'

Joseph and Chris might heed the warnings of actor Tom Hanks, who ruled out ever again taking film roles that require dramatic body transformations after developing type 2 diabetes. The Captain Phillips  star believes the diagnosis may be connected to him changing his size for roles such as Castaway and A League Of Their Own.

While crash-dieting can be damaging due to dehydration and malnutrition, the adverse effect on the body of bouts of weight gain is cumulative. Dr David Haslam, clinical director of the National Obesity Forum, explains: 'In overweight people, if you lose 2st then gain it again, then lose it again and gain it again, the damage is equivalent to gaining 4st on top of whatever you already weighed. The body starts to release chemicals that cause inflammation, which increases the risk of heart disease and possibly diabetes too.'

Australian star Hemsworth, 30, will be packing on the protein again soon, though, to play Thor in the next Avengers film.

First-born children are 'smarter' than younger siblings, according to the US National Bureau of Economic Research. The results of a survey showed that first children typically get  better grades in school and have higher IQs. The economists  who wrote the findings concluded that parental discipline is strongest in the eldest child.

With the paparazzi constantly capturing his bare torso as he sprawls on a super-yacht surrounded by women, it's little wonder that Simon Cowell is willing to try a new fitness fad. Along with pal Sinitta Cowell is now using Technoshape, a fat-blasting stomach belt that promises to increase blood circulation and shift flab from the tummy. It is worn while doing exercise, such as on a treadmill or stationary bike. But physiologist Professor Michael Rennie believes users may be wasting their time. 'Stimulating the blood supply won't make you lose weight,' he says. 'There are  only two ways to get rid of fat  - eat less or exercise.'

Soundwaves are being used to treat painful carpal tunnel syndrome. The wrist condition causes pain, numbness and tingling in the fingers. It is associated with obesity, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, arthritis and diabetes.

Research has shown that when splinting (immobilising the wrist, which is the most common treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome)  is combined with ultrasound, it is three times more effective.  Now therapeutic ultrasound is being employed in a clinical trial at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust.
