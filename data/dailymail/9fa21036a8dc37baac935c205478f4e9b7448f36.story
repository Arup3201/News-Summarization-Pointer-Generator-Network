Prosecutors have dismissed all the criminal charges against a New Jersey man and instead indicted two police officers for falsifying reports - one with aggravated assault - after a dash cam proved the defendant was innocent.

A third officer has pleading guilty to tampering with evidence and retired from the forice.

Marcus Jeter, 30, was facing years in prison on charges of eluding police, resisting arrest and assault.

However the stunning dashboard footage - obtained by WABC New York - showed the Bloomfield DJ had done nothing wrong and exposed police brutality at its most serious.

Caught: Footage obtained by WABC seemingly shows officers hitting Meter in the head

'I'd be in jail if this tape hadn't surfaced,' Marcus Jeter, from New Jersey, said this week

The incident occurred during a traffic stop on the Garden State Parkway in 2012.

Police had earlier been called to the nearby home that Jeter shares with his girlfriend but, after a brief exchange, no charges were filed and he left.

The tape shows Jeter pulling over being punched in the head repeatedly.

Without the tape, prosecutors had been demanding a five-year prison sentence.

Jeter can be seen with his hands throughout the video.

The footage also shows him pulling straight over, despite being charged with elluding.

A tape not initially turned over shows a second police car coming from the opposite direction, crossing the median into ongoing traffic, and then striking Jeter's car.

'It was incredible, I didn't believe it at that point in time,' he told WABC.

'The next thing I know, one of them busts the door and there is glass all over my face.

'As soon as they opened the door, one officer reached in an punched me in my face.

'As he's trying to take off my seatbelt, I'm thinking something is going to go wrong.

The video shows the officers telling Jeter to stop resisting, however he doesn't appear to be fighting back.

'All I keep saying is I'm not doing anything,' Jeter said.

'They handcuffed me and one of them hits me in the back.'

The prosecution had not seen the video despite pushing ahead with their charges against Meter.

Interestingly, an earlier investigation by Bloomfield Police Department's internal affairs division found no wrongdoing by the officers involved.

Prosecution were pursuing a five year jail sentence for Meter.

Charged: Orlando Trinidad, the officers featured most prominently in the videos, has pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault, falsifying reports, conspiracy and official misconduct

Bloomfield police officer Sean Cotter has been charged with conspiracy, falsifying reports and official misconduct. He has pleaded not guilty

However all charges were dropped this week once the videos were produced in court.

On Friday the two officers shown predominantly in the footage, Sean Cotter and Orlando Trinidad, were charged with falsifying reports, conspiracy and official misconduct.

Trinidad was also charged with aggravated assault.

They have both pleaded not guilty to all charges.
