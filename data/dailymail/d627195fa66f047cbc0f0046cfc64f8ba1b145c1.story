George Ford is an artist and a pragmatist rolled into one and the England fly-half is quickly discovering that the latter trait is a more consistently valuable asset in international rugby.

The 21-year-old Bath playmaker spends most weekends with his club demonstrating the range of his attacking game — as a creative rookie able to unravel defences at close quarters. He has shown that part of his repertoire during this RBS 6 Nations, but is also having to embrace the earthier demands of his role, involving substance over style.

England’s defeat by Ireland in Dublin gave Ford a first-hand view of Jonny Sexton, the home fly-half, following orders to the letter and quelling his own instincts in the process. The Lions No 10 led an aerial onslaught which the visitors failed to handle.

George Ford is prepared to sacrifice style over substance in the quest for victories at international level

Asked whether he would feel fulfilled if ordered to kick so often, Ford said: ‘It was obviously Ireland’s plan. If they come in with a plan and execute it as well as they did and come out with a 10-point win, then you would (feel fulfilled). You don’t always have to play the same way against different teams.

‘You go into a game with a plan and if it comes off at the weekend, you feel you’ve done your job.’

But surely he gains more satisfaction from conjuring tries than kicking for territory? ‘People always like to score tries,’ he added. ‘They are more exciting. But they are difficult to get in international rugby.

‘It’s about small margins, little things; your kicking being on the money, your set-piece and breakdown being strong.

‘The fancy things come from the foundations being in place.’

The substance versus style issue will be on the agenda again in assessing how England fare on Saturday against Scotland at Twickenham, where they will be expected to win with plenty to spare against opponents who have lost all three games so far.

Ford knows the result is the bottom line, but is aware the hosts need to perform with a flourish too.

‘We’re not going into the game to play averagely,’ he said. ‘We’re going into the game looking for a really good performance. That will always be our aim. First and foremost we need the win. It’s vital we get it. But obviously we want to go out there and put in a good performance and have a good reaction.’
