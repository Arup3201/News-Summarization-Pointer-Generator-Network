The line-up for 2015 Betway Premier League Darts has been announced with Stephen Bunting and Kim Huybrechts among those in the 10-strong list.

Last year’s winner Raymond van Barneveld has been named among six wildcard selections alongside Bunting, the man he beat 5-4 in the quarter-final of the World Darts Championship at the Alexandra Palace.

Among the other wildcard picks are Peter Wright, Dave Chisnall, Huybrechts and James Wade. Wade, the 2009 Premier League winner, returns after making it to the World Grand Prix final and winning The Masters.

Order of Merit Top Four: Michael van Gerwen, Phil Taylor, Gary Anderson, Adrian Lewis

Wildcard Selections: Peter Wright, James Wade, Dave Chisnall, Raymond van Barneveld, Kim Huybrechts, Stephen Bunting

The four automatic qualifiers were Phil Taylor, Adrian Lewis, Michael van Gerwen and Gary Anderson, the latter fresh from winning £250,000 and his first world title on Sunday night over The Power.

Huybrechts joins the 16-week race for the Premier League title for the first time with his most memorable moment of 2014 a nine-darter over Van Gerwen as he beat the Dutchman in the Grand Slam of Darts in November.

PDC chairman Barry Hearn said: ‘The competition for places in the Betway Premier League Darts has been greater than ever this year, and there was a huge amount of deliberation over a host of players for selection.’ 

Phil Taylor is one of four automatic qualifiers for the 16-week race for the Premier League Darts title
