They are one of Britain's most successful companies - not to mention tastiest - and have been operation for nearly 200 years, so it may come as a surprise to learn that Cadbury has never had a Christmas advertising campaign - until now.

Filming got underway in South London today, as the Bournville firm looks to break the habit of a lifetime and cash in on the lucrative festive market for the first time.

Bosses are keeping tight-lipped about 
the details of their ad - these pictures show the the lengths they are 
prepared to go to in order to keep it under wraps.

'Unwrapping Christmas': A street in South London will be the stage for Cadbury's first Christmas advert

Under wraps: The details of what happens in the advert are being kept a closely guarded secret

Iconic: The street scene, including cars and vans, has been completely covered in the famous Dairy Milk purple

A whole street of terraced housing in the suburb of Woolwich has been covered in purple fabric, the colour of the popular Dairy Milk bar.

The multimillion pound advertising push is built around a theme of 'Unwrapping Joy' and, in another first, the advert will star Cadbury fans as opposed to actors.

Marketing manager Rick Lawrence said: 'It’s no secret that chocolate plays a starring role in most UK households during the festive period and this, our first ever Christmas advert, is set to highlight that very special relationship between Cadbury and Christmas.

'These photos reveal the early stages of the shoot that we’re very excited about. More news on this will follow in the coming weeks, so watch this space and your TV screens for our joyful Christmas commercial.'

Groundbreaking: Cadbury has been making chocolate for more than 100 years, but this is their first Christmas advertising campaign

Careful planning: Set designers could be seen dressing the terraced houses in Woolwich

The full details of what happens in the 
advert are being kept a closely guarded secret. Quite what has happened 
to the homeowners is also a mystery.

According to Marketing Week, the confectionery giant - now owned by US firm Kraft - has revamped its product line in order to begin promoting its products earlier than in previous years.

In an interview, Mr Lawrence told the publication the brand had not been given a reason to exist other than the 'same old reason all year round' in past years.

He explained Christmas was a 'huge' 
opportunity to push its products in a market that is estimated by Mintel
to be worth nearly £4billion.

He said: 'Products like advent calendars and buttons are designed as stocking fillers for mum to give to their kids.'

Mr Lawrence added: 'As a season we would love Christmas to be a bit more like Easter. Easter has the benefit of being a 12-week season and we would love Christmas to emulate that.'

Investment: The Christmas advertising campaign is said to be costing the confectionery giant millions of pounds

Residents: Cadbury has refused to divulge where the homeowners have gone and whether or not they are being paid

Operation: The filming and set design can be seen from several streets away
