Zarko Udovicic, a footballer who was threatened at gunpoint after missing a crucial penalty during a game for Novi Pazar FC in Serbia

A Serbian footballer was threatened by a fan who forced his way into a dressing room  and held a gun to his head because he missed a penalty during a match.

Zarko Udovicic handed in an immediate transfer request after several men, who were furious with the defender for missing the spot kick in the 85th minute of a game against Rad FC in Belgrade, burst into Novi Pazar FC's training ground. 

The incident happened two days after the match when the fans kicked down a door and grabbed the player, pointing a gun at him and threatening to kill him for what he had done.

As soon as he was released, the 27-year-old announced he had asked for his contract to be terminated and handed in a transfer request.

The president of the football players union in Serbia Mirko Poledica confirmed the incident saying: 'I don't want anyone to think that this behaviour is typical of fans here, this was an isolated incident and they were hooligans who will be caught and punished.

'A complaint has already been made to police after they levelled the gun at his head and threatened to kill him.'

He also called on the Serbian Football Association and the Serbian League to take action.

Mr Poledica added: 'What worries me is that there is no reaction from the football association. They remain quiet.

'They must do something to guarantee the safety of the players. But they don't. Next time a player could be murdered.

'The only positive thing from this situation, is that our Deputy Prime Minister (Rasim Ljajic) has spoken out and acknowledged the serious problems we are facing. 

In the match against Rad FC, the defender stepped up to take a penalty in the 85th minute but sent his effort over the bar 

After missing, the player was seen walking away with his head hanging as a rival player waves his fists in his face in celebration

'In Serbia, no fan has ever been prosecuted or convicted after violent behaviour against a football player. That's why players are afraid.

'Each day they hope that there will be nobody knocking on their door to beat them up, that there will be no person setting their car on fire, or that there will be no hooligan putting a gun to their head.'

A video of the penalty shows Mr Udovicic player walking away after missing a goal with his head hanging, as a rival player runs alongside him celebrating the miss by waving his fist in celebration in the unfortunate player's face.
