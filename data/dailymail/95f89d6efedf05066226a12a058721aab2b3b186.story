Seeded bread is the best thing since the sliced white loaf, it seems.

Sales of the staple have soared by almost a third (31 per cent) in the past year as shoppers opt for healthy wholegrains over processed white bread.

Seed bread is popular with dieters as it releases energy more gradually, leaving you satisfied for longer. It is also very high in nutrients.

Popular: Seeded loafs have been flying off the shelves across Britain

Fruit loaves are flying off the shelves, too, with sales of bread with dates and cranberries up 37 per cent.

The figures, published by National Craft Bakers’ Week, show the bread market is worth £2.1billion in total.

Cake is close behind at £1.8billion, with traditional British treats gaining ground over American snacks.

Doughnut sales rose 3.3 per cent last year and cookie sales by 5.2 per cent, but both were soundly trumped by classic favourites scones (19 per cent), Eccles cakes and hot cross buns (both 8 per cent).

Ivor McKane, chair of National Craft Bakers’ Week emphasised how demand has increased.

He said: 'Bakers from across the country are seeing a huge increase in demand from their customers for more speciality breads.

'This is for health reasons as well as taste but it’s great to see traditional items such as Eccles cakes and teacakes in increasing demand.

'However, despite this growth in sales, it is still vital that the public support their local craft baker.

'This will ensure that these products continue to be available on the high street.

Support: British shoppers are being urged to buy a loaf from their local baker this week

'Being a craft baker requires an immense amount of skill and dedication and often recipes are passed down through the generations.

'But whilst many have been in business for decades, they need support.

'We would urge the public to visit their craft baker and find out for themselves what they have to offer.'

National Craft Bakers’ Week, which runs from 7-13 October, supports the Teenage Cancer Trust and bakers will be fundraising for the charity.
