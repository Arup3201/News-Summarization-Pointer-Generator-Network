Brendan Rodgers is adamant Liverpool’s dreadful autumn form will not derail their ambitions of ending the season with a top four place.

Such has been the dramatic reversal in Liverpool’s fortunes, Rodgers – who just six months ago was named the LMA Manager of the Year – had to field questions yesterday on how he felt having his odds slashed by bookmakers in the ‘sack race’.

This has been a testing period for Rodgers. Liverpool have not won a game since October 28 in any competition and their struggles have left the Northern Irishman pacing his kitchen in the middle of the night, trying to find solutions to their problems.

So managers can clam up in these types of situations but Rodgers, who will keep faith with under-fire No 1 Simon Mignolet for today’s Anfield collision with Stoke after holding a meeting with him at Melwood, was relaxed as he discussed the shortcomings that have left Liverpool in twelfth place.

More than anything, though, he was resolute in stating his that his side will claw back any lost ground and fulfil the aim of Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owners, and secure a place in next year’s Champions League. For all that they have been wretched, their rivals have not pulled away.

‘I have an inherent belief that we can still make the top four – absolutely,’ said Rodgers. ‘I know what we are all capable of here. For whatever reason, it hasn’t happened for us yet but I said to the players the other night our standards will go up after the game against Ludogorets.

‘Thankfully no matter how we have been, we are still within touching distance and that is the initial aim. Fourth and then moving forward. If that is the aim – and we are only five points off it – then that gives me belief we have every chance of doing it.

‘I am not saying it is going to be easy or hard. We obviously have to pick up form but I saw enough encouragement from the group the other night that we are going to move forward and now is the time to do that.

‘If we put a run of results together then we have the experience from last year. The players went through it and did it then. I have every belief we can do it. Sometimes things are never as bad as people say or write. They are not always as good as people say or write, either.

‘For me, stay calm. We will be better for sure and let that be seen on the field in their actions. I am satisfied that all I can do with what I have is the best I can possibly do. When you do that and put hours and hours into your work and study and manage to motivate players that makes you relaxed.’

He is also realistic. Rodgers recognises how capricious football can be and for all that he has the unequivocal backing of FSG’s leading men, John W Henry, Tom Werner and Mike Gordon, a couple of positive results are required to turn down the noise others are making about his future.

‘I know I will fight for my life to be here for as long as I can; if there is a rocky spell then that is something you never like as a manager,’ said Rodgers. ‘You never like seeing or hearing things like you are the bookies favourite to get the sack when six months ago I was Manager of the Year.

‘But that is modern football. All I can do is my best and I will continue to do my best. While I do that, I will always be relaxed knowing that whenever that time comes from the owners, whether it is in a month or 10 years, I’ll walk out of here having given my absolute all. I am happy with that.’

On Sunday, Liverpool lost 3-1 to Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park - but Rodgers insists they can make top four

One thing Rodgers has not lost through all this is his confidence. Sir Alex Ferguson revealed in his autobiography that his belief in his ability was rattled early in his career after enduring a month without winning but Rodgers has not lost sight of what he is trying to achieve.

‘I have faith in my methods and a way of working,’ said Rodgers. ‘We have been given a different deck of cards and, as a coach, I have to do what I think gets the best out of them. I have methods, a belief and a philosophy but you also have to get results. I am not a fantasist.’

It will take time for them to find the sparkle of last year but not losing is the immediate priority and it remains to be seen whether Rodgers will reward Lucas Leiva for an encouraging return to action in the 2-2 draw with Ludogorets with his first Barclays Premier League start since September 20.

‘I am 27 now and probably my best years are still to come,’ said the Brazilian, whose long-term future is still uncertain. ‘Of course I want to play. The day that I walk into Melwood and feel ok about not playing? That is not me. I am not the type of person who just wants to collect his money.

It is not me and has never been me. Of course I am not happy not to be playing. When you play, you feel that you can help the team and you feel better.’
