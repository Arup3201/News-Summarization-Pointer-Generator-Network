Manny Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach has started work on a game plan for the Filipino star's proposed £200million mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

Although no official confirmation has been forthcoming, Pacquiao is expected to face Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2.

And Roach has revealed he has identified sparring partners that can mimic the pound-for-pound No 1's unique style.

Pacquiao (left talking to Floyd Mayweather last month) is confident he will fight his rival on May 2

'I honestly feel the fight is going to happen,' he told SecondsOut. 'Floyd has talked on TV twice at the basketball game, which is very unusual.

'Bob Arum wants the fight, I want the fight and Manny wants the fight; a lot of good names want this fight and usually when these high people want it, they get it.

'I've done some research on Floyd and on sparring partners. This is going to be the biggest challenge ever but I think my guy can pull it off but it wont be easy.

'It's a very tactical fight and I have to come up with a great game plan.'

Pacquiao also posted a message on Instagram which confirmed he is in training for his next fight and teased his fans it will be against Mayweather.

Mayweather, here with Rihanna at the All-Star Saturday Night, said he is hopeful the fight will take place

He said: 'Off to work now but after few days back to serious training for my up coming m... fight. Thank you Lord.' 

Mayweather admitted on Sunday that neither party has signed a contract for the fight but that he is 'hopeful' a deal can be struck.

Talks have been ongoing since the pair came face-to-face at a basketball game in Miami last month. They later held talks in Pacquiao's hotel suite.

Mayweather is expected to earn the lion's share of the revenue after Pacquiao agreed to a 60/40 split in his rival's favour.

A drug-testing regime has also been agreed while Showtime and HBO are expected to broadcast a joint pay-per-view as they did for Mike Tyson vs Lennox Lewis in 2002. 

Pacquiao has agreed that Mayweather will be the one to announce the fight. 

Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November
