Jose Mourinho is certainly an outspoken man but Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois claims the boss rarely directs his wrath at the players regardless of whether his stars make a costly mistake.

Mourinho has been known to clash with opposition managers and officials but Courtois insists his patience and support for the squad is the key behind their continued progress this season, as Chelsea stand five points clear the top of the Premier League.

The Belgium international, who has missed the last three Chelsea games with a thumb injury, revealed the squad feels confident as a result of the trust Mourinho places within his players.

'When you know you've got the 100 per cent backing of the coach, it gives you a lot of confidence,' Courtois told the Sun. 

'You can make a little mistake and he won't say anything to you,' added Courtois. 'When you don't have his trust you can be all over the place.'

Chelsea face a trip to Anfield to take on Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday evening, with Mourinho's men still in with a chance of four titles this season.
