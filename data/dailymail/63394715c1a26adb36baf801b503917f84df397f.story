Trapped: 1,132 Britons had to be rescued from the toilet this year

Around three Britons a day had to be rescued this year after becoming trapped in toilets.

Firemen attended 1,132 incidents involving people unable to extricate themselves from public toilets or their own bathrooms, while one woman called for help after becoming wedged on a lavatory seat, a freedom of information request revealed.

Most of the toilet rescue missions were in London, where crews were called out 395 times.

Figures revealed firefighters rushed out 41 times on Merseyside, 31 times in Cheshire and 27 in South Wales.

In Northern Ireland, an obese 30-year-old woman had to be prised out of a toilet seat using 'manual handling techniques' after becoming 'wedged.

A man from Guildford, Surrey, had the ignominy of being rescued by the fire service after accidentally locking himself in a ladies loo.

In Barnstaple, North Devon, fire crews had to remove a toilet seat which became stuck on the head of a child.

And a Cardiff woman needed rescuing after becoming trapped between a toilet and a wall after falling over.

Mick Flanagan, 52, a fire and rescue investigator in South Wales, said it was mostly youngsters rescued after getting trapped in toilets - but not always.

He said: 'We had a lady who had fallen between a toilet and a wall and we had to dismantle the toilet.It was a bit comic at the time because she was a bit tipsy and laughing.

'We just unbolted the toilet which gave her and us space to help her up. Thankfully she wasn't injured.

'Most of our calls to bathrooms are children who have shut the door, locked the door and couldn't open the door - and a panicking mum calls us out.

'We would either put a ladder through the window or put a foot through the door.'

Figures showed there were 1,132 cases across England, Wales and Northern Ireland of people becoming stuck in toilets and bathrooms.

Call out: Firemen said most of the calls were from panicked mothers, whose children had locked themselves in the bathroom

A spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said those most at risk from a home accident are the 0-4 years age group and the over-65s.

She said: 'During these early years, babies begin to develop and grow more adventurous and inquisitive, and all of a sudden everyday household objects can become potential hazards.

'This is why parental supervision is important.

'Falls account for the majority of non-fatal accidents and many of the fatal and non-fatal accidents to older people are attributable wholly or in part to frailty and failing health.

'This can lead to failure or slowness to see and avoid risks.'
