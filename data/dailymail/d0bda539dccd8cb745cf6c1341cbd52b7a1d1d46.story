Egypt's interim head of state has timetabled an election date for next year, leaving the country facing months of violent protests  following the military ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi last week.

In an attempt to drag the Arab world's biggest country from crisis a decree issued by Adli Mansour pointed to a parliamentary ballot within about six months with a presidential vote to follow.

But senior officials in Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood rejected the plans with leading figure Essam al-Erian saying the blueprint for constitutional changes 'brings the country back to square one'.

Tension: Supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsi protest as army soldiers guard at the Republican Guard building today

Bloody: Egyptian security forces killed dozens of supporters of Egypt's ousted president in one of the deadliest single episodes of violence in more than two and a half years of turmoil

It came as Egypt's interim president named the former finance
minister Hazem el-Beblawi as prime minister in a transitional 
government, The Telegraph reported.

The need for a political breakthrough is pressing.

At least 51 people were killed on 
Monday when the army opened fire on Morsi supporters camped outside 
Cairo's Republican Guard barracks where the deposed leader is believed 
to be held.

The military said it opened fire in response to an attack by armed assailants.

On Friday, clashes between pro- and anti-Morsi supporters swept Egypt and left 35 dead.

Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood movement 
called for more protests on Tuesday, raising the risk of further 
violence, although an umbrella group representing anti-Morsi protesters 
said they would not demonstrate.

U.S. officials say they're reviewing developments in Egypt, but the 
White House and State Department strongly backed continued U.S. military
and economic assistance to Egypt.

'I'll be blunt - this is an incredibly complex and difficult situation,'
White House press secretary Jay Carney answered when asked whether what
occurred in Egypt was a coup.

'There are significant consequences that 
go along with this determination, and it is a highly charged issue for 
millions of Egyptians who have different views about what happened.'

He added, 'It would not be in the best interests of the United States to immediately change our assistance program to Egypt.'

Congress, like the administration, is trying to reconcile democratic principles and U.S. interests.

Obama and his national security team have condemned the violence, which 
killed at least 51 Islamist protesters and three security forces on 
Monday alone, but haven't condemned the military for seizing power.

Several lawmakers have followed that lead, rejecting any immediate move 
to cut off aid at a time when the Muslim Brotherhood is calling for 
all-out rebellion against the army and any power vacuum could be filled 
by Islamic militant groups that might threaten stability in the Arab 
world's most populous country, or in Israel next door.

The administration insisted Monday that it won't withhold funds from Egypt's army after its second takeover of a civilian government in the past 29 months. Most of the money goes to the military under an arrangement U.S. leaders have honored since Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., lamented Monday: 'In Egypt, governments come and go. The only thing certain is that American taxpayers will continue to be stuck with the $1.5 billion bill.'

The bloodshed has shocked Egyptians, 
already tired of the turbulence that began 2-1/2 years ago with the 
overthrow of autocrat Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising.

It also raised alarm among key donors 
like the United States and the European Union, as well as in Israel, 
with which Egypt has had a U.S.-backed peace treaty since 1979.

Millions of people took to the streets
on June 30 to demand Morsi's resignation, fearing he was orchestrating a
creeping Islamist takeover of the state - a charge the Brotherhood has 
vehemently denied.

But for many Islamists, the overthrow 
of Egypt's first freely elected president was a bitter reversal that 
raised fears of a return to the suppression they endured for decades 
under autocratic rulers like Mubarak.

Protesters said Monday's shooting 
started as they performed morning prayers outside the barracks.

But 
military spokesman Ahmed Ali said that at 4 a.m. (0200 GMT) armed men 
attacked troops in the area in the northeast of the city.

Emergency services said 435 people were wounded.

At a hospital near Cairo's Rabaa 
Adawiya mosque, where many of the wounded and dead were taken, rooms 
were crammed full, sheets were stained with blood and medics rushed to 
attend to those hurt.

'They shot us with teargas, birdshot, rubber bullets - everything.

Then they used live bullets,' said Abdelaziz Abdel Shakua, a bearded 30-year-old who was wounded in his right leg.

Mustafa Shalaby, a young doctor at the
hospital - one of at least three places where casualties were taken - 
said he counted 45 dead and more than 400 wounded.

A Reuters journalist at the scene saw first aid helpers attempting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a dying man.

Film broadcast by Egyptian state TV 
showed Morsi supporters throwing rocks at soldiers in riot gear on one 
of the main roads leading to Cairo airport.

Young men, some carrying sticks, crouched behind a building, emerging to throw petrol bombs before retreating again.

The graphic scenes came just three 
days after Cairo, Alexandria and other cities and towns were rocked by 
running street battles between Morsi's supporters and opponents, which 
went on for hours despite a heavy military presence.

Mansour decreed that Egypt will hold 
new parliamentary elections once amendments to its suspended 
constitution are approved in a referendum - a process that could take 
about six months, less than some people had expected.

However, it was faulted for repeating flaws in the 2011 transition plan that contributed to the current crisis.

In what appeared to be an olive branch
to Islamists, the decree included controversial language put into the 
constitution last year that defined the principles of Islamic sharia 
law.

Whether that will be enough to lure 
back the hardline Islamist Nour Party, which had supported the 
military-led transition plans until Monday's attack, remains to be seen.

Nathan Brown, a leading expert on 
Egypt's constitution at George Washington University in Washington, said
that while Monday's decree laid out a clear sequence for transition, it
repeated many of the mistakes of the post-Mubarak process.

'It was drawn up by an anonymous 
committee; it was issued by executive fiat; the timetable is rushed; the
provisions for consultation are vague; and it promises inclusiveness 
but gives no clear procedural guidelines for it,' he told Reuters.

The Brotherhood movement has refused 
to have anything to do with the process, and thousands of supporters 
have camped out in northeast Cairo for the last five days and vowed not 
to budge until Morsi returns as president - a seemingly vain hope.

The events have worried Western 
allies. The United Nations said it was 'gravely concerned' about 
mounting violence in Egypt and said the country was on a 'precarious 
path.'

'The Secretary-General condemns these 
killings and calls for them to be thoroughly investigated by independent
and competent national bodies,' it said in a statement.

The United States, still refraining 
from calling the military intervention a 'coup' - a label that would 
trigger legal obstacles to continuing aid payments - called on Egypt's 
army to exercise 'maximum restraint.'

The White House said it was not about to halt aid to Egypt.

The Egyptian military, recipient of 
$1.3 billion a year from Washington, has insisted that the overthrow was
not a coup and that it was enforcing the 'will of the people' after 
millions took to the streets on June 30 to call for Morsi's resignation.
