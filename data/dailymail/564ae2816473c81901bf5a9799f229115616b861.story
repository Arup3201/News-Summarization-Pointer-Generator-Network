Kimani Gray, 16, was fatally wounded late Saturday evening in Brooklyn after allegedly pointing a handgun at undercover police officers

A teenager in New York City was shot and killed by undercover police last night after they say he pointed a gun at them.

Kimani Gray, 16, was shot in the leg and stomach when he pulled out a .357 revolver in East Flatbush, Brooklyn

Police say they came across a group of young men on Saturday evening when Gray began walking away from his friends as he saw police arrive.

Officers say the 16-year old began to adjust his waistband and started to act suspiciously.

Gray
then turned around and pointed a .357 caliber gun at them. When the two
plainclothes officers saw the weapon they responded by opening fire and
shot him.

The teen was rushed to Kings County Hospital but later died.

According to witnesses, when the two 
cops arrived on the scene in an unmarked car, Gray was part of a group 
of six teenagers standing by the side of the road.
