Dull train journeys have become a thing of the past in one Chinese city where  carriages have been decorated with intricate 3D designs for a very unusual reason.

The stunning art in the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line in the city of Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province was actually advertising sanitary towels, according to The People's Daily Online.

Photographs of the beautifully decorated carriages were shared widely on social media and the PR stunt, which coincided with International Women's Day, won praise from commuters.

Rainforest: One of the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line has been made to look like a rainforest with green designs on the floor, walls and ceiling

Psychedelic: Each of the carriages contained different images, ranging from traditional blossom trees to more psychedelic designs

Tao Chin, a spokesman for the underground line, said: 'We wanted to make the experience of travelling on carriages more enjoyable, and so the 3D effect covering various subjects was introduced with a good reaction from our customers.

'We make sure that the decorations cover not just the walls but also the windows, doors and roofs to maximise the effect.'

There were five different themes used, including an amusement park, European castles and a fairy tale world.

Passenger Sying Tsao told local media: 'I didn't see them advertising things and then suddenly when I turned up for work one morning I saw that the carriages had this great new 3D designs. 

'They were very realistic, I saw one child nervous about stepping on a 3D floor.

'I have seen three or four different designs, I like the cherry blossom best because I haven't seen any so far this year, and it was really nice and calming, not just for me but for everyone on the tube I think.'

Mr Li, manager at the care products company's head office, said using 3D adverts in the carriages not only promoted their products, it also encouraged the 'heads-down generation' to look up and enjoy the scenes around them.

But while the colourful designs were appreciated by commuters, most had not realised the carriages were actually advertising sanitary towels.

Some took to online message boards to express their shock that they had been surrounded by such adverts. 

'We make sure that the decorations cover not just the walls but also the windows, doors and roofs to maximise the effect,' Tao Chin, a spokesman for the underground line, said
