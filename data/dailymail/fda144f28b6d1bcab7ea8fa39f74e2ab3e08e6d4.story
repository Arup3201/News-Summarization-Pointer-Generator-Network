What was the most talked about event of this year? Barack Obama being  re-elected? Perhaps it was the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee river pageant?

Nope. It was, according to Twitter, Boris Johnson’s ‘dad dancing’ at the Closing Ceremony of the Olympics.

The social networking site’s annual review, published yesterday, revealed the Mayor of London’s gyrations sparked more posts per second in Britain than any other event in 2012 as TV viewers rushed to share their laughter.

The UK's most Tweeted moment: Boris Johnson shakes his hips to the Spice Girls as he and Prime Minister David Cameron and their respective wives watch the London Olympics Closing Ceremony this summer

The pain: Italian midfielder Andrea Pirlo kicks 
and scores a penalty past Joe Hart during the quarter-final penalty 
shoot out which knocked England out of Euro 2012 in June - the UK's second most tweeted moment

Usain Bolt's victory in the 100m at the London Olympics and Ella Henderson's shock knockout from the X Factor made up the third and fourth most important moments on the league table of most tweeted moments

He danced with David and Samantha 
Cameron during the Spice Girls’ performance which amassed more than 
116,000 ‘tweets’, or Twitter messages, in the world per minute.

After Mr Johnson’s dancing the next 
biggest ‘spike’ in UK Twitter conversation came when England lost to 
Italy on penalties in the Euro 2012 quarter-finals, followed by shock 
from X Factor fans when James Arthur, the show’s eventual winner, and 
Ella Henderson ended up in the bottom two, thus facing elimination from 
the competition.

Overall, the 16-day Olympics generated the biggest conversation of the year with 150million tweets across the globe.

Mr Obama’s ‘four more years’ comment 
on his re-election as US President became the most  re-tweeted of 2012 –
and the most re-tweeted ever – after it was re-posted by 810,000 people
in more than 200 countries. Re-tweeting is sending someone else’s 
message to people who follow your account.

What Got Us All Tweeting

Comic: Mr Bean's Chariots of fire sketch at the Opening Ceremony was another Olympic moment in the top ten

Most retweeted worldwide: Barack Obama's succinct missive to announce his victory in the 2012 election was shared more than any other Tweet published this year

Multimedia: Will.i.am's Tweeting during live shows on BBC's The Voice caused fury among some viewers, but it gave a new dimension to the television broadcast

Innovative: On the day of the Skyfall premiere in October, author and comedian Charlie Higson translated the original 12 Bond novels into 140 character Tweets

#PrayForMuamba: Jermain Defoe's Tweet was just one of more than 700,000 sent following footballer Fabrice Muamba's heart attack on the pitch in March

The review also threw up some surprises. The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee is a notable absence among the most discussed topics.

Samantha Brick, whose ‘why women hate 
me for being beautiful’ article was published in the Daily Mail, is in 
fifth place in the   ‘issue of the year’ category, after Prince Harry’s 
deployment to Afghanistan. The NHS topped the list. The Paralympics was 
found to be the top ‘trending’ sports topic of the year, pushing the 
Olympics into fourth place. Trends on Twitter reflect the hottest 
emerging topics, rather than what has been consistently popular over 
time.

Analysts believe the Paralympics 
gained first place because people used its full name in Tweets, whereas 
many Olympics posts referred to ‘the Games’ or ‘Team GB’, which could 
have reduced the statistics for ‘Olympics’.

David Cameron, who joined Twitter in October, topped the poll of UK political trends.
