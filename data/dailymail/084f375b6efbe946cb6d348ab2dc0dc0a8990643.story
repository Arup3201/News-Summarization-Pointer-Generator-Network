The Government unlawfully censored an embarrassing report about the controversial HS2 rail project, it is claimed.

Patrick
 McLoughlin, the Transport Secretary, employed a special veto used in 
wartime to stop the release of a damning internal report about the 
planned High Speed 2 line.

In
 an unprecedented move, Christopher Graham, the Information 
Commissioner, has announced that he will seek a judicial review of the 
veto.

The Government is set to face High Court challenges after ministers used a wartime veto to censor information about the controversial HS2 high speed rail project

Mr Graham said he had ‘not taken the 
decision lightly’, but added that it was a matter of principle since the
 censorship was ‘unlawful’.

He said ministers had acted unreasonably because there was ‘no demonstrable flaw in fact or law’ in an earlier order to publish.

In
 January, Mr McLoughlin used a rare emergency veto to ban publication of
 a Project Assessment Report on the £50billion rail line.

The
 Information Commissioner had ruled six months earlier that the findings
 must be published. But the Government refused to comply – first 
appealing against the decision, then imposing the veto.Anti-HS2 campaigners accused the Government of censorship.

They
 suspect that the report undermines the case for the project and should 
be published in the public interest. It is believed to contain 
‘red/amber’ warnings, which suggest the scheme could be in danger of 
failing.

The information Commissioner Christopher Graham and campaigners including Warwickshire GP Paul Thorton have launched legal action, with Mr Graham calling for a judicial review

But ministers argued the report on 
the rail line, planned to connect London with Birmingham and the North, 
was confidential advice to them from civil servants.

Mr
 Graham has raised the stakes, announcing in a letter to Sir Alan Beith 
MP, the Justice Committee chairman, that he will challenge the veto in 
the High Court.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told Parliament he was imposing the veto on the report which labelled HS2 in danger of failing

Mr McLoughlin has insisted it was ‘in the public interest’ to block publication of the document.

Justifying
 his ‘exceptional’ decision, he said that protecting the impartiality of
 civil servants’ advice to ministers must take precedence over 
disclosure to the public.

But
 furious protesters said it was the first time the secrecy laws had been
 invoked since the Iraq War. They branded the gagging order ‘absolutely 
disgraceful’ and said it was a ‘delaying tactic’ ahead of a 
parliamentary vote on HS2.

Announcing
 his legal challenge, Mr Graham said: ‘The information in the HS2 
Project Assessment Report is all environmental information, and my 
decision notice of 6 June 2013 (his earlier ruling on publication) was 
issued in exercise of my obligations under the Environment Information 
Regulations.

‘Therefore under UK law as it  currently stands . . . the Secretary of State’s veto of my decision  is unlawful.

‘The
 reasons given for the HS2 veto do not amount to reasonable grounds, as 
they merely express disagreement with the reasons given in my decision.’

He
 added that he had taken into account a recent Court of Appeal decision 
that it was wrong for Attorney General Dominic Grieve to prevent the 
publication of 27  letters written by Prince Charles to ministers.

Mr
 Grieve used a veto to stop the letters – which were said to be lobbying
 on climate change – being published under a Freedom of Information 
request.

That Court of 
Appeal judgment, which is still subject to appeal to the Supreme Court, 
states that using the ministerial veto on environmental information is 
incompatible with European law.

Campaigner
 Richard Houghton, of HS2 Action Alliance, said: ‘So far as we can see, 
the last time secrecy laws of this nature were invoked was during the 
Iraq war. The implications are immense.’
