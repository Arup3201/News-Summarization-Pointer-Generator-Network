This is the moment a carer stealing money from a frail pensioner was caught on camera - after the victim’s worried family installed CCTV to catch her.

Claire O’Hara, 37, was filmed rummaging through the possessions of great-grandfather Patrick Murray, 79, who she was supposed to be looking after.

His family who suspected that money was going missing at his care home in Middlesbrough had installed a camera.

She was supposed to be looking after Patrick Murray, 79, but his family suspected that money was going missing

A court was told the 'kind and funny' great-grandfather was left traumatised by the ordeal and the theft on March 25

In the 
footage, O’Hara can be seen entering Mr Murray’s empty room and looking 
for the key to his safe, opening it and removing an item believed to be a
 wallet.

Mr Murray died three months after the crime but he lived long enough to give evidence to help convict her of theft.

Today,
 she was sentenced at Teesside Magistrates' Court to an 18-week jail 
sentence, suspended for two years, with a 12-month supervision 
requirement.

She was also ordered to pay £850 costs.

Previous
 hearings were told the 'kind and funny' great-grandfather  was left 
traumatised by the ordeal and the theft on March 25.

On the day 
of the theft, the anniversary of Mr Murray's wife's death, his 
daughter-in-law arrived at 11.30am to go for a day out, setting the CCTV
 running.

'Kind and funny' great-grandfather Patrick Murray was left shocked after a care home worker stole from him

Claire Louise O'Hara was found guilty of theft over the incident at Stainton Way Care Home in Coulby Newham, North Yorkshire

Mr Murray's daughter Christine Coulton and son Michael Murray said he was never the same after the theft

It was later discovered that £40 was missing.

O'Hara,
 of Thornaby, North Yorkshire, claimed to police that Mr Murray had asked
 her to take the money to buy gifts for his twin baby 
great-grandchildren and that he suffered with memory problems.

But
 in his statements, Mr Murray, who died on July 1, two days after his 
80th birthday, said: 'I'm 79 years old. I get £30 a week wages, which is
 kept in my wallet in the safe in my room.

'I
 did not give Claire permission to take money. I'm very upset and 
disturbed as I thought she was a lovely lass. I'm finding it hard to 
describe how I'm feeling.

'The fact that someone who I liked could do this has made me feel traumatised.'

O'Hara, who had worked at the home for eight years, repeated her claims that she had been told to take the money at her trial.

Speaking 
after O'Hara was found guilty, Mr Murray's daughter Christine Coulton said: 'He came
 to the care home after my mum Joan died - they were married for 58 
years so that hit him hard and he was in a bad way.

'But
 he really picked up with the care he got and came through it. We have 
to say, we don't want people to tar the whole care home with the same 
brush. The care he received - even from Claire - was perfection.

'All these young girls looking after him, he was in his element. he liked it there.

'We chose Stainton Way because it appeared to be - and was proven to be - the best. I looked at a lot of homes.'
