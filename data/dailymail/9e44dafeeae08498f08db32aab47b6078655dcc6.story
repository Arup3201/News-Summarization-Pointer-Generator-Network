From performing at the BRIT Awards to hosting Saturday Night Live for a record fifth time, singer Justin Timberlake has had a busy time of late.

Now it seems that his workload is set to become a little lighter as the singer is set to sever ties with his William Rast clothing line, according to a report in the New York Post.

Launched in 2005, the casual wear brand was set up with the help of Timberlake's best friend Trace Ayala who currently heads the label.

Named after the pair's grandfathers, the label met with critical acclaim at the outset but sales are believed to have slumped in recent years.

Timberlake's punishing work schedule, which includes an upcoming tour to promote new album 20/20 with rapper Jay-Z, and his newly wed status are also whittling down the amount of time the newly crowned 'King of Pop' has for his fashion brand.

But according to the New York Post, the main reason for Timberlake's departure is the uphill struggle the brand faces in order to get back on track.

'Not a lot of retailers wanted it,' a source told the paper. 'Because the perception is [Justin’s] not involved, so why would anyone want to wear it?'

Timberlake has also been busy with his acting career, which took off after the singer turned actor played Napster founder, Sean Parker, in 2010 film, The Social Network.

Although the singer himself has remained tightlipped about the rumours, a Rast spokesman didn't deny Timberlake's departure, when asked by the New York Post, saying only that JT was 'eternally' connected to the brand.

This, they continued, is because it's 'a combination of Justin’s grandfather’s name and Justin’s best friend’s grandfather’s name.'
