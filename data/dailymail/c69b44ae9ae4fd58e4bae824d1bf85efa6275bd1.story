A man has died at a Utah spin-off of the iconic Burning Man festival after appearing to run into a ceremonial bonfire on Saturday night.

The man who has not been identified was too fast for bystanders to stop as he sped into a burning 30-foot tall effigy built to represent a character from the book 'Where the Wild Things Are.'

The apparent suicide at the Element 11 off-shoot of Burning Man in Tooele County happened around 11 pm after the art project was set on fire.

Prior event: Element 11 is part of the series of events that leads up to Burning Man in Black Rock, Nevada and just like that famous event - effigies are burnt (the one pictured is not the effigy that the deceased approached)

'The nature of the fire is such that our volunteers were not able to get close enough to the fire for risk of their own safety,' said Element 11 spokesman J.P. Bernier.

Element 11 hosted more than 1,200 attendees and is a precursor to the famous Burning Man, held in held in Black Rock City, Nevada.

'He was very fast; he was very motivated. It wasn't an accident or any act of negligence on anybody's part. He had a very deliberate objective to get past our volunteers, past our safety perimeter.'

Grantsville police confirmed that a man had died, but would not confirm it was suicide nor his identity.

Many at the event on Saturday night were left distraught by what they saw, including a photographer named Christian who spoke to Deseret News.

'I did see that a lot of the community was shocked and traumatized,' he said.

'There's a lot of questions, a lot of facts that are unknown.'

Officials said there were between 25 and 40 volunteers forming a perimeter around the fire to prevent people from getting too close.

Those nearby attempted to shout at the man and even chase him, but could not stop him.

Element 11 officials delivered a verbal statement Sunday to FOX 13 News’ Robert Boyd regarding the incident:

'This is a deeply upsetting event with tragic results, our hearts go out to the Utah community and the attendees of Element 11.

'This is a tragic event and we struggle to respond to it we ask for your patience while we find the appropriate resources but please know we are committed to supporting those who are affected by this event in the best way we can.'
