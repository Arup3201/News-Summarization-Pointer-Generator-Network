A Premier League academy footballer is today being held over the killing of his 15-year-old girlfriend who was knifed to death at a house party.

Stoke City midfielder Andrew Hall, 18, was arrested after Megan-Leigh Peat was attacked at the gathering in the early hours of Saturday.

The young footballer has not yet been questioned by detectives as he is being treated for a partially severed finger.

Arrest: Andrew Hall, 18, who plays for Stoke City's under 18 team, is being held over the killing of Megan-Leigh Peat, 15, right, who was stabbed to death at a house party in Ampthill, Bedfordshire

It is believed Megan, who wanted to train as a midwife, had been in an on-off relationship with the suspect.

Megan's father David, 39, laid a floral tribute to his daughter at the scene of the murder in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, yesterday.

A card attached to it said: 'Megan 
Moosay, miss you more than words can say. You will always be in my 
thoughts and forever in my heart. Love you forever, Dad.'

Megan’s devastated father and her mother Nicola, also aged 39, faced the grim prospect today of viewing the schoolgirl’s body.

At the family home, where Megan lived 
with her mother, brother and her mother's partner, a relative said: 
'Megan’s mum and dad are going to see her in hospital today.

'It’s been pretty full on recently. They are just not ready to talk about what happened. It’s still just so soon.'

At the family’s red-brick home, tucked
away behind hedges, in Westoning, Bedfordshire, a window box had been 
placed outside and was today filled with bunches of flowers laid in her 
memory.

Friends and relatives also turned the 
front garden of the semi-detached home where she was killed into a 
memorial to her life, with touching handwritten messages, lanterns and 
floral tributes.

Rumours spread among friends who 
arrived with flowers yesterday that the arrested man was Megan’s 
boyfriend, named locally as Andrew Hall.

Hall plays for the Stoke City 
under-18s team. He scored a crucial goal earlier this year to send his 
team through to the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup.

A spokesman for the club told The Sun:
'the club are not prepared to comment at this stage other than to say 
that the thoughts of everyone here are with Megan's family at this 
tragic time.'

Some of the teenagers who attended the
party on Friday night and Saturday morning had been seen reportedly smoking 
cannabis in the cellar bar of a nearby pub in the hours before the 
attack.

It is believed Megan had gone to the house with at least one friend and may have been joined by others later.

Paramedics went to the house at 1.30am
after calls saying a girl had been fatally injured. Despite attempts to
revive her, she died at the scene.

Police arrested the suspect in a nearby street shortly after the stabbing.

A trail of blood ran from the house and a neighbour's Vauxhall Astra had blood spattered on the tyres.

One resident said a woman in her 40s and her teenage son had moved into the rented semi-detached house around three months ago.

She added: 'They seem like a nice 
family. I don't see much of them but when they moved in they did the 
front garden up so they are obviously house-proud.

'The boy has friends round in boy 
racer cars and you hear the odd blast of loud music but that is all. 
They have been no trouble.'

Another said he had heard loud music 
coming from the house on a number of occasions but had not noticed a 
party at the property on Friday evening.

Emergency: Police and paramedics were called to the house in the early hours of Saturday and arrested a suspect nearby

House of horror: The party at which the girl died was held by a boy whose parents are on holiday

Megan's friend Chelsie McAneny, 16, 
said her classmates at Harlington Upper School were planning to release 
balloons in  tribute to her.

She added: 'She was the hero  at school. Everybody loved her  and knew her.

'She would stick up for everyone and 
was a great friend. She was really funny, sociable and bubbly. I can't 
believe what happened and still don't. It doesn't feel real.

'She was a pretty girl, very bubbly. You could hear her a while away.

'She loved children and wanted to be a midwife when she left school.'

Lorraine Adams – mother of Megan's best friend Dee, who was not at the party – said: 'She was such a beautiful girl.

'It has knocked everybody sideways. It's a great loss to everybody. She was a fantastic person.'

On her Bebo account Megan wrote that she was happiest when she was with 'my friends or with family or at a party'.

Tragedy: The girl was stabbed at a part at this house in Ampthill, Bedfordshire. Police forensic officers have been scouring the scene

Search: Forensic investigators comb the scene to piece together the events leading up to the 15-year-old's fatal stabbing

Police said this afternoon that Megan-Leigh lived with her mother, brother and her mother’s partner in Westoning.

'Her father and his partner live in 
Flitwick. Both parents are being supported by specially trained Family 
Liaison Officers from the Beds, Herts and Cambs Major Crime Unit 
(BHCMCU),' said the spokesman.

'Megan-Leigh died after being stabbed 
at a house in Ailsbury Road, in Ampthill at around 1.30am. She had gone 
to the property, which belonged to a mutual friend, with an 18-year-old 
male having spent the evening with him at various pubs in Flitwick and 
Ampthill.

'There had not been a party at the house, contrary to earlier news reports.

'An 18-year-old male was arrested 
shortly after the incident on suspicion of murder, but due to an injury 
that he had sustained, was taken to hospital for medical treatment.

'He remains in hospital under police guard and has not yet been interviewed in connection with the incident.

'Megan was a pupil at Harlington Upper
School. Students there are currently being supported by the staff. 
Flowers and messages of condolence are being left outside the property 
in Ailsbury Road.'

A post mortem examination was due to be carried out by a Home Office pathologist.
