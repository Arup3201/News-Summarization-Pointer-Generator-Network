The head of Boston's transit agency has abruptly quit her $220,000-a-year job after the closure of the area's transport service for more than 24 hours twice in the last fortnight.

Beverly Scott, 63, general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, announced her resignation in a letter to the board.

She gave little explanation for her reasoning, but said she would work until April 11 to enable a smooth transition. 

Beverly Scott, 63, general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, has resigned after coming under fire for the closure of the transport service in the greater Boston area twice in two weeks

Boston has been hit by extreme weather in the last month which has ground its public transport to a halt

The 'T' decided to suspend rail service completely Tuesday to try and recover from the extreme weather

In her resignation letter she said: 'During these past two years-plus, it has been an absolute pleasure and honor to serve with and lead this dedicated team of transit professionals and public servants.

'In my almost forty years in this industry, I have not worked at a public transportation system with such a personal connection to the people and communities it serves.'

Her decision comes after another tough week for the transit agency. The 'T' decided to suspend rail service completely Tuesday to try and recover from the extreme weather.

Charlie Baker, the governor of Massachusetts, expressed his dissatisfaction earlier this week at the closure of the transit system, describing the MBTA's performance 'unacceptable'.

But he said Scott was doing everything she could to deal with the 'unprecedented' weather conditions.  

Scott's resignation came a day after she offered an impassioned defense of the 'T', citing historic snowfall and years of under-investment.

'We are running an extremely aged system that is getting a pounding,' Scott said, adding that it needs 'serious, bold' reinvestment to operate reliably.

Amid the snowfall, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, called the MBTA's performance 'unacceptable'

The storm on Tuesday left the Boston-area with another two feet of snow and forced the MBTA to run buses on a limited basis, and suspend all rail service for the day  to clean tracks and repair equipment

But following her departure, it was revealed Ms Scott had jetted off at taxpayers' expense almost every month since she took the job in December 2012. 

A review of her monthly expense reports by the Boston Herald reveals she spent 106 days travelling out of state, taking 30 trips in 24 months.   

During that time, Ms Scott racked up $56,753 in expenses on lodging, airplane tickets and dining tabs, including at least $1,132 on hotel laundry and dry-cleaning bills. 

Her impending departure leaves the MBTA, which includes the country's oldest subway and a network of buses, ferries and commuter rail lines, without a long-term leader. 

'I suspect that she didn't see any light at the end of the tunnel,' said Robert Prince Jr., who led the T from 1997 to 2001 and considers Scott a friend. 'And if she does, it's another train coming at her.'  

In a statement, the MassDOT board's chairman, John Jenkins, said he was 'stunned by the resignation of Dr. Scott.'

He added: 'Be clear, this Board has had no discussions at any time about her tenure as General Manager. 

'We hoped and expected that she would fulfill her three year contract, which ends in December of this year. 

'I want to thank Dr. Scott for her skillful and committed leadership over the last 26 months, and wish her the very best as she moves on to her next challenge.
