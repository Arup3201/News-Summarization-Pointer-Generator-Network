A children's play centre has barred fathers from attending with their children and is now facing an investigation by equality watchdogs.

Kids Go Wild is believed to be the first such play centre in the country to introduce a ‘women only’ policy – which also bans boys over the age of nine.

Bosses at the centre, which opened less than a fortnight ago, claim the policy was instigated for ‘cultural reasons’ and was in the interests of the ‘predominantly Asian’ local community.

The Sparkhill centre's website describes how Kids Go Wild is the 'UK's first ladies and children's only soft play centre'

Even so, yesterday Muslims in the 
Sparkhill suburb of Birmingham were among those who condemned the 
restrictions, which were advertised on a poster outside the centre.

It reads: ‘Ladies and children only. No boys over nine allowed.’

Councillor Habib Rehman, a Muslim 
father-of-four, said it was a ‘worrying situation’.

He added: ‘There’s 
something wrong when a dad can’t take his kids to a play centre.’

Ruksana Ayub, a Muslim mother-of-one, said while Muslim women may feel 
‘more able to relax’ in a setting where they don’t ‘feel they have to 
cover up’, she thought it ‘quite shocking in this day and age that men 
aren’t allowed in’.

Another resident, who only gave her 
name as Gemma, said: ‘I have four boys, luckily all under the age of 
nine, but if one of them was older, I wouldn’t be able to take any of 
them.

'It’s not fair to leave one of them out.’

The children's play group has sparked a row after it banned fathers from attending with their youngsters

According to the 2001 census, Muslims 
make up 54 per cent of the 30,000 population of Sparkhill – more than 
double the number of Christians.

The Equality and Human Rights 
Commission yesterday said that under the Equality Act 2010, single sex 
rules should be ‘the exception not the norm’.

The manager of Kids Go Wild, who would
not give her name, said: ‘It’s a predominantly Asian community here and
we’re catering for that.

'It’s not that men are an issue, ladies are 
more comfortable around women. Ladies have not questioned [the ban]. 
They’ve been asking for it.’

Emma Cross, of Manchester-based law 
firm Pannone and a specialist in discrimination law, said: ‘Under the 
Equality Act it can be lawful to limit your services to one gender or 
religious group, but you must be able to “objectively justify” what you 
have done.

‘To my mind it would be difficult for 
the centre to show it has met this test when it could have offered 
women-only sessions or days of the week instead.’

An Equality and Human Rights 
Commission spokesman said: ‘The Equality Act does allow for some 
services to be just for women or men-only, but this is the exception not
the norm and must pass a strict test to be justifiable.

‘We will look into why Kids Go Wild is
a women-only service.’ If the commission’s lawyer considered the play 
centre’s policy to be discriminatory, it would ask Kids Go Wild to 
change it, the spokesman added.
