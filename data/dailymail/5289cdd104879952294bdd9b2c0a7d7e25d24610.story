Moors Murderer Myra Hindley did show remorse while in jail – but only for the death of her pet dog, according to a letter published for the first time today.

Hindley, who along with her lover Ian Brady was jailed for life for the murders of five children in the 1960s, wrote that the thought of her beloved dog ‘Puppet’ reduced her to tears.

In a letter to Brady’s mother Margaret written on Thursday 2 December 1965 she wrote: 'I haven’t yet received the ‘report’ on the dog. They were quick enough to kill him, but are taking their time about giving me the report.' 

It has been revealed that Myra Hindley was reduced to tears in jail when she learned that her beloved dog Puppet had died 

She added: 'However I can’t dwell on this subject for very long, it hurts too much to even think about Puppet without crying.'

The 23-year-old who was just four months away from being found guilty of one of the most infamous and sadistic crimes in British legal history does not make any reference to her offences in the letter which was written from her cell at HM Prison Risley.

Instead she recalls at length the relationship she and Brady, then 27, shared with their family pets including Mrs Brady’s own dog Bruce.

She wrote: “I know you understand how Ian and I feel about this as you thought so much of Bruce, that you know how a dog who is part of the family can mean so much. Ian was terribly upset about Bruce when he died but he wouldn’t show it.” 

In the handwritten letter which has been obtained by this newspaper under freedom of information laws Hindley recalls how Puppet and the dog’s mother Lassie could barely contain their excitement when she and Brady returned home from work.

She wrote: 'At night when we returned from work, the dogs would hear the car doors slam and Lassie, the devil, would actually jump onto the table under the window, wagging her tail and barking, and Puppet would run in the hall, stand on the 3rd (sic) stair and stick his nose through the letter box. As soon as we’d opened the door, he’d fly to Ian, nearly knocking him over and then run for his stick (which Ian made specially for him) and drop it at Ian’s feet and would keep picking it up and dropping it until Ian picked it up.'

Hindley who had been in a relationship with Brady for almost six years also recalls how they would take the various dogs out on trips to the countryside in the months leading up to their arrest.

She wrote: 'Puppet could nearly talk, he was such an intelligent dog. It got so that we had to spell the word (walk) ‘out’ if we wanted to say it, for the very mention of the word, he would bark madly and run for his stick.

'Every time I had a photo taken with Bruce, I had to bribe her (Lassie) with Smartie’s. She wouldn’t leave Ian while he just took a photo. She had me scratching her tummy for hours while she lay on Ian’s knee in the back seat. She was a lovely little dog. I used to laugh at her heavy feet they always reminded me of a chicken.'

It is impossible to reconcile the couple’s obvious love for the pets with the depravity of their crimes which were committed on and around Saddleworth Moor between 1963 and 1965.

The pair who were initially charged with the murder of Edward Evans, Lesley Ann Downey and John Kilbride and the court heard a tape recording of the ten year old Downey pleading for her life.

Brady was found guilty of all three murders and was sentenced to three concurrent life sentences and Hindley who was found guilty of the murder of Evans and Downey was sentenced to two concurrent life sentences. She was sentenced to another seven years for harbouring Brady in the knowledge that he had killed Kilbride.

The pair escaped execution because the death sentenced had been abolished while they were on remand.

Hindley’s frustration about the police’s failure to hand over the file on her dog’s demise is in stark contrast to how she made the families of other victims wait decades before revealing their fate.

Only in 1985 did she and Brady admit their role in the death of two other children Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett.

In the letter Hindley bemoans the fact that her former work colleagues are now enjoying the five day week she campaigned for.

She said she could ‘kick herself’ for missing out on the concession and finishes off her letter by adding: 'Its just one rotten thing after another. Still, not to worry we’re not dead yet... Love Myra.'

Hindley died in 2002 at the age of 60 and Brady, now 76, was declared clinically insane in 1985. He is now a patient at high security Ashworth hospital.
