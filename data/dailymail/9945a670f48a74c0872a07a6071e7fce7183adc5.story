Worried: David Cameron has held crisis talks at Downing Street after being told of allegations of a sensational love affair which has potentially significant political implications for him

Speculation is rife over the identities of two people allegedly involved in a secret affair which could have serious political implications for David Cameron and his government.

The internet has been awash with rumours since details of the relationship emerged last night.

It comes as David Cameron holds crisis talks at Downing Street after being told of the alleged affair which has potentially significant political implications for him.

For legal reasons, MailOnline cannot disclose the identities of the people involved or any details of the relationship – or even how long it lasted.

It has been said that they are middle-aged figures and that the affair has now concluded.

It does not involve anyone serving in the Cabinet.

Mr Cameron was said to be stunned when he was told the identities of the alleged lovers.

It was said that he ‘immediately realised the importance of the story’.

The Prime Minister and his aides also discussed the possible fallout should details of the affair become public.

The situation was labelled 'dynamite' and a 'complete mess' by senior party sources.

The affair, which was revealed to the Prime Minister within the past few weeks, is also said to have caused ‘great personal distress to innocent parties’.

It is likely to cause a further headache for Mr Cameron, whose leadership is already being tested by backbench revolts over issues such as Europe and gay marriage and rumours of plots being hatched to overthrow him.

On Friday, he faced a further blow when one of his MPs, Patrick Mercer, resigned the party whip after being caught in a cash-for-questions ‘sting’ operation.

The Commons has recently been beset by sex scandals.

Weeks ago Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, a Tory MP, was arrested following allegations that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another between 2009 and 2013 – accusations he has branded ‘completely false’.

A third person has also given a statement to Lancashire police, claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Mr Evans, and on Friday police said they were planning to interview a fourth alleged victim who claims he was intimately groped by Mr Evans in a Commons bar.

In April, Scotland Yard said it had launched a formal investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard.

The Metropolitan Police set up a 
phoneline for alleged victims after a number of women made claims about 
inappropriate conduct by the peer, who was the party’s former chief 
election strategist.

And Liberal Democrat MP Mike Hancock will tomorrow face a disciplinary hearing to determine whether he should lose the party whip over ‘very serious allegations’ of sexual assault.

Mr Clegg asked the party’s chief whip to convene the meeting after Hancock was served papers as part of a High Court civil action brought by a ‘vulnerable’ constituent.

When asked about the affair last night, a Downing Street source said: ‘This is not something we can talk about.’
