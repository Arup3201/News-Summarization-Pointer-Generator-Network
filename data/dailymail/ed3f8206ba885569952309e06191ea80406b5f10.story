A top State Department appointee told Libya's ambassador to the United States one day after the military-style assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi that the
 terror group Ansar al-Shariah was responsible.Â 

But four days later, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations said on television that it was the product of a spontaneous protest.

During a fiery and emotional congressional hearing on the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Rep. Trey Gowdy read aloud from an email dated Sept. 12, 2012 to senior State Department officers, from Elizabeth Jones, the acting Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs.

Describing a conversation she had with then-Libyan ambassador Ali Aujali, Jones wrote in the previously undisclosed email that 'I told him that the group that conducted the attacks, Ansar al-Sharia, is affiliated with Islamic terrorists.'

'Let me say that again,' Gowdy emphasized during the hearing: 'She told him.'

Aujali was Libya's ambassador in Washington, D.C. until November 2012. He was later proposed as a candidate to be the country's foreign minister, but he was never sworn in. News reports at the time attributed his failure to win the job to his history of involvement with the regime of the dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

Acting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Elizabeth Jones told Libya's president one day after the Benghazi attack that Islamic terrorists had killed the U.S. Ambassador and reduced the compound to a burnt-out shell

The State Department's former deputy chief of mission in Libya, Gregory Hicks, testified that 'I was stunned' after UN Ambassador Susan Rice ignored intelligence about terrorist attackers during her television interviews on Set, 16, 2012. 'My jaw dropped. And I was embarrassed.'

President Obama appointed Jones to her post on June 1, 2012, following her service as U.S. Ambassador to Kazakhstan during the 1990s, and as assistant secretary for Europe and Eurasia.

Her email, Gowdy said, went to 'almost everyone in the State Department,' including spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.

Nuland, according to a report in The Weekly Standard, was instrumental in raising red flags about the CIA's candid assessment of how and why the consulate was attacked, which the agency prepared as talking points for members of Congress.

And according to a report from House Republicans released in April, Nuland wrote in an email that 'my building leadership' at the State Department wasn't happy with those talking points.

In the ensuing 24 hours, the talking points were edited heavily, reportedly by White House deputies, and all references to Islamic terrorism were removed.

South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, shown here in a House Oversight committee hearing in 2012, read Jones' email to State Department leaders, in which she recounted her discussion with Libyan president Mohammed al-Magarief

Gowdy's statement came in a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

In the days following the attack, various Obama administration officials said publicly that a spontaneous protest, not a terror attack, destroyed the consulate and killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.

UN Ambassador Susan Rice, in particular, appeared on five Sunday morning political talk shows and repeated that talking point.

Greg Hicks, formerly the U.S. State Department's Deputy Chief of Mission in Libya, testified Rice never spoke with him before appearing on those television programs.

'She did not bother to have a conversation with you before she went on national television?' Gowdy asked Hicks.

'No sir,' he replied.

UN Ambassador Susan Rice said on Sept. 16 - four days after Jones told Libya's president that Ansar al-Sharia had attacked the Benghazi consulate - that a spontaneous protest was behind the military-style assault

Three Benghazi whistle-blowers testified on Wednesday, including Hicks (c), Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Counterterrorism Mark Thompson (L), and State Department diplomatic security officer Eric Nordstrom

Libyan president, Mohammed el-Megarif learned on Sept. 12 from acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Elizabeth Jones that Ansar al-Sharia had attacked the Benghazi consulate

Asked for his reaction when he heard Rice contradict the best intelligence from the CIA and the email from Jones, Hicks said, 'I was stunned. My jaw dropped. And I was embarrassed.'

Asked later in the hearing by Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan about a phone call he had with Jones after Rice's television interviews, Hicks said he asked why Rice said what she did.

"'She said "I don't know." ... The sense I got was that I should stop that line of questioning.'

Hicks also testified that it took 'maybe 18 days to get the FBI team to Benghazi' for an investigation to commence.

'The crime scene was unsecured for 18 days?' Gowdy asked, his voice rising?

'Yes,' came Hicks' reply.

The US consulate compound in Benghazi was reduced to a burnt-out shell after armed terrorists attacked. Hillary Clinton and others in the Obama administration are under fire for failing to prevent the attack, and for covering up its causes

House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (L) invited Hicks to testify. Hicks was the second-ranking diplomatic officer in Libya behind Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who perished in the Benghazi attack
