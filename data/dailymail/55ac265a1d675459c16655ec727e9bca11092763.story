Capt. Larry Etheridge of the Araphoe County Sheriff's office said: 'Allegations were brought forward by a woman, who is now an adult, who had alleged a sexual assault a little more than 15 years ago during a period of time when she was between 14 and 17.'

Etheridge said Bill 'denied it all' and 'did not admit guilt' but refused to go into further details regarding the investigation which launched in June.

According to NBC 9, 'Due to the statute of limitations, Montag is only eligible to be charged with crimes that occurred after July 1st 1996, when the victim would have been 16 years old.'

The victim bravely told she is coming forward after more than a decade in silence to protect other possible victims and young girls.
