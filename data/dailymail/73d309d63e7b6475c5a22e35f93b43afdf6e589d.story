Shamin Husen, 30, claims she was bullied by her manager Talib Hussain, as he banned her from attending prayer and had to ask to go to the toilet

A 'bullying' Royal Mail boss made staff seek permission to go to the toilet and timed how long they went for, an employment tribunal was told.

Somali-born Shamin Husen claimed she was bullied by manager Talib Hussain at the parcel depot in Langley, Berkshire, and is suing the Royal Mail for discrimination on religious grounds.

The 30-year-old told the panel in Reading that she was banned from attending prayer while other Muslims were not challenged and felt she was singled out and picked on.

In her witness statement, she said: 'Talib was horrible. He bullied me, harassed me, intimidated me and victimised me most of the time.' 

Mrs Husen claimed she was made to feel like she could not go to the toilet because her manager would time how long she was gone.

The tribunal heard that she first encountered problems with Mr Hussain in December 2013, when he stopped her from using the bathroom at the depot, which is the main office responsible for sorting all parcels coming into the UK from Heathrow airport. 

Representing Royal Mail, Bridget Tokhai said: 'You claim Mr Hussain stopped you when you went to the toilet and monitored how long you were in the toilet. You say this was all part of him maintaining a watch over you.

'On what basis, apart from the fact that you are a woman and a Muslim, were you made to feel discriminated against?'

Mrs Husen, from Hounslow, replied: 'Because he would not stop men visiting the toilet.'

The tribunal heard that Mr Hussain asked everyone to tell him when they were leaving the work area, whether it was for a smoking break, a comfort break or to attend prayers.

The 42-year-old said he had simply tried to change the 'holiday camp' atmosphere of his section of the depot when he took on the role of manager in October 2013.

'When I came to the manual packets section, it had no standards,' he told the tribunal.

'I went about inputting very, very, basic standards. People should come to work on time, should go to breaks on time and should inform the manager if they are leaving the work floor.

'That's all I wanted to implement. I did continue to get resistance from my staff.'

Mrs Husen said she was challenged when she returned from a toilet break because he believed she had been gone for around 20 minutes.

Ms Tokhai said: 'Mr Hussain says in his statement he would make a mental note if someone was absent from the floor. That is not the same as keeping a watch over someone excessively, is it?

'He is entitled to ask the question if he believed you were away for too long. He didn't stop you from going to the toilet.'

Mrs Husen, who joined the company in 2007 and worked as a manual sorter at the Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre, replied: 'He did.' 

She claims she was subjected to sexual and religious discrimination by Mr Hussain and the Royal Mail group.

Ms Tokhai said: 'What the evidence suggests is that Mr Hussain did not single you out. You were all expected to tell him when you left the floor.'

One month later, in January 2014, Mr Hussain allegedly stopped Mrs Husen on her way to prayers. 

Ms Tokhai said: 'You say you were not able to perform prayers even though other Muslims were going without asking permission.

She worked as a sorter at the Royal Mail depot in Langley, Berkshire, which is the main office responsible for sorting all parcels coming into the UK from Heathrow airport

'What else, apart from the fact you are a woman and a Muslim, made you feel discriminated against?'

She replied: 'I was the only Somali, the only Muslim, in that area.'

Mrs Husen agreed that the reason she was challenged on that occasion was because she had failed to let Mr Hussain know where she was going. 

To this the defence questioned whether this was a reason for him to challenge her and Mrs Husen agreed it was 'but he did not ask others and others did not ask permission.'

Ms Tokhai said Mr Hussain had not singled her out based on her sex or religion. When pushed on whether this was correct, Mrs Husen replied: 'Yes.'

The tribunal also heard Mr Hussain allegedly gave Mrs Husen 'unreasonable' targets, however, Ms Tokhai said: 'You were not the only one who was challenged for your performance. 

'Others were challenged and they were not Muslim employees,' which Mrs Husen agreed with. 

In March 2014, Mr Hussain allegedly isolated Mrs Husen from her colleagues by moving her to a different department. 

The tribunal heard it was common practice for staff to be moved around and Ms Tokhai said: 'He did not move you to isolate you, he moved you because an extra pair of hands was needed. Your sex and religion has nothing to do with it.'

However, Mrs Husen, disagreed with this comment and maintained that her gender and religious beliefs did come into it.

Denying the claims, Mr Hussain said he had never prevented people from going to the toilet, instead asking his staff to let him know when they were leaving the floor for any reason.

'I asked everyone to notify me when they wanted to leave the work floor,' he said.

'It wasn't only for prayers. I didn't ask people to come to me and say, "Please Sir, can I go to pray?"

'As a manager, I need to know where my staff are. I would be held responsible for the whereabouts of my staff.

'I'm not concerned with how long people had been in the toilet, it was knowing where they were.'

He stressed that the depot was a high-security operation, with access controlled biometrically with fingerprints and swipe passes, in which he needed to keep tabs on his staff.

One of his employees at his previous position at airline caterer Gate Gourmet had died in a toilet and wasn't found for six hours after failing to tell colleagues where he was going, he added, which gave him 'alarm bells' if people were gone for a long period of time.

James Khalid, representing Mrs Husen, said: 'Women have complained about you and said you are a bully and that you hate women - that you are a misogynist.

'It's not just one person, or two people, it's a collection, and I'm saying Mrs Husen bore the brunt of it. You harassed her on the basis of her race and religion on a daily basis.

'You stopped her from going to pray, you stopped her from going to the toilet. The effect was to stop her from performing her cleansing for prayer.'

Mr Hussain rubbished the claims as 'ridiculous' and 'vicious lies,' saying he himself was a devout Muslim who prayed five times a day, and had only stopped Mrs Husen to question her movements when she hadn't told him where she was going.

He said: 'I pray in order to earn rewards. If I help someone else pray, I take a share of that reward.

'By stopping someone from praying, I'm committing a sincere, deep sin. I find it ridiculous that someone can say I stopped someone praying.

Mr Hussain, who took the role as manager at the depot in October 2013, denies the claims saying he has never prevented anyone from going to the toilet

'I would just like to know the reason (for leaving the floor), and then I let them go on their merry way.

'Mrs Husen took very strong exception to the fact that I had the gall to even question her movements. I believed I was only doing her job as her manager.'

Mrs Husen continued to work alongside Mr Hussain under investigation until he left the parcels section on June 22, 2014, during which time she alleges he continued to harass her.

However, he said he was advised by his line manager to be careful and avoid communicating with her.

The tribunal heard that a number of other members of his staff of around 20 had made formal complaints about his management techniques, criticising his brusque manner.

He countered: 'What they found problematic was that I managed them. People of all religions.

'I received complaints from all races, religions and genders.'

The manager was dismissed from Royal Mail on November 7, 2014, when his 12-month trial period had ended, and currently has an appeal in process to try and reinstate his position.

Mr Khalid suggested he had lost his job because of his bullying manner towards his employees, which Mr Hussain denied, saying: 'The reason given in my dismissal letter was at the 12 month trial period review, because of unsatisfactory performance, my employment was being terminated.'

He added that 52 per cent of the employees at the sorting centre were Muslim and he would have been 'lynched' if he had been found stopping people going to pray.

'These allegations are false,' he said. 'If they were true, I would really have been concerned for my safety.

'If someone had been stopped from going to the toilet, there would be outrage throughout the plant. It is unheard of.'

Judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto said: 'You say you were moved several times because of your sex and your religion. 

'Do you accept when you were moved there was a legitimate need for you or someone else to be moved at that time?'

Mrs Husen replied: 'No. There was a procedure which was not being followed.'

Government guidelines say workers have the right to one uninterrupted 20 minute rest break during their working day, if they work more than 6 hours a day. 

The tribunal continues.
