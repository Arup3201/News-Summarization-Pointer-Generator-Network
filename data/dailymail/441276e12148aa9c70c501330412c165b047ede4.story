It is the first glimpse of Apple's plan to take on the fitness and health world - and the app that could control the much anticipated iWatch.

Called Healthbook, the new app is expected to be unveiled in June at Apple's annual developer conference.

It offers everything from food and sleep tracking to blood sugar level analysis - and can even tell how much water you've drunk.

At tonight's event, Cook is set to unveil the next-generation of mobile software, dubbed iOS 8.  Although many of the changes are likely to incremental, the biggest addition is rumoured to be an application called Healthbook, which is believed to have leaked last month (pictured) and is designed to track and monitor fitness

According to the blog 9to5mac, which created these mockups, the app is set to be Apple's first move into the fitness tracking industry.

'Multiple sources working directly on the initiative’s development have since provided new details and images of Healthbook that provide a clearer view of Apple’s plans for dramatically transforming the mobile healthcare and fitness-tracking space,' Mark Gurman wrote on the site.

The app shows the scale of Apple's plans.

Healthbook has sections that can track data for bloodwork, heart rate, hydration, blood pressure, physical activity, nutrition, blood sugar, sleep, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and weight.

Apple is said to currently be testing the Healthbook software with iOS 8, the next version of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch operating system.

Expected to be revealed at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June in San Francisco, the app could also work with other health trackers to collect data - although some believe it will work on with Apple's own as yet unannounced health-tracker gadgets.

The app also shows sleep tracking capabilities, although it is unclear how the app will collect the data

Experts believe the much-rumoured iWatch could actually be a fitness band.

T3 magazine mocked up what it expects the gadget to look like.

'Tim Cook has promised us a new product category this year and all the evidence points to a health-related wristband/watch,' said Mark Mayne of T3.

The iBand could be announced as early as June, some believe

'Apple has flagged its interest through a number of recent hires, such as fitness guru Jay Blahnik from Nike, sleep expert Dr. Roy J.E.M. Raymann from Philips Research and former Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts.

'In addition, the tech behind as-yet-underused iBeacon and Touch ID in iOS7 flag the possibility of a full-blown payments tool to take the high street by storm'
