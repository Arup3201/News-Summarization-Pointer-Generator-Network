UKIP voters are disconnected because many cannot send and receive emails, use search engines or browse the internet, Labour’s shadow business secretary has suggested.

Chuka Umunna said that ‘a lot’ of people who voted for the party in its European elections victory were not computer literate and did not have basic online skills.

He promised that a Labour government would be ‘absolutely focused’ on connecting people who have been alienated from the wider economy.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna made the claim to explain why a lot of people supporting UKIP feel disconnected from the modern world.

Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Umunna, 35, said: ‘We’ve got to empower our people.

‘The BBC has carried out some very interesting research on this. One in five people in our economy cannot do the four basics online of sending and receiving an email, browsing the internet, filling in an online form.

‘Now there’s been a lot of talk about communities who’ve been disconnected from our global economy and those of course were a lot of those who were voting for UKIP in the local and European elections.

’And of that mass of people who can’t do the things that all of us take for granted, a very large number of them are from those communities.

‘So the next Labour Government, we are going to be absolutely focused on connecting people into the global economy, so they can realise their dreams and aspirations.’

Last month, the UK Independence Party became the first party other than the Conservatives or Labour to win a national election since 1906 when it surged to victory in the European elections.

The party led by Nigel Farage also picked up more than 100 council seats from Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage has enjoyed success in local and European elections, which his party puts down in part to a strong presence on social media

After the election, Suzanne Evans, who lost her seat as a councillor in Merton, said the party had not replicated its national success in London as voters more ‘media-savvy’.

She said: ‘I don’t think we have got our message across in London. We do have a more media-savvy, well educated population in London and they are more likely to have read some of the negative press that’s been about us.’

Ed Miliband last year announced that former Tomorrow's World presenter Maggie Philbin would lead a Labour-backed taskforce on developing young people's digital skills.

In a speech, the Labour leader warned that the UK is falling behind on IT and said the government is ‘letting down’ businesses and the workforce.

A BBC study published earlier this year found that 19 per cent of adults did not have the basic skills of being able to send and receive emails, use a search engine, browse the internet, and fill out an online application form.

Mr Umunna, who has been compared to Barack Obama, is a rising star in the Labour party and has been tipped as a possible future leader.

Last year, the Streatham MP and former DJ caused anger after it was revealed that he had once criticised nightclubs in London for not being trendy enough.

While working in his old job as a lawyer eight years ago, Mr Umunna had written online: ‘Is it just me or is there a serious lack of cool places to go in central London at the weekends?

‘Most of the West End haunts seem to be full of trash and C-list wannabes, while other places that should know better opt for the cheesy vibe.’
