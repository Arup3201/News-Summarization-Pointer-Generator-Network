Liverpool finally have a fashion faux-pas to rival the infamous cream suits at the 1996 FA Cup final.

Anfield left-back Jose Enrique posted a snap of a host of stars enjoying a night in New York on Brendan Rodgers' side's pre-season tour.

Centre of attention, though, was an eye-catching T-Shirt worn by tricky Brazilian playmaker Philippe Coutinho.

Dress to impress? Philippe Coutinho (third right) wears a questionable top that reads 'Gangsta Frog'

Say cheese: Coutinho was out having fun with his Liverpool team-mates in New York during their USA tour

Bad look: Liverpool players were dubbed as the 'Spice Boys' for their cream suits at the 1996 FA Cup Final

Philippe Coutinho's top he wore during Liverpool's night out in New York, cost a whopping £270.

The 'Gangsta Frog' design is part of German fashion creator Philipp Plein's range.

As well as the amphibian design, T-shirts can be bought sporting Guerrilla Gorilla and Rambo Snake.

The Reds No 10 donned a sparkly shirt bearing the motif 'Gangsta Frog', complete with said rogue amphibian.

But any fans aiming to dress like the Kop idol will have to dig deep.

Despite being a somewhat acquired taste, the shirt, designed by Philipp Plein, will set you back an incredible £270.56.

The delights continue on the back of the shirt, showing off Gangsta Frog's dubious pals Guerrilla Gorilla and Rambo Snake.

Despite his questionable look off-the-field Coutinho has looked the part on it during Liverpool's pre-season to date.

The 22-year-old earning the praise of Rodgers last month when he told the club's official website: 'Coutinho is the brain in our team, the continuity player. He might not score many goals, but he's a wonderful reference for the team.

'He is the one that gets the team 
ticking, gets the movement in front of the ball. He goes and gets on the
 ball. He's a fantastic talent for such a young player and he's still 
gaining his fitness.

'He
 makes the crowd get off their seat. For someone so small, he's very 
tough and robust. He's a wonderful technician that has a great idea, 
tactically, of the game.'

Coutinho,
 who has a further four years left on his present deal with Liverpool, 
will be looking to further stake his claim in Rodgers' first-team plans 
when the Reds face AC Milan in Charlotte on Saturday.
