As their glamorous costumes glistened in the water today, the Olympic synchronised swimmers made their sport look deceptively graceful from the poolside.

But they were using their strength, pinpoint precision and stamina to ensure their movements flowed against the backdrop of the aqua blue water at the Aquatics Centre.

Listening intently to the music played out through underwater speakers, they exercised their tremendous breath control, knowing execution is crucial to their success.

Synchronised swimming is one of two Olympic disciplines contested only by women - the other is rhythmic gymnastics.

After a closely-fought battle Russia's synchronised swimmers swept to gold today with an impeccably executed team routine punctuated by military drumbeats and spectacular acrobatic jumps, marking their fourth consecutive clean sweep at the Games.

China, an emerging force in the sport, pipped Spain to claim silver.

The Russians, who have won every duet and team gold since the Sydney Games, scored 98.93 points out of a possible 100 for their 'free' routine, a sequence which is not prescribed and in which swimmers show off their creative and technical skills.

Today's result was added to their 
top-scoring routine in the team technical round, taking them to a total 
of 197.03 points and an Olympic title.

Russia had already won gold in the synchronised swimming duet segment earlier this week.

China have shown dramatic improvement
under Japanese-born coach Masayo Imura, known as the 'mother of 
synchro' and scored 194.01 points to take the country's first silver in the sport.

Spain, silver medallists in the duet 
segment, were denied second spot by a fractionally lower synchronisation
score than their Chinese rivals, despite an ocean-inspired routine - 
swimmers in fish-scale suits - that had the crowd roaring approval at 
movements imitating crab pincers and ocean waves.

Japan missed out on the podium, 
ending the Games without a synchronised swimming medal for the first 
time since the sport was introduced at the Olympic Games in 1984.

Britain's synchronised swimmers today came in sixth place in their first ever Olympics, meeting the target set by their coach.

The squad performed their Peter Pan-themed free routine today, achieving a combined score of 175.4 including yesterday's technical piece.

Jennifer Knobbs, 23, said she was pleased with how the ground-breaking team had done.

'It was an incredible performance, all our highlights functioned and we really felt as a team underwater. Hearing the crowd cheering, supporting us the whole way, really gives you the boost to perform that much more.'

The eight-strong British team, pinning
their medal hopes on Rio, could not compete with the all-conquering 
Russian team, who won gold today having done the same in Beijing. China 
took silver and Spain bronze.

Katie Skelton, 24, was also upbeat about the final result.

'It was a really strong performance, all our highlights worked and we got a really good score.

'We've shown how strong we are and we've improved so much over the last few years. It stands us in good stead for the future.'

British synchronised swimming was 
given a marked boost in 2007, with lottery funding granted after the 
successful bid for the London Games.

Vicky Lucass, 21, said this was vital to the team, who were able to bring in Canadian coach Biz Price.

She said: 'It's made a huge 
difference. We've been able to bring in Biz Price, get the best coaches 
in the world, bring in their ideas and knowledge. We've centralised as 
well, training eight hours a day together every day and that's played a 
big part.'

The team are now focused on next year's World Championships and beyond that, the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.

Price said: 'We have a couple of 
competitions this year, then it's preparing for the World Championships 
in Barcelona. We just want to keep building up.

'For us the weakest thing is artistic,
that's what we really need to step up on in the future. That's what our
lowest score was here, for the artistic side, so that's what we really 
want to work on.

'It's a really young group, the oldest is 24 and the youngest is 18. So now it's onwards to Rio.'
