The latest entrant in the crowded field of dating apps has perhaps the most unique twist of them all – no faces.

Launched on both Android and Apple devices during the summer, Twine is banking on people wanting to meet others based on similar interests and not solely on looks.  People can eventually choose to reveal pictures when they’re comfortable.

The app has moved away from the tried and true model of picking people to talk to almost solely based on looks, and steers people towards like-minded counterparts.

The app feeds off of information in users’ Facebook profiles, and then creates matches through a combination of GPS proximity and interests in common – without revealing pictures of either side of the match.

Users then chat with each other and are even prompted with conversation topics, if they aren't as chatty as their match. Eventually, pictures can be revealed to their new soul mate.

Billed by developers as an intellectual flirting and dating app, Twine has less than 50,000 downloads in the Google Play store and has not yet cracked the top 50 social/dating apps  in the Apple App Store.

Founder Rohit Singal claimed to the Daily Beast that the app has had over 120,000 downloads and one million matches since its debut.

‘Every other dating app is trying to show you a photo and pick people who are good looking,’ Mr Singal told the Daily Beast, explaining that the idea of pairing people based on similar interests was borne from seeing everyday couples interacting.

Virtually blind: Users' faces are only revealed when they choose

Though apps like Tinder, which have broken dating down to the level of a board game, have been the rage of late, Mr Singal told the Daily Beast he’s trying to do the opposite.

The swipe to like app has ‘become popular because it expedites behavior in real life—we want to connect with attractive people whether the connection’s meaningful or not,’ Mr Singal said.

Aside from not showing faces, Twine also limits the number of matches a user can receive, forcing users to deal in quality, not quantity.

‘We understand this is not common in real life. It would require a change in user behavior to accept what we’re doing,’ he told Daily Beast.

One statistic that might draw more users to the app is the ration of women to men. There are currently 16 females for every male using the app, according to Mr Singal.

Additionally, only a balanced number of women can log in against men at any given time, this is done to level the playing field, the developer explained.

If measured against Tinder - which produces two million matches per day – Twine has quite a ways to go. But Twine isn’t after the Tinder crowd.
