A Conservative Party election agent resigned yesterday after calling female MPs ‘whingeing imbeciles’ and saying feminists ‘need a good slap round the face’.

Stewart Green’s outbursts on Facebook were described as ‘absolutely horrifying’.

In one, he said he was sick of ‘these wretched women MPs who seem to be constantly going on about there not being enough women in frontline politics’.

He added: ‘This country has been a gradual decline southwards towards the dogs ever since we started cow-towing [sic] to the cretinous pseudo-equality demand of these whingeing imbeciles.’

Elsewhere on the social networking site he described an incident on a bus in which his offer to give up his seat was turned down.

He called the woman ‘a fat ginger bitch’ adding: ‘I am absolutely sick and tired of this feminism nonsense.

‘Quite a few of these women need a good slap round the face.’

Mr Green later apologised unreservedly for making the offensive comments saying ‘these statements are not acceptable’.

He
 quit as the agent for Enfield Southgate Conservative Association in 
North London and as parliamentary assistant to David Burrowes MP. 

Mr Burrowes said: ‘His comments were unacceptable and inexcusable.’

A
 Tory Party spokesman added last night: ‘These comments are completely 
inappropriate and it’s right that he has issued an unreserved apology.’
