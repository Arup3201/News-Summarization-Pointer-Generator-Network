Accusations: Paranormal medium Chris Date was giving a ghost tour around a hotel when a man was discovered hiding in the attic after 'ghostly sounds' were heard from the roof

The ghost hunters were gathered in awed silence in the stables of the inn when they heard a clear message from the other side – two knocks on the ceiling.

It sent a shiver around the room, but one seeker of the supernatural still wasn’t satisfied.

He chose to hang around in the hope of a close encounter – and  minutes later got more than he  bargained for when a ‘ghost’ popped out of the attic, very much alive.

Now a row has now broken out between paranormal medium Chris Date who led the £12-a-head ghost hunt and the owner of the hotel who are both accusing each other of pulling the stunt.

Hotel owner Paul Francis said he spotted the man leaving the attic just 20 minutes after the ghost tour and has accused the psychic of foul play.

But Mr Date, 38, who calls himself the Knight Guider, yesterday denied being to blame for the mystery man in the attic at the Halfway Hotel in Llanelli, South Wales, and claimed he has been set up.

The historic hotel has been used as a 
coaching house with stables, a hospital, abattoir and even a prison over
the course of its 225 year history.

There have been numerous sightings of ghosts over the years - including the spirit of a five-year-old boy.

Mr Date brought seven paying guests on the ghost hunt to try and contact the spirit world.

The ghost hunters were led into the stables of the hotel when medium Mr Date asked a spirit to knock twice in answer to a question.

And the guests were hushed as two ghostly knocks were heard from the ceiling above. But just 20 minutes later, hotel staff and members of the public saw a man climb out of an attic near where the knocking sounds had come from.

Halfway Hotel owner Paul Francis said: 'We gave him the keys to the hotel around 4pm in the afternoon to set up and I think he used that time to put someone in the attic.

'During the hunt later that night he was calling out to the ghost world and asked for them to knock as an answer. Well, it sounded like someone knocking on the front door.

'A member of staff 
and a member of the public wanted to see if someone came down from the 
attic where the knocking was coming from.

'Twenty minutes went by and then this guy jumped down. Our staff grabbed the guy and threw him out.

'He [Date] wanted his first evening running a ghost hunt to go with a bang but it backfired in a big way.

'He didn’t get away with what he expected to get away with.'

Ghost hunt guest Mike Grimble, 43, said the attic man claimed he was homeless and had nothing to do with the spooky sounds.

But sceptic Mr Grimble claims the 'homeless man' was wearing 'designer jeans'.

He claimed psychic medium Mr Date drove away from the hotel shortly after the man was caught climbing down from the attic.

Mr Grimble said: 'In life the only certainty, other than being born, is death.

'Billions of people have a religion and they are all looking for the same thing - that there’s something else after death.

'People who are looking for answers could be vulnerable.'

Professional medium Mr Date denied allegations he planted a man in the attic to pretend to be a ghost.

He said: 'It was nothing to do with me, I believe the whole thing was orchestrated to try and set me up, which is one of the reasons why I left.

'The knocking did not sound like what I am used to. I said on several occasions that it was odd, the noise was too extreme.

'I take what I am doing very seriously. I believe in what I do so I would never do anything like this.

'I have got a very good track record. It’s disgusting, I would never do that.'

On Mr Date’s website he is described as 'a great intuitive reader who speaks from the heart'.

It tells potential customers: 'If you are lost and need to find your way again or if you need reassurance then a reading from Knight Guider is for you.

'A male medium with a strong spiritual guide who comes forward to help enable connections with those who have passed over.'
