The Ministry of Defence is looking to cash in on this 19th Century French chateau-style mansion by putting it on the market for £5 million.

Minley Manor is a stunning-looking Grade II listed property with historic parks and gardens.

It was built in the 1850s by British architect Henry Clutton for Raikes Currie, a wealthy London Banker and MP.

Minley Manor is being sold by the Ministry of Defence for an estimated £5 million. The French chateau style mansion was built by a wealthy MP during the 1850s

The stunning property features its own 600 metre long wooded avenue as well as an Orangery

It took 14 years to complete the construction of the magnificent mansion

Raikes Currie was born in 1801 into a wealthy family.

Educated at Eton, he became a partner in his father's bank in 1826.

Following his father's death in 1843, he took over control of the bank

Although between 1837 and 1857 he was a Liberal MP for Northhampton.

In 1846, he bought Minley Manor near Farborough and employed Henry Clutton to design it.

The house was completed in 1860, nine years before the death of his wife Laura.

Raikes Currie died at home in Minley Manor in October 1881.

He then commissioned Robert Veitch to lay out the gardens of the mansion, which is regarded as one of Surrey’s most remarkable properties.

Further extensions including the Stable Block and Orangery were made by the architect George Devey between 1884 and 1886.

There is also a beautiful, 600-metre long avenue of Wellingtonia trees which sit to the north of the manor home.

The complete estate, which then stood at around 2,500 acres, was later sold to the War Department in 1934.

In 1971, it was taken over by the Royal Engineers who are now based at Gibraltar Barracks on the other side of the A327 Minley Road.

Minley Manor, with its outbuildings, boasts a total of more than 88,000 sq/ft of potential accommodation - the equivalent of 90 new homes.

It was last used in August 2013 and has featured in a number of films, most recently the 2007 fantasy Stardust with Robert de Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer.

The manor is now being sold by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation as part of the government’s estate ‘rationalisation programme’.

It has been put on the market with Carter Jonas with an asking price of in excess of £5 million.

Emma Jewson, associate partner at Carter Jonas, said: 'It is a unique building. The external design is very special and as it has been owned by the government it has been well maintained.'

The stunning mansion is set on 2,500 acres of land and features an Orangery as well as dozens of outbuildings and walled gardens
