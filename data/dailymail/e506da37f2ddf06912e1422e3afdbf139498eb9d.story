A 20-year-old welding student from Philadelphia was killed on Monday afternoon when a train struck him as he walked along the tracks while texting.

Andre Washington, who was hit at about 4.30pm, never looked round at the train that was coming up behind him while sounding its horn.

The conductor of the SEPTA train tried to hit the brakes and alert Mr Washington, but he was unable to stop in time.

Hit: Andre Washington, 20, was struck and killed by a train on Monday afternoon

Mr Washington, who was due to graduate from the Eastern Center for Arts and Technology later this year, was on the way to see a friend when he was struck by the commuter train, which was carrying about 500 passengers.

He died at the scene, near Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's Noble station in Jenkintown.

In his statement to police, the 
conductor, who has not been named, said Mr Washington had his back to 
the train as it came round a bend in the tracks.

'The victim never once flinched,
 turned around, looked at [the conductor] or indicated that he knew the train was 
coming,' Deputy Chief John Livingwood told 6ABC.

Despite applying the brakes and sounding the horn, the conductor was unable to get the attention of the victim.

'It doesn't make sense: He would've heard, he should've heard,' Andre Washington Sr, who shares the same name as his son, said.

'We're still grieving. The whole thing is just too much to think about.'

The victim's grandmother, Beverly Washington, said she couldn't understand why Mr Washington chose to walk on the tracks.

'My thoughts are all up in the air. 
When they told me what had happened, I could barely understand them, 
through my crying,' she told Philly.com.

She paid tribute to her grandson, who 'cared about everybody and would do anything to help'.

In a tragic twist of fate, the day after Mr Washington's death, a nationwide campaign to raise awareness of track dangers was promoted by SEPTA.

The See Tracks? Think Train! campaign, by national group Operation Lifesaver, was launched on April 8 to help reduce the number of injuries around railway tracks.

SEPTA spokeswoman Heather Redfern told Mail Online: 'The launch of the program had been previously scheduled for April 8, the timing with the incident at Noble Station is an unfortunate coincidence.'

She added that a full investigation into Mr Washington's death is underway.Â
