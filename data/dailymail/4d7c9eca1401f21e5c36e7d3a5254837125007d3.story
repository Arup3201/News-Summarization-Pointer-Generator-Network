The grieving family of murdered hostage Alan Henning joined hundreds of mourners, including leaders of the Muslim community, at a service of reflection last night.

The taxi driver’s wife Barbara, and two children Lucy, 17, and Adam, 15, were embraced in emotional scenes at St Mary’s Church in Eccles, Manchester. 

The Rev Cyprian Yobera asked the congregation to have understanding even when ‘our world seems to be infested by those who do not value life’.

Numb: Barbara Henning and her family hear tributes to Alan Henning at a service at St Mary's Church, Eccles

He added: ‘It is difficult at a time like this when we have to deal with tragedy that we cannot understand. Everybody feels like they knew him, even those of us who never met him.’

The streets of Eccles were transformed into a sea of yellow. Ribbons adorned with the words ‘Alan, our hero’ were fixed to every lamppost, bench and tree. 

A cross in the town centre became a shrine for the laying of flowers in tribute to the kidnapped aid worker.

Mrs Henning, 45, said that news of the killing had left the family ‘numb with grief’.

She praised her 47-year-old husband as a ‘decent, caring human being’ whose ‘interest was in the welfare of others’.

The Bishop of Manchester, the Rt Rev Dr David Walker, described Mr Henning as a martyr who had paid ‘the ultimate sacrifice’ for his good deeds.

Much-loved: The father-of-two, pictured, was a well-known figure in the town due to his tireless charity work

He joined the mass outpouring of grief for the father-of-two who was beheaded by IS militants on Friday.

Bishop Walker said: ‘The Christian faith is centred around a man who did good, enormous good, and who actually paid with his life for it.

‘Alan stands in that fine tradition. Since the time of Jesus Christ, we have a word ‘martyrdom’ in the Christian faith for it, those who do good and end up paying the ultimate sacrifice for it.’ 

Mr Henning, 47, who was kidnapped by the Islamic State on an aid trip to Syria last December, was a well-known figure in the town due to his tireless charity work and lengthy career driving taxis. 

Reflection: A book of condolence in memory of Alan Henning is displayed in Eccles Parish Church on Sunday

One message attached to Eccles Cross in the town centre read: ‘Whilst we come to terms with this living nightmare, your suffering is over. You leave an irreplaceable gap in all our lives.'

‘A special man with a heart of gold,’ read another.  

Friends of the father of two – known affectionately as Gadget due to his love of technology - stood on the Greater Manchester town’s quiet streets yesterday sharing stories about him. 

Anthony Flannery condemned the ‘appalling’ killing and expressed his disappointment that the Government had not done more to free the hostage.

Outpouring: One of the tributes placed at the base of the Eccles Cross reads 'We never knew you Alan but you have touched everyone with your selflessness'. Dozens of bouquets were laid alongside it

The retired 64-year-old said: ‘It’s harder to take because he was really doing some good.

‘We really had a little light of hope that he might be coming back, especially when we heard Cameron making a speech about how we don’t give in to terrorists.

Mr Flannery added: ‘It’s hard to describe how I feel. It’s like losing a part of yourself.’

He recounted talking to Mr Henning about a previous aid mission to Syria in which he had been shot at but insisted on his desire to go back.

Public tribute: Yellow ribbons with the words 'Alan our hero' were tied around Eccles town centre on Sunday

‘He knew the dangers and he went forward because he was all about helping people. He had a good heart.'

Barbara Keeley, MP for Worsley and Eccles South, said that people were still ‘stunned’ by the death and struggled to accept the actions of his killers.

She said: ‘They can’t square the fact that he was such a decent person on an aid mission with the savage and barbaric way in which he was killed. How could they do that?’  

Muslim groups have responded unanimously to denounce the killings, describing Mr Henning as a ‘British hero’.

Memories: One of the floral tributes contained a note that said 'thoughts are with your family'

Manchester Central Mosque Iman Asim Hussain yesterday criticised IS, calling them ‘misguided individuals’.

A visibly emotional Shameela Islam-Fulfigar, a doctor at Tameside Hospital who was part of the last convoy on which Mr Henning travelled, said: ‘The world lost an honourable and remarkable hero.’

Yesterday she set up an online memorial fund, in consultation with Mrs Henning, aiming to raise £20,000.

Dr Islam-Fulfigar said she wanted to show the taxi driver’s children that ‘their father’s death was not in vain and that the work that Alan was so committed to will also continue’.
