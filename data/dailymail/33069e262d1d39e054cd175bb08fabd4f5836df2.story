Romance was the order of the day at Donna Karan this afternoon, as the designer sent out a collection of evening gowns in light-as-air silks

A complete contrast from the DKNY collection yesterday, the designer's mainline collection was pure understated luxury that promises to be as easy to wear as it is on the eye.

The dresses ranged in hue from soft caramel to rose pink and aquamarine to lavender, as if borrowed from a watercolour artist's palette.

Though each look was monochrome, Mrs Karan added drama with texture. One bubble hem number was topped by a co-ordinating ostrich feather shrug, another was an intricate network of embellished cut-outs.

A showstopper, though was a chiffon evening gown that shimmered with delicate beading.

Supermodel Lindsey Wixson was among the girls on the catwalk - it is likely to have been a mad dash for the teenager who also walked Carolina Herrera this morning.

Ashley Greene, the face of the label's campaigns, was in the front row, along with Australian actress Rachael Taylor.

Anna Wintour was present, of course, seated alongside Grace Coddington, with Kimora Lee Simmons and Bianca Jagger rounding out the VIP guests.

3.1 PHILLIP LIM

A favourite among New York's coolest girls, 3.1 Phillip Lim paid tribute to his target customer with a streetwear-inspired collection that was heavy on pale denim and graphic prints.

The silky shifts and elegant tailoring that the designer has become known for were certainly present, but the latest line had a deconstructed feel with a mash-up of unexpected layers and prints.

Speaking after the show, the designer explained: 'It's about taking what you have in front of you, cutting it up, not throwing anything away and mixing it up again...

But I don't want it to come off as your homeless, so we disguised it 
and veiled it with sheerness, so there's an illusion to the sensuality.'

Press have so far been raving about the collection - particularly the pink suede overalls.

Fashion blogger and America's Next Top Model judge Bryanboy said: 'Phillip Lim was youthful. Lots of florals! Love many of the flat strappy booties, suede overalls, trousers and jackets.'

Lauren Stevenson, PR Director at My-wardrobe.com, called it 'Effortless cool', adding: 'Phillip Lim's 
collection was an explosion of prints, fabrics and colour, with an 
underlying message of cool in every look.

'I love the "Neuvo" York tees, 
dungarees, oversized biker jackets and metallic oversized bags and 
shoes. Amazing collection!'

BELSTAFF

Belstaff, the label behind Jennifer Lawrence's Hunger Games boots, also showed today, delivering a leather-heavy collection that was pure Katniss chic.

While the footwear was more strappy stilettos than hunting flats, the belted biker jacket, worn with matching leather skirt, seemed to take its lead from the hit movie trilogy.

Though there were easy shirtdresses, slinky silk trousers and stiff A-line skirts, leather was unarguably the star here. From belts to tanks it filtered into every look.

U.S. Elle remarked that the label had successfully translated its heavy moto-girl aesthetic for spring.

'Feat accomplished [with] white, taupe, and wide leather belts,' it tweeted.
