Standup comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about Bill Cosby, calling him a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a performance last week.

'Bill Cosby has the f***ing smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,' Buress declared from the stage Thursday night at the Trocadero Theater in Cosby's hometown of Philadelphia.

Mocking America’s beloved dad from The Cosby Show, Buress said: '"Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the '80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom." Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches.'

In his own words: Buress, 31, alluded to the controversy his performance had sparked on Twitter

'I don't curse on stage. But yeah, you're a rapist,' Philadelphia Magazine reported. 

The 77-year-old Emmy - and Grammy-winning actor and comedian, who has been married for 50 years and has five children, has been battling accusations of sex assault for more than three decades.

According to published reports, between the 1970s and early 2000s, as many as 13 women have come forward accusing Cosby of sexual assault.

In 2006, the legendary comic, actor and activist reached a settlement with a woman who claimed that Cosby drugged and assaulted her at his home in a Philadelphia suburb, reported The Wrap.

Cosby, however, has never been publicly accused of, or charged with, rape.

Buress, 31, delivered his excoriating critique of Dr Cosby during the Philadelphia leg of his multi-city Comedy Camisado Tour.

'I want to just at least make it weird for you to watch Cosby Show reruns,' Buress said to the audience Thursday night. 'If you don't know about it, trust me. When you leave here, Google "Bill Cosby rape." That s*** has more results than Hannibal Buress.'

America's favorite dad: Cosby, center, is best known for portraying Dr Heathcliff Huxtable, the patriarch of a middle-class New York family, on the long-running sitcom The Cosby Show

Cosby, best known for portraying the sweater-wearing, wise-cracking Dr Heathcliff Huxtable on the long-running Cosby Show, has become a polarizing figure in recent years for urging young black men to change their way of dress in order to be more successful in life.

Cosby also has been critical of some of his fellow comedians, most famously Eddie Murphy, for using foul language in their routines.  

Hannibal Buress, a regular on Comedy Central’s Broad Street, appeared last year in the R-rated comedy Neighbors starring Zac Ephron and Seth Rogen. Earlier this month, he was cast as a voice actor in the upcoming animated feature Angry Birds based on the popular game.

In August, it was revealed by Deadline that Bill Cosby was on the verge of signing a deal with NBC to develop a new family comedy starring the 77-year-old actor in a familiar role of a patriarch of a multi-generational clan.

Not mincing words: Buress, a former SNL writer, described Cosby as a hypocrite for urging young black men to 'pull up their pants' and for criticizing fellow comedians for using foul language on stage  

If all goes according to plan, the show will premiere sometime in the summer or fall of 2015.

As of Tuesday evening, Dr Cosby has not responded to Hannibal Buress' rant accusing him of being a rapist.

Buress, on his part, alluded to the controversy he had sparked on Twitter this morning, writing to his nearly 300,000 fans: 'Boy, that escalated quickly. I mean that really got out of hand fast.'
