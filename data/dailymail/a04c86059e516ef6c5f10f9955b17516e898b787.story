When the hugs and high-fives with Chelsea’s players gave way to some solemn handshakes with his former Arsenal team-mates, Cesc Fabregas made his way towards the East Stand.

It was there, just before he made his way into the lip of the tunnel, that the Chelsea midfielder looked up and blew kisses to the supporters celebrating inside Stamford Bridge. He is blue through and through now.

Fabregas rose to the occasion, disciplining himself in the centre of Chelsea’s midfield and engineering their sixth win in the Barclays Premier League.

He set up Diego Costa’s goal in the 78th minute with the sweetest of lob wedges over Arsenal’s back-pedalling defence, rushing over to celebrate with the forward after he chested down and finished on the run.

Fabregas is making this team tick, driving them on when he has Nemanja Matic, John Terry and Gary Cahill providing defensive security behind him.

His seventh assist of a season that could finish with him crowned PFA player of the year was a beauty.

To his credit he ignored the chants of Arsenal’s supporters in a corner of the Shed when he casually walked over to take a corner at the start of the second half.

They were at their most provocative, with many pointing at him and chanting obscenities as he went to retrieve the ball behind the byline. Fabregas didn’t even look up.

At least some applauded, remembering his contribution during eight years at Arsenal during which he never won anything more than the FA Cup in 2005 and the 2004 Community Shield.

There is no malice. ‘I have huge respect for Arsenal, they gave me everything when I was little,’ he admitted after he was named man of the match.

‘Without Arsenal I would not have won the things I have won and I understand the fans’ reaction. I know the fans love me. I’m not scared, they will be in my heart for ever. But now I’m at this fantastic club, playing with great players, with a great coach and great fans.’

Fabregas knew which way the wind was blowing when he returned to English football in the summer after three years with his boyhood team Barcelona.

One meeting is all it took, a conversation with Jose Mourinho that convinced him the future was blue. He has made the right call. ‘To be fair, he didn’t give this performance because he had a special motivation against Arsenal,’ said Mourinho.

‘He’s been doing this from day one. He’s unbelievable. He showed he is very special and showed the professional he is.

‘To play against the team where he was made for football shows his commitment to us even more, as well as his professionalism.’

Fabregas looks at home here, settling into a rhythm and providing some creativity from midfield.

There is a different feel to Chelsea. In the past they relied on Frank Lampard’s late runs into the area. Now it is all about the partnership between Fabregas and Costa.

There were times when Fabregas could easily have reacted here, particularly when Danny Welbeck took him out in the final minutes.

Although he winced and went down, he appeared to accept that this was the price to pay for turning his back. When he wakes up on Monday with some stiffness in his legs after a bruising encounter, he will know he made the right decision.
