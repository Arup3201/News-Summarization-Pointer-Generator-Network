An artistic dad from Maryland has come up with a way to inspire his son each day during his lunchtime break at school by drawing a different cartoon character on Post-It Note alongside some words of wisdom.

Brent Almond, a graphic designer who also runs a blog called Designer Daddy, packs his son Jon's lunchbox full of an endearingly-designed note each and every day - along with his sandwiches and snacks.

The doting father has been posting his efforts on his Instagram account, which is titled @SuperLunchNotes and his artistic endeavors have quickly garnered  thousands of devoted followers.

It's got crunch! Brent Almond sends his son Jon to school with a hand-drawn Post-It note in his lunchbox every day

My hero: Every school morning for the past year and a half, the Maryland blogger and graphic designer has created a special cartoon for the five-year-old

Brent's creations, although detailed, require nothing more than a Sharpie and a Post-It - and an inspiring message.

The characters range from the Hulk, Thor and Darth Vader to Princess Elsa, The Count and even Super Mario, all of whom Brent has relied upon to help him to deliver his humorous and meaningful messages.

'My son, Jon, started preschool last year and for the first day of school I drew a Batman on a Post-It Note and wrote "Go get 'em, Jon",' Brent told ABC News. 

'And then I kept putting in notes for the first week. He really liked it and I had a lot of fun with it, so I just kept doing it after that.'  

He added to Today.com: 'It was a big day for us to send him off to school for the first time. I wanted to be there with him.

No whining! Brent uses his artistic skills to inspire his son with a series of meaningful messages 

Flipping out: His drawings are now becoming famous worldwide after he started posting them to Instagram

'I say it was to give him comfort but it was just as much for me, as anything, just to know I was with him in a way.

'We watch a lot of cartoons and movies together. There are so many different ways to introduce kids to characters, but one of my rules is that I never use one that he isn't already familiar with.'

Brent also tries to keep up-to-date with new characters and does his own research to ensure he will be in the know when it comes to poplar culture and what characters his son might like to see.

He insists that Power Ranger and Transformers are the hardest to draw.

Brent had initially intended to stick with superheroes but as Jon became interested in other cartoons he decided to broaden his repertoire and began to include Ninja Turtles, Transformers, Godzilla, Star Wars figures and Disney characters into the mix.

Each drawing takes about half an hour to complete.

Brent likes to keep the drawings topical and often marks milestones, including birthdays and holidays, which a special artistic creation. 

He will also adjust the characters depending on the time of year.

'A lot of it is just what he's watching on TV or what he's playing on the iPad. He's really into Power Rangers right now because he takes taekwondo, so he loves anything martial arts-related,' he said.

When he is not drawing on Post-it notes for his adopted son, Brent, who also lives with his husband, is a full-time graphic designer.

'I've been working for myself since 2002, and it's been pretty successful,' he said. 'Then, when we started a family, my husband is an attorney, so it was a lot easier for me to be flexible and handle all of the childcare.'

Brent says he knows Jon loves to receive the notes and revealed that the youngster often shares them with teachers and classmates at school. 

But despite the attention his creative notes are receiving, he says he never loses sight of who they are for.

Spreading his wings: Brent grew up drawing different superheroes and is incredibly excited to be able to share his passion with his son

Freeze! Brent says intends to keep up the lunch notes until his son asks him to stop. But so far, it seems to be keeping them both entertained
