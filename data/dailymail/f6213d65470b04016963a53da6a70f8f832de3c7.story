Eleven suspected illegal immigrants have been arrested after they were seen clinging to a moving lorry.

The group, believed to be from Syria, were arrested on the M20 motorway near Folkestone, Kent, on suspicion of illegal entry into Britain after they were seen riding on top of the vehicle by a fellow driver. 

Police were called at 7.15am to reports that a group of men had been jumping down from a tanker or lorry at the slip road to junction 11.

'Eleven men, all claiming to be Syrian, were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences and have been taken into immigration detention while their cases are dealt with.'

Just one week ago, 17 illegal immigrants were caught on the M25 motorway in Surrey.

Fourteen people were seen fleeing from the back of a lorry after it stopped at Cobham Services. 

They were caught by police and taken into custody.

Then three others were arrested nearby at Cobham and Stoke d'Abernon station after reports of people on the tracks.

All 17 were believed to be from Sudan and Eritrea.
