A wide-spread rumor that retired baseball all-star Kevin Mitchell decapitated his girlfriend's cat has been further substantiated after ex-Mets teammate Darryl Strawberry confirmed the incident.Â 

The baseball urban legend goes back to1999, when Strawberry and Mitchell's fellow teammate Dwight 'Doc' Gooden detailed the horrifying incident in his autobiography 'Heat'.

While Mitchell has denied the story for years, in an interview with Huffington Post Live on Tuesday, Strawberry said it was all true.

Did he do it? Former Mets player Kevin Mitchell decapitated his girlfriend's cat, according to urban legend. That rumor received more backing this week when ex-teammate Darryl Strawberry confirmed the story. Mitchell pictured in  1986 above

'That's a pretty good story. I think that's pretty accurate Kevin Mitchell did do that,' he said.

'Kevin Mitchell, he's a different type of guy. Great guy, super teammate...I guess he figured that the girlfriend was acting a little crazy, so I'll kill her cat.'

Strawberry appeared on HuffPo Live with his wife Tracy as they promote their new book 'The Imperfect Marriage: Help For Those Who Think It's Over'

Strawberry was close with both Mitchell and Gooden during their time on the Mets, and all three were part of the 1986 World Series-winning team.

According to Gooden's description in Heat, the cat incident happened sometime in the mid-80s when he showed up at Mitchell's house with a friend unannounced.

He says the two accidentally interrupted a fight Mitchell and his live-in girlfriend were having, and were ordered not to leave the house as the couple bickered.

'When we got there, I realized Kevin was both drunk and angry, a dangerous combination. He was holding a twelve-inch knife in his hands, having an argument with his live-in girlfriend. Kevin was right in the girl's face, screaming at the top of his lungs,' Gooden recalls in the book.

Gooden says both he and Mitchell's girlfriend tried to clam him down but he couldn't be persuaded.

'Mitch turned to her and raised his anger to yet another level. Still holding the knife in his right hand, he grabbed his girlfriend's little cat, who had the misfortune to be walking near his feet at that very moment.

'In one awful sweep of his hand, Mitch pulled the cat's head back, exposing its throat.

'"You think I'm kidding when I say don't ever fuck with me?" he shouted. Before the girl could answer, Mitch took the knife to the cat, and cut its head off. Clean.'

In 2002, Mitchell spoke about the incident with author Jeff Pearlman, who was writing a book about the 1986 Mets team.

'How could I cut off a cat's head with a kitchen knife? Hell, I love animals,' Mitchell stated.
