'Ghost' patients on the NHS cost the taxpayer a staggering £150m a year it has been revelaed.

The scandalous statistics reveal the number of people signed up with GP's exceeds the population by more than 2million people, costing £450m over the last three years.

It means hundreds of family doctors around the country could be boosting their income by keeping patients who have died or moved away on their treatment list.

Crisis: The number of patients registered on the NHS database exceeds the population by more than 2million costing the taxpayer £450m (stock picture)

The figures present a national 'crisis' while patients are struggling to get a doctors appointment, according to campaigners. 

The NHS have to cover the costs of these 
phantom patients because doctors are given £66.25 for each person registered to their practice.

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This is a scandalous waste of taxpayers’ money and further proof, if more was needed, that the heath budget is not being spent wisely.

'Given the amount of cash that has been thrown at NHS record system in recent years it’s absurd that so many ghost patients exist.

'Those who have cynically exploited this leak, along with officials who have allowed this problem to go unchecked, must be held to account for their actions.'

Resigned: In 2011 Doctors Javanti and Arun Singh denied that more than 1,000 patients registered at their clinic were either dead or had moved overseas

The
Chief Executive of the Patients Association, Katherine Murphy said: 
'The NHS has been dogged by costly IT failures, PFI (private finance 
initiative) projects and failures to manage its finances properly.

'It is facing an unprecedented funding squeeze, with billions of pounds to find in a budget which may in itself have a black hole of up to £30bn.'

Last year 55,724,785 patients were listed with GPs, but only 53,493,729 people were said to be living in this country, costing £148m.

The system takes time for the systems to update when someone has died. so areas with a high number of elderly 
patients such as Cornwall and Blackpool, Lancashire, are heavily affected.

University cities also feature high up the list because students tend to register with a doctor for three to four years before moving away. 

Berkshire had the highest number of 
phantom patients with 138% of the population being registered to 
practices, according to an investigation by The Sunday Times.

Cambridge and Hertsmere in Hertfordshire follow closely behind with 126%.

The scandal comes two years after four doctors were suspended when 3,00 patients on their list were found to be non-existent or had false information about them.

In addition, some patients at the practice, in South London, were recorded as suffering from dementia or obesity, or stated they were given drugs they had not taken, according to the General Medical Council.

A report by the Audit Commission in 
2004 warned that the NHS could be wasting £100million a year paying 
surgeries for patients who don’t exist.

While many are kept on lists accidentally, officials at the watchdog warned that some GPs ‘conveniently forget’ to remove them.

In the wake of the 2004 report, the 
Department of Health ordered family doctors to ‘cleanse their lists and 
remove ghost patients but many have failed to do so.

In 2009 Birmingham GP Mohammad Cheema
was found to have more than 30 ghost patients, earning him an 
additional income of about £2,500 a year.

In one case a family said they had been receiving letters from a surgery addressed to another person for 20 years.

Dr David Geddes, NHS England’s head of primary care, said: 'In the majority of cases, GP practices work hard to keep their registered patient lists as accurate as they can and our area teams are working closely with them to achieve this.

'One of the main issues they face is that patients often fail to notify practices when leaving the area or country and this can mean that so-called ‘ghost’ patients remain registered.

It is really important that patients keep their GPs informed if they are changing practices or leaving the area so that their registration can be amended.

'There can also sometimes be a short time lapse between updating national practice systems when a patient registers with another surgery, which can result in duplication. All efforts are made to ensure this is resolved as soon as possible.'
