A Fijian man has been arrested over the death of an Australian woman whose body was found on the side of a road in Fiji this week.

The badly beaten and decomposed body of Tracey Ann O'Brien Maw was found in bushes by a passing farmer on Tuesday evening near the village of Vunavutu on Fiji's Vita Levu Island.

Police spokeswoman Ana Naisoro confirmed on Friday that a local man has been taken into custody in relation to Maw's death.  

'At this moment we cannot reveal the identity of the person because we have not charged him yet. But I can say that we have a strong lead,' Ms Naisoro told the Australian Federal Police. 

Ms Maw, from Shepparton in Victoria's north-east, had been bashed to death in an 'alleged murder' according to Nine News.

Tracey Ann O'Brien Maw, from Shepparton in Victoria's north-east, was found dead on Tuesday 

A police spokesperson from Sigatoka in the south-west of Fiji's Vita Levu Island, where Ms Maw was found, told Daily Mail Australia that she had to be identified by her tattoos after the severe bashing.

'She was formally identified by the brother, and some of the tattoo marks that were on her leg, as the woman who was missing,' the spokesman said.

Nine News reported that her brother, Rodney Maw, had travelled to Fiji to look for his sister who is understood to have been missing for some time.

The spokesperson said that she was found in the area 'where she was staying with her boyfriend', a local Fijian man.

Ms Maw is believed to have been in the country in an attempt to re-establish a relationship with the man.

Police Commissioner Ben Groenewald said Maw had gone to Vunavutu village with a friend.

Her body has already been cremated 'due to the extreme stage of putrefaction of the victim's body,' BJJ Groenewald said.

Her body, which had been brutally bashed, was found in some bushes by a passing Fijian farmer

However some of Ms Maw's relatives are concerned the speed of the cremation will have failed to allow a precise investigation into how she was killed.

Her brother is believed to have returned to Australia today.

Officials from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are providing consular assistance to her family.
