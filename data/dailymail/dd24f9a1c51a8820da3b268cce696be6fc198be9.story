A woman and her pet dog were killed in an alleged hit-and-run while they were out for an evening walk.

Kathleen Heslop, 64, and her miniature schnauzer Trudy died in the crash as she crossed the road near her home in Prudhoe, Northumberland, last night.

She was pronounced dead at the scene after the collision, which happened at around 10.25pm on the B6395 Stonyflat Bank.

Killed: Kathleen Heslop and her dog Trudy both died in a suspected hit-and-run crash in Prudhoe, Northumberland

The motorist drove off in a 'dark coloured' Saab after the incident, but was caught following a police appeal for information.

A 26-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and remains in custody, Northumbria Police said.

A second arrest was later made in connection with the incident, a police spokesman said. A 28-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

Superintendent Jim Napier said: 'We believe that the woman was crossing 
the road near to the old Prudhoe hospital when she was hit by the 
vehicle. The driver then left the scene without reporting the collision.'

Police have conducted a fingertip search of the scene, which is just a few minutes' walk from Ms Heslop's three-bedroomed semi-detached home.

Resident: Ms Heslop, who lived in Prudhoe, is understood to have worked at the local Co-Op store

Floral tributes to Ms Heslop, who was understood to have worked in the Co-Operative store in the town, were left at the crash site today.

One bouquet of yellow roses contained a message which read: 'Kathleen, I always called you my Auntie. My love always. R.I.P. Sheila and David XXX.'

Anyone who witnessed the crash or who 
was travelling on the B6395 on Saturday evening is asked to contact Northumbria Police.
