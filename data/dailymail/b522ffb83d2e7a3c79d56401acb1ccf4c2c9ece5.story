More than 200 letters written by mass murderer Anders Breivik have been seized to stop him setting up a far-right  organisation from within his prison cell.

Prison authorities have revealed they seized 220 of his letters because the correspondence showed he was attempting to establish himself as the 'frontman' of an organization prepared to use extreme violence.

Breivik was responsible for the massacre of 77 people in 2011 after detonating a bomb in downtown Oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on Utoya Island.

A written ruling stated: 'Breivik's intention is to consolidate his position as front man and leader figure for a movement that involves using extreme violence and terror as an instrument,' The Local reported.

Yling Faeste, a spokesman for Norway's prison system, added: 'We have refused to send some letters from Breivik for reasons of security. We're talking about roughly 220 letters.'

The right-wing, anti-muslim extremist was sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment with preventive detention in 2012.

It the harshest possible prison sentence available under the Norwegian justice system and it is likely he will remain in prison for the rest of his life.

Since his incarceration, Breivik has made increasingly desperate attempts to receive publicity, as well as issuing a number of bizarre demands.

In February, he threatened to go on hunger strike unless prison authorities cave in to a list of demands for better conditions - including giving him a PlayStation 3.

It emerged that he had issued a typed list of 12 demands to authorities at the high-security unit in Skien in southeast Norway where he is serving out his sentence.

The demands - outlined in a letter sent to the the French national newsagency AFP  - included better conditions for his daily walk and the right to communicate more freely with the outside world, which he argues are in line with European rights legislation.

He also demanded that his PlayStation 2 games console be upgraded to a Playstation 3 'with access to more adult games that I get to choose myself'.

Held apart from other prisoners since 2011 for security reasons, Breivik argued in the letter sent in November, last year, that he has the right to a wider 'selection of activities' than other inmates to compensate for his strict isolation.
