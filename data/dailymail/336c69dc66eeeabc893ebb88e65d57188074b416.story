Arsenal are waiting to hear what punishment could be coming Jack Wilshere's way after the midfielder aimed an abusive hand gesture towards Manchester City supporters during Saturday's 6-3 loss at the Etihad Stadium.

The Football Association will review the full match report of referee Martin Atkinson before deciding whether to launch a disciplinary case against Wilshere after television cameras showed him raising his middle finger in the direction of home fans.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says the club will accept any punishment the FA hands down.

Controversial: Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere appeared to make an offensive gesture at The Etihad

Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was 
suspended for one match, fined Â£20,000 and warned as to his future 
conduct after he made the same gesture to home fans as he walked off the
pitch following a 1-0 defeat at Fulham in December 2011.

A possible ban for Wilshere could be 
compounded by bad news on the injury front, with Arsenal awaiting an 
update on Laurent Koscielny after the defender suffered a deep cut 
attempting to prevent Alvaro Negredo scoring City's second goal.

The heavy defeat at City saw the 
Gunners' lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League cut to two 
points, with the visit of second-placed Chelsea next up on December 23.

Wenger believes his side's response to the bitter disappointment of Saturday's humiliation could define their season.

'It is how we respond in the next game, that is what makes a season. It can happen,' Wenger said.

'You could see we played on Wednesday away from home and we were not as fresh as we can be, but it is how we respond now.

'There are always positives in a game and there were a lot of them, but still we have to come back to reality.

'It is about us defending together in games like that and we did not do that.'

Meanwhile, midfielder Mesut Ozil has apologise for failing to applaud the visiting fans at full-time of Saturday's match.

'Sorry I didn't thank the fans at the end of the game!' Arsenal's record signing said on his Facebook page.

'You have been brilliant to me and I know you had travelled a long way and spent your money to support us.

'I was upset with the result and know I
should have come to you to say 'thank you' and I know it is a big 
Arsenal tradition win, lose or draw.'
