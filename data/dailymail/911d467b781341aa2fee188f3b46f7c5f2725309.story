An incredible dash-cam video has captured the heart-stopping moment a Kansas City police officer stopped a suicidal man from throwing himself 60 feet off an interstate overpass by grabbing his leg.

Sergeant Steven Griswold said what started out as a stranded motorist call turned into a suicide rescue mission early Saturday morning on a ramp from Interstate 49 to Interstate 470 in the Three Trails Crossing.

The 15-second video released this week by Kansas City police shows Griswold's heroics.

Hero: An incredible dash-cam video has captured the heart-stopping moment Kansas City police officer Steven Griswold, pictured, stopped a suicidal man from throwing himself 60 feet off an interstate overpass

En route to the location, the 12-year police veteran, who'd received Crisis Intervention Team training, received a second call - this one from a woman who had also spoken to the motorist and said he told her he wanted to kill himself.

Griswold is seen on the tape pulling up his patrol car behind the man's vehicle.

But the driver was already perched on the ramp beside a concrete barrier, a 60-foot drop to the interstate below him.

'I got about 10 feet away,' Griswold said, according to the Kansas City Star.

Then the man began to lean over the barrier. Griswold had to act fast.

'He threw the top half of his body over the concrete barrier,' Griswold said. 'I grabbed his ankles before he flipped over.'

Griswold pulled him back onto the pavement and to safety.

The driver did not speak, but Griswold said he sensed the man's relief at being rescued. The man was then taken to receive treatment.

Griswold told the newspaper he had never had a call quite like this in all his years with the city's police force.

However, he deflected any praise, disputed his new found hero label.

'I feel kind of silly getting any attention over this,' he said. 'You don't have time to talk, you just react. And then I was on to the next call.'
