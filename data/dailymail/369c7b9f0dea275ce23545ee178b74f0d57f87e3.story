The designer behind American Apparel's menstruation T-shirt, branded 'vile' and 'distributing', has had her Instagram account deleted after uploading an image of her unshaven bikini line.

Toronto-based Petra Collins, 20, posted a snap of herself from the waist down wearing a bathing suit bottom with her pubic hair peeping out to the photo-sharing site last week.

However, she revealed to OysterMag.com today that the picture attracted so many complaints from users that her account - which had over 25,000 followers - has since been deleted.

Under fire: Petra Collins, the designer behind American Apparel's controversial menstruation T-shirt, has had her Instagram account deleted after uploading an image of her unshaven bikini line

The artist said dozens of people deemed her self-portrait 'horrible' and 'disgusting.' While it is no longer visible on Instagram, it remains uncensored on Miss Collins' Twitter account.

Voicing her annoyance, she wrote: 'To those who reported me, to those who are disgusted by my body . . . I want you to thoughtfully dissect your own reaction to these things.

'Please think about WHY you felt this way, WHY this image was so shocking, WHY you have no tolerance for it.'

She highlights that she did nothing to violate Instagram's terms of use.

Indeed, the basic guidelines on the site state: 'You may not post violent, nude, partially nude, discriminatory, unlawful, infringing, hateful, pornographic or sexually suggestive photos or other content via the Service.'

'In our 
society, nude or sexually suggestive images of women are automatically 
seen as negative'

Miss Collins continues: 'Unlike the 5,883,628 (this is how many images are tagged #bikini) bathing suit images on Instagram mine depicted my own unaltered state - an unshaven bikini line.'

She said that she now feels 'pressure to regulate' her body after being faced with a barrage of negative comments.

However, she defiantly adds: 'To all the young girls and women, do not let this discourage you, do not let anyone tell you what you should look like, tell you how to be, tell you that you do not own your body.'

Not all bad news: While her line of American Apparel T-shirts - which include the 'Period Tee' and another showing a woman's bare chest -  were initially slammed by shoppers, they are now close to selling out

In an interview with OysterMag.com last year Miss Collins said that she uses her work to get people confronting a reality they would rather ignore.

'I think teen sexuality is a taboo topic, specifically female sexuality. [It] tends to be ignored or looked down on.

'I find people are uncomfortable when
a woman is expressing her sexuality instead of repressing it. In our 
society, nude or sexually suggestive images of women are automatically 
seen as negative.

'We 
need to make room for the female view of sex and accept it. Until then, 
people are going to be uncomfortable with [work] like mine.'

Miss
Collins' work has been published in magazines including Vice and i-D 
and she acts as a contributing photographer for American Apparel.

She also runs and curates The Ardorous - an online platform for female artists. While her line of American Apparel T-shirts - which include the 'Period Tee' and another showing a woman's bare chest -  were initially slammed by shoppers, they are now close to selling out.
