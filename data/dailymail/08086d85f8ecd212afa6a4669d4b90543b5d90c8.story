Defence: Nick Clegg rebutted the clergy's charge that welfare cuts have been unfair

Nick Clegg has attacked high-ranking clergy for ‘exaggerating’ the effects of the Government’s welfare reforms.

Amid a growing row between ministers and church leaders, the Deputy Prime Minister reacted angrily to claims the ‘safety net’ for the vulnerable had been removed.

His comments came in response to an open letter signed by 27 of Britain’s 59 Anglican bishops which claimed hunger was a ‘national crisis’ and ministers had an ‘acute moral imperative’ to take action.

In their letter, the bishops, joined by 15 other faith leaders, said people in Britain are ‘going hungry’ and that 500,000 have visited food banks since Easter.

The letter came after a high-profile intervention by the Most Rev Vincent Nichols, leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales last week, who said the Coalition’s benefit savings had left people in a ‘destitute situation’ and reliant on food banks.

And it was backed yesterday by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who agreed with his colleague’s remarks and said there had been a ‘swell of feeling’ about the issue among rank and file clergy.

But Mr Clegg – who was asked about the issue by a food bank boss on his radio phone-in programme – rebutted the charge that welfare cuts have been unfair, saying failure to tackle the deficit would be irresponsible and that curbing welfare spending has to play a part.

Speaking on LBC Radio, Mr Clegg told the boss of the House of Bread food bank in Stafford: ‘We inherited this massive black hole in the public finances.

'There’s nothing fair about simply saying we’re not going to deal with our debts. We’re going to let our children and our grandchildren do it.’

The Most Rev Vincent Nichols, leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, said the Coalition¿s benefit savings had left people in a 'destitute situation' and reliant on food banks

He added: ‘What we’ve done is try to make sure that the way we reform welfare and we reform the tax system encourages people into work. I have a huge amount of respect for Vincent Nichols.

'I like him, I’ve met him a number of times but I think to say that the safety net has been removed altogether is an exaggeration.’

Mr Clegg went on to attack those who ‘denigrate’ welfare reforms, saying Britain is spending ‘billions of pounds’ protecting people who need support.

‘But what we’re doing,’ he said, ‘is simplifying the system and sharpening the incentive to work. It is surely better to see people in work rather than on benefits.’

To back up their charge that Britain is the world’s seventh largest economy and yet ‘people are going hungry’, 42 clergymen, including 27 Anglican bishops, made a series of startling claims. The Mail’s Social Affairs Correspondent Steve Doughty examines whether they stack up:

CLAIM: 5,500 people were admitted to hospital for malnutrition last year.

REALITY: The figure is correct, but malnutrition has very little to do with food shortage. In fact, the NHS advises that especially among children ‘malnutrition due to inadequate food intake in this country is rare, although it can occur if a child is being neglected or abused’. In adults, too, it is normally associated with another medical condition. Malnutrition includes obesity as well as the results of eating too little food.

CLAIM: Half a million people have visited food banks in the UK since last Easter.

REALITY: The Trussell Trust – which runs most food banks – said between last April and  December around 500,000 people were given three days’ worth of emergency food at its banks.

However, the Trust told the Mail  yesterday that the figures refer to requests for food, not the number of individuals making them. So the bishops do not know if 500,000 people have visited food banks once, or 50,000 have gone ten times.

CLAIM: One in five mothers report  regularly skipping meals to better feed  their children.

REALITY: The assertion appears to be based on a two-year-old survey of questionable academic value, in which the Netmums website polled 2000 of its members. Cathy Ranson of Netmums said: ‘We are due to re-run the study shortly with the Trussell Trust and see whether the situation has improved or become worse. No one has been in touch with us about using [the survey].’

CLAIM: Tens of thousands of older people must ‘heat or eat’ each winter.

REALITY: No-one doubts that life can be hard for poor pensioners, but there are fewer now than ever before.

The latest Government poverty estimates say that the number of pensioners below the official poverty line, 60 per cent of average income, dropped in 2011/12 by 100,000 from the previous year.

There were 1.9million pensioners considered poor, down from 2.8million in 1998/99.

CLAIM: Wages have stayed flat while food prices have gone up 30 per cent over the past five years.

REALITY: Food prices in real terms – after inflation is taken into account – were 12 per cent higher last summer than in 2007. Until last year, benefits were raised every year strictly in line with inflation. Whitehall estimates say that the poorest fifth of all families spent 16.6 per cent of their income on food and drink in  2011, almost exactly the same as the 16.8  per cent they spent in the year the recession struck, 2008.

CLAIM: Over half of people using food banks have been put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures in the benefit system.

REALITY: The Trussell Trust said in October that 19 per cent of its clients between April and September needed food because of benefit changes. A further 35 per cent of clients said they needed food because of delays in benefit payments, but these were nothing to do with recent welfare reforms.

Archbishop Welby, the leader of the world’s 80million Anglicans, said yesterday that the Church was well-placed to comment on welfare as it has people working ‘on the ground’ all over the country.

He said: ‘It is from the upswell of feeling that they are reporting that sense that they’re seeing in their own church communities, as priests, as ministers, as pastors, in whichever community that these letters and the comments of Cardinal Nichols are coming. And I’m entirely with him.’

Deputy Prime Minister yesterday challenged Nigel Farage to a debate on whether Britain should leave the EU.

In a high-risk move, Nick Clegg said he plans to launch an ‘aggressive’ defence of the EU.

But some Lib Dem insiders fear the party could be pushed into fifth place in the Euro elections on May 22, behind Mr Farage’s Ukip and even the Greens.

Ukip last night suggested that David Cameron and Ed Miliband should be invited to participate as well.

Mr Farage is expected to accept the challenge when he responds to Mr Clegg’s offer today.

But it emerged last night that a number of points in the bishops’ letter appeared to be based on questionable information.

For example, a claim that ‘one in five mothers report regularly skipping meals to better feed their children’ appears to have come from a two-year-old poll by Netmums.

And while the letter claimed that ‘over half of people using food banks’ had been ‘put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures of the benefits system’, a study found that only 19 per cent of those using food banks said they were doing so because of benefits changes.

Last week Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, told Radio 4’s Today Programme: ‘There are many cases where people are left without benefits, without any support for sometimes weeks on end.

‘The voices I hear express anger and despair. Something is going seriously wrong when, in a country as affluent as ours, there are people in that destitute situation depending on food banks.’

But a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said there was no robust evidence that welfare reforms were increasing food bank use.

They added: ‘It’s wrong to talk of removing a safety net when we’re spending £94billion a year on working age benefits and supporting millions of people.’

And a Number 10 spokesman said: ‘Of course many families are facing tough times as a result of the worst recession in a century.

‘That’s why our welfare reforms are about building a country where people are not trapped in a cycle of dependency but are able to get on, stand on their own two feet and build a better life for themselves and their family.’
