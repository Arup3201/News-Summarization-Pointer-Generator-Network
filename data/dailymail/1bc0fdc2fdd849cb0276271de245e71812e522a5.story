Shocking treatment: Pregnant woman Malaika Brooks (not pictured) was tasered three times by police officers after refusing to get out of the car when she stopped for speeding (file image)

A pregnant woman was tasered three times by police officers after she was pulled over for speeding while taking her son to school.

Malaika Brooks, who was due to give birth two months later, accepted that she had been travelling at 32mph in a 20mph zone outside the African American Academy in Seattle.

But when she refused to sign the ticket because she wrongly thought it was an admission of guilt, the officers moved in to arrest her.

She was ordered to get out of her vehicle, but she again refused to comply, so one officer twisted her arm behind her back while another tasered her in the thigh.

Thirty seconds later, she was tasered again, this time in her left arm followed by another jolt to her neck.

She finally fell over and was dragged face down into the street before being cuffed with her hands behind her back.

Ms Brooks, who went on to give birth to a healthy baby girl, was later convicted of refusing to sign the ticket, although not for resisting arrest.

Excessive force? Ms Brooks was hit in the thigh, arm and neck before being dragged out of her vehicle and handcuffed

But the case has made its way to highest court in the United States after the Seattle mother tried to sue the three officers for causing injuries that left her with three permanent scars.

The officers won a split decision in October from a 10-member panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco.

The judges ruled that the officers had used excessive force, but were not liable for damages because the law on the issue was not clear in 2004, when the incident happened, it was reported in the New York Times.

The taser had been used in 'drive-stun' mode, which delivers only localised pain, which the panel deemed not to be a safety threat.

Appeal: Although being cleared of using excessive force, the three officers have now gone to the Supreme Court (above) in an attempt to preserve the technique

But they said it could give rise to a lawsuit for a jury to decide on.

Chief Judge Alex Kozinski said Ms Brooks had been 'deaf to reason' and that the officers 'deserved our praise'.

But the cops have now decided to appeal to the Supreme Court in an attempt to clarify the law and preserve what they believe to be a 'useful pain technique.'

Ms Brooks, who is pursing claims under state law, has urged the court not to hear the appeal.

Michael Williams, a lawyer at Kirkland & Ellis, which represents Ms. Brooks, told the New York Times: 'The officers are trying to defend inexcusable conduct.

'They inflicted enormous pain on a woman who was especially vulnerable over what was essentially a traffic violation.'
