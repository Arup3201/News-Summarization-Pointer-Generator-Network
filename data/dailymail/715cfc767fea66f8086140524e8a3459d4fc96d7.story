A drink-driver banned for 14 months has been allowed by a court to live in his car.

Egidijus Sakalauska, 24, was spotted by police in Cambridge at 1.30am with defective lights and driving very slowly.

The Polish national told a court he had been 'dumped' by his girlfriend and he was trying to see her.

He pleaded guilty at Cambridge Magistrates' Court to drink-driving on October 27 while travelling in his Toyota Avensis.

He added that while he used to live in King's Lynn, Norfolk, he now lives in his car in Tilbury, Essex.

Sakalauska, a self-employed lorry driver, said: 'I have been in the UK for three months but am living in my car. Can I still do that now I am banned?'

Claire Robinson, chief magistrate, replied: 'We have heard you sleep in your car, but that is no excuse to drive it so do not be tempted.'

A roadside breath test showed Sakalauska had 54mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath, the legal limit being 35mg in 100ml of breath.

Paul Brown, prosecuting, said: 'He was suspected of being a drink-driver and was pulled over.

'He smelled of alcohol and he told police he been drinking 40 minutes previously.'

The defendant was fined £300 for the offence and ordered to pay a £30 victim surcharge and £85 court costs.

His 14-month disqualification from driving can be reduced by 14 weeks if he completes a drink-driver rehabilitation course.
