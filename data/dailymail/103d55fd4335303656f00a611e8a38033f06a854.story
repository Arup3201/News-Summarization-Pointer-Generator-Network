Somewhere, Cristiano Ronaldo will be watching this World Cup final. He is officially the best player on the planet this year but if his great rival writes his name all over the game’s greatest showpiece on Sunday night, who will ever remember that?

The Ballon d’Or winner went home a fortnight ago. Ronaldo was not able to carry a dreadful Portugal through the group stages on his own. Who knows if he will ever be back.

Lionel Messi, though, has been more  successful with his own personal crusade here in Brazil. This is not a great Argentina team - far from it - but Messi has hauled them to Rio, where they will face a Germany side who have been at their ruthless best in punishing opponents’ mistakes in this tournament. Germany are favourites to triumph, but don’t write off Messi seizing the opportunity to claim the final as his own.

The Argentina captain, Messi has led by example. At times he has found his best and consistent form elusive but his strength of will is equal perhaps to anyone who has ever played this game and, when it has mattered, he has dug as deep as he can go to find the contributions required.

Messi has scored four goals in the tournament. His last-minute winner against Iran in Argentina’s second game is one of the standout moments of this World Cup.

Equally important, though, was the run and pass that allowed Angel Di Maria to score against Switzerland in a last-16 game that the South Americans easily could have lost. This is what the really great players do. They make a difference.

According to his own father, Messi has been feeling tired as the tournament has progressed.

Certainly his influence against Holland in the semi-final was relatively muted and it is worth remembering that Barcelona’s season in La Liga continued competitively until the very last weekend.

5 - Lionel Messi has scored five goals at the World Cup, but he has never scored in the knockout stages

‘I spoke with him and he said he felt like his legs weighed 100 kgs,’ said Jorge Messi to a Brazilian newspaper.

Gary Lineker argues that Messi has not been at his best over the last month. He is not alone in that view.

Messi, though, is the type of footballer who doesn’t have to trample all over a football game in order to definitively influence it. To return to the Ronaldo theme, the Portuguese forward plays like it is an affront for anybody else on either team to actually have the ball. This is not Messi’s way.

The Argentina No 10 will drift in and out of games, choosing his moments to contribute. Against Belgium in the quarter-final, for example, he was quiet for long periods but the pass he slid through a needle’s eye to release Di Maria in the first half astonished those who were there to witness it.

Certainly, he will present Germany with a unique threat at the Maracana tomorrow. Many are waiting to see if the 27-year-old can personalise a World Cup final as Maradona did when Argentina beat Germany 3-2 in 1986. Maradona didn’t score that day in Mexico but, undoubtedly, it was his tournament.

Little magician: Diego Maradona single-handedly led Argentina to the World Cup in 1986 and to the final in 1990

Star: Holland's Arjen Robben (right) has arguably been the World Cup's best player

The 2014 version has not belonged solely to Messi. It has been a better tournament than that, more varied. Arjen Robben has arguably been its star individual but he is destined for a third-place contest against Brazil tonight after Holland fell to Argentina on Wednesday.

Germany will certainly present a more consistent and varied threat than Holland. They have also had a considerably more comfortable build-up to the final. Argentina and Messi played 120 minutes against Holland. A day earlier, Germany were able to release their foot from the gas after those remarkable opening 45 minutes against Brazil.

It is unlikely that Germany will worry about Messi as others have. Coach Joachim Low may consider moving his most reliable player Philipp Lahm back into midfield from full back in order to ‘look after’ the Argentina captain but, equally, he may feel the tactical intelligence, concentration and physicality of Bastian Schweinsteiger will be enough.

The danger of obsessing about Messi is clear. Holland did it to a degree on Wednesday which almost inevitably led to right-sided forward Ezequiel Lavezzi having one of his best games of the World Cup.

Adored: Messi can be heralded alongside Maradona if he inspires Argentina to their third World Cup

Race against time: Angel Di Maria is struggling to be fit for Argentina's final with Germany on Sunday

If the expressive and direct Di Maria regains fitness in time for Sunday, Germany’s rather modest full backs will have something else to do worry about, too.

Di Maria is unlikely to make it while it will be interesting to see if Sergio Aguero is fit enough to start. The Manchester City player has not made an impact here yet. He is another player, though, who has an immaculate sense of timing.

Germany, perhaps, do not have such striking individuals. It is tempting to label this final as one man against a machine. That would patronise Low’s team, though. They have scored 17 goals in this World Cup and have spread those across eight different players. Argentina, meanwhile, boast only four goalscorers.

Messi has brought his nation to this final admirably. Those from his country who have poured across the border to sleep in cars and on the beach in the Rio rain in recent days have come to see him crowned on the most fitting stage of all.

Germany are the team in form, though, and I expect them to win this final.

Time to shine? Sergio Aguero has been poor for Argentina so far but could light up the final

Machine: Germany have scored 17 goals so far at this World Cup and should be favourites for the final

Position: Germany's decision to shift Philipp Lahm back to full-back has benefited the side
