Lewis Hamilton is usually renowned for being a sharp dresser, but his choice of clothes for a charity event on Sunday looked like he might have been run over on the way there.

The F1 driver attended the London Collections Men: One For The Boys charity ball in London wearing a white shirt scrawled with a black paint mark over the front.

The 29-year-old's questionable dress sense didn't prevent actors Samuel L. Jackson, Daniel Bruhl and Simon Pegg from posing for pictures, which Hamilton swiftly posted on his Twitter account.

As if the furore of his feud with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg was not bad enough to contend with last month, Hamilton then gallingly suffered his second retirement of the season in Monaco.

The combined effect of both, however, now leaves him with the task of heading into the Red Bull Ring - as Austria returns to Formula One for the first time since 2003 - needing to regroup and refocus again.

Hamilton will have to learn quickly to get up to speed with Austria as it is a circuit he has never encountered before.
