The leader of a panel which was investigating brain tumour patient Ashya King's care has resigned - claiming his inquiry was being unfairly blocked.

Alistair Thompson said officers at Portsmouth City Council had been barred from taking part in his review, which is examining whether the council acted correctly when it won a High Court order to take the five-year-old away from his parents.

Ashya is now receiving the proton beam therapy which his parents wanted in Prague, three weeks after they sparked an international manhunt by fleeing with him on a cross-channel ferry.

Mr Thompson, a Conservative councillor in their home city of Portsmouth, Hampshire, was appointed to head the review after the authority became embroiled in the row last month.

The council obtained a legal order from the High Court making it the boy’s legal guardian after his parents took him from Southampton General Hospital to Spain.

But the order was subsequently lifted and wardship was returned to Ashya’s parents, Brett and Naghemeh King.

Councillor Thompson told the Portsmouth News: 'The council officers were not allowed in any shape or form to be involved in the review,

'That, in my mind, makes my position as the head of scrutiny of the panel void.

'We need to check that we obeyed the rules and applied them correctly.'

Optimistic: Ashya King is moved to the Proton Therapy Centre to start his proton treatment earlier this week

Conservative council leader Donna Jones hit back at the claims, saying she was unaware that the investigation had been anything but appropriate.

She said a separate review by the independent Portsmouth Local Safeguarding Children Board (PSCB) should be concluded and should take priority over the internal review.

Ashya’s parents sparked an international police hunt when they removed their five-year-old son from Southampton General Hospital on August 28 without medical consent.

They wanted him to receive proton beam therapy which was not available for him on the NHS and which he is now undergoing in Prague.

Looking pale but alert, he had his first session of the long-awaited cancer therapy two days ago after he was flown to the Czech capital by private jet.

Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45, were reunited with their son after 72 hours in jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow Ashya to undergo proton therapy in Eastern Europe

The Proton Therapy Centre released a schedule for the first day of Ashya's treatment for a brain tumour, which saw him leave the University Hospital Motol to undergo irradiation.

His attending doctor, radiation oncologist Dr Barbora Ondrova, said: 'There is a 70 to 80 per cent survival rate for the condition such as Ashya has - and there is now every reason to hope that he will make a full recovery.'
