Elnathan John, a writer and lawyer living in Nigeria’s capital Abuja, used the current measles outbreak in the U.S. to poke fun at American’s overreaction to the Ebola virus

A Nigerian writer has used the current measles outbreak in the U.S. to poke fun at American’s overreaction to the Ebola virus during which some politicians called for a travel ban on impacted west African countries. 

Elnathan John, a writer and lawyer living in Nigeria’s capital Abuja, jokingly called for screenings to prevent the highly contagious measles virus from spreading abroad.

‘Our thoughts are also with the measles-ravaged country America. I hope we are screening them before they come to Africa,’ he tweeted on Sunday.

Concerns about people from African countries bringing Ebola into the U.S. reached fever pitch last October after Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan died in a Texas hospital.

Politicians, including Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry, quickly called for an air travel ban from countries hit hardest by the virus which is actually much harder to catch than measles.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll last October also found that more than 70 percent of Americans supported such a ban on civilian air travel, although experts questioned how useful such a measure would be in containing the disease.

John’s comment has been retweeted more than 15,000 times, with some people applauding him for his snark and others taking offense, reports Raw Story. He later confirmed via another tweet that he had been joking.

'I’m just kidding America. You know I love you – measles, guns, Kim Kardashian and all,' he tweeted.

There remains a growing concern that the U.S. could become gripped by a measles epidemic, according to the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said his agency is 'very concerned' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the U.S. 

His fears come as a growing number of people who have not been vaccinated against the disease are being exposed to the rest of the population.

The outbreak is due in to  the ‘anti-vaxxer movement’ - parents who believe that childhood vaccinations can cause autism in children.

 Vaccination: A child gets a vaccinated, but in southern California, eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella

Health officials have pushed back against the movement, pointing out a study often cited by anti-vaxxers has been thoroughly discredited.

In the midst of a measles outbreak, President Barack Obama has been telling parents to get their kids vaccinated. 

The president said a major success of civilization is the ability to prevent diseases that have been devastating in the past.

More than 100 cases of the measles have been reported in 14 states since last month. Many cases have been traced directly or indirectly to Disneyland in Southern California.

Frieden said in an interview on CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday: 'What we've seen is, as over the last few years, a small but growing number of people have not been vaccinated. 

John confirmed via a second tweet than he had been joking and then listed the things he loves about America including 'gun and Kim Kardashian'

Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC said his agency is 'very concerned' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the U.S.

'That number is building up among young adults in society, and that makes us vulnerable.

'We have to make sure that measles doesn't get a foothold in the U.S. It's been actually eliminated from this country for 15 years. 

'All of our cases result, ultimately, from individuals who have traveled and brought it back here.'

At last count, there were 102 reported cases of measles in 14 states across the country.

However, this looks set to grow.

The CDC has now launched an aggressive campaign to combat the spread of the disease which can be highly contagious.

Measles is much easier to pass on to others than Ebola
