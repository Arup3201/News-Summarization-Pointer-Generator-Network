Police officers performing a welfare check Monday discovered a legless corpse in a bathtub, a bloody chain saw in the kitchen and a plastic-wrapped human body inside a Las Vegas home where a man is accused of killing and dismembering his mother and sister, according to newly released court documents.

Severed legs were later found in a freezer, and a store receipt for a chain saw and ear plugs turned up in a vehicle where suspect Darius Sorrells, 30, was arrested Saturday, the police report said.

A North Las Vegas judge on Wednesday ordered Sorrells held without bail and gave prosecutors until April 9 to file criminal charges in the slayings of his mother, Janice Burden, 53, and sister Natasha Sorrells, 33.

The women were last heard from last week, and police visited the home twice — on Friday and Sunday — before finally entering through a broken back door and finding the house of horrors before dawn on Monday, North Las Vegas police Sgt. Chrissie Coon said.

'Multiple conversations we had with family and friends led us to put two and two together,' Coon said.

A friend told police that Natasha Sorrells had recently awoken to find her brother standing over her holding a crow bar. He warned her to be careful around him, but the 33-year-old woman replied that she loved Darius and wanted to help him, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Neighbors and relatives told investigators that Darius Sorrells was mentally unstable.

Sorrells declined to speak with investigators following his arrest, Coon said. He was expected to be appointed a public defender at his next court appearance.

The police report said he showed no reaction when he was told he was under arrest in the deaths of his mother and sister.

Police believe he killed the two women before beginning to dismember his sister's corpse in the bathtub.

The Clark County coroner announced Thursday that Natasha Sorrells, whose body was found with severed legs, died from a head injury. The coroner hasn't said what killed the mother.

Burden's body was found wrapped so tightly in layers of clear plastic and blue painter's tape that police who entered the modest two-story stucco home described it as a 'mummy.'

Officers also found black vinyl gloves at the foot of the stairs, trash bags, an empty bottle of bleach and patches of ripped-out carpet.

A bloody handprint was found on a bathtub wall, and decomposing flesh on the tile floor, the police report said. A trash can was in the middle of the living room; a green wheelbarrow next to the fireplace.

One officer noted what appeared to be blood spray on couch cushions.

The chain saw was found disassembled on the kitchen counter, along with knives, screwdrivers and a drain plunger. Human blood was found on the saw blade and throughout the house, which was permeated with the smell of incense mingled with overwhelming stench.

Police said home improvement store video showed Mr Sorrells buying the machine Friday morning.

Coon said they last had contact with family members and friends last Wednesday or Thursday. She said police were informed Friday that the women were missing and hadn't been seen at work.

Before police responded to the house early Monday morning, a family friend stopped by to check on Burden and Sorrells on behalf of their relatives, who haven’t heard from either woman for several days, according to Las Vegas Sun.

After getting permission from Burden's other son, the friend kicked in the back door and entered the residence, where chaos reigned.

Initially, the friend thought that a sewer pipe had burst, filling the home with stench and leaving the floors covered in a dark, sticky fluid. It later turned out to be blood.

Sorrells is the only suspect in the slayings, Coon said. His arrest came after he was found about 3am Saturday driving a 2004 GMC Envoy erratically a couple of miles from the home.

The vehicle sped away from a shopping center parking lot and at one point drove into oncoming traffic lanes before crashing into a light pole, police said.

Coon said Sorrells fled on foot toward nearby railroad tracks before he was caught.

The man told detectives that he had a memory loss of 'every event before his arrest.'
