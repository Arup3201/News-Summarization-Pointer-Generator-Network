Nathaniel Clyne was the hero for Southampton as they knocked fellow Premier League side Arsenal out of the Capital One Cup with a 2-1 win at the Emirates Stadium. 

Alexis Sanchez's sumptuous free-kick gave Arsenal the lead but goals from Dusan Tadic and Nathaniel Clyne earned the visitors an impressive victory and a place in the Capital One Cup fourth round in the process.

Here Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel gives his thoughts on the main talking points from the game.

CLYNE SENSATIONAL AGAIN

How long before Nathaniel Clyne gets an England call-up? He’s been on the cusp of the senior squad in recent months, so his wonder strike last night will do his chances no harm at all.

DIABY'S WELCOME RETURN

It was one of those ‘I was there moments’. Abou Diaby started his first game for Arsenal in 556 days against Southampton. The Frenchman’s injury problems have been well documented; now Arsene Wenger will hope he can stay clear of the treatment room this season.

EXPENSIVE CUP FAILURE

Arsenal Supporters’ Trust hit out at the £3million fee paid to owner Stan Kroenke. The amount was detailed in the club’s latest set of financial results, released last week, as payment for strategic and advisory services. And Trust spokesman Tim Payton tweeted: ‘Stan Kroenke imposes a 3 per cent ticket price rise on fans that raises circa £3m, then he bills Arsenal £3m for his advisory fees. How convenient!’
