Michael's death came 'very suddenly', with TMZ reporting that Omarosa was present in the hospital room before momentarily leaving for a short period of time and when she returned he had died.

Her mother is believed to have been present when he passed.

Meanwhile, Michael's Green Mile co-star Tom Hanks also released a heartfelt message, referring to the actor as 'Big Mike'.

the loss of Big Mike. He was the treasure we all discovered on the set 
of The Green Mile. He was magic.

'He was a big love of man and his

And the director of the movie, Frank Darabont, was 'devastated', saying: '[He was] one of the finest people I’ve ever had the privilege to work with or know. Michael was the gentlest of souls - an exemplar of decency, integrity and kindness. The sadness I feel is inexpressible.'

The 6ft 5in, 300 pound star appeared in 
dozens of films, including box office hits Armageddon, Planet Of The 
Apes and Kung Fu Panda.

Duncan had a handful of minor roles 
before The Green Mile brought him an Academy Award nomination for Best 
Supporting Actor in 1999, but unfortunately he lost out to Michael 
Caine after the British legend won his second Oscar to The Cider House Rules.

The film, based on the Stephen King 
novel of the same name, starred Tom Hanks as a corrections officer at a 
penitentiary in the 1930s. Duncan played John Coffey, a convicted 
murderer.

He
 was also nominated a further nine times, along with his Oscar nod, 
receiving recognition at the Golden Globes, MTV Movie Awards and Screen 
Actors Guild Awards.

As news of the tragic actor was revealed, celebrity tributes poured in via Twitter, with former NBA star Kenny Smith stating he was due to visit Duncan tomorrow.

Before finding fame in Tinseltown, Chicago native Michael worked as a labourer, digging ditches for a gas company.

He then headed to the bright lights of Hollywood, in touching distance of 
the limelight but still behind the scenes as he found work as a 
bodyguard for stars including Jamie Foxx and Will Smith.

When one of his clients, the Notorious B.I.G. was killed in 1997, Michael left the security business.

But luck was on his side, and the following year, he landed a role in Armageddon, before going on to star in a string of hits.

He continued his success for over a decade, working right up until his death.

His final role is 
yet-to-be released From The Rough, a sports drama based on the true 
story of Catana Starks, a former swimming coach (played by Taraji P. 
Henson) who became the first woman ever to coach a college men’s golf team.

Duncan was not averse to the occasional flop however, with his TV show The Finder bombing after just one season earlier this year. The Fox series was a spin-off of Bones, but failed to wow.

In July, Michael suffered a 
heart attack and remained in intensive care  for several weeks after.

At the time, his
 representative Joy said in a statement: 'His family are firm believers 
in the power of prayer and have asked that you keep him in yours during this time.'

TMZ originally
 broke the story that Michael's 38-year-old girlfriend performed 'heroic
 CPR and re-started' the actor's heart at his LA home before he was 
rushed to the hospital.

'Everyday GOD continues to smile upon my luv Michael Clarke Duncan on this arduous road to recovery,' Omarosa tweeted last month to her 30,000 followers.

'God is with us every step of the way!!'

The
 pair were together for two years and the former Apprentice contestant 
had been referring to the large star as 'my hubby' and 'my love' as she 
tended to his bedside.

According to TMZ, 'an army of people'
 were caring for Duncan, who was 'breathing above the respirator' and 
had a 'very strong heartbeat' after initial tests were performed on him.

Kent Moran, who directed Duncan in The Challenger, told MailOnline the actor recently wrapped on the action drama, in which he plays a trainer helping to revive the career of boxer Jaden Miller.

Moran, who also stars as Miller in the film, described Duncan as 'very healthy' on set and said he coped well with the physicality of the role, adding that news of the actor falling ill was 'unexpected.'

He added: 'We were very surprised and saddened to hear the news. Our film is now in post production and we have finished filming Michael's scenes.

'So at this point, we are really just praying for him and wishing him a speedy recovery.'
