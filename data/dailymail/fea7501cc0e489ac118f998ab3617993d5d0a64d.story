The wife of a New York lawyer who publicly trashed her husband has been awarded just 17 per cent of his $5million partnership, after a judge found her allegations hurt his business.

Janice Schacter, 51, accused her now ex-husband Ira Schacter, 54, of being abusive and buying a Playboy model a $200,000 engagement ring while refusing to pay for his daughter's $12,000 hearing aids.

She had made the allegations over the course of the couple's seven-year-long divorce battle, which Mr Schacter claimed damaged his business at Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft.

Justice Laura Drager agreed with Mr Schacter's claim and cut his ex-wife's share of the partnership from roughly $2.5million to $855,000, according to the New York Daily News.

In the ruling, made public yesterday, Drager wrote that 'in essence, the wife chose to bite the hand that fed her.'

She wrote: 'Although the court recognizes that the wife feels she was badly treated by the husband, her repeated attacks against him have played a part in diminishing his income.'

The couple were married in 1988 and had two children, now aged 19 and 15, before splitting in 2007 after both were arrested for allegedly assaulting one another.

Mr Schacter filed for divorce two days after his wife got an order of protection barring him from their home. Criminal charges, however, were dropped.

In 2011 Mrs Schacter alleged her husband was not paying for his daughter's $12,000 hearing aids, but had spent more than $200,000 on an engagement ring for his then fiancee, Playboy model Lace Rose Allenius, who later reportedly broke off the engagement.

In her ruling, Drager said the allegation about the hearing aids was wrong and said Mrs Schacter's allegations were a factor in her ex-husband's drop in business.

According to the New York Post, the ruling described the divorce action as 'one of the most contentious litigations this court has ever presided over'.

Mrs Schacter criticised the judge's ruling as she told the paper: 'I bit the hand that hurt me, not fed me.'

The ruling however left Mrs Schacter with half of the couple's $10.5million in other assets, including proceeds from the sales of a $4.4million townhouse and a $4.5million summer home in Bridgehampton.

She will also reportedly receive up to $21,000 a month in spousal and child support along with the couple's Lexus.
