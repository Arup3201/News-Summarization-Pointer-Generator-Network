A former Portsmouth Football Club player is among a group of 11 alleged Islamic convert terrorists arrested in France for targeting Jews.

Yann Nsaku, 19, was a youth team centre-half at Pompey before he suffered a career-ending knee injury a year ago.

The 6ft 2ins French passport holder, whose family is originally from Congo, returned to his hometown of Cannes, in the south of France, where he converted to Islam and is said to have become a violent jihadist, or holy warrior.

Under siege: Armed police on operation in Cannes, southeastern France, where Nsaku was arrested at his home in front of his shocked parents

On Saturday, armed police swooped on his home in the seaside resort and arrested him in front of his tearful parents.

At
 one stage they had dreams of him becoming a Premiership player after 
launching his career with Portsmouth, the 2008 FA Cup winners.

But
 coordinated nationwide raids on Saturday also saw Jeremy Sidney, a 
33-year-old friend of Nsaku, blasted to death in front of his pregnant 
wife and children in Strasbourg, eastern France.

Another
 gunman called Jeremy Bailly was arrested in the Paris suburb of Torcy 
as he carried a loaded .22 calibre rifle from a mosque prayer room.

All
 of the men were said to have been involved in a grenade attack on a 
Jewish food shop in Paris on September 19th which saw one man injured.

Their aim was to start a 'war across France', and to see a wholly Muslim state established in France, said a police source.

Co-ordinated: The anti-terror operation was carried out in several cities around France, notably in Strasbourg where a suspect was fatally wounded

Nsaka,
 who had spent short loan spells with other English clubs, and also 
played for Cannes and the Congo youth team, was at one time tipped to 
become the new Patrick Vieira, the former Arsenal and France World Cup 
winner.Â 

Speaking 
from the family home in Cannes, Nsaku's Christian father, Philip, 
admitted that his son had become 'increasingly influenced' by Sidney and
 converted to Islam soon after leaving Pompey.

Mr Nsaku said his son had argued 
furiously with other family members 10 days ago, and it has been a 
'constant battle' to keep him on the rails.

Mr Nsaku said his wife 'collapsed in tears' when their son was arrested at home, but said that 'he had not become a bad boy overnight' and that 'for all of us, (his arrest) may be a salvation.'

Crime scene investigation: Police leave the building in Strasburg, eastern France, where a man linked to the extremist Salafist group was shot dead

Police say that many of the young men arrested had made wills, and carried a list of Jewish groups they were targeting.

All
 the men arrested were said to be linked to a Salafist group which was 
committed to waging a jihad - or holy war - across Europe.

It follows Mohammed Merah, a 23-year-old French Algerian with similar Salafism connections, shooting seven people, including four Jews, dead in the Toulouse area in March.

At least three policemen were injured in Saturday's Strasboug raid, while others received direct hits to their bullet proof jackets and helmets.

Police have been on heightened alert since the attacks by Merah, who was himself finally shot dead by police.

A police spokesman in France confirmed that Nsaku could be held for up to 96 hours and faced a range of terrorism charges, which would prolong his period in custody indefinitely.
