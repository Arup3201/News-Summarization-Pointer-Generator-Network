Samantha Cameron is to hit the campaign trail as part of a Tory strategy to keep her husband in Number 10.

Conservative strategists believe the PM's wife could be a secret weapon in the battle for re-election on May 7.

The couple appeared together yesterday in the first of many campaign visits, but David Cameron admitted that the pressures of wooing voters means their regular date nights will have to be put on hold.

Mrs Cameron has secured a broadly positive press since moving into Number 10 five years ago, largely by keeping below the radar.

Many of her appearances have been linked to her charities, including Save The Children, Comic Relief and Tickets For Troops.

She has also championed the creative industries, hosting events in Downing Street to mark London Fashion Week.

But she is now expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last week to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister.

She said: 'He's definitely for my mind the best man for the job.

'I hope that me and the family help him to keep things in perspective - keep him grounded - help him to pace himself over the next eight weeks.'

And yesterday they were filmed together discussing their hospital visits with son Ivan, who died in 2009.

The couple appeared at Salford Royal Hospital on Saturday, where they spoke to patient Tom Lawrence about their hospital visits with son Ivan, who died in 2009

Mrs Cameron managed to avoid being caught pulling an embarrassing expression, something her husband did not acheive

They were seen speaking to a patient during a visit to Salford's Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester.

The PM said: 'When our son was very ill, we often went into hospital and it is very difficult to get out at the weekend.'

Mrs Cameron added: 'On a Friday, if we thought there was any chance that we could get home, I was like: 'We've got to get out this afternoon'.'

The Tory leader has made much of his regular 'date nights', slipping out of Downing Street to visit trendy restaurants like Kitty Fisher's in Mayfair and the celeb haunt Chiltern Firehouse.

But the nights out will have to be shelved while the couple focus on winning votes.

During the five years of the coalition, many of Mrs Cameron's media appearances have been linked to charity work, including this visit with Save The Children to a refugee settlement in Lebanon, close to the Syria border in March 2013

He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I think that will probably be a bit testing. I think there won't be much time for some of those things.

'Samantha's going to be on the campaign trail with me. She has also got other things she has to do, including making sure the children make it to school every day.'

But he played down the idea that he spends too much time 'chillaxing' instead of focussing on running the country.

'I work bloody hard,' he insisted. 'I'm normally up before six at my kitchen table working away. I certainly was today.'

But he went on to add: 'I do try to make sure that [I] don't get exhausted. I try to get a decent amount of sleep. I try to spend some time with my family.

'My view is, the most important thing as Prime Minister is trying to make the right judgments. In order to make good judgments, you need good advice, you need good principles and you need a clear head and you need to have a sense of equilibrium.'
