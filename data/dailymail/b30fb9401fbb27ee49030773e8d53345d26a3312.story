A UK tourist is accused of using a secret device sewn into his shorts to sent points information to an accomplice in a betting scam.

Daniel Thomas Dobson, 22, was arrested after a match where he allegedly used the device to wirelessly send points information to an international betting agency before the action reached tv screens. 

Dobson was said to have used the advantage of the 10 second delay between action and live tv to send the data and affect the betting odds.

Melbourne Magistrates Court was told that Dobson had 
allegedly had the device built into his shorts and linked to his mobile 
phone.

He was allegedly affecting the betting odds of the Grand Slam championship, the Australian tennis Open.

Police are now searching for two other Britons in relation to the alleged offence, known as 'courtsiding', following Dobson's appearance in court yesterday.

Police prosecutor Josh Diemar told the court: 'He sent the agency the results before they could get them through the official channels.

'That data has been sent quicker than the official results can get posted, and had the ability to affect betting odds.'

Mr Sass Nasimi, representing Dobson, said the Briton was collecting legitimate data for the betting agency.

He said: 'The data was used to protect the agency from fluctuating odds.

Charged: Dobson is charged with allegedly relaying match scores to an international betting service from courtside at the Australian Open on Tuesday

'It is an exercise of collecting data about who has won a point.' The Briton, who was earlier said by police to have flown into Melbourne to specifically monitor matches at the Australian Open, was charged with one count of engaging in conduct that would corrupt a betting outcome - believed by detectives to be the first charge of its kind in the world.

It has not been revealed what match Dobson had been monitoring before his arrest.

Deputy Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said: 
'We believe he is part of a syndicate, but we don't yet have the 
details. I don't think it's an isolated incident.

'Overseas, certainly, there are examples in relation to football, in relation to cricket.

'It's
 been around for several years. It's particularly becoming more 
difficult to do because of the speed of communications and technology 
but it is still very active.

'As we know, the global tennis 
betting market is in the tens of millions of dollars every day.' Among 
the big names of tennis playing at the Open are Britain's Andy Murray, 
Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Maria 
Sharapova.

The magistrate adjourned the case until January 23 so the defence and prosecution could prepare for the charge, brought under legislation introduced in the state of Victoria last year covering offences related to cheating at gambling.

Court: The case was heard at Melbourne Magistrates Court on Thursday
