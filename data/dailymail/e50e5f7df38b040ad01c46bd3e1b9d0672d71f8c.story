Her fully frontal nude photoshoot for Paper magazine has got everyone talking, much to her delight.

But three years ago, Kim Kardashian was a little less eager to bare all.

During a January 2011 episode of Kourtney & Kim Take New York, Kim had a meltdown at the prospect of being seen nude on the cover of W magazine.

Meltdown: Kim broke down on a 2011 episode of Kourtney & Kim Take New York after seeing  revealing nude photographs of herself in W magazine

Changed your mind Kim? The reality star was so upset by her nude W magazine cover, left, that she had a televised meltdown back in 2011, but happily posed for this Paper magazine cover back in September

'Oh my God, I'm more naked than I was in Playboy!' she wept. 'I'm so mad right now. She promised I would be covered with artwork. You can see nipple. The whole concept was sold to me that nothing would be seen.

'This really pisses me off… this is serious porn!' she added at the cover story, which was entitled Kim Kardashian: The Art of Reality.

The cover photo shows Kim nude, but her modesty was protected by bars. Inside shots featured the star nearly completely covered in metallic body paint.  

I'm never going naked again: The reality show star 

Please don't judge me: 'I don’t want people to be like, "All she’s good for is, you know, being naked," she added

Kim told sister Kourtney that the magazine's artist would put 'images of architecture and buildings and stuff on top of me so you will see my body shape and the outline but not actually my boobs or anything.' 

So when showed the rather revealing snapshots, Kim freaked out, and was nearly hysterical when she called her mother Kris Jenner. 

'I feel so taken advantage of,' sobbed Kim, who found fame thanks to a leaked sex tape.

 'I've definitely learned my lesson… I'm never taking my clothes off again, even if it’s for Vogue.

'I don’t want people to be like, "All she’s good for is, you know, being naked," she added.

'I feel so taken advantage of': Kim was eager to move away from the sex tape leaked in 2007 

Reassurance: Kris Jenner tried to comfort Kim by telling her the pictures were gorgeous 

Attempting to carve out a career as a businesswoman and TV star, Kim was perhaps, at that time, eager to move on from her sex tape which catapulted her to fame in 2007.

Now happily married to rapper Kanye West and having lost more than 50 lbs in baby weight, Kim was clearly keen to bare all, even telling her sisters during a 2013 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians: 'As soon as I pop this [baby] out - as soon as I get in shape - the first thing I want to do is Playboy or some nude shoot.

'I just wanna walk down the street fully naked. I'm gonna be the sexy hot mom.'

And it's clear Kim was eager to perform her about-turn in style, appearing full-frontal in the inside pages of Paper magazine, along with the striking front cover which shows her grinning at the camera while baring her ample  bare  booty covered in baby oil.

Another picture, in the shoot by famed photographer Jean-Paul Goude showed Kim wearing a cocktail dress and recreating Goude's well-known Champagne Incident shot, with bubbly shooting into the air and landing into a glass,perfectly placed on her posterior.

And if anyone wondered if Kim had to be talked into posing for the naked shot, they can think again.

In an interview published on Yahoo Style, Paper's editorial director Mickey Boardman explained that it was all Kim's idea.

'Kim’s attitude was "if we’re gonna do it, let’s really go there,"' he said. 

'And it was her idea to take off her clothes and show more than her butt. But we [Paper] didn’t say "let’s do a cover with your butt hanging out."

'She said she was willing to take her clothes off and one thing lead to another.' 

Trending: Kim certainly lit up the internet with comical discussion of her new magazine cover, available online at Paper.com
