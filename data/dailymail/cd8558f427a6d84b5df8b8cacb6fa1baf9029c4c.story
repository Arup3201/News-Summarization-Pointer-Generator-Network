Love them or hate them, emoticons are creeping into more and more apps, social networks and websites.

But, rather than being a new trend, it appears the expressive characters first appeared in print more than a century ago.

On 30 March 1881, four emoticons, described as typographical art, were published in American satirical magazine Puck. 

On 30 March 1881, four emoticons, described as typographical art, were published in  satirical magazine Puck (pictured). They were dubbed 'vertical emoticons' because they are viewed vertically, rather than horizontally

They have been dubbed 'vertical emoticons' because they are viewed vertically, rather than horizontally. 

In the tongue-in-cheek article, Puck wrote: 'We mean to let the public see what we can lay out, in our own typographical line, all the cartoonists that ever walked. 

'For fear of startling the public we will only give a small specimen of the artistic achievements within our grasp, by way of a first installment.'

Computer scientist Scott Fahlman was the first documented person to use typed characters as a way of expressing emotion.

In a message to the board at Carnegie Mellon University in 1982, Mr Fahlman suggested :-) and :-( should be used to distinguish between jokes and serious posts.

But, there is some suggestion that emoticons were used much earlier, even before the 1881 issue of Puck.

Reports claim Abraham Lincoln used a ‘winky face’ in a 1862 speech. 

The transcript records the audience's response to Mr Lincoln's  introduction as: 'applause and laughter ;).'

But this is generally considered to be a typo. 

Similarly, a Robert Herrick poem from 1648 appears to feature a smiley face after the words ‘smiling yet’.

In the second line of To Fortune, published in Hesperides, the poem reads: Tumble me down, and I will sit, Upon my ruins, (smiling yet:), Tear me to tatters, yet I'll be patient in my necessity.'

This is also considered to be a typo, and its connection to the word 'smiling' is a coincidence.  

Below this text are four 'faces' drawn to show joy, melancholy, indifference and astonishment.

Emoticons were the successor to emojis. The word emoji literally means 'picture'(e) + 'letter' (moji).

A study in April last year found that the top trending word, at that time, was emoji.

In addition to being used on mobiles, the pictographs have since been added to websites including Twitter and Facebook. 

But, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium.

Since 2010 a basic list has been developed and maintained by this consortium - a Silicon Valley-based non-profit organisation made up of major computer firms, software producers, user groups and others.

Emoji (selection pictured) were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online, however, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere. The word emoji literally means 'picture'(e) + 'letter' (moji)

Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online.

However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere.

Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'
 (e) + 'letter' (moji).

Icons
 are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as
 a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white
 flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji 
representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese 
curry, and sushi.

Some 
emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them 
to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could now be added.

Twitter allowed emoji to be used on its web version, as well across its apps, last month.

And last year, Apple was said to be working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular characters for the iPhone.

Following complaints the current character set was not diverse enough, the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them.

And there are now apps dedicated purely to the small images.

Emojli, for example, only lets users communicate using the popular miniature images - and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons.
