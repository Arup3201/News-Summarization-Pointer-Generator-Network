The families of three Red Caps murdered by a mob in Iraq ditched a controversial lawyer amid claims he was also representing their alleged killers.

Relatives of corporals Simon Miller and Russell Aston and Lance Corporal Thomas Keys dropped Phil Shiner over concerns he had a ‘disgusting’ conflict of interest.

Mr Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers is representing Iraqi families at the £22million Al Sweady Inquiry into claims that British soldiers tortured and abused detainees in 2004. Claims that detainees were executed have been dropped.

The Red Cap families believe some of those taking legal action were ‘directly or indirectly responsible’ for the deaths of the Royal Military Policemen a year earlier.

Last night John Miller, 63, the father of Cpl Miller, said: ‘I believe there is a conflict of interest involving Phil Shiner because both cases are inextricably linked. We feel betrayed by him.

‘It is disgraceful, utterly disgusting, that he would try to represent us while having the Iraqis on his books who I believe are the main antagonists.

‘The families have been brought over to London, had flights paid for, put up in hotels, and making legal claims here. I believe they are, or know, the murderers of the Royal Military Policemen.’

Cpl Aston, 30, Cpl Miller, 21, and L/Cpl Keys, 20, plus Corporal Paul Long, 24, Sergeant Simon Hamilton-Jewell, 41 and Lance Corporal Benjamin Hyde, 23, were slaughtered in Majar al Kabir, near Basra, in 2003.

They were cornered by hundreds of locals at a police station and then executed. Their killers have never been brought to justice. The inquest into their deaths heard evidence that the soldiers had too little ammunition, old radios and no satellite phone when they were ambushed.

The relatives first had contact with Mr Shiner in 2011. Out of frustration at questions over their loved ones’ deaths not being answered satisfactorily by the MoD, four families accepted his offer to fight their case.

Only one relative, Patricia Long – mother of Cpl Long – was granted legal aid. But after learning that the lawyer was also involved in the Al Sweady case, three families backed out.

Phil Shiner is representing a number of Iraqi civilians who claim to have been abused and tortured by members of the British military

Mr Shiner, 57, has made his name pursuing British soldiers through the courts over alleged war crimes in Iraq. He has represented alleged victims of abuses by troops, including relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 in British custody.

He was awarded the title Human Rights Lawyer of the Year in 2004.

On his firm’s website, his profile reads: ‘Phil is a committed socialist and the roots of his career as a lawyer are firmly planted in the law centre movement of the 1980s.’

He was the prime mover behind the Al Sweady hearing into allegations that troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others near Basra in 2004. The Iraqis had alleged troops from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took bloody revenge at a camp and detention facility for the massacre of the six Royal Military policemen. The claims were strenuously denied by the MoD, which insisted the men were insurgents killed in battle.

Last month, the allegations were sensationally dropped at the year-long war crimes hearing after lawyers said that there was no evidence they were killed in cold blood.

Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers is still representing another 1,500 Iraqis who claim they are the victims of British abuse. The firm has already been paid millions from the public purse, including around £3million in legal aid for the Al Sweady Inquiry.

In an email to Mr Miller, Mr Shiner denied any conflict of interest. He said: ‘For obvious reasons, I did the most careful conflict of interest checking process before I agreed to take on Pat Long’s case.

‘That is required by the rules but was even more important in the very obviously sensitive circumstances of Pat’s case. I can assure you that that exercise has been conducted and that there is no conflict of interest.’

He was not available for comment yesterday. The Solicitors Regulation Authority code of conduct states: ‘If there is a conflict, or a significant risk of a conflict, between two or more current clients, you must not act for all or both of them unless the matter falls within the scope of the limited exceptions.’

A legal source told the Mail that because the Red Caps and Al Sweady cases were separate, it was unlikely a conflict of interest would occur, even though there were links.
