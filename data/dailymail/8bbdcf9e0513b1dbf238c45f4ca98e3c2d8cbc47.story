Arsenal are showing interest in Lorient left-back Raphael Guerreiro, who has been capped twice by Portugal.

Guerreiro was named in the Ligue 2 team of the year while playing for Caen before earning a move to top tier Lorient in 2013.

The 21-year-old has played himself into the first team at the French club as a defender but can also operate on the wing.
