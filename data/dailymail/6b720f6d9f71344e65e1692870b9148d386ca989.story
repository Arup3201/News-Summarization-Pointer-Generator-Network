Brighton’s home win against Birmingham City was overshadowed when two fans were arrested for racist chanting and throwing a smoke bomb.

Chief Inspector Simon Nelson revealed on Twitter that two arrests had been made during the game – one suspected Brighton fan and one suspected Birmingham fan.

The racist chanting was suspected to be a Seagulls fan and the person in question was arrested during the game at the Amex Stadium.

The news comes just days after a minority of Chelsea fans came under fire for racist chanting in Paris.

A group of men appeared to stop a black man from entering the train ahead of their Champions League clash with PSG on Tuesday.
