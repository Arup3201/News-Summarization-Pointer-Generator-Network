A record-holding American freediver died Sunday afternoon shortly after emerging from the water during a diving tournament in the Bahamas.

Nicholas Mevoli, 32, of Brooklyn, New York, dove to a depth of more than 200 feet and returned to the surface - he soon had trouble breathing, passed out and was soon pronounced dead.

The New York man's identity was first reported by the Long Island (Bahamas) Runner. A blog post written last by Mr Mevoli shows he had barely escaped death at least one other time.

The incident happened around 2 p.m. 
Sunday off the coast of the Bahamas' Long Island, which is about 164 
miles (265 kilometers) southeast of the capital of Nassau.

The novice competitive diver had reached a depth of 72 meters, about 236 feet, before attempting to surface, according to a press release from AIDA International.

He was trying to break a record for the deepest 'Constant No Fins' free dive, according to an event organizer.

Mr Mevoli was brought to shore, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to revive him as he was transported to a local hospital.

The television industry veteran was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the hospital, the release added.

The nine-day International Free Diving Competition Mr Mevoli took part in brings 56 free divers from 21 countries. The divers compete for a $20,000 prize won by the brave soul who can dive the deepest without fins or scuba gear.

The contest takes place at Dean's Blue Hole, which is considered the world's deepest underwater sinkhole in seawater, the rest of it was cancelled after Mr Mevoli's death.

Mr Mevoli had only been diving competitively since last year, AIDA noted, but had been very successful during his short career.

'Nick was an extraordinary talent, breaking the US constant weight record shortly after beginning competitive freedive in 2012,' the release said.

The talented waterman also placed first at a Deja Blue competition earlier this year in Curacao, as well as took second in competitions in Honduras and Greece, AIDA noted.

He also held a handful of other free-diving records, according to a IFDC organizer.

Mr Mevoli's lack of experience almost killed him last year, he wrote a blog post titled 'How I Got to 91 meters.'

After reaching a depth of 88 meters, Mr Mevoli 'felt the effects of nitrogen narcosis at depth and at the same time realized that it was a long way up,' he wrote.

He panicked and raced to the surface, which put him at an even greater risk for death, he soon 'had to be rescued at 28m, nearly 100 feet, blacked out and experienced a major lung squeeze.'

'You canâ€™t lie to water,' Mr Mevoli wrote the episode taught him.

'Never lie to the water because you are only lying to yourself... come to the water willing to be consumed by it but also have confidence that your ability will bring you back.'
