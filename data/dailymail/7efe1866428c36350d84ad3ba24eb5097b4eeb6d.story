The 26-year-old husband of Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is to run for Congress, it was revealed today.

Sean Eldridge, a Democrat activist who heads an investment firm, filed the papers on Tuesday to challenge the Republican seat in New York's Hudson Valley.

The district is currently held by Representative Chris Gibson - a two-term Republican and decorated war hero.

Gibson was re-elected at the November elections winning 53 per cent of the vote. 

Eldridge and Hughes, who has a fortune of an estimated $500million, have positioned themselves as something of a gay power couple since tying the knot last year. 

Facebook co-founder, Mr Hughes, 28, married Mr Eldridge, then 25, last July at the couple's $5 million estate in Garrison, New York. The wedding was attended by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife Priscilla Chan.

Along with Mr Zuckerberg, whose presence was leaked by insiders, guests including Ivanka Trump, Arianna Huffington and Senator Chuck Schumer partied into the night.

Mr Hughes, who bought a majority stake in The New Republic last April appointing himself publisher and editor-in-chief, and his new husband, have emerged as a significant force in New York's political circles.

The pair are keen fund-raisers for progressive issues including gay rights and have held several events at the $5 million 4,000-square-foot loft they own in Crosby Street in SoHo.

Last year, the young men hosted a reception for New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, attending by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who, according to Twitter, was getting down to 'All The Single Ladies' by Beyoncé at their wedding.

'In a short period of time, Sean and Chris have had a big impact on the political life of New York,' Richard Socarides, a Democratic political strategist and former White House aide during the Clinton administration, previously told The Times.
