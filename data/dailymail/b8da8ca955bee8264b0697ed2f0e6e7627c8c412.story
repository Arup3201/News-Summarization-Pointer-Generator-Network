After 54-years, Federal scientists have said they have recovered one of the last bottle's set adrift by the government to track ocean currents.

Keith Moreis discovered the clear glass soda bottle containing a pink sheet that reads 'Break This Bottle' while walking in West Tisbury on Martha's Vineyard on December 22, 2013.

The bottle contained a postcard with a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey stamp dated September 19, 1959 with instructions on how to return it to authorities if found.

Recovered: This is the bottle found on the beach at Martha's Vineyard that was set adrift in an experiment more than 54-years ago

Keeping the bottle till February 20, Moreis was able to remove the stopper - thereby ensuring that the bottle remained intact.

He took it to the Woods Hole Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who explained to Moreis that the bottle was the last of series of bottles released between 1958 and 1966 to chart ocean currents.

Drift bottles have been in use to track ocean currents since 1846. 

'The postcard had both stamped and handwritten information on the top: U.S.C.&G.S. HYDROGRAPHER was stamped on the left corner, and September 19, 1959 on the right corner, with the day handwritten.

'In the middle, just above the printed words “FINDER OF THIS BOTTLE” and instructions below, was the handwritten number 279B, written twice,' said a report in the Northeast Fisheries Science Center.

Experiment: It is probable that it was launched from either the vessel Explorer or Pathfinder in the 1950's or 1960's. It is remarkable that the bottle survived for close to fifty years.

Historic: These are the leaflets left inside the bottle set adrift more than 50-years ago in New England

More than 50-years floating: While the NOAA do not know the precise movements of the bottle - they know it was set adrift from Nomans Land in 1959 and washed up at West Tisbury in 2013

USCGS refers to the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, which was created in 1807 as the Survey of the Coast and expanded as the United State expanded westward.

The agency was renamed in 1878 and is currently part of NOAA.

Archived documents revealed that in September and October of 1959, the USC&GS Ship Hydrographer conducted environmental studies in three areas off the New England Coast: 16 miles northeast of Cape Cod Light, just south of Nomans Land, and 36 miles south of Gay Head on Martha’s Vineyard.

Records from March 1960 indicated that four of the six bottles numbered 279B released south of Nomans Land were recovered within two months of their September 19, 1959 release.

Another one after 2 days, another after 4 days, and a third after 7 days. All three were found on Martha’s Vineyard. The fourth was found after 55 days on Nantucket.

This means that the December 2013 bottle is one of the last two bottles dropped into the sea from those six.

But, just like the others it was recovered near to where it was released - in this case more than 54-years later.

'Finding the bottle was exciting,' Moreis told the Northeast Fisheries Science Center.

'Learning more about it and its history has been a rewarding experience, to say the least. I never expected to find something like this, but then again, you never know what you will find on the beach.'
