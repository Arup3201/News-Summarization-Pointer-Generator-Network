A man who gave an emotional interview after the disappearance of his friend was 'spotted on camera walking with her into deserted garage and driving out in his car despite insisting he was parked somewhere else.'

Plano, Texas Police say that Enrique Arochi, the last person seen with Christina Morris before she disappeared on August 30, made many false statements over the course of the investigation.

'Arochi has made numerous false statements and omitted pertinent information to Affiant during the course of the investigation into Morris’ disappearance,' Plano Detective Cathy Stamm wrote in the affidavit for the search warrant, reports Dallas News.

Made false statements: Enrique Arochi said that he was parked in a different garage than Christina Morris on the night that she disappeared but surveillance footage shows him driving his car out of the same garage  

Missing: Christina Morris disappeared on the morning of August 20 and was last seen with Enrique Aroche 

'Affiant believes Arochi has intentionally made false statements which have hindered detectives in locating Morris.'

One such claim was that Arochi parked his car in a different garage than Morris.

Surveillance footage shows him walking with Morris and later shows him pulling his car out of the garage at 3:58 a.m.

When police showed Arochi the footage of him driving away he said, 'I must have parked there.'

'The inconsistency was where I parked because both parking lots look exactly identical,' Arochi told KRLD 1080.

'And I don’t have a sense of direction so I didn’t really know where I parked'.

Under investigation: Plano police has since investigated Arochi's car looking for fluids, hair, and DNA evidence in connection to Christina Morris' disappearance but haven't yet reported their findings

Missing: Christina Morris has been missing since August 20th and was last seen with Enrique Arochi who has told police many different versions of his story

CBS reports that while Arochi says that Morris was never in his car, police believe she may have been inside when he was pulling away from the garage in the early hours of the morning on August 30.

'So we walked and we split and after I saw my car, I went to my car. I don’t know where she went, or if she went to her car. I just went to my car and left.'

'I honestly didn’t see anything. I was just walking to my car,' said Arochi in an exclusive interview with CBS.

Plano police has since investigated Arochi's car looking for fluids, hair, and DNA evidence but haven't yet reported their findings.

According to a warrant, police say they also have video of Arochi examining strange parts of his car at a grocery store in Allen just hours after Morris' disappearance.

Also following the disappearance, Arochi had 'bruising to his right forearm' and 'abrasions to his right hand.'

Protests: Christina Morris' supporters have protested outside of Enrique Arochi's home with signs reading 'tell us the truth Enrique' in the hopes he will divulge more information

Disbelief: Christina Morris' mother, Jonni McElroy, says she doesn't understand how Enrique Arochi doesn't have any more information about her daughter's disappearance since he was with her just hours before 

He told police that he punched his car fender but police took pictures of the vehicle and the damage didn’t match Arochi’s description.

A co-worker of Arochi's told investigators that the day after Morris' disappearance, Arochi looked like s**t, was walking with a limp, and supposedly had bite marks on his arm.

Arochi told his co-worker he was in a fight the night before but that story changed as well.

He says his injuries have nothing to do with Morris' disappearance and says that he had an accident that day changing his tire.

'I didn’t have any bite marks on my arm, I had an accident that day changing my tire – and there’s proof of that cause I texted my girlfriend telling her I was changing my tires and that’s been cleared,' said Arochi.

Arochi has admitted to police that the night of Morris' disappearance; he had taken Adderall and consumes 10 shots of liquor and 3-5 beers.

Another one of Arochi's false statements was that he says he didn't contact Morris' boyfriend Hunter Foster the night she disappeared.

Police say that Arochi's phone shows him making calls and texts to Foster at 3:50, 3:53, and 3:55 the morning she disappeared.

Despite Arochi's holes in his story, he has stood by his innocence. 

Morris' mother wants to know where her daughter is and she believes that Arochi has the answers.

'I feel like the one person that walked her to the parking garage has to know something,' Jonni McElroy, Morris’s mother, told CBS 11 News.

Arochi says he hasn't spoken with Morris' mother despite protestors standing outside his home with signs reading, 'tell us the truth Enrique.'

Arochi still says he has nothing to do with Morris and said,'I had nothing to do with her disappearance,” said Arochi.

'I just want them to come forward. It’s not only affecting her family, it’s affecting a lot of people around us. It’s just not fair if someone’s holding onto that piece of information that may lead to where Christina may be. I just want them to be honest and come forward.'

Arochi says he has been told by Plano police that he is not a suspect but that he is only a person of interest.
