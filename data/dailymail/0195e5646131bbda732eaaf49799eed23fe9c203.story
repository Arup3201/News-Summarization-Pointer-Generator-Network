Andy Murray's new coach Amelie Mauresmo looked tense as she watched his first match under her charge at Queen's.

Despite Murray easing his way to a comfortable straight sets win over Paul-Henri Mathieu, his 34-year-old coach pulled a range of facial expressions and at one point held her head in her hands.

Ms Mauresmo, herself a former Wimbledon champion, was in the front row for Murray's victory  in the Aegon Championships at Queen's Club, London, a few seats down from his girlfriend Kim Sears.

Stressed? Despite Murray easing his way to a comfortable straight sets win over Paul-Henri Mathieu, his 34-year-old coach pulled a range of facial expressions and at one point held her head in her hands

In the hot seat: Mauresmo, herself a former Wimbledon champion, was in the front row for Murray's victory in the Aegon Championships at Queen's Club, London

Murray won his match against Mathieu with a comfortable 6-4 6-4 victory, as he returned to action on a grass court ahead of Wimbledon later this month.

Mauresmo won the women's singles title at
 SW19 in 2006 and as a grass court specialist is seen as the ideal coach
 to help Murray retain the Wimbledon crown he memorably won last year 
after defeating Novak Djokovic.

Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears seemed more relaxed than her boyfriend's new coach as she arrived to watch the game.

Audience: Andrew Murray's new coach former French tennis player Amelie Mauresmo (far right) with his grilfriend Kim Sears (far left) and the rest of his coaching team watching him play Paul-Henri Mathieu

Seating plan: Kim was seated a few seats down from Murray's new coach as she watched his match from the front row at Queen's

Miss Sears, Murray's girlfriend of eight years, grinned widely as she made her way to her seat to watch the 27-year-old's  returned to action after a crushing defeat in the semi-finals of the French Open to Rafael Nadal.

Dressed
 casually in a denim jacket and floral dress, carrying an over-sized 
pale blue handbag, 26-year-old smiled as she greeted her fellow 
spectators.

Both she and Mauresmo were in the front row of the stadium with the rest of Murray's 
coaching team as they watched the Scot ease to victory as he started his
 bid to retain his Queen's title.

All smiles: Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears appeared happy with Andy Murray's new choice of coach as she arrived to watch his first match since working with Amelie Mauresmo

Arrival: Dressed casually in a denim jacket, and carrying her stylish Aspinal Marylebone Tote (Pippa Middleton and Millie Mackintosh have one too), the 26-year-old smiled as she greeted fellow spectators

Spectator: Kim took her usual place in the stands along with Mauresmo and the rest of Murray's team as the 27-year-old began his bid to retain his Queen's title

Prime position: Kim seemed keen to get to her seat for her boyfriend's first match under the tutelage of former Wimbledon champion Ms Mauresmo

Watching the match, Kim shielded her eyes from the June sunshine with a pair of sunglasses, and also sported a 'Rally For Bally' bracelet in memory of former British women's' number one Elena Baltacha, who died last month at the age of 30.

As Murray practiced this morning with
 his new coach, she already appeared to be sharing her insight and 
experience with the Scot, having observed him practice his serving and 
general play from a few meters back before handing out a tip or two 
during a drinks break.

Her appointment had come as a surprise to many, replacing Ivan Lendl as Murray's coach after the Czech split from the British No. 1 in March following a successful two-year partnership.

Mauresmo enjoyed her own glittering 15-year playing which ended in 2009
 - with her best year coming in 2006 where she won Wimbledon and the 
Australian Open - her only slam victories.

Summer time: Kim removed her denim jacket as she watched the action unfold on the court

At
 SW19, Mauresmo's victory came off the back of serve and volley 
tennis and it's this expertise that has drawn Murray to appoint the 
Frenchwoman as his coach.

Aside
 from slam victories, she became the first French player to become World
 No. 1 in 2004 - despite having not won a major - and went on to gain a 
silver medal at the Athens Olympics.

It wasn't just Mauresmo's on court actions that received attention throughout the years.

The
 Frenchwoman came out as a lesbian at just 19 years old in 1999, a move 
which she admitted later was tough and led to jibes from fellow 
professionals Lindsey Davenport and Martina Hingis.

Comeback: Murray returned to action at Queen's today after a crushing defeat in the semi-finals of the French Open to Rafael Nadal

Defence: Murray and his team will be hoping his victory today will stand him in good stead as he battles to retain his Queen's and Wimbledon titles

Watchful eye: Mauresmo's appointment had come as a surprise to many, replacing Ivan Lendl as Murray's coach after the Czech split from the British No. 1 in March following a successful two-year partnership

Expert: Mauresmo enjoyed her own glittering 15-year playing which ended in 2009 - with her best year coming in 2006 where she won Wimbledon and the Australian Open - her only slam victories

However,
Mauresmo also claims that coming to terms with her sexuality was a 
vital part of her success on the court, a success that would transfer to
 coaching.

Mauresmo made 
her first entrance into coaching in 2010, guiding Michael Llodra, before
 then teaming up with then World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka two years 
later.

Her most notable 
coaching success came last year, in helping guide Marion Bartoli to the 
2013 Wimbledon crown. It was Bartoli's first grand slam victory and it 
came without dropping a set.
