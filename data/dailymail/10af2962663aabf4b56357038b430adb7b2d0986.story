Prince Andrew’s former friend Jeffrey Epstein intimidated a pregnant journalist by asking where she was due to give birth, it was claimed yesterday .

British-born writer Vicky Ward was so afraid of the American financier that she had security put on the intensive care ward where her premature twins were being treated.

The Cambridge-educated journalist also described how Epstein, 61, showed off his intimacy with the 54-year-old prince by introducing him to friends as ‘Andy’.

Miss Ward, 45, said the billionaire paedophile tried both to charm her and to ‘control’ her when he learned she was writing an in-depth article about him in 2002.

He got a female assistant to ring her up and tell her that he thought she looked ‘so pretty’ after their first meeting. 

But his attentions quickly turned more sinister as she delved deeper into the mystery of where he made his money and his taste for young women.

Epstein rang her regularly, asking her about the ‘nature’ of the story she was going to write for Vanity Fair magazine.

Miss Ward said he seemed ‘almost unconcerned’ about alleged financial irregularities she had uncovered, but repeatedly demanded to know: ‘What do you have on the girls?’

No comment: Zara Phillips fends off question about her uncle, the Duke of York

His ex-wife may have come out fighting on his behalf, but the Duke of York’s niece, Zara Phillips, refused to talk about him yesterday.

The Olympic silver medallist is in Australia with her daughter, Mia, to publicise a race meeting.

She was asked about the scandal engulfing Prince Andrew during a question-and-answer session with media on Queensland’s Gold Coast.

An unidentified male journalist asked Princess Anne’s daughter: ‘How is your uncle faring in the wake of all these allegations?’

Zara, who clearly didn’t expect the question, swiftly replied: ‘I’m not going to answer that.’

Zara, who has had extensive media training in her role as a professional sportswoman, took the question in her stride – but it was a sign of the growing pressure the Royal Family is under over the claims, which are fiercely denied, that Prince Andrew slept with an under-age ‘sex slave’ at parties held by paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Event organisers looked horrified as Zara was asked the question. She is reportedly being paid a ‘small fortune’ to be an ambassador for the Magic Million event.

Earlier this week the Duchess of York, who was on holiday with Andrew when the US court papers were lodged, spoke out in his defence.

‘He is the greatest man there is,’ she said.

The journalist tracked down two sisters from Phoenix, Arizona, who told her that the wealthy sex offender had tried to seduce them.

Epstein allegedly molested the younger girl, who was then only 16, after promising to pay for her to travel abroad to get work experience that would help her get a place at a top US university.

The girls’ mother told Miss Ward that she had feared that her daughters would be harmed after their ordeal.

‘The thing that frightened me was that he would know where they lived and could possibly just send somebody when they walk the dog at night or something around the corner, and we’d never hear from them again,’ the mother said.

When Epstein found out what the journalist had been told, he called her and Vanity Fair’s editor Graydon Carter and tried to get the girls’ claims removed from the article.

Miss Ward reported that the financier told her: ‘Just the mention of a 16-year-old girl … carries the wrong impression. I don’t see what it adds to the piece. And that makes me unhappy.’ 

Mr Carter also received letters which claimed to be written by the sisters and their mother, but which the women insisted were fakes.

Describing how Epstein ‘spooked’ her, the writer recalled how he got past security to enter her offices.

When her twins were born dangerously prematurely, she was worried for their safety because the financier had asked at which hospital she was giving birth.

Writing for the Daily Beast online news website, Miss Ward said: ‘I was so afraid that somehow, with all his connections to the academic and medical community, that he was coming for my little ones that I put security on them in the NICU [neonatal intensive care unit].

‘When they’d been released home some months later, I went out to my first party. There was Jeffrey Epstein, sucking a lollipop. “Vicky,” he said, “you look so pretty”.’ 

In the end Vanity Fair’s editor decided not to include the girls’ claims that Epstein tried to seduce them because he had denied the allegations and they were ‘unsubstantiated’. 

Miss Ward wrote: ‘It has often struck me that if my piece had named the women, the FBI might have come after Epstein sooner and perhaps some of his victims, now, in the latest spate of allegations, allegedly either paid off or too fearful of retribution to speak up, would have been saved.’ 

Her original article, published in March 2003, referred to a cocktail party attended by Epstein and Prince Andrew that was filled with ‘young Russian models’.
