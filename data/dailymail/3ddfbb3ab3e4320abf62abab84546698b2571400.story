Admission: Anna Dugdale, head of Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital said she would not want her own mother to be treated there

The head of a £229m flagship hospital in crisis has shockingly revealed that she would not allow her own mother to be treated there.

Anna Dugdale spoke out today as Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital reaches breaking point due to a catastrophic rise in patients.

Ms Dugdale said that drastic bed shortages at the 13-year-old hospital had forced them to use makeshift wards in a desperate bid to cope with a flood of admissions. 

The crisis is getting worse all the time because the rural region has a growing, ageing population and patients are staying in hospital longer.

Coupled with a rise in A&E admissions - which have rocketed from 54,000 in 2008-09 to 68,000 this year - exhausted staff are said to be under immense pressure.

Ms Dugdale, hospital chief executive since 2008, admitted: 'I wouldn't choose this for my mum, but I wouldn't want her in the car park either.

'I would want her in the hospital.

'It's really tough for everybody. I do this job as I'm proud of what we do and I love it.

'We are not able to do everything we would like to do for every patient at the moment and that makes me very sad.

'Our ability to accommodate all our patients depends on how many people turn up and how many people we can get out of the back doors.'

Ms Dugdale said there were 'all sorts of options' but insisted that she would never turn patients away from her 953-bed hospital.

The huge level of demand for care has forced the use of non-ward areas for bed space - including makeshift wards in the medical school.

Operations have had to be cancelled due to the volume of new admissions.

And an increasing number of nursing staff are going off sick due to stress and sheer exhaustion - making the creaking hospital's staffing situation even worse.

Asked if they'd reached crisis point, Ms Dugdale said: 'Our bread and butter is dealing with crisis, so I would never say that, as that's what our clinicians are trained to deal with.

'But the pressure that the emergency teams are under does take its toll day in, day out.

'It's very hard, physically and emotionally. I'm always full of admiration for them.'

And she stressed: 'Absolutely something does need to be done now.'

A report, which went before the N&N trust board yesterday, (Fri), revealed the A&E four-hour target had been missed a number of times and two patients had to wait more than 12 hours in A&E.

Ms Dugdale said those two cases involved 'patients with complex needs'.

'It's a complex situation and what we've seen is people reduce the headroom. It just makes it really difficult to cope with.'

The number of A&E admissions has risen by 3.5% from April to August 2013 to the same period this year.

'The scale of the operational challenge is being felt throughout the hospital across clinical and administrative areas and most particularly among staff involved in the care of emergency patients,' the board report read.

'Sickness due to stress is high and the general level of sickness across the trust is up.'

Ms Dugdale said stress had been compounded as A&E admissions had climbed at the time of some ward moves - during a redecoration programme to maintain standards.

She said she did not know how long it would take to bring the 'extreme' pressure under control but that dedicated staff were doing all they could.
