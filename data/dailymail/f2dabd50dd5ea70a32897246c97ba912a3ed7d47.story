‘You're getting sacked in the morning,’ sang the Villa fans after Emmanuel Adebayor had scored Tottenham’s third goal from the penalty spot.

‘That’s a bit harsh,’ quipped Spurs boss Tim Sherwood. ‘We’re 3-0 up.’

The chant was aimed at Villa manager Paul Lambert, but it could have applied to either of the men standing in the dug outs at White Hart Lane.

Sherwood is certainly on borrowed time, with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy neglecting to mention his manager by name - let alone thank him - in his end-of-season address.

The 45-year-old was seemingly intent on enjoying his final game in charge, celebrating Paulinho’s opening goal with self-conscious aplomb and then giving fan Danny Grimsdale his gilet and inviting him to sit on the bench in the 84th minute.

Happy ending: Tottenham booked a place in Europe next season with a comfy win against Aston Villa

Comfortable: Tim Sherwood's future as Tottenham boss is in doubt but he finished the season in style

Close to the edge: After seeing his side well beaten again, Villa boss Paul Lambert could also be axed

Few others possessed Sherwood’s 
enthusiasm, however, as Tottenham cruised to victory through a Paulinho 
strike, a Nathan Baker own goal and then Adebayor’s penalty after a 
Gabby Agbonlahor handball.

But
 Sherwood had the last laugh too, guiding Spurs to sixth place and 
ensuring his successor will have to oversee Europa League football next 
season; an increasingly poisoned chalice for any club hoping to break 
into the Premier League’s top four.

He
 then proceeded to tell Levy to sack him or back him by extending the 
remaining year of his contract, and claimed it was ‘ridiculous’ 
Tottenham could have dreamt about finishing in the top four, let alone 
winning the title, this season. It was quite the farewell speech, all 
things considered.

‘There 
were no tears shed out there,’ added Sherwood. ‘This club means a lot to
 me but if I’m not to continue here as a manager I’ll be somewhere else.

‘It
 will be interesting to see what I’ve been judged on. If I’m to leave it
 can’t be on results. If I had started the season we would have been in 
the Champions League.’

Lambert’s
 position is also far from secure after a 15th-placed finish. Villa 
owner Randy Lerner is expected to announce plans to sell the club on Monday and the fans’ discontent with their manager was obvious.

‘We
 want our Villa back,’ they sang, clad in an array of fancy dress 
including a post box, traffic cones and Zippy and George from Rainbow. 
Bungle must have been on the pitch, so hopeless were their team, in the 
first half in particular.

‘I’m every bit as disappointed as they are,’ said Lambert. ‘It’s not nice to hear, but I understand everybody’s frustration.

‘The
 main thing for me is Aston Villa is a Premier League club. We’ve got 
Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City to play next season.

‘I intend to be (at the club’s awards dinner on Tuesday). I don’t want to pay £3 for a bow tie and not turn up.’

No luck: Nathan Baker scored an own goal to put Tottenham two goals in front against Aston Villa

Saltue: Emmanuel Adebayor scored Tottenham's third goal from the penalty spot           

Spot on: Adebayor scored from the spot after Gabriel Agbonlahor handled Sandro's shot

Kyle Walker was still not fit enough even to make the Tottenham bench against Aston Villa. The right back has not yet resumed training but was assessed by the England medical team last week and was at White Hart Lane on Sunday for the final game of the season.

His
 team did not turn up on Sunday though, as Spurs ran riot in the 
first 45 minutes and then both sides looked forward to their summer 
holidays.

Paulinho played a 
one-two with Harry Kane and slotted in the rebound after Brad Guzan 
saved his initial shot, then Baker diverted a Danny Rose cross into his 
own net under pressure from Adebayor. A fine block from Fabian Delph 
prevented Kane adding a third before Agbonlahor handled a Sandro shot in
 the penalty area. Adebayor slotted away the resulting spot-kick for his
 14th goal of the season.

A 
Michael Dawson header prompted a fine save from Guzan, but Villa’s 
chances were limited to long-range, off-target efforts by Delph and 
Ashley Westwood, bringing more ironic cheers from the away supporters.

It
 has been an underwhelming campaign for both these teams, but it is 
still not quite over yet. The chances of either Sherwood or Lambert 
being in charge when the Premier League resumes on August 16 are looking
 increasingly slim, after all.
