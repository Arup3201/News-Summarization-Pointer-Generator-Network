Medics have killed a woman by lethal injection because she could not cope with becoming blind.

In one of the first cases of euthanasia for a disability, the 70-year-old was deemed by doctors to be ‘suffering unbearably’.

They granted her wish to die after she had previously tried to commit suicide several times.

But pro-life campaigners said the case showed how euthanasia and assisted suicide for more trivial reasons can soon become the ‘norm’ in countries where it is legal.

They insisted it was medical negligence for the doctors in Holland to have gone along with the woman’s suicidal ideas and said they should have found a way to manage her psychological problems.

The unnamed woman had been born with poor eyesight which had deteriorated into blindness as she entered old age.

She had lived alone since her husband died.

Health specialist Lia Bruin told a Dutch newspaper that the case was ‘exceptional’.

‘She was, for example, obsessed by cleanliness and could not stand being unable to see spots on her clothes,’ Bruin said.

In neighbouring Belgium, deaf twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, were granted their wish to be killed last December after they learned they were likely to become blind.

Anthony Ozimic of anti-euthanasia lobbyists SPUC Pro-Life, said the cases illustrated the dangers that would threaten vulnerable people in Britain if Lord Falconer’s assisted suicide bill became law.

A lethal injection kit: In Holland, the patient must also be able to make a conscious and autonomous decision about ending their lives by lethal injection

Holland became the first country in 
the world since Nazi Germany to legalise euthanasia when in 2002 it 
approved doctor-administered lethal drugs for terminally ill people 
facing unbearable suffering.

Two
 doctors must first decide that the patient is afflicted by ‘unbearable 
suffering’ from which he or she has no realistic prospect of recovery.

The patient must also be able to make a conscious and autonomous decision about ending their lives by lethal injection.

The woman’s death comes just weeks 
after it emerged that deaths by euthanasia have hit a record high in 
Holland, with nearly one in seven people now dying at the hands of their
 doctors.

Euthanasia cases 
soared by 13 per cent in 2012 - 4,188 deaths compared to 3,695 deaths – 
meaning that it accounts for about one in 30 of all deaths, boosted 
possibly by mobile death units launched last year to kill sick and elderly 
people in their own homes when a family doctor objects on ‘ethical’ 
grounds.

But the figures did not take account 
of deaths by terminal sedation, by which patients are deliberately 
sedated before they are dehydrated and starved to death, an act often 
referred to as ‘euthanasia by omission’.

Euthanasia cases soared by 13 per cent in 2012 to 4,188 – meaning that it accounts for about one in 30 of all deaths.

However, the figures did not take 
account of deaths by ‘terminal sedation', by which patients are 
deliberately sedated before they are dehydrated and starved to death, an
 act often referred to as ‘euthanasia by omission’.

This practice accounts for more than 
12 per cent of all deaths, lifting the overall euthanasia rate to 15 per
 cent – about one in seven of all deaths.

The overall figure may even by higher if an accepted phenomenon of underreporting is also taken into consideration.

Dr Peter Saunders of the Christian Medical Fellowship said: ‘Euthanasia in the Netherlands is way out of control.

‘The House of Lords calculated in 2005 that with a Dutch-type law in Britain we would be seeing over 13,000 cases of euthanasia per year.

'On the basis of how Dutch euthanasia deaths have risen since this may prove to be a gross underestimate.’

Most euthanasia cases in Holland involve cancer patients but increasingly they have included dementia sufferers and psychiatric patients.

In 2005, the Groningen Protocol protected doctors from being prosecuted for the euthanasia of infants as long as they followed approved guidelines.

Euthanasia is carried out by administering a strong sedative to put the patient in a coma, followed by a drug to stop breathing and cause death.

Last year, Belgium, where euthanasia came into force in 2003, saw a 25 per cent increase in such deaths, leaping to 1,432 – a figure representing about 2 per cent of all deaths in the country.

Last month Belgian Nancy Verhelst, 44, was killed by euthanasia after doctors botched her sex change operation, leaving her with physical deformities she felt made her look like a ‘monster’.

This week the Belgian parliament will discuss proposals to extend euthanasia to children, dementia sufferers and people with long-term illnesses.

Assisted suicide – where a doctor will help a patient kill themselves – is also on the rise in countries where it is allowed.

Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world

In Washington State in America, assisted suicides increased by 17 per cent in 2012 to 83 cases.

Switzerland, which first relaxed prohibitions on assisted suicide in 1942, has seen a steady rise of assisted suicides of Swiss nationals from 43 in 1998 to 297 in 2009.

The figures do not include people from abroad who travel to Dignitas to commit suicide there.
