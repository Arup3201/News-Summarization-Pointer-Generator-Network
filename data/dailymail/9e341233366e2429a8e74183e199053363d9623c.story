She is the French, Oscar-winning actress who won hearts with her turn as Edith Piaf in Oliver Dahan's La Vie En Rose in 2007.

And now Marion Cotillard has beaten off stiff competition from the likes of Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham to be crowned best dressed star of 2013.

She may only ever be spotted on the red carpet or as the face of Dior’s handbag campaigns, but the 38-year-old won the nation's heart to take the top spot on Grazia's best dressed list 2013.

Winner! Marion Cotillard has been crowned Grazia magazine's best dressed star of 2013

The starlet, who has graced 170 magazine covers around the world, was voted in at number one by the British public.

Marion pipped boho babe, Kate Bosworth and immaculate Olivia Palermo to the top spot, who came in second and third place respectively.

As the face of Lady Dior handbags since 2008, Marion now wears an almost exclusively Dior wardrobe every time she makes a showstopping appearance.

Grazia Daily cite favourites as the canary yellow gown she donned at the Baftas - where, they say, she battled through the cold and rain and still managed to bring that coveted je ne sais quoi - and also in next season’s micro-striped midi at the recent Marrakech International Film Festival.

Other contenders to make the top ten include Rihanna, Alexa Chung, Kate Moss, Victoria Beckham, Miranda Kerr, Nicole Ritchie and Cara Delevingne.
