Dylan Adams, 26, the brother of murder suspect Zachary Adams was arrested on Wednesday after Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents accused him of tampering with evidence tied to the Holly Bobo investigation

The brother of a man accused of kidnapping and killing a 20-year-old nursing student has been charged with tampering with evidence in the case.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said in a news release Thursday that on April 13, 2011, the day Holly Bobo disappeared in West Tennessee, 26-year-old John Dylan Adams of Decatur County disposed of items he knew could be evidence in the case.

Adams is the brother of Zachary Adams. He was charged with murder in March and his family has property about 6 miles from where Bobo's remains were found by ginseng hunters this month.

Another man, Jason Autry, faces the same charges as Zachary Adams. Both men have pleaded not guilty.

The TBI said John Dylan Adams was in jail without bond.

The brother of murder suspect Zachary Adams was arrested on Wednesday after Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents accused him of tampering with evidence tied to the Holly Bobo investigation.

TBI agents believe that on April 13, 2011, John Dylan Adams disposed of items he knew to be of evidentiary value to the case, according to the release.

'Our investigation is by no means complete with this arrest and with this charge,' Jodh DeVine said.

'We're continuing to follow leads, continuing to work evidence and continuing to do everything we can to bring justice for the family and friends of Holly Bobo.'

District Attorney Matt Stowe said that the latest arrest is part of the ongoing effort to bring to justice everyone involved in Bobo's disappearance.

'Everything right now is part of our comprehensive plan to find everyone responsible in this case,' Stowe said.

On April 2, Zach Adams was charged with coercion of a witness. The warrant in that incident states Zach Adams asked an unnamed inmate to 'Tell my brother he is the one who started this (expletive), and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her.'

Adams is tentatively scheduled to appear in court in Decatur County at 9 a.m. on Monday.

His
 criminal history shows charges dating back to 2009 including several 
drug violations as well as aggravated burglary and theft.

Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder.

He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. 

The
 case about Miss Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are 
considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction in the 
case.

Jason
 Wayne Autry, 39, has also been charged with especially aggravated 
kidnapping and first-degree felony murder in Bobo’s case.

Both he and Zachary Adams have pleaded not guilty.

Brothers
 Jeffrey Pearcy and Mark Pearcy were arrested in May and charged with 
tampering with evidence and accessory after the fact, after a woman 
named Sandra King told authorities that Jeffrey had showed her a cell 
phone video of Bobo tied up and crying.

In the wake of Miss Bobo's 
disappearance her brother told police that he saw a man dressed in 
camouflage leading her away into the woods.

She had been preparing to go to class at nursing school on the morning of her disappearance.

The
 director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) said the Bobo 
investigation has been the most expensive and exhaustive in TBI history,
 and it's not over yet.

Since
 she disappeared, the small town of Parsons and surrounding areas in 
West Tennessee tried to support the family, putting up pink ribbons on 
lamp posts, mailboxes and storefronts. Miss Bobo was wearing a pink 
shirt and carrying a pink purse before she disappeared.

Two
 men found a skull earlier this month Sunday not far from property owned by the family of 
Zachary Adams, who has been charged with Bobo's kidnapping and murder.

He has pleaded not guilty. The area near his family's property was searched in March.  

Another man facing murder and kidnapping charges, Jason Autry, also has pleaded not guilty.

Recently
 elected District Attorney Matt Stowe said his office was preparing to 
seek a possible death penalty in the case. A decision is expected in 
coming weeks, after he consults with the Bobo family, he said.

'The
 evidence is voluminous,' Stowe said. 'We are going to make sure that 
everyone who played a part in the heinous crime that has attacked the 
peace and dignity of the state of Tennessee faces a consequence for 
that.'

In
 May, brothers Jeffrey Pearcy and Mark Pearcy were both charged 
with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence. Like Autry and Adams, they have pleaded not guilty.

TBI
 director Mark Gwyn previously said the agency has sworn statements from
 witnesses who claim to have seen Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after 
she had been reported missing.

Gwynn added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses.

'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5.

'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.'

He
 added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to 
solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will
 prevail.' 

'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added.
