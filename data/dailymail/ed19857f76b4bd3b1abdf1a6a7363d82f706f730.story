The Chinese police chief who exposed the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood and then tried to defect to the US, has avoided the death penalty in China.

The Intermediate Court in the central city of Chengdu did not issue a verdict following the two half-day sessions in which it heard charges that Wang Lijun tried to defect, abused his power, took bribes and ignored the laws.

Wang's lawyer declined to comment other than to confirm the trial had concluded.

Verdict: Former police chief Wang Lijun facing the court during his trial in Chengdu, in southwest China's Sichuan province

On the bribery charge, prosecutors said Wang had improperly accepted 3.05 million renminbi, which equates to £300,000 ($484,127.)

The most explosive charges against 
Wang - defection and abuse of power - were heard in a closed-door 
hearing.

They were connected to his unexpected visit to the U.S. consulate 
in Chengdu in February, during which he handed over sensitive information 
about Heywood’s grisly death to U.S. consulate officials.

His dramatic flight for freedom lead 
to the downfall of powerful politician Bo Xilai and the conviction of 
Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, who was last month handed a suspended death 
sentence for poisoning 41-year-old Heywood over a business dispute.

Wang later 
turned himself in and provided information to investigators that led to a
murder conviction against Heywood's business associate Gu Kailai, the 
wife of Chongqing Communist Party chief Bo Xilai.

She received a suspended death sentence. 

The trial summary briefly described 
Wang's role in covering up the murder last year, saying that he 'knew 
perfectly well' that Gu was under 'serious suspicion' for the crime all 
along.

It said that 
although he helped cover it up, both the prosecutors and defense lawyers
told the court that he later cooperated with authorities.

The scandal has thrown the ruling Communist Party’s carefully choreographed once-in-decade power transition into disarray.

Wang, 52, is the former mafia-busting cop and right hand man of popular party secretary Bo Xilai.

The pair ruled with an iron fist over the western Chinese mega city of Chongqing and enjoyed national fame together.

But
their relationship imploded late last year after the death of Heywood 
and the erratic behaviour of Bo’s wife Gu, who with the help of her 
orderly killed the Briton with a cyanide-laced drink following a 
business dispute.

Prosecutors in her trial claimed she conferred with Wang before murdering Heywood and reported back to him afterwards.

Wang then fled with details of the murder and pleaded for protection from the US after falling out with Bo earlier this year.

But
he was persuaded after 30 hours of what was fast becoming an 
embarrassing diplomatic dispute to hand himself over to Chinese armed 
police who had surrounded the consulate.

British
officials have been criticised for not acting sooner on the information
handed to them by the US about Wang’s murder file.

'We made every effort to establish whether additional information existed,'  a spokesman for the British Embassy said.

What is certain is that Heywood’s murder would likely never have been investigated had Wang not fled to the US consulate and Bo Xilai would still be in line for a seat on China's most powerful political body, the standing committee of the Politburo.

Wang's trial clears the way for the leadership to deal with the scandal's stickiest issue: whether to expel Bo from the party and prosecute him.

China's leaders appear to still be in damage-control mode, and they have yet to announce a date for a party congress to install the new leadership, though it is expected in mid to late October.
