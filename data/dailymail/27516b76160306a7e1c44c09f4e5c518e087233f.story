Kate Moss has graced the cover of Vogue 33 times but now she's going behind the scenes by becoming a contributing fashion editor for the magazine.

British Vogue announced today that the 39-year-old model will be a 'hands-on editor', making her debut in the role in a forthcoming Spring issue.

She'll bring her decades of experience in the industry to fashion shoots and 'work with her choice of photographers and models'.

New role: Kate Moss, pictured earlier this month at an anniversary party for Rimmel, is joining Vogue's editorial team

The magazine's editor, Alexandra Shulman, said: 'I am absolutely delighted that Kate 
is going to work with us in this new role.

'Her 
undoubtedly brilliant sense of style, depth of fashion knowledge and 
understanding of what makes a wonderful image will be exciting to see on
the pages of British Vogue. I am really looking forward to working with
her on ideas.'

Natural career development: The model will bring her years of experience on fashion shoots to her role

Sarah Doukas, founder of Storm Models who have represent Moss, added: 'We are absolutely thrilled at Kate's appointment.

'This is a natural development in her remarkable career. Bringing her unique sense of style and  creative sensibility to Vogue is the perfect fit. She is the definitive Vogue cover girl.'

The editorial role adds another string to Moss's bow after it was also announced this month that she will once again collaborate with Topshop.

The Croydon-born model last worked with the High Street brand between 2007-2010 and will now design a new collection to be sold in 40 countries in 2014.

She told WWD: 'I have really missed being involved in the design process, and working with the team at Topshop. Now more than ever, with London being at the forefront of fashion it feels like I'm back home working with Topshop.'

Other on-going projects for the mother-of-one, who is married to Jamie Hince, include being a 'beauty ambassador' for cosmetics giant Rimmel, a designer of phone accessories for Carphone Warehouse and the face of luxury handbag brand Longchamp.
