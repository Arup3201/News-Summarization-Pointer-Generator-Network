All-rounder Chris Jordan has admitted his England team-mates have been left 'gutted' by their early World Cup exit.

England have lost four of their five games, and have rarely been competitive, with Monday's 15-run defeat to Bangladesh sending them crashing out at the group stage.

'Everyone is gutted. Gutted for the fans that came over and the fans at home watching,' Jordan said.

'There was probably a bit of anger inside some people (in the dressing room after the game), thinking about every single moment in the game that could have affected it - could they have done something different? That's only natural.'

So premature has been England's demise that their hopes of qualification have ended even before their final group game against Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday.

The match looms as a potential banana skin for a team low on confidence and who know that a long plane journey home will follow where the recriminations have already begun.

'Because of that result you want to get back on the horse quite quickly and try to put in a performance that rectifies what we did the other night,' Jordan said.

'That's the only way to deal with it at the minute.

'Friday is just an opportunity first of all to put that right and just put in a good performance for England.'

England will be without all-rounders Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali after they were ruled out with injuries suffered against Bangladesh.

Woakes left the Adelaide Oval with a protective boot on his left foot after first feeling the problem as he hit an unbeaten 42. Moeen suffered his problem while bowling and while he was able to continue on he will not play in Sydney.

'Scans (on Wednesday) revealed Chris Woakes has a left third metatarsal stress reaction and Moeen Ali has a left sided abdominal strain,' an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) spokeswoman said.

'Both players have been ruled out of the match against Afghanistan on Friday and will be reassessed when the team returns to the UK.'

England are due to name their squad for the Test tour of the Caribbean on Tuesday and both players could now be in some doubt.

That would come as a blow to coach Peter Moores, who will hope to take a full-strength to the West Indies as pressure mounts on his job following the World Cup debacle.

ECB managing director Paul Downton has already confirmed a major review will be conducted into England's failings Down Under and he himself has come under some pressure to keep his job, while senior players such as James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ian Bell might have reason to feel uneasy with suggestions England's embarrassment may prompt a clear-out for younger players.

Jordan is the type of player who might expect to be immune to such a cull and the 26-year-old admits he intends to use the pain of his first World Cup to make sure England do not repeat the same mistakes when they host the tournament in four years' time.

'We've had a few lows and you can only draw on these experiences in the future to make you stronger and to motivate you to get up every morning, to get your body in order and get your game in order,' he said.

'If I'm still around in four years' time hopefully I'll be somewhere close to the finished article and making sure days like the other day don't happen again.'

Jordan dismissed suggestions that major changes now need to be made if England are to catch up with the best sides in the world.

'I don't think so. There's loads of talent not just in that dressing room but in the whole of England,' he said.

'We've beaten some good teams in the past and we will beat good teams in the future. I don't think there needs to be wholesale changes.

'I can't put my finger on what exactly went wrong but hopefully in the future it won't happen again and we can put that right.'

The Sussex all-rounder was also supportive of Moores, who has already been given backing from Downton to remain in charge ahead of the Test tour of the Caribbean next month.

'Pete has done a brilliant job,' he said.

'He comes in with enthusiasm every day and gets the boys up for training, gets the boys up for games. It's just a bit disappointing that us as players didn't put in the performance we should have done. That's all I can say really.'

England will play their first-ever one-day international against Afghanistan, who did not have a national team until 2001.

The Asian nation's rapid rise has been one of the feel-good stories of this World Cup and, after securing a maiden win at the tournament in a thrilling contest against Scotland, they will bid to finish their campaign by knocking over England.

'They don't have anything to lose,' Jordan said.

'We have footage on every single player. It's not a game we will be taking lightly at all. We will be preparing thoroughly and looking for weaknesses to attack them.'

Bell also missed England's training session on Wednesday, but is expected to be fit to play after falling on a ball while fielding in Adelaide.
