If reports of giant rats across Europe weren't enough, new figures state they're not only getting larger, their numbers are increasing rapidly.

Scientists believe a rise in global rodent numbers is on the way - and with it a rise in the diseases they carry.

The increase in rat populations is being directly linked to a decline in large wildlife, meaning rats have better access to food and shelter. 

In the Middle Ages, fleas carried by rats were responsible for spreading the Black Plague. Today in East Africa, they remain important carriers of plague and many other diseases, including Bartonellosis, a potentially dangerous human pathogen which can cause spleen and liver damage and memory loss

A study by Hillary Young, assistant professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, looked at the relationship between the loss of large wildlife - known as defaunation - and the risk of human disease.  

In this case, they analysed Bartonellosis - a group of bacterial pathogens which can cause spleen and liver damage, and memory loss. 

‘We were able to demonstrate that declines in large wildlife can cause an increase in the risk for diseases that are spread between animals and humans,’ said Professor Young. 

‘This spike in disease risk results from explosions in the number of rodents that benefit from the removal of the larger animals.’ 

Declining numbers of zebra, antelope and other big grazers cause rodent populations to rapidly increase, a new study has shown. Hillary Young and colleagues from the Kenya Long-Term Exclosure Experiment show that the rise in rodent population brings with it fleas and various diseases that can be passed on to humans

Inside specially-designed plots that excluded large animals, rodents doubled in number. More rodents meant more fleas, and genetic screens of these fleas revealed that they carried significantly numbers of disease-causing pathogens. Pictured is a male rat flea (Xenopsylla sarodes)

In the UK, a swarm of 'super rats' was recently spotted across the country.

Figures have revealed that in some regions the number of vermin has already surged by 50 per cent since April last year.  

And experts believe the rat population could soar from 80 million to 160 million by the end of the year. 

It comes after many local authorities have shelved free pest control for homes as they battle funding cuts.  

And in some towns, councils have reduced bin collections to just once a month - leaving mountains of rotting rubbish to lure in the creatures.  

It is feared some of these larger rats are becoming increasingly resistant to poison and are far more difficult to kill.   

The researchers discovered this effect by using powerful electric fences to experimentally exclude large species like elephants, giraffe and zebra from study plots in Kenya.  

Inside these plots, rodents doubled in number.

More rodents meant more fleas, and genetic screens of these fleas revealed that they carried significantly numbers of disease-causing pathogens.  

According to Professor Young, these rodent outbreaks and associated increases in disease risk may be exacerbating health problems in parts of Africa where diminishing wildlife populations are rife. 

‘This same effect, however, can occur almost anywhere, where there are large wildlife declines,’ Professor Young said.  

‘This phenomena that we call rodentation - the proliferation of rodents triggered by large wildlife loss - has been observed in sites around the world.’ 

Big animals have been becoming scarcer for at least 10,000 years.

But as well as access to better food and shelter due to their decline, there are other, more subtle, reasons for the increase in rat numbers.  

‘The heavy feet of big grazers trample everything underfoot,’ said Oxford University's Meredith Root-Bernstein, writing in the Conversation.

‘Their grazing also keeps the grass short. When these animals are around, rodents and other small mammals try not to get stepped on and hide from predators in the patches of long grass. 

‘Without the big grazers, the trampling is gone and the grass grows tall, and rodents thrive.’
