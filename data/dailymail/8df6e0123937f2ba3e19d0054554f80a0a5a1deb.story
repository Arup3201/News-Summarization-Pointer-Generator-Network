A leading New Zealand fashion designer has sent critics and fans on the warpath after staging a show featuring American Indian feather headdresses.

Dame Trelise Cooper has now issued a grovelling apology for featuring the spectacular headdresses in her show as part of New Zealand fashion week, admitting it was a mistake due to her ignorance.

Critics took to social media to pan the headdress feature as culturally obnoxious, one asking if it would now be in order to bind Dame Trelise's feet like the Chinese used to do to women in times gone by.

Cooper posted an apology on her Facebook page saying she genuinely respected all cultures

In an apology she posted on Facebook, the fashion guru said today that she genuinely respected and honoured all cultures, races and religions.

'It was never my intention to disrespect another culture.

'It is my hope that through my mistake and ignorance, like me, people now know and are aware of the sacredness of the head dress to Native Americans,' she wrote.

'To those who I have offended, I sincerely apologise.'

Cooper's apology received a mixed reaction among the hundreds of comments

The designer's Facebook page has exploded with comments opposed to the Indian theme.

'This is appallingly offensive cultural appropriation. I see you're deleting comments about this too. 

'Would love to see some accountability for this - you put it on the runway, you have to defend your poor choices,' Morgan Ashworth posted after Cooper's apology.

While other fashion fans didn't perceive the look as offensive and couldn't see what all of the fuss was about.

'This is getting ridiculous, did anyone ever b***h about the Indian dude from The Village People?? I love going to fancy dress parties as an Indian Chief and am looking forward to doing it again in the near future, just to p*** off the over-sensitive clowns that society seems to spew forth on a more than regular basis,' Paul Silva ranted. 

Moroni Saseve agreed saying: 'these people need to get over themselves. take a chill pill or a kit kat'.

However, The New Zealand Herald reported that among Dame Trelise's fiercest critics was Melbourne-based lawyer Di White who told the designer in a social media comment that 'Indian headdresses are not yours to wear.

'This is cultural appropriation and super offensive.'

Claiming that the show was an attempt to profit off people's hurt, Ms White delivered a further blow by declaring that she had long believed Dame Trelise to be 'the most boring, unimaginative fashion designer in NZ and cheap shots like this just prove it.'

Another critic, Rosie Wong, asked whether 'in protest, can we bind your feet like Chinese women did back in the day? Or is breaking your feet not hipster enough? I get so confused these days about what's hot and what's not.'

The Herald reported that Dame Trelise said that she had seen feather headdresses worn as a 'fun thing' on her travels in the US and Ibiza recently.

In her defence today, Fashion Week managing director Dame Pieter Stewart said on TV3s Firstline that Dame Trelise meant no offence with the garments.

'It was beautiful, to be honest,' she told the program.

'It's a beautiful culture.

'Designers draw their inspiration from all sorts of things and she drew her inspiration obviously from the Indian culture.'

It is not the first time Indian headdresses worn by models have created uproar.

The French fashion house Chanel raised controversy in December when it used headdresses and American lingerie company Victoria's Secret was forced to apologise after using the garments in 2012.
