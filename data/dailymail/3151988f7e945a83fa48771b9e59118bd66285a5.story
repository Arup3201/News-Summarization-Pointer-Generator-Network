For years the Nikon camera company has been synonymous with wildlife photography.

Stunning images of animals are used to promote its products, features on top wildlife photographers appear on its website and the firm even sponsors several global conservation projects.

So it may come as quite a shock to animal lovers to discover that the Japanese manufacturer also produces a rifle scope specifically designed to be used for big game hunting in Africa.

Nikon, a company known for its links to wildlife and conservation, also produce a rifle sight specifically designed for big game hunting in Africa

The 'Monarch African' gunsight which 
sells for around £170, is touted in their marketing literature as the 
'proven choice for dangerous big game hunting' and a great choice for 
anyone 'seeking their dangerous game adventure in the dark continent'.

Stefano Unterthiner, winner of the 
Wildlife Photographer of the year in 2008, himself a user of Nikon 
cameras has now condemned the firm for producing such a product.

He told the Independent: 'I've used Nikon since I was a young boy, fascinated by nature and wildlife.

'I always saw Nikon as a company close to nature, but I was wrong.

'I don't understand and can't agree 
with their support for trophy hunting, which sends out entirely the 
wrong message to global photographers who love nature.

'Wildlife needs protecting now more than even and I urge the company to end its support for trophy hunting.

Trophy hunting is big business in 
South Africa where it is classed as eco-tourism and brings in an 
estimated $100m to the country's economy.

Rich westerners pay large sums to shoot large wild animals including lions and other big game. But campaigners say it is not only immoral but has had a devastating effect on wildlife.

Lion populations have halved in the last 30 years and much of the blame has been pointed at trophy hunters.

Nikon were unable to provide a comment.
