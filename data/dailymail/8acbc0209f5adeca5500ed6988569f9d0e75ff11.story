At the very moment Jodhi Meares's drink-driving case was being heard in court her fashion label was posting pictures spruiking her designs on Tuesday.

Meares was a no-show at Waverley Local Court, where her lawyer asked for an adjournment and told registrar Paul West a crash investigator was examining her wrecked Range Rover, which ended up on its side after a crash in Bellevue Hill in June.

Police allege she recorded a blood alcohol level of .181, almost four times over the legal limit, after the incident. She is yet to enter a plea.

While the matter was being heard, her fashion label posted a picture of a model with flowers in his beard and The Upside, the name of her company, on his T-Shirt.

'Spring is almost here, next stop summer,' the message read.

Meares also posted a video, saying how she was in New York shooting her spring/summer collection.

At court, her lawyer, prominent Sydney solicitor Chris Murphy, applied for an adjournment while an expert looks at the vehicle.

'We have engaged an accident investigation service to take a full analysis of the vehicle and the scene,' he said.'The car's only a Range Rover, four to five years old. The wreck is being examined.'

Meares, 43, is charged with high range drink-driving, which Mr Murphy said would be 'short matter' when it was heard later this month.

He said police had dropped two charges against her, including driving while her licence was suspended.

Ms Meares, the ex-wife of billionaire Australian casino mogul James Packer and currently engaged to rocker Jon Stevens, was arrested in June after the accident in which she collided with parked cars in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

Jon Stevens was seen running errands for his fiancee Meares in the days after the accident while the former model kept her head down

At around 9.45pm on Saturday, June 21, she turned offÂ  New South Head Road into O'Sullivan St, Bellevue Hill.

Witnesses said the vehicle then jack-knifed and flipped on to its side and she had to be pulled from the wreckage.

The case was adjourned until August 20. Mr Murphy entered no plea on her behalf.
