Barbara Walters has indicated that Monica Lewinsky may have been in the mix as a potential host on her U.S. chat show The View.

Ms Walters, who famously interviewed the infamous former White House intern after the scandal with then-president Clinton, said it 'would have been possible' that Ms Lewinsky was approached about a job on The View.

The 84-year-old broadcast journalist hinted heavily that this would have been the case as she appeared as a guest on The Late Show With David Letterman.

Confidante: Barbara Walters' exclusive interview with Monica Lewinsky, whose explicit sexual affair with then-president Bill Clinton resulted in his impeachment, was seen by a record breaking 74million people

Ms Walters admitted to Letterman, that she had recently spoken Lewinsky after the Vanity Fair article.

Ms Walters, who is set to retire from 
television later this month, hinted that Lewinsky had been approached as
 a potential host for the all-woman daytime talk show.

'Would you ever have considered putting her on The View?' Letterman asked her.

'Erm,
 I won't tell you what we have done but it would have been possible. I 
don't think that's what she wanted,' Ms Walters replied.

'I think it would be great if she were on The View. I wouldn't expect it tomorrow.'

Guilty conscience: TV show host David Letterman has admitted that he feels bad about the way he and other media and entertainment personalities treated Monica Lewinsky following the scandal in the late 90s

Speaking out: Monica Lewinsky opened up about how her affair with President Clinton is still affecting her life in a self-penned Vanity Fair article this month

The 67-year-old host of The Late Show With David Letterman, said Lewinsky's recent essay in Vanity Fair had touched him.

In a self-penned article in the magazine, Ms Lewinsky, 40, explains that she still cannot get a job, 16 years after the news of her affair with then-president Clinton broke.

'I started to feel bad because myself 
and other people with shows like this made relentless jokes about the 
poor woman,’ Letterman told Barbara Walters on last night’s The Late 
Show.

'And she was a kid, she was 21, 22… I feel bad about my role in helping push the humiliation to the point of suffocation.’

Letterman, who recently announced he will retire in 2015, laughed at claims Walters would quit television.

'Maybe
 she can take my place,' Ms Walters said of the show she co-created. 'And 
now The View with Whoopi Goldberg and Monica Lewinsky.'

Ms Walters
 famously interviewed Ms Lewinsky, now 40, in 1999 for a broadcast that was
 seen by a then record breaking 74 million viewers.

As she appeared on his show, 
host David Letterman told Ms Walters that he still has a guilty 
concience over his behaviour in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Letterman admitted that he and others in the media may have crossed the line in their treatment of the young White House intern.

And in his introduction he branded the idea that Walters would leave TV as 'c***' as the chance of an interview with Lewinsky would prove too tempting.

'Monica Lewinsky has resurfaced. You would talk to her in a second,' he said.

'I just talked to her,' she said. 'I like Monica. And I felt that she's never had the chance to move on and I hope that she does.

Letterman said he regrets making such fun of the former White House intern over the years.

'President Clinton has been able to move on. Hilary Clinton may run for President. I wish them both well. Monica is still stuck in the humor of it and she is an intelligent and nice woman.

I asked her what she'd tell her children and she said, "Mommy made a big mistake". That's still haunting her.'
