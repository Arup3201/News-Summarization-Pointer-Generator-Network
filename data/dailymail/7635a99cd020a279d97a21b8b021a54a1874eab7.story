Sticking out his tongue and licking his lips these are the hilarious portraits showing a dog enjoying a treat of peanut butter. 

The images of eight-year-old Doberman Arnaque were snapped by his owner Catherin Arsenault and show him lapping up the attention in front of the camera.

The pet photographer from Quebec in Canada has been taking pictures of Arnaque since he was just a 10-week-old puppy.

And now she is determined to show off her pet's wild side to the rest of the world.

Ms Arsenault said: 'I received a new backdrop that I wanted to test in my studio and I've been doing tests with my dog since he was 10-weeks-old.

'When he sees my camera he knows he will have a lots of treats and he starts to salivate.

'To get those licking pictures I gave him peanut butter and just shot plenty of images.

'It was a surprise each time I looked at the picture on my camera - I couldn't stop laughing.

'When people look at those pictures they are surprised at first - they aren't pictures you see every day.

'Then they laugh and are intrigued. They don't understand how it is possible because they've probably never seen their own dog like this.

'People take their time to look at those tongue and mouth details and I am sure they think about it when they see their dog's tongue - it's very amusing to see.'

The 32-year-old first started taking pictures of Arnaque while studying for her degree in linguistics.

The self-taught photographer continues to take snaps of her beloved pet on a daily basis and is determined to show him off to the world. 

Ms Arsenault says that most people are surprised at first by the pictures of Aranque with most finding them funny to look at 

She added: 'I have a lots of ideas and trying new things gives me more ideas for new shoots.

'A year before I graduated I got my first dog and I bought a better camera and started practising with him - I haven't stopped since.

'Eight years on and he still loves to play the model and patiently wait for his treats. 

'It's been a great experience and I'm hoping to carry on for many years to come.'
