A 20-year-old Russian footballer has been shot dead while driving home in a region that has become the focus of Islamic militant activity.

Anzhi Makhachkala midfielder Gasan Magomedov was driving home last night when his car was pelted with machine-gun fire. He died while being taken to hospital. 

No arrests have been made and the motive is unclear, the club said in a statement.  

Gasan Magomedov, who played for Anzhi, was shot while driving in to his village in Dagestan last night

Anzhi sent 'deepest condolences' to the family of Magomedov, a player in the club's youth and reserve teams.

The club added: 'One thing can be said with confidence -  Magomedov could not have provoked anything like this in any way.'

There were no reports of any other casualties.

Anzhi chief executive Sergey Korablev said: 'We grieve together with everyone who was dear to Gasan.

'I hope the police quickly find the killers and they suffer just punishment.'

Makhachkala (pictured) is the main city in the Dagestan Republic in Russia - the region has become the focus of Islamist miltant activity with as many as 300 people from the area fighting reportedly fighting for ISIS

The footballer was shot in the region of Dagestan - where the club are based - and which has become the focus of Islamist militant activity in the North Caucasus.

As many as 300 people from Dagestan are fighting for ISIS and about ten returnees have been killed in Russian anti-terror operations, it has been reported. 

The North Caucasus region is the part of Russia that slopes up towards the main ridge of the Caucasus mountains, often considered the border between Europe and Asia. 

It is home to dozens of nationalities and languages and gun battles between rebels and Russian security forces are not uncommon. 

Anzhi challenged for the Russian Premier League title in recent years financed by billionaire owner Suleyman Kerimov. 

With his funding, the club spent eye-watering sums on star players such as former Brazilian player Roberto Carlos, Chelsea winger Willian and striker Samuel Eto'o who was reportedly paid around £350,000 a week. 

Under his ownership, the club twice reached Europe and played the likes of Liverpool. 

But when Mr Kerimov withdrew his backing, Anzhi were relegated to the second tier with the worst record in the whole of European football.  

In the past the club encouraged big-money stars like Willian (left) and Samuel Eto'o (right) to sign for the club
