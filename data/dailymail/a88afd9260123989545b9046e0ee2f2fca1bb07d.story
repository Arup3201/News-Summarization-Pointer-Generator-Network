A seven-year-old girl was left in tears after she found a clump of hair in a home-cooked lasagne made with a packet of beef mince.

Trudy Stock, 29, said her daughter Shani has suffered nightmares since her discovery.

Ms Stock, from Gosport, Hampshire, said the hair, believed to be part of the cow's hide, had come from a £3 packet of frozen mince bought at the town's Iceland store.

She told the Portsmouth News: 'It's completely traumatised her now. She was in buckets of tears.

'She was enjoying it until she found that and burst out crying.'

Ms Stock said Iceland had investigated and given her £30 in vouchers as an apology.

An Iceland spokesman said: 'Iceland has apologised to the customer and offered a gesture of goodwill and we will carry out an investigation with our supplier to determine how it happened.'
