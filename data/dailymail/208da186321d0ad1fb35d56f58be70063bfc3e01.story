Lionel Messi has opened the door to a dramatic departure from Barcelona one day by telling Argentine newspaper Ole that he wants to stay at the Nou Camp but that players don’t always get what they want.

'I live for the here and now and all I’m thinking about is having a good season and winning the trophies that we want to win at Barcelona,' he said. 'After that we will see. Things change very quickly in football.

'I have said many times that if it was up to me I would stay here [at Barcelona] forever. But you don’t always get everything you want, and even more so in football, where so many different things happen and so much can change. It is complicated and even more so with all that things that are happening at Barcelona.' 

Lionel Messi, who has been at Barcelona his entire career has hinted he may not end his career there

Messi has a contract at the Nou Camp until 2018 and a buy-out clause of £200million but there is instability at the club with many supporters wanting elections, due in 2016, to be brought forward to next summer.

The club has been banned from making signings after breaking rules over the signing of underage players, and Messi and his father Jorge are being taken to court by the Spanish Inland Revenue for unpaid taxes.

His imminent departure remains out of the question but his latest comments reaffirm the idea that a move to another European club before he returns to Argentina to play out the last days of his career at his first club Newell’s Old Boys is no longer out of the question. 

Both Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain would want the 27-year-old, though meeting his clause without destroying their financial fair play credentials would remain an obstacle.

Their remain two schools of thought among the power-breakers at the Nou Camp. One group see Messi as a sacred institution at the club who should never be sold. Another more pragmatic group believe Neymar is the club’s commercial cash cow going forward, and that if a buyer can be found for Messi any offer over £120m should be seriously considered.

Messi was also asked about his World Cup in the interview. He said: 'I would like to have played better in the semi-final and final but that is the way tournaments go sometimes.

'If I had scored that goal in the final everyone would have said what a great tournament I had and how I had played well in every game.

'I didn’t score it so I get criticised. Those two games were not my best but neither were they as bad as some have suggested.'
