Tony Pulis has been appointed head coach of West Bromwich Albion, replacing Alan Irvine who was sacked on Monday.

The 56-year-old, who has been out of work since leaving his post at Crystal Palace before the season, has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal at The Hawthorns.

And the former Stoke City and Crystal Palace boss was pictured arriving at Upton Park on New Year's Day, where he will watch his new side take on West Ham United from the directors' box alongside his trusted No 2 David Kemp.

'I'm absolutely delighted to accept the job and I do so with a simple but important message for the Albion fans and everyone at the club,' Pulis said. 

'Every successful club is built on unity and that is what I shall strive to help bring to Albion. We need everyone together from top to bottom – the supporters, all the staff, the players, everyone who has an interest in the club's welfare.

'With that, we can go forward together and hopefully take this club up the Premier League.'

West Brom technical director Terry Burton added: 'We are delighted to secure a man of Tony's calibre and proven ability.

'He made it clear that this position excited him and that he was eager to get back into the business of winning Premier League points - and there are few who know how to do it better.'

Pulis has replaced Alan Irvine who was sacked by the Baggies late on Monday night

Pulis takes over at West Brom with the club 16th in the Premier League, just one point above the relegation zone. 

Irvine was dismissed late on Monday night after a 2-0 defeat by Pulis's former club Stoke made it just a single win in nine games for West Brom.

Pulis will charge of the team for the first time when Gateshead visit in the FA Cup on Saturday.

Chairman Jeremy Peace has agreed to amend the Welshman's contract so he is satisfied he has total control of transfers - a potential stumbling block.

It is clear Pulis, who takes the title 'head coach', will have a much greater role in player recruitment than predecessor Irvine, who came from an academy role.

Pulis left Selhurst Park - having been named Manager of the Year for his relegation rescue mission - following a fallout over transfers.

He will compile a list of  targets he hopes can help him maintain a remarkable record of never being relegated in 22 years as a manager.

Peace had been focused on loan signings but is now expected to make funds available for permanent deals.

On the way out are Sebastian Blanco, Jason Davidson, Georgios Samaras and Chris Baird. Record signing Brown Ideye, who cost £9million, has also failed to impress.

Caretaker boss Rob Kelly is expected to leave the club when Pulis' arrival is officially announced

Technical director Burton retains his job and will help identify targets for Pulis but it remains to be seen how their relationship develops. Mervyn Day, head of recruitment, also stays.

West Brom have been prioritising a new, mobile striker and want pace on both flanks. Another full-back would be welcome too.

Ben Marshall, the Blackburn winger, has been tracked and would cost £3m, while Wigan's Callum McManaman could be available for £5m.

Rob Kelly and Keith Downing will take charge of West Brom at Upton Park but both are likely to leave once Pulis brings in trusted assistants David Kemp, currently in Florida, and Gerry Francis.
