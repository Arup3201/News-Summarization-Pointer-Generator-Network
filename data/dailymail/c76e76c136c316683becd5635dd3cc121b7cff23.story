A dead newborn baby girl was discovered by a dog in Oklahoma City on Saturday and the family pet carried her body home in its mouth.

The dog's unnamed owner was out of town so the pet, Luke, returned the infant's body to the house-sitter at the property just off South Air Deport Road.  

The mixed breed was carrying the three to five pound dead baby, which had been wrapped in plastic, in his mouth and placed it by the woman's feet around 8am, KFOR reports.

Gentle: Luke, a six-year-old mutt, is a gentle dog that would never have hurt the child, his owner insists

Returning home: The dog called Luke brought the plastic wrapped baby's body back to this home in Oklahoma City

Police do not believe the dog was in any way involved in the baby's death but merely stumbled across the abandoned body.

'He was carrying it just like a momma pup and laid it at my feet,' the house-sitter told the station

'I believe [Luke] found it, picked it up and brought it. There was no trauma you could tell he inflicted.'

Police are now desperately searching for the infant's mother, who they believe may be suffering from health problems following the birth.

They are also examining the body to try and establish whether the baby was born alive or was a still-birth. 

Police Captain Dexter Nelson told the broadcaster: 'We don’t know where 
the baby came from. If it was born in the area outside or if someone
brought the baby out there to dispose of it.'

Luke tends to roam over a large area making things even more complicated for police.

Gentle: Luke returned home carrying the baby harmlessly in its mouth 'like a mamma pup,' his caretaker said

No crime? Police Captain Dexter Nelson said medical examiners are trying to determine whether the baby was alive when she was dumped or whether she was stillborn

Oklahoma has a 'safe haven' policy which allows a mother to anonymously leave a child which is less than a week old at a designated place without fear of questioning.

No one has reported a missing baby in the area or come forward with information this week.

Police are now going door to door and are combing the area to try and find discarded evidence.

'We are asking anyone in the public who knows someone who was pregnant not too long ago who is not pregnant now or if they believe this child could be that child or involved in that situation to call us,' Nelson told the Oklahoman.

'We don't know if the baby was stillborn or what the cause of death was in this particular case, but that's why homicide is investigating.'

'We do not even know at this time if a crime has even occurred.'

'Due to the condition that the child was found, we believe that the mother could be at risk of health problems,' he added. 

The baby was described as white and her mother would have been in her third trimester.
