A fight over a handicapped parking spot ended with a 71-year-old woman being hospitalized with a broken leg and the need for a second hip replacement.

The confrontation at the Walmart store on West Layton Avenue in Greenfield, Wisconsin, saw two women, both with handicapped tags on their cars, face off over the space.

Kezia Perkins, 32, was attempting to park in the handicapped spot, but couldn't make the turn into the space.

That's when the unidentified 71-year-old woman pulled in instead in her SUV.

Surveillance footage from February 3 shows Perkins block in the SUV, then get out of her car and move around to the driver's window, out of sight. 

Perkins can been on surveillance footage rushing around the back of her car to confront the 71-year-old woman that cut across her to get to the handicap spot

Bystanders described how Perkins walked up to the older woman and 'chest-butted' her causing her to fall backwards

She hit the ground hard and rolled onto her side in pain, having recently had a hip replacement - the fall broke her leg

As Perkins began to return to her car, witnesses rushed forward to help the older woman who lay on the ground in agony

She returned to her own car, appeared to look for something in her trunk and then went back to the other vehicle and yelled through the passenger side window.

Perkins once again returned to her own car, and after a brief moment the SUV driver emerged and began to walk around the vehicle towards the store.

The footage shows the two women exchanging words over the roof of Perkins' car before she rushes around the back of it and appears to shove the older woman to the ground.

The 71-year-old hit the ground hard and rolled onto her side in pain as Perkins began to return to her car.

Bystanders, including John Rawlins of West Allis, rushed to help the woman who was now laying in the slush and ice.

Kezia Perkins, 32, was attempting to park in a handicapped spot at Walmart when the driver of an SUV cut her off and pulled into the spot

'From what she told me when I was tending to her, she just had hip surgery done. She couldn`t move. It may have come undone,' Rawlins told Fox 6.

Perkins was charged on Wednesday with felony aggravated battery and appears in court next week

In describing what happened he said: 'This lady chest-butted,' referring to Perkins.

Perkins is alleged to have told police: 'it’s not my fault the elderly woman bounced off my big (chest).'

When Greenfield police checked her license and handicapped tag they found that the license wasn't valid and the tag wasn't even registered in her name.

Perkins was charged on Wednesday with felony aggravated battery, and could face six years in prison if convicted and up to $10,000 in fines. She appears in court next week.

Police said that the victim went through five hours of surgery after she was attacked to fix fractures to her femur.

She also needed a second hip replacement.

Perkins' lawyer issued a statement maintaining her innocence and that she is handicapped.

'This was an unfortunate accident that came about after a misunderstanding between two individuals. Ms. Perkins is, herself, disabled, however the fact that her disability is not immediately noticeable led to confusion between the two women.'
