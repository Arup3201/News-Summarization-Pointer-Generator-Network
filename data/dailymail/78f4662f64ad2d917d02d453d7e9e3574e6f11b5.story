Jailed: Lewis Robert McDonald veered across carriageways and went the wrong way round a roundabout while drunk

A coach driver who took passengers on a terrifying 70-mile journey while drunk has been jailed for nine months. 

Lewis Robert McDonald, 68, of St Helen's, Merseyside, veered across carriageways and drove the wrong way round a roundabout forcing other drivers off the road during the journey from Liverpool to Penley in November last year. 

The horrified passengers, members of a primary school PTA who had been on a shopping trip, screamed at McDonald to get on the right side of the road while drivers hooted their horns. 

As the coach went over The River Dee, the passengers feared they were going to end up in the river.

When the coach eventually stopped, a motorist who had followed for 15 miles jumped on board and seized the coach ignition keys to stop McDonald driving any further.

According to police, when they arrived to arrest him, McDonald said: 'That's me finished.'

A breath test three hours after he set off from Liverpool showed McDonald, a coach driver for 40 years, had 58 microgrammes of alcohol in his breath compared to the legal limit of 35.

Mold Crown Court heard how the 49-seater coach had been booked by the PTA of Madras Primary School in Penley to take 30 adults and four teenagers on a shopping trip to Liverpool One.

McDonald was an hour late picking them up in the morning because he could not find the village but at this point no-one was concerned about his driving to Liverpool.

However, prosecuting barrister Caroline Harris said he was 15 minutes late collecting them in the evening.

Headmistress Lynda Houston later described how on the M53 McDonald drove in the middle lane at about 20mph.

On the M56 the coach started swinging from side-to-side in a rocking motion causing passengers to panic.

As the coach reached the A483, other drivers decided to take action and sounded their horns as McDonald changed lanes a number of times for no apparent reason.

A passenger explained how he turned off the dual-carriageway and drove the wrong way around a roundabout 'as if he was not aware that the road was there.'

Passenger Sue Chadwick was so scared she put her mobile phone in her bag in case it got lost if the coach turned over.

Motorist Michael Clarke followed the car for 15-miles because he was so concerned by McDonald's erratic driving.

His wife rang the police and when the coach stopped at Penley he seized the ignition keys.

McDonald said he had not touched a drop for weeks but had a relapse and had returned home during the day for a couple of tumblers of whiskey and coke.

'You have one and then you have two don't you,' he told police.

Oliver King, defending, said his client had a strong work ethic and was a professional coach driver for 40 years.

He also described him as a devoted family man, adding: 'He will never get behind the wheel again.

'He is sorry and ashamed for what happened.'

A prison sentence at his time of life would be very difficult to serve, said Mr King.

He added that McDonald had never been to custody before and his 22-year-old grandson, who suffered from MS, had recently died of a heart attack.
