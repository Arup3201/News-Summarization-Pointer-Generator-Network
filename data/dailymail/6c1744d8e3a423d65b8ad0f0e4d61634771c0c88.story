Tragic: Donations to Susan Taylor's chosen charities have reached £67,000 since she died trying to swim the English Channel

A staggering anonymous donation of £300,000 has today been made to the charities supported by tragic cross-Channel swimmer Susan Taylor.

The administrators of her fundraising page were said to be in 'no doubt' the donation is genuine but were waiting for the money to make its way through bank checks before being certain.

The donor has asked to remain anonymous and it was possible they might opt not to even have the size of their donation listed on the fundraising website.

The money has been pledged to be split evenly, £150,000 each, between the two charities Susan was supporting - Rainbow Children's Hospice and Diabetes UK.

As of this morning the combined figure raised stood at £67,000 but that is set to be boosted considerably.

Staff at Virgin Money Giving will keep any record of the donation off the list of donors until they are able to confirm the money has been collected and transferred to the bank accounts of the two charities.

Karen Payne, spokeswoman for Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People, said: 'We are aware of an anonymous donation of £150,000 being pledged to our charity but we can't confirm it until the money is in our bank.

'Obviously we are very grateful for all money donated to us and this amount would be great but hopefully you can appreciate we have to be a bit cautious until we receive the money pledged.'

Paul Amadi, Diabetes UK’s Director of Fundraising said: 'To receive such a large donation from one person is absolutely amazing and we are extremely grateful.

'We wish the tragic events of Sunday hadn’t happened, but this incredible gift and all the other donations are part of Susan Taylor’s legacy and will go to help people with diabetes and the Rainbows Hospice.'.

Mrs Taylor, 34, died when she was just a mile from the French coast during her swim on Sunday.

Brave: Mrs Taylor, 34, wanted to emulate David Walliams' charity swim but died one mile from France

Fundraiser: David Walliams, pictured during his 2006 Channel swim, is believed to have donated £1,000

Her husband and brother were on the support boat when she was pulled out of the water and given lifesaving attempts.

Speaking in Boulogne, where his wife 
of six years was airlifted to hospital on Sunday, Stephen Taylor, 43, 
said he was ‘proud to have been part of his beautiful wife’s life’ and 
was ‘devastated by her loss’.

In a statement he added: ‘Susan was a determined, strong and dedicated person who gave her everything to whatever she did.

'She
would have been so proud of the massive response and support for her 
chosen charities, Diabetes UK and Rainbows children’s hospice.’

It
emerged that Mrs Taylor, of Barwell, Leicestershire, had vomited 
several times due to fatigue and a reaction from the salt water.

She was dragged from the water by her support team but was declared dead on arrival at Boulogne hospital.

Thousands of people have since donated money to the charities Mrs Taylor was raising money for.

Much-loved: Susan's father described her as 'the best person in the world'

Dedicated: Mrs Taylor had spent 18 months preparing for her arduous challenge for two charities

Prepared: Mrs Taylor's progress team posted this picture during her swim, writing: 'Easy way versus the hard way!!!!! Susan definitely deserves the easy way next time!!! She's doing fab :)'

The
money was boosted when comedian David Walliams - who swam the Channel 
in 2006 - tweeted the links to the charities to his 1.2million 
followers.

He is 
believed to have pledged £1,000 after a donation was made under the name
of the Little Britain star with the message 'Sending all my love to 
Susan's family and friends'.

Walliams
tweeted later: 'Despite the shock & sadness, it's good to see 
heroic Susan Taylor's charity total rising. Please give what you can...'

The
star also tweeted a link to Mrs Taylor's Facebook page Create A Ripple 
Channel Swim, writing: 'Susan Taylor's channel swim attempt very sadly 
ended in tragedy. This is her charity page if you want to donate...'

Mrs Taylor had reportedly written in a blog post her ambition to follow in Walliams' footsteps by swimming the Channel.

'I've had an ambition to follow in comedian David Walliams's strokes and swim the Channel since I was a child,' she wrote.

Fundraiser: Mrs Taylor had temporarily given up work to train for the swim

Her mother, Joyce 
Wright, said the family had been anxious about the swim, despite her 
being in peak physical condition.

And she said her 40-year-old son David
felt guilty about being unable to save his sister’s life on the boat.

‘Our son is a paramedic so he’d taken kit with him. He’s devastated. 
He’s blaming himself,’ added the 68-year-old.

‘But he did everything he 
could. He just needs to have a big cuddle when he gets back.

Mrs Taylor had spent 18 months 
preparing for her arduous challenge in one of the busiest shipping lanes
in the world.

She even quit her job as an accountant to train full 
time.

She set off from Dover at 1am on 
Sunday covered in goose fat and with her brother and her husband, 
43-year-old electrician Stephen, in the support boat.

Friends and family had watched her progress online through a link to a GPS device that tracked her for 16 hours and 20 miles.

But they became concerned when they 
noticed her position marker stopped for several minutes before racing 
off in the direction of Boulogne.

Her brother then posted the message: 
‘Whilst attempting to swim the English Channel yesterday my sister, 
Susan, collapsed suddenly in the water.

‘She was immediately recovered from 
the water and treated on the support boat.

An online map tracking Ms Taylor's progress appeared to show that her support boat had suddenly sped up and sailed in a different direction towards land

Mrs Taylor was initially rescued from Wissant Bay near Cap Gris-Nez on the French coast

Lifeguards: Huart Alexandre, 22, left and Giolet Rudolph, 35, right, went to Susan's aid and performed CPR

'She was then airlifted by 
helicopter to a hospital in Boulogne. Susan tragically passed away.’

Huart Alexandre, 22, a French 
lifeguard who responded to the emergency call, said: ‘We performed CPR 
for 45 minutes but she still wasn’t breathing.

‘Her husband had gone below the deck because he couldn’t bear to watch what was happening. He wanted to be alone.’

Mr Wright urged donors to carry on 
giving to his sister’s fundraising page.

Mrs Wright said: ‘Susan was struggling with the currents and the tide.

'She was obviously tired. She collapsed in the water.

‘The hardest bit is the last bit and 
she knows that. She was about two kilometres from France and was 
battling against the tide.

'We know Susan wouldn’t have got out of the 
water, she wouldn’t give up.’

Susan's father Arthur, 68, added: ‘I’m 
devastated. I’ve lost the best person in the world. She was just 
wonderful.’

Her parents said she had swum a relay in Windermere four months ago and a Channel relay last year in training.

Swimming
coach Paul Farrier, who had known Mrs Taylor since she was a child, 
praised her enthusiasm and said she always had a smile on her face.

In a press conference, part of which was broadcast by ITV News, he said: 'As I watched her on Sunday morning as she set off on her journey, I saw what I knew back 30 years ago. I was going to help her achieve her amazing goal that she had set out on two years ago.

Tributes: Neighbours at the Taylor family home in Barwell, Leicestershire, paid tribute to a 'truly lovely girl'

'Her commitment to her training meant
that she had put on hold her career as an accountant so that she could 
give, because this was what Susan was really about.

'She
was a natural giver. So when Susan approached me two years ago and 
asked me if I would be so kind as to help her on her journey - she told 
me that she was swimming for charity, the Rainbows Hospice charity based
in Loughborough, my home town. Having taught children with severe 
learning difficulties myself for a short time, the answer was a 
no-brainer.

'She then added
Diabetes UK - again as a Type 2 diabetic myself, no brainer. On top of 
this, she endlessly worked as an ambassador for Rainbows Hospice 
charity.'

France does not allow cross-Channel 
swims to start from its own side because of the dangers posed by 
shipping, as well as dangerous currents and changing weather conditions.

Mrs Taylor is the eighth swimmer to 
die since Captain Matthew Webb made the first unassisted swim across the
Strait of Dover in 1875.

The last fatality was 45-year-old Paraic Casey, of Cork, Ireland, who died last July.

Like Mrs Taylor, he became ill a mile from the French coast.
