Parody singer 'Weird Al' Yankovic's latest album has become the first comedy record in more than 50 years to top the Billboard charts.

The 54-year-old cult singer has found fame over the last 30 years by parodying popular songs of the day, with the likes of Like A Surgeon (Madonna's Like a Virgin), Eat It (Michael Jackson's Beat It) and Smells Like Nirvana (Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit).

His latest record, Mandatory Fun, however has become the first number one of his career after it was launched with a promotional campaign which saw eight new music videos released in as many days.

The singer's latest album features parodies of recent hits including Pharrell's Happy, or as Yankovic's is called, Tacky (pictured)

The album features his trademark parodic style on versions of recent pop hits including Pharrell's Happy (Tacky) and Lorde's Royals (Foil).

The album sold 104,000 copies in its debut week, according to figures compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, making it the first comedy record to top the chart since 1963.

The album has also had the most weekly sales for a comedy album since 1994.

Yankovic, whose previous highest charting album was 2011's Alpocalypse which reached number nine, told the Associated Press: 'This has been an amazing week. I can't even tell you.

'I have been doing roughly the same thing for many, many years, and this is the best week of my life in terms of like the response from people. 

'It's just insane and it's extremely gratifying. It's hard for me to wrap my head around (it).' 

The latest record, the first comedy album to top the charts in 50 years, also features Yankovic's version of Lorde's Royals, called Foil (pictured)

The online video campaign to promote his latest album has reportedly been a remarkable success, with the videos being viewed a total of 46million times, according to The New York Times. 

The paper said the videos, rather than being funded by record label RCA, were in fact paid for by websites including CollegeHumor, Funny Or Die and Nerdist.

The singer, who famously seeks for the approval of each artist he parodies, has also spoken of how he managed to get in touch with Pharrell Williams to speak to him about doing a version of his hit Happy.

The singer has found fame over the last 30 years by parodying popular songs of the day, with the likes of Like A Surgeon (Madonna's Like a Virgin) and Eat It (Michael Jackson's Beat It)

Explaining that while the usual procedure is for 'his people' to get in touch with the 'artist's people', Yankovic said in this case he went straight to the source after he didn't hear back from Pharrell's camp.

'I somehow got Pharrell's home email address - I won't say how - and I emailed him and asked if I could do the parody,' recalled the comedian.

'He couldn't have been nicer and he said he was honored to have me do the parody.'
