A day after arguing for deep budget cuts to America's military, the Obama administration has told the Defense Department to prepare for a 100 per cent withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Obama has made clear his desire to draw down troops from the war-torn nation by year's end, but Tuesday marked the first time a scenario has been discussed publicly that would completely void Afghanistan of U.S. personnel who have been vital in fighting Taliban militias.

'President Obama has asked the Pentagon to ensure that it has adequate plans in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014,' the White House said Tuesday morning.

That message was part of a phone call between Obama and Afghan leader Hamid Karzai on Tuesday, during which the U.S. president reportedly pressured him to accept the terms of a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) that has been pending for months.

The Obama administration has made the agreement, drafted in November, a requirement if it is to leave a counter-terrorism force in Karzai's country after the larger U.S. pullout is complete.

Barack Obama may be playing a game of chicken with Hamid Karzai, designed to force the Afghan leader's hand before he passes off power later this year

Sad sack? Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel had to tell reporters on Monday that U.S. military strength would be pared back to ts levels in 1940

Karzai has been putting off the decision to sign the BSA, saying that it should be left for his successor.

Elections will be held in April to choose the next president.

But that process could drag on for months since Afghanistan's presidential election process is a two-stage system that may not be complete until July or August.

A Defense Department source told MailOnline that existing Pentagon plans call for as many as 10,000 troops to remain behind, split between training forces and special operators equipped to raid Taliban strongholds.

But those plans are fluid. And since so many NATO allies in Afghanistan depend on U.S. troops for logistical support and just-in-time war materiel, those world powers are finding it hard to plan without a clear nod from the Americans.

And Obama's decision is already limiting the choices of a NATO panel of defense ministers meeting this week in Brussels, Belgium.

The NATO group is weighing how many troops to place in Afghanistan next year, and the political tug-of-war between Washington and Kabul promises to wreak havoc with those plans.

If Karzai's successor isn't in place until the end of the summer, the Pentagon source cautioned, NATO will find itself in a time crunch with just months or weeks left to finalize deployment decisions.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai wants to pass the decision about an American security agreement to his successor, but that may leave a US-dependent NATO with too little time to plan its 2015 deployments

U.S. troops are a common sight -- for now -- in Kabul, where at least one person was killed and four others were wounded during a bombing

Most
 of the major-party contenders for the Afghan presidency have spoken in 
favor of the U.S. agreement, but NATO generals and the Pentagon don't 
want to premise billions of dollars in logistical moves on the uncertain
 outcome of a Middle Eastern election.

'We will leave open the possibility of concluding a BSA with Afghanistan later this year,' the White House said Tuesday.

Ouch: Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Tuesday that President Obama would rather spend federal dollars on food stamps than on a strong military

'However,
 the longer we go without a BSA, the more challenging it will be to plan
 and execute any U.S. mission. Furthermore, the longer we go without a 
BSA, the more likely it will be that any post-2014 U.S. mission will be 
smaller in scale and ambition.'

Karzai has been cantankerous and his commitments have become more elusive as the U.S. has withdrawn platoon after platoon. But the Pentagon knows that he can't run for the top post again.

His war of words with Obama may be a case of one lame duck speaking to another â€“ the worst circumstance for Obama's latest move if it's just an Oval Office bluff.

The Defense Department, however, insists that the president may actually order a complete withdrawal after the NATO meeting in Belgium, where Secretary of State Chuck Hagel will represent U.S. interests.

'Without question, the issues surrounding the future of the Afghan mission will certainly be discussed in Brussels, to include the challenges of retrograde and force posture faced by all Allies,' Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told The Guardian.

'We long said that we would like a BSA as soon as possible. Absent that,' he vowed, 'we would have to start planning to withdraw all our forces by the end of the year.'

Obama told his Afghan counterpart that if he doesn't sign a Bilateral Security Agreement, all the American troops in his country could vanish

@highlight

The move might be a colossal bluff since it's timed with a NATO defense ministerial where 2015 troop deployment decisions could be made

But Obama has already shaken up the military with a Pentagon announcement that Army troop levels will be cut down to pre-WWII levels

And additional budget slashing announced Monday suggests that the president is serious about limiting the role of U.S. might abroad
