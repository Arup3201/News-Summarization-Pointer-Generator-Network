A major Los Angeles street ground to a halt Tuesday when a broken water main ruptured and shot out a massive geyser that flooded a large part of UCLA campus, stranding motorists and ripping a 15-foot crater in the asphalt.

The 30-inch pipe broke beneath Sunset Boulevard causing water to inundate the north end of the campus with an estimated 8 to 10 million gallons of water, submerging athletic fields and pouring into an underground parking structure.

Crews helped rescue motorists whose cars were caught in water up to their wheel wells and no injuries were reported, though hundreds on campus for the summer continued to trudge through water up to knee-deep in some spots.

The water 
pipe, which carries 75,000 gallons per minute when it's functioning, 
broke at about 3:30 p.m. and was shut off about 3 1/2 hours later, 
Department of Water and Power spokesman Jim McDaniel said.

'Unfortunately,
 we lost a lot of water, around 35,000 gallons a minute, which is not 
ideal in the worst drought in the city's history,' City Councilman Paul 
Koretz said, 'so we ask everybody to try harder to conserve water.'

Three
 buildings were damaged. In addition to Pauley Pavilion, the Wooden 
Center, which has training facilities for students, and the J.D. Morgan 
Center, which houses the school's sports trophies and athletics offices 
were also flooded.

Fire
 and police officials swarmed the chaotic scene that featured 
helicopters hovering overhead and backpack-bearing students wading 
across campus in ankle-deep water. Meanwhile, some fun-seekers went in 
the water with body boards.

Los Angles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said that fire department's swift water rescue teams were on scene as a precaution.

Firefighters have been searching cars in the structures to make sure they haven't lost anybody who was inside, Humphrey said.

Millions of gallons of water flowed across the school's athletic facilities, including the famed floor of Pauley Pavilion, the neighboring Wooden Center and the Los Angeles Tennis Center, and a pair of parking structures that took the brunt of the damage.

The arena -
 where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Reggie Miller and Kevin Love 
starred and John Wooden coached for 10 years - recently underwent a $132
 million renovation that was completed in October 2012.

'It's painful. It's painful,' UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said at a news conference. 'We just refurbished Pauley just a few years ago. And it's a beautiful structure. It's of course, a symbolic structure for this entire campus.'

Administrative Vice Chancellor Jack Powazek said the school may need to make contingency plans, but 'luckily we're not in the middle of basketball season.'

Firefighters,
 some using inflatable boats, have saved at least five people who were 
stranded in the underground parking structures.

Old, unfaithful: The geyser from the 100-year-old water main flooded parts of the UCLA campus and stranded motorists on surrounding streets

Two
 hours into the deluge, Los Angeles Water and Power spokeswoman Michele 
Vargas told the AP the water main would take another two hours to shut 
off.

Vargas
 says the pipe has to be turned off slowly to avoid more damage. Normal 
water flow through the pipes is 75,000 gallons per minute, reports NBC Los Angeles.

City officials say the pipe that was laid down in 1921 carries water from a reservoir in the San Fernando Valley.

The cause of the break hasn't been determined.

Local 
television images showed students wading through knee-deep water as the 
geyser continued to pour water onto nearby Sunset Boulevard.

Firefighters placed sandbags outside of classrooms and aided drivers stuck in water and mud.

'The
 Number 1 thing is to keep hundreds of students from wandering into the 
water where they could get swept off their feet,' Humphrey said.

The water main break poured thousands of gallons of water onto the UCLA campus and nearby streets as California suffers a record drought

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said in a statement that several crews are on the scene shutting down valves and being careful not to cause more breaks.

Sunset, a major thoroughfare through the city's west side, was shut down in both directions, jamming traffic during the afternoon rush-hour commute.

The city's Department of Water said workers were working to shut down multiple valves that would stop the water from flowing from the 30-inch main without breaking any nearby pipes.

The water main break poured thousands of gallons of water onto the UCLA campus and nearby streets as California suffers through a record drought that has prompted state and local authorities to impose water-use restrictions on residents.
