Oscar Pistorius is to sell the luxury mansion house where he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp to raise money for his legal bills.

His lawyer Brian Webber said in a statement today that it had 'become necessary' for Pistorius to sell the villa in a gated community in Pretoria because his ongoing murder trial will go beyond the expected three-week duration.

Webber added that the 27-year-old Paralympic has never returned to the upmarket £278,000 ($458,000) house since he fatally shot Steenkamp in an upstairs bathroom in the pre-dawn hours of February 14 last year.

Webber says Pistorius 'cannot contemplate ever returning to live there again' - since the shooting he has been living at his uncle's house in Pretoria.

He said the Olympian's home has remained 'sealed' since it was handed back by police over a year ago.

Estate agent Ansie Louw, who is handling the sale, told MailOnline the house will be sold in a closed bid which started today at five million rand (£278,000) and will be open until 21st March.

She said the process was unusual due to the situation: 'We were not allowed to take photos or put it onto our website. If they do open it they attract lots of people just interested in the case and it will be chaos.'

Ms Louw said that although the home had been a crime scene it would still attract interest.

'It is not normal circumstances. It is not a normal process. But you know what some people say it doesn't both them.'

She told MailOnline there has already been interest in the home from one overseas buyer and explained that potential buyers need to email an address, put down a $5,000 deposit and sign an agreement before they are sent photos and plans of the whitewash house. The deposit is returned if their bid is unsuccessful. 

The final decision about who buys the home will be made by Pistorius' attorneys and Ms Louw said 'because it is a closed bid the buyer needs to be a cash buyer' and the new owners would be able to move into the house by April.

Pistorius valued the house at five million rand during his bail application in February last year.

At
 the time he also owned two other houses with a combined value of 1.5 
million rand in Pretoria and a vacant plot worth 1.6 million rand in 
Cape Town.

All his properties together were worth 8.3 million rand, the sporting hero told the court.

Since the shooting he lost many of the endorsement deals that earned him some £300,000  ($510,000) a year.

The athlete has been paying his own legal fees since the shooting, according to the statement.

The
 costs - reportedly as high as £5,000 ($9,000) a day - are said to include at 
least three full-time lawyers in court, ballistics and forensics experts
 as well as an American crime scene reconstruction company.

Yesterday
 a court in Pretoria heard Steenkamp was standing in a toilet cubicle 
and facing the closed door when she was hit in the right hip by the 
first of four bullets that he fired, a police ballistics expert 
testified Wednesday at the double-amputee runner's murder trial.

Steenkamp fell back onto a magazine holder in the cubicle and crossed her arms over her head to protect herself, said Capt. Christiaan Mangena.

The second bullet missed Steenkamp and ricocheted off the wall and broke into fragments, bruising her back, he said.

Steenkamp was then hit in her right arm and in the head by the third and fourth shots fired by Pistorius with his 9 mm pistol, he said.

She collapsed with her head on the toilet seat, Mangena said.

Questioning: State prosecutor Gerrie Nel questions ballistics experts Captain Christiaan Mangena over how Ms Steenkamp was killed

Pistorius is charged with 
premeditated murder and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted. He says he shot 
Steenkamp, 29, by mistake through a locked door in his bathroom because 
he thought she was a dangerous nighttime intruder.

Pistorius
 says Steenkamp went to use the toilet during the night without him 
knowing, but prosecutors charge he killed her after a loud argument that
 caused her to flee and hide in the toilet area.

Neighbors have testified to hearing loud screaming before and during the shots being fired.

Mangena, the ballistics expert, concluded that one of the final two bullets fired by Pistorius went through Steenkamp's left hand, which she held over her head, before it penetrated her skull. The policeman said he couldn't determine the order of the last two shots.

As Mangena threw his hands up to cover his head in court to re-enact Steenkamp's cowering position, and described details of the head wound, Pistorius put his fingers in his ears in an apparent attempt to block out the testimony.

June Steenkamp, Reeva's mother, was in the courtroom and occasionally glanced at photos of the bloody scene of her daughter's shooting.

Mangena said the bullet that struck Steenkamp's skull broke into two fragments, one of which exited her head and struck the wall behind her. The first shot into the right hip broke Steenkamp's hip bone, Mangena said.

'I'm of the opinion that after this wound was inflicted, my lady, she dropped immediately,' Mangena said, addressing the judge. Steenkamp slumped into a 'seated or semi-seated position' on top of the magazine rack in the cubicle, where she was hit another two times, he said.

Pistorius fired from a distance of at least 60 centimeters (24 inches) and no further than 3 meters (9.8 feet) away, where there was a wall behind him, Mangena said. He described the impact of the hollow point bullets in Pistorius' gun, which were designed to cause maximum damage to an intended target.

'It hits the target, it opens up, it creates six talons, and these talons are sharp,' Mangena said. 'It cuts through the organs of a human being.'

The defense said it would challenge Mangena's testimony regarding the sequence of the shots.

Also Wednesday, the chief prosecutor said he planned to wrap up his case early next week after calling four or five more witnesses. Judge Thokozile Masipa granted Nel's request to adjourn the trial until Monday so that Nel has time to consult his last witnesses. No court session is scheduled on Friday, which is a national holiday in South Africa.

'We foresee that we'll call four or five more witnesses and that we'll be able to close our case early next week,' Nel said.

His lawyer said that Pistorius has never returned to the house since he fatally shot Steenkamp in an upstairs bathroom in the pre-dawn hours of February 14 last year

In other testimony Wednesday, police Col. Ian van der Nest testified that many of the blood spots and stains found in various parts of Pistorius' house were due to arterial bleeding, consistent with the gunshot wounds on Steenkamp's head and arm.

Some stains came from Steenkamp's blood-soaked hair as well as her short pants, which had been saturated with blood, he said.

Another witness, Col. Mike Sales, investigated the web history on two iPad tablets found in Pistorius' home.

He analyzed the activity on one of the devices hours before Steenkamp was killed, he said. Around 6.30 p.m. South African time on Feb. 13, according to records shown on TV monitors in court, a search was made on Google for a pornographic website. Then, straight after, a page was accessed that was described with the words 'Mobile Porn, Free Mobile Porn, iPhone Porn, Phone Porn, iPad Porn.'

Other Internet searches referred to car websites and details on cars, including a Ford Ranger SUV, an Aston Martin and a British-made Morgan sports car. Col.

Sales said the searches and website history on the second iPad showed similar records to the first.
