This footage shows the moment an angry driver confronted a speed camera operator and accused him of impersonating a police officer.

Grant Pain, 41, approached the civilian worker as he sat in a marked police van that was parked on the main road in Maerdy, Rhondda, South Wales.

The 11-minute video, which Mr Pain later posted on Facebook, shows him challenging the camera operator as he tries to hide his face from the camera.

The operator repeatedly asks Mr Pain to stop filming, before finally phoning police colleagues for back up.

In the video, which has been shared more than 64,000 times, an irate Mr Pain says to the camera operator: 'You are in a police vehicle and because you are in a police vehicle, Iâ€™m allowed to film you.

'You should not be impersonating a police officer in a police vehicle.'

Mr Pain continues from behind the camera: 'You are not a police officer. Are you a police officer, sir?

'If you are not a police officer, in a police van, then you should not be impersonating a police officer in a police vehicle.

Chief Inspector Martyn Stone said: 'Mobile speed camera units are staffed by police employed personnel and there is no requirement for camera operators to be police officers.

'The staff employed for this purpose are fully trained in the equipment they use, however they are not accustomed to dealing with confrontational situations.
