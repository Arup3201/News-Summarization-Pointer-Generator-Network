Terrorist: Anwar al-Awlaki before he was killed last year

Within days of the 9/11 terrorist attacks the FBI suspected  American Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki had booked flights for the hijackers.

The reason for the flights remains unclear, but 9/11 Commission report later noted that 
the hijackers had used flights in the run-up to the attacks to test 
security and surveillance.

Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, 
had become the lead figure for al-Qaeda and the offshoot al-Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula in the years after Osama bin Laden went into hiding.

'We have FBI documents showing that the 
FBI knew that al-Awlaki had bought three tickets for three of the 
hijackers to fly into Florida and into Las Vegas, including the lead 
hijacker, Mohammad Atta' Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, told Fox News.

He
explained that the records seen by the news station, show the cleric 'was a central focus of the 
FBI's investigation of 9/11. They show he wasn't cooperative. And they 
show that he was under surveillance.'

One
FBI investigative report indicates a credit transaction for 'Atta, 
Mohammed -- American West Airlines, 08/13/2001, Washington, DC to Las 
Vegas to Miami.'

According to the Joint Congressional Inquiry into 
9/11, the 
mid-August flight, was one of Atta’s numerous 
and crucial surveillance flights.

The CIA went on to assassinate al-Awlaki
in a drone attack because he was known to have preached to the 9/11 
hijackers and his videos were found across Britain in terrorist homes 
and in an extreme bookshop used by the 7/7 attackers.

Before his death, he was believed to 
be responsible for persuading Nigerian terrorist Omar Farouk 
Abdulmuttalab to conceal explosives in his underwear which he tried to 
use to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on December 25th, 2009.

He also played a role in the 2009 
Fort Hood massacre and the failed plot by Faisal Shahzad to detonate an 
SUV filled with explosives on May 1, 2010.

Relaisation: The FBI suspected within days of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that the American Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki may booked flights for the 9/11 hijackers

Other individuals identified by Fox News through the report show a credit card record for Satam al-Suqami who was one of the muscle hijackers on American Airlines 
Flight 11, which slammed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 and “W. al-Sheri -- National Airlines, 08/01/2001, San Francisco to Las 
Vegas to Miami.” 

This could be either of the al-Shehri brothers - Waleed and Wail -  the pair were also hijackers, according to the
9/11 Commission report.

Last month an MI6 agent who managed 
to infiltrate al-Qaeda in a bid to kill Anwar al-Awlaki revelaed how he 
was told by his British bosses they would not assassinate him because it
could be against the law.

Terrorist
Anwar al-Awlaki was encouraging attacks on the West and also recruiting
young Muslims to carry them out but despite being able to murder him 
Morten Storm was blocked by London, it has emerged.

Storm
says he was told by his bosses in the UK: 'We do not involve ourselves 
in encouraging people to participate in jihad and we don’t involve 
ourselves in killings abroad. Our objective is to gather intelligence.'

British secret services then cut Storm off completely when he approached the Americans instead, he has claimed.

Claims: MI6 spy Morten Storm could have killed terrorist leader Anwar al-Awlaki but Britain said no, he says

A source told the Daily Telegraph that no spy can kill anyone without permission from the Foreign Secretary.

Advice
says 'Lethal force' can only be used in those circumstances in an 
'emergency or crisis which causes danger to the UK or its citizens' - 
which means it has not been used for decades, the source added.

Storm
and al-Awlaki, who was a U.S. citizen and lived in the UK for two 
years, became so close he was offered $250,000 by the CIA to find a wife
for Awlaki - who already had two - in an effort to track him down

To do this, Storm turned to Facebook, and found 'Aminah' - who said she was a fan of Awlaki.

He
then orchestrated an exchange of video messages between the two, and -
despite an assassination order on Awlaki from the U.S. - they agreed to
marry.

But while successful in its early stages, the rest of the CIA's plot was thwarted.

Storm suffered a troubled childhood, drifting through drugs and into crime.

In 1997, the Dane said that he converted in prison to Islam and upon leaving moved to Yemen to study the Koran.

He added that in 2000 he married a Yemeni woman with whom he had a son named Osama.

It is understood in 2006, he had a dramatic and unexplained change of heart and was turned double agent by the Danish intelligence service, PET.

When Fox News asked the FBI for comment 
on the documents Bureau spokeswoman Kathleen Wright said: 'The FBI 
cautions against drawing conclusions from redacted FOIA documents.'
