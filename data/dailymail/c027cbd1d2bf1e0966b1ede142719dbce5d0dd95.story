From its glamorous spectators to its stylish competitors, tennis has always been a fashionable affair that values its players' ensembles nearly as much as their backhands.  

In celebration of the sport's longstanding relationship with fashion, publishing company teNeues is releasing The Stylish Life: Tennis, a coffee table book exploring the game's preppy yet glamorous cultural evolution.  

'Tennis grew as a sport from the Victorian time, played by the aristocracy,' author Ben Rothenberg told the Wall Street Journal. 'Looking good was just as important as playing the game.'

A-list sport: Diane Keaton and Woody Allen hold tennis rackets during a scene in the 1977 film Annie Hall 

The photography book is filled with both modern and vintage images of the celebrities, the players and the preppy outfits embraced by the sport, including snapshots of a young Jacqueline Onassis and Swedish tennis heartthrob Björn Borg.

The $55 tome is due out in March as a part of the publishing company's new sports series, which also features style-oriented coffee table books about golf and yachting. 

'From Wimbledon to other prestigious venues around the globe, tennis courts are a place to see and be seen - and admire the skill of the players, of course! Crisp, sporty tennis outfits by the likes of Lacoste and Fred Perry epitomize a relaxed yet active life,’ reads the book’s description. 

It's true that tennis's most notable contribution to fashion has to be the iconic polo shirt, which was invented in 1933 by French tennis champion René Lacoste.

Mr. Lacoste designed the short-sleeved shirt to give players the freedom of movement, adding a small green emblem inspired by his nickname, 'The Crocodile'. 

Nearly two decades later, English tennis champ Fred Perry debuted his own line of polos that featured a logo based on the original symbol for Wimbledon.

And in recent years, a number of players have followed in Mr Lacoste and Mr Perry's footsteps by teaming up with big brands to launch their own sporty collections.

American tennis pro Venus Williams debuted her line EleVen in 2007.

Three years later, Russian player Maria Sharapova started the Nike Maria Sharapova Collection, and in 2011 America pro Andy Roddick collaborated with Lacoste for his own collection with the iconic label. 

Designers Stella McCartney and Diane von Furstenberg have also presented their own fashionable tennis collections for Adidas and Reebok, respectively. 

And then there are the slew of celebrity spectators who frequent tennis matches around the world.  

Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, who is famously friends with Swiss player Roger Federer, can often be seen wearing luxurious designer ensembles while cheering him on in the stands.

Kate Middleton, Karlie Kloss, Heidi Klum, Mary-Kate Olsen and Scottish tennis player Andy Murray's fiancee Kim Sears are also among the stylish elite who continuously turn heads at the star-studded matches.

Tennis's symbiotic relationship with fashion continues to flourish on the runway as well. 

Last Saturday during New York Fashion Week, Lacoste's designer Felipe Oliveira Baptista paid homage to the label's namesake by sending an eclectic mix of sophisticated sportswear down the runway, including a long-sleeve polo shirt that had the phrase 'René Did It First' splashed across the front. 

And Rag & Bone's plunging V-neck tennis sweater from its spring 2014 collection became an instant hit among stylish celebrities including, Jaime King, Lindsay Lohan and Liv Tyler.
