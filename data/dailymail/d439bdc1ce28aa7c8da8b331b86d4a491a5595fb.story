A tiny fragment of finger bone has enabled scientists to map out the entire genetic code of the Denisovans, a little-known ancient cousin of modern humans.

Evidence suggests that the Denisovans, who lived in Siberia around 50,000 years ago, had dark skin, brown hair and brown eyes.

Previous research has suggested they co-existed with Neanderthals and interbred with our own species, Homo sapiens.

The researchers compared the Denisovan genome with genomes of several modern humans from around the world.

The Denisovans share more genes with populations from the islands of southeastern Asia, including Melanesia and Australian Aborigines, than with populations elsewhere in Asia.

Analysis of the Denisovan genome further illuminates the relationships of Neandertals with individuals from East Asia, South America and Europe.

The existence of the Denisovans was only confirmed in 2010.

Scientists made the discovery after studying DNA from a piece of finger bone and two molars found at Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia.

Today the same group reported results from full scale genome sequencing which produced a Denisovan genetic blueprint on a par with those obtained for modern humans.

Because they had only a tiny sample of material from the finger bone, Svante Pääbo and his research team developed a treatment that unzipped the DNA so that each of its two strands can be used to generate molecules for sequencing.

This method allowed the team to generate an extremely thorough genome sequence (30X), similar in quality to what researchers can obtain for the modern human genome.

The scientists found that the Denisovans were most genetically similar to Australian aborigines and island populations from south-east Asia.

They listed about 100,000 changes in the human genetic code that occurred after Homo sapiens and Denisovans parted company on the path of evolution.

They also show that the Denisovan individual whose genome was sequenced carried genetic variants that in present-day humans are associated with dark skin, brown hair and brown eyes, and that the genetic diversity of the Denisovans themselves was extremely low. 

Given the Denisovans’ wide geographic range over time, the team say it’s likely that their population was initially quite small but grew quickly, without time for genetic diversity to increase

'This research will help determine how it was that modern human populations came to expand dramatically in size as well as cultural complexity while archaic humans eventually dwindled in numbers and became physically extinct,' said lead scientist Professor Svante Paabo, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

The research is published today in the journal Science.

There are hints that both the Denisovans and Neanderthals emerged from a single population that migrated out of Africa.

Modern humans are believed to have left Africa to colonise other parts of the world hundreds of thousands of years later.

In time, Homo sapiens inherited the Earth while the Neanderthals and Denisovans became extinct.

The researchers also found that people from eastern Asia and South America possessed slightly more Neanderthal genes than those from Europe.

This suggests that their ancient ancestors were more likely to have interbred with Neanderthals.

Computer simulations were also used to reconstruct the fingerbone
