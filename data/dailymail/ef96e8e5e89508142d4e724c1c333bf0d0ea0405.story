A man who built Britain’s biggest private aquarium in his basement may be forced to get rid of his pets after he received a £11,000 energy bill.

Jack Heathcote, 39, created the underwater world in the basement of his five-bedroom home in Carlton, Nottingham, filling it with tropical species from the Amazon and Congo.

But the installation in his red-brick Edwardian property, which measures 12ft 6in by 12ft 8in by 7ft, needs plenty of power to keep the 4,800 gallons of water at the right temperature for the creatures.

Mr Heathcote, whose tank is filled with species from Congo and the Amazon, was issued with an £11,000 bill by British Gas following a meter reading

It previously cost the salsa teacher £6,000-a-year in heating and filtering cost.

But he’s just been hit with a huge arrears bill from British Gas after an error with his meter readings.

Initially, the company demanded he pay £11,000 - which has since been decreased to £4,500.

Mr Heathcote is currently appealing against paying the bill - while British Gas are threatening him with disconnection if he doesn’t.

The man says he will have to get rid of the tropical species because he can no longer afford the electricity - and instead replace them with freshwater fish.

Mr Heathcote, who built the 4,800-gallon tank 10 years ago, said: 'It’s a tremendous blow, it has really cut me up.

Mr Heathcote sits in the tank - which he accesses through the bay window on the floor above. British Gas have since decreased his bill to £4,500 - but the salsa teacher says he may still be forced to get rid of the fish

Mr Heathcote cleans the tank. He says is furious at the energy company who claims have behaved 'atrociously'

'I have gone to great lengths to provide a suitable spacious home for these creatures and now I’ve got to get rid.

'I’m really angry, because the way they have behaved has been atrocious.

'They should have recognised they have made a mistake and been apologetic for that and not be trying to charge me this enormous bill.'

His collection of fish includes some 
valuable species like two chainsaw doradids, three 2ft long Pacus, some 
Pangasius, a Red tail hybrid catfish, two alligator gars, eight enormous
 stingrays and two Fly River turtles.

The aquarium is so large that Mr Heathcote has to dive in every fortnight to clean it. The only way in is through the the bay window in the living room above.

Mr Heathcote, who has been fascinated by fish since a trip to a Blackpool aquarium when he was ten said: ‘My hobby’s not only taken over my life, it’s taken over my home. But I love it!’

Mr Heathcote and his former girlfriend bought their Nottingham home with the intention of turning the cellar into one massive fish tank.

Three of the tank's edges are foundation walls of the house. A large section of floor was removed by the bay window to allow access. Downstairs, a wall of glass has replaced the brick wall, and behind it are some of the largest fish kept in captivity.

The tank cost £5,000 to install - including £700 for glass and £800 for fibreglass lining.

Mr Heathcote said: 'When it’s full there’s around 4,800 gallons in the tank and I’m on a meter.

'Each water change sees up to 1,200 gallons being taken out and then replaced and even with my high pressure hose, it takes six hours to re-fill.’

‘When I bought the house I knew exactly what I wanted to do in the cellar and the work really didn’t take that long.'In his previous home, he built an indoor tropical pond which he filled with 12 stingrays.

Last night British Gas said Mr Heathcote had not paid anything for months, despite their attempts to resolve the issue and the offer of different payment plans.

The company also claimed it had reduced the bill from £11,000 to £4,500 and sent him accurate readings.
