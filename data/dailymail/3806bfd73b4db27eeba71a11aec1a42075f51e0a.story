Three Queens sailed out of Southampton port last night as their departure heralded the end of the spectacular Diamond Jubilee four-day weekend of celebrations.

Cruise company Cunard had sailed its three ships into port together for the first time yesterday morning as a special tribute to the Queen's 60 year reign.

Queen Victoria, Queen Mary 2 and Queen Elizabeth sailed in single file into Southampton, Hampshire, shortly after dawn with a fire tug and a flotilla of small boats welcoming them in.

As Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria took a bow-to-bow position close to City Terminal, Queen Mary 2 passed each ship in turn, creating a three-bow formation, as flag-waving crew lined the foredecks, and the ships' whistles sounded in salute.

The nautical show kicked off a day of celebrations in the city to celebrate the Queen's 60 years on the throne with live bands and entertainment.

The Red Arrows were due to give their first ever display over the city yesterday evening but bad weather meant the show had to be cancelled. But, despite the rain, there was still a spectacular fireworks show in the run-up to the ships leaving port at 11pm.

Organisers said the Southampton festivities were the biggest celebration outside London during the extended bank holiday weekend.

Speaking about the ships, a Cunard spokeswoman said: 'Yesterday was all about the opportunity for the three Cunard Queens to celebrate Her Majesty and her Diamond Jubilee.

'Cunard is proud of its association with Her Majesty and we are delighted to be able to honour her on this special day. It brought a lump to the throat when you saw these three magnificent ships together.

'There were crew out waving flags and lots of noise and there was a real positive spirit. It was a really special moment.'

The finale to the celebrations comes as one million people descended on a rainy London to watch the Royal Family acknowledge their affection from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.

The Queen emerged to a deafening roar flanked by Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Camilla and Prince Charles. The only senior member of the Firm missing was Prince Philip, who is in hospital.

To the strains of Land Of Hope And Glory, led by a military brass band, the patriotic crowd gathered in anticipation before she and the rest of the Royal Family emerged for the military fly past and feu de joie gun salute.

In a nod to the typical British weather, the masses gave a rendition of Singing In The Rain and shouts of 'We want the Queen' rang out.

The Jubilee well-wishers surged along The Mall led by police on horseback in an extraordinary scene, and as ever, the drizzle did little to dampen their spirits.

If anybody was in any doubt that Britainâ€™s love for the monarchy had waned, this national outpouring of pride would soon dispel that belief, in a week that witnessed a huge surge in popularity for the Royals, and particularly the Queen.
