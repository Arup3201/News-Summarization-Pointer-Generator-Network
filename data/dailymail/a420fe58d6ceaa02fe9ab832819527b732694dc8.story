Dressed up in a white, plunging gown and full make-up, I have already turned a few heads in the London bar in which I’m sipping a cocktail.

So when I see my husband Tom striding across the floor, I’m confident that, for once, I should have his full attention. I flash him a beaming smile — yet he walks straight past me.

I suppose I can hardly blame him. For while he has spent 20 years going to bed with a curly haired brunette, tonight he will be snuggling up with a blonde bombshell.

My conservative chestnut waves — perfectly appropriate for a 42-year-old mother-of-three who lives in the Home Counties — have been replaced by a poker-straight, platinum blonde bob — and my personality has undergone something of a transformation, too.

I’m usually quite shy (not to mention married) but, emboldened by my new look, I find myself catching the barman’s eye and smiling at strange men across the room.

And the best thing about my new image? In the morning I can go back to my conservative dark hair and avoid attracting the opprobrium of the other mums on the school run.

For I am following the advice of Domestic Goddess Nigella Lawson, famed for her dark, sultry appearance, who this week revealed the secret to her party look: wigs.

Short, long, curly or straight, the chef says she loves them all. ‘Other people do paper hats at Christmas. I do wigs,’ she confessed.

‘Most of the year I’m not a party person, but I love a Christmas do, and go for it full tilt.’

While the celebrity chef probably doesn’t need to watch the pennies, at around £25 per wig, changing your hair colour could be cheaper than splashing out on new frocks for the party season — and it’s guaranteed to have far more impact.

‘This is not about fancy dress,’ stresses Claire Pateman, of online hair emporium Annabelle’s Wigs, where Nigella buys her wigs.

‘She loves to go blonde for the night, whereas my alter ego is a red-haired vixen. You can transform your look in an instant without the expense or regret of an expensive haircut. You can spend the night as a feisty redhead or a blonde bombshell . . . You can be whoever you want to be.’

As someone who has never even dyed her hair, let alone experimented with dramatic cuts, I’m a little nervous at the prospect of following Nigella’s lead and donning outrageous wigs.

So will these five very different wig styles pep up my wardrobe for the festive season — or just leave me with one very confused husband?

Nigella's platinum bob

£25.99, annabelleswigs.co.uk

CHARLOTTE’S VERDICT: With her porcelain skin and chiselled cheekbones, Nigella carried off this striking platinum blonde bob with aplomb. But I’m not convinced the colour — let alone the Cleopatra-esque fringe — will suit my round face and double chin quite as well. I change my mind as soon as the wig is in place.

To be honest, I can’t quite believe the swan-necked beauty I see in the mirror is really me. I’m transfixed by how green my eyes look (they are hazel but my colouring always brings out the brown) and the cut is so modern and funky. It couldn’t be more of a dramatic change from my boring hair, which just hangs there like glossy spaniel’s ears.

I’m a middle-aged Lady Gaga and I love it. Tom thinks I look ‘quite cute’, too — once he recognises me, that is.

The Towie Blonde 

Charlotte tries out a long blonde wig - and her daughter's assume she has dressed up as Princess Elsa from the Disney film Frozen. She says the 'Towie' wig doesn't make her feel liberated, but rather repressed

£26.99, annabelleswigs.co.uk

CHARLOTTE’S VERDICT: OK, so now I’m a living Barbie doll. I’m exploring my inner TOWIE — except I don’t want to. I long to smoulder quietly in the corner as a bookish brunette rather than strut about like a low-rent glamour girl. It’s just such a cliche. I don’t feel liberated, I feel repressed.

My husband and daughters don’t see any of this gender politics. Tom says: ‘I didn’t recognise you,’ in an alarmingly positive tone, before asking if we can keep it.

My daughters assume I’m dressing up as Elsa, the icy heroine of the Disney film Frozen. ‘You could go to parties and sing Let It Go,’ they cry.

It’s the wig I want to let go. It’s not me. Not even for a night.

The Claudia Winkleman 

The fringed wig did not go down well with Charlotte's family who said she looked like  Morticia Addams

£26.99, annabelleswigs.co.uk

CHARLOTTE’S VERDICT: I have an adventurous friend who is constantly experimenting with fringes, but I’m too chicken. Also, I can’t shake off a sneaky suspicion it’s a little too mutton-dressed-as-lamb for a woman over 40 (sorry Claudia Winkleman and Carol Vorderman).

My friends are complimentary, saying it frames my face and ‘looks much more modern than your usual haircut’. Gee, thanks! I’d wear it to trendy parties — but it wasn’t a winner with my family. Tom, who does a double-take when he comes in to find me washing up wearing my new do, says I look like Morticia from the Addams Family.

To be fair, it does accentuate the bags under my eyes. The final word goes to the children, who say I look like a witch.

The family hamster 

This wig made her feel like a 'prim secretary' and Charlotte says she would be traumatised if she had her hair cut and coloured in this style

£26.99, annabelleswigs.co.uk

CHARLOTTE’S VERDICT: I look awful in this wig. The colour does nothing for me, the cut makes my head look smaller, my face rounder and my eyebrows look like two black slugs.

I feel like I’ve aged ten years, and wearing it even changes my personality — I find myself behaving like a prim secretary. Tom is even more brutal — he says I look like the family hamster.

I certainly don’t feel as feminine now I don’t have any long tresses to swish hither and thither.

No wonder, then, that my friends and husband are unanimous in their verdict to ‘take it off’.

Thankfully, I can. I would be traumatised if I’d had my hair cut and coloured like this.

The sexy school ma’am

Her husband said this style made her look younger and slimmer because her neck and shoulders are visible

£76, hothair.co.uk

CHARLOTTE’S VERDICT: I thought Tom would hate this look. He has always been possessive about my long hair, telling me it’s one of my best features. But he’s the first to admit he likes this cut, albeit in a ‘sexy schoolteacher’ kind of way.

He says it makes me look younger (yay) and slimmer (double yay) because my neck and shoulders are on show.

My friends rave about the cut, telling me it frames my face and makes my eyes look enormous — always a good thing. But I feel I look too much like my dad to feel terribly sassy (sorry Pa!).

I guess if I wore this wig enough times, the length might grow on me!
