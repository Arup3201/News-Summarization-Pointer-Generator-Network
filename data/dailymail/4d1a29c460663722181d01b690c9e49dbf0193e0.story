England stretched their undefeated run to eight matches as a late Andros Townsend strike canceled out Graziano Pelle's first-half header. 

Here Sportsmail's Rob Draper casts his eye over Roy Hodgson's side and their Italian hosts.

England (4-1-2-1-2)

Joe Hart 7

No blame attached for the goal and a very good save from Eder on 51 minutes. One of the positives for England.

Nathaniel Clyne 5 (Walker 45)

Always willing to offer an outlet in attack but the system left him exposed in defensive areas and switched at half time.

Chris Smalling 5

Aggressive and firm early on but along with Jagielka completely failed to dominate the box when needed most for Italy's goal.

Phil Jagielka 5

Heavy touch in bring the ball out and, along with Smalling, failed to command the penalty area for Italy's goal. Look ill at ease.

Kieran Gibbs 6 (Bertrand 88)

Like Clyne, often looked lost without support from a wide midfielder. Had chance to equalise on 54 minutes but drove into side netting. Improved in second half.

Phil Jones 4.5 (Carrick 44)

When Carrick came on to relieve him from the holding midfield role as it was though he'd escaped purgatory. Static and beaten embarrassingly easily for the goal – but better, unsurprisingly as centre half.

Jordan Henderson 6 (Mason 74)

Scurried here and there with plenty of intent but little guile. Didn't ever really settle into the system.

Fabian Delph 5.5 (Townsend 70)

Much the same. Harried and was strong in tackles but too often was a man chasing around in search of a game plan.

Wayne Rooney 7

The flashes of class England showed invariably came from him; shot off the bar on 22 minutes, a glorious cross field ball for Walcott on 27 minutes. Tested Buffon in second half – perhaps should have scored on 72 minutes.

Harry Kane 6

Lost in a vortex of team-mates' inability to pass the ball. Looked eager to impress with no opportunity to do so until late on when he had strikes to trouble Buffon.

Theo Walcott 5 (Barkley 55)

Looked out of place in a front two and even more so when he played behind the front two. Never convinced.

SUBS 

Michael Carrick 8

Provided much better distribution that Jones could; baffling why he didn't start. England were much more fluid with him on the pitch.

Kyle Walker  6

Exposed almost immediately when Eder drifted past him to set up scoring chance but improved from thereon in.

Ross Barkley  7

Offered more pace, drive and direction to the England midfield. Will be encouarged.

Andros Townsend  7.5

Superb strike for goal which rescued England and sparked by far their best period. Incisive and ful of running even though on left.

Ryan Mason 7

Can feel satisfied with a decent debut. Contributed to England's best spell

Ryan Bertrand  6

Italy: (3-5-2)

Gianluigi Buffon 7.5

Rarely called on initially but fine save from the Rooney striker on 72 minutes and then again on 80minutes.

Andrea Ranocchia 6.5

Part of an immaculate back three for an hour – suddenly looked a little vulnerable as the changes unsettled Italy.

Leonardo Bonucci 7

Looked imperious until the changes in the last 15 minutes left Italy looking a little exposed.

Giorgio Chiellini 7.5 (Moretti 72) 

Beat Jagielka to deliver glorious wrong-footed cross for Pelle goal. Was great in defence before being wrong footed for the Rooney chance a minute before being taken off. 

Allesandro Florenzi 6.5 (Abate 60)

Solid throughout – was full of running when England's midfield allowed him space in the first half.

Marco Parolo 7 

Able and capable in possession – well on top of England's midfield for much of the game.

Mirko Valdifiori 7 (Verratti 67)

Quietly distributing in the Pirlo role – may never be in that class but did his job last night until replace by Verratti.

Roberto Soriano 6

Decent performance, passed well and kept his head. Only lost track in final twenty minutes.

Matteo Darmian 6.5 (Antonelli 73) 

Plenty on incursions down the left as Clyne struggle to contain his man.

Graziano Pelle 7.5 (Immobile 60)

Lovely glancing header to make it 1-0, his first goal since January. Replaced on the hour by Immobile.

Eder Citaden Martins 6 (Vazquez 60)

Not as successful as Pelle; best chance on 55 minutes when Hart saved.
