Pleaded guilty: Tanya Brookes, 46, wore her police ID as she persuaded shops to give her a full refund for luxury items she bought at a cut price

A police chief inspector has been convicted of a catalogue of petty frauds after tricking High Street stores into giving a full refund for discounted luxury items.

Chief Inspector Tanya Brookes, 46, bought cut-price breast pumps, Micro Scooters and cashmere blankets in bulk on eBay and in discount outlets.

The mother-of-four then created false bank statements on a computer showing she paid the full amount for the high-end items - then took them to different stores for a full refund.

Wearing her police ID lanyard, she would demand a refund in what the prosecution branded an abuse of trust.

Brookes, who worked under her maiden name of Sillett, was found guilty to 25 counts of fraud and cleared of two at an earlier trial.

Today, she pleaded guilty at 
Winchester Crown Court to a further eight charges of fraud. Sentencing has been adjourned until May 6.

Nicholas Tucker, prosecuting, described Brookes as a 'high-flyer' who went to great lengths to carry out petty frauds despite earning a 'healthy salary'.

Though she was not on duty at the time of the offences, he added she used her position in Surrey Police Force to manipulate High Street staff.

He said: 'It is our case that despite the healthy salaries which she and
 her husband enjoyed as senior police officers, Mrs Brookes - for 
reasons which may remain a mystery - expended an extraordinary amount of
 effort and her own time devising various scams, principally targeted 
against High Street retailers.

'To compound matters, we say that on 
occasion she exploited her status as a police officer in order to 
inspire trust in individuals she meant to deceive.'

Her main targets were Boots, Waitrose, Micro Scooter and luxury homeware store The White Company.

At first, she bought Poitier cotton sheets and satin-edged cashmere blankets from The White Company's outlet store in Bicester, Oxfordshire, before taking them back to the Godalming store with a false bank statement.

Then, she bought £35 Sculptinex facial treatments, £120 Clearblue fertility monitors and £130 Medela breast pumps in bulk on eBay - and took them back to Boots for their full retail price.

Mr Tucker also told the court how Brookes bought forged discount vouchers for Lurpak online and used them in Waitrose.

Luxury homeware store The White Company was one of her main targets, as she bought cashmere blankets for a discount and took them back to the store with false bank statements

Boots handed out hundreds of pounds to the former chief inspector when she produced false statements claiming she had paid the full price for £130 breast pumps and £120 fertility monitors

She would falsify a bank statement on her computer showing that the full
 price for the product had been paid and return it to another branch of 
the store and fraudulently reclaim the difference in price.

She would 
tell shop staff that the items had been bought by 'an extravagant great 
aunt'.

Mr Tucker said: 'Mrs Brookes would often be wearing her 
police ID on a lanyard round her neck - this was irregular, and the 
prosecution say it was a ploy by Mrs Brookes to capitalise on the trust 
people tend to place in police officers.'

In another scam outlined 
by the prosecution, Brookes offered to organise a stall selling Micro 
Scooters at her son’s nursery.

Mr Tucker said that despite the fact that
 the PTA declined her offer, Brookes went ahead with the plan and when she received the two promotional scooters offered by the 
manufacturer, she returned them to the Kingston branch of John Lewis in exchange for vouchers and a different Micro Scooter.

A further five offences which she 
denied were ordered to lie on file. A further two charges of acting with
 intent to prejudice/defraud HM Revenue and Customs which were due to be
 heard at a third trial will also now lie on file.

Last
 month Brookes, of Godalming, Surrey, was found guilty following a trial
 of nine offences of making an article used in fraud, 14 of fraud and 
two of converting criminal property. She was found not guilty of a 
further two offences.

Details
 of the previous trial could not be reported until all outstanding cases
 against Brookes had concluded. Her case was adjourned for sentencing on
 May 6.

Following the hearing, assistant chief constable Gavin Stephens, of 
Surrey Police, said: 'We expect the highest standards of conduct from 
all of our employees and this kind of behaviour has no place in Surrey 
Police.

'The vast majority of our officers and staff who serve the 
people of this county are professional and hard-working and the public 
rightly trust them to act with integrity at all times.

'We will not 
hesitate to thoroughly investigate any evidence of wrong-doing and take 
swift action if any officer is involved in criminality.

'This was a 
complex investigation but thanks to the painstaking work of the officers
 involved, the scale of offending behaviour by Tanya Brookes was 
uncovered and she has been brought to justice.

'The Force immediately
 referred this matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission 
(IPCC) when it came to light and Brookes was subsequently fast tracked 
through our disciplinary procedure and dismissed from her job.

'Our action in this case demonstrates that Surrey Police continues to hold itself and its employees to account at all times.'

In
 November 2012, Brookes appeared before a fast-track gross misconduct 
hearing and was dismissed without notice from Surrey Police.
