The team appears to be standing by Spillman, who plays on special teams and had made an appearance in every Cowboys game this season.

'He'll take part in everything with our football at this time unless the circumstances change,' head coach Jason Garrett said Thursday. 

'You have to be careful with just accusations and allegations in this situation. When someone is officially charged or arrested for something, that's when it becomes a different situation in our minds. For now, he's a member of our football team and will take part in everything we do to this point.'

The NFL, fresh off a raft of criticism for its handling of Ray Rice's domestic abuse arrest and the child abuse charges against Adrian Peterson, has launched its own investigation.

League officials have offered to interview the alleged victim 'on a confidential and appropriate basis to obtain more information' about the case, a league spokesman said.

Celebrity attorney Gloria Allred is representing the woman Spillman is accused of raping and has called for him to be taken off the field.

She also bashed the NFL for making public a later she sent to the league and questioned whether an interview with the alleged victim would indeed be kept confidential. 

On the same day that Spillman was accused of rape, he flew with the Cowboys to St. Louis, where he played against the Rams. Last Sunday he played against the New Orleans Saints.

Team officials have refused to say when exactly they learned that Spillman had been accused of sexual assault. 

'I'm not going to make any comment on an investigation where there've been no arrests or charges made,' coach  Garrett said.

'Having said that, we've been very clear with our team about consequences that there will be if there is a situation where charges or arrests are made for a crime. We've been clear about that. That doesn't apply in this particular case.'
