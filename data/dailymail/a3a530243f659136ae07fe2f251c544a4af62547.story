A German single mother who has worked as a nurse caring for disabled people for 17 years has been fired after her bosses discovered that she had taken a job as an erotic model to make extra money.

Lisa Burger, 38, had worked for the evangelical church-owned care home looking after disabled people since she was 21.

But after struggling to make ends meet she had also taken on jobs as an erotic model wearing sexy underwear for catalogues.

But that eventually cost her her day job when she also agreed to do a porn movie, and her employers were told about it.

She said: 'This was my first job and I have always given everything, prepared to stand in when others are sick and often doing the most antisocial hours, but all of that now seems to have been forgotten after I was fired. I am really angry about it but what can I do?'

She said she was hoping that she might be able to extend the modelling work that she was doing to try and compensate for some of the income but added: 'I know that you only have a limited amount of time you can work in this game, and I'm starting it rather late.' 

The decision to sack the blonde has become the number one topic on everyone's lips in the care home where Lisa works in a small village of 5,000 on the outskirts of Munich in southern Germany.

She said: 'With 5000 residents, everybody knows everybody else. I have been surprised how many people are supporting me, but I'm hoping that one of them will also help me to get a job.'
