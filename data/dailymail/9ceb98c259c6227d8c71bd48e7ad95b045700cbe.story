The US-led coalition against Islamic State was under increased pressure last night as the King of Jordan pledged to avenge the brutal murder of one of his pilots.

King Abdullah, a strong ally of Washington and London, had personally taken the decision to take part in controversial air strikes in neighbouring Syria that led to First Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh being burned to death.

But some Jordanians say they have already paid too high a price to support America’s military operations in the region and have questioned the king’s approach and their role in the coalition.

Horrific: Moaz al-Kasasbeh, in a still from the ISIS video, as the flames reach him in a locked cage 

Intelligence officials believe the sickening situation has been manipulated by ISIS to put pressure on Jordan and foster opposition to its role in the coalition

It is estimated that some 1,500 Jordanians are already fighting with jihadi groups such as ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and there is concern that long-term participation in the coalition will fuel extremism.

Significantly, it emerged yesterday that the United Arab Emirates, one of four Arab nations in the anti-ISIS coalition, had already stopped air strikes and would not resume them until improvements were made to contingency plans to rescue downed pilots.

The king promised a ‘relentless’ operation against ISIS in a defiant speech last night in response to the murder of its pilot, whose F-16 fighter crashed in December over the jihadi Syrian headquarters in Raqqa.

Speaking on state television, he said: ‘We are waging this war to protect our faith, our values and human principles, and our war for their sake will be relentless and will hit them in their own ground.’

The pilot’s father, Safi al-Kasasbeh, who had previously raised questions about Jordan’s role in the coalition, called for his son to be avenged. ‘I demand the IS organisation be annihilated,’ he said, as the shock and strain of the sheer barbarity of the murder took its toll on the airman’s mother, Issaf, who collapsed and was rushed to hospital after being told details of the death.

Mr al-Kasasbeh added: ‘This murderous organisation, made up of militants from all the world countries, is acting in barbaric ways, violating all the international laws, codes of ethics, and prisoners’ conventions. That is why I strongly demand the government to swiftly take revenge for the blood of Moaz and the dignity of our country.’

Sickening: A boy enjoys the video 

Islamic State yesterday issued a video showing crowds celebrating the pilot’s murder as they watched it on giant screens set-up across Raqqa.

The four-minute video, entitled Muslims’ Joy at Burning of Jordanian Pilot, showed men and children gathering to watch footage of Moaz al-Kasasbeh.

As the airman goes up in flames, the crowd can be heard cheering and shouting religious slogans, before they praise the manner of the murder and ISIS.

The video is filmed in a documentary style, and among those featured is a young boy who smiles and talks passionately about the killing, as well as other barbaric acts.

Fox News has been criticised for featuring the unedited video of al-Kasasbeh’s death on its website.

The American news channel, which had not posted the murders of other hostages, was the only media organisation in the US to offer the video in full.

Malcolm Nance, an expert on radical extremism, told the Guardian: ‘The whole value of terror is using the media to spread terror. [Fox News] are literally – literally – working for Al Qaeda and ISIS’s media arm.’

Jordan’s response began at dawn yesterday when it executed failed Iraqi female suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi, who had been on death row since 2005, and another Al Qaeda-linked terrorist, Ziad al-Karbouly. Four more jihadis are expected to be executed in the coming days.

Unprecedented outrage and condemnation swept across the Middle East yesterday at the new levels of depravity reached by ISIS. Even Al Qaeda criticised the manner of al-Kasasbeh’s death, saying it provided ‘conclusive proof of ISIS’s deviance’.

Islamic State may have decided to burn First Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh alive after seeing the idea on Twitter.

Fanatics had taken it upon themselves to put forward ideas for methods of execution, writing in Arabic that they were suggesting ways ‘to kill the Jordanian pilot pig’.

The discussions began just two days after the 26-year-old was captured in December. The messages were then shared thousands of times by the jihadi group’s web-savvy activists.

Some suggested burning al-Kasasbeh alive and running him over with a bulldozer; in the gruesome video of his execution published by IS, the pilot is indeed set on fire in a cage, which is then flattened by a bulldozer.

The Twitter campaign appears to have been a reaction to others writing messages with the hashtag ‘#WeAreAllMoaz’, in which well-wishers – including Jordan’s Queen Rania and Crown Prince Hussein – praised the pilot.

The timing of the execution suggestions lends support to the theory that al-Kasasbeh was actually killed at the beginning of January. Experts say ISIS’s gruesome video of the murder would have taken some time to edit before its release.

However, intelligence officials believe the situation has been manipulated by ISIS to put pressure on Jordan and foster opposition to its role in the coalition. The fact that Jordan had agreed to exchange 26-year-old al-Kasasbeh for al-Rishawi was seen as driving a potential wedge in the coalition because of US opposition to doing deals with terrorists.

Security has also been stepped up throughout Jordan as fears of further attacks and suicide bombings grew after IS identified other Jordanian pilots and their family homes on the murder video of al-Kasasbeh, urging its supporters to attack them.

A recently retired intelligence officer warned: ‘While the government is trying to create the impression that it is working for Jordan’s interests, people don’t believe it.’

King Abdullah was yesterday greeted by a crowd of several thousand people at Jordan’s main airport as he returned from the United States, with many holding up pictures of the monarch, the pilot and their country’s flag in a show of support. In his televised speech he urged his countrymen to unite.

‘It’s the duty of all of us to stand united and show the real values of Jordanians in the face of these hardships,’ he said.

Military planners admit that while the UAE, Jordan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have all flown missions against ISIS in Syria, they are seen as primarily symbolic amid criticism in the region that it is an American war that does little to force out Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad.

Mamdouh al-Ameri, a spokesman for the Jordanian armed forces, yesterday described al-Kasasbeh as a ‘martyr’ and said their ‘revenge will be as huge as the loss of the Jordanians’. Intelligence officials believe they have identified the location in Raqqa, near the Euphrates River, where the pilot, locked inside a cage, was doused in petrol before being set alight.
