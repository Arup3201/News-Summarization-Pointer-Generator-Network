A woman accidentally set her house on fire today after trying to kill a spider by spraying it with an aerosol and setting it alight.

The incident occurred in Bridgend, South Wales, after the woman spotted the creepy crawly in her home and called a relative for re-enforcement.

After trying and failing to kill it, the pair decided to douse the spider using an aerosol – but accidentally ended up setting the house on fire.

No one was hurt during the incident but the homeowner was forced to call 999 after flames and smoke started billowing from a rear window.

Fire chiefs said flames tore through at least one room of the property in Kenfig Hill – where properties cost in the region of £200,000.

A spokesman for Mid West and Wales Fire Service said: ‘We attended at an incident at Kenfig Hill at 11.57am today.

‘Crews extinguished a small fire at the rear of the property, which was caused when the occupant tried to remove a spider after initially spraying it with an aerosol and then setting it alight.

‘The flames then spread to the rest of the room.’

South Wales Fire and Rescue Service took to Twitter after the incident to advise against similar use of aerosols

The fire service later took to its Twitter page to urge members of the public to avoid using aerosols inappropriately.

In a tweet, fire chiefs said: ‘When attempting to remove spiders from properties, please don’t use lit aerosols.’

The fire service also advised that there were ‘more conventional ways’ to get rid of spiders and insects.
