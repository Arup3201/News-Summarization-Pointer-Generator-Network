Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. In this week's column, why controversial Stan Collymore was right to make a stand over Twitter abuse, young Chelsea striker Patrick Bamford will thrive on loan at Derby and David Moyes will be given time to rebuild at Man United.

CONTROVERSIAL COLLYMORE

There is no doubt, in days gone by, that Stan Collymore has got himself into some very tricky situations.

However, I believe he is a fantastic broadcaster – very knowledgeable, well-researched, at times controversial yet eloquent – and nobody deserves the abuse that he has received on Twitter.

Taking a stand: Stan Collymore suspended his Twitter account during the week in protest at abuse

I also don’t feel it gives people the right to have a go at him just because of his past.

I used to be on Twitter until one night, sat at the front of the Notts County team bus on the way home from a win at Tranmere Rovers, a few of their supporters – and it was only a few – started giving me dog’s abuse.

‘Sign up here to the party when Allen dies,’ one said.

‘Let’s hope he gets cancer,’ another added.

And there were a couple of others of that nature.

Abuse: Collymore spoke out after receiving a torrent of abuse on the social networking site

Demand for action: Collymore said Twitter should do more to block offensive messages

I finally arrived back, absolutely seething and wanting to drive back up to Liverpool to find them.

I awoke the next morning and cancelled my account, relieved to be free of the hassle and the stress it caused.

Twitter can be fun, and I hope Stan doesn’t stop getting behind the keyboard with his controversial and strong views. If it wasn’t for people like him life would be boring.  

THE BIGGEST SIGNING OF THE TRANSFER WINDOW?

The best piece of business in the transfer window so far involves a Chelsea player  –  but forget Juan Mata.

Derby County have signed 20-year-old centre-forward Patrick Bamford on loan from the Blues.

Big future: Patrick Bamford celebrates scoring for Derby County at Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. The young striker is on loan from Chelsea

Watch out for this young man. With his pace, body frame and finishing he reminds me of a young Fernando Torres.

He’s done a fantastic job at MK Dons in League One in the first half of this season, scoring 17 goals in 30 games.

Top form: After scoring 17 goals in 30 matches for Milton Keynes Dons in his previous loan spell, Bamford has started with two in three games for Derby

And Bamford has already scored twice in three games, coming off the bench for Steve McClaren.

They say promotion to the Premier League is worth £120million. If Bamford starts firing this master swoop from McClaren could be worth a fortune. 

MOYES BACKED NO MATA WHAT

It’s heartening to read that Sir Alex Ferguson has assured David Moyes that his job is safe at Manchester United and that he will be the man to rebuild the club.

After the League Cup semi-final defeat to Sunderland he would have been looking over his shoulder, worrying and wondering. And with constant speculation in the media and on social networks about his future, he would not have slept and will be feeling very uncomfortable.

Backing: David Moyes will be given time to mould Manchester United in his own image, according to his predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson

On top of the strains and stresses of recent results, he’s been pictured flying all over Europe looking to find players that will make a difference.

Their squad is nowhere near the standards we have seen at Manchester United over recent years and is poor in comparison to Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal.

Fightback: Moyes was delighted to welcome Juan Mata into his squad after signing him for £37million from Chelsea last week

Signing Mata would definitely not have been his priority, when they already had the attacking options of Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie combined with Adnan Januzaj and Danny Welbeck. It is a very handy forward line with many different options.

But the spine of his team desperately needs two centre-backs and two central midfield players and a clear-out of the old school who are walking around saying ‘we didn’t used to do this’ or ‘we didn’t used to do that’ in training. 

NOTHING SURPRISES ME IN THIS MAD WORLD OF FOOTBALL…

Everton’s Bryan Oviedo breaking two bones in his leg against Stevenage brings back some horrible memories for me.

One of my former MK Dons players Paul Mitchell – who was a dedicated, hard-working, conscientious central midfielder – was involved in a fairly innocuous tackle, 10 yards in front of my technical area, playing at Notts County back in 2007.

Horrific: Phil Jagielka holds the leg of Bryan Oviedo after he sustained two broken bones in his leg during the FA Cup fourth round tie with Stevenage Borough on Saturday

It was clear instantly, as his leg dangled from his knee down like a piece of wet spaghetti, that Mitch had a serious problem.

It’s a horrible feeling as a manager when one of your players suffers a bad injury.

I remember sitting there, not bothered about the score or the rest of the game.

I felt sick and just wanted to leave.

When I finally got to the hospital in Nottingham at half-past-six a top orthopaedic surgeon had been called specially, such was the damage.

Long lay-off: Oviedo was carried off on a stretcher  and ruled out until the end of the season

He looked at the results of the x-ray, spoke to Mitch then called me aside.

He informed me the impact of the injury, from the bottom of his heel, through his ankle and into his shin, was very similar to the head-on car crash victims he usually deals with.

Mitch was only 27, but he would never play again.

I gave him the job of scouting our opposition and analysing our own team performances at MK Dons.

Soon after I left to go to Leicester he was appointed chief scout before being head-hunted at Southampton where he is now head of recruitment.

It was a bit of a disappointing 
weekend in the FA Cup for the underdogs, but the magic of the FA Youth 
Cup was there for all to see last week.

My
 nephew Freddie Grant, who just turned 17, captained Oxford United’s 
youth team against Cardiff on a cold and windy Wednesday night at Didcot
 Town’s Loop Meadow stadium.

Complete control: Cardiff's youngsters thought they had the game won when Tom Burridge (third left) scored a free-kick to put them 3-0 up

Comeback is on: But Oxford mounted a fightback to 2-3, with Josh Ashby (centre) converting a penalty for the first

At 3-0 up, it looked like a straightforward evening for Premier League Cardiff against my nephew’s League Two side.

Oxford
 looked well and truly out of it. But then, they scored twice and 
suddenly hysterical parents were screaming and shouting from the 
terraces urging their sons on.

Each goal scored by both teams sent all 10 outfield players up celebrating by the corner flag like a scene from WrestleMania.

So close: Oxford's Josh Ashby struck the underside of the bar in the 89th minute

When
 Oxford struck the underside of the bar with a shot in the 89th-minute 
but the ball didn’t go in, the sighs of relief from the mum sat next to 
me supporting her Cardiff son was a sight to be treasured.

Cardiff
 went through 3-2 – and I’ve got to thank the Cardiff player’s mum for 
sharing her bag of Quality Street with me throughout the game.

I left there a very proud uncle, wondering whether one day Freddie might make the big step up.
