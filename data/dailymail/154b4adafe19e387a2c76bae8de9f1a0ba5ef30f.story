A list that emerged online over the weekend is said to lift the curtain on tech companies' lucrative internship offers for undergraduates. 

Tiffany Zhong included a screenshot of the list in a Sunday tweet that was picked up by multiple media outlets - along with the words 'Friend made a list of top internship offers.'

Based on the list, multiple tech companies are willing to pay their interns thousands of dollars per month - with generous housing allowances included as part of the deal. 

Quora allegedly offers '$8250/month + $1500 housing' - which would come to a whopping yearly salary of $117,000.

Beats the summer job at home: Apple purportedly offers its interns '$6k salary + $2.5 per month housing ($9500),' according to the digital list

Tech giant Apple purportedly offers interns '$6k salary + $2.5 per month housing ($9500),' according to the digital list.

Social media site Facebook, meanwhile, allegedly is willing to pay interns '$6.8k/mo (return) and housing: $5k stipend.'

According to Zhong's post, Google offers '$7000/month Housing Stipend: "I think 9K?"'

Other companies that allegedly handsomely reward their interns include Pinterest, LinkedIn, Fitbit, Foursquare's New York office, and Microsoft's Seattle office, to name just a few.

Pinterest supposedly offers '$7500 + $1.5k/month housing,' while LinkedIn is said to offer '$44/hour (around $7600/month) + $5k relocation (one time).'

Fitbit SF will allegedly offer its interns '$9.3k/month,' Foursquare '$6000/month and housing: $5k stipend,' and Microsoft '$7.5/mo + Housing $2.5k + $5k returning intern bonus.'

Vox noted that 'You have to remember that these aren't even "real" jobs yet, and they are already paid bundles more than the average national salary (around $44,000). 

Comfortable living: Facebook also purportedly offers its interns a generous package: '$6.8k/mo (return) and housing: $5k stipend' 

Generous offers? Google allegedly pays its interns $7,000 a month, according to the list published to Facebook and later Twitter 

Betabeat reported that the list was first posted by Cornell University student Jessica Shu to a Facebook group called 'Hackathon Hackers.'

In her Friday post, Shu claimed the figures are real and wrote 'HEY HACKATHON HACKERS

'I wasn't sure how to negotiate internship offers so I pulled some numbers from a reddit thread. These are all internship offers received by undergraduate students so hopefully some of you guys will find this useful during negotiations (obviously keep in mind that there are more important factors than salary) — also these numbers are last summer so adjust for inflation when thinking about next summer.'

Shu pays for expenses during the year with money she makes in the summertime, Betabeat reported.

Shu told the tech website of the different price points, 'It’s only the summer, those differences don’t add up to that much. I would definitely put company culture as a significant factor.'
