This is the moment an arsonist tried to burn down a convenience store - but caught his foot as well.

Captured on CCTV, the man is seen creeping into Supps R Us in Melbourne, Australia, clutching a jerrycan at 4am on Boxing Day.

The bizarre footage shows him running to the back of the warehouse out of view - before leaping wildly towards the door, his left leg ablaze.

refuelled by exploding bottles.

But they were unable to save the shop, which burned to the ground.

'The warehouse and all stock within it has been destroyed, however, much of the showroom remains intact,' she said.

No staff were at the factory at the time of the fire.

Ms Huie thanked fire crews for their 'enormous effort' to contain and extinguish the fire.
