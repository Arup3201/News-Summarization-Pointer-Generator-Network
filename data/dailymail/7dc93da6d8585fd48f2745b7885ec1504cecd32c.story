More than 100 Iraqi civilians have won a landmark Court of Appeal battle in their bid for a fresh public inquiry into allegations of torture and inhuman treatment made against British soldiers and interrogators in Iraq.

The group appealed against a High Court decision upholding the Government's refusal to order an immediate, wide-ranging investigation into whether there was systemic abuse, as opposed to ill treatment by 'a few bad apples'.

Some 128 Iraqis complain that ill treatment occurred between March 2003 and December 2008 in British-controlled detention facilities in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq.

The High Court ruled last December that the inquiry being sought was unnecessary because the Government had set up a team, the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), to investigate the allegations of abuse with a view to the identification and punishment of anyone responsible for wrongdoing.

Today three appeal judges ruled that IHAT 'lacks independence' and ordered the Defence Secretary to reconsider.

They also found that other inquiries failed to fully meet the needs of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects against inhuman and degrading treatment.

Today's ruling was made by Lord Justice Maurice Kay, vice president of the Court of Appeal's civil division, sitting with Lord Justice Sullivan and Lord Justice Pitchford.

It was a dramatic victory for Ali Zaki Mousa, from Basra, the lead claimant, who alleges he endured months of beatings and other abuse in the custody of British soldiers in 2006-07.

High Court judges Lord Justice Richards and Mr Justice Silber had rejected his claims for an immediate fresh public inquiry, saying the IHAT investigations were sufficient to meet the needs of justice.

The judges also took into account that there were two other 'significant public inquiries' into specific allegations of ill-treatment of detainees in Iraq - the Baha Mousa inquiry, which reported in September, and the Al Sweady inquiry, where a hearing date has yet to be set.

The High Court said it was possible that a new inquiry might be 'required in due course' - but it was a matter which could 'lawfully be left for decision at a future date'.

Ruling: The Royal Courts of Justice which is home to the Court of Appeal where today's hearing took place

But today the appeal judges disagreed and ruled the Government was failing to meet its duties under Article 3.

Lord Justice Kay said that under the IHAT arrangements, members of the Provost Branch of the Army, which includes the Royal Military Police, were investigating allegations 'which necessarily include the possibility of culpable acts or omissions on the part of Provost Branch members'.

The appeal judge said it was not a marginal case.

'On the contrary, we are of the view that the practical independence of IHAT is, at least as a matter or reasonable perception, substantially compromised'.

The judge said it was also 'entirely foreseeable' that the Baha Mousa inquiry could not satisfy the Government's legal obligations under Article 3 to investigate the allegations being made by the Iraqi civilians in today's case.

The appeal judges also ruled the High Court was wrong to give 'real weight' to the fact that a new inquiry would have 'heavy resource implications' and to adopt a 'wait and see' policy.

They ruled the 'resources argument' was reduced because IHAT lacked independence, and the wait and see policy could not be justified.

Allowing the Iraqi appeal, Lord Justice Kay said: 'It will be for the (Defence Secretary) to reconsider how the Article 3 obligation should now be satisfied.'

Later a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'We note that the Court of Appeal has not ordered a public inquiry but has asked the Defence Secretary to reconsider how to meet the investigative obligations.

'We will examine the judgment very carefully and consider next steps.'

Today the appeal judges gave new Defence Secretary Philip Hammond  until November 30 to decide whether to seek to challenge the appeal court ruling in the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land.

The decision to refuse an inquiry was taken by his predecessor Liam Fox.

The Iraqi claimants' solicitor Phil Shiner, of Public Interest Lawyers (PIL), accused the Ministry of Defence (MoD) of 'deploying every dirty trick in the book' to avoid accountability.

Mr Shiner said: 'The court has found that IHAT's practical independence is "substantially compromised".

'There must now be a judicial inquiry into the UK's detention policy in south-east Iraq.

'It is something we have been calling for since 2004.

'The MoD has deployed every dirty trick in the book to prevent accountability for the hundreds of torture and unlawful killings cases of Iraqi civilians.

'Now it has nowhere to hide.'
