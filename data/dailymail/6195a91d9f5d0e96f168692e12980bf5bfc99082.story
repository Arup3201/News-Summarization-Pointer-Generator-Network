This is the moment a woman believes that the meteorite which streaked across the UK's skies at the weekend crashed to earth.

The partner of florist Joanne Pain, 43, from Redcar, Cleveland, saw a bright light in the sky followed by a loud explosion.

The light was so bright it was captured on CCTV, reflected in the windows of neighbouring houses.

Then Joanne found the melon-sized black rock in a field outside her house.

Joanne said: ‘My partner was outside letting the dog out on Saturday night and he saw something just after midnight.

'He thought it was a firework, but there was no noise, then, just a little bit of crackling as it came down.’

Charred: Joannes says the rock has the 'small white chondrules' which are found on meteorites

She added: ‘We’ve looked it up on the internet and it looks like one. It’s heavy and it has what looks like "small white chondrules" described on the internet.

‘We’ve seen pictures of them where they’ve hit cars on the internet and done quite a bit of damage.’

The rock does appear to fit the description of other meteorites which have hit the earth.

Many of them are tiny - about the size of a pea - even though they can generate incredible brightness while they are subjected to the astonishing heat of penetrating the earth's atmosphere.

Once they finally hit the ground, the meteorite is likely to appear scorched, having reached thousands of degrees Celsius, and could be almost any shape.

Most meteors are made up of a collection
 of dust and tiny mineral grains which have been floating in space since
 the solar system formed. Only around six per cent are made of iron.  

But Dr Tim O’Brien, Reader in Astrophysics at The University of Manchester, has poured cold water on the theory it could be the meteorite, or a fragment of it.

He said: 'This is unlikely to be the meteorite as it was spotted travelling much farther south across England.

'It’s not clear whether any of it did make it to the ground but if it did the likely location would be farther south.'

Thousands of stargazers witnessed a 
spectacular meteor shower last night, as a large fireball streaked 
across the night sky for more than 30 seconds.

The
 brilliant display entranced watchers at several locations across 
England, including Manchester, Derbyshire and the Lake District - but 
now the question on astronomers' minds is where the shooting star fell 
to earth.

Reports of a 'bright light' and an 'orange glow' were received by police across Scotland and the north of England at about 9.40pm yesterday, and the meteor was believed to be brightening as it moved south.

While it first appeared 150 miles 
above Scotland, the fist-sized chunk of rock descended to an altitude of
 about 80 miles above Birmingham and Oxfordshire.

Meteors
 often burn up as they travel through the earth's atmosphere, but 
experts believe this one may have reached the earth's surface intact 
because of its size.

Charts
 showing its route across the sky suggest the shooting star was 
travelling at about seven kilometres per second, and may have splashed 
down in the Bay of Biscay or the English Channel - meaning the chances 
of finding it are slim.

Adrian West, a member of online 
astronomy group Meteor Watch, said he had spotted the object in 
Berkshire, and that it had been seen as far south as Devon.

He added: 'It had a very bright orange nucleus and a green tail. It was seen by hundreds, maybe thousands of people.'

The meteor's appearance last night prompted a flurry of worried phone calls to the police, as people mistook the fireball for a burning plane.   

The Met Office tweeted: 'Hi all, for anyone seeing something in the night sky, we believe it was a meteorite.'

The Kielder Observatory also reported the sighting of a 'huge fireball' travelling from north to south over Northumberland.

The Observatory posted on Twitter: 'Of 30 years observing the sky, fireball best thing I have ever seen period.'

Meteors are particles from space that burn up in a streak of light as they enter the Earth's atmosphere, whereas meteorites are larger objects that survive the trip and reach the surface of the Earth.

Dr David Whitehouse, an author and astronomer, said the object was probably the debris of a planet that had never properly formed.

'It's a chunk of rock that's probably come from somewhere between Mars and Jupiter, and has been in space for thousands of millions of years,' he said.

'There are tens of thousands of bits of rock and grains of sand orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. Some of it comes out of that orbit and some of it hits the Earth.'

Amateur astronomer Graeme Whipps spotted the bright light while taking photos of the aurora in Chapel of Garioch, near Aberdeen.

Graeme, 48, who works as a meteorologist, captured the image with a Canon 40D, 15 second exposure.

He said: 'It looked like it was moving south or southwest, whilst brightening.'

Mike Ridley, an amateur photographer from Durham, managed to capture a stunning image of the meteorite against the backdrop of the 'Global Rainbow' - a laser display by artist Yvette Mattern installed in Whitley Bay to celebrate the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad in the north-east of England.

Mr Ridley, 49, a Quality Assurance Inspector for Nissan in Washington Tyne and Wear, said: 'I was standing with my friend when we saw a bright light in the sky moving really fast.

'I was there to photograph the laser show in Whitley Bay, but the light caught my eye so I turned the camera around.

'At first I thought it was a firework, then my friend said he thought it was a meteor or comet - I caught the white light and an orange glowing tail in my picture.

'I managed to capture the trail it left because I took my photo with a long exposure.

'The light was heading north to south. It lasted thirty seconds or more, It was really spectacular.

'We waited around to see if we would see anything else, but it was over very quickly.'

Hundreds of people took to Twitter to report where they had seen the shower and Adrian West, of Meteorwatch, said he had seen reports of sightings from Scotland to Devon.

He spotted the meteor in Berkshire and believed it could have gone down in the English Channel or the Bay of Biscay.
