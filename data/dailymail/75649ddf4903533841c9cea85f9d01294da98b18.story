A Connecticut teen who has been kept away from her parents for more than a year, recorded a desperate plea on Sunday asking Massachusetts Gov Deval Patrick and a judge to let her go home.

Lou and Lin Pelletier lost custody of their 16-year-old daughter Justina when doctors at Boston Children's Hospital diagnosed her with a psycholgoical disorder. The Pelletiers had been helping her get treatment for a different rare genetic disease at Tufts University before the conflicting diagnosis cast doubts on their parenting decisions.

She was finally released from Boston Children's Hospital early this year, where she was only allowed to visit with her parents for an hour weekly. However, Justina wasn't allowed to go home and has since been living at a residential treatment facility in Connecitcut.

Justina Pelletier recorded a video on Sunday, begging authorities to let her go home to her parents. She is currently in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families

On Sunday, she posted a passionate plea to Gov Deval Patrick and Judge Josephy Johnston to just let her go home where she can be with her friends and family.

'All I really want to be with is my family and friends,' Justina said. 'Right now - you can do it. You are the one that's judging this. Please let me go home Judge Johnson and Gov. Patrick please right now, please let me go home right now. I need to be home with my family. I know you can do it. Please right now, I need to be home right now.'

Mr Pelletier says he didn't force his daughter to record the video, and that it was an idea she had and created with one of her sisters.

Justina may get her wish, too. On Friday, the state filed a motion to close her case.

However, Mr Pelletier isn't getting his hopes up too fast.

'We have come to learn actions speak louder than words,” he told My Fox Boston.

The Pelletier's trying ordeal began 16 months ago when they submitted their daughter for evaluation at Tufts University hospital.

Lou and Lin Pelletier lost custody of their 16-year-old daughter when she was diagnosed with a psychological disorder last year. Before that diagnosis, they had been paying for her to get treatment for a rare genetic disease

Justina’s 
case has gained attention after a diagnostic dispute between her 
doctors at Tufts Medical Center and at Boston Children’s Hospital over 
whether her deteriorating condition was primarily a physical or a 
psychiatric problem.

She 
was being treated at Tufts for more than a year for mitochondrial 
disease, a group of genetic disorders that affect how cells produce 
energy, often causing problems with the gut, brain, muscles, and heart. 
However, doctors at Children’s hospital took a different view and 
concluded that her physical symptoms were primarily caused by psychological disorders.

After the 
conflicting diagnosis, doctors allegedly gave Justina's parents the bewildering and
heart-breaking news that they wouldn't be able to take their daughter 
home.

Justina was released from Boston Children's Hospital early this year, but has not been allowed to go home yet

Justina’s parents 
refused to accept that her condition was psychological in nature and tried to discharge her and bringing her back to Tufts.

Speaking
 of the moment their daughter was taken away from her, the teenager's 
mother said: ''They came in, and they said we cannot take Justina out of
 the hospital.

'They called DCF (Department for Children and Families).

'They said Justina had 'somatoform disorder,' a form of mental illness that is characterized by physical symptoms.'

Linda
 and her husband Lou Pelletier were escorted out of the hospital by 
security, and within the short space of four days they had lost custody 
of their beloved daughter.

'It's beyond any wildest nightmare that you could think of,' said the teenager's father.

'They
 told me that Mitochondrial Disease did not exist,' says Lou, a 
financial planner. 'Instead, they said she had Somatoform Disorder, 
which is effectively a stress-related mental problem.

'They
 said she had been misdiagnosed, overmedicated and forced to undergo 
unnecessary procedures. It was as though they were accusing us of 
needlessly harming our daughter.'

Mr Pelletier says the idea for the video was completely his daughters. She recorded with one of her sisters

Experts 
claim one in every 2,000 children in the U.S. suffer from Mitochondrial 
Disease, which saps energy, causes intestine and organ problems and gets
 progressively worse with age.

The
 disease is hard to diagnose and, according to the Mito Action support 
group, parents have been suspected of child abuse and sufferers accused 
of somatization disorders or fabricating pain.

Meanwhile,
 Somatoform Disorder is considered to be anxiety-related with sufferers 
feeling real pain that cannot be medically explained. Between 0.2 and 2 
per cent of females and 0.2 per cent of men in the U.S. have been 
diagnosed as sufferers.

Justina’s family insists she did not have Somatoform Disorder symptoms when she was admitted to Boston Children’s Hospital.
