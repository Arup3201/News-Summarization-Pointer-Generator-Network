American Eagle Outfitters has been accused of using a street artist's designs without permission.

Miami, Florida-based David Anasagasti filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging that his signature eyeball images appeared in the store' s spring campaign - including its advertising, billboards, store displays, social media and website - without any credit or compensation.

Mr Anasagasti, also known by the moniker AholSniffsGlue, is seeking actual damages, infringement-related profits and an injunction prohibiting further use of the artwork in question.

Artist's statement: Mr Anasagasti, pictured, is 'not painting for a corporation. He's painting because he loves it,' says his agent

'Given that he hails from the 
counter-culture world of underground street artists, Mr. Anasagasti's 
reputation as an artist has been founded, in part, on a public 
perception that (he) doesn’t "sell out" to large corporate interests,' 
the lawsuit stated.

MailOnline contacted American Eagle, and a spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Mr
 Anasagasti's murals depicting rows of sleepy eyes can be seen in 
Miami's Wynwood Arts District, where American Eagle's promotional images
 were allegedly shot. One of his works appears in the above portrait of the artist, shot by Giulio Sciorio.

One billboard shows a male model leaping over a fire hydrant in front of what appears to be Mr Anasagasti's  Ocean Grown mural, commissioned by Miami's Ocean Grown Glass Gallery.

'Ahol is not painting for a corporation. He’s painting because he loves it,' his agent, Gregg Shienbaum, told Reuters, adding that the trademark eyeballs were particularly inappropriate for retail marketing.

'They represent the working class, who struggle and are good people. They may look a little droopy, a little sad, but it's his way of saying, "You may be down today, but you've got to keep going,"' he said.

Anti-corporate: The lawsuit states that artist Mr Anasagasti's reputation was founded on a public perception that he doesn't 'sell out'

Mr Shienbaum told Miami New Times: 'People from all over the world who visit Wynwood see his mural on 27th Street, then come to the gallery to see his works. I have serious collectors from France, a TV producer from Los Angeles, and a businessman mentioned on Forbes' list of the world's wealthiest people who have seen that mural and been inspired by it to come in and buy one of Ahol's iconic works.'

A brief bio on Mr Anasagasti's website reads: 'Ahol, whose raw yet instantly recognizable street murals evaporate the divide between high and low art, often jumbles disparate themes from mass media, popular culture and marginalized pockets of society.'

'He often draws inspiration from the urban environment and systems of society which dehumanize its inhabitants. Ahol’s deceptively simple, yet complex renderings both portray the veneer of our everyday surroundings and the dull, job-related conflicts often encountered in a dysfunctional workplace.'

A court date for the lawsuit has not yet been set.
