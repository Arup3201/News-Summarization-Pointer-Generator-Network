Thousands of items that have been left behind by oblivious travellers at Sydney's airport will go under the hammer this week with all proceeds being directed to charity. 

From cameras and phones to bikes, ukuleles and even a blender – nothing is too unusual for the lost property auction that will take place online between November 4 and 14.

Tracy Ong, a spokesperson for Sydney Airport, told Daily Mail Australia that all of the 1500 plus items had been handed in as lost property from the T1 international and T2 domestic terminals.

A bicycle and a surfboard are amongst some of the stranger items to be auctioned off by Sydney Airport

The auction, which includes hundreds of phones, will take place online between November 4 and 14 

Over 1500 items were handed in as lost property from the T1 international and T2 domestic terminal in the last year

'They come from all over the place, but the main places where things are lost are in the food courts, at terminals and at security checkpoints where people forget things in the trays,' Ms Ong said.

The strangest items that will be sent off to a new home from this year's lost and found collection include a whipper snipper, a surfboard, a scooter, a bicycle, a blender, a microwave and a number of ukuleles and violins.

'There's a set off golf clubs, some brand new iPads, two four-litre tines of olive oil, two microwave ovens, two induction cook tops, three rice cookers, a range of designer shoes, sunglasses and perfumes and a coffee machine,' Ms Ong said.

However Sally Fielke, the general manager of corporate affairs at Sydney Airport, said the auction items also included a large amount of the usual cameras, tablets, phones and an array of jewellery.

A number of musical instruments, including violins and ukuleles, will also go under the hammer 

Tracy Ong, a spokesperson for Sydney Airport, said the most notorious spots where people forgot their things are food courts, at terminals and at security checkpoints

Up to 38 million people from around the world travelled through Sydney Airport over the last year

'Close to 38 million passengers travelled through Sydney Airport last year from all over the world and the items left at the airport reflect this diversity,' Ms Fielke said.

Ms Fielke said that last year's charity raised over $130,000 for the Salvation Army and the Australian Kookaburra Kids Foundation, which supports children living in families affected by mental illness.

'While we make every effort to reunite the thousands of lost items that are left at Sydney Airport each year with their owners, unfortunately hundreds of items are left unclaimed,' Ms Fielke said. 

Still in their packaging: Watches and jewellery make up a large proportion of the lost property items 

All proceeds will be donated to charities of the airport's choice. Last year's auction raised over $130,000 forthe Salvation Army and the Australian Kookaburra Kids Foundation

The first of the five auction categories - Cameras, iPods, docks, gaming consoles, games, various electrical items - will begin on Tuesday with bids starting from $1

'Last year, more than a thousand people attended the on-site auction and we're hoping that this year's sale will raise even more for charity,' Ms Fielke said. 

This year's auction will take place online from the Pickles Auctions website after an initial viewing at Milperra in Sydney's south-west on Wednesday.

The first of the five auction categories - Cameras, iPods, docks, gaming consoles, games, various electrical items - will begin on Tuesday with bids starting from $1.
