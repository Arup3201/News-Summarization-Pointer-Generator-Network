Brazil's loftiest teen is set to become the world's tallest bride after her compact fiancee popped the big question.

Aspiring model Elisany da Cruz Silva - who is a staggering 6ft 8ins tall - has been dating 5ft 4ins Francinaldo da Silva Carvalho for more than three years.

Despite a massive 1ft 4ins between them, Francinaldo had no problem increasing the distance by dropping to one knee after a romantic stroll along the beach.

With well over a foot difference between their heights, Elisany and Francinaldo have more difficulty than most couples kissing after becoming engaged

Brazil's tallest teen Elisany Da Silva accepts her new fiancee Francinaldo Carvalho's proposal on March 29, 2014 in Salinopolis, Brazil

The lovestruck pair have shared a small home in the Brazilian town of Salinopolis for one year and are hoping to soon hear the pitter patter of tiny feet.

Elisany is so stuck on having a child that she is willing to adopt if she does not fall pregnant soon - despite being only 18.

The youngster is worried that she may not conceive because of a form of gigantism that was caused when a tumour grew on her pituitary gland.

Despite this the couple are still looking forward to a long and happy life together.

Remembering the romantic proposal, Elisany said: 'I told him many times, 'do not ask me to marry you because my answer will be no' - I think that's what he was thinking.

'I was so nervous when I saw him there. I don't even know how I coped.'

Construction worker Francinaldo added: 'I have always wanted to go out with a tall girl and she came and fitted into that perfectly.'

Despite planning a long engagement, Elisany has already picked out her wedding dress

Elisany's height still draws stares, even in her hometown, but Francinaldo says the attention doesn't bother him and he is proud to show her off

The couple are planning on a long engagement despite Elisany already having a dress for the big day.

'We think how will the preparations for the wedding be, the church, the best men and bridesmaids,' added Francinaldo.

'We have taken just one step towards the wedding - which was me asking her to marry me.

'We are giving it some time to get it all in order.'

The newly engaged couple have not always seen eye to eye and Francinaldo had to work hard to get the ring on Elisany's finger.

'When we met I had already turned 16,' she said.

'I was still a bit childish and so I was just playing around with him for a while and I got so annoyed with him - as if he was a rival that I hated.

'I just didn't like him and wanted to hit him every time we met.'

But little Francinaldo has a big heart and remembers their meeting a little differently.

He said: 'The first time I saw her I went to get some bread and I noticed her from a distance.

'I checked her out and she also checked me out straight away.

'Then I just thought, "I need to be with that girl". I always found her beautiful.'

And the hate eventually turned to love for Elisany when she became jealous of Francinaldo's prowess with the ladies.

'He was talking to another girl and I was jealous,' she said.

'He intrigued me - I wanted to know more about him.'

Despite the pair being completely in love, not everyone is as happy about the new engagement.

Elisany's mother, Ana Maria Ramos, said: 'I don't know how this could happen - this proposal.

'It was a surprise - no-one was expecting it.

'In spite of everything she is still a very young girl with a lot ahead of her.

'She is sometimes a bit difficult to him but I've never seen him treating her badly.

'He has been an excellent person.'

Elisany still draws stares while walking down the street where she has lived her entire life and is often referred to as the giant girl.

Francinaldo said: 'I keep telling her to get out more so that people don't feel so curious about her.'When we go for a walk people keep staring saying 'look at that giant girl'.

'It really bothers me because people don't have the consciousness of thinking that she's also a human being.'

But despite drawing stares Francinaldo cannot wait to show off his new fiancie.

He added: ' am always boasting about being with her.

'Everyone thinks she is beautiful - my friends think she is beautiful.

'They always ask me to take her to meet them but she won't go because she's embarrassed.

'She is a person that is very different and I know I can make her happy.

'Our relationship is special because she understands me and I understand her.'
