A judge on Friday rejected a bid by Canadian doctors to force an aboriginal girl into chemotherapy treatment in a groundbreaking ruling that affirms the right to pursue traditional healing over mainstream medicine.

The decision allows the parents of the 11-year-old girl to pursue a course of cancer treatment rooted in their centuries-old native traditions, but critics warn the unproven treatment risks the girl's life.

Doctors at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, sued to have her placed in protective custody in order to force her into care after the family removed her from their care.

The Globe and Mail reports that, with chemotherapy, the girl - who been identified only as J.J. and is suffering Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - has a 90 to 95 percent chance of living.

Without it she will die. 

Government child protection services had refused to intervene, citing indigenous peoples' rights and concerns about splitting her from a loving family.

Doctors insisted that chemotherapy had a very high chance of curing her before she quit treatment in August after 10 days.

The girl's mother then took her to a commercial holistic healing center in Florida. 

'I cannot find that (the girl) is a child in need of protection when her (mother) has chosen to exercise her constitutionally-protected right to pursue their traditional medicine over the (doctors') stated course of treatment of chemotherapy,' Ontario Court Justice Gethin Edward was quoted as saying by public broadcaster CBC.

Another aboriginal girl whose parents pursued the same alternative treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is now reportedly critically ill.

Critics urged the McMaster doctors to appeal the ruling, while outside the court the family's supporters cheered.

'This is monumental,' said New Credit First Nations Chief Bryan Laforme. 

'It reaffirms our right to be Indian and to practice our medicines in the traditional way.'

The Ontario Children's Aid Society also applauded the outcome saying it will spare the girl the 'trauma' of being separated from her family during treatment.

In May, Makayla Sault, an Obijwa girl from the New Credit First Nation reserve, read out a letter in a YouTube clip about how chemotherapy was 'killing' her body and that she saw a vision of Jesus who told her that she was already healed.

Makayla was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January and suffered terrible weakness and nausea from the chemotherapy used to treat it despite anti-nausea medications.

She underwent 11 weeks of the chemo, which sent her cancer into remission.

'I have asked my mom and dad to take me off the treatment because I don't want to go this way anymore... I know that what I have can kill me, but I don't want to die in a hospital on chemo,' Mikayla says in the video.

During the two weeks respite from chemo, Makayla's parents started her on a different form of treatment, which has left her feeling 'awesome,' she says.

'I wish that the doctors would listen to me, because I live in this body and they don't,' she said.

It’s pure ignorance to think that Western medicine is the only answer,' First Nations healer James Carpenter, who claims to have successfully treated cancer, leukemia and other life-threatening illnesses, told CTV News.

'What medicine people do is they go to the spirit and ask that spirit and find a way within that person to help them,' said Carpenter, who works at the Anishnawbe Health Centre.
