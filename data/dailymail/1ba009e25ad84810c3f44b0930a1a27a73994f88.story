When it comes to criminals and the stupid things they do, this one is right up there.

A 26-year-old Minnesota man has been tracked down by police after leaving his Facebook profile logged in at a house he allegedly robbed.

Authorities say Nicholas Wig burgled a home in South St. Paul on June 19 and must have decided to use the computer before he fled the property.

But he forgot to sign out.

World's dumbest criminal?: 
Police say 26-year-old Nicholas Wig checked his profile from a home he broke into, and then he didn't log off

Owner James Wood returned to his home in South St. Paul, Minnesota, and found it ransacked. But an all-important clue was waiting on his computer

Nicholas Wig allegedly stole cash, credit cards and a watch from this address in St. Paul

Mr Wood said he came home to find someone had broken in via this window

When the owner, James Wood, arrived home and found his place had been ransacked, he reported it to police, CBS reported.

Missing was cash, credit cards and a watch, but he found a pair of jeans, a belt and some Nike tennis shoes.

Sometime later Mr Wood noticed a Facebook page on his computer he didn't recognize.

Realizing what must have happened, he shared a picture of Wig from Wig's profile.

Mr Wood announced Wig was a thief and shared his phone number, asking for anyone with information to call him.

He did not expect to get a text from Wig himself in the evening.

Prison: Wig has an extensive criminal record, including a second degree burglary conviction, a domestic assault misdemeanor and pending drug charges

The 26-year-old is believed to be a father. Here he is seen is a selfie from his facebook page, concealing his face with a bandanna

Good outcome: Homeowner James Wood said that if Wig didn't leave his Facebook open, police would probably never have found him

'I replied (saying) ''you left a few things at my house last night, how can I get them back to you?''' Mr Wood said.

Wig agreed to return to the house and pick up his things.

As Mr Wood saw him approaching, he called 911.

Wig was wearing Mr Wood's watch when police arrested him.

'World’s dumbest criminal,' Mr Wood said.

Wig faces up to 10 years in prison and $20,000 in fines if convicted.

He has an extensive criminal record, including a second-degree burglary conviction, a domestic assault misdemeanor and pending drug charges.
