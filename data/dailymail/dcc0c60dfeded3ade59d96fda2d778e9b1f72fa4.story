A car thief let his glow-in-the-dark disguise slip - by posing in it on Facebook.

Christopher Murray, 25, was known as the 'green skull man' after he sported a luminous Halloween mask to terrify his victims.

But when police found the mask dumped at the roadside following a knifepoint raid, they carried out DNA tests and trawled the social networking site for Murray's profile.

Christopher Murray was caught when officers found a picture he had posted on Facebook wearing his glow-in-the-dark disguise

Officers eventually found a picture of him posing on his profile page wearing the same mask and flicking V signs at the camera.

Today Lancashire Police released the photo of Murray as he began a five year jail term.

One officer said: 'The DNA evidence was clear cut but this man will feel a prize chump for posting a picture of himself posing with his own disguise for all the world to see. 

'It's an extremely distinctive mask and you would have thought he would be keen to keep it to himself - not splash it over the internet. It just goes to show the idiotic lengths some criminal will go to to brag about their crimes.'

The raid occurred on January 7 at 8pm when a 51-year old woman was returning to her £20,000 Mini Cooper after a shopping trip at Sainsbury's in Darwen, Lancashire.

Bolton Crown Court heard that Murray put on his mask and high visibility jacket then ambushed the woman as she put her shopping in her car.

He threatened her with a kitchen knife before demanding her keys but ran off when he couldn't start the car.

He ditched the jacket and mask but was linked to the crime when his DNA was found in saliva inside the mask.

It emerged he had targeted a couple on New Year's Day, who had parked their Peugeot 307 outside a Spar store in Bolton.

Murray, who has 32 convictions for 70 offences, was jailed for five years at Bolton Crown Court

The driver was inside the shop when Murray leapt into the vehicle and threatened the driver's wife, who was sat in the passenger seat, with a knife.

She fled and ran to her husband virtually 'unable to breathe' while Murray sped off in their car.

The vehicle was found in Darwen later with false registration plates.

Murray, who has 32 convictions for 70 offences, had only been out of jail for a few months when he was arrested.

In April 2012 he was jailed for 16 months after he knocked down and injured a firefighter while stealing a Saab from outside Darwen Fire Station.

Murray, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and possession of an offensive weapon and was also ordered to pay £120 in compensation.

In mitigation he claimed his latest crimes were 'a cry for attention' by the way he has been dealt with by the authorities in the past. 

But passing sentence the judge Mr Recorder John Bromley-Davenport QC said: 'These were serious offences with pre-planning, disguises used, they were at night and ladies were the victims in each case.'

Det Sgt Kathryn Cussans, of Lancashire Police, said: 'This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim who was left shaken and frightened by what happened.

'We treat any attack of this nature extremely seriously and will always carry out full and thorough investigations to identify those involved and bring them to justice.

'This should send a clear message to criminals who think they can get away with committing crimes such as this, that they will be caught and will go to prison.'
