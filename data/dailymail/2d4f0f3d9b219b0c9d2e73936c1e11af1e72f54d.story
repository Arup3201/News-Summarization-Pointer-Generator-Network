Inking: Helen Mirren's tattoo, which she has revealed is a symbol of tolerance

She first described it as nothing more than a drunken act of rebellion from her youth.

But Dame Helen Mirren has now revealed the significance of the tattoo etched on her left hand.

The pattern of interlocking Vs denotes ‘love thy neighbour’ among tattoo artists – and for the Oscar-winning actress it is a daily reminder of the importance of tolerance.

The star will next be seen in the film The Hundred Foot Journey in which she plays icy French chef Madame Mallory.

Produced by Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey, it is based on the best-selling novel by Richard C Morais and is set in the countryside around Toulouse in France.

It tells the story of the friction that follows when a culinary genius opens an Indian restaurant - Maison Mumbai - 100 feet from a Michelin-starred classical French establishment run by Madame Mallory.

The 68-year-old actress said: ‘I have a tattoo that means "love they neighbour" – even if your neighbour is as different from you as you can possibly imagine. The story of this film is in my tattoo.

‘But "love they neighbour" is by far the hardest of the commandments.

‘That’s where real hatred is bred. It’s the guy living next door who cuts the tree down, or the one whose kids scream the whole night.

‘Your neighbours are as important as your house. When you have great ones it’s incredible – they’re someone you can leave the key with when you travel.’

Dancer: Helen Mirren also spoke of her love of twerking, and how she is a fan of Beyoncé

Although born and raised in England, Dame Helen said she has never felt English – only British.

Speaking in an interview with Hello! she said: ‘Although I was brought up in Britain [Dame Helen was born in Hammersmith, London] I’m half-Russian as my father was born in Russia. When I’m in Russia, I feel that very strongly.

'Mad': Dame Helen said that 'only prisoners, sailors and Hell's Angels' got tattooed when she got hers

‘To be honest I never felt very English. Maybe British, but not just English.’

And Dame Helen’s tattoo is not her only nod at a liberal mind set, the star is also a huge fan of R’n’B singer Beyoncé and she loves to twerk: ‘It’s true, I’m a huge fan of Beyoncé and I do love to twerk. I love dance. I am mesmerised by it.

'It's unbelievable how they do it. I always like it when a new dance arrives on the scene.’

Asked if she had practised twerking in secret in front of the mirror, she replied: ‘I actually might have done that.’

In recent years Dame Helen has become best-known for her portrayal of The Queen both on the big screen and on stage prompting Prince William to joke earlier this year that he should probably call her ‘Granny’ when he presented her with a Bafta Academy Fellowship award.

Commenting on her tattoo in the past, Dame Helen said she acquired the tattoo when she ‘got very drunk’ while acting with an American Indian theatre group on a reservation in Minnesota.

‘About six of us got them at the same time,’ she added. ‘It’s a kind of mad bonding thing that you do from time to time in your life.

‘It was my little act of rebellion. It was done with a safety pin and was very painful.

‘I’ve never regretted it. But back then, only prisoners, sailors and Hell’s Angels got tattooed. Now it’s gone madly out of control.’

And despite now being married to director Taylor Hackford for 15 years, Dame Helen said she still did not believe in the union: ‘Not at all. I couldn’t see the point until a financial adviser told me how much money we would be saving. I was on board immediately.

‘As you get older, you start thinking about wills and planning for your estate. We realised it was going to be so much clearer if we got married.’
