Take a good look at this - because it is no normal house and these are not real climbers.

While it may look like a classic late-Victorian façade on an everyday street in east London, the front is actually a painstakingly-created visual illusion.

Argentine artist
Leandro Erlich put together the three-dimensional piece, which will open to the public in Dalston this week, using mirrors and a life-sized exterior of a terraced house lying on the ground.

The mirror is positioned at a 45-degree angle above the facade installation, meaning people can crawl all over it and appear to be climbing up the front of the house.

The house is fully decorated with windows, door, mouldings and other architechural details

The area's Victorian terraced houses were destroyed by Second World War bombing, and it has since remained largely vacant.

Visitors will be able to stand, lie, crouch or crawl on the 
meticulously-crafted surface, and look like they are scaling the 
building or falling off it.

Leandro Erlich is internationally known for his incredible creations.

Mr Erlich's work is inspired by the surreal and sinister aesthetic strategies
of Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch, Luis Buñuel and Roman Polanski.

His previous projects involving interactive spaces include a swimming
pool, a lift shaft and a revolving flat, all inviting viewers to 
stretch their notions of spatial reality.

Jane Alison, senior curator of the Barbican Art Gallery, said: 'We 
are thrilled to be able to present Leandro Erlich's work in the heart of
Hackney.

'Dalston House is a theatrical spectacle, one where the 
audience makes the show. It is a delightful experience suitable for all 
ages.'

The exhibition, part of the Beyond Barbican series, follows on from 
the 2009 Dalston Mill wheat-growing and bread-making project in what 
subsequently became the Eastern Curve Garden.

Mr Erlich's work is to be accompanied by a series of special events 
including film screenings, performances, tours and workshops all 
exploring themes related to the installation.
