This is the shocking moment a police officer shattered a man's eye-socket as he arrested him after he threw a paper cup out of a car window.

Mohaib Qurban was left with horrific injuries following the arrest in Birmingham city centre in March 2012.

A West Midlands Police officer is now facing a disciplinary hearing following the incident, the force has confirmed.

CCTV footage shows Mr Qurban being held to the ground beside a parked car as an officer appears to punch down towards him.

The footage, obtained by the Birmingham Mail, also shows Mr Qurban lifted into view before the same officer knees him in the head twice.

The trainee fork-lift truck driver, of Birmingham, also suffered cuts, a damaged jaw and needed counselling for post-traumatic stress disorder.

Mr Qurban's initial complaint to West Midlands Police was rejected, but his appeal to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was upheld.

The force has now confirmed the officer, who has not been named, is facing a new internal misconduct hearing.

The officer will not be prosecuted in court after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to proceed with the case following an IPCC referral.

Mr Qurban, who lost his job after taking time off to recover from his injuries, is now suing the force for compensation.

He said: 'I just want to see justice served. I want the officer to go through what I had to go through.

'I think he should face the courts like I had to face the courts and I think he should lose his job, like I did.'

Mr Qurban went on to say: 'I have been very patient and I have gone through all of the official channels, speaking with lawyers, the CPS, the police and the IPCC.

'But this officer is still out there on the streets and nothing seems to be happening. An issue like this just can’t be ignored.

'The IPCC upheld my complaint. They also found issues with pocket notes, CS gas and radio transmissions.

'I have no idea why he did it, maybe he just had a bad day, but whatever the reason was, it was not and never would be justifiable.'

Mr Qurban had been drinking vodka before his arrest while sitting in the passenger seat of his friend's car in the city's Dean Street.

He threw a paper cup from the car, only 
for it to be launched back into the vehicle and an officer appeared next
 to the window claiming there had been reports of a group acting in a 
drunk and disorderly manner.

Mr Qurban was then pushed against the bonnet of the car and he and his friends were sprayed with CS spray.

A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said: 'The IPCC complaint was upheld, but no criminal charges were brought against the officer.

'The internal force disciplinary procedures are still ongoing.'

The IPCC confirmed that they upheld Mr Qurban's complaint and sent the contents of its report to West Midlands Police.
