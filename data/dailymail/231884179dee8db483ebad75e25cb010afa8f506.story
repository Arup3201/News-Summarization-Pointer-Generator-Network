A former Giants player has been suspended by the UFC after he called a post-op transexual fighter a 'sociopathic, disgusting freak' in an online interview.

Heavyweight Matt Mitrone made the controversial remarks about Fallon Fox on MMAFighting.com's 'The MMA Hour' show on Monday.

Born a man, Fox, who competes for small Championship Fighting Alliance, has had hormone therapy to help her transition from male to female and in 2006 she underwent gender reassignment surgery.

The Florida State Boxing Commission has been reviewing Fox's license to determine whether she'll be able to keep fighting against women in the CFA's female tournament.

Mitrone, who played defensive line in the NFL with the Giants in 2002 and the Vikings in 2005 before switching to fighting, called her a liar because Fox failed to flag up that she was transgender to the commission or her opponents before entering the ring.Â 

She has, however, been cleared to fight, the New York Post reported.

'That is a lying, sick, sociopathic, disgusting freak,' Mitrione said on the program.

'And I mean that. Because you lied on your license to beat up women. That's disgusting. You should be embarrassed yourself. And the fact that Florida licensed him because California licensed him or whoever the hell did it, it's an embarrassment to us as fighters, as a sport, and we all should protest that.

'The woman that's fighting him, props to you. I hope you beat his ass, and I hope he gets blackballed and never fights again, because that's disgusting and I'm appalled by that.'

In the midst of the tirade, the show's host Ariel Helwani questioned why Mitrione kept calling Fox a 'he.'

'She's not a he. He's a he,' Mitrione argued. 'He's chromosomally a man. He had a gender change, not a sex change. He's still a man. He was a man for 31 years. Thirty-one years. That's a couple years younger than I am. He's a man. Six years of taking performance de-hancing drugs, you think is going to change all that? That's ridiculous.'

It took the UFC a matter of hours before they suspended Mitrione until further notice claiming they were 'appalled by the transphobic comments' that were 'offensive and wholly unacceptable.' They also launched an investigation into the remarks.
