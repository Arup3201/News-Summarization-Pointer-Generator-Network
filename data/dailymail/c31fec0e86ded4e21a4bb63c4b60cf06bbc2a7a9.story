Dr Michael Houlton is launching a legal bid to recover paintings he claims were looted from his family by the Nazis

A British doctor has launched a legal battle to recover masterpieces looted from his family by the Nazis that he believes form part of a $1 billion treasure trove of paintings discovered in Germany.

Dr. Michael Hulton, 67, is the great-nephew of Alfred Fleichtheim, a famous Jewish art collector whose galleries were ransacked after he fled from Berlin to London in 1933.

Now working as an anaesthetist in San Francisco, Dr Hulton told the Mail that his lawyers reached an agreement two years ago with Cornelius Gurlitt - the son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer who traded plundered works for the Nazis – after he tried to sell a painting once owned by Mr Fleichtheim for £720,000.

The painting – The Lion Tamer by Max 
Beckmann – had been given to the collector by the artist himself in 
return for 'living expenses.'

'I asked him at the time, "Are there any others?" We had no idea.’

It
 wasn’t until Sunday when Dr. Hulton’s relatives sent him a BBC report 
saying German customs officials had found 1,400 paintings in Guritt’s 
cluttered Munich apartment that he realised he may have discovered what 
happened to many more of his great uncle’s stolen collection.

Dr Hulton said he had not been contacted by the German authorities since the find last year.

He believes the hiudden cache of artworks it may contain other works by Beckmann.

Mr Flechteim also owned works by the likes of Picasso, Klee, Monet, Renoir and Matisse.

Sold: Dr Michael Hulton claims the painting The Lion Tamer by Max Beckmann, which Gurlitt tried to sell for £750,000 before the collection was discovered, belonged to his great-uncle Alfred Fleichtheim

‘My German lawyer is certainly very well known to the German authorities. At the very least it would have been courteous for him to have been notified.

'They say they don’t want any Tom, Dick or Harry to turn up but with all due rerspect we are no Tom, Dick or Harry.

'It is a matter of justice and family honour. It really hit a nerve. We will be making a formal application in Germany to remind Munich that we don’t consider the mater closed.

'I just wish my father was alive to see this, although he would be over 100 now.'

Remarkable: A painting from Henry Matisse called Sitzende Frau (Sitting Woman) - one of the previously unknown works found at Gurlitt's flat - is projected on a screen during a news conference in Augsburg. It is worth an estimated £50-£60million

Never-before-seen: A painting of Otto Dix called Selbstportrait Rauchend (Selfportrait Smoking)

Control: Hitler only liked classical art and held exhibitions of modern 'dissident' pieces to show German people what not to like. Many of those paintings that appeared in those shows have been found in Gurlitt's collection

Loot: American soldiers are pictured discovering one of Hildebrandt Gurlitt's enormous art stash during the war. Although they suspected him of dealing in Nazi art, they let him go
