Students at a Catholic school in New Jersey have not been punished for dressing up as a monkey and a banana to taunt black basketball players at a high school game.

The two Holy Spirit High School seniors screamed from the sidelines as their classmates played Atlantic City, whose team is mostly black.

Despite numerous complaints, both were simply issued with warnings.

Jay Connell, athletic director at Holy Spirit, told The Press Of Atlantic City: 'I am not going to kick anyone out of school or whip anybody.

'All I can do is apologize; I can't take it back.

'There is no punishment. The punishment is that it will be an event that will not happen again, and that is the punishment for Holy Spirit.' 

According to NBC, a female student was also involved in the skit dressed as a cowgirl, and Holy Spirit's starting five was also majority black.

Atlantic City's athletic director Anthony Nistico said: 'What I am appalled at is there are adults there that let this happen,' he said. 

He added that the boys also hid behind a shower curtain and jumped out in an apparent attempt to scare the opposing team as they played.

'These two students were allowed to walk into the gym in these costumes and with this shower curtain,' he said. 'What were the adults thinking? Where were the refs?'

Shockingly, a poll on the Press Of Atlantic City website found 50.3 per cent of people felt the students shouldn't be punished as many students dress up for the event.

Atlantic City beat Holy Spirit 54-53.
