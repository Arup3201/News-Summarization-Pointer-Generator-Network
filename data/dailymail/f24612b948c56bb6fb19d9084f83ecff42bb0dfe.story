A woman and her three young children were fortunate to escape with minor injuries after they were violently attacked by a stranger in New York.

The terrifying incident was captured by CCTV cameras and the video shows the man elbowing a child in the head and tossing another to the pavement.

NYPD said the violent scene unfolded after the man tried to sexually assault the mother in front of her children. 

The video shows a man carrying a child from the driver’s side of a car before confronting the 26-year-old mother, who is holding a one-year-old child in her arms.

The man and the mother are struggling near the rear passenger side door when he suddenly elbows the five-year-old child in the head, knocking him or her to the floor. 

With the mother attempting to intervene, the man pulls the child out of the backseat and tosses him or her to the pavement before climbing back into the car and driving off.

Police said the incident occurred in the early morning hours of 24 August in Queens after the mother and her children were picked up in Manhattan by a man who claimed to be a taxi driver.
