A toddler has little idea how drastically his life is going to change in a week’s time – both his parents are deploying to Afghanistan.

Frances and Andrew Johnson, both in the Marines, are ready for their deployment shortly after the New Year, but they are not sure their son Noah is.

They are one of 681 couples in the Marine Corps that have been deployed at the same time since 2011, according to CNN, they will be overseas for as long as 12 months.

The couple, from San Diego, shared their struggle to prep their son for their deployment with the cable network.

‘Mommy and Daddy are going to go to work for a while ... but we always come back for you,’ Ms Johnson has been telling him. ‘We always come back for you.’

When they parted at the airport recently, the young boy asked if he could go to work with her.

‘I started crying and told him that I wish he could come to work with me, but that I would come back to him like I always do as soon as I could,’ she said.

She then smothered Noah in hugs and kisses before walking away ‘as fast as she could.’

It did not have to be this way, they were not ordered to go to Afghanistan together, but Frances Johnson volunteered since she had not yet deployed during the six years she has been enlisted.

Her husband’s enlistment was scheduled to end soon, but he was offered a deployment that would come with a promotion.

‘I said this is kind of a sign. 'Hey, it's not time for you to go just yet. You still have a little more work in the Marine Corps,’ she recalled telling him.

So off they go to Afghanistan together while her parents in Colorado watch after Noah, they will not even get to spend Christmas together as a family.

Frances Johnson says she has received a good deal of backlash from people who learn of their decision.

‘Sometimes, people who find out that both of us are deploying, they kind of say backhanded comments like, 'Wow, you guys are so brave for leaving your son. I could never do that,’ she recalled.

'You know, I try to be so centered around my kids.' And it's like, 'OK, well, me, too, but this is my job,’ she said.

She told the network that, despite the negative reactions, her husband has supported her every step of the way.

‘It hurts, but my husband is very, very good about focusing on the positives, because I am very good at focusing on the negatives.’

All both parents are doing, she says, are focusing on when they come home.

‘I keep thinking about how I'll try to be as polite as possible, but I'll probably be running people over just to get to him.’
