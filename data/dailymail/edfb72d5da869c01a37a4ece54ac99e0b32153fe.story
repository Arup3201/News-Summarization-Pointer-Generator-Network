Never mind two peas in a pod, these apples are quite literally joined at the hip.

The unusual fruit consists of two apples that have latched on to one another from the side and grown together - creating a quirky mirror-image fruit.

From the bottom, a bridge-like structure can be seen - which appears to be joining the two together.

Odd: A homeowner found this strange conjoined fruit in his back garden

Joined: The two fruits appear to be joined by a strange bridge like piece of apple flesh

The fruit shares a single stalk, but has two cores and two sets of pips.

Homeowner Ned Sparham certainly got two for the price of one when he discovered the bizarre conjoined apple in his garden.

The keen gardener discovered the fruit 
lying metres from an apple tree near to his home
in Bromley, south east London.

Mr Sparham said: 'I'd been away on holiday and when I got back I found it [the apple] lying on the ground beneath the tree.

Conjoined: The fruit has one stalk, but two cores and two sets of pips

'I couldn't believe my eyes. In all the years I've lived here I've never seen such a strange looking apple.

When I spotted it, it was a real case of cor blimey!'

Mr Sparham decided the best thing to do with his conjoined find was to make a giant apple pie.

The gardener's find was not a first, however.

In 2010, another Siamese apple - with one fruit sprouting from the top of the other - was found in Slovakia by a farmer.

Good use: The homeowner who found the fruit, Ned Sparham, made an apple pie with his quirky discovery
