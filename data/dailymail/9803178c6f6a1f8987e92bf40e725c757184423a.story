An unemployed man who was desperately struggling to make ends meet has turned his passion into profit by selling his incredible nature photographs to support his family.

Justin Brosey has applied for more than 200 jobs since he became unemployed at the beginning of the year due to cuts at his previous job.

Along with his girlfriend and seven-year-old daughter, he lives in a 7x15ft trailer with no water, no electricity, no kitchen and just two little beds.
