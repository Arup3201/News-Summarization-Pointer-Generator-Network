It appears all Simon Cowell has to do to boost ratings of his UK version of The X Factor is appear on it himself for just a few minutes.

Sunday night's Boot Camp show was the most watched programme in Britain that day... and even notched up audience viewers to make it the second highest ratings of the series so far.

And it seems it could have been the addition of Cowell back on screens as he made a (very small) comeback.

He'll be happy! Simon Cowell is all smiles as he momentarily appears back on Sunday's X Factor... causing viewing figures to be given a boost

The music mogul hasn't been seen on Britain's The X Factor since he quit two years ago.

But on Sunday he must have pleased fans of the show as he made a return... although not on the judging panel as some would perhaps like.

He instead appeared looking relaxed as he phoned the current panellists, consisting of Nicole Scherzinger, Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos, from the comfort of sunny Miami during a break from filming the US version of the talent programme.

That's better: Sunday's show averaged at 9.4 million viewers, with it at 10.8 million at its highest - the second highest rating of the season so far

Cowell was seen smiling as he delivered news to the judges about which group of acts they would be mentoring and taking care of on this year's series.

And as a result an average of 9.4 million viewers, including those tuned into ITV1 and ITV+1, while it peaked at 10.8 million viewers at one stage.

Although it still failed to draw in the numbers it did from last season.

Meanwhile, Downton Abbey on ITV1 averaged around 8.4 million viewers, although that did mean it was down from the previous week's ratings and form its popularity a year ago.

It managed to notch up an average of 8.6 million viewers in its debut episode for the new series the week before.

The girls! Tulisa was seen squealing with delight as Simon informed her she'd be taking care of the females, consisting of Ella Henderson, Amy Mottram, Jade Collins, Lucy Spraggan, Leanne Robinson and Jade Ellis

The ratings statistics come as the final 24 X Factor contestants going through to the live show part of the programme have been revealed.

During Sunday's episode Tulisa, who is the reigning judge from last year, was seen jumping around with joy after the mogul informed her she would be looking after the females.

She gushed: 'Get in there. Thank you very much Simon, I won’t let you down.'

She added: 'Before, I said to myself there is no way I can win two years in a
row, never going to happen. But my category is so strong that it’s 
actually possible.'

Tulisa's
group includes 16-year-old Ella Henderson, Amy Mottram, Jade Collins, 
Lucy Spraggan, Leanne Robinson and Jade Ellis, who all wowed the judges 
with their vocal ability, originality and personality.

The boys: Nicole Scherzinger will be mentoring James Arthur, Jahmene Douglas, Nathan Fagan-Gayle, Adam Burrdidge, Rylan Clark and Jake Quickenden

Gary Barlow was given the over 28's, Nicole Scherzinger took the boys while Louis Walsh was handed the groups.

The Take That singer and writer seemed pleased with the mature group of singers and said: 'Oh wow. Brilliant! That is good news to my ears.'

'I feel like in recent years, the overs has become a bit of a joke 
category and I really want to restore what the overs should be this 
year. There are people over 28 with talent!’

The over-28s: Gary will be working with Kye Sones, Melanie Masson, Nicola Marie, Brad Shackleton, Carolynne Poole and Christopher Maloney

Gary will be working with Kye Sones, Melanie Masson, Nicola Marie, Brad Shackleton, Carolynne Poole and Christopher Maloney.

Nicole had expressed that she wanted the girl category but after being given the boys she said: 'I wasn’t expecting that. I’m stoked. I’m super stoked. I’m excited.'

The groups: Mitsotu, GMD3, Duke, MK1, Poisonous Twins, and Rough Copy will be taken care of by Westlife manager Louis Walsh

Overs:  Melanie Masson, Carolynne Poole, Christopher Maloney, Kye Sones, Nicola- Marie, Brad Shackleton

Boys: Jake Quickenden, Rylan Clarke, Adam Burridge, Jahmene Douglas, James Arthur, Nathan Fagan- Gayle

Girls: Ella Henderson, Jade Ellis, Jade Collins, Lucy Spraggan, Leanne Robinson, Amy Mottram

Groups: MK1, Union J (Formally Triple J), Mitsotu, Poisonous Twin, GMD3, Duke, Times Red

The former Pussycat singer will be mentoring James Arthur, Jahmene Douglas, Nathan Fagan-Gayle, Adam Burrdidge, Rylan Clark and Jake Quickenden.

Louis, who managed Westlife and Boyzone got the groups - a category he wasn't prepared for.

He said: 'I got the groups. I wasn’t expecting the groups. But I’m happy. I’m going to work hard, and yeah, it’s going to be great.'

When the judges deliberated over the 
groups they told five acts they had made it through before asking two 
bands to battle it out for the final place.

Mitsotu, Duke, MK1, Poisonous Twins, and Rough Copy all landed spots at the next stage of the competition but Gary Barlow told GMD3 and Triple J that they must battle it out in a sing off.

But diehard fans will know Rough Copy failed to make it to judges houses after member Kazeem Ajobe, 23,who was born in Nigeria, submitted his application for leave to remain in the UK which is being viewed by the UK Border Agency, but he left it too late and was unable to head to the judges' houses abroad.

He was told he would not be able to re-enter the UK.

Upset: Boyband Rough Copy were axed from The X Factor after one member failed to secure a visa

And there was more changes as Union J and Times Red were added to Louis' category while George Shelley added to Union J and the group was renamed Triple J.

Louis Walsh sad: 'When Rough Copy left, I found it difficult to choose between two groups to fill their place. In the end I invited boyband Triple J to come to Judges Houses, but still felt that as I’d lost such a strong group in Rough Copy that I wanted to make sure the category was the best it could possibly be. 

'I asked Gary, Nicole and Tulisa if they minded if I took a seventh act. They were happy as they felt they’d got the right six acts for their Judges Houses trips so I asked Times Red to come along and they said yes.'

She's happy! Tulisa Contostavlos was ecstatic when it was revealed to her by Simon Cowell that she'd be in charge of the girls this year to attempt to continue her reign as champion judge

They'll do! She originally wanted the girls but Nicole Scherzinger was happy to accept taking charge of the boys category
