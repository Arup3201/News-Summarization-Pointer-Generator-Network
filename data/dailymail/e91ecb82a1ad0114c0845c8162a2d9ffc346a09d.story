Re-arrested: Rolf Harris

Rolf Harris was yesterday  re-arrested on suspicion of new sexual offences.

He was questioned over  ‘further allegations’ made to detectives at Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree.

They arose after he was first revealed to be a suspect in the controversial inquiry four months ago.

The Met refused to discuss the nature of the allegations. But they are now believed to involve more than one complainant and cover a period of several years.

Police insisted that the allegations remain unconnected to paedophile Jimmy Savile, who sparked the Yewtree inquiry.

Neighbours said Harris, 83, has not been seen at his home in Bray, Berkshire, for several days.

The Australian-born star is the biggest name to be arrested as part of the inquiry into historic sex offences.

He was first questioned under caution when he attended a police station by appointment in November last year.

His original accuser is a woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by him when she was a teenager.

It is understood that he vehemently denies the allegations but has declined to issue a formal statement on the matter.

Harris is being dealt with under the 'others' strand, meaning the allegations have no link to shamed DJ Savile

Rolf Harris, 83, was pictured performing on Sunday at the Wickham Festival in Hampshire

Harris’s wife of 55 years is the Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes, 81.

The
artist and singer received a rapturous reception from fans when he 
performed on London’s South Bank and in Bristol this year.

Earlier,
a leaked email from his Sydney-based brother and manager Bruce Harris 
revealed the family’s frustration at the pace of police investigations.

Writing
to a friend, Bruce said: ‘This has been dragging on for nearly seven 
months. The Plod in the UK are certainly taking their time.

Rare public appearance: Harris performed at the Wickham Festival in Hampshire over the weekend, where he greeted fans with a loud 'G'day!' and became emotional as he thanked them for their support

'We’ve been 
advised by Rolf’s top-notch legal team to sit tight and make no 
comment.’

Others held 
as part of Yewtree include pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie 
Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis, publicist Max Clifford and comedian Jim 
Davidson.

A Metropolitan 
Police spokesman confirmed Harris was ‘further arrested on suspicion of 
sexual offences in connection with further allegations made to Operation
Yewtree.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
