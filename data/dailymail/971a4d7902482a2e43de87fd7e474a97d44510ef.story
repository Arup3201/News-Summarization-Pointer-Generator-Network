Ballon d'Or: Cristiano Ronaldo

Women's player of the year: Nadine Kessler

Puskas award: James Rodriguez 

Men's coach of the year: Joachim Low

Women's coach of the year: Ralf Kellermann

FIFA presidential award: Hiroshi Kagawa 

FIFA fair play award: FIFA volunteers

All three players shortlisted for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award were unsurprisingly selected by their peers to be named in the 2014 FIFPro World XI team.

Lionel Messi, Manuel Neuer and ultimate winner Cristiano Ronaldo were among seven 2013 team members who retained their places in worldwide voting by 23,000 members of national players' unions. 

Manchester United winger Angel di Maria was the only player in the XI that is currently plying his trade in the Premier League, although his selection will have been based on his performances for Real Madrid and Argentina last year.

Angel di Maria is only the third Premier League player in the last five years to be named in the FIFPro World XI - the others were Wayne Rooney and Nemanja Vidic, both in 2011.

Germany's World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm, Brazil captain Thiago Silva, and Spain pair Sergio Ramos and Andres Iniesta also stayed in the elite lineup. 

David Luiz was voted into the defense despite playing in Brazil's 7-1 rout by Germany in the World Cup semifinals, when Thiago Silva was suspended.

Still, the Brazilian pair was reunited for a second embarrassing loss, 3-0 against the Netherlands in the third-place match.

Arjen Robben was picked as the only player from the Dutch team which started the World Cup by routing title holder Spain 5-1. 

Toni Kroos completed the lineup as the third Germany player, and the fourth who played for Bayern Munich last year.

La Liga                                      5

Bundesliga                                3

Ligue 1                                      2 

Premier League                        1 

Germany                                   3

Spain                                         2

Argentina                                   2

Brazil                                         2 

Portugal                                     1 

Holland                                      1

As Kroos transferred in the offseason to join Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos at Real Madrid, the European champion also had four players in the FIFPro lineup.

Di Maria was a standout in Madrid's Champions League final victory, against city rival Atletico, before joining Manchester United. 

David Luiz was the other World XI player who switched clubs last season, moving from Chelsea to join Thiago Silva at Paris Saint-Germain.

Brazil failed to get a third player elected as there was again no place for Neymar. The star forward lost out to Robben in a three-man attack with Messi and Ronaldo, one year after Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the third forward elected.

The other 2013 team members who lost their places were Dani Alves, Xavi Hernandez and Franck Ribery.
