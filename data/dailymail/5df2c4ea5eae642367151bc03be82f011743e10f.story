Author Barbara Taylor Bradford has decided to help two distant relatives by selling her £1.5million collection of jewellery.

The 80-year-old author of A Woman Of Substance, who has no children, is to auction off her diamond rings, ornate brooches, dazzling necklaces and timeless bracelets - most of which were presents from her husband Bob.

She initially thought of giving the 40-strong collection to the two women, who are described as 'wider family members'.

Jewellery belonging to author Barbara Taylor Bradford goes on display at Bonhams showroom, this sapphire ring is expected to fetch £98,000 when its sold by the auctioneers later this week

A 19th century sapphire and diamond brooch from the collection is displayed and estimated at £65,000 - £75,000

But she came to the conclusion that the gems are not something they would want or wear ‘as they don’t lead the same lifestyle as me’.

A 14-carat diamond ring which will go under the hammer in the Bonham's December 5 sale, has been valued at almost £500,000 and a pair of Harry Winston diamond and pearl earrings is expected to fetch up to £75,000 in the sale.

Speaking about the collection, she said: ‘My
father told me when I was a child, after he gave me a string of pearls:
“You must always let them breathe. They should be out on your neck, not 
buried in a drawer.”

'Why was all this buried in a drawer? Well, I didn’t know.

‘Then I
realised I was going to leave that jewellery to two of our female 
heirs. They didn’t really want it, I don’t think, because they don’t 
really lead the kind of life that I lead as a well-known writer, and I’m
out and about.

‘So Bob
and I decided it might be nice to auction it and the money will be a 
little nest egg for them. Let somebody else enjoy those beautiful 
things.’

The collection forms part of Bonhams Fine Jewellery Sale on December 5 and has some dazzling pieces

Substance, who has no children, is to auction off diamond rings, ornate 
brooches, dazzling necklaces and timeless bracelets – most of which were
presents from her husband Bob (jewellery worn by model)

A cushion-shaped single-stone diamond ring of 14.07 carats is estimated to sell for £330,000-£460,000

Miss Taylor 
Bradford has said she does not want to disclose the identities of the 
two women.

A recent 
ITV programme, Secrets from the Workhouse, showed the author  
extensively researching her family history, while she was also shocked 
to learn in 2004 that her mother, along with aunt and uncle, may have 
been the illegitimate children of the Marquess of Ripon.

Yorkshire-born
Miss Taylor Bradford, who has sold over 88 million books in more than 
90 countries, said that most of the items were presents from her 
husband, a television producer with whom she celebrates her 50th wedding
anniversary on Christmas Eve this year.

‘I happen to have a very generous husband, and he’s really bought everything that is going on auction,’ she added.

A ladies diamond bracelet watch with approximately 26.90 carats by David Morris, London is estimated to fetch £55,000-£75,000

A pair of cultured pearl and diamond earrings owned by the author are expected to fetch £53,000, and the sapphire ring weighing 18.37 carats (estimated at £98,000-£131,000)

'I
did say: "Is that alright? Are you agreeing to this?" And he said "Yes,
of course. I bought it, but I gave it to you and it's yours and you can
do what you like with it".

'When
I look at those things and when I was going back in time, because we 
are coving the 80s and the 90s, a lot of the memories of how he gave the
piece to me sprang in to my mind.

'I
was very amused and very happy because I remember once for instance we 
were in vacation in Capri and I was reading on the terrace after 
breakfast and he said: "I'm just going for a walk to buy a newspaper".

‘A
little while later he returned with a large shopping bag full of 
newspapers. And then he suddenly reached in to the shopping bag and 
said: “I’ve bought you some flowers”. Flowers indeed! Sapphire, 
multi-coloured flowers in a necklace. He does things like that all the 
time.

‘It’s a wrench, 
but at the same time I’ve enjoyed those pieces and I’d had them for 
years and a lot of times they had remained in the safe. So, when you’ve 
owned beautiful things, and I still have quite a few beautiful things 
left, they should be in a safe. They should be being worn by another 
person, another woman.

‘The husband should be buying it for her. I don’t believe in buying your own jewellery if you’re a woman.’

Miss
Taylor Bradford and her husband have never had children. The couple 
have tried to start a family in the past, but the author has admitting 
having two miscarriages.

‘I 
had two miscarriages and never got pregnant again,’ she said. ‘But 
regrets are fruitless and you don’t miss a child you’ve never known. I 
would have liked a child; I didn’t have one. What am I going to do? I’ve
got Bob.’
