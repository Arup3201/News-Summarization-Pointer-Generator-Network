It is an image which captures one of the most crucial moments in our recent history.

This extremely rare signed group photograph shows UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D.Roosevelt at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 with their military leaders.

Historical: A very rare signed group photograph of Winston Churchill, Franklin D.Roosevelt and the British and American Joint Chiefs of Staff taken at the January 1943 Casablanca Conference is for sale next month

It was announced today that the 
revealing picture will go on sale in London next month with an estimated
price of between £15,000 and £20,000.

The Casablanca Conference preceded a trio of wartime conferences attended by the leaders of America, Britain and the Soviet Union.

Known as the Big Three, the first of these was the Tehran Conference in November 1943 in which Roosevelt and Churchill travelled to Iran to meet with Joseph Stalin.

The central aim of the Tehran Conference was to plan the final strategy for the war against Nazi Germany and its allies, and the chief discussion was centered on the opening of a second front in Western Europe.

The Yalta Conference was held in February 1945 at the Livadia Palace in the Crimea.

Its main purpose was to discuss Europe's post-war re-organisation.

As the meeting finished, a final plan for the occupation of Germany was agreed upon and Roosevelt obtained Stalin's word that the Soviet Union would participate in the new United Nations.

The final meeting of the Big Three was the Potsdam Conference in summer of 1945.

The meeting was also attended by Clement Attlee as the UK was awaiting the outcome of the general election. Harry Truman attended as the new US President following Roosevelt's death in April.

One of the main objectives was to decide how to administer punishment to the defeated Nazi Germany.

The other principal goals of the conference were to begin designing the postwar world and negotiating treaties.

Only three other photographs jointly signed by the two wartime leaders are known.

It was at the Casablanca Conference that
the Allies took the crucial and far reaching decision to demand 
unconditional surrender from Germany and the Axis Powers.

Militarily, it also resolved the long running and sometimes bitter dispute between the Allied commanders over strategy.

While Roosevelt and Churchill enjoyed a good personal relationship there was little love lost between some of the other participants at the conference.

The Americans military leaders, in particular, felt that the British had been dragging their heels over the invasion of mainland Europe in favour of an invasion through Sicily and on into Italy.

The Casablanca Conference resolved this dispute in Britain’s favour.

The successful invasion of Sicily took place in July and August 1943 with the invasion of France following in June 1944.

Notably absent from the conference was Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who stayed
in Russia due to the raging battle of Stalingrad, which by that point 
the communists had nearly won.

And so, as Red Army soldiers 
finally began to roll back the Germans on the Eastern Front, the 
conference marked the turning point for the Allies in Western Europe.

Roosevelt presented the results of the conference to the American people in a radio address on February 12, 1943.

The photograph shows Churchill and Roosevelt seated in the garden of the Anfa Hotel, Casablanca, with, standing behind, Lieutenant-General Brehon B. Somervell (head of US Army Services of Supply), General H.H. Arnold, Admiral Ernest J. King, Lieutenant-General Sir Hastings Ismay (Churchill’s Chief of Staff), General George Marshall (directly behind Roosevelt), Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound, General Sir Alan Brooke (directly behind Churchill), Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal and Commodore Lord Louis Mountbatten (Head of Combined Operations).

Only Lord Mountbatten did not sign the photograph.

It is for sale at Bonhams Books, Maps, Manuscripts and Historical Photographs Sale on November 22.
