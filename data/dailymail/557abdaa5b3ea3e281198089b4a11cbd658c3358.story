Researchers found that those in weight loss groups sought support during the beginning of the regimes

We all feel good when we shed a few pounds – but a little known side-effect is that we can lose friends at the same time.

A study of weight loss groups found members are very supportive of each other at the start. 

However, as they become thinner they get more competitive and chilly towards their fellow slimmers, according to research yesterday.

Instead of passing each other dieting tips and meal plans, they begin to keep their secrets to themselves at the weekly weigh ins and group discussions, it added.

Researchers from universities including Stanford and Texas in the States and Peking University in China, looked at how members of a Weight Watchers group behaved.

In the early stages new members would turn up feeling fat and with a lack of confidence about how they would progress so they sought support from others in the group.

This leads to groups becoming mutually supportive, cheering each other on when they drop a pound or two on the scales and sharing ideas and tips about weight loss regimes.

But as an individual gets closer to the target they had originally been set, they gain in confidence and become more competitive.

They no longer feel they need the support of others as much as they used to, said the study for the Journal of Consumer Research, and so become distant and reclusive.

As a result, they even become secretive and selfish, keeping any new weight loss advice or strategies to themselves and not passing them on.

But this could become a problem as many people with an addiction, not just regarding weight, often give up if they do not get the support of others in a similar situation.

The bonding and friendship that helped the overweight members at the beginning slowly dissolves as individuals begin to see the pounds drop off, said the report.

The authors wrote: 'When consumers start working toward a goal, they often feel uncertain about how to achieve the goal and see others at a similar stage as friends.

'They pass on helpful tips and cheer each other on.'

As individuals lost weight and grew in confidence, they believed they don't need support from others and become distant

It added: 'But once the goal is in sight, consumers feel more certain and believe they don't need support from others, so they become distant and keep useful information to themselves.'

In the Weight Watchers group studied by the researchers, every single member interviewed at the beginning talked of how they helped and got help from others.

But by the advanced stage of their weight loss regimes, only 42 per cent said they were helping other members and 79 per cent said they were reluctant to share information.

This can present a problem not just in Weight Watchers but any group that relies of mutual support, including Alcoholics Anonymous and other addiction-based organisations.

The authors of the report wrote: 'As consumers move from the early stages of pursuing a goal to a more advanced stage, they change from being friendly to decidedly distant.

'And the more consumers distance themselves from others with similar goals, the more likely they are to feel disengaged and even give up on their goals entirely.'
