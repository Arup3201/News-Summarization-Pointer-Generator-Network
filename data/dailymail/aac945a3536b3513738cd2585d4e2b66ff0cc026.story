A mother has accused a private girls' school of 'barring' her daughter while she was recovering from anorexia because they feared she might inspire 'copycat' cases. 

Lottie Twiselton, 16, has spent the last two years battling with the severe eating disorder - enduring a year in and out of hospital as her weight plummeted to just six stone.

But when it came to rejoining her classmates at the fee-paying Northamption High School to finish her GCSE studies, she was told her inclusion 'would be too disruptive', according to her mother. 

Accusation: Claire Twiselton and her daughter Lottie have accused Northampton High School of 'abandoning' the 16-year-old because of her eating disorder

Support: Claire and Lottie Twiselton said they were devastated when they were told the 16-year-old could not rejoin her friends at Northampton High School

'Without a doubt one of the main 
reasons Lottie was not allowed back to school was because she was 
someone who lots of people looked up to. In the head teacher's eyes, she
 may well have inspired copycat disorders,' Claire Twiselton told the Times.

Lottie left the school to get intensive treatment for her disorder from a specialist London clinic after developing the potentially lethal disorder aged 14.

After being discharged from hospital last year, she had hoped to go back to school on a part-time basis until she fully 
regained her strength. 

But
 her hopes of fitting back into school life were dealt a blow when the 
school said it did not want her to return until she was well enough to 
come back on a full-time basis.

Barred: Lottie Twiselton nearly died from anorexia which she developed when she was 14 but was asked not to return to her old school until she had fully recovered

Lottie, who is now a pupil at Quinton House School, in Upton, said the rejection was devastating.

Describing
 the upset at not being able to immediately rejoin her friends, she told
 the Northampton Chronle: 'I was very upset about it. I almost died and 
without the support of my friends I would not have pulled through.

Alumna: Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller, former Director General of MI5, is a former pupil of Northampton High School

'I
 was completely ready to go back and be with them and just get back to 
normal but I was told the school weren’t able to have me back. It would 
have given me such a boost to my progress.'

Lottie's father, Robert, 46, who divorced from her mother several years ago, has also attacked the school - whose past
 pupils include Baroness Marcia Matilda Falkender, former private 
secretary to Harold Wilson, and Baroness Manningham-Buller, former 
director general of MI5 - over its treatment of his daughter.

He said: 'The school's response to Lottie coming back was pretty poor. People
 suffering from anorexia are encouraged to work towards a particular 
goal and Lottie was working towards getting back into school and to be 
with her friends.

'This was
 all taken away from her when the head teacher made it clear she was not
 welcome back. Lottie has shown remarkable courage and determination to 
get this point.

'Anorexia, particularly amongst teenage girls is not as uncommon as people think and schools need to be aware of that.'

Mr Twiselton told how he feared the eating disorder would kill his daughter at one stage.

Upset: Lottie Twiselton says she was distraught at not being able to rejoin her classmates

Exclusion: Lottie Twiselton said she was devastated when she was told she could not rejoin her classmates

'At its worst, we thought this might be it for Lottie. She needed to be forcibly fed through a tube and she went from a happy, healthy teenager to nothing at all.

'Claire and I divorced a few years ago and we have considered whether this had an impact on Lottie.'She
 became obsessed with her weight and appearance. She would look at 
pictures of celebrities in magazines and on the internet and was 
convinced she was fat and ugly.'

The school has rejected the criticism 
leveled at it by Ms Twiselton and disputed the version of events given by the pupil's mother.

Rebuttal: Northampton High School, left, and headmistress Sarah Dixon, right, have refuted the Twiselton family's version of events and said pupil health and wellbeing was 'at the heart of everything we do'

A
 statement issued by the school said: 'The
 school responded to say that they were very keen to support Lottie’s 
integration but remained of the view that it would be preferable to wait
 until Lottie was well enough to return on a full-time basis. 

'The health and wellbeing of our pupils is at the heart of everything we do... The professional view of the head and her team was that an interrupted part-time programme in a crucial year would not be in the interests of Lottie’s welfare or education.

'To say that Lottie was excluded is simply not true as is the assertion we were concerned about copycat issues.

'In school our approach is very pro-active and open in talking about and raising awareness of such issues through a variety of means including PSHCE lessons, tutorial support, extra-curricular sessions where guest speakers address the girls and parent talks/workshops, as well as having a full time nurse and the services of a school counsellor.'
