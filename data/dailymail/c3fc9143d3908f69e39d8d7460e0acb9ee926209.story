A mother of three screamed: 'Where are my children? Take me to them' after they died in a house fire that also killed their grandmother and aunt, her family has said.

Razia Nazim escaped the Sheffield blaze 
that killed her nine-week-old baby and two sons Amaan, seven, and 
Adhyan, nine, at just after midnight.

Their father Nazim Parvaiz had been out 
working as a taxi driver but rushed home to find his young family had died.

The children's grandmother Shabina Begum, 54, and aunt Anum Parvaiz, 20, were also killed after fire ripped through a terraced house in Wake Road, Sharrow overnight.

Mrs Begum had initially escaped the fire only to go back inside and died trying to save her trapped family.

Tragedy: The burnt-out Sheffield house where three children, including a baby, and two women died overnight

Investigation: The fire service are currently probing how the blaze started, while police have cordoned off the house

Distraught relatives
 have said the deaths are a 'tragedy beyond description' because 'within
 five minutes five precious lives were lost... and a whole family was 
destroyed'.

The cause of the fire is being investigated, South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue has said, but neighbours believe the fire started in the kitchen.

But a neighbour, who does not wish to be named, said the fire through a window of the terraced property and called the fire brigade.

Cousin Ishfaq Hussain Kayani said: 'The mother has been frantically crying, "Where are my children? Take me to them now". She is inconsolable.

'The
 family and the community have lost a wonderful sister, a grandmother, 
an aspiring university student and three gorgeous children, who had 
their whole lives ahead of them.

'The
 whole family is still in a state of shock. We have tried to comfort the
 children's mother, father and their grandfather. They cannot come to 
terms with what has happened, that five people have now left this 
world'.

Bereft: Cousin Ishfaq Hussain Kayani said today 'in a matter of minutes the whole family has been destroyed'

'It's just a huge tragedy. Words cannot describe how sad this is. It's a tragedy beyond description.

'The whole family is in a state of shock, devastated. The whole community is in a sombre mood.

'Friends, relatives, we're all in huge, huge shock. It's a tragedy beyond imagination.

'Just in a matter of minutes the whole family has been destroyed. The whole family has gone.

'You can well imagine what the children's parents are going through. I don't have the words to describe how the family is feeling, other than shell-shocked, devastated.

'We are a close-knit family, there are enough people around to support the family.

Mr Hussain Kayani said of his cousin, Mrs Begum: 'She was, to my children, like a mother, like an aunt.

'The whole community is in huge shock.'

Asked about the children, Mr Hussain Kayani said: 'They were full of life, quite bubbly, very energetic. They were looking forward to attending school (after Easter).'

He said the children's mother 'is in a state of shock. She's beyond consoling, really. I just hope and pray that they recover from this tragedy.'

Three generations of the family were killed in the fire.

Mr Hussain Kayani said: 'I believe the mother of the children, I think she was in the house.

'She managed to escape. The grandmother of the children, she made attempts to rescue the children but obviously it wasn't to be.

'She came out then went back in, tried her level best. Frantic attempts were made to rescue the children.'

Asked about Mrs Begum, he said: 'She was so caring, so generous.' He said her daughter, Anum, was a student.

The house where five people, including three children, have died in a house fire in Sheffield

Location: The road, lined with cars on each side, was cordoned off by police tape this morning and neighbours said they fear a baby has died in the blaze

Qurban Hussain, Labour councillor for Sharrow, said: 'I have known the family for the last 40 years. They were a very kind, loving and peaceful family.

'I came down last night when I heard about what had happened. When I saw the fire, I didn't think anyone would have survived.

'The smoke alarms were going off and the neighbour heard them and called the fire brigade. The neighbour was banging on the door, shouting, and that seemed to wake the family up.

'The grandmother came running out of the house, but when she realised the children were still inside she went back in to try and get them out.

'The children's father and grandfather are both taxi drivers and they were both out working at the time. They are very hard working and they're always out earning money for their family.

'They weren't there so they couldn't do anything to help.

'It is such terrible news. They were such a peaceful, loving family and they were very kind people. They didn't interfere with anyone else and they were very nice and loving.'

Stuart Jones, head teacher at Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield, where two of the children who died in a house fire studied, said: 'Both boys were very dear to us, and they had many friends here, having been together as a year group for some years.

'They had a sparkle in their eyes and most often a smile on their faces. They brought joy and a liveliness to our school and everyone who worked with Amaan and Adyan enjoyed doing so.'

Four fire engines were called to the scene and an aerial ladder was also used to tackle the blaze.

Police and ambulance services also rushed to the house after receiving emergency calls.

Phil Shillito, South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue area manager, said 25 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze.

'This is a tragic reminder of the devastating effects of fire and our thoughts are with the families of those involved in this incident,' he said.

'I can confirm that around 25 firefighters and four appliances attended a very challenging incident last night and worked hard to recover and rescue five casualties from the premise. Unfortunately, they didn't survive and we're now working with the police to investigate the cause of fire.

'They were faced with a very challenging fire, lots of flames coming out of the property, and they were aware family members were in the premise and they went in wearing breathing apparatus enabling them to breathe in the hot and smoky environment.

'Unfortunately they did find five casualties in the property'.
