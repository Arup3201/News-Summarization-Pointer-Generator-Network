River Plate defeated arch rivals Boca Juniors 1-0 to progress to the final of the Copa Sudamericana in a typically feisty match which saw a pitch invasion and a sending off.

The first-leg of their semi-final ended goalless last week, leaving the contest at the Estadio Monumental finely poised.

Boca Juniors missed an early penalty before River Plate took the lead through Leonardo Pisculichi. Boca couldn’t respond and River Plate held on to take on Colombia's Atletico Nacional in the final.

Just like the first-leg, the feisty encounter produced nine bookings as the Buenos Aires rivals attempted to secure the valuable victory.

Almost immediately from the kick-off, Boca Juniors went on the attack and were awarded a penalty after River’s Ariel Rojas was adjudged to have taken down Marcelo Meli instead of the ball.

Emmanuel Gigliotti delayed his spot kick after River fans shone lasers into his eyes from the crowd. The wait can’t have helped as the striker’s penalty was easily palmed away by goalkeeper Marcelo Barovero.

River took hold of the game and managed to take the lead after 16 minutes. Leonel Vangioni surged down the left and Boca failed to clear his attempted cross.

The ball fell kindly for Leonardo Pisculichi who hit a precise first-time shot low into the corner of the net.

Tempers flared throughout the contest and with time running out for Boca in added time, Daniel Diaz was sent off for kicking out at Teofilo Gutierrez off the ball.

The final whistle cued chaotic scenes as the River Plate squad commenced celebrating but the despondent Boca players had to fend off their own supporters who managed to invade the pitch.
