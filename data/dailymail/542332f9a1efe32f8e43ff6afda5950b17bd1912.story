Former Today host Meredith Vieira is set to make TV history as she replaces ailing Bob Costas on Friday night's prime-time Sochi lineup tonight, becoming the first woman to anchor NBC's Olympics coverage solo.

Legendary sports broadcaster Costas continues to battle an eye infection that has affected him from the start of the games and has now spread to both his eyes, seriously impairing his vision.

Matt Lauer has filled in Costas since Tuesday - the first time since 1988 Costas did not host NBC's primetime Olympics coverage, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

On Thursday Olympics executive producer Jim Bell told Today.com: 'Bob’s eye issue has improved but he’s not quite ready to do the show.

Meredith Vieira becomes the first Meredith Vieira will become the first woman to ever anchor NBC's prime time Olympic coverage on Friday night. Vieira is taking over for Matt Lauer, who has filled in for the last three days as Bob Costas continues to deal with the effects of an eye infection

'If your eyes are sensitive to bright lights, a TV studio is not the place to be.'

Vieira, 60, who co-hosted the Opening Ceremony with Lauer last week, and has been in Sochi doing segments for TODAY, said she was honored to be chosen as Costas' replacement.

'It's an honor to fill in for him,' Vieira told TODAY on Friday.

'You think about the Olympics, and you think the athletes and then Bob Costas.'

In an interview with Ryan Seacrest on Thursday, Costas said he hopes to be able to return to the desk by the second half of the games.

'In sports, there's a term that they use for people who are on the injured list -- they say, 'He's day-to-day.' And I am day-to-day,' he said.

'I'm hoping that I'm back by the weekend, and I certainly think I'll be able to do the second half of the games.

'The virus, they tell me, won't run its course for two or three weeks, but the symptoms will crest at their worst and start to get better pretty soon.

'As soon as the symptoms get to the point where I can be in the studio, I'll be there.'

Costas confirmed that the infection was interfering with his vision and exacerbated by studio lights.

'It got to the point my vision became so blurry and sensitive to light, I can't even be in regular room light, let alone studio light. I couldn't be of any use to them.'

Vieira is the first woman to do so solo for the network in primetime.

Lauer said she's a perfect fit.

'Meredith's fantastic, she'll be great, she really will, and I know she's going to have a blast. It's fun!' he said.
