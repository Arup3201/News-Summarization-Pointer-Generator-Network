Interview: A former children's TV presenter arrested by Jimmy Savile sex probe detectives has 'spent Christmas at a private psychiatric clinic'

A TV star questioned by police investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal spent Christmas in hospital amid fears for his mental health.

The man, in his 80s, was admitted to a Priory clinic for treatment for acute stress after being told of the allegations against him.

The children’s TV presenter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was interviewed last month under caution as part of Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree.

It is understood that medical staff at the £7,000-a-week clinic are watching him around the clock over fears he may harm or kill himself.

A source close to the showbiz veteran told the Sunday Mirror: ‘He decided to seek treatment as everything has been very difficult since the police got in touch.

‘He’s adamant he has done nothing wrong. But that does not stop this being an incredibly stressful time.

'This would be a harrowing experience for anyone – let alone a man in his 80s. He is in a bad way, his family and friends are deeply concerned for his wellbeing.

‘Nobody close to him is taking any risks, he is a very ill man at the moment so is being treated at the highest level.’

Scotland Yard opened an inquiry after a TV documentary provoked a flood of claims from victims of Jim’ll Fix It star Savile, who died last year aged 84.

The BBC and other institutions, including several hospitals, have come under fire for failing to challenge the DJ’s predatory behaviour.

Detectives have arrested eight male stars from the 1970s and 1980s on suspicion of sex attacks.

The celebrity receiving treatment at The Priory was interviewed under caution at the end of November before being released.

Several days before, police had raided
his multi-million-pound Home Counties home. Scotland Yard says the 
interview was not directly linked to Savile, who is suspected of abusing
more than 400 victims.

The celebrities questioned include convicted paedophile Gary Glitter, comic Freddie Starr and former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis.

Glitter, 68, real name Paul Gadd, was arrested on October 28 on suspicion of sex offences and bailed.

Starr, 69, was held four days later 
over a claim he tried to molest a 14-year-old girl in Savile’s BBC 
dressing room during the 70s.

Two weeks later Lee Travis, 67, was 
arrested at his home. The star, who insisted the allegations were 
‘nothing to do with children’, was bailed until next month.

Others arrested as part of the 
Yewtree investigation include PR guru Max Clifford, former BBC 
television producer Wilfried De’ath and former BBC producer Ted Beston.

Beston, 76, is accused of molesting young women and procuring young girls for his close friend Savile while working at Radio 1.

Police are examining 31 allegations 
of rape against Savile and said 589 people have come forward with 
information relating to the scandal.

A total of 450 complaints have been 
made against the DJ himself, mainly alleging sexual abuse. His crimes 
took place in 17 separate forces.

Two weeks ago an inquiry found chaos and confusion gripped the BBC after it abandoned a Newsnight report into Savile’s crimes.

Former Sky News chief Nick Pollard 
attacked the corporation for its ‘complete inability’ to deal with the 
fall-out of the controversial decision.

He said the Savile investigation 
ignited a ‘disastrous’ chain of events which led to the ‘one of the 
worst management crises in the BBC’s history’.
