Sally Pearson’s renowned tunnel vision has delivered a scintillating run at the Commonwealth Games, a day after an explosive attack on her that led to Australia’s athletics coach being sent home.

Eric Hollingsworth was booted from the Games after claiming Pearson had set a 'bad example' to teammates by skipping a pre-Games camp.

The Olympic champion let her feet do the talking this morning, clocking 12.69 seconds to smash her rivals in her 100m hurdles heat.

'It was so good, I’ve been so stressed,' Pearson said afterwards.

'I haven’t had a great season, I hurt my hamstring and every single week has been a hard slog getting back here.'

Pearson refused to directly address the furore surrounding Hollingsworth, but admitted it had been a 'huge distraction'.

'I’m in a good space at the moment and I just want to keep going,' she said.

'I know I have a reliable team. I’ve been supported since 2013... and I’m just so happy to deliver today.'

Australia will have a full complement of three competitors in the final after Michelle Jenneke (13.33) and Shannon McCann (13.34) also advanced.

McCann finished second in her heat, while our world famous dancing hurdler, Jenneke, finished fourth, a mere one hundredth of a second behind the third placegetter.

Jenneke delighted fans with her traditional pre-race dance routine, but looked set to miss the final after hitting her first hurdle and being forced to storm home.

England's Tiffany Porter also won her heat, but in a much slower time of 12.84.

Porter is likely to be the main challenger to defending champion Pearson in the final on Friday (Saturday morning AEST).

Canadian Angela Whyte won the slowest of the three heats in 13.33.

Australian Commonwealth Games Association chef de mission Steve Moneghetti announced at a press conference on Thursday morning that Hollingsworth had been stripped of his accreditation and would travel back to Australia at the earliest opportunity.

Moneghetti said: 'There was a breach in our team agreement with one of our members of the team, specifically the head coach of the athletics section.'We invited that person in to explain that breach in the contract and we decided that there was reason enough to impost some sanctions on the actions taken by Eric Hollingsworth and we then spoke to the section manager from athletics to decide on an appropriate sanction.'As a result of that Athletics Australia withdrew Eric's nomination as head coach of the athletics section of the Australia's Commonwealth Games team and this led to us revoking his accreditation. We've made arrangements for Eric to travel back to Australia at an appropriate time.'He is going home today, if we can get some flights arranged. He will leave the Games in Glasgow as soon as it's logical and possible.'
