An Arizona couple have tied the knot in a unique wedding ceremony held on the main stage at their local state fair.

Dereck Mast and his new wife Rhonda, who attend the Arizona State Fair every year, exchanged vows in front of a group of friends, family members and several bemused fair-goers and even danced their way off the stage after saying 'I do', much to the amusement of their guests.

'We wanted a carnival theme so I thought I'd talk to the fair and see if we could do it here,' Rhonda told AZ Family shortly after the ceremony.

'We just love the energy of the state fair, all the lights, all the people, everything that's going on so this is where she wanted to have it so I said let's do it,' Dereck added. 

'There's a saying in life - gentlemen you will know this well - happy wife means a happy life and what she wants to do, let her do it and things will be great and quiet in the house.'

The couple, who have been together for ten years, spent two years planning the unique celebration and eagerly embraced all aspects of the carnival theme. 

Both Rhonda and Dereck came up with a number of personal touches to ensure that they would remember their day forever.

While the bride carried a traditional bouquet, all 10 of her bridesmaids opted to forgo their flowers in favor 'bouquets' of traditional pink cotton candy.

Not to be outdone by the bridesmaids, the groom took to center stage during the ceremony and serenaded his wife with one of the couple's favorite Johnny Cash songs - before the couple danced their way into the waiting crowd, offering high fives to the friends and family as they went.

Following the ceremony, the Rhonda and Dereck invited their 175 guests to join them at a reception, where they were served a selection of traditional fair foods, including corn dogs - and perhaps even the cotton candy bouquets. 

The venue also provided the perfect post-wedding entertainment for the couple - who confessed that the cost of hiring their own carousel and Ferris Wheel could have been well beyond their budget. 

'A Ferris wheel and a carousel was way too much for us to purchase,' Dereck joked.
