Tragic: Dartmouth student Crispin Scott, 20, was found dead in a Barcelona apartment on January 7 while studying abroad in Barcelona

A 41-year-old Spanish landlord was arrested Wednesday in conjunction with the death of Dartmouth student Crispin Scott, a 20-year-old math major who was studying abroad.

Though early autopsy results suggested that the Seattle native died from an accidental drug overdose, new evidence shows a massive amount of a powerful barbiturate in his system.

The landlord oversaw the same apartment complex in Barcelona where Scott’s body was discovered in January.

According to Spanish newspaper El Periodico, police searched the apartment where Scott was found, as well as another apartment in Barcelona during the arrest.

The officers found shocking photographs of young people – in the two dozen pictures recovered, many of them were naked or scantily clad.

According to reports, police believe the suspect in custody drugged the subjects with tranquilisers and sleeping pills.

El Periodico notes that in 2009, the landlord in question had a complaint filed against him by a young man who accused him of violating him after feeding him sleeping pills against his will.

Sources told the paper that police are investigating the possibility that this man is a ‘serial rapist.’

Scott’s parents, Pat and Norm, told student paper The Dartmouth that they have faith in the Spanish court system to ‘handle this case carefully.’

He was participating in the Academy of Liberal and Beaux-Arts program through Portland State University.

At Dartmouth, the 20-year-old math major also played on the rugby team, the student paper reported in January.

University: Crispin Scott was part of Dartmouth's Class of 2013, was majoring in mathematics, and played rugby for the school

According to The Dartmouth, the program had not officially started by the time of Scott’s death, a point to which the program’s coordinator Charles Inman is aggravated. 

‘It seems like (the police) don’t feel a need to let us into the loop just because he hadn’t started our program yet,’ Mr Inman told the paper.

'As devastated as we are by the loss of 
our beloved Crispin, the circumstances surrounding his senseless death 
add to the immense pain for us and others who cared so much for him.'

Reports say that Scott was out with several friends on the night of his death before the official start of his study-abroad program.

He failed to return to his apartment the night of January 6, and remained missing at noon on January 7 for the program’s orientation luncheon, Mr Inman told CNN.

Mr Inman told The Dartmouth that the remaining 60 Dartmouth students studying in the city under the ALBA program have not been formally notified of the arrest.

‘We don’t want to do things by email – that seems shallow,’ he said, noting that many students have likely seen the story on the Internet.

Scott’s parents said in a statement: ‘As devastated as we are by the loss of our beloved Crispin, the circumstances surrounding his senseless death add to the immense pain for us and others who cared so much for him.’

The Ecuadorian man was arrested in the Esplugues de Llobregat suburb of Barcelona, a police statement released Saturday said.
