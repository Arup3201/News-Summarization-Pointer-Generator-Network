Samu Manoa scored one try and created another as champions Northampton beat Harlequins 30-25 in front of an 82,000 crowd at Twickenham.

His back-row colleague Calum Clark admitted that the USA No 8 will be missed when he moves to Toulon in the summer. 

‘He is a great character to have around,’ he said. ‘The improvement he has made is huge.’

Richard Cockerill was stunned to see his Leicester side slump to a 15-point deficit at Sale, but delighted by the character which saw them fight back to win 32-30. 

‘Our ability to get ourselves into a deep hole was remarkable,’ said the Tigers’ director of rugby. ‘Credit to the players, they played themselves out of the hole and got into a position to win the game.’

Dean Richards is satisfied his Newcastle rebuilding project is ahead of schedule, after a 25-23 defeat at home to Saracens. 

‘We’re on the way to being able to compete with the top sides,’ said the ex-England No 8. ‘We may be two years ahead of plan.’ 

Sarries director of rugby Mark McCall added: ‘Newcastle must be the most improved side in the Premiership.’

Bath went through their attacking repertoire in claiming a 31-14 bonus-point win over Exeter at The Rec, leaving head coach Mike Ford profoundly satisfied. 

‘The good thing about our side is that we have threats all over the park,’ he said. ‘The plan was to throw the ball around a little bit. We were a bit impatient at times, but the positivity and belief the team showed was fantastic.’
