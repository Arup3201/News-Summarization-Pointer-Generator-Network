A grandmother has today spoken of her shock at finding a dead lizard wrapped in a cucumber she bought at Aldi.

Jenny Wilkinson, 54, was about to chop up the vegetable and give it to her one-year-old grandson, Theo, when she spotted an unusual mark near the top.

Upon further inspection, she realised the strange brown patch was a lizard that had been squashed in to the cucumber when it was vacuum-packed.

Mrs Wilkinson, who was about to give the vegetable to her grandson Theo, one, says the creature must have got into the batch when the cucumbers were packaged in Holland

Mrs Wilkinson believes the small reptile must have got into the batch when the cucumbers were packaged in their country of origin - Holland.

Horrified, the grandmother - who bought the 39p cucumber from a branch of Aldi in Cowes, Isle of Wight - wrote an email to the supermarket with photographs of the creature.

She has since been given £20 worth of vouchers as an apology.

Mrs Wilkinson, a chocolate shop owner, said: 'I was looking after my grandson, Theo, for the day and I went to Aldi to get some shopping.

'Theo is teething and loves cucumber, so I bought him some to eat when we got back home.

'I didn’t notice anything unusual in the shop or at the till at all.

'When
 I got home I was about to take off the wrapper and chop it up when I 
noticed something near one end, and when I looked closer, I realised it 
was a lizard.

'It looked as though it had been splatted against the cucumber while it was being wrapped up.

'It’s a good job I noticed it because otherwise I could have fed it to Theo without realising.

'It’s worrying because it makes you wonder what else could be out there, it obviously wasn’t thoroughly checked before going on the shelf. There should be more quality control.'

The company has since given the chocolate shop owner £20 in vouchers as an apology

Giles Hurley, an Aldi spokesman, said: 'We have stringent product specifications and exacting quality control measures in place to ensure the quality of all our fresh products.

'We have investigated this with our supplier and can confirm it is an isolated matter.

'We have apologised to Mrs Wilkinson and provided her with a gesture of goodwill for any inconvenience caused.'
