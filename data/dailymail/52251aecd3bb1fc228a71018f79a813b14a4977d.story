Camper and photographer Oleg Grigoriev, aged 35, has captured a series of breath-taking mountain views from the inside of his tent, with only his feet sticking out of the flap.

A veteran traveller, the Russian outdoorsman travels with little more than a tent and a camera, snapping photos of the mountainous terrain of Eastern Europe and central Asia. 

Though Grigoriev is a lawyer by trade, who lives in Ukraine, he's been camping in remote mountain regions since 2007.  

With only his feet poking out of the tent's flap, Grigoriev has photographed the world's most remote mountains on his travels around the globe

A lawyer by trade, he began travelling to the mountainous regions of central Asia and Eastern Europe in 2007 and camping in remote spots

One of his most famous photos is at Big Allo Lake, a difficult point to reach in Tajikistan's  Fann Mountains, shows the spectacular peaks reflected in the water

However, it was only after a memorable trip to the Fann Mountains of Tajikistan did he come up with the idea of photographing views from inside his tent. 

Whether danging his bare feet above the waters of Big Allo Lake, 3150m above sea level, or snapping nearly impossible-to-get shots of the highest point of the Fann Mountains, Grigoriev photographs views rarely seen by even the most adventurous of campers.

In fact, he was the first Russian person to reach the snow covered landscape of the Fann Mountains' 5489m Chimtarga peak. 

Usually travelling in a group of 10 to 15 people, Oleg has pitched his tent in the mountains of the Caucasus in Russia, the Karpaty in Ukraine and the Kazbek in Georgia. 

Grigoriev has also travelled to Georgia, Ukraine, and Russia on the search for these awe-inspiring snaps and perfect morning views

At Lake Alaudin, also in the Fann Mountains, the adventurous explorer admired this stunning vista

'I like to travel to remote places where there is no hotel or hostel, so I take a tent with me to the mountains to sleep in,' he said.

'I love the great outdoors and travelling, especially to the mountains.'

'It's a very emotive experience for me which I try to express in my photos,' he explained.

Grigoriev also hopes his gorgeous photos inspire others to get out there and travel.

'I like to think they motivate people to not be a conformist when it comes to picking holiday destinations.'
