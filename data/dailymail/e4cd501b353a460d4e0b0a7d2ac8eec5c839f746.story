A suspected thief is being hunted by police after abandoning his phone - complete with selfie screensaver - at the scene of a jewellery shop raid.

Germain Ibrahim Fofana, 27, allegedly stole three rings worth Â£18,000 from a shop in Kingston, Southwest London, after posing as a loving couple with a female accomplice, police believe.

But his scheme fell apart when officers identified him using the background picture from the phone.

Damning: This phone, containing a picture of Germain Ibrahim Fofana, 27, was left at the scene of the crime

Fofana, who is also wanted for burglary, robbery and shop-lifting, came into the shop just before 2pm on Sunday with the woman and a child in a buggy.

They posed as customers who wanted to buy engagement rings, and picked out two they were interested in. They then left the store, saying they wanted to look elsewhere.

Fofana later returned by himself, and asked the same shop assistant whether he could see the rings again - as well as a wedding ring.

After tricking the assistant into handing all three rings over, Fofana ran out of the shop - but left his phone behind, containing the damning photograph.

Detective Sergeant Damion Cummings from Kingston CID, said: 'In his hurry to run out of the shop, the suspect left his mobile phone on the table alongside his bag.

'While police were on scene the phone lit up having received a text message and a picture of the suspect was saved as the background. It was then the shop assistant who served him was able to identify the person in the picture.

'Having conducted further enquiries the suspect has been identified as Germain Ibrahim Fofana, a 27-year-old French national.

'We also know he is wanted for further offences including shop-lifting, robbery and burglary across some other London boroughs.'

Police are appealing for information about Fofana and his accomplice. They described him as being around 5ft 7ins, and said he speaks with a French accent. He was last seen wearing a light blue shirt, grey suit trousers and boating shoes.

Officers said the woman is of large build, has long black hair and was dressed all in black.

Anyone with information on the case can contact DS Cummings at Kingston police on 020 8721 5880.
