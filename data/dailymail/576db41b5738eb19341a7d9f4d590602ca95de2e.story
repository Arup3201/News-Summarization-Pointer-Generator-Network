A man walking down a Toronto street early Wednesday morning was stabbed in the heart after police say he accidentally bumped into two strangers while sending text messages on his phone.

The victim, 33-year-old Aria Kahafizadeh, was rushed to a hospital with life-threatening injuries that required emergency surgery.

Detectives have apprehended one of the suspects in the stabbing, identified as 27-year-old Mohamed Ali. The other man who had the knife remains at large.

Toronto investigators say the incident took place at around 12.30am Wednesday when Aria Kahafizadeh was walking along Yonge Street with his smartphone in his hands.

According to detectives, the 33-year-old man was busy sending texts when he accidentally bumped shoulders with Mohamad Ali and his unidentified companion.

Detective Jason Shanakaran told CTV that for some reason the two pedestrians took umbrage and attacked Kahafizadeh.

But the 33-year-old victim turned out to be in 'good shape' and fought back against his two assailants. 

Shankaran said it was at a moment when Kahafizedeh let down his guard thinking that the fight was over that one of the suspects pulled a knife on him and stabbed him in the chest multiple times.

One of the blows pierced the man's heart, according to police, leaving Kahafizadeh in critical condition.

Hours after the bloody confrontation, Mohamad Ali returned to the scene of the crime to retrieve some of his discarded belongings and was apprehended by police.

The 27-year-old has been charged with attempted murder and aggravated assault.

Toronto police are still searching for the second suspect, who is described as 5-foot-8, with close-cropped black hair and a chin strapped beard. He was last seen wearing a black and white sweater.
