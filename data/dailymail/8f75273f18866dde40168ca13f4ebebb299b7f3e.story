Tests: David Nutt wants to try out Class A drugs on sick patients

A sacked Government drugs tsar has been awarded more than £500,000 of public money to carry out a controversial world-first trial using ‘magic mushrooms’ to treat depression.

Professor David Nutt wants to investigate the way sick patients are affected by a hallucinogenic substance contained in the mushrooms.

As president of the British Neuroscience Association, he has been given the cash by the Medical Research Council.

The exercise is also backed by shadowy charity the Beckley Foundation, which is run by an aristocrat dubbed ‘Lady Mindbender’ and lobbies to liberalise laws on mind-altering drugs.

But Professor Nutt’s chances of carrying out his research are being hampered by ‘archaic’ European, United Nations and Home Office laws which govern clinical trials and make such drugs illegal. He says it is impossible to gain access to the hallucinogen to carry out the trial and is fighting for a change in the law.

Magic mushrooms are, along  with heroin and cocaine, defined as potent Class A drugs. They are known to have a powerful effect, and are thought to have the potential to make some mental disorders worse.

Possession can lead to seven years in jail and an unlimited fine, and some users have complained of suffering flashbacks and paranoia. Several deaths have been linked to magic mushrooms in recent years.

Previous research carried out by Professor Nutt on healthy volunteers – which is subject to far less rigorous regulation – found that psilocybin, the active ingredient in the mushrooms, reduced the level of activity in the part of the brain which appears to cause some  people to be locked into a continual cycle of depression.

He now wants to explore whether prescribing magic mushrooms to those with severe depression can, along with regular psychotherapy, improve a patient’s well-being.

Speaking ahead of the British Neuroscience Association’s festival of neuroscience this week, Professor Nutt said: ‘Finding a company to provide this illegal drug has, as yet, proved impossible.

‘So we’re between a rock and a hard place, which is unfortunate. Because if this is an effective treatment – which it may well be for some people – then they’re obviously being denied that possibility.

Dangerous: Magic mushrooms are thought to have the potential to make mental disorders worse

‘One of the things we have to do is have a more rational debate about the way the drug laws are implemented. If they’re actually denying access to powerful tools which could potentially improve human well-being, then they’re not doing what they should be doing.’

Professor Nutt added: ‘I’ve spoken to people in Government and we’re continuing to try to get the Home Office to understand that the current way the regulations are implemented is hindering research.

‘We have an archaic set of laws which were established by the United Nations in the Sixties and they’re inappropriate for modern medicine and modern science.’

The academic, who was sacked from his role as the Government’s chief drugs adviser in 2009 after claiming LSD and ecstasy were less harmful than alcohol, plans to dress up in Victorian costume at the conference to give a talk on whether psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud ‘was wrong to give up on drugs’.

Freud argued cocaine could cure heroin addiction – but then became addicted to cocaine himself.

For the trial, Professor Nutt wants to recruit 60 patients with depression who have failed to respond to two previous treatments. Half will be given a synthetic form of psilocybin and half a placebo drug.

Under current laws, academic researchers are not allowed to manufacture Class A drugs. Companies that could supply the drugs must have a Home Office licence but Professor Nutt said this could take a year and potentially triple the cost of the exercise.

Only four hospitals in the UK have a licence to hold psilocybin – and Professor Nutt said the Home Office refused to tell him which they were.

Supporter: Lady Neipath said she has been working with Professor Nutt since 1998

The magic mushrooms trial  was initiated by a charity that lobbies to liberalise the drugs laws and examines links between illegal dugs and creativity.

The Beckley Foundation is run by aristocrat Lady Neidpath, who has taken drugs in the past and has said that she considers herself ‘my own best laboratory’.

The 69-year-old has worked closely with Professor Nutt’s team, planning the research after providing £50,000 for the work.

Lady Neidpath also recently helped secure separate ethical approval for a study investigating the effects of LSD on the brain. This will be carried out by Professor Nutt and his fellow researchers at Imperial College London.

The Government’s current drugs tsar, Professor Les Iversen, was criticised for having links to the Beckley Foundation. His profile appears on the foundation’s website along with those of other members of its advisory panel.

However, Lady Neidpath said Professor Iversen had not carried out any work with the foundation since his appointment as chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs in 2010 and was not advising the charity.

She has been campaigning for 20 years to investigate the therapeutic potential of illegal drugs and has been involved in a collaboration with Johns Hopkins University in the US to use psilocybin to treat nicotine addiction.

Yesterday she said: ‘We have  an ongoing association with  the research team at Imperial College and I’ve been working with Professor Nutt since  about 1998. How else can you lessen the harm for people with post-traumatic stress, depression and addiction, and discover the benefits of drugs like LSD and psilocybin? But good things are beginning to happen.’
