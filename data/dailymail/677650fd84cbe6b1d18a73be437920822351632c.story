Residents on an unfortunately shaped street fear house prices could drop after Google Earth images revealed their estate resembles male genitalia.

Locals on George Road, Edward Road and Yeoman Cottages in Hoylake on the Wirral, Merseyside, fear potential house-hunters will now not want to buy a property in the area.

When viewed from above the red roofs on the homes - which have an average price of £200,000  - turn the unassuming cul-de-sac into an unmistakable phallic shape.

Resident Carl Hodge said the street had ‘become a laughing stock’ since the image was spotted by someone on Google Earth - and urged bosses at the US-based company to take down the photo.

The 45-year-old added: ‘I haven't heard of anyone moving out because of it but we are definitely worried it would put of potential buyers if we ever wanted to sell.

‘Who would want to live in the cul-de-sac that everyone is taking the mick out of? They say Google Earth is fascinating and people spend hours on it but it has been a nightmare for us.

‘I think Google should remove the street from the internet. It might be funny but it's no laughing matter if you're trying to sell your house.’

Ground level: The houses were built in the 1950s and 60s but their shape was only revealed when locals checked the latest Google satellite images

Elsewhere: The row over the street comes days after FIFA bosses were left blushing when it emerged the quirky design for Qatar's first 2022 World Cup stadium could be seen as an erotic shape

Another Hoylake resident who lives nearby added: ‘It is so funny. I live close but thankfully I'm not on the road itself. I'd definitely move out if I lived there and everyone was laughing at me.’

George Road is made up of a mixture of privately-owned semi-detached houses and ex-council owned terraced properties.

The houses were built in the 1950s and 60s but their shape was only revealed when locals checked the latest Google satellite images.

The row over the street comes days after FIFA bosses were left blushing when it emerged the quirky design for Qatar's first 2022 World Cup stadium could be seen as an erotic shape.

The proposed 40,000-seater Al-Wakrah stadium is meant to resemble the sails of a dhow boat, which is traditionally used for pearl fishing. But many people took to Twitter to point out that it also looked anatomically female.
