Travellers have been accused of creating a 'Grand Canyon' of rubbish  after dumping two tonnes of waste on playing fields in revenge for being moved on.

The group allegedly went door-to-door collecting doors, toilets, furniture, and rubble before leaving mountains of mess on Ashburton Playing Fields in Croydon.

Croydon Council had them evicted last week after they set up an illegal camp there - so in response to the court order the travellers appear to have dumped the commercial and domestic waste.

Taxpayers will be left with a bill of at least £15,000 to clear up the mess.

Disgusting: Travellers have been blamed for dumping two tonnes of waste on playing fields after they were evicted from some public playing fields

Allegations: The group went door to door to collect whatever items they could get from homes and businesses after Croydon Council had them removed

Mess: The local council say the clear-up will cost at least £15,000 and every penny will have to be covered by the taxpayer

Andrew Chesham, 32, who uses the playing field to walk his dog told the Standard: 'I cannot believe the mess is still there. I’ve never seen anything dumped on this scale before.

'There’s everything from broken toilets to piles of office furniture all dumped in big mounds. It’s like the Grand Canyon of rubbish and mess that you can walk through'. 

Andy Bloss, 25, who also walks his dogs there told the Croydon Advertiser: 'I am angry as after all this is where I live and it is being vandalized . This is not the first time this happened.

'It happens a few times every year, not just in the park but also in the woods opposite.

'They stay, dump their rubbish, then go. They have no regard for residents and the many families who live in the area'.

Tough job: A worker uses a rake to try to clear the mess as a JCB digger is used to lift the larger items dumped

Vast: People who use the playing fields have said that they have never seen anything like the mess left  

Detritus: Doors, toilets, furniture, commecial waste and rubble has been dumped on Ashburton Playing Fields

Hard work: Croydon council promises to remove fly-tipped waste in 48 hours but this could take longer

How it should look: Ashburton Playing Fields is a much loved community resource that was taken over by travellers several weeks ago

The local council launched its 'Don't Mess with Croydon' campaign in May and promised all fly tipping would be removed within 48 hours - but the travellers' waste has been there since last week.

A spokesman said: 'The cost of clearing the fly-tip from Ashburton Park is £15,000, a cost that is borne by Croydon's council taxpayers. The council is determined to stamp out this criminal activity and will prosecute any fly-tippers that dump their rubbish on borough roads.

'We are aware of the fly-tipping in Ashburton Park and are in the process of removing it.

'We will also be seeking to prosecute those responsible.'
