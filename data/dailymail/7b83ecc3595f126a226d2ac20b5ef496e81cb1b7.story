The new lead in the Broadway production of The Phantom Of The Opera has caused outrage after it emerged he has previously been convicted of child sex offenses.  

The show announced this week that 48-year-old James Barbour would take over the role of Phantom starting in February in New York.

The announcement drew criticism that it was inappropriate for the long-running musical to hire someone whose past includes sex offenses involving a teenage girl 14 years ago.

The Phantom Of The Opera has been running for 25 years on Broadway but has come under fire for its recent choice of leading man

The actor was indicted in 2006 on nine counts of engaging in criminal sexual acts, sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child.  

Barbour pleaded guilty in 2008 to two misdemeanors involving a 15-year-old in 2001. 

He was sentenced to 60 days in jail and three years' probation. 

After serving out his sentence, the musical star returned to Broadway in September 2008 to star in A Tale Of Two Cities. 

He was nominated for the Drama Desk, Drama League and Outer Critics Awards for Best Actor for that show.

Barbour is married to actress Dana Stackpole, 48, who also previously starred in the musical.  

Following the announcement that he was joining the cast, fans of Phantom expressed their outrage.

One, Kayla Fender, posted on the show's Facebook page: 'It is highly inappropriate to cast a convicted child molester as the Phantom, especially with such a young fan base and such young Christines playing opposite him. I will not be supporting this show with him playing the Phantom.' 

Producers issued a statement on the show's Facebook page Wednesday, saying Barbour had accepted responsibility for his actions and he 'honored the second chance he was given'.

The statement continued: 'Following his sentence in 2008, James resumed his career, starring in A TALE OF TWO CITIES on Broadway. 

'In the seven years since then, he has appeared in countless productions in New York and around the country, receiving great acclaim, and maintaining a spotless reputation.

 Additionally, he has been an active member of the Broadway community, giving his time to numerous charitable causes.' 

According to The Phantom Of The Opera fan site, the show, created by Andrew Lloyd Webber, is the longest-running in Broadway history with more than 10,000 performances over 25 years.
