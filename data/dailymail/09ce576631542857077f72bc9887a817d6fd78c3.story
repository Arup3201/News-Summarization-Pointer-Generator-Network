The death penalty is being sought for a couple who allegedly tortured their three-year-old son in a house of horrors where dents in the wall are though to show where they hung him upside down to whip him.

Jillian Tait, 31, and Gary Lee Fellenbaum, 23, are charged with murdering Tait's son, Scott McMillan.

The Chester County District Attorney's Office told the pair at their arraignments this week that prosecutors will seek the death penalty against them because the boy died by torture and was younger than 12.

'American horror story': Scott McMillan, three, was tortured for weeks and beaten with a frying pan until he eventually died, prosecutors in Pennsylvania have said

Arrested: Amber Fellenbaum, 21, has been charged with child endangerment for allegedly witnessing the beatings of three-year-old Scott McMillan but doing nothing to stop them 

Officials said the Pennsylvania couple went car shopping, bought pizza and took a nap as Scott lay dying after weeks of escalating abuse that ended in three days of systematic torture.

They are accused of laughing as Scott was hung upside down and whipped, striking him repeatedly with a frying pan, and eventually beating him to death.

Chester County District Attorney Thomas Hogan called the case 'an American horror story.'

'It was an unspeakable act of depravity,' he said.

Noting that investigators found no evidence that drugs or alcohol had been involved, he said: 'This is just evilness.'

The couple met working at Wal-Mart and last month moved in together, along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children — Tait's 6- and 3-year-old sons and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter. 

The six lived in a mobile home park outside the city of Coatesville, about 35 miles northwest of Philadelphia.

The prosecutor said what started as spankings morphed into 'concentrated, repeated, escalating abuse.' 

Then, 'over three days he was systematically tortured and beaten to death,' Hogan said. 

Torture tool: The Chester County District Attorney came across a horrifying scene when they entered the pair's trailer home in Pennsylvania. This is one of the whips that was believed to have been used to strike Scott 

Sickening: Investigators found holes in the wall where Fellenbaum had allegedly smashed Scott's head 

Death bed: The mattress where Scott was put on after Fellenbaum allegedly beat him until he was unresponsive is covered in blankets and clothes. The pair had sex and ate pizza as Scott lay there dying 

The three adults told authorities 'that Scott McMillan had been punched and beaten with blunt and sharp objects, whipped, taped to a chair with electrical tape and beaten, hung up by his feet and beaten, and suffered other acts of violence,' police said in affidavits.

'During one incident,' the affidavits say, 'Gary hung Scott and (his older brother) up by their feet one at a time and beat the boys while they were hanging upside down. Jillian stated that she and Gary were laughing during the incident.'

Hogan said the older brother apparently knew that if he struggled while being hung from the back of a door, it would only get worse. But his younger brother squirmed and struggled, he said.

'They thought that was funny,' he said.

Fellenbaum's 21-year-old estranged wife, Amber Fellenbaum, was charged with child endangerment for allegedly failing to help the toddler. 

She ultimately called 911 Tuesday night, authorities said.

By then, Scott had been unresponsive for hours and had been put in a shower for more than 30 minutes by his mother and her boyfriend, investigators said. 

Weapon: A bent curtain rod was also found, which attorneys believe was another item used to hit the boy

Sickening: Another whip, put together using electrical tape which was also used to tie Scott to chairs, was found on the floor in another part of their home 

When the boy failed to awaken, they placed him on an uninflated air mattress and went shopping, authorities said.

Gary Fellenbaum severely beat the boy for refusing to eat toast both Monday and Tuesday morning, authorities said. The 'discipline' included throwing him against a wall, knocking him off a chair with a punch and then taping him to the chair to keep him upright for more beatings, police said.

Tait said Fellenbaum had thrown the boy against the wall so hard, it 'caused a hole in the wall,' according to the statement she gave police.

She told police that she took part in the abuse and saw the scars on her younger son, court documents said.

Pain: Prosecutors said Scott had gone through weeks of torment, but the torture intensified when the youngster refused to eat his breakfast

Scene: The pair were living in a trailer with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children — Tait's 6- and 3-year-old sons and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter
