There was the same languid stride, opening up to cover the pitch; the same fiery will to win when he slid, sometimes rashly, into tackles and a muscular core that defied opponents to win the ball off him.

Paul Pogba, the £60million midfielder, was the man of the match as France beat Nigeria 2-0 on Monday and for Arsene Wenger, watching in the stands for French TV, and France manager Didier Deschamps there must have been some wistful memories.

For Wenger they would have been fond recollections of a towering presence in his Arsenal sides and, for Deschamps, of a formidable former midfield partner.

Yohan Cabaye, the tactical brains of 
this France team, sensed it too. ‘Fortunately for us he is like Patrick 
Vieira,’ said the former Newcastle United midfielder.

‘He
 is very important for the team dynamic, and we just enjoy playing 
together with him. That unity is the best way for us to progress as far 
as we can.’

And the Manchester City coach, former Arsenal captain and icon of the greatest France team, indulges the comparison.

‘People
 say he’s like me — I guess we have similar power in possession and he’s
 strong, quite tall, an elegant player,’ said Vieira.

‘But
 in his head he’s more attacking than I ever was. I would win more balls
 but he’s more technical. He’ll become one of the best in the world.’

Cabaye
 may be playing with him a little more regularly next season. Even 
though Pogba looks like a player made for the physicality of the Premier
 League, just as Vieira was, Paris Saint-Germain are embarking on a 
project to bring home the exiles of French football, especially the 
Parisians.

And for the man 
born in Lagny-sur-Marne, a suburb to the east of the city, Paris seems 
to be his destination of choice after Manchester United let him slip 
through the net two years ago when they objected to the demands of Mino 
Raiola, his agent.

David
 Moyes would have done all he could to bring Pogba back to Old Trafford 
this summer had the manager stayed in place but English sides accept 
that if Juventus let him leave, it looks impossible to stop a Paris 
return.

Pogba retains 
excellent English from his two years in the North West. ‘Why should we 
be afraid of anyone?’ he said in reply to a question from a German 
journalist in defiant English. ‘We’re the France national team!’

HEAD MASTERAt 6ft 1in Pogba is three inches shorter than Vieira but still stands out in central midfield. Unlike many tall players, who don’t need to try to win headers, he has good spring and a well-timed leap, as demonstrated for the opening goal against Nigeria.DICTATORVieira rates him a much better technical player than he was, though the former Arsenal man had a decent pass on him too. Nevertheless, an in-form Pogba has that rare ability to dictate a game with the quality of his distribution.TOUGH IN THE TACKLEHe is formidable — just ask Nigeria’s Ogenyi Onazi, who was targeted early in Monday’s match. As that challenge showed though, Pogba can be indiscriminate and so he risks being sent off if he can’t rein in his natural aggression.BOX-TO-BOX MANPogba isn’t slow, but he is more of a 400m runner than an out-and-out sprinter. Once his long legs open up their stride, he can chase down most players. As such, he is the ideal ‘box-to-box’ English midfielder.TOWER OF POWERThe comparison with Vieira bears up best when you consider his body strength. His physicality is his prime attribute and it’s near enough impossible to get the ball off him if he is focused on his task.BIG ENGINEHe’s young so it will take time to develop. Decision-making in the final ball could improve. ‘He likes running for the ball,’ said one scout.'Not sure how much he likes running to get it back.’

That
 determined attitude led to his falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson at 
United. At the time, in 2012,  Ferguson and the then chief executive 
David Gill would not buckle when faced with the wage demands of Pogba 
and Raiola.

The fact that 
the player was friendly with Mario Balotelli and enjoyed hanging out 
with the Manchester City striker at the San Carlo restaurant in the city
 is also unlikely to have endeared him to Ferguson.

Part of Pogba’s argument was he expected first-team football; he made just seven appearances for the club, but was only 18.

United
 refused to back down, and Pogba left for Juventus. With hindsight, it 
looks like the equivalent of winning a  battle but losing the war: the 
Frenchman certainly looks a perfect fit for United’s midfield now.

That
 said, at 21 he remains raw and his decision-making with the final pass 
at times against Nigeria was awry. ‘He is still young and he has a lot 
of things to learn,’ said Hugo Lloris, the Tottenham goalkeeper and 
France captain.

‘But that 
kind of game can help him to get more confidence because to score and be
 decisive in the last 16 of a World Cup is a big thing.’

Deschamps was under pressure to drop Pogba for Moussa Sissoko, as his displays had not been what France hoped for and expected.

‘He
 kept his confidence even though he has been getting a lot of 
criticism,’ said Cabaye. ‘He stays relaxed. He knows the team is with 
him. Against Nigeria he showed what he can do and it is the best way to 
give a response to those who criticise.’

He
 certainly demonstrated his physical prowess — at times too well. His 
early tackle on Ogenyi Onazi infuriated Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi. 
Deschamps had stressed to Blaise Matuidi and Pogba that they would have 
to match the strength of the Nigerians in midfield.

They seemed to take the message a step too far, with Onazi taken off with a serious ankle injury after one Matuidi challenge.

And
 though Pogba rose well to score his header and hit an excellent 
first-half volley, France’s win had as much to do with Mathieu 
Valbuena’s steady work and the introduction of Antoine Griezmann.

Nevertheless,
 there is a feeling among the French that the goal and accolades that 
followed will allow Pogba to fulfil the role prepared for him. ‘It was 
one of the biggest evenings of my career but the victory is more 
important than the goal,’ said Pogba. ‘It’s liberating for the team. I 
play for the team, for France.’

‘History
 is repeating itself’ was the front-page headline of France’s sports 
daily L’Equipe yesterday and they dared to reference those great teams 
of 1998 and 2006.

After
 all they have Deschamps, who lifted the World Cup in 98, and perhaps 
they have Vieira’s replacement. So, as Pogba says, why should they fear 
the Germans?
