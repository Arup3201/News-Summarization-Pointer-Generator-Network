A town has been left overflowing with rubbish bags after binmen have refused to pick them up - because the sacks are the wrong colour.

Mountains of household waste is lining streets in Weymouth, Dorset, after residents were given blue bin bags as part of a new waste collection scheme rolled out in the town. 

But some claim they did not receive the new blue sacks, and have continued to use the standard black ones - only for them to be left by the side of the road by binmen under strict orders not to take away the 'unauthorised bags'.

Piles of rubbish bags have been mounting up in streets around the town for the past two weeks, to the anger of residents.

Mountains of household waste is lining streets in Weymouth, Dorset, after binmen have refused to pick them up - because the sacks are the wrong colour

Rubbish has been left on the streets in Weymouth for as long as two weeks because it is in 'unauthorised' regular black bin bags instead of the authorised blue sacks

The council-run Dorset Waste Partnership said it is 'applying its policy' to limit residents to one household rubbish bag a week in the hope they will recycle more.

They said they sent leaflets to every household before the new system was put in place, and have been delivering blue sacks to properties that didn't get them.

Residents have branded the decision to leave the black bin bags 'childish' and have called on the council to sort out the problem before Christmas.

Town centre resident Andy Price said: 'There are families with young children down here and I think it is disgusting that they are leaving the rubbish on the roads. It's a health risk.

'It is going to encourage rodents, and seagulls have already been ripping the bags open.'

John Gough, owner of popular Weymouth pub the Cutter Hotel, said: 'I know they are saying they have informed everyone about the blue bags and I am sure they have - but if they didn't give you the bags, what can you do? I have told them I do not have the blue bags.'

Local councillor Francis Drake said: 'It's tit for tat. The DWP should pick up all the rubbish rather than leaving it - then send someone round to educate residents.

'This needs to be sorted out otherwise this town is going to have a big health problem.'

Residents voiced their concerns on social media.

Arlbergbahn said: 'Oh this is getting pathetic. Just how idiotically stubborn are these pompous bureaucrats? 'We are now applying the policy', 'we are sending education teams', like they're politicians. Don't be so pathetically childish and stubborn.'

Gerbilface said: 'Lazy bin men are the problem, just pick the black bags up for now God's sake! Then post a handful of blue bags through every door or leave them at the Cutter pub for locals to pick them up if they can'tbe bothered to post them. Is it really that hard to sort this issue out?'

CharlesCharlieCharleyson said: 'DWP: Do the job you are paid to do and pick up the rubbish! I don't give a damn what colour the bags are you children.'

Steve Burdis, director of the Dorset Waste Partnership, said: 'We sent leaflets to every household about the new service in April and May to give them time to contact us. We also held roadshows and provided information through the local media and online.

'Properties unable to use wheelie bins receive an annual supply of authorised blue sacks for rubbish. Our policy states that we will not collect rubbish left outside a bin in unauthorised sacks.

'During the first two months we collected extra sacks while the service was bedding in but we are now applying the policy.

'We have been delivering outstanding blue sacks to properties that have contacted us. Our education team is working alongside collection crews, going door-to-door advising residents.' 

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles declared two years ago that having bins emptied once a week was a ‘fundamental right’ – but cutbacks to the service have accelerated under his watch, with 60 councils introducing a fortnightly waste collection since May 2010. 

Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives. They were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory.
