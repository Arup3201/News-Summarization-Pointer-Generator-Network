Killed: Zbigniew Lyson, 43, died at his home in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, on Saturday from severe burns

Firefighters have admitted they might have reacted faster to help a man who died after apparently dousing himself in petrol before setting fire to his home had they not been on strike.

Zbigniew Lyson, 43, died from severe burns after he was pulled from the burning building by 
firefighters and taken to Whitechapel 
Hospital, London.

His house, in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, was engulfed in flames at 2pm 
on Saturday just hours into the latest round of strike action taken by 
firefighters over pensions.

Several neighbours claimed Mr Lyson started the fire by dousing himself and his family in petrol.

Today the fire service admitted it 
could have reacted faster if the crew closest to the scene of the blaze 
400 yards away at Welwyn Station hadn't been on strike.

It took another working crew 10 minutes to reach the property.

A spokesman for the Hertfordshire Fire
 and Rescue Service said: 'Had
 the strike not been on, the response most likely would have been faster
 but the attendance time of 10 minutes is within our targets to respond 
from the first call.'

'However,
 it is unclear at the moment if the outcome would have been different as
 the crew may have been at another incident, or the other side of 
Hatfield.'

He added that
 the Welwyn station, which has one full-time fire engine and a retained 
engine, was not 'operational' at the time of the blaze.

Mr Lyson is thought to have worked at Ocado and moved to the UK from his home in Andrychów, Poland.

It
 is believed he poured petrol on himself, locked the doors and windows 
and then set the three-bedroom end terraced house alight. Locals said his wife and three children managed to escape but he remained inside.

Hertfordshire
 Fire and Rescue Service said that the first fire engine reached the 
blazing house within its ten-minute target time. They said it was sent from an undisclosed location around two miles away where it was based because of the strike.

A spokesman said the initial call was received at 1.59pm and the first engine arrived on scene at 2.09pm.

Strike:
 Firefighters have admitted that they could have got to the scene of this blaze in Welwyn Garden City faster if they hadn't been on strike. Zbigniew Lyson died on 
Saturday from severe burns

Scene: Investigators were today at the site of the fire trying to determine what caused it. Petrol is believed to be involved according to the neighbours

Neighbours said police asked them whether they saw the father-of-three take petrol into the house.

Pensioner John Ephgrave, 75, said: 'I heard that he doused himself in petrol and his wife and children. He went upstairs then his wife and children managed to escape.

'There was two loud explosions and it went on for a long time because our fire brigade was on strike.'

Mother-of-two
 Brenda O'Neill, 47, said: 'It was awful. I came back home while it was 
still going on. 'They put the fire out but then it reignited.

'Apparently
 he locked all the doors and window. The wife was covered in petrol when
 she came out. The police asked me if I saw him bringing petrol in the 
house but I didn't see it.

'There was definitely an accelerant in there. We smelt smoke and the next thing you know it was up in flames.

'I would never have imagined that he would do that. They were a nice, quiet family. They always looked happy.'

Nearby: Welwyn Fire Station is just 400 yards from the charred house

Idle: Welwyn fire station was not operational when firefighters were called to Mr Lyson's house

Damage: The home was devastated by the fire, which firefighters say they still reached within a 10 minute timeframe

Today police and fire investigators were 
at the charred home in the residential street of Heronswood Road, Welwyn
 Garden City, Hertfordshire, to find out what caused the inferno.

Del Macleod, chairman of the Hertfordshire FBU branch, said striking firefighters were not at the nearby station at the time of the fire.

'Hertfordshire Fire Service does not permit staff to stay on their premises when striking,' he said.

Mr Macleod said it was a 'difficult time'
 for everyone involved and said all the thoughts of the crews were with 
the family of the man who died.

He added that on a normal day there 
was a good chance a crew would have been available to attend to the fire
 from the nearby station, but it was 'not guaranteed.'

A
 post mortem examination is to be carried out on the dead man’s body to 
establish the exact cause of his death and an inquest will be opened and
 adjourned.

Mr Lyson died during Saturday's Fire Brigades Union (FBU) strike, the latest exchange between firefighters and the Government over plans to raise retirement ages.

Firefighters across the country walked out from 10am until 5pm over the weekend - the 14th sch strike since a campaign of industrial action started in September.

Members of the FBU are protesting plans to hike pension contributions and increase the age of retirement for firemen from 55 to 60.

Union leaders say that stringent fitness tests could mean that older firefighters could be forced to quit if they fail, which could lead to their pensions being slashed.

Only firefighters in England and Wales took part in this weekend's strike. The FBU has struck a deal with the Northern Irish government, which agreed to keep the retirement age at 55.

Services made back-up plans for the strikes, but admitted they would not be able to respond to every 999 call.
