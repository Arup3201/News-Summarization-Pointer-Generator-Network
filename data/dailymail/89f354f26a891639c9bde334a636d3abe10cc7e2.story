The time is 8.30am and I'm crouching under the hand-dryers in the ladies' loo at Waterloo Station frantically trying to dry my hair.

I've got a meeting in 15 minutes and for the third time this week I've left the house with my hair soaking wet, plastered to my face and dripping down my neck.

In my quest for long hair, there is no indignity I will not endure.

The manufacturers of a new shampoo and conditioner, Fortified Amino Scalp Therapy (Fast), make the quite extraordinary claim that if you use it every single day, it can boost the rate of hair growth by up to 99 per cent in a month.

For a working mum whose usual haircare routine is a twice-weekly wash and blow-dry at home, committing to a daily shampoo is daunting, and I'm finding it hard to fit it into my morning schedule.

But I am desperate. My short hair makes me feel dowdy and middle-aged. I yearn for swathes of long, glossy, glamorous hair.

The really awful thing is that I had gorgeous long hair until I lopped it off last April — a mistake I've regretted ever since. I ended up looking like a giant earbud.

I'd worn my hair long for almost 20 years and when I hit 45, I decided it was time for a radical change: either get a toyboy or cut my hair short. Sadly, the hair went — in a misguided belief that eight inches off my locks would cut ten years off my face.

The world's most desirable women all have luscious locks, like Angelina Jolie's 

For a while, I tried to convince myself I liked it. My female friends thought I looked sassy with short hair. But men hated it.

One pal, Jacob, didn't mince his words. 'It's the sort of cut a middle-aged woman gets when she can't be bothered any more,' he said. Brutal, but it summed up what most chaps thought.

'Men like long hair because they think it's feminine,' says Philip Kingsley, an internationally renowned trichologist with clinics in London and New York.

You only have to look at the women the world's most eligible bachelors choose to marry to see that he has a point. Kate Middleton, Angelina Jolie and Amal Alamuddin all have beautiful, long thick hair.

So, Fast shampoo and conditioner and its promise of turbo-charged hair growth seemed the answer to my dreams.

Most people's hair, grows an average of 1 cm to 1.3 cm per month, says Philip Kingsley. Nisim International, the Canadian company that makes Fast, claims it can accelerate growth by using a blend of amino acids — the building blocks of proteins — and essential vitamins.

This super-nourishing concoction works by feeding hair at its root and stimulating the scalp — a body-building blast of nutrients for hair.

In clinical trials of (an admittedly paltry) 20 volunteers, the average rate of hair growth was 30 per cent faster than normal — though some saw growth 99 per cent faster than usual.

John Nikolaou, founder of Nisim, points out that the shampoo won't create new hair growth, just encourage existing hair to grow faster.

But those in the business are sceptical. My hairdresser Sally guffawed when I told her about Fast promising to double the rate of my hair growth in a month. 'Does it lift your face at the same time?' she chortled.

Philip Kingsley is also dubious. While agreeing that particular proteins and minerals in diet play an important role in healthy hair, he thinks it's highly unlikely that a topically applied shampoo will make hair grow faster.

So I decided to put Fast shampoo and conditioner to the test. First, I measured my hair. Taking measurements from five different places: front, back, left and right sides, and crown. I then averaged out the result.

At the start of August, I had a starting length of 23.5cm.

I also measured the rate of growth following my usual twice-weekly washing regime with my normal shampoo and conditioner.

At the start of September my hair measured 24.4cm: a monthly growth of 9mm, slightly slower than average. Could Fast do better?

WEEK ONE

At £30 for a pack with 300ml of shampoo and 300ml of conditioner, Fast is more than double what I normally spend on my Charles Worthington shampoo and conditioner — £6 each for 250ml.

The shampoo is a thicker texture and harder to lather. As per the instructions, I apply it twice, each time massaging it into my scalp. After rinsing, my hair feels brittle and sticky but the conditioner certainly helps soften it. Altogether, the new routine takes an extra ten minutes each day.

I'm worried that washing my hair every day will dry it out, or worse, make it fall out.

But Dr Hugh Rushton, a Harley Street trichologist, tells me not only is it OK to wash my hair every day, it's what I should be doing. 'Do you wash your face twice a week?' he asks.

After a few days, I realise why I don't wash my hair every day. Unlike my hair, my face doesn't rearrange itself into frizzy spikes post wash — and shampooing in the mornings is a logistical nightmare. I end up drying my hair in public toilets and giving my eight-year-old daughter a Dairy Milk bar for breakfast two days in a row because of the extra time I take every morning.

But, by day six, I think I can see some growth. 'Do you think my hair looks longer?' I ask Jacob. 'No,' he says bluntly. 

WEEK TWO 

Realising I just don't have enough time to wash my hair each morning, I start doing it in the evenings instead. But at the end of the day all I want to do is slump in front of my Breaking Bad box set with a glass or two of wine.

Instead, I find myself hogging the bathroom. On the plus side, my wine consumption is down, and running straighteners through my hair, I'm convinced more ends flick up — surely a sign it's growing? And washing it every day has made it beautifully soft. It's in better condition than it has been for years.

WEEK THREE 

Getting my roots done, Sally tries to persuade me to have a couple of centimetres snipped off. 'You need a trim. It's getting quite long,' she says.

Fast, claims it can accelerate growth by using a blend of amino acids — the building blocks of proteins — and essential vitamins 

I feel like kissing her. There's no doubt — my hair is no longer short. It isn't long either. But it's getting there. I swear I'll never hack my hair off again.

I know how Samson felt. It's probably worse for me than it was for him: he just lost his strength, I lost my femininity.

WEEK FOUR 

When I measure my hair in the same places I'm delighted to find my locks now average out at 25.6 cm, an increase of 1.2 cm. That's 3 mm (or 33 per cent) more than it grew last month. It looks like using Fast has made it grow faster.

But is it really possible that the ingredients in the shampoo encouraged my hair to grow?

Trichologists are unconvinced. Philip Kingsley speculates that rather than the specific ingredients it's the massaging 14 times a week that made the slight difference, as it would have increased blood flow to the hair follicles.

Stephen Carson, a London-based trichologist, says it's more likely that conditioning my hair every day for a month is responsible for the growth.

'There are highly protective substances in conditioners that cling to your hair and prevent ends from splitting off, making it seem as though your hair has grown faster,' he explains.

Most good conditioners contain protective ingredients and it isn't necessary to use a super-expensive brand for stronger, longer hair, he says.

Whatever the reason, I'm delighted. Shampooing every day is laborious, but the joy of running a comb through hair that ends below my neck is immense. I feel feminine again.

I'll carry on using Fast (the pack lasted just over a month) because it seems to work.

A bad hair day is wretched - a bad hair year doesn't bear thinking about.
