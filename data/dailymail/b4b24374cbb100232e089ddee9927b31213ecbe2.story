Lord Justice Fulford has been cleared of any allegations of misconduct by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office

A top judge who founded a campaign group which helped leaders of the Paedophile Information Exchange in 1979 has been exonerated by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office.

An investigation was launched in March when The Mail on Sunday revealed Appeal Court Judge and Privy Counsellor Lord Justice Fulford, at the time a young barrister, set up an organisation called Conspiracy Against Public Morals.

The group campaigned against conspiracy charges faced by PIE leaders. But Lord Justice Fulford has now been cleared of any allegations of misconduct.

The judge sparked anger earlier this year by slashing the prison sentence of a primary school deputy who hoarded films of the sadistic abuse of young children.

Stephen Horn, 34, admitted viewing child pornography over 13 years and downloading 20 hours of sickening footage.

He was jailed for 18 months in December and banned from having unsupervised contact with any child under 16.

Horn appealed the severity of his jail term which was reduced to ten months by three High Court judges including Justice Fulford.

The senior judge and two colleagues ruled that Horn had not breached his trust as a teacher because his crimes did not involve his pupils.

They also said the Sexual Offences Prevention Order which banned him from unsupervised contact with children was unfair.

The judges also quashed the £100 victim surcharge and said it had been unlawfully imposed because some of Horn’s crimes happened before it came into force.

In their judgement Judge Fulford and his two colleagues ruled: 'None of the offences involved a breach of trust as a teacher.'
