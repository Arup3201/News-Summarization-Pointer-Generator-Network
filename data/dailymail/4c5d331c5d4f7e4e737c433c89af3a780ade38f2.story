Guilty: Footballer Lee Hughes was fined £500 for putting his hand between a young woman's legs and lifting her into the air

Footballer Lee Hughes was fined £500 today for putting his hand between a young woman’s legs during a hotel Christmas party and lifting her into the air.

Notts County striker Hughes, 36, who did not know the woman and had not even spoken to her, pleaded guilty at Croydon Crown Court to common assault.

In addition to the fine he was bound over to keep the peace for one year and ordered to pay £120 costs.

Hughes had originally been charged with sexual assault, but after the Crown Prosecution Service consulted the victim his not guilty plea was accepted and the lesser charge preferred.

'This dates back to the third of December last year,' said prosecutor Mr Julius Capon.

'The defendant is a professional footballer and was staying with others in his team at the Aerodrome Hotel.

'There was a fire alarm and everyone had to leave the hotel and assembled in the car park outside.

'The complainant had attended a works function at the hotel, a Christmas party, and was speaking to her friends when the defendant, who had not spoken to her and who she did not know, put his hand between her legs, under her dress and lifted her up into the air.

'The complainant was annoyed and upset and afterwards Mr Hughes tried to hug her and suggested he was having a laugh.

'This was inappropriate and disgraceful conduct,' added Mr. Capon.

The court was not told of Hughes’ previous conviction of causing the death of father-of-four Douglas Graham by dangerous driving in Meriden, Coventry, for which he received six years imprisonment in August 2004 and was released after serving half the sentence.

He had played for West Brom, Coventry City and Kidderminster Harriers before that drink-drive tragedy and since his release has played for Oldham Athletic and Notts County.

Hughes’ lawyer told the court the hotel incident was no more sinister than 'horseplay.'

'This was utterly inappropriate,' the Recorder of Croydon Warwick McKinnon told Hughes, binding him over to keep the peace for twelve months in the sum of £500.

Hughes’ defence team had asked for the case to be listed at 2pm, but arrived two hours early and the case was called on almost immediately.
