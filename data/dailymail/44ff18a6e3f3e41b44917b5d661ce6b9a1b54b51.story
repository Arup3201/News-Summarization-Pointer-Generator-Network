Hundreds of thousands of silverside fish move as one to form one gigantic swirl surrounding a group of divers in the Caribbean Sea.

The shoal creates waves of silver light, swimming inside underwater caves in the Devil’s Grotto off the Cayman Islands.

The small fish believes in strength in numbers, confusing predators as they swim as one big shift.

These amazing photographs were 
captured by Belgian photographer Ellen Cuylaerts, 44, on a diving trip 
to the Devil's Grotto, Cayman Islands.

‘Every year predators and divers await the arrival of the silversides,’ says Ellen, now of Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands.

‘It's
 a beautiful spectacle that I'm able to witness close to home. My love 
for summers in the Cayman Islands has everything to do with the arrival 
of the silver magic.

‘Tarpons and other predators hunt the silversides, but by swimming in unison they can escape and continue to grow bigger.’

Each year millions of these silvery fish arrive in coastal waters between June and August. 

Fascinating sight: The luminous fish create an underwater roof over the divers as they explore the Devil's Grotto, which is home to thousands of the little fish

Protection: The small fish swim together and move in the same direction in order to confuse larger predators luring in the sea caves

The
 average length of a silverside fish is between one and four inches, and
 they hide in underwater grottos until they have grown big enough to 
survive on their own.

Ellen says: ‘It makes you humble to witness nature at its best.

‘Sometimes I lower my camera and just enjoy being in the middle of this spectacle and watch them moving in unison.

‘The first time I dived at this site I fell in love with the light under the water.

‘From
 then on I studied where natural light could reach the bottom, where the
 fish could hide and where the best angles were, all to create the best 
photographs I could and do the environment justice.

‘I keep going back again and again to capture the show and I can't get enough of it.

‘People
 are often surprised by the beauty the oceans hold, and they start to 
care and want to protect our planet, and that is my goal.’
