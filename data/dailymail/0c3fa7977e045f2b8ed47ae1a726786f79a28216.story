A Tennessee newspaper editor has been fired after writing a headline critical of President Obama.

Drew Johnson's editorial, titled, 'Take your jobs plan and shove it, Mr. President: Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough,' was published in the Chattanooga Times Free Press earlier this week when Obama visited the city. 

The timing of the column gave it a national audience it might not otherwise have had. As a result, it went viral online and Johnson,  the editor of the Times Free Press editorial page, has since been let go.

Drew Johnson says he was fired from his job as an editor for the Chattanooga Times Free Press for writing an anti-Obama headline on an editorial

The newspaper said it fired Johnson for violating a policy requiring that last-minute changes to headlines be approved by upper management.

In a statement published to its website on Friday, the paper stated: 'On Monday night, Johnson changed the 
approved headline on his Tuesday editorial from, “Keep your jobs plan to
yourself, Mr. President: Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough 
already” to “Take your jobs plan and shove it, Mr. President: Your 
policies have harmed Chattanooga enough.”

'However, he waited 
until his editor had left for the day before changing the headline,' the statement continued. 'That
is a violation of our clear editing practice, and our trust. He 
admitted the following day that he failed to follow the standard set for
him.'

Johnson claims that the editing policy was implemented after his piece was published earlier this week. 

He says the real reason he was fired was because of pressure on his bosses from Obama's supporters. 

'[The editor] said that she was disappointed in the headline, that she thought it was crass and she'd gotten a lot of complaints by Obama supporters,' he said in an interview with Fox News. 'Today I come into work and am told that I'm fired for violating that policy that wasn't put in place until the day after I wrote the piece.'

The newspaper said it fired Johnson for 'placing a headline on an editorial outside of normal editing procedures'

Johnson said he feels 'confident' that if the headline had referenced former President George W. Bush rather than Obama, that he would still have a job. 

He also pointed out that his headline was not changed online for several hours after the editorial was published to the paper's website. 

'I just became the first person in the history of newspapers to be fired for writing a paper's most-read article,' he tweeted.

The paper pushed back against Johnson's claims that his editors bowed to political pressure.

'Johnson’s firing was not about yielding 
to political pressure,' the paper said in its statement published online, which was not attributed to a specific person. 'He was not fired for writing an editorial 
criticizing President Barack Obama. The body of the editorial was 
approved for publication; only the headline was changed.'

In a clear dig at Johnson, the paper added: 'The only instance when the Times Free Press ever denied Johnson the freedom to present his views was last week when he referred to pornography as a “miracle product” and touted the benefits of pornography stating that if teenagers watched pornography it would result in lower rates of teenage pregnancy.'

This statement was published to the Chattanooga Times Free Press website on Friday:

Contrary to statements made by former Free Press editor Drew Johnson and national media reports, Johnson was told on multiple prior occasions not to make material changes to editorials or headlines once they were approved by the editor responsible for the page.

On Monday night, Johnson changed the approved headline on his Tuesday editorial from, “Keep your jobs plan to yourself, Mr. President: Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough already” to “Take your jobs plan and shove it, Mr. President: Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough.”

However, he waited until his editor had left for the day before changing the headline. That is a violation of our clear editing practice, and our trust. He admitted the following day that he failed to follow the standard set for him.

The language he chose was vulgar and not appropriate for this newspaper. Even Johnson himself admitted that the headline was “harsh and perhaps crass to a fault” in an editorial he wrote for this Sunday, which will not run.

Johnson’s firing was not about yielding to political pressure. He was not fired for writing an editorial criticizing President Barack Obama. The body of the editorial was approved for publication; only the headline was changed.

The newspaper has allowed Johnson to write his opinions freely and without censorship during the time he worked here – even when he wrote about very controversial topics that many readers complained about. In the past year we have printed at least 46 editorials critical of Obama on the Free Press page.

In fact the only instance when the Times Free Press ever denied Johnson the freedom to present his views was last week when he referred to pornography as a “miracle product” and touted the benefits of pornography stating that if teenagers watched pornography it would result in lower rates of teenage pregnancy.

The Times Free Press values having two editorial pages to express both conservative and liberal views. We encourage differing viewpoints and dissent, we believe having competing views makes community stronger. We expect those debates to be respectful.
