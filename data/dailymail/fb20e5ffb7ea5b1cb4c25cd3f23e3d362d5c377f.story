Exposed: A devastating report today reveals how mishandling of foreign criminals costs £1bn a year

A devastating report today reveals the £1billion-a-year failure by successive governments to police Britain’s borders and deport even the most dangerous foreign criminals.

According to Westminster’s spending watchdog, foreign offenders are able to walk into the country unchecked, commit new offences – then cheat removal on human rights grounds once their jail terms are complete.

Incredibly, the Home Office has lost track of 760 of the 4,200 foreign criminals who had been freed back on to our streets by the end of March 2014 pending their removal. It includes 58 ‘high harm’ individuals, a category that includes rapists, killers and drug dealers.

The ’appalling’ annual cost to the taxpayer of each foreign criminal is £70,000 – or a total of between £770million and £1.04billion a year.

The National Audit Office (NAO) launched an investigation to find out if improvements had been made since the 2006 foreign prisoner scandal, when 1,000 were released without being considered for deportation. It found:

The 48-page report found failings at every stage of the system.

In theory, a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to more than 12 months for a crime in their homeland can be turned away at the border.

Yet the Home Office is relying on a Warning Index system that is more than a decade out of date, often fails to work properly and is based on ad hoc information sharing agreements with other countries.

In 2006, the Labour government declined to join up to a Europe-wide information sharing regime, known as the Schengen Information System, that would have given access to alerts on known criminals.

It leaves Britain as one of only four countries out of 32 in the European Economic Area that cannot access the data. Ministers are now planning to join later this year.

NAO officials estimate as many as 1,400 of the 12,250 foreign offenders living in the UK at the end of March 2014 could have been turned away, had their offending histories been known.

Police are also failing to take action when they stop a foreign national. There is a separate computer system, known as ECRIS, which the UK does have access to – but can only be used when a suspect is already inside the UK’s borders.

In only three out of every ten cases are officers bothering to use it. This means that inmates who had a criminal record at home – who could have been detained and deported, based on their offending history – were allowed to remain in the UK, and potentially commit new crimes. The NAO estimates that simply carrying out proper checks could save the taxpayer £70million a year.

Jail: Bullwood Hall in Essex, which holds only foreign inmates. Each one costs the taxpayer £70,000

The shambles continues even after a foreign offender has been convicted and sent to prison. The NAO found a ‘lack of urgency’ in the system and poor information sharing.

Staff referring cases to the Home Office to start the removals process have to ‘send paper forms that are faxed’ because the IT systems are incompatible. Similar bureaucracy is hindering the hunt for the 760 criminals who have absconded after being freed from jail, often pending an appeal against deportation on human rights grounds.

Officials are only allowed to request 250 individual checks to HMRC for information on whether the criminals may have turned up elsewhere in the tax or benefits system.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of Westminster’s public accounts committee, said: ‘I am astounded that the number of foreign nationals in prisons has increased to 10,649 since 2006 and that, of those released, 760 currently waiting to be deported have disappeared and around 150 are thought not to have been considered for deportation.

‘It’s appalling that only 30 per cent of potential foreign national offenders in custody were searched on immigration databases to see if they had committed crimes overseas.

‘It beggars belief that the Home Office and Ministry of Justice are managing the removal of foreign national offenders without knowing basic costs and how best to target their resources.’

Tory MP Philip Hollobone, a long-standing critic of the failure to deport foreign criminals, said the public would be ‘staggered’ by the revelations. He added: ‘My view is that if you are a foreign national who commits a crime in the UK, you should be caught, convicted and sentenced with your sentence served back in your own country at the expense of your fellow nationals.

‘If their countries won’t take them, then their embassies should be sent the bill. All such individuals should be banned from ever returning to our shores.’

Despite its own leading role in the debacle, Labour attacked the Government’s record.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of Westminster’s public accounts committee, said the situation 'beggars belief'

Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘David Cameron made a commitment to reduce the number of foreign prisoners and to deport more of them, but yet again he has failed to deliver.’

The number of foreign criminals kicked out last year was 5,097 – an improvement on 2006, but down from the high of 5,613 in 2008-09.Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘Foreign nationals who fundamentally abuse our hospitality by committing crime should be in no doubt of our resolute approach in seeking their removal.

‘The countless appeals and re-appeals lodged by criminals attempting to cheat the system cost us all money and are an affront to British justice. That is why we are putting a stop to that abuse through the Immigration Act.

‘New powers came into force this week to cut the number of grounds on which criminals can appeal their deportation and to end the appeals conveyor belt in the courts. They will build on the measures we introduced in the summer which are already speeding up the deportation process.’

ANALYSIS: Chaotic system that cost Alice her life

Today's revelations raise chilling new questions about cases such as that of murdered 15-year-old Alice Gross.

Alice’s suspected killer Arnis Zalkalns – found hanged a week after the schoolgirl’s body was discovered in the River Brent last month – was able to waltz into the UK despite having a conviction in Latvia for murdering his wife.

He then slipped through the net a second time when he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of indecently assaulting a teenage girl in West London in 2009. In total, he is believed to have walked in and out of the country more than 20 times without being stopped.

When the scandal first broke, Whitehall officials pointed the finger of blame at poor information sharing by our EU neighbours.

Yet, according to the National Audit Office, there is masses of information available on foreign criminals which Britain is simply not bothering to access.

This includes the so-called Schengen Information System, which Labour opted not to join in 2006 – despite signing us up to a raft of other EU justice initiatives. Of the 32 members of the European Economic Area, we are one of only four countries not to take part in a regime which offers alerts on known foreign criminals.

Which, in turn, raises the disturbing prospect that information was available that might have allowed Zalkalns to be turned away at the border – but nobody bothered to request it. Even accounting for EU edicts on free movement, there would have been a powerful case for refusing him entry and preventing the horrors which followed.

Meanwhile, what of the Met’s failure to uncover Zalkalns’s past when he was arrested in 2009 – which would again have been sufficient grounds to boot him out. Was Zalkalns among the 70 per cent of cases where police do not even bother to do a search, when they apprehend a foreign national?

What is certain is that, eight years on from the 2006 foreign prisoner scandal, this country remains one of the most hospitable in Europe for the continent’s worst criminals.
