It is a spectacular sight: a Spitfire, the famed RAF warplane which won the Battle of Britain, swooping in mid-air.

Alongside it, another iconic British military aircraft - the revolutionary harrier jump jet that helped defeat Argentina in the Falklands War in 1982.

And nearby two fearsome, and notorious, weapons used by Nazi Germany to bring death and destruction to the streets of London and the south-east during the last days of the Second World War – the V-1 ‘doodlebug’ flying bomb and the V-2 rocket.

The military hardware, used to devastating effect in conflicts during the last 100 years, are the centrepieces of the Imperial War Museum after a £40million transformation.

Along with a T-34 tank and a Reuters news agency Land Rover destroyed by rocket fire in Gaza, there are nine objects suspended or positioned in the dramatic new central atrium to correspond with displays on different floors.

The museum, which puts the stories of human conflict at its heart, tells the history of the last century of war.

Tomorrow the Duke of Cambridge will reopen London’s Imperial War Museum and unveil its spectacular new First World War Galleries, supported by the Daily Mail and the generosity of its army of readers.

Prince William will be accompanied by Viscount Rothermere, the publisher of the Mail and the chairman of the IWM Foundation. It will reopen to the public on Saturday.

The museum, which has been completely closed for the last six months, has been overhauled to coincide with the centenary of the Great War, which left almost a million British soldiers dead.

Barely a family up and down the country was untouched by tragedy during the conflict of 1914-18, when men left their homes for the horror of the trenches to defeat Kaiser Wilhelm II's troops.

The new First World War galleries are three times the size of the old ones and house 1,300 objects, including weapons and uniforms. They will explain why and how men from across the globe marched off to war – millions never returning.

But many visitors will find the small, personal objects most moving, for instance diaries, letters and the wallet of a soldier killed in battle which holds faded photos of his wife and children.

Visitors to the newly refurbished Imperial War Museum can look at exhibits such as these which show the different uniforms, including a British uniform, left, and a French uniform, right, worn by servicemen during the conflict. Diane Lees, Director-General of IWM, hopes the experience will help visitors learn 'the terrible strain the war placed on people and communities'

Multimedia displays capture the vast tragedy of the Battle of the Somme, which saw 20,000 British soldiers killed in one day.

Visitors can walk into a ‘trench’ with images of life on the frontline beamed onto walls surrounding them – taking them on a journey back 100 years.

But the museum will also tell the story of warfare over the last century – including the Second World War, the Falklands and the so-called ‘War on Terror’ which began at the beginning of the 21st Century.

Hundreds of new objects have been added to the displays including the including a piece of the World Trade Center destroyed in the 9/11 terror attacks, a Desert Hawk drone and the suitcase of a Jewish couple who died in Auschwitz.

Director-general Diane Lees said: ‘The atrium will have a major ‘wow’ factor. It’s a beautiful space, really cathedral-like.

‘Each of the objects on display will give a voice to the people who created them, used them or cared for them and reveal stories not only of destruction, suffering and loss, but also endurance, innovation, duty and devotion, comradeship and love.’

The museum was founded in 1917, as the war still raged, to preserve the stories of those who fought and died.

Records show that the largest personal donations were £1,000 from Lord Rothermere, co-founder of the Daily Mail, and £500 from the soap magnate Sir William Lever.

The first Lord Rothermere, who lost two of his three sons in the Great War, donated the museum site to the nation in 1930.

The new galleries are expected to see visitor numbers rise by 30 pc to 1.3million each year, reinforcing the Imperial War Museum's position as the world's pre-eminent museum of modern warfare.

Visitors look at exhibits displayed in the First World War Gallery which convey what life was like on the frontline during the Battle of the Somme. Objects on display range from weapons, uniforms and equipment to diaries, letters, keepsakes and trinkets, photographs, film and art

The museum was completely closed for six months while the restoration took place and was re-opened today after a £40million refurbishment. In total there will be more than 1,300 objects on display such as this tank, left, and many more that have never been seen before
