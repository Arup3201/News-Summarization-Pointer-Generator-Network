With help from a NASA astronaut, Space Mountain opened in January 1975 at Disney's Magic Kingdom park in Orlando, Florida.

The idea began with Walt Disney in the 1960s, but the technology did not exist to bring his vision to life.

Later, when the attraction was given the green light, Mercury 9 and Gemini 5 astronaut Gordon Cooper joined the Space Mountain creative team as a consultant.

He wanted to make sure that the attraction incorporated information gleaned during NASA’s early space missions and that the experience felt like actual space flight.

His valuable input has made Space Mountain a favorite at the Disney Park for over 35 years.

Disneyland didn't get their Space Mountain until 1977, more than two years after Magic Kingdom got theirs in 1975.

These pictures were taken at the Orlando park as the ride was being built in 1974.

Today, Space Mountain exists at all five Magic Kingdom-style Disney Parks around the world.

With the spires of Cinderella's Castle in the distance, where's the fairy godmother when you need her? No magic spells here... just backbreaking construction work!

Inspired by Rapunzel? The vertical towers and heavy machinery look more like an industrial park than something out of the Magic Kingdom...

Taking shape: As the concentric are constructed, the magic slowly begins to appear

One block after another: It¿s hard to place these concrete blocks in the finished construction - but that's Disney magic for you!

Launchpad: Space Mountain's distinctive circular shape is evident as the building work continues at a pace

Trucking in the magic: fairy dust, wishes, and hundreds of metres of concrete!

Building the future: The Magic Kingdom's early success, and its unexpected popularity with teens and young adults, prompted Disney to begin planning thrill rides for the new park shortly after its opening in October 1971

Tried and tested: The success of Walt Disney World's Space Mountain prompted designers to revisit their original plan to build one for Disneyland

Twisted steel tracks: Space Mountain at Disneyland was designed by Bill Watkins of Walt Disney Imagineering, including a tubular steel track design

Not so magical with the lights on: The track and steel construction frame are all clearly visible. It's only when the lights are off and clever sound and visual effects are brought in that the rides true potential can be realised

As close to space as you'll get: The ride promises riders the chance to 'whiz past shooting stars and celestial satellites during your thrilling space ride - you'll witness streaking orbs of light, wayward comets and migrant meteors'

How it is today: 38 years on and after numerous refits and renovations Space Mountain is as popular and as wild as ever
