It's been hailed as everything from crazy and creepy to 'like a plot out of Love Actually'.

But either way, one woman's mission to track down a man she let get away, mostly thanks to the help of strangers.

It all started on December 23 at a bar called The Light Horse in Old Town Alexandria, North Virginia.

'Courtney', who did not want to release her surname, was on a pre-Christmas night out with some girlfriends when she met 'Ben', whose surname she didn't manage to catch.

Virginia woman 'Courtney' left 'Ben' at a bar after an amazing time getting to know each other - so she set out to find the mystery man

Courtney met Ben at this bar, The Light Horse in Old Town Alexandria, on December 23, but ran off with some girlfriends without exchanging details

The pair talked about everything - 'religion, faith, morality, culture and how do you define culture in society', according to Courtney.

'Definitely not the things you just randomly talk to someone about in bar!' she told Fox 5.

'It was an extensive conversation in the middle of a DJ playing, a hundred people dancing all around us.'

But Courtney messed up.

She ran off with her pals and never exchanged details with her potential soul mate.

Consumed with regret and uncertainty, Courtney kicked into gear after Christmas - she had to find Ben, whom she described as 'probably early to mid-30s, white male with brown hair, beard, brown eyes, average build, slightly athletic'.

She photocopied 75 signs appealing for 'Ben (from the Light Horse)'.

Call me!: Courtney said she posted up 60 photocopies of a sign she wrote appealing for Ben to get in touch

Courtney's Twitter account @OldTownCourtney was quickly filled with messages from people wanting to know more about 'this Ben'

Courtney also embarked on a few media interviews, hoping that it would help her in her quest to find Ben

'I made the wrong choice on Dec. 23rd. Call me! Courtney' the signs read, along with her cell phone number.

Courtney stuck up 60 of them all over town, mostly down King St, she said.

The old-fashioned 'looking for love' notes were coupled with a new-age approach - a Twitter account called @OldTowbCourtney and the hashtag #FindBen.

She also conducted a few media interviews, in which she said she 'isn't crazy' and just 'fun and unpredictable'.

Thanks to help from strangers who got involved with the search, Courtney received numerous tips as to how to find Ben

Many tried to help Courtney, calling it romantic and re-Tweeting her posts.

Others said that Ben should consider legal action.

Then, about 2pm on January 2, Courtney Tweeted that she had found Ben.

'!I found Ben! To respect Benâ€™s privacy, I wonâ€™t be taking any more interviews. Thank you everyone for the support in my quest to #FindBen !!!'

While many outlets, including The Mail Online, have reached out to Courtney to find the ending of her fairytale, she has since shut down her Twitter accounts and switched the cell phone number on her signs to voice mail.

The end? Courtney confirmed on Twitter on January 2 that she had indeed found Ben, but refused to elaborate on the outcome of their meeting
