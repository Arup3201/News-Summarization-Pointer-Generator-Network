The racist hazing of a Massachusetts high school football player prompted school officials on Monday to forfeit the remainder of their season, but now some locals are up in arms and demanding that the team should play on, while others have accused the victim’s family of being ‘trouble makers.’

At the center of the whole unpleasant affair is Isaac Phillips, 13, who is in the eighth grade and plays on the Lunenburg High School football team, who are nicknamed the Blue Knights.

On Friday morning, he and his family awoke to find that someone had painted a racial slur - ‘Knights don’t need n******’ - on the side of their home. 

Isaac Phillips, 13, has been the victim of racist hazing which he and his family believe has been carried out by some of his teammates on the Lunenburg High School football team

‘I don't really understand why someone would even do something like this,’ Phillips told WCVB-TV. ‘I have two younger brothers and another sister. This is our house, this is where we live. Eventually, they're going to see it.’

The teenager's mother is white and his father is half black.

According to the boy’s parents, this isn’t the first instance of their son Phillips being a victim of hazing by some of his teammates, in the past his cleats have been thrown in the trash and the tires on his bicycle slashed.

At a team meeting on Friday the players were given an opportunity to come forward with information about the graffiti incident, but chose not to.

Isaac's parents, Anthony Phillips and Andrea Brazier, claim they are being treated as trouble makers because they have spoken out about their son being bullied

As a consequence Friday night’s match was postponed and on Monday, Lunenburg Public Schools Superintendent Loxi Jo Calmes announced that the remainder of the school's football season would be forfeited.

That decision prompted an angry reaction from some locals including a former coach who launched a petition to get the remaining games reinstated, including the popular Thanksgiving game.

‘I was so angry - this is so unfair to a lot of those kids,’ Matthew Roderick told Telegram.com. 

On Monday night he set up a petition ‘Loxi Jo Calmes: Let Them Play!’ on change.org.

‘I grew up here and mentored a lot of those kids. The whole team shouldn't be punished with no facts. I was disgusted that innocent kids were being punished and the majority did not do anything.’

Unfortunately some locals have chosen to blame the Phillips family for Ms Calmes’ decision to cancel the rest of the football season.

Isaac’s father Anthony Phillips, who owns a local construction company, has said he was listening to a local radio call-in about the incident when one of the callers blamed his family for causing all the problems.

‘We did nothing wrong - it has been turned around like we did something wrong and we're the victims,’ he said.

‘We didn't want any of this stuff. I couldn't sleep last night because I felt awful. Everything happened so fast. We only expected a little bit of local attention after it happened. We're not vicious parents out to ruin the town. I'm hoping in the next few days someone steps forward.’

The graffiti, which is being investigated by the FBI as a hate crime, is just the latest accusation of racism that the team is facing. In two different games earlier this month, referees reported players using racial epithets against opposing players.

In the weeks prior to the graffiti incident, Anthony Phillips said he spoke to the coaches about his son's treatment but they told him that they doubted any players were involved.

He believes that if a senior playing on the team is responsible for the graffiti and the remaining games are reinstated then it sets a bad example. 

Isaac and his father attended a vigil on Monday night from townsfolk who wanted to show their support for them, but others have labelled the family trouble makers

‘If he plays that game and it never comes out and he is not held accountable and goes off to college, an extreme bigot is released into society,’ he said.

Anthony Phillips has said that the unfortunate incident means his son no longer wants to attend Lunenburg High because of the harassment.

‘He doesn't want to go to the school anymore. He's beyond upset about the whole situation,’ he said.Police issued a statement on Saturday saying the incident was under investigation by both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Worcester District Attorney’s Office.

‘As a community we offer our deepest support to the player and his family, and want to emphasize that Lunenburg is an inclusive, supportive community and this is not the sort of behavior we foster or tolerate. The nature of this crime has deeply impacted the team, the school and the entire community,’ the statement read.
