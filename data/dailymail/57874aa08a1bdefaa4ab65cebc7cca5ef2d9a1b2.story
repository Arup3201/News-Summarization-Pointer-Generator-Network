Nearly 2,000 British tourists took part in the world's biggest food fight in Spain today.

The town of Bunol near Valencia ended up covered in a sea of red mush as revellers threw 130,000 kilos of over-ripe tomatoes at each other.

The local council restricted numbers by charging participants 10 euros (£8.60) to take part in the annual Tomatina festival for the first time ever.
