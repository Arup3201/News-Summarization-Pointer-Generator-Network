France is launching a  counter-attack over fears it's losing its claim as the world's top culinary destination in an 'Anglo-Saxon plot.'

The French government is so concerned they have called on two multi-Michelin-starred chefs to draw up battle plans. They hope to be able to challenge the nations who are  disparaging their cuisine in a bid to 'dethrone' them as global masters of gastronomy.

Star chefs Alain Ducasse and Guy Savoy, who will be putting together a 20-point plan for the special report in January, have admitted that France's global culinary influence 'is no longer the same'.

Foreign minister Laurent Fabius' 'gastrono-diplomacy' drive also includes plans to include radically easing immigration rules for cooks wanting to work with top French chefs, and a project to promote French cuisine in hundreds of embassies around the world.

In the report seen by The Daily Telegraph, the chefs said: ''A feeling is setting in that the French, those lovers of good flesh, can no longer keep quality cuisine in their heritage except in certain good bistros that remain unknown or far from tourist paths.'

'We must react. How can French cuisine and wine re-enchant the world?

'We must start by highlighting our strong points and teaching the French to love their local soil and their country anew.'

'There is on the part of the Anglo-Saxons an attempt to dethrone us, to say that France used to be good but that it's lost its edge,' added Philippe Faure, a former French ambassador and ex-chairman of the Gault & Millau food guide.

The chefs warned that citizens of France were beginning to feel their heritage of quality cuisine would only remain in good bistros far away from tourist traps

As part of the drive, the ministry will launch the Good France project in March which will see 1,000 chefs of different nationalities serve French food and wine in restaurants and embassies across five continents. The elaborate four course meals aim to emulate those of celebrated 19th century cook and culinary ambassador Georges August Escoffier.

Unesco has named France's 'gastronomic meal' a world treasure and the country still welcomes more tourists than any other nation.

But there are signs that its proud culinary reputation is beginning to diminish. 

Not a single French restaurant was made it into the top ten of this year's World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards which was instead dominated by Spain, the UK, USA, Brazil with Denmark as number one. Only five made it into the awards at all.

The chefs claim the awards were unfairly influenced by the 'players that subsidise it' but admitted France's  mid-to-low range restaurants, particularity in tourist traps like Mont Saint Michel or the banks of the Seine, let the country down.

The pair have now put together a long list of recommendations for regaining the country's culinary crown. 

They include restricting the number of starters and main dishes to three to ensure high quality, and ensuring only local, fresh, non-industrial ingredients are used. 'Red-tape' around wine and draconian alcohol advertising laws should also be cut by the government.

Stricter criteria should also be introduced on food with the 'home-made' label in restaurants which currently allows most frozen and vacuum-packed food.

Finally, the chefs propose that winners of the 2015 edition of France's coveted Michelin guide should be announced in a star-studded event at the foreign ministry.
