Detective Inspector Jim Munro, investigating officer in the case, said: 'We believe this was a targeted attack'

Detective Inspector Jim Munro, investigating officer in the case, said: 'We believe this was a targeted attack.

‘It's not clear what the substance is yet but initial thoughts are that it's some kind of high-strength detergent.

‘An investigation is underway to try and establish a motive for the attack.’

Officers earlier said they believed the teenager was deliberately targeted and ruled out a case of mistaken identity.

Kirstie Bennett, who lives across the road from Kerry Stevens' house where the incident occurred, said: 'I can't imagine why anyone would want to do this to anyone let alone a young woman.

'I don't know Vikki but she's a pretty girl. I think she was a friend of Kerry's.

‘It's horrific to think her life has been changed forever.

‘I heard something had happened here on the news and I told my mum to stay in the house.

‘I haven't spoken to Kerry since, but I know it must have been Vikki as her car is still there.’

Another neighbour said: ‘It's a shock - you don't expect anything like that to happen round here.

‘This is a quiet street, lots of families, nothing ever goes on.’

Another, who gave her name as Claire, said: ‘I think there was another man stood behind her, I think he was hit by some of the stuff.

‘The family who live there don't have much to do with the rest of the street, they keep themselves to themselves.

‘The first I knew of it was when the police arrived.’

The £115,000 terraced house was still cordoned off yesterday morning with the front door and porch covered in a large blue sheet.

Neighbour Gillian Smith, 58, said: ‘I just can't imagine the pain this girl must have gone though.

‘I am praying that she makes a full recovery.’

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: ‘We were called at 3pm to MacDonald Close in Tividale on April 15.

‘A woman was found with 25 per cent partial thickness burns to her face, neck, chest and arms.

‘Her burns were treated with dressing before she was taken to hospital.

‘There was a second patient who was a man with less serious burns to his head and chest, he was also taken to the same hospital.

‘At the scene were two ambulances and one paramedic car.’

Acid attack victim: Katie Piper

In March 2008, Katie Piper's life changed for ever when she became the victim of a horrific acid attack as she walked along a busy London road.

The former television presenter and model was just 24-years-old when she met a man over the internet who eventually ordered an accomplice to throw sulphuric acid in her face.

Daniel Lynch, a martial arts enthusiast, gave Miss Piper's details to Stefan Sylvestre who threw sulphuric acid in her face on a busy London road in March 2008.

Miss Piper suffered serious burns to her face and chest in the attack and was left blinded in one eye. She has since had skin grafts and an operation to restore her vision. 

The attack was caught on CCTV and both Lynch and Sylvestre were later arrested and jailed.

Lynch was handed two life sentences, and will serve a minimum of 16 years, and Sylvestre received a life sentence and will spend a minimum of 12 years in prison.

Another woman to be targeted in an acid attack is Naomi Oni.

In December 2012 Victoria's Secret
 worker Naomi, 21, was left scarred for life after Mary Konye doused
 her with concentrated sulphuric acid.

Konye
 disguised herself in a Muslim veil to stalk her friend - who she was 
jealous of - as she left the Victoria's Secret store in Westfield 
shopping centre in Stratford, east London, where she worked.

Shortly before Miss Oni reached her home in Dagenham, Essex, Konye hurled acid at her victim's face.

Miss
 Oni suffered serious burns to her face and chest, lost her hair and 
eyelashes, and required skin graft surgery to cover the burns.

Konye was convicted of the attack and was jailed for 12 years at London's Snaresbrook Crown Court last month.
