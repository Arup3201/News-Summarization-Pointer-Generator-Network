A furious row between a parish council chairman and a woman ex-chairman he was said to have mischievously enrolled on a dating website, is to be aired in public.

A Crown Court judge today stepped into the harassment dispute between Councillor Douglas Staples and former councillor-turned-vigilante Marilyn Ray.

The 62-year-old chairman of Enborne Parish Council, who has had a restraining order made against him to stop harassing 65-year-old Mrs Ray, successfully applied to have his conviction quashed.

Here we go again: Douglas Staples has won the right to a retrial over allegations that he harassed Marilyn Ray

Judge Angela Morris agreed that Mr Staples’ guilty plea to charges of harassment should be rescinded and that he should face a retrial at magistrates’ court when all the evidence about the dating website will be heard again.

The councillor successfully argued that he was given poor legal advice and was put under pressure by his former legal team into pleading guilty on the day of his trial.

Judge Morris allowed his guilty plea to be vacated and ordered the case be returned to the magistrates’ court for retrial.

She concluded: 'All I have read and heard in this case there is a doubt as to whether the applicant was properly informed about the nature of the charges and the nature of the offence.'

The 62-year-old told Judge Morris, sitting at Reading Crown Court, that he was pushed into signing a document that stated under his own free will he had decided to enter a guilty plea.

'I didn’t want to sign it, but I signed it,' he said.

'I was pushed into signing it.'

Coun. Staples is said to have fallen out with Mrs Ray after they had sat on the committee together for Enborne Parish Council, near Newbury, Berkshire.

He took over as chairman from Mrs Ray but the relationship turned sour when she bombarded the council with more than 70 complaints about his behaviour and procedural council matters over a five-year period.

She had resigned from her position as chairman on health grounds in January 2006 but continued to attend regular meetings in the capacity of a villager and took notes.

After five years of complaints Coun. Staples allegedly registered Mrs Ray of Enborne Street, with Match.com and two other dating agencies.

The father-of-one also allegedly requested a fire safety assessment from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service about Mrs Ray’s heritage-status cottage and was accused of misrepresenting their response.

Both harassment incidents - which Coun. Staples had previously admitted in court - happened between October 26, 2010 and April 14, 2011.

Coun. Staples of Vanners Lane, Enborne, was originally handed a bill for more than £700 pounds in fines and costs and made the subject of a restraining order.

The new re-trial will be heard at Reading Magistrates’ Court for a date to be fixed.
