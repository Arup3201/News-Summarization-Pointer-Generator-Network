A U.S. tourist detained in Aruba after the suspected death of his travel companion took out a $1.5 million accidental death policy on the Maryland woman days before they travelled to the island, it has been revealed.

Gary Giordano, 50, who claims that Robyn Gardner disappeared two weeks ago as they snorkelled off an isolated beach, was named as a beneficiary on the insurance policy.

According to a police source, Giordano purchased a more expensive one-year policy instead of a more commonly purchased five year policy.

Insurance: Gary Giordano took out an accidental death policy on missing woman Robyn Gardner, which named him as a beneficiary, days before their trip to the Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba

The American Express accidental policy is being investigated by police in Aruba and the FBI.

The details emerged as police prepare to begin an extensive search for the body of the 35-year-old woman, who they believe is dead.

The search will centre on the southern part of the Dutch Caribbean island near where Ms Gardner was reported missing.

Giordano claims that his travel companion was pulled away by ocean currents on August 2 while they were snorkelling. The pair had come to Aruba on July 31 for a short vacation.

Giordano, a 50-year-old business owner from Gaithersburg, Maryland, has been detained on suspicion of involvement in her death.

Being held: A judge on Monday granted a request from Aruban prosecutors to extend the detention of Giordano for 16 days

Missing: Robyn Gardner disappeared while on holiday in Aruba with 50-year-old Gary Giordano who is being held by police

On Monday he was ordered to remain in an Aruban jail for another 16 days while police investigate 'serious inconsistencies' in his account of events.

Giordano, who court documents show has a history of domestic violence, has not been charged but remains the only suspect in the case.

His attorney has said he had nothing to do with her disappearance and has called for his release from jail.

Officers having been tracing the movements of Giordano in the hours before Ms Gardner's disappearance, but said they have had trouble identifying him in surveillance video because he frequently changes his toupees.

Video shows the pair at the Rum Beef Bar & Grill in the Baby Beach area of the island where Ms Gardner went missing.

Restaurant staff have told investigators that the woman seemed woozy while they ate.

Surveillance footage also shows Giordano in his rental car at the back of the restaurant, but the car had tinted windows so no one else in the vehicle can be seen.

Police said that they found blood on a rock behind the dive shop at the restaurant.
