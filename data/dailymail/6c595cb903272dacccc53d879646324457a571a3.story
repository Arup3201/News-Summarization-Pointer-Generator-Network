Fathers who have a good relationship with their children and are happy to help out with household chores have happier marriages, a new study has revealed.

But the survey, conducted by researchers from the University of Missouri and Utah State University, also warned of the pitfalls of divvying up chores between husband and wife, finding that marriages were happier when couples worked together on each job.

Men, traditionally, are made responsible for heavier jobs such as taking out the dustbin, while women tend to take on chores such as washing up and hoovering. This, say researchers, is a mistake.Â 

Happy: Couples who do the housework together are more likely to have a good relationship

'We found that it didn't matter who did what, but how satisfied 
people were with the division of labour,' said Brigham Young University 
professor Erin Holmes.

'We found that when wives are doing work together
 with their husbands, they are more satisfied with the division of 
labor.'

The study, which was published in the Journal of Family Issues, looked at how 160 couples handled housework and child-rearing 
duties in an attempt to discover what contributed to the 
quality of a married relationship.

The quality of the fathers' relationship with their children was found to be the single most important factor, followed by willingness to do the housework alongside their wives.

'For women, their husband having a good relationship with the kids means that the parents are probably going to have a better relationship,' Holmes 
said.

The study measured fatherly involvement in a number of ways including playing 
with children, engaging in shared interests and providing teaching moments.

Pitfall: Those who split chores or who don't divide them equally will find marriage harder to cope with

Quality time: Fathers who have a good relationship with their children have happier marriages

'Something as simple as reading a book with your children every 
night and talking with them about their day can really go a long way," 
said Adam Galovan, a graduate of Utah's Brigham Young University who co-authored the study.

Most of the parents were between the ages of 25 and 30 and all of the couples had a child age 5 or younger.

'This stage of life, where couples have young children, is potentially really challenging for couples,' Holmes said.

Previous research by Holmes showed that both husbands and 
wives dramatically increase their household tasks during the transition 
to parenthood.

Typically fathers do twice as much housework after the first
 baby arrives. Mothers, however, do about five times more housework than 
before.

'When wives are satisfied with the division of labor, both spouses report higher marital quality,' Holmes said.

In other words, couples who clean together, stay together.
