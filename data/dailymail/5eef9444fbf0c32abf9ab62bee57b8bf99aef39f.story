Police are seizing almost one cannabis plant a minute in Britain – with more than 1,000 a week found by one police force alone.

A production boom has turned thousands of suburban homes into cannabis farms.

Officers carried out 17 raids an hour across Britain last year, swooping on more than 100,000 growers, ranging from small suppliers who have converted their lofts and garages, to huge marijuana factories.

Uncovered: Some of the plants officers in Manchester have seized as part of Operation Cairo. Officers seized 51,000 plants in 2013 - one plant was confiscated every 10 minutes

In total more than 500,000 plants were 
recovered, almost one a minute. In addition, 3,779kg of herbal cannabis 
and 4,155kg of resin was seized. 

Home Office figures show the biggest 
hauls were in the West Midlands where 61,177 plants were recovered. In 
2008 the average number of cannabis farms discovered every month was 
252, rising to a monthly 656 in 2012.

Greater
 Manchester was named as the cannabis capital of Britain with almost a thousand 
plants seized by police every week, it has emerged.

Just 2,900 more plants were taken off the streets of London – despite the capital's population being four times higher.

Greater Manchester Police made more than 9,000 drugs seizures in the region in 2012/13, including 58.9kg of cocaine – a six-fold rise on the previous year.

They also seized 42kg of amphetamines and 90kg of heroin, compared with 5.5kg of heroin in the previous year. 

But
 the biggest haul was in cannabis. In addition to the 51,000 plants 
seized, officers also seized 217kg of herbal cannabis and 131kg of 
cannabis resin.

The figures also show the force is taking a gram of cannabis resin off the streets on average every four minutes, a gram of heroin every six minutes, and a gram of cocaine every nine minutes.

The news follows a huge push by Greater Manchester Police to smash drugs networks, which has seen a series of high-profile raids on dealers.

Greater Manchester Police made more drugs seizures in total than any police force outside London.

One of the GMP's most successful ever drugs crackdowns, Operation Cairo, was launched last year and saw 45 criminals jailed for a total of 144 years in prison.

The operation was launched in Cheetham Hill because the area had become the go-to area for users across the region.

Daytime dealers were rooted out after police went undercover as addicts, using dial-a-drug numbers with nicknames like the 'Snickers Line' and the 'Snowy Line' to buy cannabis for as little as £5 a wrap.

One man was arrested earlier this year after cannabis plants worth £250,000 were seized from a house in Wigan.

And in October, five men from Greater Manchester were jailed after police smashed an £8m cannabis ring.

Police have described the conviction as 'biggest ever prosecution for cannabis supply in the UK'.

In November, police found a giant cannabis farm spread across two terrace houses in Miles Platting containing £180,000 of the potent herb.

Bosses at a leading charity that supports professionals who work in drug and alcohol treatment, drug education and prevention and criminal justice, says it is vital that funding is not cut for treatment for addicts.

Harry Shapiro from the DrugScope charity said: 'These seizures shouldn’t come as any surprise as Manchester, like other cities, is a hub of the drug culture in the UK. It has been this way since the heroin epidemic of the recession in the 1980s. The culture has been fairly well embedded for some time.'

He added: 'Although overall the drug use is generally on the decline, there are still hotspots and Manchester is clearly one of those.'

 'Manchester is well-served by support organisations, our main concern is over funding for treatment.'

'Local authorities are now in charge of treatment. They are under huge pressure and some are making swingeing cuts. Our concern is that this investment will start to be cut in the next couple of years.'
