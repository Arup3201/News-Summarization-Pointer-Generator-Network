Lewis Hamilton was involved in a series of curt radio exchanges with his team as Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel was the surprise winner of the Malaysian Grand Prix. 

Hamilton’s Mercedes team had threatened to dominate this season but to the great relief of Formula One fans throughout the world — including some patriotic Hamilton supporters — they have been caught up. 

Hamilton, who finished second to head the championship standings by three points, exchanged words with his obviously jittery engineers on the pit wall.

He questioned their choice of tyres and told them not to talk to him while he was cornering. 

Apart from saying some of the messages were ‘confusing’, Hamilton refrained from criticising the team after the race and admitted that even if Mercedes had got their strategy right, Vettel ‘would still have been hard to beat’.

INCIDENT 1

Lap 39 — Hamilton complains about choice of tyres:

Hamilton: This is the wrong tyre, man.

His engineer replies they had no choice.

Engineer: The other was well used.

INCIDENT 2

Lap 40 — with Vettel picking up the pace, Hamilton vents his anger again:

Hamilton: I can hear you (in response to one engineer trying to grab a quick word.) I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing. Paddy (Lowe, team technical chief) says I might be doing another stop.

Engineer: That was just miscommunication. That was just chatter.

INCIDENT 3

Lap 42 — Hamilton snaps after being distracted:

Engineer: Lewis you are scheduled to catch Vettel with five laps remaining.

Hamilton: Don’t try and talk to me through the corners, man, I nearly went off.
