Jamie Redknapp told me his knee man, Richard Steadman, was the best in the business but our first meeting wasn’t quite what I was expecting.

‘Steady’ makes his judgments based on what he sees inside the knee during surgery and also on what he feels by touching the knee.

Agony: Bullard is helped off after suffering another injury in 2009 with Hull

I thought I was there for surgery so when, during our first meeting, he turned off the light in the room and began feeling my knee, I thought ‘Is this guy a bit of a weirdo?’ Luckily, he was not. In fact, he was as good as he was cracked up to be.

Soon after surgery, my physio Luke and I unwrapped the heavy bandaging on my knee. It was a horror show.

My knee was five times its normal size, there was an enormous scar stretched right across it and it was bright red. I was close to tears and said to Luke: ‘There’s no way I’m coming back from this.’

And then, just at the point where I was feeling like throwing in the towel, a man hopped into the room walking on what looked like two paper-thin, artificial legs.

The curse returns: Bullard was haunted with injuries throughout his career in England

It was as if he’d been sent there especially for me.

I was crying by now as I looked up and studied this bloke.

‘F*** this,’ I thought as I watched the guy struggling to adjust to life with no legs. ‘What am I worried about?’
