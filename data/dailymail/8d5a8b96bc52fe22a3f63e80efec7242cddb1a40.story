A teenager has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly hitting a policeman in a stolen Lexus following a two-hour car chase.

The 17-year-old, along with two other teenage boys, allegedly stole two cars in Wynnum and Mount Cotton in east Brisbane before driving south to Logan on Wednesday.

Video of the police chase shows two of the 17-year-olds speed along a road in a dark purple Lexus before mounting a footpath and knocking down a senior constable who had his gun drawn, Nine News reported.

A 17-year-old male has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly hitting a policeman in a stolen car

The teen - with two others - allegedly led police on a two-hour chase in Queensland on Wednesday

The police officer was knocked to the ground by the car. He was taken to hospital with leg and shoulder injuries

The car can then be seen tearing down another road before the two teens inside decide to ditch the vehicle and attempt to escape on foot.

The pair can be seen running through the backyard of a property before entering a park, but a swarm of police quickly apprehend them.

The injured officer was taken to hospital to be treated for leg and shoulder injuries.

Queensland Police’s Tony Wormald said the car’s wheels had been deflated by police stingers.

‘They’ve driven along motorways even though their vehicle has been damaged by the stingers and they’ve put a lot of people’s lives at risk,’ Mr Wormald said.

‘It’s stupid behaviour on their part just for a stolen car.’

A police helicopter following the car via GPS tracked the Lexus to Chambers Flat, south of Logan, which allowed officers initiated the police chase.

A short time before the two teenagers were arrested, a third 17-year-old driving a second vehicle – a white Toyota Camry – crashed into an oncoming car while driving the wrong way down an on ramp.

It is believed the three 17-year-olds were involved in an alleged burglary in Wynnum earlier in the morning.

The driver of the Lexus will appear in Beenleigh Magistrates Court on Thursday charged with attempted murder, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, unlawful use of a motor vehicle, failing to stop a motor vehicle and unlicensed driving.

A second teen has been charged with unlawful use of a motor vehicle, and the third teen was charged with dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, unlawful use and obstructing police. They will also appear in Beenleigh Magistrates Court on Thursday.
