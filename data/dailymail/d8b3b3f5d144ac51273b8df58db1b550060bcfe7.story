Two men have been charged after attempting to rob a Catholic priest following Mass in Chicago.

Deandrea and Markquis Little, 22 and 20, sat through the ceremony before following the 73-year-old into the sacristy at around 8.30am last Monday and demanding money.

Deandrea is alleged to have poked the priest in the head and threatened to hit him before saying he would tell the papers the priest had 'touched us' if anyone found out.

Deandrea Little, 22 (left), and Markquis Little, 20 (right), are accused of threatening a catholic priest after Mass last week in an attempt to get money. Deandrea told the man to keep quiet or he'd tell papers 'you touched us'

According to police reports the pair had carried out a four-year campaign of intimidation against the church in the Back of the Yards area, taking at least $10,000, damaging windows and jumping on the priest's car.

The priest claims to have been giving them $10 or $20 at a time, meaning they visited the building at least 500 times since 2009.

The pair were arrested after the Priest had recognised them sitting at the back of his congregation during the Mass.

The pair are accused of carrying out a four-year campaign of intimidation, taking around $10,000 from the 73-year-old priest over four years (file picture)

Deandrea and Markquis have been charged with intimidation, stalking and attempted robbery and are due to appear in bond court on Monday.

Police would not confirm if the two men were related.

Two years ago another Catholic priest was robbed at his home in Chicago by two armed men.

Reverend Daniel Mallet was beaten up at home by men in 'ninja masks' who forced him to open a safe before stealing $500 meant for the poor.

As the men left they asked Mr Mallet to pray for their sins.
