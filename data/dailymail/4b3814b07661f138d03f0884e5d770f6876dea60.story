PPQ might have made headlines with their red carpet frocks on day one but day two of London Fashion Week proved to be one of the best yet, with Julien Macdonald, Zoe Jordan J.W Anderson and David Koma among the highlights.

Koma, although still in love with architectural sihouettes, toned down his fiercely futuristic aesthetic, adding pale blush pink and bold blue to his palette and combining oriental influences with Riviera stripes.

The result was tough chic with an infusion of elegance - a combination particularly noticeable in his dresses, which he continues to do brilliantly well.

Colour of the season? Blush pink was a popular choice for designers - including Koma

Riviera: Koma's sculptural aesthetic was lent elegance by cool cobalt stripes

Another to unveil a collection crammed with stunning gowns was John Rocha whose beautifully romantic collection bloomed with roses, most of which were splashed across delicate chiffon gowns.

Others appeared in white, blush and black, all high necked and demure although there were a number of sheer efforts that gently subverted Rocha's ladylike look.

Like his daughter Simone, Rocha has an instinct for making women look beautiful and the1950s glamazons that stalked his catwalk in puffed A-line skirts and elegant picture hats most certainly did.

Yet more striking gowns were to be seen at Mark Fast who sent models down the runway in knitted Missoni style gowns and long flowing skirts. But it wasn't all good news.

Fast it seems has no intention of letting last summer's crop top trend go quietly and sent several versions down the catwalk - all of which ended well above the belly button - and like the rest of the collection, came in a choice of acid yellow or grey.

Elegant: John Rocha's ladylike vision for next summer included the liberal use of blowsy cabbage rose print and some coolly pretty gowns in white organza

Vampy: Black lace and chiffon gowns were accessorised with retro picture hats

Stunning: A delicate white chiffon dress was lifted with artful embroidery at John Rocha

Spectacular: A stunning embroidered 1950s style gown from John Rocha

Yellow fever: Grey and acid yellow dominated at knitwear specialist Mark Fast who also appeared to be on a one man mission to keep last summer's crop top trend alive

Although Fast restricted himself to a minimal palette, Ashish, as is his wont, did not. There were sequins, stripes and plenty of slogans as well as some unusual regal headwear which clashed merrily with the sporty feel of the rest of the collection and the bizarre supermarket bags carried by models.

Trousers were baggy and ripped, while the sequinned and sloganed vests betrayed a hint of American style ghetto fabulous. Best of all though, were the dresses which were short and sweet and bound to be everywhere come next summer.

Another to focus on dresses for summer was Henry Holland who showed one of his best collections to date in front of a crowd that included One Direction singer Harry Styles and Kelly Osbourne.

Gone were the pop art prints of seasons past and in their place delicate, accomplished florals including one especially lovely example that combined watercolour blooms with bold thorn-meshed hearts.

Holland's tailoring, not always his strong point, has become a highlight with neatly cropped trousers and perfectly cut shirts in bright blue check among the best in show.

Bright spark: As is his wont, Holland's collection included a rainbow of eye-catching hues

Pretty: Irish designer Orla Kiely unveiled a typically feminine collection replete with puffed skirts and demure details, although her trademark prints were largely absent

Elsewhere, Orla Kiely showed a typically sweet collection of neat separates and demure dresses, lifted with girlishly large pockets, although without the colourful prints that made her name.

Another to impress was newcomer Zeynep Tosun who showed a well thought out collection of cleverly cut dresses in delicate silver silk and striking baroque black.

Equally impressive was fellow fresh face Lug Von Siga whose collection had a jungle feel thanks to liberal use of zebra print and some well-executed tribal totem print.

Glamorous gathering: Abbey Clancey joined actress Anna Kendrick, singer Paloma Faith and fellow warbler Eliza Doolittle front row at Julien Macdonald

London Fashion Week has long been a must-do on the celebrity circuit and this season's shows have proved no exception. Among the most popular was House of Holland, where designer Henry took a bow in front of a crowd that included One Direction singer Harry Styles, Kelly Osbourne, Alexa Chung and Pixie Geldof.

But true to form, the One Direction star couldn't resist a chuckle as he sat in the front row alongside his friend, Radio One DJ, Nick Grimshaw.

Earlier in the day, singer Eliza Doolittle joined model Abbey Clancey and actress Anna Kendrick for Julien Macdonald's ultra-glamorous show. The trio sat together as gown after sparkling gown swept past, with Abbey later declaring that she had her eye on one of the few black numbers on show.

Other celebrities to make London Fashion Week part of their weekend included Jameela Jamil, the Sugababes and TV presenter Laura Whitmore.

Nails were created by Shereen Gayle for Essie. Speaking about the look, she said: ‘We wanted to use more than one nail colour this season, so we choose three.

‘Rather than pairing the floral dresses in the show with something really obvious and feminine we went for a nude called Sand Tropez. Nudes are going to be big next season.

'Everyone’s bored of bold colours now. We’ve done the whole nail art craze and now things have come full circle back to neutrals.

‘We teamed the black dresses with an ivory colour called Merino Cool and a brown shade called Wicked.

'Both are classic and perfectly complement the black looks.’

Ashish's collection was inspired by the idea of a glamorous walk of shame, which was mirrored in the makeup and nails.

Sharon Dowsett created the beauty look using Maybelline. Eyeliner (Maybelline Master Drama Kohl) was grungy and starting to smudge and eyes were brightened with gold eyeshadow (Master Duo Eyeliner) that had dropped onto the cheeks.

Maybelline Colour Tattoo in Gold Leaf (tipped to be a big seller this season) was pressed onto the top of the cheek bones to add sparkle and give the impression of dropped eyeshadow. Lips were nude with just a touch of Maybelline Baby Lips.

Nails, created by Michelle Humphrey, saw Maybelline Color Show in Black Out painted directly onto bare nails in a chipped shape, which was topped with Color Show Sugar Crystals and translucent sequins - dazzling!
