Former Spurs midfielder Rafael van der Vaart continued to enjoy his time off before the start of the new Bundesliga season, as he and girlfriend Sabia Boulahrouz were spotted strolling through the streets of St Tropez.

The pair, who have been dating since September 2013 after Rafael split with his ex-wife Sylvie, are holidaying in the south of France before he joins up with Hamburg for pre-season training.

Sabia is the former wife of Rafael's Holland team-mate Khalid Boulahrouz, who recently signed a one-year deal with Dutch side Feyenoord after leaving Brondby.

What's mine is yours: Sabia offers Rafael some of her ice cream as they walk through St Tropez

Rafael and
 Sabia were pictured sharing an ice-cream as they walked hand-in-hand, days after they were spotted basking in the sunshine on a boat just off the coast.

Van
 der Vaart was expected to be named in Louis van Gaal's 23-man squad for
 the World Cup until he was forced into pulling out of Holland's 
preliminary squad due to a calf injury.

The
 experienced midfielder will be hoping he can add to his 109 caps when 
he returns to the Dutch set-up under Guus Huddink after sitting out Van 
Gaal's final few matches in charge of the national team.

was on in Brazil, in an attempt to get back to full fitness ahead of the
 new domestic season.

Hamburg
 narrowly avoided relegation from the Bundesliga by winning their 
play-off match against Greuther Fuerth on away goals in May.
