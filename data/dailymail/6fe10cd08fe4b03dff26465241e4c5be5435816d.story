2015 marked a shift towards elegance for those attending the Oscars. 

The actresses walking the red carpet yesterday mainly kept their look sleek and glamorous, but there were some key trends that came from the evening. 

Nude dresses, quiffed hairdos and masculine tailoring were a big hit with some of the biggest stars in attendance.

Elsewhere, intricate embellishments, sheer gowns and black lace were also big-hitters among the fashion conscious. 

Among the more quirky celebrities, Scandinavian embroidery was also a key detail, offset by plain black dresses, while clever slimming tricks like waist-cinching gowns and illusion panels were also in abundance. 

Away from fashion, a big feature among the stars nominated for awards  was family plus ones, with many bringing a sister, father or daughter along for moral support.

NUDES AND BLUSH-COLOURED GOWNS 

Nudes was obviously seen as a very forgiving colour by stars aged 40 and above. 

The soft tones gave a guaranteed glow to every complexion from Jennifer Aniston to Anna Wintour.

WAIST-SLIMMING ILLUSION PANELS AND BELTS

It is hard to spot a single celebrity show is in need assistance from waist-slimming tricks on last night's Oscars red carpet. 

But despite their tiny frames, many actresses still used belted gowns and illusion panels, including Nicole Kidman and Rosamund Pike.

FAMILY PLUS ONES

Walking the red carpet can be a daunting affair, so who better to have on hand than a father, sibling or daughter to join you. 

Among others, Idris Elba and Patricia Arquette both called on family members for some moral support last night.

SCANDINAVIAN STITCHING

Stylised flowers in bright colours on a black background made sure that stars stood out from the rest of the peacocks on the red carpet.

STATEMENT LIPS

If you can't wear a bold lip to the Oscars, then where can you? 

The following stars made sure their faces shone by opting for bright reds and plum tones on their mouths.

Chrissy Teigen looked gorgeous with a dark plum shade of lipstick that offset her pale grey Zuhair Murad Couture gown 

Naomi Watts also chose to match her grey gown to a dark plum colour on her lips 

 

SHEER/ BLACK LACE

Sheer black and lace gowns were one of the key trends of the evening - if it's being worn on Sienna Miller then it must be right, after all. 

Stars opted for tasteful dark dresses with chic accessories.

MASCULINE TAILORING  

After several hours spent in an uncomfortable and movement-restricting long gown, you can't blame some actresses for wanting to switch to tailoring for the after parties. 

Stars like Naomi Watts pulled off the look with aplomb.

BLACK AND WHITE 

You can't go wrong with a simple black and white gown, as is evidenced by the three ladies below. 

Each of the stars accesorised their looks with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of detailing.

EMBELLISHMENT 

Old school Hollywood glamour has always relied on scores of rhinestones, diamonds and pearls to add that extra va va voom and last night was no different. 

Intricate beading was seen on both the Oscars red carpet and at the after parties.

QUIFFS
