From Mars Bars and Creme Eggs to Eccles cakes and even butter - it seems there isn't a food that avant garde chefs haven't tried to coat in batter and deep fry to create a less-than-healthy snack.

But fast food chain KFC has taken gastronomical experimentation to the next level - by deep frying soup.

The chicken chain is set to introduce its unusual version of a popular soup dish to its menu in Japan.

Experimental: KFC Japan is releasing a deep-fried version of corn potage, a type of popular soup

The company is looking to cash in on the nation's latest culinary obsession - a creamy soup known as corn potage.

But instead of serving it in bowls with a spoon, the chain will somehow cover it in its usual secret recipe batter and fry it.

The snack will go on sale on Thursday and will be available for a limited time only, say KFC Japan bosses.

A KFC source told Rocketnews24: 'We bread the corn potage and cook it to a crisp.'

Though the batter turns solid, the inside of the fritter stays soft and creamy.

Corn potage is a little thicker than normal soup which is how chefs were able to fry it in the first place without creating a gunky mess.

New snack: KFC will be selling the fritter for a limited period after it goes on sale in Japan from Thursday

The dish has become a common fixture in Japanese cafes and it has proved so popular that a popsicle company has expanded its line-up to include a corn potage flavour.

The product went on to become such a hit with consumers that stores couldn't keep up with demand.

Corn potage is not the first unusual food stuff to be deep fried.

In 2010, a takeaway in Eccles, Greater Manchester, created an 800 calorie snack by battering the town's most famous export - the Eccles cake.

A British couple's restaurant specialising in deep frying a range of already high calorie American foods also took New york by storm in the same year.

It seems that nothing was safe from the deep fat fryer in Chris Sell and Suzanne Hackett's restaurant - deep fried hamburger, pretzels and even cheesecake were on the menu.
