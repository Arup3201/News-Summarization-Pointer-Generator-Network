A Florida man who was wanted by cops is now behind bars after he inadvertently asked for a ride from an undercover officer who gladly gave him a lift to jail.

Half an hour earlier, Kareem Moore, 24, was on the run having robbed a home and stealing an Audi SUV, before dumping it on the side of the busy Interstate 95.

Broward Sheriff's deputies from Deerfield Beach picked up Moore just after he had run across several lanes of the busy freeway and jumped over a fence.
