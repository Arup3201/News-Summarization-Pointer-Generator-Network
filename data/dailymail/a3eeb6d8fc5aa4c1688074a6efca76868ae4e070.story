Blackpool are in talks to sign Austria defender Thomas Piermayr.

The 25-year-old has been training with the Championship club this week and they are keen to get him on board for what is expected to be confirmed as a campaign in League One next season.

Piermayr is a free agent and had been playing for Colorado Rapids. The former Austria U21 international had a spell with Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2011.
