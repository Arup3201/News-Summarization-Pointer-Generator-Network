A 31-year-old middle school guidance counselor in Massachusetts has been charged with having sex with a 14-year-old student and held on $30,000 bail.

Brian McBride of Attleboro pleaded not guilty yesterday to charges including statutory rape during an arraignment at which the girl's father was removed from the courtroom after an outburst.

Prosecutors allege McBride, who is married and has a toddler, had sex with the girl at school, in his car and at his home over several months last year.

McBride allegedly told police his marriage was in trouble and he loved the girl.Â  There is also a second alleged victim, which led to rape charges.

He was the 14-year-old girl's chorus teacher and gave her private singing lessons before becoming a guidance counselor at North Attleborough Middle School.

Prosecutors said in court that the girl's parents reported text messages between the pair to police, WPRI.com News reported.

Messages allegedly described the pair 'needing to find alone time' and he had told the student she was 'cute and sexy'.

The girl's parents went to police last weekend and he has since been fired.

McBride's lawyer said his client was 'well respected in the community up until these allegations.'

North Attleboro School District put out a statement saying: 'Our hearts go out to the families involved and ask that everyone please respect their privacy.

'We are putting supports in place for students, faculty, and our families.

'Our primary responsibility is to assist students to resume their educational focus and facilitate the healing process.'

McBride's wife, mother, stepfather and some of his friends attended the court hearing on Tuesday.
