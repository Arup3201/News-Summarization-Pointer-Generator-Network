They were the club who openly neglected the cup competitions with a manager embarrassed by his record.

Now, however, Newcastle United and Alan Pardew are two ties from Wembley and are going all out for their first domestic trophy in 60 years.

It was during a fans’ forum meeting last season that club hierarchy upset supporters when they admitted that the FA Cup and League Cup were not a priority.

Indeed, before this campaign Pardew had never made it beyond the fourth round of either competition, a failure he conceded was ‘embarrassing’. 

On Wednesday night, they face Spurs at White Hart Lane in the Capital One Cup quarter-final with debate on Tyneside raging over which match – this or Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby – takes precedence.

That the majority of supporters have sided with the chance of a first Wembley appearance since 2000 and first piece of domestic silverware since the FA Cup in 1955 and their first trophy since the 1969 Inter-City Fairs Cup, serves to highlight the significance of the trip to north London.

And that is not lost on Pardew.

‘It's about grasping this opportunity,’ said the former Crystal Palace midfielder, who was an FA Cup finalist in 1990.

‘I have played in quarter-finals before and there is just extra meaning to it. You just sense it. You are close. You are eight teams away.

‘It's like going to the funfair, I guess. When you are young, you are really looking forward to it because it's going to be exciting and that's the sense you get – and there's where we are.

‘I can feel the squad bubbling under in terms of the excitement and looking forward to the two games.’

He added: ‘Look, the derby is a Premier League game and an important one. We are all aware of that. It carries more significance in this area, and maybe in the football world because of the fixture's history.

‘But a quarter-final of the League Cup doesn't come around too often for this club and there is a spring in the step.’

Pardew’s record in the FA Cup, in particular, has been a source of shame. Newcastle have lost to Stevenage, Brighton (twice) and Cardiff during his four-year tenure.

Progression tonight, however, could represent payback to supporters who were so disgusted when a weakened team were beaten by Cardiff in January.

To that end, Pardew will be naming his strongest XI.

‘This run has eased the embarrassment a little bit,’ he said.

‘I don't think it will take away the pain of Brighton and Stevenage, and the Cardiff game which we should have won. That was such a disappointment and we carried that for a little while in our mood and personality.

‘I just hope that whatever happens that we put a performance on for our 4,000 fans. There are not many clubs who would go to Arsenal (on Saturday), come all the way back up, have a rest and then go back down to London again.

‘I appreciate that and their support is important.’

He went on: ‘We will be very strong (in terms of selection).

‘It's an exciting few days for us, and this is what we are in football for. We have got ourselves here. We have now got this moment, so let's grasp it. Hopefully this team can.

‘I think this team may be more geared up for football than past ones, so that helps, but we have also played very well and the cup competition has been key to the turn-around in our season.

‘If we win this, we have got all the momentum we need going into the derby. It can work in our favour.’
