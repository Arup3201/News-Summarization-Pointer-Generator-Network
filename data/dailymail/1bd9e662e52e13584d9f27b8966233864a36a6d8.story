Cleared: Former UFC fighter Jason 'Mayhem' Miller

A former UFC fighter and MTV reality show host has been cleared of vandalism after being discovered naked in a Californian church.

Jason 'Mayhem' Miller was found in Mission Hills Church in Mission Viejo by the pastor who called police when he found evidence of a break-in.

Orange County prosecutors said Miller, 31, was
accused of breaking at least one picture frame, spray-painting inside 
the church and damaging a propane tank and other items.

Court records show that Miller had the charge of a misdemeanor vandalism charge dismissed at a hearing yesterday.

When the incident happened three months ago Sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said deputies arrived and found Miller naked on a couch.

'When they asked him his name he responded Mayhem,' Mr Amormino told the Orange County Register.

They also found evidence that Miller had set off fire extinguishers inside the church, Mr Amormino said

Miller, a popular professional middleweight in the mixed martial arts 
world, has fought for several organizations including UFC, but has lost 
three of eight fights.

He also hosted the MTV show Bully Beatdown a reality show where bullies 
are challenged to take on professional MMA fighters for a chance to win 
money.

Last month walked out on The MMA Hour after bizarre behavior on set less than 20 minutes into the show.

The planned one-hour segment was Miller's first interview in months, but it turned into something entirely different than anyone expected.

Miller showed up as his character Lucky Patrick from the upcoming movie Here Comes the Boom, but and stayed in character during the interview.

He was belligerent to host Ariel Helwani, and refused several attempts to change the subject before finally leaving.
