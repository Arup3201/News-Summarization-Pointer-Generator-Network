A law student accused of targeting Tony Blair as part of a Mumbai-style terror plot also wanted to join forces with the sons of radical cleric Abu Hamza to commit an armed robbery, a court heard.

Erol Incedal, 26, is on trial charged with planning an act of terrorism, either on individuals or a wide-ranging Mumbai-style attack. He is also charged with possessing a bomb-making manual on a memory card.

Mr Justice Nicol told jurors at the Old Bailey that sketches and notes found at his family home related to plans for an armed robbery and used code words such as 'tennis rackets' for guns.

'He was friends with three sons of the radical cleric Abu Hamza - Hamza, Sufyan and Yaasir - who used to carry out frauds and armed robberies on post offices,' said Mr Justice Nicol.

'The defendant sketched out some ideas for armed an robbery he would propose to the Hamza brothers.'

The sketches had a number of coded words including a hand-written diagram around the word Jamal which was also to do with the robbery plan, according to the defendant, the court heard.  

Incedal attributed some notes interspersed with course work to his idea to set up a butcher's shop in London like a successful store his uncle had in Spain. But his uncle refused to help fund the plans.

The judge told the jury: 'The defendant told you he wrote these notes during the course of his lectures and seminars and that's why they appear in his course notes. They were written in the latter part of 2011.

Mr Justice Nicol told the court that Incedal wanted to join forces with Abu Hamza's sons. He also reminded the jury of the 26-year-old's troubled childhood 

'He did not share the ideas with the Hamza brothers or anyone else. He did not commit a robbery or make a positive decision to do so. He last saw these notes in the early part of 2012. The prosecution do not accept his explanation for these notes.'

As well as the proposed heist, the Turkish-born defendant also had money woes and had been caught cheating with the wife of a violent brother-in-law, the court heard.

At the time, the South Bank university law and accountancy student had trouble providing for his wife, whom he married at the age of 17, and their two children, the judge said.

Incedal previously told the jury that had affairs with a number of women, despite his marriage to Kadeejah Baluch who he shared a home with in Unity Court, south east London.

The judge said: 'He had affairs with a number of women. One was the wife of his brother-in-law. Her husband discovered what was going on and he was very angry. He (Incedal) was frightened of what his brother-in-law might do.

'He had a violent reputation and allegedly killed one man already. He was in prison in Oman awaiting trial for credit card fraud.'

The defendant was also asked about his political beliefs. Incedal believed resistance to foreign intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan was 'justified' and supported rebels against the Assad regime in Syria.

However, Incedal said he believed terrorism in the UK was 'illegal, immoral and contrary to Islam' and could lead to Muslims being harmed, the court heard. 

The judge, who was summing up Incedal's evidence, also reminded the jury of his troubled childhood. He was born in 1988 in Turkey where his father had been a member of the Turkish communist party and died when he was very young.

His sister was a member of the PKK and was killed in fighting too, the court heard.

His mother, who was from the Syria/Iraq region, brought Incedal and his siblings to the UK when he was just one year old.

His brother had been detained in a mental hospital and Incedal was excluded from primary school and almost excluded from secondary school, the judge said.

At the age of 12 he was convicted of attempted theft but a year later he became interested in Islam and joined the Tableeghi Jamaat religious movement, travelling with them to Greece, New York and Bangladesh.

The trial, which is being partly heard behind closed doors, continued in a private session.
