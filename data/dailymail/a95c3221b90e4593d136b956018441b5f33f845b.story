The aggressive Republican chairman of a House investigative committee demanded Monday that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen explain – in person – how 28 months of emails to and from embattled former official Lois Lerner were 'lost' to a computer crash.

California Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, wrote to Koskinen in reaction to his agency's claim Friday that the IRS no longer has copies of emails between Lerner and anyone outside the IRS from January 2009 through April 2011.

Lerner is at the center of a scandal involving years of intrusive screening of conservative groups that sought tax-exempt status beginning in 2009. Hundreds of them saw their applications delayed or denied while politically liberal organizations skated by and quickly received approval.

Issa demanded in his letter on Monday that Koskinen appear in a rare evening hearing on June 23, a half-day before he's scheduled to testify before the House Ways and Means Committee.

'I will not tolerate your continued obstruction and game-playing in response to the Committee’s investigation of the IRS targeting,' he wrote.

Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen will be hauled before two House committee hearings next week to explain how Lois Lerner's emails could have been lost despite robust data-retention standards in the U.S. government

Cruella de Washington: Lois Lerner retired with a full government pension and has refused to testify about her role in a years-long scheme to target tea party groups with politically imbalanced scrutiny

'For too long, the IRS has promised to produce requested – and, later, subpoenaed – documents, only to respond later with excuses and inaction.'

Lerner officially retired, with a full pension, in late 2013. House Republicans passed a Contempt of Congress resolution against her along party lines this year, after she twice refused to testify in open committee hearings.

Legal analysts disagreed about whether she had waived her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination by giving a lengthy statement during one hearing, in which she claimed she 'broke no laws' and 'did nothing wrong.'

It was Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican congressman, who whipped up a dust storm after the IRS first claimed the records were 'lost.'

The IRS informed the committee on Friday that many records were not backed up on servers, tapes or external drives. Its own guidelines require that 'IRS officies will not store the official recordkeeping copy of e-mail messages that are federal records ONLY on the electronic mail system.'

It also requires its offices to back up email messages to 'a separate electronic recordkeeping system.'

Camp and Rep. Charles Boustany, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, said Monday that 'we are simply not going to accept the IRS claim that these documents are not recoverable. We will demand the president live up to his promise to work "hand in hand" with Congress to get the facts.'

The two lawmakers wrote to President Obama on Monday, asking for its records of emails between Lerner and employees the White House, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Election Commission and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration.

That move came hours after committee staff interviewed government employees charged with running the IRS's internal computer networks.

A committee aide told MailOnline that those IRS workers confirmed that budget and space limitations forced the agency to limit officials' access to networks that would ordinarily store email archives.

They also said, according to the aide, that other executive branch agencies have their own independent archives of the records now lost at the IRS.

Camp and Boustany asked Obama to order 'an exhaustive search for all Lois Lerner emails' throughout the executive branch.

Republicans hope to establish whether or not Lerner colluded with Obama administration officials to play political favorites and single out right-wing groups for special scrutiny.

But the White House is likely under no obligation to cooperate. President Obama has already referred to the IRS matter as one of several 'phony scandals' that he believes are politically motivated.

Yet in May 2013 when the scandal first erupted, Obama pledged that his administration would 'make sure that we are working hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.'

Subpoena: Rep. Darrell Issa is demanding Koskinen show up for an evening interrogation on June 23

The Ways and Means Republicans threw that phrase back in the president's face on Monday.

'In order to ensure accountability and “get this thing fixed,” please provide ... all communications between Lois Lerner and any persons within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) for the period between January 1, 2009 and May 1, 2011,' they wrote.

'Also, please indicate in writing when the EOP [Executive Office of the President] was informed, and by whom, that the IRS had lost critical Lerner documents.'

In the House Oversight Committee, Issa hammered Koskinen for promising in a March 26 hearing that he would deliver every email Congress sought.

At the time, however, he insisted that it would take 'years' for lawyers to sift through them all and excise private taxpayer information that the IRS isn't permitted to share – not even with other arms of government.

And simply searching through Lerner's individual email storage, Koskinen said then, wouldn't produce an exhaustive record.

'They’re stored somewhere,' he explained to Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz during the hearing.

'They get taken off and stored in servers and you’ve got 90-thousand employees,' he insisted, but 'we can find, and we are in fact searching – we can find Lois Lerner’s emails.'

At the time, he didn't mention the computer crash which became an overnight butt of jokes among conservatives.

'It's OK. The NSA has the original files,' Capitol HIll speechwriter Amanda Carpenter tweeted.

'Wonder what the #IRS would say if we told them we couldn’t submit tax documents because of a computer crash?' replied her boss, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.

'Wheel of Fortune' game show host Pat Sajak, who has begun wearing his conservatism on his sleeve in recent years, tweeted: 'Weird. Hundreds of emails to & from someone named Lerner just showed up in my spam. Must be British. Lots of tea talk.'

Next week will see brutal hearings before two House committees investigating how the IRS targeted tea party groups with special scrutiny

@highlight

One chairman subpoenaed IRS Commissioner John Koskinen on Monday

@highlight

Koskinen testified in March that former official Lois Lerner's emails were accessible but would take 'years' in some cases to gather

@highlight

On Friday he told another House committee that more than two years' worth of her emails to and from people outside the IRS were lost when her computer crashed

@highlight

But Koskinen has already testified that messages are stored 'on a server' and not on individual employees' PCs

@highlight

Republicans hope to find out if Lerner colluded with the White House, the DOJ, the Treasury Department or other agencies to play political favorites with the tax code

@highlight

They are demanding that those departments search their own backups to see who Lerner was communicating with
