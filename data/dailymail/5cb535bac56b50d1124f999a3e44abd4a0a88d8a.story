Two men will appear in court tomorrow charged with the murder of a young mother - 23 years after she was last seen alive.

Nicola Payne vanished after leaving her seven-month-old baby with her boyfriend at his home to fetch baby clothes and food from her parents' home a five minute walk away.

Despite repeated searches no trace of the 18-year-old was ever found following her disappearance in Coventry, West Midlands, in December 1991.

Disappearance: Nicola Payne  vanished after leaving her seven-month-old baby Owen with her boyfriend at his home to fetch baby clothes and food from her parents' home a five minute walk away

Investigation: Last year West Midlands Police carried out searches of woodland in the Binley area of Coventry

Police today charged two men in their 50s with the teenage mother’s abduction and murder - 13 months after they were first arrested over Miss Payne’s disappearance.

Nigel Barwell, 51, of Aldermans Green, and Thomas O’Reilly, 50, of Stoke, both in Coventry, will appear at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court tomorrow morning.

Both were charged after reporting to a police station to answer bail. A 52-year-old woman originally arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice has been released without charge.

It is the first time anyone has ever been charged with any offence in connection with Nicola’s disappearance in Coventry’s Wood End district.

Probe: The searches followed new information received by officers investigating Miss Payne’s disappearance

The teenager split her time between boyfriend Jason Cooke’s home and that of her parents, Marilyn and John nearby.

Her son, Owen, now 23, was raised by his father, who is now 43, but regularly stayed with his maternal grandparents.

Last March, West Midlands Police carried out a three-day search of woodland in the grounds of Coombe Abbey Country Park on the outskirts of Coventry.

The searches followed new information received by officers investigating Miss Payne’s disappearance. Her body has never been found.

Parents: Marilyn and John Payne, of Walsgrave, Coventry, whose daughter Nicola went missing 23 years ago

Detective Inspector Martin Slevin, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘Today’s charges follow months of extensive enquiries by a team of dedicated officers who are investigating the disappearance of Nicola.

‘But I want to reassure Nicola’s family and the local community that the search for Nicola will continue. Over the past year a number of sites have been searched and these investigations will carry on.

‘I would like to thank the local community for their support and those people who have come forward to provide information about Nicola’s disappearance.’

Mr Slevin also appealed for anyone with information about the case who is ‘yet to come forward’ to get in touch with the force or Crimestoppers.
