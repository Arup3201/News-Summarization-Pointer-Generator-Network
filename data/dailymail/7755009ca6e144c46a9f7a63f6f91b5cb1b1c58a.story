During the war, Charles Green protected Britain from the  menace of Nazi U-boats and  the threat of German invasion.

At 16, he lied about his age to join the Royal Marines, serving mainly on the Shetland Islands and around the Scapa Flow naval base in the Orkney Islands, where he defended the country’s ships and shores.

But it was the toughness he needed as a Marine that finally cost him his life at the hands of two callous thugs – and then led to him helping to secure their convictions from beyond the grave.

Brave: Minutes after the raid on May 2 last year, Mr Green dialled 999 and refused an ambulance but police arrived and an officer took his statement on a helmet-mounted camera

Mr Green, 87, was fatally injured when he defiantly refused to give his bank details to two men who broke into his house in May last year.

Despite suffering bleeding to the brain and a broken hip – injuries which would contribute to him dying a month later – he managed to give police a full account of the attack. The interview was filmed using a camera mounted in one of the officers’ helmets.

This week footage from that interview helped send his killers to jail. It was the first time that an interview with a victim who later died, filmed with a helmet-mounted camera, has been played to a jury to help secure a conviction.

Thugs: Tragic Charles Green suffered bleeding on

bank card to intruders Danny Keeble (left), 26, and Peter Marston

Mr Green, who had heart disease, was attacked by Danny Keeble, 26, and Peter Marston, 24, when they burgled his home in Oswestry, Shropshire, in May last year.

The thugs forced him into a headlock and threatened to beat him if he didn’t hand over his bank card and PIN. The great-grandfather, who was divorced and had lived alone for ten years, refused.

He then suffered serious injuries when Keeble knocked him to the floor and sat on top of him while Marston ransacked his bungalow.

The pair couldn’t find any valuables, so fled taking only a passport, savings book and other papers.

After the burglary, Mr Green, a retired accountant, managed to dial 999 and officers interviewed him using the head-cam. He was taken to hospital but died of a heart attack four weeks later.

Beyond the grave: Mr Green told officers that one person held him down while another searched the bungalow - proving both men entered the property

Mr Green told police: 'They hit me and put a lock on me, a wrestling lock, they were sitting on top of me'

Last testament: Mr Green was taken to hospital after officers called an ambulance but he died of a heart attack four weeks later

At Stafford Crown Court on Thursday, Keeble, of no fixed address, and Marston, from Stafford, were each jailed for 15 years after being found guilty of manslaughter.

Speaking with a bandage wrapped around his bleeding head, Mr Green described when the attack took place and how one person held him down while another searched the bungalow proving both men entered the property.

Although disorientated, he managed to provide the police with crucial information. A recording of the 999 call made by Mr Green was also played to the jury.

Handsome hero: Mr Green served as a Royal Marine in World War Two when he was just 16, left.

After the case, crown prosecutor Stephen Bacon said the video evidence was critical because Mr Green was too unwell to give police a full statement in the weeks before he died. Head-cams have been worn by police since 2007.

‘A key part of the evidence was a voice from beyond the grave,’ he said. ‘The head-cam clarified the key points of what happened and the force used on him.’

Yesterday, Mr Green’s eldest son Terry, 61, paid tribute to his ‘courageous’ father. ‘He didn’t talk about the war much but I know he was a Marine and he saw action,’ he said.
