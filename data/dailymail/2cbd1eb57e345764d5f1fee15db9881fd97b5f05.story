Three Kansas high school football players are accused of branding the stomachs of several freshman players with a hot coat hanger in a disturbing hazing incident.

Kendric Hudson, 18, has been charged with three counts of aggravated battery and misdemeanor hazing; Jaiden Casanova, 18, with aggravated battery and hazing; and 16-year-old Cody Curl with aggravated battery in the November 1 incident.

The students twisted the hanger back and forth until it got hot enough to leave random burn marks on the skin of four 14-and 15-year-olds in the Hutchinson High School locker room, prosecutors said.

The young players had just been moved up to the varsity squad.

'I think of branding as using a hot iron heated in coals or a fire,' Reno County District Attorney Keith Schroeder said on Wednesday, adding that the students were not marked with a consistent symbol.

'But I guess if you burn someone with something it is branding. It's a matter of semantics. Whether it leaves a permanent mark or not is unclear.'

Hudson and Casanova are both free on bond but Curl is being held in the Reno County Juvenile Detention Center.

Reno County Chief Judge Patricia Macke Dick said on Tuesday that Curl's criminal history in the past year gave her sufficient reason to rule he stay in detention.

According to The Hutchinson News, Curl is currently on probation for aggravated battery charges from May and September 2012 and has 16 pending burglary, theft and criminal-use-of-a-financial-card charges filed October 21.

The issue of hazing and bullying has 
been in the news recently in connection with several high-profile 
incidents, including the suspension of Miami Dolphins player Richie 
Incognito for his alleged harassment of teammate Jonathan Martin.

Court records did not listed attorneys for Hudson and Casanova.

The Hutchinson School District said in a statement it does not tolerate hazing and players were warned twice by football coach Randy Dreiling that hazing in any form was forbidden.

Dreiling went to police about the hanger incident and the district said it is cooperating with police.

District spokesman Ray Hemman told The Hutchison News it was 
standard practice for a teacher or coach to be in the locker room when 
students are present but couldn't confirm whether one was there when the
alleged branding occurred.

He declined to discuss possible punishments for the players, though Reno County Assistant District Attorney Cheryl Allen suggested Curl was suspended for 10 days.

Curl's attorney, Greg Bell, opposed 
Macke Dick's decision to keep his client in detention, insisting his client was a good student who was about to start work on a construction site and was capable of 
self-discipline, something Curl learned as a high school wrestler.

But Allen disagreed.

'I
don't see a lot of self-discipline going on because if there were, he 
would not have picked up new charges on this,' she told the judge.
