To his elderly mother, Heinrich Himmler was a good boy. He kept in touch, remembered birthdays – and always made sure to drop her a line whenever he invaded a nice country.

As nations across Europe toppled to Germany during the Second World War, Himmler’s mother Anna amassed a collection of cheerful postcards from the monster responsible for the murder of millions.

One was posted from Paris only three days after the Nazis took control of the French capital in June 1940.

Romantic: But this postcard of the Seine was sent by Himmler just after the Nazis had conquered France

Gestapo head: Heinrich Himmler affectionately addressed his postcards to 'Mutti' (the German term for Mummy)

Affectionately addressed to ‘Mutti’ 
(the German term for Mummy), it shows a picture of the Alexander III 
bridge over the Seine while the reverse reads ‘the pretty corners of 
Paris’.

‘My dearest Mummy!’ wrote the head of
the Gestapo and the SS.

‘Today I am sending you very warm greetings 
from Paris. I hope you are well. Your Heinrich.’

Underneath is a message written by 
Karl Wolff, Himmler’s chief of personal staff, which adds: ‘With good 
wishes for your wellbeing. Heil Hitler.’

There is also a postcard from 
Dombas,  Norway, which Himmler sent to his mother in November 1941.

He told her how he had visited Oslo and was about to travel to Trondheim, where anti-Semitic riots later broke out.

An earlier card displaying a picture 
of Mussolini was sent from Rome where Himmler had attended the 1932 
Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution.

His boss also passed on his regards 
to Mrs Himmler, signing one of  the cards and sending his own telegram 
in January 1941 to wish her a happy birthday.

It read: ‘Would you please receive my best wishes on your 75th birthday. Adolf Hitler.’

'Very warm greetings from Paris': Himmler kept his elderly mother updated on the Nazis' rampage around Europe

Norway: Himmler wrote to his mother on the way to Trondheim, later the scene of anti-Semitic riots

Macabre: The cards include one from conquered Norway in 1941 (left), and a souvenir from Mussolini's 'Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution' in Rome (right)

The postcards are part of an archive 
of documents, photographs, signed books and paintings seized by an 
American serviceman from Himmler’s holiday home in southern Germany.

Lieutenant Richard J. Wills was asked
to remodel the house into a senior officers’ club after the war ended 
and took the items as souvenirs.

They include a communion certificate 
that Himmler, a Roman Catholic, received from the church as an 
11-year-old. His mother was a strict Catholic and brought her son up in 
the faith.

'Dearest parents': Himmler wrote to his mother and father about his 1932 visit to Fascist Italy

Führer: Hitler sent Anna Himmler a telegram congratulating her on her 75th birthday

His religion is thought to have been a key part of Himmler’s twisted motivation to wipe out the Jewish people.

The archive, being put up for sale by
Lieutenant Wills’s family, is expected to go for £40,000. Richard 
Westwood-Brookes, of Mullock’s auctioneers in Shropshire, said: ‘Himmler
kept in regular contact with his elderly mother during the war and 
judging by these postcards he was a bit of a mummy’s boy.’

Himmler committed suicide after being captured by the Allies in May 1945.

Propaganda: This Nazi postcard dates from 1927, before the movement gained power in Germany
