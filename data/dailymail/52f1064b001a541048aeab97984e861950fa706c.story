This is the man police believe carried out the hit of a British man found dead with his throat cut in a rice paddy in Bali earlier this week.

The body of Robert Kelvin Ellis, 60, was found wrapped in plastic and dumped in a ditch in the rice field near Sedang Village on Tuesday. 

Adrianus Ngongo, the main suspect in the murder, was questioned at Bali Police Headquarters in Denpasar on Thursday.

Police will allege Mr Ellis' Indonesian wife Julaikah Noor Aini, who goes by the name Noor Ellis, ordered the hit on him.

Mr Ellis' wife has allegedly confessed to ordering the murder because he cheated on her 'often'.

'The motive is because his wife felt embittered with the victim,' Badung police chief Komang Suartana told News Corp.

'Because of many things. She said that her husband is often cheating on her. We allege that she paid the executioners to kill her husband.' 

Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife

Mr Suartana said police had arrested one of the alleged killers Padangbai in Bali's east, and were searching for three others.

Officials confirmed that Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife.

He is understood to have two sons who are studying in Australia.

A friend told Fairfax Media that Mr Ellis spent a lot of his time in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, where he had an apartment.

'He used to go up there every week and was rooting every girl that runs around town,' the friend  told Fairfax. 

Mr Ellis' sons said they are 'completely devastated'.

Jon and Peter Ellis, both students of Perth's Edith Cowan University, say their businessman father was a huge influence in their lives.

The sons, due to arrive in Bali on Friday, released a statement paying tribute to their father.

'The circumstances surrounding the death of our father is something we are still trying to come to terms with at this moment,' they said.

'We are fortunately surrounded by friends and family.

'We do ask for people to understand our need for privacy at this extremely difficult and sad time for us.'

Although Mr Ellis's wife has reportedly confessed to ordering her husband's murder, he is said to have angered contractors who were building a motel for him in the Bali beach side town of Sanur, claiming they were not doing a good job.

He was accused by the friend of being very tight with money.

Bali police said Mr Ellis' was found with his hands and feet tied, and a bed cover had been put over his body.

'There is no doubt this was an execution-style murder,' said a senior police officer in the Bali capital, Denpasar.

Mr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, who heads the district's forensic team, said Mr Ellis' throat had been slashed three times. 

The body Mr Ellis, 60, was found in a rice field on Tuesday morning local time by residents

'One of the wounds to the throat was fatal, but he also had several bruises around his head, suggesting he had been knocked to the ground before receiving the fatal throat wound,' said Mr Putu.

A mobile phone and a large mat was found in close proximity to the body, local authorities said. 

Detective Wisnu Wardana said the body is believed to have been lying in the ditch for several days as it was in a state of decay.

The rice paddy where the body was found lies between the popular coastal area of Kuta and the hillside town of Ubud.

'There was a deep wound to the neck that had almost completely cut the head,' said Detective Wisnu. 

Police believe the mat found in the ditch was used to wrap the body and carry it to the rice paddy to be dumped.

It is understood Mr Ellis went missing in the early hours of last Sunday morning.

There were bruises around his mouth and his right cheek, as well as on both his upper arms, suggesting he had been restrained.

It is understood that Mr Ellis and his wife had been living in the Emerald Villas, a luxury complex in the Balinese seaside district of Sanur.

Although the villas are for rent by holidaymakers, local media said that Mr Ellis and his wife were believed to have purchased one of the villas.
