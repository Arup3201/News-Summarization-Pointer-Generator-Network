We all overindulged during the Christmas holidays.

And it seems the extra mince pies and brandy butter have left more of a stain on our bodies than on our carpets.

Almost 60 per cent of us gained weight over Christmas, and now more than ever we are turning to control-wear in order to hide our unwelcome lumps and bumps - even men.

Now you see it... now you don't: George at Asda's 'mansie' means men no longer have to miss out on all the fun of hiding your wobbly bits inside tummy-hugging lycra

George at Asda have reported a sales spike in their Bodysculpt line since the festive festivities died down, with even their £15 all-in-one 'mansie' - a Spanx-style figure-squeezing garment for men, that resembles an old fashioned male swimsuit - tripping off shelves.

Perfect for hiding 'moobs' and beer bellies, sales of the Bodysculpt all-in-one suit and the 
Bodysculpt top have risen 10 per cent since the first of January, as men 
sculpt their festive problem areas.

And it correlates with results of a survey that revealed men most admire the physiques of David Beckham, Bradley Cooper and Daniel Craig out of all male celebrities.

Total sales of men and women's control-wear at George are up 167% at George since 1 January.

George's Bodysculpt range is built with inch-pinching control panels that lift and sculpt, as well as shaping 
technology. And it is in general 350 per cent cheaper than competitor 
versions on the high street and stocks the most choice for men on the 
high street.

The Mansie: George at Asda's Bodysculpt all-in-one suit for men acts by squeezing, shaping and smoothing bodily lumps and bumps

With 43 per cent of women spending up to £100 on control lingerie a year, a George survey of 1,500 shoppers revealed that 49 per cent of women spent the majority of this money in the first week of January, to boost confidence and sculpt curves following holiday excess.

Research revealed that 59 per cent of shoppers felt they over-indulged during the festive season and gained four pounds or more - causing their confidence to plummet.

And 33 per cent of shoppers say that control garments are more essential after the festive season than at any other time of the year.

Moreover, as 64 per cent of shoppers reveal they plan to getting fit in the New Year, 73 per cent believe their stomach is the area of the body that needs taming most, closely followed by bottoms and thighs.

Line of best fit: Women prefer the George high-waisted, above, and control pants and seam-free control dress more than any other item

Controlwear sales are up 456 per cent year on year, with women preferring the George high-waisted control pants and seam-free control dress more than any other item,.

George Brand Director Fiona Lambert commented: 'After a season of partying, men and women still want to look great in the New Year.

'We know our customers, both male and female, are big fans of shape-wear so we ensure stocks are high in January to boost their confidence and help them cheat their way to a smoother silhouette in 2013.'
