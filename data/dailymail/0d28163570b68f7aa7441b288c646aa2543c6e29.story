A mother who was declared not guilty by reason of insanity after being charged with three counts of attempted murder for driving her three children into the ocean in a van may have been triggered by her most recent pregnancy.

Dr. Jeffrey Danziger testified in a Daytona Beach, Florida courtroom on Tuesday that 33-year-old Ebony Wilkerson's mental crisis last March was likely triggered by her pregnancy, but that her symptoms disappeared after she gave birth to her child while in jail.

Wilkerson's mental illness appears to be in remission, and there is nothing in her behavior to indicate that she is dangerous, Danziger said.

'She has done well in the past seven months,' the psychiatrist added.

But Dr. William Meadows, a psychologist, argued that Wilkerson needs to be forcibly confined for treatment so she can get a handle on her mental illness. 

She has shown an unwillingness to admit she has mental illness, Meadows said, and what happened last March was similar to a 2005 episode when Wilkerson was hearing voices to kill her family and herself.

'We don't have a handle on what's going on with her,' Meadows said. 

'She is unwilling to admit to these difficulties. She lacks insight into these difficulties. That lack of insight is a major risk factor.'

Circuit Judge Leah Case ruled last week that Wilkerson was not guilty by reason of insanity of child abuse, and prosecutors dropped attempted murder charges. 

The judge must now determine whether Wilkerson should be forcibly hospitalized, released under certain conditions or released with no conditions.

Wilkerson ultimately gave birth to her fourth child while she was in prison

Wilkerson, of South Carolina, drove her van into the surf off Daytona Beach, Florida on March 4.

One of the children fought with Wilkerson over the steering wheel as the car was entering the water and was able to lower the windows to call rescuers' attention.

Bystanders and officers pulled her and her children - aged three, nine and ten, from the van as it was pulled into the waves.

Wilkerson, who was pregnant at the time of her arrest, reportedly punched her belly after being taken into custody and had to undergo psychiatric treatment.

She gave birth to a boy after her arrest. The child is in the custody of her husband, Lutful Ronjon. 

Wilkerson's attorneys planned to continue making their case against confinement Wednesday morning. 

Their presentation was interrupted when one of Wilkerson's attorney, Juliane Morris, fainted at a podium while questioning Danziger. 

She quickly regained consciousness.
