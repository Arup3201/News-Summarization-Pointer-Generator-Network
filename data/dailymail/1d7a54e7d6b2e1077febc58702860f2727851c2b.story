We've had 'owling', 'planking', 'breading', 'coning' and 'lamping', but is it now time for us to put away childish things and start 'fridging'?

American rapper Nicki Minaj tried to kick-start the trend for getting inside your fridge after she was photographed crouched low in the salad crisper as part of a bizarre shoot for Glamour magazine.

The star took to Twitter, encouraging people to copy her and post photographic evidence online - but the cold weather has prevented us from getting excited about it. Until now.

Now that the sun has come out, people are more inclined to follow the craze Minaj attempted to start in October.

Fridgers including Olivia Wilkes and Richard O'Toole have taken to social networking sites to support Minaj's craze, posting photographs of themselves hugging or getting inside fridges to escape the heat.

A few brave people followed Minaj's lead last year during the winter, posting pictures of themselves - and in some cases their pets - inside refrigerators.

One group of friends even launched a Facebook group, The Art Of Fridging, and posted photos of them inside their fridge.
