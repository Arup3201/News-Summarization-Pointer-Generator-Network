Defense costs for convicted Boston mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger totaled more than $2.6 million through June, according to a court filing Friday.

The accounting includes fees for his court-appointed attorneys, J.W. Carney Jr., and Hank Brennan, and other expenses totaling about $17,000.

Bulger, 84, was convicted Aug. 12 of racketeering, including 11 killings, as well as extortion, money laundering and weapons charges, in the 1970s and '80s. He faces the possibility of life in prison when he is sentenced in November.

He became one of the nation's most-wanted fugitives when he fled Boston in 1994 ahead of an indictment.

Taxpayers can expect more bills for Bulger's defense: the expenses disclosed Friday begin with the end of June 2011, when Bulger was captured in Santa Monica, Calif., through the beginning of his trial. They don't include July and August when his trial was ongoing.

Bulger's attorneys were paid the standard rate of $125 an hour. Other costs included $139,000 for paralegal services, $62,000 for investigative services and $36,000 for transcripts.

Prosecutors have said the criminal operations Bulger controlled made millions, and more than $800,000 in cash was found hidden in his California apartment. He was granted public defenders when he said his assets had been seized by the government.
