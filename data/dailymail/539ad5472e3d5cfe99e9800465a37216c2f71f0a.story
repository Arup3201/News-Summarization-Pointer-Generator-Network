Lucky escape: Shaukei Oliveira, 47, shows the wounds he suffered after being pulled into a cement mixer while working on a building site in Canada

A construction worker who was almost crushed to death when he was pulled into a functioning cement mixer has made a surprising recovery after only two weeks.

When Shaukei Oliveira was dragged into the machinery on a building site he thought his life was over, as it crushed his bones and left his vital organs exposed.

The 47-year-old had been scraping excess mortar from the edge of the mixing barrel while building a house in South Windsor, Canada, when his tool got caught on the machine's mixing paddle.

His jumper became attached, quickly dragging him into the powerful barrel.

The incident left Mr Oliveira with a collapsed lung, broken ribs, severe cartilage and nerve damage, and his chest ripped open.

After entering the machine, the construction worker said 'I didn't think i was going to come out', but his colleagues quickly rushed to the scene, flipping the machine over and freeing him before he was crushed to death.

Recalling the incident, Mr Oliveira, from Windsor in Ontario, 
Canada, said: 'I was looking around thinking 'Please, somebody come 
here' - when I went in I didn't think I was going to come out.

'I couldn't keep up my breath to yell for help. It just caught me and I was trying to fight it.'

He added: 'But then I couldn't hold it any 
longer and it just started ripping me apart. I remember closing my eyes 
and saying 'please Lord, don't let me die like this.

Crushed:  The incident left Mr Oliveira with a collapsed lung, broken ribs, severe cartilage and nerve damage, and a huge gash across his chest 

'The next thing I remember is opening
his eyes again and seeing my boss and another co-worker running over 
and flipping the mixer over and pulling me out.'

He was rushed to the nearby Hotel Dieu Grace Hospital in Windsor after the incident on December 14 with a huge gash across his 
chest.

Doctors informed his family that his heart and a lung 
were visible.

Mr Oliveira was placed on a respirator in the hospital, marking the beginning of his rapid recovery.

He is currently being cared for by family members at his mother's house and said his family was 'ecstatic' about his safe return, adding: 'They didn’t expect me to come home so fast.'

Speaking of his good fortune, he added: 'Considering less than two 
weeks ago I was on a respirator fighting for my life, I am very 
fortunate and blessed to be at home, especially for the holidays.

'Somebody was saying a lot of prayers for me.'
