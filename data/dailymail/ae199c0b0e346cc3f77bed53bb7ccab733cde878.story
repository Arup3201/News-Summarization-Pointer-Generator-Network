A North Seattle woman says she is about to losing her home after ignoring a lawsuit brought against her by an angry neighbor, who is complaining about a barking dog.

Denise Norton says that her neighbor, Woodrow Thompson, sued her for 'profound emotional distress', claiming her dog, Cawper's 'raucously, wildly bellowing, howling and explosively barking' could reach 128 decibels.

That amount of decibels makes the dogs barking almost as loud as a jet engine.

However Norton never contested the lawsuit, and as a result the neighbor was awarded $500,000 by default, according to KOMO News.

Dispute: Denise Norton (left) said she ignored the lawsuit because it had been one of many complaints from her neighbor and she did not think he was serious

'In my head, everything was so bogus that he'd been doing, I don't know why, I just didn't think it was real or something,' Norton told the local ABC News.

'The sheriff comes, puts the papers on the garage and the wall and everything and saying they were going to put the house up for sale.'

Mike Fandel, a civil attorney with no ties to the case, said what happened is legitimate.

'You can bring a frivolous lawsuit and win if the other side doesn't show up,' he told KOMO.

Norton admits it is her fault but for not challenging the 36-page suit, but says Cawper is not the problem Thompson made him out to be - and it's definitely not a $500,000 issue.

Up in arms: Denise Norton is now trying to have the decision reversed, but it's not looking good

'How can you give somebody a half-a-million-dollar lien over a dog barking?' Norton said. 

'He's just a loving, nice dog.'

Norton is now fighting to have the decision reversed.

She said her savings have been drained by legal fees already and there is still a long way to go.

A main part of her case is a camera on Thompson's property that points into her yard.

Thompson was not available for comment  on the case.
