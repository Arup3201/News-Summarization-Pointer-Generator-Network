Police in New Zealand have been inundated with phone calls after the arrest of a hostel owner accused of sexually assaulting sixteen men.

Detective Senior Sergeant Rhys Johnston said police had also received about 20 emails overnight from around the world from potential victims and those with information, and that the number was continuing to grow.

Police made an official appeal on Wednesday to overseas tourists - possibly including Australians - who stayed at a backpackers’ lodge and suspect 'something happened to them there' to come forward with their stories.

The 56-year-old New Zealand man who ran the backpackers' lodge appeared in court on Wednesday facing dozens of indecent assault charges involving 16 young men who were said to have been drugged.

Police in New Zealand have been inundated with phone calls after the arrest of Michael Harris (above) who is accused of sexually assaulting sixteen men.

Harris, who appeared in the Kaitaia District Court on Wednesday, was charged with almost 40 offences, including aggravated wounding related to allegedly drugging his victims to facilitate indecent assault and making intimate visual recordings.

He was also charged of possession of intimate visual recordings and indecent assault and was remanded in custody to appear at the court again on September 18.

The New Zealand Herald reported police said many of the victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years. The men were mainly overseas tourists aged between 18 and 25.

The premises offers general backpacking facilities, hotel units and, on occasions, longer term accommodation in the owner’s residence.

Asking backpackers to come forward, police said they were continuing their investigations.

‘It is very important for us to speak to anybody who has stayed in the owner’s residence over the last two and a half years,’ said Detective Senior Sergeant Rhys Johnson.

‘These victims are unlikely to know that something has happened to them, although they may have suspicions,’ the Herald quoted him as saying.

Victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years 

Police allege the 54-year-old drugged the men from overseas countries - possibly including those from Australia

‘We will deal sensitively with them and offer all appropriate support required.

‘This is an ongoing investigation and we have a lot of work ahead to assess evidence and establish if there are further victims we are not yet aware of.’

To help potential victims contact the investigation team, police have set up an email address.

Backpackers who believe they might have been indecently assaulted are asked to contact this email address: operations@police.govt.nz
