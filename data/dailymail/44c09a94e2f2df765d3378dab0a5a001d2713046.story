Carly Flockhart, of Inverness, stole thousands from her own company to fund her gambling addiction

A mother with an online gambling addiction embezzled tens of thousands of pounds from her own company to try to pay off debts of more than £120,000.

Carly Flockhart’s habit began after the drowning of her partner, William Reid, the father of her son.

The tragedy prompted the mum to seek ‘solace in the excitement of online gambling’, according to a psychiatrist’s report.

But the 29-year-old’s habit saw her lose her home and now she faces jail if she fails to repay the £66,514 she took from her business partner.

Sheriff David Sutherland ordered psychiatric reports on Flockhart, from Inverness, after she admitted taking £66,000 from cleaning equipment firm WC Supplies while she was company secretary.

The theft took place over a two year period while she was in charge of sales from 2009.

She held a one-third partnership in the business.

Prosecutor Karen Smith told a previous hearing at Inverness Sheriff Court: ‘This was not an elaborate plan where false records were kept. She was paying money into her own account and raising false invoices to cover that amount.

‘It came to the attention of other members of the company in October 2010, when a county court judgment was awarded against the company by a supplier.

‘An invoice for £2,400 was not paid and their bank account was frozen. The invoice was subsequently paid.

‘The suspicions of one of the other shareholders were aroused about the finances of the company and he asked an accountant to investigate.

Flockhart will be sentenced at Inverness Sheriff Court later this month after she admitted stealing thousands

‘When confronted about the missing money, she broke down in tears and confessed.’

At the hearing yesterday, Marc Dickson, defending, said: ‘She worked very hard to develop the business, but unfortunately she was beset by a number of personal difficulties.

Carly Flockhart became addicted to gambling following the death of her partner who drowned

‘She suffered from post-natal depression and in 2007 her partner and father of her son drowned at sea. My client turned to gambling to negate her loss and the psychiatrist who compiled today’s report said she found solace in the excitement of online gambling.

‘Her debts to the gambling company exceeded £120,000. She is now subject to a bankruptcy hearing; the equity in her house which she no longer owns and other spare funds have been paid in to a trust to repay her creditors.’

Sheriff Sutherland said he wanted more details of Flockhart’s current financial position.

Deferring sentence to August 22, he said: ‘The priority here is to try and get the money repaid to a small company which has suffered a heavy loss.’

After the hearing, WC Supplies director Alan Walker claimed he went without pay for almost a year to keep the business afloat.

He said he felt ‘very betrayed’, adding: ‘It was all local businesses who were owed money and I nearly went bankrupt. But I was determined that they got paid.’
