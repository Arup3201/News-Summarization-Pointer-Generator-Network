Mr Bhati said he knew the goat was sacred when he found 'Allah' in Arabic, pictured, on the animal's coat

Mr Bhati said: ‘It’s a miracle animal and I feel blessed to own him. We have looked after this goat like our child and he’s the best goat around. We can easily charge 11 million for such a divine animal, it's pretty reasonable.’

Mr Bhati, who run's the family's marble business, bought the goat from a nearby farm two years' ago.

He said: ‘I noticed the inscriptions soon after I bought him. I knew it was sacred. Since we took him into our home we have cared for him and fed him pulses, fresh tree leaves and dry fruit. His meat will be very good.’

Mr Bhati has been offered huge sums for the goat since he posted an advert on the Internet last week. However, no one has stepped forward and paid the asking price yet.

Mr Bhati said: ‘The most I’ve been offered so far is 2.5 million rupees (£30,000) but I refused. If anything this goat is a priceless animal. I will only sell it for the asking price. And when I sell it, I’ll give 50 per cent of the money to a local orphanage. We’ll miss him when he’s gone but there cannot be a better occasion to sell him.’

Muslims sacrifice a goat or a sheep on the eve of Eid-al-Adha to commemorate Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail on God's command.

He said: ‘He is special. He’s one in a million. So far I’ve been offered 500,000 rupees but I refused. I’ll wait, I’m sure I’ll get what I’m asking for it by Saturday.’
