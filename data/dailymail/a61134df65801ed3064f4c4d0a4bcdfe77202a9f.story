Fishing is known to be a sedentary sport but four men in the Northern Territory have given it a dangerous twist.

Risking their lives, the fisherman decided to try and reel in sharks to the shore using a simple rope and a lump of fish as their bait.

The bizarre tug of war game that ensued, filmed at a bay in the Cobourg Peninsula, 350 km east of Darwin in the Northern Territory, has been posted on YouTube.

Four men went fishing for sharks on the Cobourg Peninsula, 350 km east of Darwin in the Northern Territory

Bull sharks are aggressive and are thought to be responsible for the majority of near-shore shark attacks but the men did not seem bothered.

They laughed and joked as they chucked the lump of fish attached to a rope into the water.

‘I’ve got a nibble... here we go,’ shouts one of the men as the rope starts to thrash around.

‘You still got it,' he says reassuring the man holding the rope.

The fisherman attached a lump of fish to a thin rope and flung it in the water just metres from where they stood

As a shark took hold of the bait a man cried 'I've got a nibble' and held on tightly

A wrestle ensued as the shark thrashed around in the water and the men tried to pull it to shore

But the rope came away clean with no sign of the fish or the shark 

During their numerous attempts in the full-length video the rope comes away clean with no sign of a shark or the fish.

'You've just got to keep walking backwards while it’s shaking its head,’ another man says, implying he’s a bit if an expert.

They continue their mission laughing as one man gets dragged into the water and another runs in to back him up.

Meanwhile, their friend tries to sneak up to a shark in the shallow water and grab it with his bare hands.

Fortunately on this trip the biggest injury they suffered was just a case of bad rope burn.
