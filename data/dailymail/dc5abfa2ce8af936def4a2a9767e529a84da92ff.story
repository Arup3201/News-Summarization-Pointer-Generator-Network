Property tycoon Christian Candy has upset his soon-to-be neighbours by buying a stretch of road next to his £200million mansion to make room for a private garden.

Mr Candy, who already has planning permission to convert a row of offices into a 15-bedroom home on an exclusive street in central London, caused a stir after purchasing a lease on a 200ft section of road and pavement from the Crown Estate for £3million.

Furious residents say the latest plans, which will see a garden built next to the house on Cambridge Terrance and Chester Gate, next to Regent's Park, will cause more than two years of disruption. 

The Chester Terrace Residents' Association - representing 40 homes on the Grade 1 listed row of family homes - says the work will disrupt traffic and endanger pedestrians.

A spokeswoman told the Evening Standard: 'We had a meeting with Crown Estate and they said there would be hoardings in the road for more than two years while the work was ongoing.

'Then we were told about the garden proposals and it would only be for private use by Christian Candy. All the other gardens around here are for communal use and this would be the largest private garden near here.'

Mr Candy's neighbours will be consulted before any decisions on the plans are made by Camden Council and the Crown Estate Paving Commission.

The tycoon, 39, bought the block of large homes - London's second largest private residence after Buckingham Palace - last year.

The home will have 35 bathrooms alone, as well as a private rooftop garden with a sliding glass roof.

The seven Regency houses, including numbers one and two Chester Gate and numbers six to 10 Cambridge Terrace, were designed by John Nash - the architect of Buckingham Palace.

They were constructed in 1826 but were damaged by bombs in WWII and a subsequent fire in 1947, before being restored with replica Nash facades in the 1980s.

A spokesman for Mr Candy's company CPC said the stretch of road was originally a private garden.

He said: 'The garden was subsequently removed to make way for an extra lane of traffic and for a period was two way. The road is now reverted to a one-way street. 

'It seems proper and fitting to replace the second lane of tarmac and to reinstate the garden. This would, with the other private gardens which feature throughout the Nash Terraces, restore Nash's original design.'
