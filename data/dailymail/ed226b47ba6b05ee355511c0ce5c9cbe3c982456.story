A Holocaust survivor is hoping to be reunited with his long-lost twin after spending his life without the brother he lost when they were liberated from Auschwitz concentration camp almost 70 years ago. 

Menachem Bodner, 72, turned to Facebook on March 2 to help him find his twin Jeno, nicknamed 'Jolli'. The brothers were separated when Auschwitz was liberated by the Allies towards the end of the Second World War in 1945. 

Menachem, who lives in Israel, is unable to remember much of his time in the Nazi camp but had for many years sensed that there was a part of his life missing.

Desperately seeking my brother: 'Jolli', child survivor A7734 from Auschwitz, is being looked for by his brother who last saw him aged four when the Nazi camp was liberated

Quest: Menachem Bodner 72, is hoping to find his twin brother after a lifetime apart and has turned to Facebook to help him

A genealogist Ayana KimRon helped Menachem prove that he had a twin brother and that his sibling also survived the hellish Nazi concentration camp in occupied Poland. 

According to the Daily Beast, the genealogist said that after receiving news of his brother's existence, Menachem said: 'All my life I’ve known that he was alive somewhere; I felt that he was alive.'

Ms KimRon was able to track down the twin brothers real names as Elias and Jeno Gottesmann at the Candles Holocaust Museum in Terre Haute, Indiana.

After months of searching proved fruitless, the pair turned to Facebook, creating a page called A7734 - using the concentration camp number which was tattooed on Jeno's arm by the Nazis.

The Nazis kept meticulous records of their crimes which revealed this information. Elias Gottesman was tattooed with the number A7733.

The clues as to Jeno's whereabouts
are limited. Ms KimRon writes on Facebook that 'Jolli' was around 
four-and-a-half at the time of the Allies' liberation of the Nazi-run 
camp, having been born in 1940. There is a chance that he was adopted by
a Christian family in America.

The brothers were born in Munkacs, a small town which was formerly in Hungary and is now situated in the Ukraine.

She added: 'Whatever name and location, his tattooed 
number is A7734. And his brother still hopes to meet him. Please help us
by spreading the word.'

Since the creation of the A7734 Facebook page, the response from around the world has been phenomenal.  The photograph has been shared more than 45,000 times and the page liked more than 12,000 times.

Visitors to the Facebook page have left hundreds of comments after being deeply moved by the story of the brother's separation.

One Facebook user, Rochelle Brown-Rainey, poignantly commented: 'My Mother is also a Holocaust survivor. She and her brother were separated for 15 years.

'I remember going to the airport with her and asking her if she brought a picture with her so she could recognize him. She very bluntly said ''He is my brother, of course I will know him when I see him''. I wish the Same Wonderful Moment for these 2 men.'
