A senior U.S. Army officer who works closely with high-ranking staff in the office of the Secretary of Defense told MailOnline on Wednesday that outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is 'relieved' to be leaving the Pentagon.

At a coffee shop a half-mile from the Pentagon, the officer said Hagel complained regularly about having to publicly defend President Barack Obama's military policies and priorities, a job requirement he's eager to leave behind. 

He described Hagel as 'a good guy who ultimately looked in the mirror one day and realized he couldn’t hold his nose anymore.'

'He jumped at the chance to get out, and couldn't wait to announce it so things didn't go more to hell in Iraq and he’d get blamed for it.’

WINTER OF HIS DISCONTENT: Outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel couldn't wait to leave, a high-ranking Pentagon officer says, because he tired of carrying President Obama's water

NEXT 'YES-MAN': Former Deputy Secretary Ashton Carter is expected to be nominated by President Obama to succeed Chuck Hagel as Secretary of Defense

The officer agreed to be quoted anonymously because he is not authorized to speak publicly. It's highly unusual for an active-duty officer to speak so plainly.

Media reports last week largely repeated whispers from inside the White House, concluding that Obama asked for Hagel's resignation because he slow-walked the emptying of the Guantanamo Bay military prison, which is used to house suspected international terrorists.

But CNN reported Tuesday that Hagel himself accelerated his departure.

'He wanted to move quickly,' a Hagel confidante told the network. 

After months of frustration with the White House, that source said, Hagel wanted to 'at least control his departure.' 

His farewell ceremony, which Hagel himself forced the White House to hold before Obama settled on a successor, was a study in contrasts. 

While Obama praised him as a former enlisted soldier who spilled 'blood and treasure' and made 'sacrifices' on the battlefield – and turned to look directly at him frequently – Hagel himself stared ahead and made no eye contact.

MailOnline's Defense Department insider explained Hagel's detached nature as the product of presiding over a Pentagon in disarray and distrustful of its commander-in-chief. 

‘No one wants to be disloyal,' he said. 'But also nobody wants to be on watch while the Defense Department weakens to the point of disintegrating, and America gets pushed around the [global] schoolyard. It’s embarrassing.’

Asked for an assessment of former Deputy Secretary Ashton Carter, now the odds-on lock to succeed Hagel, he said the rank and file like him personally. 

'He's a personable guy – not warm, exactly, but clear-headed and genuine.'

But the rank-and-file expect Carter to be Obama's next 'Yes-man,' he said – which worries them.

TEARS OF RELIEF? Hagel 'couldn't wait to announce it,' a source said, 'so things didn't go more to hell in Iraq and he’d get blamed for it'

‘The ISIS war isn’t going well, we’re being weakened with budget cuts and troop draw-downs, and we can hardly float a navy anymore,' he explained.

'It’s clear the president is doing this intentionally, and he’s looking for someone new to rubber stamp him.’

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who ran unsuccessfully against Obama for the presidency in 2008, told a radio interviewer on the day Hagel announced his departure that he had recently spoken with the defense secretary – and the topic turned to their mutual displeasure with the White House.

'I know Chuck was frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision making process,' McCain told News Talk 550-AM.

'His predecessors have spoken about the excessive micro-management they faced from the White House and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs successfully.Chuck's situation was no different.'
