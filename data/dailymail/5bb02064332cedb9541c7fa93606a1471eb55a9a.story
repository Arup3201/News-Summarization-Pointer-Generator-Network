The firm behind a mock documentary shown on the BBC last night about the ‘disaster’ of a world without the European Union received EU funding, it has emerged.

The Great European Disaster Movie, a 75-minute film screened on BBC4, presented an apocalyptic vision of what would happen if the EU broke apart and warned that it would have ‘catastrophic consequences for all of us’.

It imagined an army of Islamic State terrorists advancing on Vienna, Spain cutting off all routes to Gibraltar and the Prime Minister of ‘Great England’ – Nigel Farage –sending all immigrants home.

It also imagined that the far-Right leader Marine Le Pen was the president of France and had declared a state of emergency.

But last night it emerged that the production company that made it had received EU funding to translate the film and dub it into different languages, so it can be shown in various member states.

Eurosceptic MPs accused the BBC of showing ‘EU propaganda’. Brian Binley, a Tory backbencher, said: ‘I think it’s disgraceful. Here is the EU Commission propagating itself throughout Europe. That is simply unacceptable. It is not a governing institution’s job to use taxpayers’ money to perpetuate itself. It is not the job of the commissioners who run the EU budget to perpetrate their vision.’

The film, presented by journalist Bill Emmott, starred comedian Angus Deayton as an archaeologist explaining the single currency to a young girl on an aeroplane heading for Berlin, after the collapse of the EU and the abolition of the euro.

Mr Deayton laid out – with ‘flashbacks’ to 2014 – the reasons for the EU break-up. The film’s production company, Springshot Productions, said it was depicting ‘a Europe that is sleepwalking towards disaster’, and claimed the film showed that the EU was ‘well worth saving’.

It created ‘a unique, choral portrait of the European dream and how it could be lost forever’. Director Annalisa Piras, an Italian journalist, said it would be shown on a ‘Europe-wide tour’ of universities.

But Ukip MP Mark Reckless, who appeared in a panel discussion with Mr Emmott after last night’s programme, said he had confirmed EU funding was used to make the film.

Mr Reckless said: ‘I asked him if he had received any EU money for it when we appeared on the panel together, and he said they had – for translation into different languages.

‘I thought he might be a bit sheepish but he admitted it to me quite openly. I think he also put in some of his own money and they had other sources of funding for other elements of the film.’

Last night on Twitter, Mr Emmott said the production company had received ‘EU top-up for language versions’. He said the BBC itself had not received any money from the EU for this programme.

However, it has previously been reported that the BBC has received some £22million over a seven-year period from the EU’s communications budget. 

A BBC spokesman said: ‘No EU money was used in the making of the programme being aired on the BBC. Impartiality is of paramount importance for the BBC. This fictional programme reflects the author’s vision.’
