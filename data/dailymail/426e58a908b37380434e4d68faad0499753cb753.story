Mario Balotelli was too hot for England in Manaus. He may not be in the class of Luis Suarez — although he’s probably not inferior to the tune of £59million, as their transfer fees suggest — but he is still a goalscorer capable of defining a match from nowhere, and every title-chasing team needs at least one.

As football becomes increasingly mired in five-man midfields, the biggest games will be decided by one moment of individual genius. There is no doubt Balotelli is capable of providing that.

Yet he is still a risk, no matter how many assurances his new employers require. It is not what Balotelli does that is the problem, but the tension his maverick presence can create.

When Balotelli was at Manchester City it seemed the club was never out of the headlines. It wasn’t ‘Why always me?’ but ‘Why always us?’ — and there is enough pressure on Liverpool already this season without Balotelli drawing the eyes of the world to Anfield.

It is no coincidence Liverpool’s best season was also Suarez’s quietest off the field.

Liverpool need to go about their business this season with the minimum of commotion: Balotelli has all the gift for tranquility of a 10-year-old with a birthday drum kit.

So, where does Di Maria fit in?

Angel Di Maria was as good as any player at Real Madrid last season, even Cristiano Ronaldo. One imagines if coach Carlo Ancelotti had control over transfer policy he would not be on his way out. Madrid need to feed the brand image annually, however, and James Rodriguez was one of the stars of the World Cup. So he’s in and Di Maria is out — and Manchester United are the beneficiaries.

Di Maria’s fee, anywhere between £60million and £75m depending on reports, would put him up with the greatest players in the world. Is he worth that? Perhaps to a club that needs a world-class attacking wide player to complete their vision.

Is that Manchester United, though, particularly when Louis van Gaal’s game plan calls for wing-backs? Where, for instance, does this leave Adnan Januzaj, the one bright spark for United last season? Can Di Maria and Januzaj protect a back three? And what then happens to Luke Shaw?

In the last transfer window, United responded to growing frustration with the £37m marquee signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea. At the time it looked a great buy, if costly. Yet it quickly became plain that United’s problems lay elsewhere.

Di Maria? He’s a brilliant, energetic, creative forward that any club would be lucky to have. But Manchester United, for the same fee as Luis Suarez? Is this their priority?

The jury is out.
