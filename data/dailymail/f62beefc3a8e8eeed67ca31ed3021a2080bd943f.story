If the spy drama Homeland, which finishes its fourth season tonight, seems a little too realistic, perhaps that's because it is rooted in a series of incidents that actually happened.

The programme focuses on the so-called 'drone war' and the conflict between the CIA and the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI), which has been the source of much of the real tension between the two countries.

Here, security journalist Duncan Gardham, who specialises in terrorism and espionage, looks at the comparisons between the popular television series and real life events.   

Parallels: Numan Acar plays Haissam Haqqani, the villain in the fourth series of Homeland (left) and (right) in real life, Jalaluddin Haqqani, is leader of a major faction of the Taliban, known as the Haqqani network

The Villain

'Haqqani' is the villain of the fourth series of Homeland, a member of the Taliban who lives a secret life in the tribal areas of Pakistan, moving from place to place, targeted by American drones, but covertly supported by the Pakistani ISI.

In real life, Jalaluddin Haqqani is the leader of a major faction of the Taliban, known as the Haqqani network, that straddles the border in Khost, Afghanistan and North Waziristan in Pakistan.  

Once funded by the Americans in the fight against Soviet Russia, they have remained a Pakistani asset but regularly launch attacks against coalition troops in Afghanistan.

Haqqani and his son Sirujuddin, have been the subject of a number of CIA drone strikes, including one in September 2008 which hit a house in the village Dandi Darpa Khail in North Waziristan, killing between 10 and 23 people. Haqqani had already left the area.

Shoot out

CIA station chief Sandy Bachman is killed when the vehicle he is travelling in with Carrie Mathieson and Peter Quinn, is surrounded by an angry mob and he is dragged from the vehicle. 

Mathieson and Quinn survive by shooting into the crowd.

In real life, CIA contractor Ray Davis shot two men on a motorbike on the streets of Lahore in January 2011, thinking they were about to rob him at gunpoint but this scene is more reminiscent of a harrowing incident in March 1988 during the Troubles in Northern Ireland when two plain clothed British Army corporals, David Howes and Derek Wood, were dragged from their car and killed after getting caught in an IRA funeral procession. 

The incident was captured by television cameras, and two men were later jailed for the killings.

Suicide vest

Carrie Mathieson is able to retrieve the situation and the exchange goes ahead.

Bowe Bergdahl, then a private in the US army, was abducted after wandering away from his unit in Pakitika, Afghanistan in June 2009 and held captive for five years by the Haqqani network.

This scene is also reminiscent of a double cross at Camp Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan in which an agent run by the Pakistani Taliban blew up Jennifer Lynne Matthews (pictured), the female CIA station chief, and six members of her staff using a suicide vest

At one stage he apparently escaped but was recaptured after five days, and during his captivity he was forced to make three videos pleading for his release. 

A prisoner exchange for five men held by the Americans went ahead in May 2014, filmed by the Haqqanis. 

This scene is also reminiscent of a double cross at Camp Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan in which an agent run by the Pakistani Taliban blew up Jennifer Lynne Matthews, the female CIA station chief, and six members of her staff using a suicide vest.

In the Channel 4 series, the Taliban mastermind battling CIA station chief Carrie Mathieson (pictured) is very much alive, pulling the strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the Americans

Homeland reaches the end of the fourth series tonight - the programme bears similarities to real life events

Abandoned building 

Returning from the prisoner exchange the CIA convoy carrying Carrie Mathieson and Saul Berenson is attacked with guns and rocket propelled grenades from a half-finished building near a roundabout.

In September 2011 Haqqani fighters used an unfinished high-rise building in Kabul to launch a 20-hour attack on the US embassy, killing 16 Afghans and leading to the deaths of 11 assailants.

In 1979, radical students stormed the US embassy in Islamabad, ransacked it and set buildings on fire

Over-running the US Embassy

The attack on the convoy is actually a diversion so that Haqqani and a band of fighters can get into the US Embassy where the CIA staff are forced to destroy documents and retire into a strong room from where they see other members of staff executed.

In 1979, radical students stormed the US embassy in Islamabad, ransacked it and set buildings on fire. 

The CIA burned critical documents and staff survived by hiding in a reinforced area, although Marine Security Guard Steve Crowley, Army Warrant Officer Bryan Ellis, and two Pakistani members of staff were killed in the attack.
