Chelsea hope manager Jose Mourinho will remain in charge for the next 10 years.

That is according to chief executive Ron Gourlay, who was quoted in the London Evening Standard.

Gourlay praises Mourinho for his knowledge of the club, and his ability to drive the Blues forward.

Diego Costa has been in fine form for Chelsea this season

‘I hope he will stay 10 years,’ Gourlay said. ‘Having the security of Jose is great for me - he knows the club, knows me. Jose can deal with the media in a different way from some of the other managers we’ve had.

‘He takes the pressure not only away from the players but also from the club. He allows us to manage and me in particular to drive the club forward.’

Mourinho won six trophies during his previous three-year spell at the club and was brought back last summer to oversee a new dawn under Roman Abramovich.

Jose Mourinho's side are top of the league and have won all of their Premier League games this season

Chelsea challenged for the Premier League title last season and look to be on their way for more silverware this year with Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas starting well.

Jose has had success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid and doesn't tend to stay in one job for too long, but fans will hope Gourlay's wish can become a reality at Stamford Bridge.
