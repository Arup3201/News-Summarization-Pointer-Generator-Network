Frank Kirk, 70, was arrested last month after he allegedly brought sex toys to a woman at the county jail

An attorney has been charged after he allegedly tried to prevent a female inmate from testifying against him over sex acts he engaged in with her in prison.

Frank Kirk, 70, from Oklahoma, was arrested last month after he allegedly engaged in lewd acts with the woman at the county jail.

Kirk brought sex toys, lubricant, baby wipes and a cell phone into the jail in a hidden compartment of his laptop bag, court documents revealed.

The female alleged that Kirk gave her the items so that he could watch her masturbate, according to a probable cause affidavit seen by newsok.com.

The prisoner also alleges that he told her to expose her breasts and forced her to touch his penis.

Kirk allegedly duped the woman into performing the acts over a three-month period in exchange for her legal fees - despite the fact that he was never actually her lawyer.

The woman, who is jailed on drug charges, is represented by the public defender's office so it is unclear why she believed Kirk to be her lawyer. Her identity has been withheld.Â 

Kirk was arrested on March 3 after the sex acts allegedly took place four of the six times that Kirk visited the inmate in jail.

On March 21, Kirk allegedly contacted the woman to try to intimidate her out of testifying against him.

'The victim was fearful of testifying against Kirk', the affidavit reads, according to newsok.com.

He was charged on Monday with one felony count of attempting to prevent a witness from testifying.

He was also charged with five misdemeanor counts of lewdness.

Kirk is out on $10,000 bail.
