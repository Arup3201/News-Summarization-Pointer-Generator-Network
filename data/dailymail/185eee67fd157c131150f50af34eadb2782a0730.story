Danny Welbeck may have already left the World Cup but that hasn't stopped the England frontman from enjoying the rest of the tournament.

The Manchester United striker has been holidaying in New York following the Three Lions' early exit from the competition at the group stage.

Welbeck - who was snapped wearing orange glasses and a glow-stick necklace - partied with friends at Lavo nightclub in the city's midtown neighborhood on Saturday and watched Colombia's 2-0 victory over Uruguay.

There's no doubting Welbeck will have 
been impressed with the finishing of James Rodriguez as the Monaco 
wideman spectacularly sent Los Cafeteros into the quarter-finals with a brace.

The 23-year-old started England's opening two World Cup matches as Roy Hodgson's side were beaten by Italy and Uruguay but was left out for the goalless draw with Costa Rica.

Welbeck and Co were sent packing from the World Cup having claimed just a single point in Group D, having scored a paltry two goals.

The attacker isn't the only England star to be spending time in America - Daniel Sturridge made an appearance at the BET awards in Los Angeles while Wayne Rooney and wife Coleen are currently holidaying in Las Vegas.
