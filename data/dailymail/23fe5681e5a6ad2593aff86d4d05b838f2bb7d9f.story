Iain Duncan Smith has been championing Universal Credit reforms for four years, but yesterday a quango was forced to invent a new rating to describe the project's failures

Iain Duncan Smith’s flagship welfare reform is going so badly that a watchdog has had to a create a whole new category to describe its failures.

The Work and Pensions Secretary’s scheme to replace six separate benefits with a single Universal Credit was sent back to the drawing board last year following serious delays and cost overruns.

The Major Projects Authority (MPA), the quango that assesses how effectively large schemes are being implemented, yesterday concluded that its worst rating was not bad enough to accommodate all the failings associated with Universal Credit.

The fact that the Government published the damning study amid the announcement of local election results led to accusations that ministers were seeking to ‘bury’ bad news.

The findings are a huge embarrassment for Mr Duncan Smith, who has championed the reform of welfare for the past four years.

The authority’s assessment covered 199 government projects. Each was graded using a five-tier traffic-light system from green for the best-run schemes and red for the worst, via green/amber, amber and amber/red.

However, Universal Credit has been given a category all of its own – ‘reset’, reflecting the fact that it has had to be started all over again.

‘We have undertaken significant work to develop a “reset plan” to place the rollout of Universal Credit on a more secure footing, and the “reset” delivery confidence assessment reflects this new status of the project,’ said the MPA.

The Department for Work and Pensions said the judgment was out of date because it made its assessment of the project last September.

A spokesman said there had since been progress in implementing the scheme through a limited number of pilots in Jobcentres.

‘Universal Credit is on track,’ she said. ‘The reset is not new but refers to the shift in the delivery plan and change in management back in early 2013.

The project was  rated as 'reset' to highlighting the fact that the scheme had to be started over. The single benefit, which replaces a host of other handouts, is now being trialled in a limited number of Jobcentres

‘The reality is that Universal Credit is already making work pay as we roll it out in a careful and controlled way. It’s already operating in ten areas and will start expanding to the rest of the North West in June.’

Other major schemes fared poorly in the review, with the delivery of two aircraft carriers rated ‘red’ for the second year in a row.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said the increased proportion of ratings from amber to red was a result of more projects overall being under way and new projects inevitably appearing higher risk in their early stages.

‘As part of this Government’s long-term economic plan we are improving the way our projects are run, helping save £1.2billion in 2012/13 alone,’ he said.

John Manzoni, chief executive of the MPA, said his organisation was focusing on ensuring that the Government does projects ‘the right way’.

‘Critical to this is building leadership capability, clarifying project leaders’ accountability and responsibility for delivery,’ he said.

In a further embarrassment for Mr Duncan Smith, the MPA gave his Work Programme, a scheme to create a single welfare-to-work programme for all the unemployed, an ‘amber’ rating.

Spending watchdogs yesterday gave the  HS2 rail project an ‘amber-red’ warning,  meaning it runs a ‘serious risk’ of failing.

Their official report warned the success of the £50billion scheme remains ‘in doubt’ with ‘major risks in a number of areas’ which require ‘urgent action’.

The alarming verdict by the Major Projects Authority follows criticism that figures for the 300-mile high-speed line linking London to Birmingham and then the North simply do not add up.

It follows an earlier amber-red assessment on HS2 in an internal report, which the Government refused to make public.

This led the Information Commissioner to start a legal case, which is continuing, to force details to be revealed.

The HS2 project it at 'serious risk' of failing with 'major risks in a number of areas' which require' urgent action'

The latest rating is based on concerns about the sums underlying the project which critics insist simply do not add up.

These includes worries about costs spinning out of control, the environmental impact, amount of compensation and how much the North will benefit economically.

There are also concerns that the fragile cross-party political consensus, particularly between the Conservatives and Labour, could fracture.

The amber-red grading is the second worst of five running from red for ‘unachievable’ to green for success being ‘highly likely’.

The MPA annual report has been seized on by opponents of the rail project. Penny Gaines, chairman of Stop HS2 said: ‘The Department for Transport may claim it is a project in excellent shape but the evidence says otherwise.’

Richard Houghton, of HS2 Action Alliance, said the report was ‘no surprise’, adding: ‘This project is running out of control.’

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘HS2 has made significant progress in the eight months since the evidence for this report was gathered. We are on track to have spades in the ground in 2017.’

The HS2 Bill survived its second reading despite a rebellion by dozens of Tory MPs.

A rail project to decide the Essex Thameside franchise was also labelled amber-red.
