Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has warned goalkeeper Joe Hart that he faces a battle to keep his place from new signing Willy Caballero this season.

Pellegrini must decide who to play in Sunday’s Community Shield against Arsenal at Wembley after acknowledging that he now has ‘two No 1 goalkeepers’.

Caballero, a £6million signing from Pellegrini’s old club Malaga, has primarily been brought in as back-up for Hart but on the understanding that he will offer more of a challenge to the England goalkeeper than the departed Costel Pantilimon.

Safe? Joe Hart has been warned that he faces a battle to keep his place in City's starting line-up

The 32-year-old Argentine played in the majority of games on City’s pre-season tour of America while Hart recovered after the World Cup, and has made no secret of his desire to become first-choice at the Etihad.

Pellegrini, who dropped Hart for seven Premier League games at the end of last year due to a loss of form, said: ‘I will make the decision who will start — not only the goalkeeper, the whole team.

‘I have two No 1 goalkeepers, I have two No 1 full backs, right and left, and in other positions.

‘Willy has settled in very well. I know him from Malaga and he’s a very good goalkeeper. That is why I say we have a stronger squad than last year. I’m sure Willy will be very important for us, but I also continue thinking we have the best goalkeeper in England in Joe Hart.

‘Top teams need two players for each position because we have to play so many games during the year. When we finish the season I can tell you if he (Hart) has had more or less opposition.’

City’s remaining World Cup contingent — captain Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Fernandinho, Bacary Sagna and Frank Lampard — are not fit enough yet to play in the traditional curtain-raiser and some may struggle to be ready for next weekend’s opening Premier League game at Newcastle. 

However, it is understood that the Premier League champions are on the brink of making their fourth signing of the summer with confirmation of Eliaquim Mangala’s £32m move from FC Porto said to be imminent.

Mangala’s arrival will coincide with Javi Garcia’s departure to Zenit St Petersburg after City agreed a £12m fee and £800,000 in add-ons based on the Russian club’s success in Europe.

Mangala’s former Porto team-mate Fernando, who joined City from the Portuguese club for £12m earlier this summer, is sure the Frenchman will make an impact.

‘I’ve played with him for a long time, he’s a great player and a friend as well,’ he said. ‘He’s very quick and strong, very competitive.

‘With his characteristics, he might bring an element to the team that City doesn’t have.’

Fernando will challenge fellow Brazilian Fernandinho for a defensive midfield role this season and, like Caballero, is determined to fight for a first-team place.

The 27-year-old watched Brazil’s humbling 7-1 defeat to Germany at the World Cup — a match in which Fernandinho was replaced at half-time — and when asked if he could have reinforced the team answers ‘Naturally’.

He added: ‘I have a very strong defensive game and that is going to help us a lot because teams will take advantage of City being so attacking, on the counter-attack. I’m going to add very good value in that sense.

‘There are some great players here but I know my strengths and will work hard to make sure I’m first choice.’

Although Fernando will compete with Fernandinho for a place, they might also play together, which would present a problem for commentators.

City team-mates have already devised a way to differentiate.

‘I think they’re calling Fernandinho “Fay” and me “Nando”,’ he said.

Fernando was speaking at Manchester City’s Community Shield media day at Carrington, where he helped the club’s community coaches train children from local schools and sports clubs in a free soccer school.
