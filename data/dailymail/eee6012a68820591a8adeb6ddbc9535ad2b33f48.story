Politicians must pledge that future wars will be short with clear goals that will convince a 'war-weary' public, says Defence Secretary Philip Hammond

Politicians must pledge that future wars will be short with clear goals that will convince a ‘war-weary’ public, says Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

A decade of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan has led to a ‘climate of scepticism’ and an ‘irrational fear’ about military intervention in  broken states, he says.

Even the threat of terrorism from volatile foreign countries no longer convinced British people that war was necessary.

His comments – made at the weekend during a debate at the Munich Security Conference – came as it emerged that he had urged ministers to lobby unions to back Trident.

Mr Hammond fears that Labour will ‘wobble’ over the need for a nuclear deterrent and has called for the unions to press Labour on the threat this would pose to Britain’s shipbuilding industry.

But his warning of an ‘irrational’ fear of war among British voters will provoke more controversy. ‘There is a climate of scepticism about engagement in failed or failing countries, a fear of getting entrapped in longer term, deeper forms of engagement,’ he said.

‘Increasingly we need to present intervention as time-limited and with strictly defined ambitions.

‘We are at a point in the UK where there is a war-weariness after ten years of engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan.

‘There is definitely a fear, quite irrational in some cases, that any engagement anywhere will somehow lead to an uncontrollable commitment to large numbers of troops, a large amount of resources and a long-term intervention.’

MPs last year rejected David Cameron’s call for military strikes on the Assad regime in Syria in a surprise Commons defeat. 

Mr Hammond said the public no longer seemed to fear the consequences of the proliferation of chemical weapons.

MPs last year rejected David Cameron's call for military strikes on the Assad regime in Syria in a surprise Commons defeat.

‘It is very clear to those of us looking in horror at this emerging situation in Syria that we are creating a new hotbed of international terrorism, a new base from which international terrorism will operate that will probably rival any of those we have seen in the last decade or so,’ he said.

‘We are allowing this to happen and yet public opinion in Western countries is not yet persuaded that military intervention will be justified or in their own self-interest. It will be a long time before anyone forgets the mistakes of Iraq.’

Mr Hammond has also told colleagues of his fears that Labour MPs and peers are putting pressure on party leader Ed Miliband not to back a replacement of Trident.

Defence ministers Mark Francois and Lord Astor have been told to lobby Labour’s union supporters within the shipbuilding industry.

‘The Tories don’t want Labour having a wobble on this,’ said a Whitehall source.

Labour says Mr Hammond should ‘keep his nose out’ of party affairs and that Mr Miliband is committed to Trident.
