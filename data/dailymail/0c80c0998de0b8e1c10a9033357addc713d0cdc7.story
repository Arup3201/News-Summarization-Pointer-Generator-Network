A student nurse who injected coffee into the veins of an 80-year-old patient has defended herself by saying 'anyone can get confused'.

Rejane Moreira Telles, 23, said she had just three days of work experience in the clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when she mixed up administering a drip.

The elderly patient Palmerina Pires Ribeiro, died hours after she had the coffee mixed with milk injected straight into her system.

Excuses: Trainee nurse Rejane Moreira Telles said anyone could have made the same mistake

Fatal mistake: Ms Telles says she mixed up the drip and the coffee because they were next to each other

Rejane Moreira Telles, appeared on BrazilianTV Globo's Fantastico show where she said she was aware of the risk of administering an intravenous feed.

Miss Telles said: 'But, as they [the feed and blood drips] were next to each other, anyone can get confused.

'I injected the coffee and I put it in the wrong place'.

Miss
Telles, who has been indicted for involuntary manslaughter alongside 
two nurses and another student, also claimed she had not been trained 
for that kind of procedure.

Witness: The victim's daughter Loreni said she witnessed the trainee nurse give her mother the coffee injection

Riberio died last week at a clinic in São João de Meriti, in the Baixada Fluminense region of the state of Rio de Janeiro.

Doctors contacted by the popular television programme said that the milky coffee would have gone directly to the pensioner's heart and lungs.

Dr Armando Carreir, nutritional specialist at the Federal University of Fluminens' Hospital Antonio Pedro, said: 'It would have been as if the patient was suffocating.'

The victim's daughter, Loreni Ribeiro, added: 'I saw my mother was agitated, she opened her mouth, and this youngster put coffee with milk into the vein's of my mother. Half a glass.'
