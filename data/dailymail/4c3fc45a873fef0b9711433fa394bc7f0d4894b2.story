Blocking out the sun: A bushfire burns near Ouse, north of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia

More than 100 people are missing in catastrophic bushfires that are ravaging the Australian island of Tasmania.

Some 1,000 people were rescued by boat from the east coast after fires cut off roads, but police say they hold 'grave fears' for a number of residents who stayed to defend their homes but have not been heard from.

It comes amid the hottest temperatures ever recorded on the island, peaking at 41.8C (107F) on Friday.

As fires continued to burn yesterday, police and rescue experts began the grim search for bodies in the worst-hit towns of Boomer Bay, where 65 properties were lost, and Dunalley, both in the south-east of the island.

The Queen and Prince Charles have sent messages of sympathy to those who have lost homes.

Emergency services have been searching burned-out vehicles and homes in the towns worst hit by the wildfires, which began on Thursday and have been fanned by strong winds.

More than 40 fires are still raging on the island as a result of the fiercest heatwave to hit Australia in more than a decade.

Emergency services have been searching burned-out vehicles and homes in the towns worst hit by the wildfires, which began on Thursday and have been fanned by strong winds.

Firefighters have issued an emergency warning in Taranna, 47km (29 miles) east of the state capital Hobart, where a fire burning for more than three days has threatened residents.

Fire crews from Victoria and South 
Australia headed to Tasmania on Sunday to help fatigued crews there, 
while fires burned on in mainland states South Australia, Victoria, and 
New South Wales.

Speaking on Friday, Tasmania Fire Service chief 
officer Mike Brown said:  'We reached catastrophic fire danger 
ratings at times during this afternoon.Â

The
national weather bureau warned this weekend's relative mildness would 
be a brief reprieve, with extremely hot conditions set to return to much
of the country early next week.

The fires that continue to burn in Tasmania have cut off communities and hampered efforts to search devastated areas.

In the small town of Dunalley, 56km east of Hobart, more than 80 homes and buildings and a school have been destroyed. The carnage included the town's school, police station and a bakery.

There had been reports of a fatality but
police later confirmed that there have been no reported deaths as a 
result of the fires.

Nearby Boomer Bay and Marion Bay have also suffered damage.

Acting Police Commissioner Scott Tilyard told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) there were about 100 people with whom authorities are still trying to make contact.

It may take days to determine whether the fires have killed anyone during what is the peak holiday season on the island.

'We're hoping very much along with everyone else that there won't be (any deaths), but we need to go through the process to confirm that there haven't been,' Tilyard told ABC.

Bushfires are a major risk in the Australian summer, which brings extreme heat, dryness, and strong winds.

Authorities warned earlier in the summer that much of the country faced extreme fire conditions this season.

The
Black Saturday fires, the worst in Australia's history, killed 173 
people and destroyed more than 2,000 homes in Victoria in February 2009.

Australia's wheat 
harvest is unlikely to be affected by the fires and hot weather, as the 
vast majority of this season's crop has been harvested, analysts said.
