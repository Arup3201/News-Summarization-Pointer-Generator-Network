Strikes by Home Office staff at Britain's borders aimed at paralysing airports during London 2012 are not justifiable or right, David Cameron has said.

The Prime Minister today waded into the row after thousands of immigration staff voted to walk out over jobs, pay and other issues.

Members of the Public and Commercial Services Union could go on strike within a week, it was announced last night.

Concerns: Fears of travel chaos during the Olympics have been raised after thousands of staff at the Home Office - including airport immigration workers - voted to go on strike

Mr Cameron, who is in Kabul, Afghanistan, said this morning: 'There was a 20 per cent turn out and a very narrow margin.'

He added that strike action should not take place, adding: 'I do not think it would be right, I do not think it would be justifiable.'

Union sources said the strike would be
 timed to cause ‘maximum pain’. Critics accused union bosses of ‘deeply 
unpatriotic’ behaviour.

The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said 57% of its members had backed a campaign of action in protest at 'cuts'.

While 16,000 PCS members in the Home Office were balloted, with a 57% vote for strikes and 75% majority for other forms of action, the turnout was just 20%.

Barely
 11 per cent of PCS union members at the Home Office voted in favour of 
the walkout in protest over cuts to jobs and pay freezes. That amounts 
to just 1,800 people out of 16,000 potential voters.

Anger: The Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Mark Serwotka said ministers have known about issues concerning members of his union but have chosen not to act

Dominic
 Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘For Mark Serwotka [PCS 
general secretary] to threaten to target the Olympics when just 11 per 
cent of his own members back a strike is self-indulgent, reckless and 
deeply unpatriotic.

‘There 
is no credible basis for this vindictive strike action – a militant 
minority led by a union head-banger should not be allowed to paralyse 
the Games.’

Most Olympic athletes, who were given dedicated fast track immigration lanes, are expected to be here by the end of this week.

But next week ports and airports are braced for the main influx of Games visitors from overseas. Heathrow is expecting to handle around 120,000 arrivals each day next week.

Union bosses will meet tomorrow to set 
dates for one or more days of strikes during the summer and autumn. Any 
strike before the opening ceremony on July 27 would be hugely 
disruptive.

A union source said: ‘We will target 
those areas which will cause maximum pain for the employer but minimise 
the impact for our employees taking long periods of strike action. They 
have made the dispute about the Olympics with the way they have gone 
about using temporary staff so they can staff all the desks during the 
Games.’

A walkout within the coming months 
could also hit hundreds of thousands of families heading overseas for 
their summer holiday. Many schools break up on Friday.

Worrying: It is thought any strike just before the opening ceremony of the Olympics on July 27 could have a big impact on people travelling to the UK to watch the event

PCS members make up around 5,000 out of 8,000 Border Force staff who check passports at ports and airports.

Ministers have pledged that every immigration post at Heathrow will be manned during the busy summer period to combat the huge queues and delays seen at the airport this spring.

But this promise will be extremely difficult to meet if thousands of PCS members walk out. The strike will also affect staff in the Passport Agency, Criminal Records Bureau and the main Home Office.

Immigration Minister Damian Green said:

'I call on the union to call off this 
irresponsible proposed strike. A decision to strike is completely 
unacceptable and we believe the public will have no sympathy with the 
union's decision.

'Only about 1 in 10 PCS members voted 
for strike action. The union leadership has no authority to call 
disruptive strikes on that basis and should think again.

'The security of the UK border is of 
the utmost importance and we will use our trained pool of contingency 
staff to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union 
action.

'Any action that disrupts the Olympics will be completely unacceptable and the public will not support it.'

Some 16,000 PCS members in the Home Office were balloted, and turnout was just 20 per cent, meaning some 3,200 voted. Of those, just 57 per cent voted in favour of strikes, or around 1,830 people.

Three quarters of those who did vote backed other forms of industrial action, such as working to rule and refusing to work overtime.

Mr Serwotka claimed ministers were undermining the Home Office’s ability to provide ‘vital public services’. He said: ‘Ministers have known about these issues for a very long time but have chosen not to act.

‘We believe they have acted recklessly and irresponsibly in cutting so many jobs and, in the case of the UK Border Agency, they have simply tried to paper over the cracks by deploying severely undertrained staff at our borders.

‘If these issues are not resolved, they threaten to seriously undermine the Home Office’s ability to provide vital public services.'

London bus workers have voted to accept an offer of an Olympics bonus, ending the threat of another strike.

The Unite union said workers will get £577 in recognition of the 'massive increase' in workload over the Games.

Thousands of bus workers went on strike last month and were threatening further walkouts.

In workplace ballots held yesterday 71 per cent voted to accept the offer.

The bus workers will get a payment of £27.50 each time they complete a 
duty over the 29 days of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The 
average number of duties workers will complete will be 21, meaning most 
workers will get a £577 award.

Peter Kavanagh, Unite's regional secretary for London, said: 'After 
almost a year-long campaign, bus workers finally have a fair deal which 
recognises their contribution to keeping London moving over the 
Olympics.'
