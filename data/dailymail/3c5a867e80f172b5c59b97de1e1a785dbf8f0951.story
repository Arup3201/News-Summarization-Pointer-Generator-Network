'Accident': Thai senator Boonsong Kowawisarat (pictured) shot his ex-wife dead when he mistakenly fired an Uzi submachine gun during a family meal

A Thai senator accidentally shot his ex-wife dead with a submachine gun during a family meal in a restaurant, police have said.

Boonsong Kowawisarat fatally injured Chanakarn Detkard, 46, when he mistakenly fired the 9mm Uzi as he tried to put it away after placing it on the table.

Chanakarn, who worked as the senator's secretary, suffered a bullet wound to the stomach and died on the way to hospital, according to local police.

Officers said around five family 
members had been sitting in a private dining area of the Garden Resort, 
in Phrae province, northern Thailand, when the gun went off on Sunday 
evening.

Police said 
Boonsong, 56, who is the senate representative for northern Mae Hong Son
province, will be charged with causing death by negligence.

He faces a maximum of ten years imprisonment and a 20,000 baht (Â£405) fine, reports the Bangkok Post.

Boonsong and his wife had been separated for a while but had been living together, police said.

Officers
have yet to arrest the senator - a member of the upper house of the 
Thai parliament - as he is protected by parliamentary privilege, the 
Bangkok Post reported.

Fatal: Kowawisarat had been trying to put the 9mm Uzi (like the one pictured) away after placing it on the table at a restaurant when the weapon discharged

Officials said it was unclear why the senator was armed at the meal.

'From
our initial inquiry, the secretary's family will not sue because they 
were relatives and it was an accident - he did not mean to do it,' a 
local police officer said.

Boonsong legally owned the machine gun, police said.
