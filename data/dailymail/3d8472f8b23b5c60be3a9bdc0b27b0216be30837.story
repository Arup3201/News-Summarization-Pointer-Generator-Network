Forensic experts are battling to identify the remains of around 1,000 bodies believed to be Cyprus' lost citizens, who disappeared during the Turkish invasion more than 40 years ago.

The
 Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus (CMP), a joint initiative, has 
exhumed around 1,000 bodies since 2006 and identified half of them.

It
 would take 10 years to finish the majority of cases, says Paul-Henri 
Arni, the UN representative to the committee, which operates based on an
 agreed amnesty for perpetrators.

'We don't have that much time, because witnesses are dying as well as direct relatives.'

Relatives of the many of Cypriots who 
disappeared more than 40 years ago during a decade of unrest are still 
unable to bury their loved ones because their bodies have never been 
found.

The lost citizens vanished during fighting that broke out in 1974.

The unrest culminated in a Turkish 
invasion ten years later after a coup engineered by Greece's military 
dictatorship aimed at reunifying the island.

Some 2,000 of the country's one million strong population are still missing, and they 
remain an obstacle to efforts to bring the island back together, a third of which is
 still controlled by Turkey.

Marios
 Kouloumas last saw his father 40 years ago as he was led away by 
Turkish soldiers -  one of hundreds of Greek and Turkish Cypriots who 
disappeared during a decade of unrest.

But even though he knows he is dead, he has never been able to mourn him.

Mr Kouloumas was ten years old when he saw his father detained alongside five other villagers.

He said: 'Every day you read in the newspaper about missing persons, every day you have to call somebody to ask about what happened.'

He and his family have kept the memory of his father alive with photographs and, in keeping with 
local tradition, naming three children in the family Nicolas, after 
the grandfather they will never know.

Mr Kouloumasm said he is certain his father is dead - as a piece of the man's skull was found in
 the bottom of a well in 2010 - but the rest of the body has never been 
recovered, so he has not been laid to rest in accordance with Orthodox 
Christianity.

'The 
relationship with dead people is very important for us,' Kouloumas says.

Cyprus was divided in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.

The
 most recent round of talks, which aimed at forging a federation between
 the Turkish Cypriot north and the internationally recognized Greek 
Cypriot south, ground to a halt in the middle of 2012.

The two sides relaunched peace talks aimed at reunifying Cyprus last month after a two-year hiatus.

But several previous rounds have failed, in part because of still-raw emotions on both sides of the UN-patrolled Green Line.

'Every Saturday we go to the cemetary to light candles, bring flowers. 
If you have no one to talk to there, it's very hard.'

'Sometimes
 we find personal belongings next to the remains - and then it hits us 
that these people had a life, a family, maybe a wife and children that 
have never seen them again,' says Hazar Kaba, a Turkish Cypriot who 
works with the CMP.

He says 
the grim work has helped him 'to know my country better, to know my 
past, face my past, and respect everyone in this country'.

The slow process means relatives of hundreds of Cypriots who disappeared more than 40 years ago during a decade of unrest are still unable to bury their loved ones because their bodies have never been found

Dozens of skeletons are being processed in CMP's laboratory, where it takes months to reconstruct them and establish their identity using DNA testing

Christiana Zenonos, a Greek Cypriot whose grandfather is among the missing, agrees.

'We are building friendship across communities,' she says.

 of skeletons are being processed in CMP's laboratory, where it takes 
months to reconstruct them and establish their identity using DNA 
testing, sometimes supported by a wallet, clothing or jewellery found 
with the remains.

'When a 
missing person is identified, the pain begins to go away little by 
little,' says Theophilos Theophilou, who represents Greek Cypriots on 
the CMP.

'Seeing their 
bones, it's a very difficult moment, but it's also a relief,' says 
Meryem Kasif, a Turkish Cypriot whose four brothers disappeared in 1974 
and were identified in January.

Their
 graves are being prepared in the family's village and they will soon be
 laid to rest in a ceremony for dozens of other Turkish Cypriots who 
disappeared from the same village on the same day.

'We're going to bury them near to us so that we can visit them when we want and talk to them, and pray,' she says.
