Manuel Pellegrini believes Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero 'has all the qualities' to be able to win the Ballon d'Or in the near future.

The Argentine striker was hampered by injury last season but still managed to score 26 goals in all competitions for the Blues, while he has managed three goals in four appearances this season.

The City boss believes his star striker can break the trend of either crisitiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi winning the coveted award.

Pellegrini told the Sunday People: 'I think Aguero is among the best players in the world. And I think that now it is up to him to make it and fight for the Ballon d’Or, because he has all the qualities you can ask of a football player.

'He is technically very strong, he is fast and has a lot of power. He is very intelligent, able to play in his position in between midfield and attack.'

Aguero scored City's opening goal against Arsenal on Saturday as Pellegrini's side played out a 2-2 with the Gunners at the Emirates.
