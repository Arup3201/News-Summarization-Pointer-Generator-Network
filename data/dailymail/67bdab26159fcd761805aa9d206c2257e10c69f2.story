Javier Hernandez wants to stay at Real Madrid when his loan deal expires at the end of the season, admitting he has always dreamed of playing for the La Liga giants.

Hernandez fell out of favour at Manchester United last season, only starting six Premier League matches, and believes his Old Trafford career is over.

'They thought I couldn't help any more at United so we decided by mutual agreement that I would leave,' Hernandez told ESPN Deportes. 'It was difficult, although I had offers from other teams, but when I got the opportunity to come to Real Madrid I didn't hesitate.'

Fairly used to a bit-part role, the Mexican striker has only started one league match for Carlo Ancelotti's side, but admits he knew that would be the case when he joined them on transfer deadline day in September.

'It was the toughest challenge [I was offered] and the one that gave me the least chances [of first-team football], but these are the challenges I like and the ones I've worked for all my life. 

'I dreamed of being here. I have the talent and I'll work hard to show I belong at such a great institution. I hope some positive things happen, both to the club and myself.'

Hernandez made 154 appearances for the Red Devils in four years at the club, scoring 59 goals in the process, but moved out on loan when Louis van Gaal took over in the summer.
