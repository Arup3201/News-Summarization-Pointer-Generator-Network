In 1964, Daily founded the West Cape May Community Christmas Parade which she ran for 49 years until her death. Despite her diminutive size -- she stood only 4 feet 11 inches tall, she was known for keeping the parade orderly and smooth.

'She always wanted to make sure there was a good spread between the floats and the fire trucks,' her oldest daughter, Victoria Kelly-Kuhn, told the Press of Atlantic City.

Daily's funeral procession went along the same route as the Christmas parade she took so much pride in

Inside the coffin, Daily was dressed in a Mummers outfit, which was then placed on a float. It then proceeded down the same streets as the Christmas parade. The route include going past Borough Hall, where she worked as a municipal clerk for more than 20 years.

'My mother would be ecstatic. She loved everything gregarious, colorful and flamboyant,' said Kelly-Kuhn.

The only difference between the parade and the funeral procession was where the was where the float ended -- Cold Spring Cemetery.

Daily began preparing for the parade months in advance, according to her youngest daughter Becky Daily Horton.

'Mom would start in early September putting cans in stores and going door-to-door for donation,' she said. 'I remember girls coming over and mom sewing with them. The phone was always ringing. People were coming and going. Growing up with the parade was a very exciting time.'

A descent of Pilgrims who came aboard the Mayflower, Daily was a religious woman who fought hard to keep Christian symbols in the parade when critics had argued it violated the separation of church and state.

She was also patriotic, and her coffin had a photo of the American flag and eagle on it. Along the procession route, children held flags.

Daily leaves behind five children, 21 grandchildren, 21 great grandchildren and three great great-great grandchildren.
