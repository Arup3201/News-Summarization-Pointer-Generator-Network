Bryan Ferry's son Merlin has been making a steady recovery since his car crash last month.

The 24-year-old was involved in a horrific three-car collision on a country lane in Shropshire, the West Midlands just before Christmas, during which he suffered multiple fractures and a head injury.

Merlin - who is former Roxy Music frontman Bryan's youngest son - thankfully appears to be on the mend, with his older brother Otis keeping the family's well-wishers updated about his progress.

Otis has now shared a picture of Merlin taking his first steps since the accident on Twitter.

Merlin can be seen leaning on a crutch for support as he walks down the hospital hallway.

He captioned the image: 'Merlins first steps after a month in QE hospital, Nothing like a delicious curry for motivation! Thank you to all x (sic)'.

Earlier this month, Bryan thanked fans for their kind messages of support after his  son's accident. 

Merlin was trapped in the wreckage of his silver Volvo saloon for almost an hour after the crash, which left his vehicle looking 'like a mangled box of tin'.

A message posted on the former Roxy Music star's Facebook page said: 'On behalf of BF and the family, many thanks for all the kind messages of support for Merlin following his road accident before Christmas.'

It went on: 'Merlin has undergone a series of operations and is now stable in hospital, with a long period of recovery ahead of him.'

The message also thanked the fire and ambulance crews which helped as well as the medical staff at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.

Otis described the wreckage, following the crash on the A458, half a mile to the north west of Cressage, as looking 'like a mangled box of tin'.

One of the other vehicles in the tangled wreck had erupted in flames while Merlin was still trapped in his car, but a passer-by was able to quickly put out the dangerous blaze. 

At the time the West Midlands Ambulance service said he suffered multiple fractures to his legs, pelvis, left arm and had a head injury.

His eldest brother, Eton-educated Otis, informed his followers the day after the crash on December 22 and updated them on his sibling’s condition via his public Instagram page.

After uploading a picture of the crash scene, he said at the time: ‘He had a head-on collision, has lots of broken bones and is having an operation on his heart as we speak. 

‘He was conscious before he went into theatre and his biggest concern was that he had missed Christmas! He is in the best possible hospital for this type of procedure.’

Otis, who is master of the South Shropshire Hunt and has in the past been arrested for his pro-hunting activism, also thanked firefighters for freeing his brother from the wreck.

He wrote on Twitter: ‘Thank you for extracting my brother alive from what looks like a mangled box of tin. We are all continuing to pray.’

Merlin had been travelling along the A458 about half a mile north-west of the village of Cressage, in Shropshire, at the time of the collision.

His car and a red Mercedes, which was travelling in the opposite direction, had collided head-on at around 6.40pm.

The 49-year-old Mercedes driver from Kidderminster escaped with minor injuries.

A third vehicle, a Scania lorry, which was travelling in the same direction as the Mercedes was also involved but little damage was caused to it. The driver was uninjured. 

Merlin, who narrowly escaped jail in 2013 after he was found carrying a knife for a second time, is one of four sons the 69-year-old has with his ex-wife, former model Lucy Helmore.

Their 21-year marriage ended in divorce in 2003 while his second marriage to PR executive Amanda Sheppard, who is 38 years his junior, also ended in divorce earlier this year.

The couple had separated in August last year after being married for two years. 

Merlin had accompanied his siblings Otis, Isaac and Tara to Buckingham Palace three years ago to see their father receive his CBE.
