At least 15 people have died and almost 230 injured after a huge explosion in Taiwan caused by a suspected gas leak.

Multiple explosions happened early on Friday in Kaohsiung city in the south of the island after reported leaks in the sewage system.

Witnesses said the gas leaks started at about 9pm, forming white fog, before fire could be seen and explosions heard on several streets.
