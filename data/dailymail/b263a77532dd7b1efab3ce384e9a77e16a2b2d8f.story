What was supposed to be a moment for Richard Cockerill to revel in Leicester’s famous victory descended into an incredible personal attack as Martin Castrogiovanni launched an expletive-laden outburst against his former boss.

‘Where is the English media? I want to speak to the English media,’ said the long-haired Italian prop as he stormed into the post-game press conference. He then lashed out at Cockerill and slammed the East Midlands club for the way they dealt with his move to Toulon in June 2013.

Castrogiovanni, who made 149 appearances during seven seasons with Leicester, used the vilest epithet to describe the club’s director of rugby following suggestions that he left the club for a pay rise. He also claimed his former employers no longer treat staff with respect.

Martin Castrogiovanni launched an extraordinary personal attack on his former coach Richard Cockerill 

‘I thought f****** Leicester were f****** amateur,’ said Castrogiovanni. ‘He was saying that people go for the money but he has a lot of f****** squad players who get paid as well. I paid my own f****** money to leave this club. I don’t need the money to play rugby. I love this game and I used to love this club.

‘I still love this club but I never want to speak with Cockers any more. I am not fake. If I hate you, if you have been a ****, I will never speak to you again. I don’t hate anyone. Peace and love. I just don’t like ****s.’

The rise of England tighthead Dan Cole effectively ended Castrogiovanni’s tenure as the club’s premier prop. Cole got the better of his former team-mate in Sunday night’s Champions Cup tie and the hosts won an early scrum penalty to take the lead, with promising Welsh youngster Owen Williams kicking 20 points to go with Brad Thorn’s 20th-minute try.

Toulon’s points came through tries from Bryan Habana and Drew Mitchell, with Argentina fly-half Nicolas Sanchez kicking his side into losing bonus point territory. But the significance of the result was overshadowed by Castrogiovanni’s outburst.

‘I never had the opportunity to defend myself when I left,’ added the 33-year-old. ‘Cockers talks about the money, but the real reason I left this club is because you have Cole and you have me. Cole paid gets paid half the money from the RFU and I am foreign. 

'You have a good f****** tighthead prop playing for England and a hairy, fat Italian. The thing is that they made it look like I went for the money but I paid £100,000 from my pocket to leave this club because I want to play rugby. That’s it.

‘I always love this club and I wanted to clarify and talk face to face, which is something Cockers never does. I think in the last few years people are getting sacked and this club was not like that before. They used to respect people, now they act like nothing is going on. That is not from the club, that is from the guys in charge.’

Cockerill had already addressed the media before the outburst but returned and attempted to defuse the situation after Castrogiovanni returned to the changing rooms.

‘I’ve a lot of time for Castro — he’s a fantastic player and icon for this club and a great guy,’ said the Tigers coach. 

‘I always said I would pick on merit and I did. Dan Cole was third choice behind Julian White and Castro and worked hard to become first choice. Castro was released a year early and we agreed a transfer fee with Toulon. I don’t want him to feel bitter towards us. One day we’ll have a beer together and smile about it.’

Leicester fans have complained about alleged abusive comments made by Toulon full-back Delon Armitage. Leicester are likely to investigate the claims this week.
