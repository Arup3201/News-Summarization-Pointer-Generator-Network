Radio 2 listeners know not to expect a lot of subtlety when they tune in to Chris Evans' breakfast show.

But the presenter was especially boastful today, when he took to the skies in the last airworthy Lancaster bomber- making sure he reminded everyone else what they were missing.

Evans said: 'Doing a breakfast show is one of the 
greatest jobs in the world.

'I am so happy to take part in this, every morning
for a living can't believe I actually get paid to have so much fun. 
Especially on days like today. Very proud and lucky'.

The programme marked the 70th 
anniversary of the No.16 squadron returning from the infamous Operation 
Chastise, or Dambusters Raid.

Broadcasting live from RAF Scampton, the former home of the Dambusters, Evans made sure listeners understood the importance of the flight he was taking from Lincoln to Biggin Hill airfield in London. 

The current Squadron leader at RAF Scampton told Evans he hadn't flown in a Lancaster before on the air.

Evans, replied: 'Which is entirely wrong and I do apologise but that's what the brief is and that's what the rules are.'

The DJ said he had been researching the raid in the run up to its anniversary and was 'steeped in Dambusters documentaries'.

He said he had watched the classic film yesterday and called it a 'masterpiece of movie making'.

In a moment of humility, Evans said: 'I am probably one of the least deserving 
people in Britain.

'I apologise to everyone else listening to the 
programme who should be here instead of me.

'But thanks for having me 
anyway.'

Evans used an air raid siren to wake up his listeners during his three-hour breakfast programme.

He said: 'It is never easy to wake up the nation. Something to help him with that. Air raid siren to Wake Up Britain.

In 1943 that Wing Commander Guy 
Gibson trained his squadron for their historic nocturnal assaults on the
Mohne, Eder and Sorpe dams, all crucial to Hitler’s industrial 
heartland in the Ruhr Valley.

Gibson’s force had to fly across 
occupied Europe at night, so low that some were killed by power lines, 
and drop untried bouncing bombs – with unprecedented accuracy – in full 
view of the enemy’s guns.

The Mohne and Eder dams collapsed, German industry was thrown into chaos and the Allies enjoyed a huge boost to morale.

But it was at great cost: eight of Gibson’s 19 planes and 53 of his 133 men were lost.
