Tony Abbott's strong stance with Russia over Malaysian Flight MH17 is believed to have translated into a stronger showing in the polls, making him the preferred prime minister for the first time in four months.

The latest Newspoll published in The Australian shows the Coalition's primary vote is back up to 40 per cent for the first time since April, regaining some of the ground lost after an unpopular budget.

Tony Abbott's tough talking over the investigation into the Malaysian Airlines MH17 tragedy has won him strong support from voters, according to the latest Newspoll

PRIMARY VOTE

Coalition (+4)  40%

ALP         (-2)  34%

Greens    (+1) 13%

Others     (-3)  13%

PREFERRED PM

Tony Abbott     (+3) 41%

Bill Shorten      (-1)  37%

Uncommitted   (-2)  22%

TWO-PARTY PREFERRED

Labor       (-2)  52%

Coalition  (+2) 48%

While there has been some dissatisfaction with the government's new metadata laws, this seems to be tempered by its back-flip in watering down the Racial Discrimination Act.

The poll indicates the Prime Minister's focus on international affairs is the main reason behind him taking back the lead as preferred prime minister over Opposition Leader Bill Shorten.

It also shows his standing as preferred PM has improved by six points since June, while Mr Shorten's has fallen by eight, a 14 point turnaround in favour of the PM.

However, his dissatisfaction rating has also climbed, up one point to 54%

The Coalition's primary vote has risen four points to 40% In the past fortnight but is still 5.6 points lower than its election-winning result of 45.6%.

Labor's primary vote dropped for the second consecutive poll and is down two points to a three-month low of 34.

The Greens gained one point to 13, while independents and other parties dropped from 16 to 13.
