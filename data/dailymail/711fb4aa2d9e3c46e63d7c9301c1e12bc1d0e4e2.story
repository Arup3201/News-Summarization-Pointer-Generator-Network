The bargain boasts of teleshopping TV presenters are to be investigated after a string of bogus claims were exposed.

TV regulator Ofcom has launched an inquiry after 27 complaints were upheld against Bid TV and Price Drop TV.

Misinformation about the true value of everything from fleeces to precious stones and gold-dipped jewellery are under the spotlight.

Inaccurate descriptions about products, including Swish watches which are actually made in China, will also be investigated.

The inquiry has been triggered by the 
Advertising Standards Authority, which said the company behind the two 
channels – Sit-Up Ltd – has failed to put a stop to the misleading 
claims.

Where the ASA has no power to act against the TV firm, Ofcom has the ability to pull it off air.

The channels specialise in presenting products which start off at a high headline price and are then gradually reduced in the hope viewers will be tempted to buy. In an attempt to create the excitement of the auction room, presenters make flowery and, sometimes outlandish, claims about the products and their value.

However, the ASA found on many 
occasions, the true value of the item under the hammer appears to have 
been exaggerated in order to convince buyers they are getting a big 
saving. The list of presenters employed by Bid TV includes people with a
background in drama and dance.

In December, Bid TV promoted a set of 
three ‘Granite Outdoor Fleeces’ at a price of £19.99, falling to £16.99.
One viewer complained the same items were being sold for just £4.99 
elsewhere.

The ASA said: ‘Since January 2012 
there have been 27 ASA rulings against Sit-Up Ltd. We are concerned that
that number of misleading ads creates an on-going and cumulative risk 
of financial detriment to consumers.’

The TV company said it was disappointed at the Ofcom inquiry.

It said: ‘We have made significant and continuous efforts to improve our compliance performance and procedures.’
