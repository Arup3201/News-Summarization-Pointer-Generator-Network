A lawyer has shot himself dead just weeks after his mother was found murdered in her bed and 15 months after he witnessed his father's 'accidental' death while they took a hiking trip.

John Conrad Wagner, 32, was found dead in his apartment in Philadelphia as police began homing in on him as a suspect in the shooting death of his mother, Carolyn, in December.

In light of the deaths, questions have been raised about the veracity of Wagner's story that his father slipped while taking photos on a trip to the Mount Rainier National Park in Washington in 2011.

Authorities now believe the younger 
Wagner killed his mother due to the financial pressures of hefty 
students loans, which he believed would take him 20 years to pay back.

Before tragedy: John Wagner is pictured with his mother Carolyn last Christmas, just days before police believe he killed her. As police were about to arrest him, Wagner shot himself dead

By killing his mother, 64, he could have hoped to inherit her assets and bank accounts, police said. But when his body was found in his Pine Street home on January 31, there was no note to confirm the motive.

'We'll never know his motive,' Marion County Sheriff's Capt. Robert Sandlin told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'What is our opinion? 
Financial. He had a lot of student loans that were outstanding.'

After Wagner graduated from Florida State University, he went on to achieve a law degree from Villanova, and stayed in Philadelphia, where he struggled to get a job.

He eventually landed work overlooking
 claims for firms representing pharmaceutical companies, and his 
colleagues told the Daily News that he was a well-liked, upbeat member of 
the team.

Mystery: His father, Roger Wagner, slipped to his death while on a hiking trip with John in 2011

But he also struggled with his student debt, which kept him from his dreams of having a family.

'Carolyn was hopeful that he would get 
married, settle down and get a permanent job,' Batsch said. 'It's just that
 he had some student-loan debt that was heavy. It was taking up a lot of
 his salary. He just felt like he couldn't.'

Happier times: Carolyn was left with unanswered questions about her husband's death, friends said

In September 2011, he took a trip with his father, Roger Wagner, 59, when tragedy struck.

John later told authorities that he and his father were walking along a trail at the top of a canon when his father stopped to take pictures and slipped, plunging 40 ft into a stream below.

John Wagner said he'd not seen the accident but heard his screams as he had fell.

The accident happened at dusk and authorities were only able to begin rescue efforts the next day, when Roger's body was found downstream from a massive waterfall. It was ruled an accidental death.

After his father's death, he refused 
to talk about it and his grieving mother, who lived in Ocala, Florida, 
was left without answers, her friends told the Daily News.

'It did bother her,' friend Patty Batsch said. 'I think she did have 
questions. She said when the time is right she was going 
to try and talk to him about it.'

Then last December, Wagner drove to his mother's home in Florida for Christmas. But days later, neighbours Amin and Sally Khan noticed that they hadn't seen Carolyn for a while.

They
 went to her home and found her body in her bed. She had been shot 
multiple times and her purse, phone and wedding rings were gone.

Florida police determined John Wagner had been the last person to see his mother alive, so pulled him in for questioning.

He
 told officers he had never owned a gun but when he returned to 
Philadelphia, he reported to city police that a 9 mm Ruger handgun he 
owned had been stolen from his house, Sandlin said.

The shell casings at the scene of her killing were consistent with bullets fired from a 9 mm Ruger.

Detectives from Florida also executed a search warrant on his home, and found he had searched for 'who did the shooting' and information on guns and forensics on his computer, police said.

With evidence mounting against him, police went to arrest him and conduct another search of his home on January 31. But instead they found him dead from a gunshot wound.

Police said the cases of all three deaths are closed, yet friends said there are still many unanswered questions about what part, if any, he had in his fathers death and why he killed his mother.

'Law school isn't worth killing your 
mother over,' said Khan, the neighbour. 'Whatever the motive was, nobody will ever 
know, because only he knows what made him do it.'
