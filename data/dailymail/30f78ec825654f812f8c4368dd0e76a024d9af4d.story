The writer who was working with Julian Assange's failed 2011 autobiography has for the first time described what it was like collaborating with the WikiLeaks founder who he found by turns inconsistent, passionate, funny, lazy, courageous, vain, paranoid, moral and manipulative.

Andrew O'Hagan, an award-winning, Booker-nominated writer, was drafted in by publishers Canongate to ghost-write but as the deadline loomed Assange was increasingly uncomfortable about the whole venture and one of the highest profile book deals of recent times collapsed.   

Canongate had sold books in more than 40 countries for a staggering US$2.5m before the deal imploded.

Complex: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, whose behaviour O'Hagan sheds light on

O'Hagan told his story in a lengthy essay for the London Review of Books, a version of which he delivered in a lecture in London last night, the Guardian reported.

Ultimately, the book deal collapsed, O'Hagan wrote, because Assange had never wanted to write it. 

'The man who put himself in charge of disclosing the world's secrets simply couldn't bear his own. The story of his life mortified him and sent him scurrying for excuses. He didn't want to do the book. He hadn't from the beginning,' he said. 

As the deadline approached, Assange was 'totally shocked' at the idea of his story being told, and he branded people who write about their family as 'prostitutes'.

His lawyers had persuaded him to publish it, arguing that the royalties would help with his rising legal bill. Assange was initially enthusiastic, and told O'Hagan he hoped the book would read 'like Hemingway'. 

'Mansion arrest': the Norfolk stately home where Assange and some of his supporters lived for a time. He later felt the Guardian had gone from a collaborator to an enemy

Canongate, fed up with Assange 
increasingly not co-operating, published a version of O'Hagan's 
manuscript, Julian Assange: The Unauthorised Biography in September 
2011. 

Assange had not given his consent. But this did not stop him covertly encouraging sales and tweeting links to its Amazon page. 

To no avail. The book sold fewer than 700 copies in its first week - a disaster. 

In
 his essay, O'Hagan also shed light on Assange's unconventional life at 
Ellingham Hall in Norfolk before he sought refuge in the Ecuadorean 
Embassy. 

He lived there 
with a group of supporters while on bail over allegations of rape and 
sexual assault in Sweden under conditions candidly described by one of 
his lawyers as jokingly referred to as 'mansion arrest'.

Endorsement: Fidel Castro, pictured here with his brother and successor Raul (right), and Venezuela's late president Hugo Chavez, said apparently told Assange that WikiLeaks was the only website he liked

On his first visit to the country 
house, O'Hagan was met by Assange in stockinged feet. Assange that him 
he might be in jail soon and that might not be bad for writing the book.

Prestige: Canongate assigned O'Hagan, whose 1999 book Our Fathers was shortlisted for the Booker Prize

O'Hagan
 said that during the Egyptian uprising, when President Hosni Mubarak 
tried to close the country's phone network Assange and other staffers 
hacking into the system from their Norfolk kitchen table to reverse the 
shutdown, then leant back to eat chocolates as the revolution 
continued.

O'Hagan was told that Former Cuban President Fidel Castro had sent a message to say WikiLeaks was the only website he liked.

Assange
 was at times paranoid, O'Hagan said, citing the whistle-blower's fears 
that when driving through Norfolk he was being followed by would-be 
assassins. 

When a group of company presidents offered Assange £20,000 for an hour's Skype time, he said: 'If Tony Blair - a war criminal - can get £120,000, I should get at least £1 more than him.

The Australian had strong views on former collaborators who in his view had become 'enemies' - the Guardian, the New York Times, in time, Canongate. 

In his view 'the Guardian was an enemy because he'd 'given' them something and they hadn't toed the line, whereas the Daily Mail was almost respected for finding him entirely abominable.'

O'Hagan described feeling torn betwen 'a kind of loyalty to Julian's vulnerability, especially (not in spite of) his role as enemy to himself', and regarding him as a Peter Pan-type figure, 'the lost boy of Queensland with his silver hair and his sense that the world of adults is no real place for him'.
