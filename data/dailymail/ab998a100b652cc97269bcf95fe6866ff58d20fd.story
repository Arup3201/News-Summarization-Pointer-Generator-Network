For more than 80 years, the Aga cooker has been the heart of thousands of quintessentially British homes.

Permanently on and warming the kitchen, it has brought comfort and joy to those who swear by its traditional simplicity and old-style charm.

But now the Aga has been thrust into the digital age with the launch of a model which can be turned on and off with a text message.

The new cooker contains a SIM card and can be activated via text message - with users receiving a confirmation saying 'Roasting Oven Activated'

On sale from this Friday, the AGA 
iTotal Control will set you back £10,090. It has three ovens – for 
roasting, baking and simmering – all of which can be operated remotely.

It is a development of the £9,895 AGA
 Total Control cooker, which was the first electric Aga that could be 
switched on and off as the user required. Traditional Agas – which are 
on all the time, guzzle up to 40 litres of oil a week and pump carbon 
dioxide into the air – have been criticised for being environmentally 
unfriendly.

Modern Agas are programmable and reach cooking temperature only when you need them.

The new model receives commands via a
 standard mobile phone SIM card inserted into a small box, similar to a 
broadband router, which is connected to the cooker by a cable.

Cyber-stove: PC users can also log in to a dedicated website to turn on any of the three ovens from afar - the oven connects to your home wi-fi network, so you don't need to run wiring through the kitchen

Once the cooker is installed, you 
save its unique phone number into your mobile and when you wish to 
operate it remotely you text one of the following commands: roasting 
oven on; baking oven on; simmering oven on; all ovens on; all zones off.

Once the text has been sent you receive a reply saying, for example, ‘roasting oven on activated’.

The Aga can also be operated via an 
app which can be downloaded to smartphones from Apple’s app store or the
 Android Marketplace.

Owners can also register on a dedicated website which allows them to control the oven from a laptop.

The makers yesterday hailed it as their response to ‘things getting decidedly more techie in the kitchen’ these days.

‘You can ensure the cooker is warm 
and supper will be cooked at exactly the time you need it – wherever you
 are in the world,’ said a spokesman.

But not all Aga lovers are simmering with excitement at the new model.

Best-selling author Jilly Cooper, 75,
 speaking from her home in Gloucestershire, said: ‘I don’t believe it – 
it’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard. I love my Aga to bits, but I 
can’t even text on the phone.

‘Oh bless it, will I have to learn to text now? Maybe something like this will drag me into the 21st century at last.’

Miss Cooper, who is writing her latest
 novel about flat-racing, added: ‘Agas are heaven. The wonderful thing 
about mine is that it’s always on and I can leave it on overnight and 
slow-cook stews for my dogs for the morning.’

The new model has a built-in SIM card but can also be controlled via apps on iPads and smartphones
