The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating reports that someone pointed a laser light at the cockpits of two airplanes in the Boston area.

Also, police in Newton, just west of Boston and the Logan Airport, are looking into a report from a driver that a man pointed a green laser at him and other drivers on Tuesday night, about two hours before the planes were allegedly targeted.

One plane had left Boston and was heading to Atlanta; the other was en route to Boston and flying to Providence, Rhode Island.

Blinding: The FAA demonstrated the power of a laser pointer's beam when aimed at the cockpit of an airliner in a training video

The FAA pinpointed the coordinates to Forte Park in Newton, and police responded but did not find anyone.

Police do not know if the incidents are related.

While shining laser beams at planes won't cause any structural damage it could potentially blind pilots.

No lasers have caused any plane crashes, but the number of reported incidents, similar to last night's, has drastically increased over the past several years.

Growing problem: Laser beam attacks are on the rise across the United States. In 2006, just 384 were reported but that number rose to 3,900 by 2013 (file photo)

Shining a laser pointer into the cockpit of an aircraft is a felony.

A few years ago, the Senate actually passed an amendment to make it a federal crime, that could serve offenders with a $250,000 fine and and put them behind bars for up to five years.

Officials are so determined to crack down on the amount of laser incidents, the FBI has said it will pay $10,000 for information leading to a conviction in 11 cities, but that does not include Boston.
