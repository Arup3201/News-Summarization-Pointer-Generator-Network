David Cameron has often railed against big firms moving abroad to avoid tax, warning they must 'wake up and smell the coffee' to recognise public anger at the practice.

So there must have been an awkward conversation over the Number 10 breakfast table this morning after it emerged the Prime Minister's wife Samantha works for a company which is now based in a tax haven.

Luxury leather goods firm Smythson, where Mrs Cameron is a creative consultant, is owned through a holding company in Luxembourg and linked to a secretive trust in the Channel Island of Guernsey, another well-known tax haven.

Mrs Cameron has been a creative consultant at the upmarket company since 2010 on a salary thought to be up to £100,000 a year 

Details of Smythson's financial affairs are likely to be the source of embarrassment for Mr Cameron, who has warned customers are fed up with the perception that companies do not pay their fair share.

Two years ago he took a swipe at coffee chain Starbucks, following revelations it had failed to pay corporation tax in the UK for three years. 

The Prime Minister insisted individuals and businesses 'must pay their fair share'. 

‘Any businesses who think that they can carry on dodging that fair share or that they can keep on selling to the UK and setting up ever-more complex tax arrangements abroad to squeeze their tax bill right down - well, they need to wake up and smell the coffee because the public who buy from them have had enough,' he said in January 2013. 

Chancellor George Osborne unveiled a so-called ‘Google Tax’ in his recent Autumn Statement, aimed at curbing tax avoidance and stopping multi-national tech companies from channelling revenues into secretive tax havens.

Smythson is owned and run by secretive Egypt-born Frenchman Jacques Bahbout, who bought the group for £18m in 2009 through his Italian handbag manufacturer Tivoli Group. Smythson pays several million pounds a year for Tivoli’s goods and services.

Bahbout is also looking at selling a stake in the business this year to raise money to expand.

Since Bahbout bought the business, the holding company Holdsmyth has paid around £1.06m in corporation tax.

But £1m in dividends paid out since Bahbout bought the group may have benefited from the tax status of Guernsey and Luxembourg.

Controversy over its tax affairs is likely to intensify as the company has also benefited from taxpayer-backed low-cost loans. The company previously borrowed £2m under the National Loan Guarantee Scheme, a Government initiative for the banks to provide small firms with cheap finance, and currently has a £5m credit facility which is classed as ‘state aid’.

Mrs Cameron was previously creative director of the brand until 2010. She took home about £30,000 as a bonus when it was sold.

The Prime Minister’s press office said it had no comment to make on the company or its tax situation.

Details in the firm’s annual accounts filed at Companies House show Holdsmyth is owned by ‘a company incorporated in Luxembourg’ and is ultimately controlled by ‘Ogier Trustee (Jersey) Ltd as trustees of the Barracuda Trust, a trust settled in Guernsey’.

The company did not comment on its ownership structure but a spokesman said that it has ‘ambitious’ expansion plans for the next two years.
