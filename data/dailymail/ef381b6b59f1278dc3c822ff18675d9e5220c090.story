Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba is set to make his debut for new club Besiktas in the unlikely surroundings of Macclesfield Town’s Moss Rose ground on Wednesday night.

Ba, who completed his £8million signing in Istanbul last week, has returned immediately to England to join up with his team-mates on pre-season tour.

The 29-year-old Senegal star is likely to play for Besiktas against German club Mainz as manager ex-West Ham and Everton player Slaven Bilic prepares for their Champions League third qualifying round tie against Feyenoord.

Macclesfield’s pitch has a good reputation which is why two European teams have chosen it as a venue but the Conference club’s stadium with its capacity of 6,355 will represent a change for Ba who effectively decided the Premier League title race last season.

His goal for Chelsea against Liverpool at Anfield following a slip by Steve Gerrard allowed eventual champions Manchester City to have the destiny of the title race back in their own hands.

Ba will be the latest example of famous football players and managers having low-key debuts.

Hitman: Ba scored 87 goals in three years at West Ham, Newcastle United and Chelsea

The first £1million footballer Trevor Francis was ordered by his Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough to make his debut for the ‘A’ team against Notts County in the Midland Intermediate League.

David Beckham’s Manchester United career started with a subsitute’s appearance in a League Cup tie at Brighton while David Moyes’ ill-fated reign as United manager last year began inauspiciously with a 1-0 defeat against the Singha All-Stars in Bangkok, Thailand.

Ba scored 87 goals in three years at West Ham, Newcastle United and Chelsea but was deemed surplus to requirements by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho following his purchase of £32million Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa.
