The buyer of a castle built by a swashbuckling pirate might stumble across enough hidden treasure to make Captain Jack Sparrow go weak at the knees.

Legend has it that its owner Captain Bell stashed his loot in the castle cellars.

Now Grade II-listed Bell’s Castle, in the Cotswolds, is set to fill another treasure chest – and it could fetch over £2.5million.

The 19th century castle nestled in the picturesque rolling hills of the Cotswolds was built by pirate Captain Bell 200 years ago

The Gothic castle could fetch £2.5million after it was put up for sale by the current owners - a fourth generation of the Holland-Martin family

The Grade II listed Bell's Castle has seven bedrooms and four bathrooms in its main building and also boasts a swimming pool and tennis court within its grounds

Complete with brooding battlements and turrets, it’s set in the Overbury Estate and links a row of early 17th century cottages to an 18th century lookout tower.

A bold buccaneer of the Napoleonic Wars, Captain Bell was renowned for his daring raids on ships laden with gold and other treasure.

The present owners, the Holland-Martins, are the fourth generation of the same family to have lived in the castle since the latter part of the 19th century.

A spokesman for Savills’, which is marketing the property, said: ‘Bell’s Castle, besides its fascinating history and architecture, is first and foremost a wonderful family home.'

One of the many cosy living areas inside the 200-year-old castle, which is based in large grounds within the Overbury Estate - known for its partridge and pheasant shoot

The picturesque scene starts from the minute the front door is opened and  is a short drive from the world-famous polo at Cirencester Park, often visited by the Royal Family

He built and owned the majestic Bell's Castle but how did Captain Bell manage to swag such a hefty plunder?

The pirate was said to have 'spoiled merchant ships of cargoes of silks, wines and gold and had the loot conveyed from the Bristol Channel up the Severn and Avon rivers to Bredon Hill, and thence by pack horses to Bell’s Castle there to be hidden in cavernous cellars.'So long as the Napoleonic war lasted, the authorities treated Captain Bell as a national hero.But when he continued his piratical habits in peacetime, they could no longer turn a blind eye to his exploits, especially when he was said to have captured two beautiful French Countesses, locking them in the castle and holding them for ransom.Eventually he paid the penalty on the hangman’s scaffold.

Captain Bell was treated as a national hero throughout the Napoleonic War, but when he continued his piratical habits in the peacetime, the authorities had him hanged

The castle passed into the ownership of the Overbury Estate and the Holland-Martin family in the 19th century, who have recently decided to put it up for sale

The Gothic
 fortress boasts seven bedrooms and four bathrooms in the main castle 
and a two-bed cottage, swimming pool, tennis court and large grounds.

In the late 19th century the castle passed into the ownership of the Overbury Estate and the Holland-Martin family.

Ben Holland-Martin is the fourth-generation of the family to own Bell's Castle - his father was Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin, Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces in Malta

In the early 20th century Robert Holland-Martin’s six sons would often camp in the castle grounds.Once they managed to take a pony into the castle and manhandled it to the upper-most tower, and on another occasion one of the boys, Deric, was unceremoniously tied to a selection of umbrellas and pushed from the top tower to parachute to the ground many feet below.  Fortunately he survived, became Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin, serving as Lord Lieutenant of the county, and was Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces in Malta, and with his wife Rosamund, who was chairman of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) for nearly two decades, lived at Bell’s Castle from the 1950s.One of his sons, Ben who followed in his mother's footsteps and works for the children's charity, is the fourth generation of the Holland-Martin family to own Bell’s Castle, which has now been put on the market.
