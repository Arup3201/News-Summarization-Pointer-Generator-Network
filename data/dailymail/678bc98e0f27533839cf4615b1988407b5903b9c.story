A millionaire couple claim their parties in the celebrity-filled suburb of Primrose Hill - which have caused six council noise complaints - are simply a case of 'middle-aged ravers getting out of control'.

Irate neighbours have lodged noise complaints with Camden Council after Erin and Jeremy Morris, who run the upmarket jewellers David Morris, hosted a series of loud parties over the past 12 months at their £5.2million home.

Primrose Hill, where houses regularly sell for tens of million of pounds, is an area which has long been popular with the rich and famous.

Those who live or own homes in the area include Labour leader Ed Miliband, media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth, singer Gwen Stefani and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.

And the house belonging to the Morrises was the childhood home of London Mayor Boris Johnson before it was sold by his parents.

The Morris' recent parties have been so loud Channel 5 presenter and neighbour Matthew Wright has claimed he is forced to wear ear plugs when going to sleep.

Despite this, Mrs Morris has defended their actions.

She said the couple were middle-aged so it was nice to have friends visit them at home, rather than going to a club, the Evening Standard reported.

She said: 'We have a really big family and we have lots of friends and maybe had too many glasses of wine and didn't realise the level of the bass.

'I think it was a case of middle-aged ravers getting out of control.'

When contacted by MailOnline, a spokesperson for Mr and Mrs Morris said they had no further comment to make.

Last month Mr Wright publicly stated his disappointment with a new wave of residents in Primrose Hill who he claimed showed less regard for their neighbours.

Chef Jamie Oliver (who has not complained about the parties) is also believed to own a home in the area

He told the Daily Express: 'I'm three gardens down with double glazing and I can't sleep with earplugs in.'

'I don't remember anyone holding parties mid-week with bouncers when I first moved here.

'Now there's one every other week and it seems owners of bigger houses are the worst offenders.'

The issue of noisy parties in the celebrity-filled suburb appears to be becoming a long-term problem.

In December, Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth and her husband Matthew Freud were told to keep the noise down after a noisy bash at their £24million home - which was reportedly attended by celebrities such as Russell Brand, Jemima Khan, Justin Timberlake and Samuel L. Jackson.

At the time, a neighbour said: ‘It used to be a quiet area but it’s become like little Beverly Hills. They should at the very least let the neighbours know when the parties are going to be held and agree a finishing time.’

Mr Freud later apologised to anyone disturbed by the parties.

He said: ‘We are genuinely sorry to hear that some of our neighbours were disturbed by guests leaving our family home on a couple of occasions earlier this year. We love Primrose Hill and would never wish to inconvenience any of our fellow residents.

‘We have a young family ourselves and these were irregular events. Our apologies go to anyone who was disturbed on those evenings.'
