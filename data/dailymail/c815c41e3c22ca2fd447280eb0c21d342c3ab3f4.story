Plenty of women would love to find a perfume that knocks their husband off his feet. But Carrie Parry is desperate for one that doesn’t.

A mere whiff of her Chanel No 5 is enough to make husband Glynn fall to the ground – and the consequences can be severe.

The father of three suffers from a rare condition that causes him to collapse if he comes into contact with certain triggers.

Glynn Parry suffers from an extremely rare condition that causes him to collapse if he comes into contact with certain triggers, such as his wife Carrie's perfume

Trigger: Mr Parry says his wife once wore Chanel No 5 and he collapsed just seconds later

Mr Parry, 36, said: ‘Some sufferers react to chocolate or cheese but one of my strangest and strongest triggers is Chanel No 5.

‘My wife wore it once and I immediately collapsed – I just went within a space of a few seconds. It was a very severe reaction.

‘It may seem like a joke, being 
knocked out by a perfume, but it  is not fun. Obviously Chanel No  5 
contains a specific mix to  which I am very susceptible.’ Mr Parry 
suffers from familial hemiplegic migraines, a genetic condition 
affecting neurotransmitters  in the brain.

In an attack, one hemisphere of the 
brain temporarily shuts down, leading to paralysis. It can happen at any
 time and can be triggered by anything from sunlight and stress to 
alcohol and aromas.

Mr Parry suffered his first attack when he was just 14 and they have worsened as he has got older.

‘If I’m lucky, I get a warning and see blurred lights and then self-preservation kicks in,’ he said.

‘I try to find a bench, a chair or a 
bed to land on and lie down on, because I know I’ve got a matter of 
minutes before I collapse.

‘It leaves me completely paralysed 
down my left side and the attack can be so bad I can’t move a muscle, I 
can’t even blink.’ Mr Parry has to stay away from direct sunlight, 
temperature changes, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol and certain foods, and
 said his 33-year-old wife has also been forced to avoid perfumes, 
deodorants or strong-smelling soaps.

He said: ‘It is very frustrating for 
her not being able to do some things like wear nice perfume and I am 
very conscious of the restrictions it places on her.

‘She’s my primary carer and for that I am enormously grateful. She has to put up with an awful lot.’

Due to the increasing severity of the 
attacks, Mr Parry is now unable to work. He said: ‘When I was younger I 
would get over it in a day, but now it is taking much longer to 
recover.’

The former financial sector worker, 
from Coedpoeth, near Wrexham, Wales, added that one of the most 
frustrating issues is people not recognising his condition and simply 
assuming he is drunk if he collapses.

His wife is now a full-time carer for 
her husband and their three children – six-year-old Logan, who has a 
form of autism, Ffion, four, and three-year-old Sophia.

She said: ‘On one occasion his 
employer range me up after he suffered an attack in work and said: “Will
 you pick your husband up? He’s drunk.”

‘I said: “‘No, he isn’t, he’s got a medical condition” but people just don’t understand.’

‘The worry is that this could be life-threatening or that he might not quite recover from an attack. We have to be careful.’
