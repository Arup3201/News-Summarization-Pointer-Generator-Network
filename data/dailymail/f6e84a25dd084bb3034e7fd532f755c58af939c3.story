A cash-strapped football club threw out antique oak chairs worth a  fortune because its former Russian owner wanted a minimalistic look.

The 14 chairs and a table from one of  Britain’s greatest warships were found in a skip seven years ago.

The furniture was made for HMS Warrior, the world’s first iron-hulled warship, and later donated by the Royal Navy to Portsmouth FC.

On TV: A builder took the chairs he found in a skip onto Antiques Roadshow and learnt they were valuable antiques worth thousands

Beleaguered: Portsmouth Football Club, based at Fratton Park ground, has weathered many cash crises

But in 2006, the historic items were cast off by the Russian owner of the then struggling Premier League club in favour of modern furniture. They were found by a builder in a skip.

He kept them in storage with a view to one day returning them to the south coast club.

The unnamed builder took the furniture to the Antiques Roadshow when it visited Portsmouth and they are now set to feature on this Sunday’s show.

The chairs have the design of a ship’s wheel on the back and are likely to have been made for a ward room on HMS Warrior, which was built in the 1860s.

They have been owned by Portsmouth FC for more than 70 years but during the Second World War, they were moved to a harbour fort, where Winston Churchill and Field Marshal Montgomery are said to have sat on them to plot the downfall of the Germans.

Russian billionaire Alexandre Gaydamak bought the struggling football club in 2006 and decided to give the boardroom a makeover.

The builder told Antiques Roadshow 
expert Deborah Lambert: ‘Portsmouth Football Club were taken over by a 
new owner and decided to modernise the interior of the stadium.

Owner: When Alexandre Gayamak, left, bought the 
club the chairs, seen with expert Deborah Lambert, were put into a skip 
but were saved and have been kept in storage for the last seven years

‘My company actually carried out the works, and to my horror, these – and a table – were literally in the skip.

‘There are 14 chairs and I believe it’s a five-leafed table, which I’ve kept in storage for the last seven years.

‘I believe it [the furniture] was donated by one of the authorities within the Navy, because it was originally on HMS Warrior.’

Miss Lambert said the chairs – which were worth ‘thousands of pounds’ – dated to the mid 19th-century.

She said: ‘I would say that these chairs
date from around 1860-1870. They’re made of oak, and are a very 
characteristic kind of yellowish colour that you find in the 19th 
century.

Historic: Built at a cost of £377,000 in 1860, HMS Warrior was Britain's first armour-plated, iron-hulled ship

‘Stylistically they certainly fit with the period of HMS Warrior, which was commissioned in 1861.’

The builder said he hoped to give the valuable furniture back to the club when the current owners had ‘changed their taste’.

HMS Warrior was built for the Royal Navy in 1859-61.

She and her sister ship Black Prince were the first armour-plated, iron-hulled warships, and were built in response to France’s launching in 1859 of the first ocean-going ironclad warship, the wooden-hulled Gloire.

HMS Warrior became obsolete after the 1871 launching of the mastless and more capable Devastation.

She served as a storeship and depot ship, and in 1904 was assigned to the Royal Navy’s torpedo training school.

In 1979, the ship was donated to the Maritime Trust. After it was restored, it returned to Portsmouth as a museum ship.

Troubles: Portsmouth FC has had more than its fair share of financial troubles

Known as Pompey, Portsmouth 
Football Club is much loved by its fans who have accompanied it through 
every up and down of the club's history.

And there have been plenty of them since it was founded in 1898.

As far back as 1976, the club found itself in danger of bankruptcy and so had to sell off players to keep afloat.

As
their fortunes waned, so too did their luck, and Pompey went from the 
Second Division to the Fourth Division and up to the First Division in 
1986-87.

By the following 
season they were in financial trouble again and were relegated back to 
the Second Division, and less than 10 years later Terry Venables was 
able to buy the club for £1.

In
1998 the club went into administration, a century after it was founded,
but was rescued by a rich new Serbian owner Milan Mandaric.

Gaydamak
bought the club in 2006 and pumped large amounts of cash into it, and 
in 2008 they won the FA Cup.  However since then the club has had to go 
into administration twice.

In April this year it was bought by the Pompey Supporters Trust, which enabled it to exit administration.
