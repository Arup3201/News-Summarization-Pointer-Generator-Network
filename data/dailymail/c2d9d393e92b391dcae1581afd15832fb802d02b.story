Last week, she declared herself 'humbled' by the bravery of Colombia's rape victims and signalled her determination to do more to raise awareness of the problem in the UK. 

Now, the Duchess of Cornwall has spoken out on behalf of sex-trafficking survivors in Mexico and said she was 'moved' after hearing the stories of a brave group of women.

The Duchess, who is currently touring Mexico with Prince Charles, met the women during a visit to a safe house in Mexico City.

Tragedy: Carla (far right) was sold into prostitution by her boyfriend when she was just 12 years old

Passion: The Duchess of Cornwall is a long-standing supporter of charities that help rape victims

Visit: The Duchess was visiting the Fundacion Camino A Casa which has rescued 169 girls since 2008

The Fundacion Camino A Casa (The Road Home) provides shelter and rehabilitation for underage victims of the sex trade and has rescued 169 girls since 2008.

During a tour of the facilities, Camilla met Madai and Carla, both of whom had been sold into prostitution by their respective boyfriends.

Carla was only 12 years old when she was sold into prostitution, forced to take drugs, beaten and burned. A client helped her to escape when she was 16 and now she has a two-year-old daughter.

Speaking through an interpreter, the Duchess said: 'Please tell them how touched I am by their stories. I am very humbled.

Painful memories: Madai, seen with the Duchess of Cornwall, was also sold into prostitution by a boyfriend

Tea and sympathy: The Duchess heard victim's stories while taking tea with them at the shelter

Passionate: Last week in Colombia, Camilla vowed to speak up on behalf of rape victims everywhere

'It's very moving to hear a story like that and it shows what can be done. With more people like these two you can make a huge difference.'

Carla showed Camilla her 'book of dreams' which included the front cover of a Forbes 50 most powerful women in Mexico.

'I have no doubt that she will succeed whatever she does,' added a clearly moved Camilla. 'I feel the book will have a very happy ending.'

The safe house visit in Mexico comes after the Duchess attended a meeting on ending sexual violence in Colombia, last week. 

Camilla has also visited to Rape Crisis centres and Sexual Assault Referral Centres across the UK and is a passionate supporter of victim's groups.

In February 2013, she hosted a reception for charities and other organisations involved in supporting victims of rape and sexual abuse.

During the visit to the shelter in Mexico, Camilla also met girls who are living there as well as staff and volunteers.

Meeting: After visiting the refuge, Camilla joined Prince Charles to meet President Enrique Peña Nieto

Talks: Prince Charles and President Peña Nieto held talks on boosting the UK's links with Mexico

Big news: The visit, which diplomats hope will boost trade, comes ahead of 2015's Year of the UK in Mexico

According to Mexico's National Commission of Human Rights, in terms of economic gain, human trafficking is the second largest area of criminal activity in Mexico, after drugs trafficking.

The National Institute of Geography and Statistics reports that some 10 million Mexicans have been victims of some kind of human trafficking - 79 per cent for sexual exploitation.

Colombia has similarly grim figures, with an estimated 500,000 women raped between 2001 and 2009 - equivalent to one every 15 minutes.

In the UK, an estimated 85,000 women are raped each year according to charity Rape Crisis, while more than 400,000 suffer some form of sexual assault.

Links: Prince Charles, who had narrowly missed a dunking during an earlier visit, also made a speech

The Prince of Wales almost found himself taking an early bath yesterday, after visiting a floating farm in a rickety-looking boat.

Charles has long been passionate about organic farming - of which Mexico's floating farms are a stellar example - but reaching them meant standing precariously in a flat bottomed boat for a journey up an irrigation canal.

Happily for the heir to the throne, the boat proved sturdier than it looked and Charles made it back to Mexico City for the formal welcome without getting a dunking.

During the meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto at the National Palace, the pair were presented with a set of miniature artworks, and gave the president a set of decorated Highgrove plates in return.

Later, Charles and President Pena Nieto launched an initiative aimed at forging stronger links between their two nations - The Year of the UK in Mexico 2015.

In a speech, the Prince said: 'Today, the ties that bind the British and Mexican people are stronger than ever.

'Whether in business, government, education, science, sport, culture, trade, in fighting international crime, promoting human rights, or protecting the urban and natural environment, I am struck by the fascination that we hold for each others’ cultures - and by the energy and goodwill that are generated when we work together.

'I could not be more pleased, therefore, to join with you on this occasion in order to celebrate the fact that this already excellent relationship will be further enhanced over the course of 2015 through both The Year of the UK in Mexico and The Year of Mexico in the UK.'

Close relationship: Prince Charles said he 'could not be more pleased' to be in Mexico

Common ground: In his speech, Charles said the UK and Mexico shared common ground on many issues

Fascination: Prince Charles also told his hosts that the UK and Mexico had a 'fascination' with each other

Escape: Earlier, Prince Charles had narrowly avoided an early bath during a tour of Mexico's floating farms
