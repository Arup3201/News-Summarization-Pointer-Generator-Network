A closeted gay student living in West Monroe, Louisiana has written a powerful essay, criticizing the town's most famous residents - Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson.

Robertson made headlines after issuing homophobic comments in a GQ article, at one point comparing gay sex to bestiality, which got him put on suspension by the A&E network. But the network announced yesterday that they would be reinstating Robertson to the show, who so far has remained unapologetic about the comments.

In an essay posted on Times-Picuyne columnist Robert Mann's blog, the communications student writes that Robertson probably didn't mean to hurt anyone with his statements, he nonetheless created a hostile environment.

'He
 encouraged - hopefully unintentionally - a two-week-long "fag bashing" 
in Monroe and around the world. He made me feel unsafe in my own home. I
 can't count how many times I heard "faggot" over the Christmas visit 
home.'

Hurtful words: A closeted gay student has come out to condemn Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson over his homophobic comments

The author says he's never met Robertson but was raised by a man just like him, revealing that his father called him an asshole for coming out to his mother and told him that his boyfriend would never be welcomed at his house.

'My Phil Robertson threatened my life because I had the audacity to be who I am,' he wrote.

Like many southerners, the writer grew up in a religious family and always felt a deep connection to the Christian church.

But when then he realized that people like Robertson believed he had a 'second class soul' and wouldn't be eligible for salvation because of who he loved.

Not accepted: In an anonymous essay posted on a Times-Picayune columnist's blog, the student writes about what its like to grow up and live in the same community as Robertson (far right) - surrounded by people who don't accept gays

He says the church gets closer to welcoming gay members every year but something always happens to bring back the worst in people.

'One year it was Chick-fil-a. This year it's Phil Robertson.'

Worse than not being accepted by his church is not being accepted by his own family. He says he came out to his parents but was told to keep it a secret from everyone they know: 'The family isn't ready to hear that,' they said.

People like Sarah Palin have come out to defend Robertson, saying he shouldn't be persecuted for his beliefs but the writer points out a flaw with this reasoning.

Back in the game: Robertson's views briefly got him suspended from the network but that ban was officially lifted yesterday and he will appear in future episodes of Duck Dynasty

'You don't know persecution until you're a 12-year-old boy sitting in a church pew when your preacher encourages everyone to vote to make gay marriage illegal because they think you don't deserve the same joy of raising a family due to your depravity...When you know that, then you can talk about persecution.'

The writer ends the letter on a positive note, saying that though Robertson's comments can cause homophobia to flare up in the south, he doesn't let it discredit him.

'My love isn't different. It isn't unholy. It isn't wrong because a man with a beard said so in a GQ article. My love is real. And it's not going away.'
