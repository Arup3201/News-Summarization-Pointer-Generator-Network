Hamas should be removed from the EU's 'terrorist list', the organisation's second highest court has ruled, leading to widespread outrage.

The court defended the ruling, saying the process which saw Hamas put on the list in the first place was flawed, as the decision was based on media reports and not analysis of facts.

The EU has said it still considers Hamas to be a terrorist group, despite the court's verdict, and may appeal.

Not terrorists: The General Court of the EU has ruled that Hamas can no longer be included on the EU's terrorist list as the process which saw it put on the list in 2001 was flawed

Deputy Hamas chief Moussa Abu Marzouk said the EU court's ruling is is a correction of a historical mistake the European Union had made 

'The EU continues to consider Hamas a terrorist organisation,' European Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said today, adding that the EU will consider its response to the ruling.

The General Court of the European Union, the bloc's second highest tribunal located in Luxembourg , said EU member states could maintain their freeze on Hamas's assets for three months, to give time for further review or to appeal the verdict.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke shortly after the ruling was announced, demanding the EU immediately restore Hamas to its terrorism blacklist.

'We are not satisfied with the European Union's explanation that the removal of Hamas from its list of terrorist organisations is a 'technical matter',' Netanyahu said in a statement from Jerusalem today.

'We expect it (the EU) to put Hamas back on the list forthwith given that it is understood by all that Hamas -- a murderous terrorist organisation, the covenant of which specifies the destruction of Israel as its goal -- is an inseparable part of this list,' he said.

Israel's protests were unsurprisingly followed by cheers from Hamas in the Gaza strip, as representatives welcomed the verdict.

'The decision is a correction of a historical mistake the
European Union had made,' Deputy Hamas chief Moussa Abu Marzouk said.

'Hamas is a resistance movement and it has a
natural right according to all international laws and standards
to resist the occupation,' Marzouk said.

The EU court did not consider the merits of whether Hamas
should be classified as a terror group, but reviewed the
original decision-making process. 

This, it said, did not include
the considered opinion of competent authorities, but rather
relied on media and Internet reports.

'The court stresses that those annulments, on fundamental
procedural grounds, do not imply any substantive assessment of
the question of the classification of Hamas as a terrorist
group,' the court said in a statement.

It added that if an appeal was brought before the EU's top
court, the European Court of Justice, the freeze of Hamas funds
should continue until the legal process was complete.

Appeals, which can only be based on points of law, may be
brought within two months. The appeal itself would typically
last about a year and a half. 

The ruling comes just days after Hamas celebrated its 27th anniversary with an elaborate military parade through Gaza City.

Hundreds of masked and armed members of al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Hamas movement, marched through the city on Sunday, holding rifles and mortar shells.

Hamas holds sway in the Gaza Strip and its founding charter
calls for the destruction of Israel. It has regularly clashed
with Israel, most recently in a 50-day war this summer.

Most Western countries, including the United States, agree
with Israel that it is a terror organisation, pointing to
indiscriminate rocket strikes out of Gaza and waves of suicide
attacks, primarily between 1993 and 2005. 

Hamas says it is a legitimate resistance movement and
contested the European Union's decision in 2001 to include it on
the EU terrorist list.
