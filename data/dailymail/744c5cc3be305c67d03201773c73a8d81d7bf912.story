Trent Bridge has been given an official warning by the ICC for their 'poor' pitch for the first Investec Test between England and India.

The match fizzled out into a dull draw with both teams scoring over 400 in their first innings on a pitch that offered little life, and match referee David Boon marked the pitch as poor.

But, in a statement released on their website, the ICC confirmed that Trent Bridge received an official warning but escaped a fine.

Sanction: Trent Bridge has been given an official warning by the ICC for their 'poor' Test pitch

Dull: The match fizzled out into a draw and the ICC concluded there was not a fair contest between bat and ball

The ICC statement said that Nottingham's history of producing 'good quality international pitches' was taken into consideration, but also that the pitch for the India Test in July 'did not provide a fair contest between bat and ball throughout' and that 'that the pitch prepared for the match was of an unacceptable standard for Test cricket.

When a pitch is rated as 'poor' by the ICC, the penalty on the first occasion can include a fine of up to £8,907 and a second offence within five years of the first could carry a fine of up to £17,815.

This is the first time an international pitch in the UK has been rated as 'poor' since the ICC introduced a new process for grading pitches in 2010.

The warning was issued by the ICC's General Manager - Cricket, Geoff Allardice, and chief match referee Ranjan Madugalle.
