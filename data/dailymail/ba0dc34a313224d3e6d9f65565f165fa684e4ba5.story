Alice Powell's hopes of taking part in next weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix look doomed, even though her grandfather is ready to dip into his savings to help her become a Formula One driver.

Powell, 21, from Chipping Norton, was in the reckoning to drive in the first practice session for Caterham but the team's administrators told Sportsmail that they would sign two drivers for the full weekend rather than take on someone extra for one part of it.

Powell's grandfather offered to pay £35,000 for her to race in the first practice session

Powell hoped to line up on the grid alongside fellow Brits Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button and Max Chilton

Maria Teresa de Filippis: The Italian became the first female to race in F1 at 1958 Belgian Grand Prix.

Lella Lombardi: Another Italian, raced 17 times in 1974-76 and only female to achieve a top-six finish.

Divina Galica: The Brit was multi-talented, captaining women's Olympic ski team in 1968 and 1972 and driving in three grands prix.

Desire Wilson: Qualified 16th for home grand prix in South Africa in 1981, but retired after her car was damaged.

Giovanna Amati: Rose through F3 and F3000 ranks, though she never qualified for F1 grid.

And the bid of £35,000 from Powell's grandfather is unlikely to be enough to secure her a race seat.

'We have had five people show real interest in driving,' said Finnbar O'Connell, of administrators Smith & Williamson. 'Whichever two are picked will be involved in each practice session.'

While Powell's chance looks to have gone, the door may yet open for another young British driver. Jolyon Palmer, son of former F1 driver Dr Jonathan Palmer, is now a front-runner according to one well-placed source.

Palmer, 23, certainly deserves his break after being crowned GP2 champion last month, making him the first British winner of Formula One's feeder series since Lewis Hamilton eight years ago. 

Caterham's administrators launched a 'crowdfunding' project last week in an attempt to raise enough money for the team to compete in Abu Dhabi after missing the past two races.

They are over halfway towards their £2.35m target but time is running out with the cars due to be transported this weekend.

O'Connell said: 'I do believe we will be in Abu Dhabi', adding that 'one individual and one group of investors have made contact about helping in the long term.

Powell's management are still working to secure her FIA super-licence in the hope she could yet get her chance. 

Meanwhile, Marcus Ericsson has announced his departure from troubled Formula One team Caterham with immediate effect.

Ericsson has already signed a contract to race for Sauber in the 2015 season and will not now compete in the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

The Swede had been forced to sit out the previous two races due to Caterham going into administration, but the team is trying to crowd-source a return to the grid.

In a statement posted on his official website, Ericsson said: 'Following recent events re Caterham Sports Limited and 1 MRT Sdn Bhd, my adviser Eje Elgh and I have decided to terminate, with immediate effect, all agreements connecting me to the Caterham F1 team.

'This is a sad day as we have greatly enjoyed working with the team through a difficult and tough season.
