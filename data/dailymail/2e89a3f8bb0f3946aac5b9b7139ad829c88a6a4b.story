Russian customs officer opened luggage belonging to the band Roxette and posted pictures of themselves with the musical instruments.

The stunt was exposed when fans of the group spotted the images on social media in Russia and sent them to the band's management.

Roxette, a Swedish pop rock duo fronted by Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, are in Russia performing 13 dates across the country as part of their current world tour.

Fans spotted the images of Roxette's musical instruments online, with the duo Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle pictured performing here, and sent them to the band's management who contacted airport officials

The band said it would not make a formal complaint because nothing was taken from the luggage.

The photographs were taken by customs officials working in the Russian capital Moscow's Domodedovo airport. They show luggage containing the band's equipment had been opened and photographed, in some cases with airport workers in the pictures.

The pictures were then passed on to the band, who posted them online themselves to show the sort of problems they face during their tour.

Mikky Lindstorm, 42, who is running the tour by the Swedish band, said it was clear the images were taken at the airport but that it seemed nobody wanted to comment on the matter.

He said it was not the first time the band suspected its equipment, which was clearly labelled as being property of Roxette, had been opened and messed around with.

However, he said they would not be making a complaint because technically nothing was missing and therefore no crime had been committed.

The Scandinavian duo, which formed in 1986, shot to fame three years later with the hit song 'The Look' from their 'Look Sharp' album. The tune hit number 1 in the Billboard US charts.

The pop rock pair, with Fredriksson, 56 on vocals and Gessle, 55, on vocals and guitar, will take their current world tour  to countries including Lithuania, Estonia, Finland and Australia and New Zealand.
