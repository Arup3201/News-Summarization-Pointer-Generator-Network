Michael Schumacher is showing 'small, encouraging signs' following his skiing accident and his family remains confident he will 'pull through and will wake up'.

The update comes with the new F1 season just around the 
corner, and with speculation growing about Schumacher's condition given 
he has now spent almost 11 weeks in a coma.

It follows a series of reports that the former world champion racing driver's condition was worsening after his low speed ski crash in the French Alps.

Encouraging signs: Former F1 world champion Michael Schumacher, 44, suffered a head injury in a skiing accident 11 weeks ago

Schumacher has been in an artificial coma since December 29. But doctors say most
 artificial comas last for a period of two to three weeks.

In a statement issued on behalf of the 45-year-old's family, the F1 star's agent said: 'We are, and remain confident, Michael will pull through and will wake up.'

'There sometimes are small, encouraging signs, but we also know this is the time to be very patient.

'Michael has suffered severe injuries. It is very hard to comprehend for all of us that Michael, who had overcome a lot of precarious situations in the past, has been hurt so terribly in such a banal situation.

'It was clear from the start this will be a long and hard fight for Michael, and we are taking this fight on together with the team of doctors, whom we fully trust.

'The length of the process is not the important part for us.

'It is heart-warming to see how much sympathy his family is shown and I can say the family is extremely grateful for it.

'However, it should not be forgotten Michael's family is dealing with an extremely intimate and fragile situation.

'And I would like to remind all of us Michael has always actively kept his family out of the public eye and consequently protected their private lives.

'We try to channel all the energies we have toward Michael and we firmly believe this will help him, and we believe he will also win this fight.'

Schumacher was placed in an induced coma after undergoing two operations to remove blood clots from his brain in the wake of his skiing accident on December 29.

Schumacher remains in a waking-up process at the University of Grenoble hospital in France.

Given the longevity of his situation, however, that has led to an increasing number of reports he will never awaken, or if he does, he will be severely limited with regard to his functions and capabilities.

Today's positive news follows a report last week that Schumacher's family were informed by doctors treating him that the 
chances of recovery are now so slim that only 'a miracle' can save him.

Italian sports newspaper La 
Gazzetta dello Sport claimed that the seven-time world champion is 
no longer on a ventilator and is now breathing independently.

Focus
 magazine reported a last month that the wake-up phase had been 
stopped due to complications and that he was placed back in the coma.

That was denied by Schumacher's spokeswoman Sabine Kehm although experts say that such a super-fit 
individual would have expelled all the drugs from his body
 by now, and that if he was going to wake up, he would have done so 
already.
