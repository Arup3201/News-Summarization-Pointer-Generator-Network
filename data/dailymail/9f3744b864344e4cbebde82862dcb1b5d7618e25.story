Industrial action may be taken by staff at the Australian Tax Office if a proposed extension to their working day goes ahead.

Formal action is yet to be taken, but on Monday afternoon the ATO is expected to put forward a proposal that could require workers to be at their desks for an additional nine minutes each day, for no additional pay.

A spokeswoman for the ATO told the MailOnline that 'the day ends at 4.51 according to enterprise agreement.'

Staff at the Australia Tax Office could have their work days extended from 4.51pm to 5pm

The spokeswoman said this is due to the fact that core working hours are stated as 7.21 per day in the agreement.

However, Jeff Lapidos, secretary of the Australian Services Union branch that represents workers at the ATO told the MailOnline they are 'strongly opposed' to any push from the Government that could see staff finishing closer to 5pm.

He said the extra minutes staff could be asked to work per day 'is equivalent to cutting five and third days in annual leave per year'.

The ATO spokeswoman said they are keeping staff informed and currently working through a range of options.

'The ATO will negotiate in good faith with the CPSU, the ASU and individual employee representatives on its enterprise agreement.

According to the ATO enterprise agreement, the working day currently ends at 4.51pm

'We will be discussing a range of employment conditions as part of that process, but as part of our commitment to good faith bargaining we will not be publicly commenting on the negotiations prior to bargaining discussions.'

There are many hoops the unions need to jump through before industrial action can be taken, but Mr Lapidos said it was unlikely the ATO would change their minds unless they put up a big fight.

'Industrial action can't be taken in the immediate future as the fair work act lays down a process to be followed.

'(But) they have little incentive to change their position if they [the unions] don't take action.'

'The last time they tried this was in 2006 and we campaigned strongly against it then, and the tax office withdrew their position.'

On Monday afternoon the ATO are expected to formally hand down proposed changes

Mr Lapidos also said there would be no compromise from the union on working hours, and the government was trying to implement the changes for their own benefit.

'The government isn't prepared to share the productivity savings which are expected from the tax office over the next few years.'

'The purpose behind that from their perspective is to finance a minimal pay rise.'

The exact proposed changes will be formally revealed early next week, and if the tax office aren't prepared to cooperate industrial action could take place in the coming months.
