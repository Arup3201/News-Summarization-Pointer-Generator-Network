Stefanie Janikiewicz (pictured outside court) was nearly three times the drink drive limit when she drove for around seven miles at a snails pace along the M55

A teacher who drove the wrong way up a motorway after a wine and cocktails drinking session was freed by a judge today.

Stefanie Janikiewicz, 25, was nearly three times the drink drive limit when she drove for around seven miles at a snails pace along the M55 towards Blackpool, Lancashire.

When she was eventually stopped after seven calls to police from other motorists Janikiewicz stunned officers by admitting she thought she was on her way to Liverpool, around 55 miles away in the other direction, to speak to an ex-boyfriend.

She travelled for much of her 38 minute journey along the hard shoulder 'at walking pace' and she had so much to drink that she could not remember what she had done.

Janikiewicz, from Thurstaston, Wirral, admitted dangerous driving and drink driving at Preston Crown Court and could have faced up to two years in jail.

She was given a six month sentence suspended for 18 months and was banned from the road for two years. She was also ordered to pay £350 costs.

Judge Anthony Russell QC said she could go free because of her previous good character and the fact she was an 'impeccable person and popular teacher'.

After the case Carole Whittingham, of the Campaign Against Drink Driving said: 'The judge's ruling is an abysmal decision and as far as I am concerned sends out totally the wrong message. I would call for a minimum five year ban and a jail sentence.

'A short suspended sentence shows the courts do not take drink driving seriously enough. It is so disappointing. Driving on the wrong side of the road can have catastrophic consequences.

'This woman is a teacher and is a role model to young people. What sort of message does the sentence send to those pupils?'

Earlier Susan Carter, prosecuting, said the alert was raised on May 12 at midnight after police received seven telephone calls saying Janikiewicz was travelling in her Nissan Micra along the M55 heading towards Blackpool on the wrong side of the carriageway.

She added: 'An officer was deployed and it transpired that the vehicle was first seen in the vicinity of Junction 30 of the M6 at 11:37pm, seven miles from where eventually she was stopped.

'A PC Braithwaite travelled in the third lane and saw the defendant travelling towards him at walking pace, the vehicle was stopped and the defendant appeared dazed and confused and smelt strongly of intoxicants.

'She provided a positive breath test at the roadside of 97mg in 100 ml of breath. The limit is 35mg. In interview she could give little explanation as to how she came to be travelling on the wrong side for such a long period.'

She said that earlier in the day Janikiewicz had travelled from London to Manchester and had been drinking on the train. She had then gone for a meal in Didsbury, Greater Manchester, and drunk more alcohol before setting off in her car.

Mrs Carter said: 'Liverpool is a journey which she says she had taken many times because her boyfriend lived there. There was no accident but the aggravating features are the length of time travelling in the wrong direction, she was on the road from 30 odd minutes, and the level of drink consumed.'

In mitigation the court heard Janikiewicz works for charity Teach First, which trains graduates to become inspirational teachers working in areas of deprivation.

She was working with several schools in Greater Manchester, mainly in Bolton, alongside staff teachers to raise aspirations of pupils as well as their grades.

Defence lawyer Virginia Hayton said: 'On that morning she had absolutely no intention of driving that day. She had travelled back on the train to Manchester, she lives in Didsbury.

'It is a miracle there was no accident or 
even a near miss. It could have had terrible consequences not only for 
others but also yourself'

- Judge Anthony Russell QC 

'She had a couple of drinks on the train but had no intention of driving, she then went for a meal with her sister. Following an argument, she had little recollection of anything after that, whatever possessed her to get in her car she doesn't know.

'She is genuinely remorseful and grateful for the court allowing her to graduate. She is clearly an excellent student with Teach First. She hopes to return. She is clearly an asset to the education system and parents say she has turned their children's behaviour around. She is a popular teacher.

'She is aware that there is a custodial risk. She can see that it is such a serious offence which clearly crosses the custodial threshold. I ask you to suspend any custodial sentence.

'There was no excessive speed, she travelled little over seven miles the wrong way but it had taken her 38 minutes to do so. She has no recollection of the travelling.

'She must have travelling extremely slowly because it has taken her so long. There was no accident, she must have been crawling along the hard shoulder, it is an unlit road.

'One can only assume she was on the hard shoulder. Thankfully there was no accident and no one has been hurt, she could have killed others and herself.

'The impact of an immediate custodial sentence would be highly catastrophic. She has not touched alcohol since the offence.'

Sentencing, Judge Anthony Russell QC, told the teacher: 'It is clear that you were driving for some considerable distance while completely unfit to do so.

'It is a miracle there was no accident or even a near miss. It could have had terrible consequences not only for others but also yourself.

'It was a serious case of dangerous driving. The other side of the coin is that you are an impeccable person and have become a popular teacher. It is clear you have a great deal of support and it is very much to your credit that you recognise the problems you have and have been addressing that.

'This case clearly crosses the custodial threshold but I have come to the conclusion to suspend because of your good character.'
