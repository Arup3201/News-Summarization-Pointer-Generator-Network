President Obama announced late Friday morning that he has accepted 'with considerable regret' the resignation of scandal-hit Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.

But the shake-up had all the markings of an Oval Office firing.

At a hastily arranged press conference, Obama said: 'Ric's commitment to our veterans is unquestioned. His service to our country is exemplary.'

'I am grateful for his service, as are many veterans across the country,' he said.

The president said Shinseki, a wounded Vietnam veteran, was a 'very good man' and that it was his own decision to step down – he was becoming a 'distraction' to sorting out the waiting list scandal that has engulfed the agency and the White House in recent weeks.

It was 'Ric's judgement that he could not
 carry out the next stages of reform without being a distraction 
himself,' Obama said. 'My assessment was, unfortunately, he is right.'

But just a few hours earlier, Shinseki spoke at a meeting of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans in Washington, D.C., sounding very much like a man prepared to fight for his job with big plans to fix his agency's 'breach of integrity.'

Awkward: A visibly perturbed Barack Obama said Friday that Eric Shinseki was out as VA secretary, less than two weeks after his chief spokesman expressed deep confidence in the war hero who resigned Friday amid widespread troubles with veterans' health care

Out with the old and in with the new: Eric Shinseki (L) resigned as VA secretary on Friday, with his deputy Sloan Gibson (R) set to replace him on a temporary basis

Shinseki's resignation follows last month's high-profile departure of former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and may indicate growing dysfunction inside the Obama White House

MARCH TO THE SCAFFOLD: Shinseki (C) presided over a VA system whose medical centers have let dozens of veterans die while they waited to see doctors for the first time; his final appearance as an Obama cabinet secretary came at a meeting of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans in Washington, D.C. as he faced loud calls for his resignation

Obama also said Friday that he had received a
 report proving that reported medical-system abuses were widespread, and insisted that 
misdeeds would not go unpunished: Senior staff at the VA were being 
fired and bonuses cancelled for senior staff.

'I think he is deeply disappointed in 
the fact that bad news did not get to him,' the president said of Shinseki, 'and that the structures 
weren’t in place for him to identify this problem quickly and fix it.'

Support for Shinseki had quickly eroded on Capitol Hill, with more than 100 members of Congress calling for his ouster by Friday.

Many were Democrats facing tough re-election battles in states where Republicans dominate the electorate.

But leading the charge was Republican Sen. John McCain from Arizona, where the VA's most high-profile failures first surfaced.

'If Secretary Shinseki does not step down voluntarily,' McCain said Wednesday, 'then I call on the president of the United States to relieve him of his duties, to fire him.'

More congressional outrage and high-road commentary followed Friday morning's changing of the guard.

Another Arizonan, Republican Paul Gosar, laid the scandal squarely on Obama's shoulders.

'President Obama has ostensibly forced Secretary Shinseki to resign over the scandals and systemic failures at the Veterans Administration. I appreciate the President and Secretary Shinseki heeding my call and those of my colleagues to resign. But I say accountability ends at the President’s feet,' Gosar said Friday.

'As the sign on President Harry Truman’s desk in the Oval Office stated, "The buck stops here." ... The president needs to step up and set a better example of leadership.'

'With Secretary Shinseki’s resignation today, we can begin to address the systemic dysfunction that has plagued the Department of Veterans Affairs for years,' said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the powerful Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the House of Representatives.

'There are serious problems at the VA that won’t be solved simply by replacing the secretary,' explained a more defensive Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from the state of Washington.

Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer took a swipe at the Obama administration, saying the VA lacked 'accountability' and 'is in desperate need of stronger, more aggressive leadership.'

A pair of senators, one from each major party, also demanded a criminal investigation by the FBI.

Senate Appropriations Committee chair Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, and its vice-chair, Alabama Republican Richard Shelby, said they would propose a bill next week giving the FBI the resources it will need 'for criminal and civil investigations into allegations that the VA falsified patient records at centers and clinics across the country.'

'This scandal has dragged on over a decade,' they wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. 'We believe the Department of Justice should begin investigations right away ... and bring any charges that might be appropriate.'

New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, known on Capitol Hill as a partisan's partisan, said in a statement to MailOnline that Shinseki 'is in the fullest sense of the word a true patriot. In keeping with General Shinseki’s stellar character, he offered his resignation because he realized, as every good soldier does, that the buck stops at the top.'

Obama
 said Friday that VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson would step in as acting secretary of the 
VA while the administration looks for a permanent replacement for 
Shinseki.

The president said he spoke to Gibson this morning 
and 'made it clear that reforms should not wait.'

Fired? Shinseki sounded Friday morning like a man grappling with how to fix his ailing agency, but hours later Obama said he 'offered' his resignation instead

Famously aloof: Obama appeared Friday morning in an Oval Office interview on the 'Live With Kelly and Michael' show, calmly describing a 'serious conversation' he was about to have with Shinseki about 'whether he ... has the capacity to take on the job of fixing it'

'I said we will not tolerate misconduct, and we will not,' Obama said. 'I said that we could better, and we will.'

Obama also announced that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors, who is
 leading the VA's internal review of its practices, will stay on temporarily at the 
VA while reforms are put in place.

Support for Shinseki seemed to crater in recent days, with press secretary Jay Carney refusing on Thursday to answer a yes-or-no question
 about whether the president still had 'confidence' in Shinseki.

On May 19, as the worst of the allegations against the VA yet came in, Obama's chief spokesman stated flatly that 'the 
president has confidence in Secretary Shinseki.' But on Thursday he 
dodged a point-blank dare to repeat that endorsement.

Carney calmly offered a contradictory set of guidelines about actions the 
VA and the White House should take in response to the brewing veterans' 
health care scandal.

'This is very important,' Carney said just minutes into his briefing on Thursday. 'The VA should not and must not wait for the current investigation of VA operations to conclude before taking steps to improve care.'

Moments later he told reporters that President Obama would likely wait before taking action.

'The
 president identified last week that he expected a preliminary report 
from Secretary Shinseki's internal audit very soon,' instructed Carney. 'And once he receives
 that he'll be able to evaluate those findings along with what we're 
seen in the interim report from the inspector general, and then assess 
where we are at that time.'

Off the wait list: Shinseki couldn't survive more than 100 demands for his head from members of Congress

In
 his last public appearance as an Obama cabinet secretary, he 
apologized, and conceded that his agency had 'a systemic, totally 
unacceptable lack of integrity.'

But
 hours before he was to meet face-to-face with Obama in the Oval Office,
 Shinseki was focused on fixing that 'breach of integrity' – describing 
the firing of top VA managers at the agency's medical center in Phoenix.

While
 Shinseki was speaking, Obama was appearing on the 'Live With Kelly and 
Michael' show in a segment taped a day earlier.

He described a 'serious conversation' he would soon have 
with his VA secretary about 'whether he thinks that he is prepared and 
has the capacity to take on the job of fixing it.'

On
 Wednesday the VA's inspector general released a 
preliminary report showing that veterans in Phoenix, Arizona, waited an 
average of 115 days for a first medical appointment, and that 1,700 of 
them were left off of waiting lists and denied care entirely.

About 40 veterans died while waiting to see doctors in Phoenix alone.

An internal review of the VA headed up by Nabors found that managers at more than 60 percent of the VA's hospitals had been lying about how long veterans were waiting for care and there was a 'systemic lack of integrity within some Veterans Health Administration facilities.'

That report hit Obama's desk Friday morning after Shinseki delivered brief remarks to the homeless veterans group.

Shortly after, Shinseki resigned.

'He felt like new leadership would be -- would serve our veterans best,' Obama said on Friday. /And I agree with him. '
