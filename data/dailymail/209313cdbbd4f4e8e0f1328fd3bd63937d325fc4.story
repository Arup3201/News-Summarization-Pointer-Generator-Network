If you sign up to be a postman in Britain, trudging through rain, sleet and whatever else the weather throws at you is pretty much the job description.

Unless, it seems, you work in Doncaster – where Royal Mail is refusing to deliver letters to businesses in wet weather.

Two firms of accountants and a computer business in the town’s South Parade have been told to collect their post from the main sorting office when it rains, after a postman slipped on a wet mossy pavement and broke his shoulder.

'Bizarre': Amanda Henwood, who runs an accountant's business from an office in South Parade is one of three businesses to appeal against the decision

Managers at Doncaster’s main sorting 
office did manage to deliver a letter notifying the companies of their 
decision on Monday - a dry day - saying the postman had slipped over 
last Friday.

Yesterday customers described the move as ‘completely laughable’.

Ian Blessed, who runs a business on the street, said: ‘South Parade is a main thoroughfare into the town and people are walking along here all the time…With the weather we have been having, we will never get any mail delivered.’

The letter, from delivery boss Carol 
Wagstaff, says: 'It has been brought to my attention that on June 8, one
of our postmen sustained injury whilst undertaking the delivery in your
area.

'The incident 
occurred as a result of our postman slipping over due to the footpath 
and steps being covered by moss and algae and a health and safety risk 
assessment has been undertaken.

'This
confirmed that the level of risk associated with this delivery is 
unacceptable due to the wet weather turning the footpath and steps into a
dangerous surface to walk on.

'Under the circumstances, mail 
deliveries to your address will be suspended in wet weather conditions 
such as persistent rain, snow or ice, for health and safety reasons.'

'Beggars belief': Mrs Henwood said the letter did not make sense, because there are no steps up to the offices and there is no sign of algae or moss on any of the pavements referred to in the letter

Amanda
Henwood, who runs an accountant’s business from an office in South 
Parade is one of three businesses to appeal against the decision and 
yesterday described the move as 'bizarre'.

Mrs
Henwood said: 'The thing that really beggars belief is the apparent 
timetable of events. It took just 24 hours to do a risk assessment and 
decide we won’t get our post when it rains.

'Usually, it takes Royal Mail a month 
to let us know they are holding an item of mail on which postage has 
been underpaid, usually by something like 9p.

'When
we pay this, plus the £1 surcharge, it takes at least a further week to
send the item out, but when it comes to something like this it appears 
they know how to act fast.

'Laughable': Managers at Doncaster's main sorting office did manage to deliver a letter notifying the companies of their decision on Monday - a dry day - saying the postman had slipped over

'It just isn’t acceptable for them to 
tell us to collect our own post on days when the weather is wet. Will 
they pay for the time or the expense we will incur going to the sorting 
office?'

Mrs Henwood said 
the letter did not make sense, because there are no steps up to the 
offices and there is no sign of algae or moss on any of the pavements 
referred to in the letter.

Maxine
Downes from Woodford and Co, another accountancy firm with offices in 
South Parade, has also lodged a formal letter of appeal.

Ms
Downes added: 'In our business we need to be able to rely on the post, 
and with the recent price rises, with a large letter now costing costing
90p, this just seems to be going too far.

'We
have no steps outside our premsises and if the pavement outside is 
slippery then surely that is something for them to take up with the 
council.'

Royal Mail 
spokeswoman, Morag Turnbull said: 'Last Friday, a member of staff fell 
due to algae and moss on the pavement and steps at South Parade and 
consequently broke his shoulder.

'Following
a risk assessment of the area, we have notified Doncaster Council of 
the danger posed by the poor condition of the pavement and steps.

'We
have explained to customers in South Parade that we must suspend 
deliveries to their address as a precautionary measure until the 
surfaces are improved by Doncaster Council.

'Customers will be able to collect their mail from Doncaster Delivery Office.

'We
know this is inconvenient and we apologise to customers, but the safety
and welfare of our staff is paramount and we only suspend deliveries if
the safety of our postmen and women is at risk.

'Royal
Mail delivers to almost 29 million addresses across the UK and our 
postmen and women go out in all weather conditions including wind, rain,
snow and ice so it is always a last resort if we decide not to deliver 
to a specific address or addresses.'
