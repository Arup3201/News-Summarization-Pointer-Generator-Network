Kim Kardashian oozes confidence and poise as she showcases her svelte post-baby body in her new Lipsy campaign.

But the star has revealed that a few short months ago, she was left feeling insecure and wanting to avoid the limelight due to critical comments about how she looked whilst pregnant.

In an interview with Vogue.co.uk, the new mother said: 'For me, having people criticise what I wore and looked like when I was pregnant - that was hard.

'It made me feel insecure, so I have tried to avoid the limelight more.'

Negativity: Kim Kardashian says that negative comments when she was pregnant (l) were 'hard' and left her feeling insecure but she is looking better than ever in her new Lipsy shoot (r)

Kim, who celebrated her 33rd birthday on Monday, was slated by 
fashion critics for her floral sofa-inspired Met Ball gown earlier this year and
funny man Robin Williams even weighed in saying that he wore the look better as cross-dressing octogenarian nanny Euphegenia Doubtfire.

But the reality TV star, who announced her engagement to Kanye West on Tuesday, is having the last laugh as she and her sisters show off their money-making bodies in the new Lipsy campaign.

Kim recently revealed
that she had used the Atkins diet in a bid to lose weight after the birth and it seems 
that she couldn't wait to share the results of her efforts with fans through the new campaign images - as well as her personal Instagram shots.

She now appears to be confident in her skin again and enjoying being back in the limelight as she dons a range of fitted dresses for public
appearances.

She even ensured that her new range for Lipsy was full of the flattering designs she covets.

As she was: Kim was rarely spotted out and about during her pregnancy, save for the odd public appearance (l) and during her court case (r)

Me, camera shy? Kim Kardashian proved she has regained her confidence when she posted this saucy snap of herself in a white swimsuit with the caption '#NoFilter'

She's back where she belongs: Kim is officially back on form and has been out and about in a range of figure-hugging dresses

Now and then: Kim Kardashian (left) on Thursday 
leaving Ruth Chris' Steak House in Woodland Hills and (right) pregnant 
in April, tweeted she's lost weight thanks to The Atkins Diet

She said: 'That
idea of casual comfort that people love inspired the fabrics - there's a
lot of stretch. You know an Alaïa dress will hold and suck you in? I 
wanted to make pieces like that, pieces to make you feel really good 
about yourself.'

The Kardashian trio say their new range was inspired by high-end designers.

'Valentino and Isabel Marant aren't really our style, but their influence is reflected in the collection.

Kim, who 
showcases her new post-baby figure in the shots, said: 'The collection 
is inspired by the stylish women from around the world that I’ve had the
pleasure of meeting. This is for those Lipsy girls who have as much fun
with fashion as I do.'

They're back! Khloe, left, and Kourtney,

which will land in U.K. store Lipsy London on Thursday

They can't be stopped! The Kardashian sisters are back with a second line for Lipsy London after a stellar first collection in July
