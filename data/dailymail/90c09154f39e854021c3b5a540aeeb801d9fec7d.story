His family is under an intense spotlight after it emerged that Mama June's convicted sex offender boyfriend had allegedly molested her own daughter when she was just eight.

However, on Monday, father of the Honey Boo Boo household, Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, appeared to be shrugging off the controversy as he smiled and waved outside their home in McIntyre, Georgia.

Earlier in the day, TLC production crew were seen clearing the house of all filming equipment following the news on Friday that reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo has now been cancelled.

Something to smile about? Sugar Bear waving at their Georgia home on Monday …as child services 'open an investigation' into Mama June's relationship with convicted child molester

Should Mama June lose custody of her kids?

It was revealed today by TMZ that Mama June had exposed her convicted child molester boyfriend Mark McDaniel to the nine-year-old daughter Alana, who is the main star of their reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.

However, TMZ report that McDaniel has not done anything illegal by spending time with Mama June and her daughter Alana.

McDaniel is said to be not legally prohibited from spending time with June or her family, except Anna Cardwell.

But authorities tell TMZ McDaniel is in 'total compliance' and is on their 'radar'.

In a video obtained by MailOnline, Mike was asked if was upset Mama June had allowed convicted child molester Mark McDaniel around their daughter Alana, to which he replied: 'A little bit'

Asked about his thoughts on TLC canning the show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo he said: 'Yeah I'm upset that it's cancelled'.

Radar report that Child Protective Services in Georgia have officially 'opened an investigation to determine if any crimes have been committed involving her three minor children'.

Meanwhile, Alana - who is just one year older than when her sister Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell was allegedly molested - was also present on Monday, seen with her older sister Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14.

TMZ have released a picture which they claim was taken just last month of June exposing her nine-year-old daughter Alana Thompson to child molester Mark McDaniel.

Registered: McDaniel's crime is public record on the Georgian sex offender registry, as part of his release requires him to keep authorities constantly updated on his whereabouts

It had previously been reported that it was Sugar Bear who had been cheating on June using on-line dating sites, but now TMZ claims it was actually June who was having an affair, and used the story about Sugar Bear's infidelity to end her relationship with him. 

The revelation comes after a report in People hints that June now faces losing her children to child services. 

Susan Boatwright of Georgia's Division of Family and Child Services told People: 'From our point of view, when there are young children who are not able to protect themselves that are in daily contact or living with a sex offender, someone would go out and assess the situation and decide whether the children can stay there or not.' 

She added: 'If we thought a child was in harm's way in any way, shape or form, we would develop a safety plan and make sure the children are not around an offender.'

Despite the startling revelations about McDaniel's past, his daughter-in-law Peaches McDaniel has defended him on Facebook, insisting he's a good father. 

Facebook message: The 35-year-old family matriarch took to social media on Thursday to inform fans, 'I want to make a post trying to clear up the rumors remember you can't believe everything you read!'
