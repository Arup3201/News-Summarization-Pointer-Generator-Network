She watched from the crowd as her brother made history during the Cricket World Cup semi-finals between South Africa and New Zealand.

But now, Kate ElliottÂ will have an empty seat at her wedding day this weekend when her brother Grant Elliott take on either Australia or India at the World Cup final in Melbourne on Sunday.

The bride-to-be and her fiance Daniel Plews had pencilled in their big day at the Waiheke Island in the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand on March 28 almost a year ago.

Grant had not played international cricket for 14 months so he thought he could attend his sister's big day

Grant, who was born in South Africa, had not played international cricket for 14 months before he was picked to play one of the great one-day innings for his adopted country.

He told his sister he didn't think he would be selected for the squad so Kate went ahead and locked in her wedding date.

But on Tuesday, the 36-year-old cricketer slammed a six off the penultimate ball from the world's greatest fast bowler Dale Steyn, giving his team a four-wicket win over the Proteas at Auckland's Eden Park and taking his team into their first ever final.

'From the beginning I said if you can reach your dream that would be incredible,' Kate told NZ Herald.

'He just looked so incredibly happy. I saw it in his eyes and you just knew - he is going to do it. He is not coming to the wedding so let's just enjoy this moment.'

Despite missing the opportunity to see his sister walk down the aisle, Grant has promised if his team wins the title, he will cover all costs for Kate and her fiance's honeymoon.

'We will hold him to that,' Kate told Sydney Morning Herald.

'I told him before he left, 'Go and win it now, not because of the honeymoon, but just go smash it.'

The Black Caps have flown out of the country for Melbourne ahead of the final on Sunday.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Kate Elliott for comment.
