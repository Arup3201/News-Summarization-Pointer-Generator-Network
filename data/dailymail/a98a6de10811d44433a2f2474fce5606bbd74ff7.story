A disabled Iraq War veteran says he was turned away from Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey for wearing a shit in support of his fellow Marines — all because it contained the image of a rifle in front.

Mario Alejandro says Six Flags turned his family away from the park because of this shirt

Mario Alejandro, 33, says he was with his wife and three children en route to a birthday party at the Jackson Township park on Saturday when a security guard grabbed his arm.

‘I can’t let you into the park with that shirt on,' the guard told him, according to NJ.com. 
'That shirt’s offensive.’

Alejandro, who was part of the initial invasion of Iraq in 2003, was aghast.

The t-shirt — which says 'Keep Calm and Return Fire' accompanied by a drawing of a red, white and blue rifle — was a Father's Day gift from his wife and kids, purchased from The Reconnaissance Foundation, a nonprofit that supports veterans and their families.

'I said that it’s 
not offensive — it’s a military shirt,' Alejandro told NJ.com. 'I told him that I am an Iraq 
veteran, I served in the war.

'But he said: 'I don’t care, you have to 
take that off — or you need to buy another shirt to put over it.''

Alejandro, who was left disabled after two tours of duty in Iraq as a Marine, says his young son started crying.

'I just told my son to remember this day, to remember how they treat veterans," he told NJ.com

Six Flags spokeswoman Kristin Siebeneicher told NJ.com that the incident remains under review. The park does not allow clothing with 'vulgar, offensive or violent language or images,' she said.

'If a guest is wearing such attire, we ask them to remove and replace it with another item of clothing,' she wrote in a statement. 'And if they do not have one, they are able to purchase a replacement item at a gift shop.'But Alejandro says he doesn't see anything wrong with his shirt.

'They’re military and they’re 
patriotic — that’s my thing,' he told NJ.com. 'I wore them to all over the 
place, to my kids’ baseball games – everywhere.

'And I got nothing but 
compliments about how great they were,' he added. 'No one ever said they were 
offensive, because it’s obvious that they’re in support of the military 
and the United States.'

Alejandro now wants an apology from the park — or at the very least a policy review. 

'I fought for this country, I laid in a hole for 36 hours with no sleep, and had friends die for this country and so the people here could have the freedom to things like visit amusement parks,' he told NJ.com.

'So when they told me that I couldn't come in there with my family because of my shirt, a patriotic shirt, it hurt a lot.

'No other veteran should ever have to experience that.'
