Dottie Sandusky has branded the boys who accused her husband of molesting them as money-hungry liars as she opened up in her first on-camera interview since the 2012 scandal.

'I think they were manipulated. Once lawyers came into the case they thought there was money,' she said of the multiple young boys who accused her husband Jerry of sexual abuse.

'I think people need to know that Jerry is not guilty. You can see all the discrepancies in the trial,' she told The Today Show's Matt Lauer.

'I believe he showered with kids and that’s the generation that Jerry grew up in.'

Maintaining innocence: Dottie Sandusky said that her husband never sexually assaulted young boys even though he was found guilty on 45 counts of sex abuse and is now spending his life in prison

'Rough time': Mrs Sandusky said that her family has been extremely supportive- with the exception of her adopted son Matt who was going to testify that Jerry sexually assaulted him as a teen

Her husband is now serving between 30 and 60 years in prison after being found guilty of 45 counts relating to child molestation.

The former Penn State assistant football coach was accused of inappropriately touching the boys both in the locker room showers and in a basement bedroom in the Sandusky's Pennsylvania home.

In the trial testimony, at least one of the boys said that he was screaming for help when Jerry molested him in the basement, and he hoped that Dottie would come to his aid because he knew that she was in the house.

Dottie, who was never criminally charged herself, showed Lauer the bedroom where the boy alleged the abuse took place.

In the room: Sandusky showed Today's Matt Lauer the bedroom in the basement where one of the abused children said that he was sexually assaulted by the former football coach

'There was nothing that went on because I was here I mean I will take you downstairs. It is not a dungeon. It is not what that kid said,' Dottie said.

Lauer noted that because of their 'small house', it would be difficult for her not to hear screams.

'Because he didn't scream,' she said.

She also defended herself against critics who have called her a weak enabler to allow her husband's years of abuse to continue unabated.

'They called me Sarge because I kept everybody in line,' she said.

Teary-eyed: Dottie Sandusky opens up about how prison has changed her husband, former assistant Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky

Behind bars: Sandusky, seen center in October, was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts of child abuse and will spend between 30 and 60 years behind bars- depending on how long he lives

She told about her weekly trips to the maximum security prison where he is living, and how it takes her more than three hours each way to spend just an hour with him.

During the day, he is confined to his cell 23 hours every day, and then the remaining hour he is let out in an outdoor ‘cage’ while wearing waist chains and handcuffs- but even that respite depends on the weather. 

He also makes a weekly trip to the prison’s law library where he is able to spend two hours reviewing other cases in order to help strengthen his appeal case. She said that they talk of his appeal often and he remains very hopeful about his chances of being exonerated.

‘He reads, he meditates her writes he has a TV which is a lifesaver for him,’ she said. 

‘I really haven’t seen a whole lot of changes in him.

‘Jerry's still a happy person and he smiles and he tries to make people laugh. He said “I’m in the situation I’m in and I’m going to make the best I can.”’

Opening up: Dottie started to cry when she told how her husband of 46-years wrote to a friend saying that the things he missed most were his grandchildren and doing 'special things with friends'

Dottie gave some insight into her husband's life inside the walls of a 
maximum security prison.

'A friend had written to him and asked him what he missed, what did he take most for granted?' she said.

'He said family meals, the fun time with the grandkids playing ball, (and) doing special things with friends.'

She broke down in tears in the middle of her sentence, pausing to compose herself before continuing.

Dottie was the one to bring up their adopted son Matt Sandusky, who was willing to testify for the state prosecutors about 
how he underwent seven years of abuse at the hands of his father. He testified in a grand jury investigation that he was not abused by his father but then was planning to recant that testimony during the open court proceedings.

Matt spoke about the abuse, and whether or not his father's actions were an 
open secret in the football-loving community, in a documentary that 
premiered at Sundance Film Festival.

Support: Dottie stood by her husband and was at his side during his 2012 trial

During the Today Show interview, Dottie accused him of being a liar and a thief, who not only stole money from their family but also stole her husband's championship rings.

She
 said that even though they had taken him in for '15, 16, 17' years, he 
turned on them and tried to get his siblings to do the same.

'Our
 whole kids do not believe him either, he tried to get someone of them 
to turn. Money was a motive, he had some financial problems,' she said.

One
 major inconsistency that was repeated throughout the hour-long 
interview, which was posted online in spite of only a fraction of it 
being aired on Today, was the amount of time that she has known her 
husband.

Early on in the interview, Mrs Sandusky said: ‘I have known Jerry for 38 years. We've been married for 37.’

She repeated that at a later point as well.

Their side: Dottie was accompanied by documentary film maker John Zeigler who believes that Jerry, Joe Paterno and the Penn State administrators have all been wrongly accused

Those
 numbers effectively erase a decade of their relationship: Dottie and 
Jerry Sandusky got married in 1966 meaning that they have been a couple 
for 47 years.

She said as much in a letter to the judge that she wrote in 2012 pleading for a lesser sentence.

‘I
 am Dottie Sandusky, Jerry Sandusky's wife of 46 years in September. It 
is with a heavy heart I write this to you. I have known Jerry for 47 
years and he has always been truthful with me, even if it hurt,’ she 
wrote in the October 2012 letter.

The
 inconsistency even continued further with Lauer, as he actually read 
quotes from the letter and adjusted the number of years to reflect what 
Dottie had said earlier in the interview.

No explanation was given for the mistake.

She
 ended her talk by apologizing to the ‘many’ people who had been hurt by
 the scandal- specifically citing the Paternos, her children, the Penn 
State administrators who lost their jobs and are the subject of their 
own criminal investigations- but she chose not to include the young 
victims among the injured parties.
