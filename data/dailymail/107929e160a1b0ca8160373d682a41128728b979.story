An innovative £110,000 seaplane that aims to open up aviation to the masses has just been unveiled.

A production model of the A5, from Los Angeles-based aviation firm ICON, was recently seen at the EAA AirVenture convention in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

The 1510lb craft boasts a 100 bhp Rotax 912 iS petrol engine, giving the aircraft a top speed of 120mph and a range of 345 miles.

ICON say its intent is to 'democratise' aviation the same way that brands like Apple, BMW, or Oakley do

The 10.36m wings are foldable for easy towing and will fit in a garage, while the engine runs on both regular petrol and aviation fuel.

The manufacturers hope to capitalise on new Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) rules making 'sport planes' less regulated, and sports pilot licenses easier to obtain.

It has been reported that the company holds more than 1,000 orders for the A5, which is estimated to start at around £110,000.

A5s come with an optional ballistic parachute, a parachute ejected from the casing via a small explosion on top of the plane that brings the entire airplane gently to the ground in case of an emergency.

The plane is likely to go on sale in May and the company hopes to produce 500 planes a year

The aircraft unveiled at the show is one of three that will be used to verify performance and complete FAA approval prior to the start of customer deliveries in May.

The A5 was built over a five-month period, from January to June of 2014, and successfully completed its first flight on 7 July 2014 in Tehachapi, California.

'This is one of the most significant milestones to date for ICON. It represents the culmination of years of research, design, engineering, and manufacturing dedication by an outstanding team,' said ICON Aircraft Founder and CEO Kirk Hawkins.

'The A5 is no longer a prototype or concept aircraft; it’s a sophisticated, production-ready, consumer-focused aircraft.

'The entire ICON team is pouring its heart and soul into bringing the A5 to our customers, and it shows in the truly exceptional execution of the product. I couldn’t be prouder.'

ICON recently announced that it will relocate its engineering facility from Tehachapi, California, to a new 140,000-sq-ft manufacturing plant in Vacaville, California, beginning operations there early next year.

Once at full production, the company expects to be able to produce more than 500 A5s a year.
