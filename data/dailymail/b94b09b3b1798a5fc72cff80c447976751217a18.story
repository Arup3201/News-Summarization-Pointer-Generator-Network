Facebook's new 'timeline' feature - a new, deeper profile which allows you to 'fill in' more of your life pre-Facebook - was announced with some fanfare in September.

At the time, Mark Zuckerberg promised, 'you can tell the whole story of your life on a single page'.

Now it seems that the company is to launch Timeline - but only in New Zealand.

The 'timeline' view will give your Facebook page a more 'magazine-like' feel - and will, Mark Zuckerberg promises, 'tell the story of your life'. So far, though, only New Zealanders can enjoy it

Timeline allows you to organise your life into a chronological view - and you can even add the years 'pre-Facebook'

The redesigned pages have a more magazine-like photo-heavy feel, with a large 'cover photo' at the top of the page .On the right of the page there will be a timeline that breaks down all posts from a person's time on Facebook and allows viewers to jump back to people's earliest posts with a break down month-by-month.

'We announced Timeline in September and made it available to developers building apps on our platform,' the company said via a blog post today.

'Starting today, we are making Timeline more widely available as we measure speed and other types of performance.'

'We'll begin by making it available to people in New Zealand and then roll it out more broadly in the near future.'

Timeline has been available to a million developers in an early test version already - but has not been available to the public at all so far.

New Zealand has been chosen, presumably, because it has a relatively low population - just 4.4 million - and is English-speaking, allowing Facebook to iron out early problems with the service.

Even before launch, some have pointed out that Timeline, with its month-by-month approach, may have some unwanted side effects, such as allowing people to see who 'defriended' them and when.
