The opportunity to gain a college education - and therefore better job prospects - is increasingly beyond the means of many Americans, claims a new report from the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

Their research shows that college fees have soared over the past 30 years, while the median family income has remained almost stagnant once inflation is taken into account.

Since 1982 inflation-adjusted costs at four-year private non-profit schools have jumped a staggering 250percent, while costs at public four-year colleges have increased more than 150percent.

The universities blaming rising fees on record-high enrollments, a workforce of professors who have the skills to find work elsewhere if they are not well paid, and falling financial support from state government

Private colleges currently charge an average of more than $30,000 a year, yet 2011 census results showed only half of American households earning more than $50,000.

The universities claim they're caught between record-high enrollments, a workforce of professors who have the skills to find work elsewhere if they are not well paid, and falling financial support from state governments, reports Voice of America.

The CAP report has warned that ‘almost two-thirds of jobs in our economy will [soon] require some type of education or training beyond high school.’

Current figures already show that college graduates roughly earn three times that of high school dropouts and that the unemployment rate amongst graduates is almost half the national rate.

Drawn by low tuition U.S. students are flocking to Canadian schools like McGill University

Canadian schools like McMaster University have a combined 10,000 American students

Here are a sampling of tuition prices at some comparable Canadian and U.S. universities

U.S. universities:

- University of Chicago - $45,945

- George Washington - $45,780

- Stanford - $41,250

Canadian universities:

- McMaster - $20,966

- McGill - $14,561

- University of Winnipeg - $11,115

With soaring tuition costs and a 
generation burdened with massive student loans, more American students 
are looking to Canada for higher education at lower prices.

Over the last ten years, the number of American students at Canadian colleges rose 50 per cent.

Today,
approximately 10,000 Americans are enrolled at Canadian schools, 
according to the Institute for College Access & Success.

At McGill University in Montreal, about six per cent of the student body is American. And the numbers are growing.

In comparison to colleges like McGill, American students carry an average of more than $26,000 in debt and roughly nine per cent of those grads will default on those loans within two years of graduation.

Tuition is the largest cost of attending school in the U.S.

Eric Andreasen, 23, will graduate this spring with a political science major from McGill.

The Maine native had to chose between McGill and George Washington University in D.C..

McGill offered him a full undergraduate education at the same price of only a single year at George Washington.

Though prestigious, institutions like the University of Chicago are out of reach of some student's economically

Compared to their American counterparts, Canadian universities have massive government support.

'When the financial packages came in, it was a no-brainer for me,' Andreasen told NBC News.

Along
with lower tuition costs, American students can use college savings 
plans, U.S. student loans, and apply for Canadian university 
scholarships.

The application process is also streamlined.

Canadian universities typically care less about essays and recommendations, with grades and SAT scores more important.

And because the school's degrees are globally recognized the school's argue they are a passport to good jobs.

'I'm coming out with minimal debt,' Andreasen said. 'It brightens up the prospect of the future for me.'
