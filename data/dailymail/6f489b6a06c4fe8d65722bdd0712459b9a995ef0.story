A girl has a one in 70 million genetic condition, which means doctors expect her to get ovarian cancer within the next few years. 

Gemma Whitby, 14, suffers from WAGR Syndrome - a disorder affecting fewer than 100 people worldwide. She was diagnosed shortly after birth, developing cataracts just after she was born and kidney cancer at the age of two.

Gemma, 14, developed blindness and kidney cancer because of her rare condition. She is determined to become a DJ

However Gemma refuses to let her condition get her down.

Her mother Fiona, 40, said: 'You just wouldn't believe the obstacles she has overcome.

'You read all the time about inspirational children, but she really is one.'

The teenager from Bury, Greater Manchester, beat kidney cancer but her condition - which also made her blind - means she is much more likely to also develop ovarian cancer.

Doctors expect this to happen at some point during puberty.

Gemma is studying for her GCSEs at St Vincent's School for the Blind in Liverpool, and hopes to become a DJ. Her dream is to meet Radio 1 DJ Edith Bowman.

Gemma was born at 41 weeks after a normal pregnancy, but her mother suspected something was wrong when her daughter had trouble breastfeeding. 

Doctors at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital diagnosed WAGR Syndrome and at the age of two they found a cancerous tumour in her kidney.

The youngster had the organ removed but was dealt a further blow when she was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis - meaning she has to have a controlled diet, with no chocolate or sugary drinks.

Last December, she was hospitalised after eating Maltesers - and doctors warned her to avoid sweet foods or they could eventually kill her. 

Gemma is the only person to be treated for the condition at the children's hospital. 

Her consultant, Dr Indi Banerjee, said: 'It's a very rare condition.

'We have to keep a close eye on Gemma because there is a risk she could develop cancer. It's a horrible condition.'

The condition is caused by a mutation
on chromosome 11, with several genes in this area deleted. It was first
described by scientists in 1964.

Newborns with the condition have part
or all of the iris absent from their eyes and may have cataracts. 
Around half of sufferers develop Wilms tumours, which are tumours of the 
kidneys.
