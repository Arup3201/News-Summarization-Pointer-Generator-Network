Lindsay Groce Garder, 27, died of hypothermia with her 13-month-old daughter Hailey Gardner. Their bodies were found in a field in Fort Worth, Texas

A mother found naked and dead with her 13-month-old daughter died of hypothermia, a medical examiner ruled.

Lindsay Groce Gardner was discovered by fence repairmen lying on top of baby Hailey in a field in Fort Worth, Texas in January.

The 27-year-old's car was discovered crashed and abandoned 200 yards away.

Police found her clothes strewn in the field between the car and her body, indicating she undressed as she walked with her baby away from the car.

At the time Sgt Joe Loughman said: 'There were no injuries that looked like they would cause a person’s death.'

But the death was ruled accidental this week after a Tarrant County medical officer said Ms Gardner undressed in a 'very sad' and 'unusual' case.

Paradoxical undressing can occur in cases of severe hypothermia when the confused victim begins to feel as if they are burning up and therefore removes their clothing.

The crashed Toyota sedan was first reported around 8:30am on January 13 by resident Amber Bentley, who spotted the car after dropping her kids off at school.

'There's always deer in that field,' Ms Bentley said.

'I was looking for the deer and I saw the car. It was against a tree and the hood was smashed in and the driver's side door was open.

'I was hollering asking if everybody was okay, hoping if somebody was in there that they could at least respond.'

Since Ms Bentley had a child in the car at the time, she couldn't get out to approach the car, but called police and stayed until they showed up. 

While the airbags were deployed, police found the vehicle empty.

Ms Gardner and her daughter were found about 200 yards away from a crashed silver car

It wasn't until a man came to repair a fence at 11am that the bodies were found. 

Ms Gardner's Facebook profile said she had been married to Anthony Gardner since June 29, 2012. 

According to excerpts from a personal blog, published in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, she was a married freelance artist who previously lived in California.

In a post from August 2013, she wrote about stress concerning a move to Lancaster, California.  

She wrote: 'Why can’t things just go the way you plan them? Why does God constantly have another path? 

According to a personal blog, Gardner was married and worked as a freelance artist. In her last post from April 2013, she wrote about being pregnant and organizing a move to Lancaster, California with her husband Anthony Gardner (pictured above with their daughter)

'These are things I get to thinking. You’ve probably thought them before too. Why do we even bother thinking that? He already had a path. 

'It’s our scared insecure brains that try to tie all the knots of false insecurity together into believing that we are going to be ok because of our ‘plan'. 

Even though, constantly, again and again, our plan fails, falls apart, crumbles, vanishes. But God’s plans are always solid. He always follows through and takes care of us.

'Please pray for me and my family. My husband and I are going back to no home, no job, and pregnant.'

After the incident hundreds of friends posted memorials to Ms Gardner on her Facebook page.

One friend wrote: 'She was such a sweet spirit, so genuine, and an incredible artist. 

'She was so in love with her baby and we both shared a passion for gentle parenting. She wanted to be the best mother she could be for her.' 

Gardner was found naked, with a trail of clothes from the car suggesting she disrobed as she walked away from the vehicle

Caroline McLendon, who lives next door to the mother's parents, said she was 'just horrified' to hear about Gardner's death.   

'I wanted to tell her how sorry I was that this has happened to that lovely family,' McLendon told NBC DFW.

Resident Linda Fuqua is confused, like many in the community. 

She said: 'It’s perplexing, the fact the bodies were away from the car, you think they would have been in the car.'
