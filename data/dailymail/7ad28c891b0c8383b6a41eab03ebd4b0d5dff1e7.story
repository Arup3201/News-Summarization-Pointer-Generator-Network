A young mother died after her car crashed into a slow-moving HGV - but her five-week-old baby escaped completely unharmed, an inquest heard today.

Emergency teams and witnesses were at a loss to explain why Joanna Bull ploughed into the slow-moving lorry on the M40 near Bicester in Oxfordshire, leaving her with fatal injuries.

Her baby, Ruby, was rescued from the green Peugeot 406 estate car and cared for by other motorists until emergency crews arrived.

Paramedics rushed to the scene on the southbound carriageway near junction 9 of the motorway but were unable to save the infant's mother, who was declared dead at the scene.

Witnesses told the inquest in Oxford that Mrs Bull, who had married her husband David only a year earlier, appeared to make no attempt to stop or avoid the red articulated lorry.

A police investigation concluded she may have fallen asleep at the wheel, suffered a medical episode, been distracted or lost concentration.

The 29-year-old was travelling from her home in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, to visit her mother, Teresa, with her first born child when the accident happened at around 11am on Friday, June 13. 

Philip Crawley, who was driving with his wife Marilyn, was in the inside lane queuing in traffic waiting to get off the motorway when the crash happened.

Mr Crawley told the inquest: 'I was about five or six car lengths behind the lorry in front when a green Peugeot estate just came across in front of me.

'It didn't brake and it didn't swerve. It was going at about 70mph.

'It was strange, there seemed to be no input from the driver, it just glided past.'

Nigel Bennett was driving the HGV which Mrs Bull crashed into. He said he was driving at about 10mph at the time.

'At that point I heard a loud bang and my vehicle appeared to be pushed forward, making me go faster than I was,' said Mr Bennett.

Witnesses described seeing a cloud of smoke following the impact.

The lorry driver pulled over and walked to the back of his vehicle, where he saw the mangled wreckage of Mrs Bull's car.

At the same time, Mr and Mrs Crawley approached the car and noticed baby Ruby in the back seat. They took her back to their car while emergency services were called.

Ruby was airlifted to hospital as a precaution but was not injured in the dramatic crash.

Home Office pathologist, Dr Nicholas Hunt, said one person claimed to have seen Mrs Bull slumped at the wheel at the time of the crash but no other witnesses were able to confirm this.

Dr Hunt said there was no evidence that Mrs Bull had suffered complications arising from her recent pregnancy and said she was alive at the time of the crash.

'She had injuries that were completely unsurvivable,' Dr Hunt told the hearing.

'She would have been rendered immediately unconscious and unaware.'

A small brake fluid leak was found on one of the rear tyres of her car, but this was not thought to have contributed to the incident.

Forensic collision investigator Andrew Evans said there was no evidence of any alcohol or drugs in Mrs Bull and that driving conditions were good at the time.

'I cannot rule out as factors for this collision fatigue, a temporary medical emergency that has not been revealed, a prolonged distraction or a loss of concentration.'

Oxfordshire Assistant Coroner Nicholas Graham, who recorded a verdict of accidental death, described the death as a 'tragedy.'

Mr Graham said: 'There was no direct medical evidence to suggest that Joanna had blacked out, although it seems to me that is a possibility.

'There is no evidence that somehow this was an intentional act on her part or due to dangerous driving by other road users.

The family were travelling to Warwickshire on the M40 (pictured) to visit Joanna's family for the first time after Ruby's birth. The 29-year-old's family paid tribute to 'beautiful and vibrant' Jo

'The difficult issue is whether she somehow lost consciousness prior to impact.

'It seems to me almost impossible to speculate. It could have been any number of those factors that played a role.'

The medical cause of death was multiple blunt injuries.

Members of Mrs Bull's family attended the inquest, including her husband, but declined to comment at its conclusion.

Following her death, she was described as 'vibrant, beautiful, and caring,' in a tribute released by her family.

'Jo, who was tragically killed in a car accident, was a loving wife, mum, daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece and friend to so many and loved by all who knew her,' they said.

'She died on her way to visit her mum Teresa, with her five-week-old daughter Ruby, to meet newborn cousin Harry for the first time, and to have a catch up with big sister Soph, and niece Nelly aged two.

'Jo was vibrant, beautiful, and caring in so many ways. A girl who added zest to a room and who had found true love and happiness with her husband of just one year, Dave.

'To have her taken from her family at such a happy time is utterly unbearable.

'Jo, we never had the chance to say a proper goodbye, but we will never forget how much fun and laughter you brought into all our lives, you will remain in our hearts and memories always.'

Mrs Bull, who had a degree in Animal Science, ran a day care and boarding home for dogs from the livestock farm she rented with her husband.

The pair who met at a young farmers club, bred both cattle and sheep at the farm in Kenilworth.
