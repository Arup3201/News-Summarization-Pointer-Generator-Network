Rescued: Babe is starting to enjoy her freedom at the animal sanctuary

She has spent the past year cooped up in a council house - about as far from the proverbial happy pig in muck as it is possible to be.

But now Babe, the sow who was discovered living in the small end-terrace home by stunned officials when they tried to evict her owner, has had her bacon saved.

The Daily Mail has tracked her down to an animal rescue centre where caring workers say she is timid, and scared of human contact - but on the road to recovery.

Incredibly, her owner, Sean Varty, turned up with the unusual pet in the back of his car shortly after being ordered to leave his council house, and asked staff to look after her.

They are now seeking to pair Babe, named after the pig in the hit film, with a mate before rehoming the couple.

Lindsay Newell, a veterinary nurse who runs the Burton Wildlife Centre in Etwall, Derbys, said today: 'She doesn't like being grabbed or picked up. If anyone tries to approach her she runs away.

'She's in a stable on her own at the moment because she initially didn't like to be around other pigs, either.

But she's coming out of her shell a bit now and wanted to mix with the other pigs we have here. We're taking it one day at a time.'

It is believed Mr Varty thought he was buying a micropig when he purchased Babe as a piglet around a year ago. But Miss Newell said she was actually a Kunekune, a breed that, although one of the smallest in the world, can grow to two feet tall and weigh 15 stone.

Babe, who now weighs around four stone, was discovered last week when council housing staff forced their way into Mr Varty's home in Sinfin, Derby. For several weeks, they had been receiving reports of a strong smell coming from the property.

Even experienced workers were shocked by what they found - Babe had the run of the entire downstairs of the property, including the kitchen and bathroom, where it is believed she slept.

The floor was covered in a thick carpet of her mess, and mud.

When Mr Varty returned home, he simply put her into the back of his Renault Megane in front of the stunned council employees, and drove away. He is now thought to be staying with friends, while the council has been left with a £15,000 clean-up bill for the wrecked house.

A spokesman for Derby Homes, which looks after Derby City Council's housing stock, said they would be pursuing the 44-year-old for the cost of the operation.

Miss Newell, 25, said: 'A house is certainly not a suitable environment to keep a pig. In fact, I was disgusted when I heard how she had been living.

'They are quite clean creatures, and it would not have been good for her to be living in that mess. I was shocked. They're also social animals, and she wouldn't have liked living alone.

'Her owner called and asked if we took in pigs. He says he doesn't want her back. We'll try to pair her up with a mate and then look to rehome them in a month or so.'

Emma Fahy, 41, also volunteers at the centre.

She said: 'She's a bit scared and quite timid. She basically does not know how to be a pig.

'She's okay physically, but it's one step at a time right now. She simply should just not have been kept in a house as a pet.'

Miss Newell said the rescue centre was seeing an increasing number of people bringing in large pigs that they thought would remain tiny for life.

She added: 'Mr Varty said he thought he'd bought a micropig. We have had eight come in to the centre in the last six months or so. I think people have an unrealistic expectation of what they are buying.

'They see them on TV and with celebrities, sitting in their handbags, and think they remain tiny. But they get much bigger, and then the owners can't cope. I don't understand why people buy them.'

Neighbours think the pig had been kept in the house for more than a year and it is estimated that repairs to the damage of the home will be in the region of £10,000 to £15,000

Fancy a bath? Derby Homes, which manages council housing in the city, said the tenant was an 'excessive hoarder' and that some rooms were so full of junk that they could not get in at all

The garden isn't much better full of old bits of wood, a barbecue. At one point there were two ponies in the garden

The house looks fairly respectable from outside but behind the front door it was full of disgusting rubbish
