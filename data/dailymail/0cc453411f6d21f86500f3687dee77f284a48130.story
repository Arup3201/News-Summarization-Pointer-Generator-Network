The RSPCA has blasted the 'sickening' discovery of five dead ponies who were found piled up on top of each other in a village field.

The grim discovery was found by a member of the public on Tuesday in a field on Rempstone Road in East Leake, Nottinghamshire.

The passer-by then called the police and the RSPCA is now investigating after they removed the bodies of the animals and are searching for the owners.

The five dead ponies who were discovered piled up on top of each other in a village field in East Leake, Nottinghamshire 

It is believed the horses were badly neglected as they were found with large bruises and the charity added they were thankful no children had seen the bodies.

Inspector Clint Davies from the charity said: 'This was a shocking discovery. Even in a nation of animal lovers, there are thousands of people out there who don't care about their animals at all.

'In fact, some literally treat them like rubbish. It's a bit like fly-tipping.

‘We can only speculate how they've died but they weren’t in particularly good condition from what we could see from the bodies.’

Residents in the village also told of their shock at the discovery.

The RSPCA are now searching for the horses owners saying they believe they had been badly neglected before they died 

Geoff Adams, 59, told the Nottingham Post: 'The village is usually quiet so it's come as a huge shock, especially because it's so close to Christmas.

While Jennifer Marshall, 36, added: 'I hope people change their attitude towards animals.

'My 11-year-old daughter rides horses and she's devastated by the news.'

RSPCA chief inspector Cathy Hyde, who heads a specialist team of equine officers, said the dumping of horses has become a growing problem across the UK.

The ponies were found dead in a field on this road in East Leake, Nottinghamshire by a passer-by 

She added: 'Over the past five years there has been a marked and very worrying increase in equine neglect and abuse.

'This is witnessed on a daily basis by front line staff.

'This disturbing trend in neglect seems to be affecting equines more than any other animals that we deal with.'

Police say it is up to the RSPCA if they want to pursue a prosecution against the owners.
