Changes: Whitehall insiders said Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (pictured yesterday) had ordered a review on changing the current sentencing regime

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is to change Britain’s ‘dishonest’ sentencing rules that allow inmates to walk free halfway through their jail terms.

The shake-up follows the case of ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne and his former wife Vicky Pryce who were released after serving just two months of an eight-month sentence.

Philip Davies, a backbench Tory MP campaigning for longer jail terms, said an ‘overwhelming majority’ of the public wanted inmates to serve the terms they were given.

In reply, Mr Grayling said he had ‘sympathy’ with this view and hoped to be able to provide further ‘reassurance’ in coming months.

The Tory Party has previously stated that it believes ‘many people feel that sentencing in Britain is dishonest and misleading’.

Whitehall insiders said Mr Grayling had ordered a review on changing the current sentencing regime, which was introduced by Tony Blair a decade ago. It allows all bar the worst inmates to go free at the halfway stage.

Mr Huhne and his ex-wife, who were jailed for perverting the course of justice by swapping speeding points, then had further time cut from their sentences in return for wearing tags.

Initially, Mr Grayling’s plans will focus on the most serious violent and sexual offenders.

Instead of being automatically freed, regardless of their behaviour, they will have to earn the right to be released.

This could include carrying out education or other work behind bars and showing a willingness to earn the skills to go straight.

The plan – likely to require additional prison places – will initially be limited to the worst offenders because of budget constraints.

But Mr Grayling wants to move to a sentencing regime which is easier to understand and will rebuild public trust.

One option is to introduce a system 
where the courts can specify minimum and maximum sentences.

The 
prisoners will only be able to leave jail after their minimum sentence 
is served by having earned their release.

Campaigning: Tory MP Philip Davies said an 'overwhelming majority' of the public wanted inmates to serve the terms they were given

Mr Grayling revealed his stance in 
questions at Westminster yesterday. Mr Davies, a Tory right-winger, 
asked him: ‘Chris Huhne and his former wife were released from prison 
recently after serving just two months of an eight-month sentence.

‘In surveys that I have 
conducted, an overwhelming majority of my constituents believe that 
prisoners should serve their sentences in full.

'Aside from locking them up for longer, will the Secretary of State say how long he thinks people should serve in prison before they are released?’

Mr Grayling replied: ‘On this matter, I have a lot of sympathy with what [Mr Davies] says. I am looking closely at this area. I hope to be able to provide further reassurances to him in due course.’

Making prisoners earn the right to be freed will be popular with Tory MPs left deflated by the recent rows over gay marriage and Europe.

But it also fits in with Mr Grayling’s 
theme of wanting a ‘rehabilitation revolution’ where inmates learn 
practical skills behind bars.

Steve White, deputy chairman of the Police Federation, said prison sentences should do ‘what they say on the tin’.

He said: ‘It is hugely confusing for the public who read that Chris Huhne is sentenced to eight months and then see him walk out weeks later. The same applies to someone convicted of murder and sentenced to life, something most people think is unequivocal.

'The idea that you get up to 50 per cent off for good behaviour, which in effect is lack of bad behaviour, is nonsense'

Steve White, Police Federation

‘If it does not mean that the courts should say so. They should be open and honest. The idea that you get up to 50 per cent off for good behaviour, which in effect is lack of bad behaviour, is nonsense.

‘There needs to be transparency – the justice system is to serve the people. We should be honest and say that eight weeks for perverting the course of justice is an appropriate sentence.’

Mr Grayling also said yesterday that the Tory Party could fight the next election on a  platform of withdrawing from the European Court of Human rights.

He said: ‘My party is looking at what proposals we want to put to the country. The vast majority of the population want changes to our human rights framework. If the Labour party disagrees, I look forward to having that debate.’
