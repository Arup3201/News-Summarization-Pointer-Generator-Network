One of Britain's worst boxers who is so bad he describes himself as a 'human punchbag' is getting back in the ring despite losing his last 50 fights in a row.

Robin Deakin, 27, won his first professional bout in 2006 but has lost every bout since then and currently has the worst professional record in the country.

He has been knocked out 12 times in his last 50 fights and has performed so badly that he even had his British boxing licence taken away.

But rather than give up, Robin got a permit issued in Germany so he can carry on fighting.

Despite his half a century of losses, he is preparing for his next clash against an as yet unnamed fighter in London on March 1.

Robin, of East Tilbury, Essex, said: 'I've been a human punch bag. I'd love a title. I'll probably never get one, but I feel like I deserve it.

'My record doesn't reflect my abilities really. There have been several times where I think I should have won on points, or got a knockout, and the decision has gone the other way.

'I think people expect me to lose now - but you can bet that I try my best to win every single time I step in the ring. Despite my record boxing is all I know, all I live for.'

Robin turned professional after a successful amateur career which saw him win 40 out of 75 bouts, including making it to the semi-finals of the British Youth Championships.

But since then he has one of the worst boxing records of all time

turning pro records office BoxRec say he has one of the worst boxing records of all time.

He said: 'When fights have been set up for me, they haven't always had my best interests at heart - I've been paying people's mortgages and it's cost me my licence.

'You look at boxers like Amir Khan and they have one big fight a year, at one point I had 19 fights in 24 weeks.

'I would get a call saying someone has dropped out and can I take their place. One fight I had seven hours' notice, and most of that was spent on a train to Birmingham.'

Born with a club foot, Robin endured 60 operations and could not walk until he was six.

He said: 'I've been boxing for 21 years. I took it up to build my own confidence, make my legs stronger and make people proud of me. I think I'm still doing that.

'I hope my comeback will make the British boxing authority give me back my licence so I can carry on living my dream.'

His record is still better than Peter Buckley who quit the sport in 2008 after losing 256 out of 300 professional fights.

The UK's boxing regulatory authority, the British Boxing Board of Control, suspended Deakin's licence in 2012 when they began worrying for his health after sustaining so many blows to the head.

BBBC General Secretary Robert Smith said: 'What needs to be stated here is that he has no British Boxing Board of Control licence.

'He had his licence withdrawn for his own interests. Robin's forthcoming fight is nothing to do with the BBBC.

'If he wishes to reapply for his licence, that will be considered, but he had his licence taken away for his best interests.

'The sad thing here is that Robin is a very nice young man. Everybody likes him, and he's mad on boxing. We felt for his own welfare he should be stopped.

'We have a duty of care to individuals and we would never knowingly sanction a fight with somebody incapable of boxing.'

Mr Smith added: 'The record looks worse than it is. He always put up a good show. He always did his very very best.

'He has had his time, and we wish him the best in any future endeavours.'
