People living on the East coast have been warned that a powerful weather system is rolling over the country from the West coast and will hit right in time for the Thanksgiving holidays.

The same storm, dubbed Winter Storm Boreas, was the cause of four tragic deaths over the past few days when it swept the Western parts of the country.

The system was expected to head east and reach the northern East coast area by the middle of next week, but not before hitting the Southwest again with rain, snow and wind, forecasters said.

Forecast: An East Coast storm scheduled to arrive on Thanksgiving is threatening to create travel chaos for millions of Americans

Bearing the brunt: It appears as though the Eastcoast and Midwest are in for a shivery few days

They are expecting the weather to create
chaos and havoc on roads and other modes of transportation during the 
busy Thanksgiving holiday season.

Rain and a sudden drop in temperatures could lead to a 
possible nor'easter for next week.

Having already experienced 
November temperatures colder than most for the last few years, brace 
yourself - there are are several heavy doses ahead.

Monday: A nor'easter is swirling together and it could hit the east coast just in time for Thanksgiving

Tuesday: The storm looks like it will stretch from New England down to the Carolinas, bringing snow, wind, cold, and rain along with it

Wednesday: It's a particularly dreary picture for Cape Cod. The area could receive hurricane-like gusts of wind

Thursday - Turkey Day: Given the storm's current trajectory, the nor'easter is expected to strike sometime between Tuesday evening and Thursday, during the busiest travel days of the year

Abnormally cold air will plunge into the Midwest and Northeast and there could well be a snowstorm on Turkey Day.

The storm is expected to bring a lot of rain to the Northeastern United States.

The first Arctic blast will arrive this weekend with another by turkey day.

Chilly outlook: Arctic blasts and a developing storm are making for a frosty reception during Thanksgiving

The storm could bring strong 
winds and heavy rain to much of region, with snow possible, especially 
in higher-elevation areas in eastern Pennsylvania and northwest New 
Jersey.

Although
it will not be a crippling snowstorm for holiday travel, it has the 
possibility of making air and road trips more difficult.

The
storm will for the most part be gone come Thanksgiving Day in most 
areas, but an impending cold front should still leave snow on the roads.

Predictions: Forecasters are warning Thanksgiving travelers to beware, as a sweeping winter storm system could bring icy roads, flight delays and more headaches to the holiday next week

Disruption: The Northeast will likely see¿massive flight delays on Wednesday in all major airports, because of rain, snow and low-lying clouds that wreak havoc with flight plans

November 27 will be the 'busiest single day of travel' with 37 per cent of travelers expected to leave for the holiday.

This frontal system spreading rain through the Southeast U.S. Tuesday may 
eventually team up with a plunge of sufficiently cold air arriving from 
southern Canada and the Great Lakes, according to The Weather Channel.

The
potential for accumulating snow in parts of the Northeast is in play 
beginning late Tuesday night, continuing through Wednesday, possibly 
lingering into early Thanksgiving Day.

Forecasters
say the immediate I-95 corridor from Boston to Washington, D.C. should 
see mainly rain from this storm, however they are not ruling out some 
light snow accumulations on the tail end of Boreas, particularly in the 
western and northern suburbs.

On its way: The system has already brought freezing rain, sleet and heavy snow in parts of the southern Plains and desert Southwest

Predictions: Although it's still six days away, forecasters are predicting there will be travel disruption thanks to a winter storm

Storm ahead: A NOAA satellite image taken Friday shows a storm system on the southern jet moving into the the desert southwest, producing heavy rains in Arizona and heavy mountain snow in New Mexico and Colorado

There will likely be significant delays at the major hubs of the Northeast on Wednesday, warn weather experts.

The most likely swath of accumulating snow in the East from Boreas would be from the Appalachians, to much of Pennsylvania northwest of Philadelphia to New York state, western and northern New England.

Early indications suggest snowfall totals would be modest, generally less than one foot in the extreme, but may be the season's first or heaviest snow of the season in many areas.

Prepare: Caltrans set a up a chains required station just south of Mountain High Resort in Wrightwood, California, to warn drivers of the snow fall

But first, in the next coming days, the Winter Storm Boreas will hit the West again.

People in the western and south westerns areas of the country are currently bracing for the stormier weather Saturday after the powerful system buffeted 
several states, stranding drivers in Nevada, forcing the postponement of
sports games in Arizona and causing water rescues in California.

Parts
of northern New Mexico have already received a dusting of snow, but 
forecasters say the latest storm to bear down on the state is far from 
over.

The National Weather Service in 
Albuquerque said the brunt of the storm is expected to cross into New 
Mexico on Saturday, bringing widespread snow through the rest of the 
weekend, frigid temps and gusty winds.

The fierce weather was linked to three deaths in California. Officials and news reports said the death of a person Thursday near downed power lines and a tree was being investigated in Oakland.

Another person died in Oakland after the man crashed into a fallen tree while apparently trying to avoid debris, and a 52-year-old woman died in Yuba County when a tree fell on the parked car in which she was sitting.

Firefighters in Tucson, Ariz., Friday recovered the body of a man who was swept away by high water in the Santa Cruz River.

Deaths: Three people were killed in Northern California as high winds battered the region and caused major power outages, and fallen trees and branches

Chaos: Flooding, mud and debris in Redlands, California, caused dozens of calls to firefighters of weather-related traffic collisions spurred by Thursday's downpour. There is only a small chance of a similar rainstorm again

Be ready: Parts of both California and Arizona can also expect more severe weather, with winter storm warnings through midday Saturday in the mountains and the Antelope Valley foothills

Forecasters said parts of both California and Arizona can also expect more severe weather, with winter storm warnings through midday Saturday in the mountains and the Antelope Valley foothills northeast of Los Angeles.

However, there's only a small chance of rainstorms like those which prompted flooding in California on Thursday.

A homeless man had to be rescued from a tree by helicopter and four others were plucked from an island after becoming trapped in the swollen Santa Ana River in California's San Bernardino County.

In northern Utah, transportation officials warned truck drivers of potential trailer-toppling gusts.

No accidents had been reported, but big rigs pulled off to the side of the freeways to wait out the winds Friday morning, Utah Highway Patrol officials told The Salt Lake Tribune.

roadway had been reopened, but the office did not have any information 
on the stranded cars.

The weather service said rain totals through Saturday morning could exceed 2 inches in the Phoenix area.

Powerful weather: High winds across the West battered the region and caused major power outages, and fallen trees and branches

Rescue teams: Authorities responded to hundreds of crashes as the storm dropped rain over desert and mountain dwellers

The wet conditions prompted the Arizona Interscholastic Association to push back high school football semifinal games set for Friday and Saturday.

Officials rescheduled the games to Monday ‘due to the weather conditions, field conditions and safety of the players and fans attending the games’.

Authorities, meanwhile, responded to hundreds of crashes as the storm dropped rain over desert dwellers.

At least one business in thirsty southern Nevada was rejoicing over the storm system. Officials at the Las Vegas Ski and Snowboard Resort north of Sin City measured 11 1/2 inches of snow at midday Friday, with a week to spare until opening day.
