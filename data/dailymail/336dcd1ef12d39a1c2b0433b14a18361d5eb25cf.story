One of the most influential names in today’s media was well aware more than 40 years ago that television could do the thinking for viewers.

Roger Ailes was planning a forerunner to Fox News in 1970 to deliver ‘pro-administration’ news for President Richard Nixon, documents show.

The Republican strategist and Fox News chief launched the channel in 1996 but had ideas for another partisan station decades before then.

A memo called ‘A Plan For Putting the GOP on TV News’ was discovered by a Gawker journalist inside the Richard Nixon Presidential Library.

It shows Mr Nixon’s aide was looking at a channel to avoid the ‘prejudices of network news’ in what he felt was the liberal establishment media.

There was even a now-unthinkable idea that it would be paid for and run out of the White House to avoid the ‘censorship’ of left-wing outlets.

He knew that ‘people are lazy’ because they were reading fewer newspapers - and with television the ‘thinking is done for you’.

Mr Ailes was a consultant to Mr Nixon 
and George H.W. Bush through his firms REA Productions and Ailes 
Communications, reported Gawker.

Documents reveal he gave advice on what kind of tie to wear, how to deal with Saddam Hussein and ensuring the media present the right message.

AGE: 71

BIRTHPLACE: Warren, Ohio

SALARY: $14million in 2010

JOB: Fox News Channel chief

FORMER WORK: Republican presidential adviser

BALANCE SHEET: Fox News had an estimated profit of $816million in 2010

He was also involved in obscure events such as the lighting of the Christmas tree at the White House in Washington D.C.

Mr Ailes organised staged events to ensure better media coverage and using his contacts to stop threatening narratives before they happened, reported Gawker.

But some of his ideas back then are in contrast to now - with him advising Mr Nixon to talk to high school students 30 years ago.

This was labelled as ‘indoctrination’ by Fox News - the channel he set up to be ‘fair and balanced’ - when Mr Obama tried it recently.

Mr Ailes did not respond to a comment request by Gawker.

The revelations come as controversial TV host Glenn Beck had his last ever show on Fox News last night and thanked Mr Ailes for his support.
