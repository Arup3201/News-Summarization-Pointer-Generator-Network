A New York couple has asked a judge to void the adoption of their two Russian-born children because they suffer from serious mental disorders.

The parents, whose names have not been revealed, adopted the youngsters, then aged six and eight, via Spence-Chapin in New York and Cradle of Hope in Maryland in 2008.

Although the children were reportedly described by the agencies as 'healthy and socially well-adjusted' siblings, it soon became clear they suffered from  medical and psychiatric problems.

In subsequent years, they allegedly repeatedly threatened to kill their parents, before being placed in state mental health facilities, where they remain.

During this time, the couple, from Long Island, also allegedly discovered that the children were not related and had been sexually abused.

The parents are now asking Nassau County Surrogate's Judge Edward McCarty III to dissolve their adoption of the youngsters, dubbed Child A and Child C, who are now aged 12 and 14 respectively.

And in an unusual move, Judge McCarty III has agreed to keep the courtroom open, citing public interest in the 'disturbing facts' surrounding the adoption, according to the New York Post. 

The case was first reported by the New York Law Journal. 

He said an estimated 20 per cent of Russian children adopted in the U.S. suffer from developmental issues, while 18 have died through violence by their new American parents in the past 20 years.

If this particular adoption is dissolved, the children would become wards of the state, which could see them either remain in mental facilities or be eligible for ­foster care.

Speaking in court, attorney Irene Steffas said: 'If agencies had to warranty that children are in good health, agencies would shut down.'

But she added that adoptive parents should be entitled to 'every doctor’s report, every shred of evidence about the child’s health and background.'

Adam Pertman, president of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, agreed that parents must receive accurate records so they are prepared for the challenges their children will face.

'They don’t get sufficient training. And they don’t get the support and services they need,' he said.

Over the past two decades, more than 60,000 Russian children have been adopted by Americans, at a total cost of around $330million.

In 2013, Russia banned U.S. couples from adopting its children in a move that was widely seen as retaliation for a controversial bill that President Barack Obama signed into law in December 2012.

The American action imposed travel and financial restrictions on human rights violators in Russia.

President Vladimir Putin's bill angered millions of Americans and Russians, who argued it victimised children to make a political point, preventing many from growing up in loving families. 

The couple's attorney and the two agencies involved declined to comment to the newspaper.
