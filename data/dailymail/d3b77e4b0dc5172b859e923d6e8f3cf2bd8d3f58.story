Gary Griffiths has been jailed for 16 years for trying to kill his ex-girlfriend by setting fire to her house

A jilted boyfriend who sent his ex-girlfriend a chilling 'goodbye' text before setting fire to her home in an attempt to kill her has been jailed for 16 years.

Gary Griffiths, 44, poured petrol through Tracey Powell's letterbox along with a burning piece of paper after she refused to take him back.

Luckily, Miss Powell, who dumped Griffiths after a two-month relationship, escaped from the inferno at her house in Walsall on March 4 last year.

Griffiths hounded and bombarded his ex-girlfriend with text messages begging her to take him back, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. 

On one occasion he even turned up at the school where she worked as a teacher holding a bouquet of flowers. 

But when she refused to see him again, he snapped and drove to a fuel station where he filled a five-litre container with petrol. 

Griffiths then drove to Miss Powell's terraced home and poured the fuel all over the front door and through her letter box.

He then used a cigarette lighter to set fire to a piece of paper which he shoved through the letter box before sending a text to Miss Powell, which read: 'Goodbye Tracey.'   

CCTV captured Griffiths waiting outside the house as he watched the fire take hold of the downstairs.

During the trial, Miss Powell told the jury: 'He wasn't that happy and said he was annoyed about the fact that we were not seeing each other.

'I was shocked and thought it was a bit aggressive. Literally as I read it I realised something was going on outside.

'I heard a noise like a clunk or like something shutting. I looked outside and I saw something like hazard lights.

'Instinctively I opened the window and I saw him and saw flames from the footpath below the window. The flames were at the front door.

'I asked him, "what are you doing?"

'He said, "I told you not to upset me." There was a lot of thick black smoke at the time. I called 999.

'I could smell smoke and burning and the petrol smell was really strong.'

Griffiths was later arrested and charged with arson and attempted murder. He was today jailed for 16 years after being found guilty of both charges. 

After the case, Stephen Davies, Acting Sector Crown Prosecutor from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'Unable to accept the fact that the victim did not wish to rekindle their relationship, Gary Griffiths sought revenge on his ex-partner and planned to burn down her house while she was asleep in it.

'Once he had set fire to the house, rather than call for help, Griffiths watched from across the road as the flames took hold of the downstairs of the house and then left the scene of his crime knowing that the victim was trapped upstairs.

'Through his reckless actions, he not only put the victim's life in danger, but that of the neighbours and the emergency services who were called out to tackle the blaze.'
