Being a billionaire is no longer just for the boys - at least in the United States.

A new map showcasing the richest woman in every state of the country proves that there are plenty of ladies making bank these days, and a whole lot of bank at that.

Be it through their own ingenuity, hard work or, in some cases, inheritance, there are more female billionaires in this country than ever before.

If I were a rich girl: A look at the richest lady in each state in the country

Keeping up with the Waltons: The ladies of Walmart, Christy (left) and Alice (right), are two of the richest women in the country

Marriage pays: Astrid Menks (left) topped the list, mostly due to her combined wealth with husband Warren Buffet (right)

And they make for one seriously impressive group.

The top two spots go to the ladies of Walmart, with Christy Walton's $37.6 billion fortune making her the wealthiest woman in all of Wyoming and her sister Alice reigning over Texas with a worth of $33.5 billion.

Other notables include Steve Jobs' widow Laureen, whose $15.6 billion have her on top in California, and Gayle Cook, who is the richest self-made billionaire on the list and wealthiest woman in Indiana with $5.2 billion, money she made by as the owner of the Cook Group, a medical device company she co-founded with her late husband William.

The list also includes women whose wealth is combined with their partners, like Astrid Menks, who is worth an estimated $66.1 billion when you factor in her husband Warren Buffet, and Elizabeth Koch, who takes the honors as Kansas' wealthiest lady with $36 billion when you include her husband Charles' wealth. 

Oddly, by this measure one would think Bill Gates' wife Melinda and David Koch's wife Julia would land on the list as the top ladies in Washington and New York repectively, but that is not the case.
