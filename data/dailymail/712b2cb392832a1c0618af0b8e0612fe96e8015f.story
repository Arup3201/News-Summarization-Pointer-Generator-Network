A 13-year-old boy has been arrested by detectives investigating an attack which left a football fan fighting for his life in hospital.

West Midlands Police said officers arrested the youngster on suspicion of assault at an address in Wolverhampton, just before 5am today.

The boy is the second person to be arrested by detectives investigating an attack on 44-year-old Watford supporter Nick Cruwys in Wolverhampton on Saturday, after an 18-year-old man was detained yesterday.

That man has since been bailed until April 8. Police described the latest arrest as 'significant'.

Mr Cruwys was tripped and kicked in the head in an unprovoked attack in the street, following Watford's 2-2 draw with Wolves.

The father of two, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, was attacked in Little's Lane, Wolverhampton, shortly after 5pm as he made his way to the railway station with friends.

An online appeal to raise funds to help Mr Cruwys, set up by a Wolves fan, has now raised more than £25,000.

After the latest arrest, police directly appealed to anyone involved in the attack to 'do the right thing' and hand themselves in.

Detective Inspector Toni Naylor, of West Midlands Police, said: 'We are pleased with how the investigation is progressing and the arrest of a second suspect is significant.

'But this is not the end of our inquiry, it's only the beginning.

'I am now appealing to anyone who was involved in the incident to think about their actions and to do the right thing and contact us or hand themselves in to a local police station.

'We will leave no stone unturned to find the people involved and by coming forward you will be in a position to give your side of the story.'
