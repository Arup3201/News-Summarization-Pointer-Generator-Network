Many people take up to four months to lose the weight they put on over the festive season, a new study has revealed

Next time you reach for another chocolate or mince pie, you might want to bear this in mind.

Many people take up to four months to lose the weight they put on over the festive season, a new study has revealed.

The average person will put on 4lbs between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day after consuming twice their recommended calorie intake.

And the bad news is that it can take until Easter to repair the damage.

More than a third of those surveyed (34 per cent) said it would it would take four months to get back into the same shape they were in before Christmas.

The results were revealed in a survey of 1,000 people for the diet company Forza Supplements which looked at excessive consumption over the Christmas and New Year holiday.

The vast majority of people (94 per cent) take a break from their normal eating habits as they relax with friends and family.

For 18 per cent of respondents this holiday lasts only from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day - with healthy eating resuming on December 27.

However, 44 per cent let themselves go completely through Christmas and New Year and 32 per cent party for more than a month - starting at the beginning of December. Just three per cent said they didn’t over-indulge.

Half of those surveyed (52 per cent) admitted to eating twice their recommended calorie intake over the holiday - largely because of the increased alcohol intake.

Christmas Day was by far the most fattening day of the festivities.

Just under a third of those polled said they completely let themselves go on December 25 and had a ‘complete blow-out’ - with consumption of a staggering 8,530 calories.

That is more than triple a man’s daily 2,500 calorie intake and four times a woman’s 2,000 daily limit.

Boxing Day was the second most fattening and New Year’s Eve was third.The survey found that just three per cent don’t over-indulge over the entire holiday.

For nearly everyone else, it is bad news 
with 24 per cent putting on between 1-3lbs, 39 per cent between 3-5lbs 
and 21 per cent between 5-7lbs. Five per cent will put on more than half
 a stone.

Weight gain: More than a third of those surveyed said it would it would take four months to get back into the same shape they were in before Christmas

While it is easy to pile on the pounds, shifting it afterwards is a lot more difficult. New Year diets clearly have a positive effect for some because 31 per cent have lost the extra weight by the end of January.

A further 24 per cent take two to three months to get back to normal. But 34 per cent said it would take at least four months to get rid of the flab. Just 11 per cent said they would lose no weight at all or get heavier.

Forza Supplements Managing Director Lee Smith said: “We all want to let our hair down at Christmas and enjoy ourselves. “But it can take months to repair the damage if you really let yourself go.

'Easter Sunday is on April 20 next year and a lot of people will still be feeling the effects of Christmas even then.

'The key to limiting your weight gain is to do simple things like eat slowly and avoid over-filling and make sure you take some exercise.'
