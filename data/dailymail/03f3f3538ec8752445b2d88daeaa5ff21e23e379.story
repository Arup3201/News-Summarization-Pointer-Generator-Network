Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane has contributed a staggering 22 points in the Barclays Premier League this season, while team-mate Christian Eriksen is runner-up on 13.

Kane is poised to make his senior England debut this week after receiving his first call-up and with good reason as Sportsmail reveal the top 20 players that have contributed for their clubs so far.

Yet Tottenham aren't alone in relying on a player or two. Queens Park Rangers would be bottom without Charlie Austin, and Burnley would be, too, if Danny Ings was taken out of the picture.

Kane's fellow Premier League top goalscorer Diego Costa sits 11th in the list, having contributed eight points towards Chelsea's title push compared to the Tottenham striker's 22. 

But how is all this worked out? Take Kane's hat-trick against Leicester last week, for example.

The 21-year-old's three goals at White Hart Lane helped Tottenham win 4-3, whereas without Kane they would  have lost 4-1 - hypothetically speaking, of course. 

Kane, therefore, 'won' three points by taking Tottenham from a losing position to a winning one, as he did against QPR on March 7 and Arsenal on February 7, too.

Kane was 500/1 to finish top goalscorer this year and his contribution  reflects a remarkable season under manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Elsewhere in the list, Arsenal are represented twice with third-placed Alexis Sanchez (11 points) and Olivier Giroud (9) leading the way. 

Fellow Champions League chasers Manchester United have Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney (both 8) to thank for comfortably sitting fourth as we enter the international break.

No Manchester City players, meanwhile, make the top 20 - not even the Premier League's third top goalscorer Sergio Aguero.

Olivier Giroud makes the list and sits seventh as his 13 goals have contributed nine points for Arsenal

Alexis Sanchez sits third in the list and has contributed 11 points to Arsenal's top four push

Chelsea striker Diego Costa may be the Premier League's joint-top goalscorer but he is nowhere near Kane 

Manchester City's Sergio Aguero, despite being the Premier League's third top scorer, does not make the list
