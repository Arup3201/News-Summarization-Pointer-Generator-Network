The Environment Agency put water voles, greater water parsnips, silver diving beetles and large marsh grasshoppers ahead of people in the flood-ravaged Somerset Levels, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

A 250-page agency document issued in 2008 shows that years of neglecting vital dredging which used to let water drain away much faster is part of a deliberate policy to increase flooding in the areas now worst affected.

The policy was revealed as agency director of operations David Jordan angered residents yesterday by calling the flood defences a ‘success story’.

In a 250-page document on flood risk (right) the Environment Agency sets out how it plans to deliberately increase flooding in the areas now worst affected, and appears to prioritise animals above people

He said: ‘We need to recognise that 1.3 million other properties would have flooded if these flood defences had not been built. That is the success story, if you like, that we are talking about.’

Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater & West Somerset constituency has been among the worst affected areas said: ‘What a stupid man – this is absolute stupidity and arrogance. This is a tragedy and disaster.’

The 2008 agency document shows the objective for the Levels was to ‘take action to increase the frequency of flooding to deliver benefits locally or elsewhere’.

In the document the agency says flooding on the Somerset Levels 'is not in itself a major problem' because it will be beneficial to wildlife including greater water parsnips (right) and greater silver beetles (left)

The agency claimed this might ‘constitute an overall flood risk reduction’.

But it added: ‘This policy option involves a strategic increase in flooding in allocated areas [the area of the Levels on the Rivers Tone and Parrett now underwater], but is not intended to affect the risk to individual properties.’

Lord Chris Smith, head of the Environment Agency, was called a 'coward' and a 'git' yesterday on his first visit to the Somerset Levels

From an environmental point of view, the document says, flooding on the Levels ‘is not in itself a major problem’, because it is beneficial to wildlife.

Among the species it listed as expected to thrive were the voles, parsnips (a type of flower) and insects, as well as various birds.

Under European Union directives, the policy document says, ‘we  have obligations to protect the habitats that have developed hand in hand with the man-made flood-risk infrastructure’.

‘From an economic point of view, a lot of money is required to protect relatively little when considered at a £ per square kilometre point of view,’ it says, adding that farming and housing, first established 250 years ago when the Levels were drained, might suffer from what it called the ‘redistribution’ of future floods.

However, the use of the land by humans was ‘based on historical practice which should be challenged in the future’.

‘This will have social and financial implications which will have to be considered carefully . . . We are aware that challenging centuries of drainage operations may be difficult, and it requires good communication and co-operation between various authorities.’

The document says the agency might have to close pumping stations built to move floodwater from the fields into the rivers and aqueducts: ‘It is likely that there  are some pumping stations that are not economic.

‘Many pumping stations are relatively old and in some cases difficult to maintain . . . Redistributing floodwater, while logical in some areas, may be difficult to promote because individual farms will be affected in different ways.

Homeowners in Moorland, Somerset, have been forced to wade through murky to escape rising flood waters

Residents on the Somerset Levels have been angered by the Environment Agency describing the flood defences in their area as a 'success story'

Phil Smithen, 63, was one of the last people to leave the village of Moorland which residents now believe will be completely lost to the water

'From an agricultural perspective, some may gain financially but some may also lose.’

The document, the Parrett Catchment Flood Management Plan, went through five successive drafts, the last in March 2008, shortly before the agency’s then chairman, Baroness Barbara Young, stepped down.

Last Friday, her successor, former Labour MP Lord Smith, was given a hostile reception when he toured the flood-affected area.

As he tried to address the TV cameras at Stoke St Gregory, a village on the shores of what has become a vast inland sea, one heckler told him he was ‘toast’.

On the ground – what is left of it – the reasons for the bitterness were readily visible.

Lord Smith had claimed that all the pumping stations were working flat-out, but on the Tone and Parrett, they are deserted and not functioning – because the silt which has clogged the rivers means there is nowhere for pumped water to flow.

Lord Smith promised residents after flooding last year that there would be dredging in 2013

The last dredging took place in 2003, and since that time, an agency spokesman admitted, the rivers’ water-carrying capacity has declined by almost half.

Even in mid-stream, clumps of weeds and islands of willow mark the areas now clogged with mud.

Last year, after another flood, Lord Smith stood on a bridge over the Parrett and promised residents there would be dredging in 2013.

But all that took place before the onset of the current floods in December was the removal of a few ‘pinch points’ on the Tone.

In his own flying visit to the Levels on Friday, David Cameron described the floods and waves of storms as ‘biblical’ events.

But the point being made by locals is that while some flooding this year would have been inevitable, when the rivers were not clogged and the pumping stations were working, water levels could be drastically reduced in a day or two.

If the drainage system had still been functioning, this could have been done in the gaps between each storm – greatly reducing the floods’ impact.

Dramatic confirmation can be seen just a few miles away, in the northern part of the Levels.

The agency has admitted that water-carrying capacity of rivers around the Levels has decreased by half since the last dredging took place in 2003

At the Gold Corner pumping station, three giant pumps are still lifting the waters from the rivers Axe and Brue up seven feet into the Huntspill Drain – an artificial watercourse about 100ft wide which runs straight to the sea.

But unlike the southern Levels rivers, the Huntspill is not silted up. The land for miles around is just as low-lying as the drowned villages and fields near the Parrett, but the flooding is far less severe.

‘The purpose of the rivers has been forgotten,’ said farmer Ray Adlem, 65. It should be to get rid of the water as quickly and efficiently as possible.

'You can read that 2008 document and conclude that running the system down has been deliberate. The Levels has always been an artificial landscape.

'If you don’t maintain an artificial landscape, it reverts to nature – and that’s what some people wanted.’

The tragedy is that even the intended beneficiaries of the agency policy have suffered.

‘Any time you went for a walk in the Levels, you’d hear plopping – the sound of the water voles diving  into the rivers,’ said farmer Edwin White. ‘I haven’t seen a vole for ten years. They’ve all been drowned.’

As apocalyptic weather batters large parts of the British Isles, a few patches of brightness have nonetheless broken through.

A double rainbow brought a welcome splash of colour to the urban landscape of East London yesterday as it shimmered over the dull skies of Hackney.

And in Portsmouth, a mother and her young son seized their chance when the city’s Bransbury Park was briefly bathed in sunshine.

The pair were even treated to a foretaste of spring as they found themselves walking among a vivid yellow bed of crocuses which had managed to defy  the downpours and emerge undrowned from the sodden soil.
