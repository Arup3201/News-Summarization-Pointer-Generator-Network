Steven Gerrard is walking away from English football having never lifted the greatest domestic trophy – the Barclays Premier League – but he is not alone.

There are a whole host of other great players who have graced the game in this country but never got their hands on the holy grail.

Sportsmail has compiled an XI of the greatest players to have played in this country but not won the title since the Premier League's inception in 1992. 

Brad Friedel

Premier League clubs: Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers, Aston Villa, Tottenham

Set the record for most consecutive appearances in the Premier League at 310 between August 2004 and October 2012. Consistently been one of the league's top stoppers, but spells at Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers, Aston Villa and Spurs, in 17 years in the top flight – and still going at 43 – did not lead to the league title.

Jamie Carragher

Club: Liverpool

The defender shared Gerrard's pain, winning countless trophies together – including the Champions League, the UEFA Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, two FA Cups, three League Cups, and the Community Shield – but never the league title. During his 17 years at Liverpool, Carragher was one of the most consistently high performing defenders in the top flight.

Marcel Desailly

PL club: Chelsea

One of the best centre backs in the world during his six years at Chelsea, but though he won the World Cup and European Cup with France during that time it did not work out as well in west London. Lifted the FA Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Charity Shield while at Stamford Bridge and countless other titles across Europe – including twice the Champions League.

Ledley King

Club: Tottenham

On raw ability King is up there with the best of them, but chronic knee problems held him back. Once described as a 'freak' by Harry Redknapp because he could not kick a ball in training and only play one game a week but still be the best player on the pitch at the heart of defence. Won the League Cup in 13 years at Spurs, but nothing else.

Steven Gerrard

Club: Liverpool

He is perhaps the greatest player not to have won the Premier League, given that he has been at a club who have had the squad to win it for countless seasons he has been there but never quite made it. Last season was the closest he came, slipping up at the death – literally, against Chelsea – to allow Manchester City to pip them to it by two points.

David Ginola

PL clubs: Newcastle, Tottenham, Aston Villa, Everton

The mercurial Frenchman was an integral part of the Newcastle side who, in the 1995-96 season, agonisingly threw away a 10-point lead in January to finish four points behind Manchester United. That was as close as he got, despite seven years in English football.

Matt Le Tissier

Club: Southampton

Le Tissier did not win a single trophy despite 16 years dazzling English football with his skills and goals at Southampton. Perhaps his devotion to the south coast club cost him a chance at winning cups, but it did not stop him being regarded as one of the country's great midfielders.

Cesc Fabregas

PL club: Arsenal, Chelsea

Remarkably never won the Premier League with Arsenal. He played League Cup matches for the club during the 2003-04 season when they won the title, but did not break into the first team in the league until the following campaign, and they have not won it since. This could be his year, at rivals Chelsea.

Gareth Bale

PL club: Tottenham

You would not bet against the Real Madrid winger winning the Premier League one day, but he hasn't yet. When he left Spurs in that world record £86million deal he was without a trophy but he has since gone on to win four in his first 18 months in Spain.

Gianfranco Zola

PL club: Chelsea

Won the Serie A title alongside Diego Maradona at Napoli and lit up the Premier League when he moved to England in 1996. Seven years at Chelsea produced some sparkling football and moments of magic from the mercurial Italian and six other trophies – but not the Premier League.

Robbie Fowler

PL clubs: Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester City

The player to hit the most goals in the Premier League without winning the title, sixth on the all-time list with 162. He was known for his instinctive finishing, but though it brought him many trophies at Liverpool, the league was not one of them.
