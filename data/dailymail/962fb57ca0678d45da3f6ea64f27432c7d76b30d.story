Sam Tomkins would be happy to switch to his old half-back role for England in the Four Nations Series but he expects Gareth Widdop to claim the number six jersey.

Tomkins is a certainty for England's opening match against Samoa in Brisbane on Saturday week but has come under pressure for his full-back spot from Leeds' Zak Hardaker.

The former Wigan favourite, who now plays in the NRL for New Zealand Warriors, has noted the form of Hardaker, who took his spot in the Super League Dream Team this year, and welcomes the competition for the number one shirt.

'I've seen a number of his games this year and he's been brilliant,' said Tomkins, who returned home when the Warriors failed to reach the play-offs but will be on the plane to Brisbane with his England team-mates on Tuesday night.

'Zak's progressing the older he gets and he's put himself in a great position.

'He has obviously been outstanding this year and (head coach) Steve McNamara's going to have some tough choices to make I think.

'But that's good. It means every week we're going to put a good team out.'

With only two specialist half-backs in McNamara's 24-man squad, Widdop is expected to partner Wigan scrum-half Matty Smith but Tomkins, who began his career as a stand-off, is ready to step in if required.

'I've not spoken to Steve about that,' he said. 'It will be up to him.

'But the way I play at full-back, I do a bit of ball handling anyway so it's not massively different. I'd just get a bit more ball and try and create more than run.

'I wouldn't be bothered if I did or didn't, either one or six, if I had an England shirt on I'd be happy.'

Widdop, who made the switch from full-back to stand-off after being behind Billy Slater at Melbourne Storm, was belatedly handed the England number six jersey for the World Cup semi-final last November and, according to Tomkins, has impressed in the role during his debut season with St George Illawarra.

But Tomkins believes that Gareth Widdop will stay at half-back and he will not be switched there

'Gaz has been brilliant this year,' Tomkins said. 'There were a lot of questions being asked because at Melbourne, Cooper Cronk had always been the dominant half leading the team and Gaz got the ball when Cronk didn't want it.

'People wondered whether he'd be able to do it without those others around him, but he's been the dominant half. His kicking game is pretty immaculate a lot of the time and you'd think Gaz would be that first choice at six.'

Widdop and Tomkins are among six NRL-based players in the national squad, with Josh Hodgson set to join them when he links up with Canberra ahead of the 2015 season, and the former Man of Steel reckons that will help England's chances of breaking their Four Nations duck.

'They'll know a bit more about our players but being in the environment of the NRL, with tough games week in, week out, that will prepare people well for the Four Nations,' Tomkins said.

'We've got a good squad together.

We're missing a couple of experienced blokes in Kevin Sinfield and James Roby that have been there in previous years but there's a lot of young lads in this team that have really stepped up in Super League and some in the NRL this year so I think we've got a great chance.'

Tomkins is especially delighted with the appointment of his former Wigan skipper Sean O'Loughlin as the successor to Sinfield.

'Lockers is the ideal choice for captain,' he said. 'He's captained Wigan for a number of years and has recently been successful at doing that.

'I couldn't think of anyone else better suited to captaining their country.'

Tomkins runs clear to score his hat-trick try during the Four Nations at Leigh Valley in 2011
