Former British Army officer Robert Jolleys arrives at Swindon Crown Court, where he is accused of expenses fraud

A senior officer fraudulently claimed nearly £220,000 from the Army to send his children to a top public school, it was alleged in court yesterday.

Former Lieutenant Colonel Robert Jolleys is said to have pretended he was still with his wife Judith after the couple had split up in order to claim the ‘eye-watering’ amount of cash.

The change in circumstances meant he would no longer have been entitled to claim from the Army’s education fund.

His three sons Rupert, now 22, Charles, 20 and William, 15, were being sent to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire.

One of the most prestigious Catholic boarding schools in Britain, it charges fees of £28,000 a year.

Despite no longer qualifying for the benefit when he ceased to be main financial provider after the break-up in 2002, Jolleys claimed the benefit for seven further years, a jury was told.

It was only a chance phone call by his wife to the Army that uncovered the fact Jolleys was no longer married.

He is also alleged to have ‘bullied’ his former partner to help him maintain the pretence.

Swindon Crown Court was told how Jolleys – a ‘highly intelligent and clever man’– would not have been able to fund his sons through the school without the swindled money.

The jury heard how Jolleys carried out the fraud while working for the Directorate of Education Training Services for the Army in Swindon.

Prosecutor Nicolas Gerasimidis said Jolleys did not inform the MoD of the change of circumstances to claim cash from the Army’s Continuous Educational Allowance, which pays 90 per cent of fees in certain circumstances.

It was in 2009 the deception was uncovered by accident.

Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘Judith phoned his base to find out where he was and she told officers she was no longer married to Jolleys.

‘This was a surprise to his superiors.’

The court heard that following the separation Jolleys, continued to live in quarters specifically for serving members of the Forces who were married.

The jury heard how Jolleys tried to ‘bully’ his wife into supporting the claim.

Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘He bullied her and provided her with a document which told her what to say.’

Records also showed Jolleys attempted to file a retrospective application in an attempt to change his status to reveal he was separated.

But this was rejected by Army personnel. Jolleys, of Whalley, Lancashire, denies 11 counts of deception and fraud between 2002 and 2009.

The alleged bogus claims totalling £218,094.11 were made at bases where Jolleys was serving in Upavon, Oxfordshire, and Harrogate, Yorkshire.

The trial continues.
