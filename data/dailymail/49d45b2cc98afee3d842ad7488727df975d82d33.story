Timberland boots graced the footwear market forty years ago and quickly became synonymous with high vis jacket clad workman.

But the humble boot is stepping back into the fashion forefront thanks to a few famous feet.

All the cool kids on the block - from Rihanna and Beyonce to Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn - have been stomping around Tinseltown in their beloved Timberland boots.

Step back into fashion: Timberland boots were more commonly associated with builders - but not since Jay Z and Rihanna have brought them to the forefront of the fashion world

Fashion-savvy Rihanna lead the trend, spotted by Grazia Daily, when she wore hers on the red carpet at the Brit Awards.

And it seems her famous friends have followed suit.

Kayne West styled his APC lookbook with them, Cara Delevingne complements her tomboy look with a pair and Jourdan Dunn even wears her with a dressing gown in her downtime.

Even Hollywood's youngest fashionista Blue Ivy Carter has a pair. The youngster's tiny boots were displayed right in the middle of Mr. and Mrs. Carter's in an Instagram photo posted by Beyonce.

The
 one-year-old's shoes replicate her 43-year-old father's, with the Bow 
Down singer opting for a platform, high-heeled version.

And Blue Ivy has actually been spotted in her pair before.

Queen of cool: Cara Delevingne loves her trusty Timberlands and pulls the urban look off with aplomb

Speaking about the 
hot new trend, Lisa Haynes, fashion and beauty editor of the Press 
Association, said: 'Nobody can work Timberlands like the All Saints 
circa 1997 - complete with baggy khaki pants.

'In 2014, you need a distinctly edgy street vibe a la Cara Delevingne to really pull them off. Supermodel pins help too.

'If
 you can’t resist the lure of this workboot comeback, keep them classic.
 Avoid the towering heel homages that can take them into tacky 
territory.

'Opt for a 
pared-down look with leggings or slouchy trousers so your Timberlands 
don’t look too try-hard. Think perfect pooch walking footwear.

Even the kids are catching on! Orlando Bloom's son Flynn and Blue Ivy Carter are also sporting the style

'Me? My flat shoe obsession is sole-ly dedicated to the Chanel Couture sneaker.'

Celebrity stylist and founder of Style School, Alex Longmore, said: 'Timberlands are just the next thing in a long list of fashion must haves that have stemmed from the revival of 90’s fashion.

'I didn’t like these chunky boots the first time and I am not that keen on them now, they are the most unfeminine footwear you could be seen in and the garish sand colour and the heaviness of them just doesn’t do most of us any favours.

'The best way to wear them is to recreate the "models off duty look", wear with a slogan T shirt, baggy black harem pants with the bottoms tucked into the boots, a hoodie cardigan worn under a black leather jacket or for a different look, take a pair of black leggings worn with an oversized thigh length T shirt and an oversized checked shirt thrown over the top.

'A serious fashion faux pas would be to wear them under jeans or indeed with a skirt or dress. This look is all about going a bit "ragga" and a bit "urban".'

In 1918, Timberland founder Nathan Swartz
 began his shoe-making career in Boston, Massachusetts, as an apprentice
 stitcher and developed the Timberland brand name in 1973.
