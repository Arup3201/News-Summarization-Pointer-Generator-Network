The families who lost relatives on the Malaysian airlines flight MH17 in July are fuming after what they believe to be an insufficient offer of compensation made by the airline.  

The Sun Herald reported that families have been angered by the airline's offer of initial $US50,000 ($57,1116) compensation accepted by 15 families. 

The passenger jet was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 passengers, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.

The aviation lawyer who helped negotiate $10 million in compensation from Libya for families of the Lockerbie disaster said the offer was an 'insult'.

Jerry Skinner, a US attorney who is also co-associate of Sydney form LHD, is an expert in the law around aviation disasters and has been working with a number of grieving families to get suitable compensation following the disaster.

'Families from my experience usually file a suit not because of the loss alone but because of the loss of respect they feel from the carrier after the accident occurs, and that's what's going to happen here,' he told the Sun Herald. 

Mr Skinner believes there isn't a case on the MH17 flight that's worth anything less than  $US180,000, which is more than $AU200,000.

The aviation lawyer has also praised Prime Minister Tony Abbott for speaking out on justice for all those killed in the flight and his stance against Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Mr Abbott said he would confront the president over the MH17 tragedy, promising to 'shirt front' him when they next met at the G20 summit in Brisbane next month.

'And if you don't play hardball, Putin won't respect you enough to deal with you,' Mr Skinner told the Sun Herald.

But the Australian foreign affairs minister was able to talk with the Russian president first.

In a one on one chat with the president on Friday, Julie Bishop pushed the issue that access needed to be regained to the MH17 crash site

Mr Putin agreed to use his influence on the rebels in eastern Ukraine, to help experts return to the crash site.
