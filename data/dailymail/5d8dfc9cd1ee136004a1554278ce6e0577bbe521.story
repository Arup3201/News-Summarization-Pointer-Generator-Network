The invite said 'come and ride our mechanical rodeo bull and meet our gorgeous dancers' - presumably not at the same time, although that might be interesting.

The prize attraction at the latest City of London drinking hole Steam & Rye is 10 foot-long tawny brown bull complete with huge horns.

Weighing in at over a tonne and costing £60,000 this mechanical beast dominates the room at the 19th century Americana themed late-night restaurant and party bar.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Spencer rode the bar's bronco to the tune of Salt N Pepa's Push It

If Spencer had lasted until the end of the song he would have won himself a free drink

...Unfortunately Spenny only lasted for one minute 38 seconds, so there was no free drink this time

The venue, owned by night-club 
impresario Nick House and presenter, actress and model Kelly Brook looks 
like a slick set from an spaghetti western film, and when I put on the 
poncho and took my turn to ride the bull - I felt like one of the cast 
of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly - I’ll let you decide which one of those words relates best to me.

I
 mounted the bull and was told that if I was still on the beast when the
 song finished I would get a free drink. Sadly, the track, Push It by Salt N
 Pepa, was considerably longer than the one minute 38 seconds 
that I lasted.

Classic Spencer: The Chelsea boy was very taken with the bar's dancers, Sophie Jennings (left) and Bethany Rose Harrison (right)

It's much harder than it looks, and was quite a work-out. Perhaps not as tough as the gruelling one-hour gym sessions I’ve been doing with my Forza T5 supplements fitness trainers recently but I could still feel the burn on the thighs as the brown beast bucked me around the bar.

It feels a lot faster when you're on top of the thing and there was certainly no shame in my time - a personal best for me (not hard seeing as it was my first time) - I think I could have done better if my hair hadn’t kept falling my face.

The last flick of my hair with my hand left me badly off-balance which I was unable to recover from and there was a loud cheer when I made my rather undignified dismount.

After that I’d built up a bit of an appetite and I had dinner with London Live presenter Luke Blackall and the sirloin steak on the menu was excellent.

Although he won no free drink, Spencer was rewarded for his efforts with a steak dinner, accompanied by London Live presenter, Luke Blackall

It was very busy and with a great party atmosphere, amazingly so for a Monday night, and I can only imagine this place must be packed on Thursday, which is the city boys' big night out.

After the meal I was introduced to the venue’s stunning dancers, Bethany Rose Harrison (with the cowboy hat and Daisy Duke shorts), Sophie Jennings with the beautiful red Bluebella corset and frilly Can-Can skirt, and Mia-Jay with the rather fetching tartan trews.

The option of riding the bull with Bethany and Mia didn’t arise sadly. Probably due to health and safety issues, or something, but we managed to stay for a dance or three till the early hours.

All the best, Spencer xxx

Spencer was invited to ride a bucking bronco at London's Steam & Rye bar

If he could last for an entire track of a song he'd win a free drink

He didn't win a drink but Spenny was very taken by the dancers at the bar
