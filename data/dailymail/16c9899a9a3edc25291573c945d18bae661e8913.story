A judge yesterday issued an arrest  warrant for an alleged illegal immigrant who worked for the  Serious Organised Crime Agency.

Elidon Habilaj, 35, an Albanian accused of faking his UK application by posing as a Kosovan asylum-seeker 13 years ago, failed to show for his court case.

He worked for the Metropolitan Police before transferring to an office job with SOCA, which deals with criminal networks including those based in the Balkans.

The Serious and Organised Crime Agency was launched in 2006 to tackle 21st century crime. Director-General Bill Hughes, pictured, was in charge of the agency until 2010

But, after suspicions were aroused, he was ‘watched’ as part of a SOCA inquiry – even though the agency was unaware he actually worked for them.

After he was exposed Habilaj, of Wanstead, East London, was bailed and fled abroad, possibly to his homeland, despite not having his passport. He has renounced his UK citizenship and applied for an Albanian passport.

Habilaj faces charges including using false details to obtain leave to enter or remain in the UK from 1998 to 2011 and fraud.

Judge Martyn Zeidman QC said his trial could proceed in his absence in January.

He said: ‘On the face of 
it if he chooses not to attend court I can’t see any reason why the 
trial shouldn’t go ahead in his absence.

‘That’s not a decision I will make now. The trial judge will make that decision and he (Habilaj) should be made aware of that.

‘As he is not here today I issue a bench warrant not backed for bail.’

Elidon Habilaj was a clerical worker at the Serious Organised Crime Agency until last year

Prosecutor Richard Sampson told Snaresbrook Crown Court today: ‘This is a case that involves effectively a false asylum claim.

‘The crown say Mr Habilaj managed to gain employment with the Serious Organised Crime Agency using a fraudulent application.

‘Effectively the offence was picked up in due course and he was arrested.

‘The matter has been rumbling on since last year since it was listed at the magistrates’ court.

‘He was requested to attend and the officers requested him to attend.

‘The officers are here but the defendant is not.’

Manjit Dogra, for Habilaj, said: ‘The
matter was put for a pre-trial review on September 21, when the 
defendant was asked by the defence to confirm he was required to attend 
today’s hearing.

‘An email was sent and he was notified in writing via email at an address he regularly uses.’

At an earlier hearing, Crown lawyer Christiaan Moll said it was a ‘very sensitive case’.

He added: ‘Mr Habilaj was being watched by SOCA but they did not know he was working for them.’
