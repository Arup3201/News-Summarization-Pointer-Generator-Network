A teenage boy collapsed and died at school as he warmed up for football practice.

Mitchell Cook, 14, who studied at Canyon High School in Anaheim, California, was on the practice field when he fell to the ground.

School officials gave him CPR on Wednesday afternoon but the schoolboy died later at Kaiser Hospital.

Tragic: Mitchell Cook, who suffered from a heart condition called mitral heart prolapse, was warming up for football practice at school when he collapsed and died

An off-duty fireman also helped give first aid.

The child had a known heart condition call mitral valve prolapse, reported KTLA.

He regularly saw doctors for his heart problem but it was believed to have been under control.

Severe
forms of the condition, in which one of the heart valves do not close 
properly, can cause cardiac arrest in sufferers and death.

Friends at the high school have been offered counselling.

Staff and students held a candlelit vigil on the football field on Saturday in Mitchell's memory.

Local news reported that Mitchell and his younger brother had been adopted after being abandoned by their mother.

His friends said he was a happy person with a 'contagious smile'.

Ethan Rogers told KTLA: 'When you see him smile, you just smile.'

Another friend, Kenny Cho, said: 'I love him to death. He will watch over use and we will play for him.

'I heard the news and I was just, like, speechless.'
