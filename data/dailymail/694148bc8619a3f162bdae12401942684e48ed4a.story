John Cleese is reportedly set to earn more than £100,000 this year from an app based on one of Monty Python's most iconic sketches.

The silly walks app, which will soon hit one million downloads, is based on the sketch The Ministry of Silly Walks.

In that scene, which first aired in 1970, Cleese - a civil servant - parades around London doing a 'silly walk'.

John Cleese, pictured doing the silly walk, is set to make a fortune from an app based on one of Monty Python's most iconic sketches, The Ministry of Silly Walks

The scene, first aired in 1970, sees Cleese -  a civil servant - visiting the fictitious government department which is apparently responsible for developing silly walks through grants

He then visits a ficititious British government ministry which is apparently responsible for developing silly walks through grants.

The sketch was reborn earlier this year as a video game, released for Android, iPad and iPhone.

The game involves 'silly walking' through the streets of London collecting 
coins and power-ups, while avoiding pigeons and other obstacles.

The Sun reports that Cleese will now received £100,000 from his share.

Creator Chris Curd, master builder at Boondoggle Game Studios, told the paper: 'I effectively developed the game for free and it's doing great so hopefully it can help Mr Cleese.'

Cleese often promotes the game on his 
official Twitter account, posting his latest score and even challenging fellow 
celebrity Stephen Fry to beat it.

The comedian divorced his third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger, pictured left, in a £12m settlement. He is now married to Jennifer Wade, pictured right

On
 his official Twitter profile, it says: 'Yes, I am still indeed alive, 
contrary to rumour, and am performing the silly walk in my new app.'

Th reported sum could go some way to helping pay off the £12m divorce settlement that he reached with his third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger in 2009. 

He married his fourth wife Jennifer Wade in 2012.

Cleese recently performed his final Monty Python show along side his fellow actors, Eric Idle, 71, Terry Jones, 72, Terry Gilliam, 73 and Michael Palin, 71. 

The silly walks sketch 
was not performed during Monty Python Live (Mostly) but was instead replaced by The Silly Walks Song.

That ws performed by a group of (younger) dancers who mimicked 
Cleese's original walks. They also wore bowler hats and carried briefcases, just as Cleese did in the original sketch.

The famous sketch involves John Cleese, dressed as a
 bowler-hatted civil servant, visiting a fictitious British government ministry
 responsible for developing silly walks through grants.

Throughout the sketch, Cleese walks in a variety of silly ways. He eventually arrives at his place of business: The 
Ministry of Silly Walks.

In the 
hallway he passes other employees all doing their own silly walks, before arriving at his office. Once there, he finds a man - Michael Palin - waiting for him.

He apologises for the delay, explaining that his walk 
has become particularly silly and it takes longer for him to 
reach his destination.

Palin then explains that he has a silly walk
 he wishes to develop with grant money. He shows Cleese the walk - but he says it is not particularly silly.

He famously said: 'The right leg isn't silly at all, 
and the left leg merely does a forward aerial half-turn every alternate 
step.'

He tells Palin that he does not believe the ministry can help 
him, as his walk is not silly enough and funding is short.
