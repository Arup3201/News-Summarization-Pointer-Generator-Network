 

While most of us schlepped to university on a train, or begged a lift from long suffering parents, for some discerning students, arriving for fresher’s week is about making a statement.

In fact some high flying freshers now have the option to travel to their first day on campus using luxurious and bespoke transport options, including a private jet or helicopter, Rolls Royce Phantom and even horse and carriage.

The new ‘Very Important Fresher’, or 'VIF', service is the first dedicated to freshers with more money than sense, with a single journey by private jet costing £25,000 – as much as an entire degree.

A trip to university by private jet will set you back about £25,000- as much as an entire degree of tuition fees 

The McLaren P1 has a top speed of 217mph, perfect for sitting in those 'back to uni' traffic jams 

Billed as a way to wow and impress your future lecture companions, it seems like it might be more likely to alienate the 'VIF' from everyone else on campus before fresher's week has even started. 

Run by Uni Baggage, the service also transports the students' belongings separately- which is handy given that the trunk space in a McLaren P1 or Ferrari F430 (two of the luxury options available) is rather limited.

And you can forget living out of your boxes until your mother visits and unpacks for you - the VIF service will pack and unpack everything for you. 

Why not really set yourself apart by arriving on campus in a £10,000 horse and carriage?

Assuming your chosen university has a landing pad - helicopter is now a viable mode of transport for £20,000

Make like Jay Z and roll up in a Rolls Royce Phantom for just £15,000 for the one trip

Paul Stewart, co founder of Uni Baggage commented:‘The aspirations of students are continually changing and the need to make that all important first class impression is more paramount than ever. 

'We’re excited to be answering this demand by launching the UK’s first luxurious travel service for the students of today.

‘The Uni Baggage service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car. 

'Paired with our new VIF options, we’re looking forward to ensuring this year students reach University with minimum fuss and maximum luxury.'

How things have changed!
