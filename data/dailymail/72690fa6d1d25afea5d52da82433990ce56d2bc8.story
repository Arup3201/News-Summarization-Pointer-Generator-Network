'Sadist': Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, an undocumented immigrant from 
Poland, charged with 12 counts of animal abuse and one of misleading police in the brutal torture of a dog

An undocumented immigrant from Poland faces decades behind bars for allegedly torturing and leaving for dead a tiny pit bull dubbed 'Puppy Doe' in August.

A jury yesterday indicted Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, of 12 counts of animal abuse and one count of misleading police, with an arraignment expected to be set before December 20.

The indictments move the existing case from the Quincy District Court, where criminal complaints only carry a maximum sentence of two and half years in a county House of Correction, to the Norfolk Superior Court.

Prosecutors said Czerkawski obtained the dog free of charge on Craigslist and spent weeks brutally abusing her before dumping the tormented puppy in a Quincy park. The pet later had to be put down due to the severity of her injuries.

The two-year-old pooch reportedly was stabbed in the eye, burned, had her limbs pulled from the joints and had her tongue sliced in half like a serpent. It was described as 'medieval' torture.

'I just want to know so bad why he did it. Why her, of all dogs? What did she ever do to him to make him want to hurt her so bad? She loved everybody,' Puppy Doe's former owner Laura Hankins told the Boston Herald.

Investigators said they found Puppy Doe's blood in the second-floor Quincy, Massachusetts residence where the  illegal immigrant was living.

According to prosecutors, Czerkawski worked as a home attendant, caring for a 95-year-old Polish dementia patient woman in Quincy, Boston Herald reported.

Police say Czerkaswki left Puppy Doe in the park a day after his client passed away. Her death certificate stated that the woman died from 'failure to thrive' caused by her illness.

Authorities do not believe that Czerkaswki had anything to do with the woman’s passing.

Caught: Radoslaw Czerkawski was initially held on a fugitive from justice 
charge in New Britain, Connecticut

When asked during a press conference 
in October about a motive behind the sadistic animal abuse, Quincy Police 
Chief Paul Keenan said: ‘Who has a motive for something like this? He's 
probably just a sick individual.’

Following
 Czerkaswki’s arrest in New Britain, Connecticut, Sunday, police in New 
Bedford, Massachusetts, announced that the man was a suspect in 
the theft of about $6,700 from a local church, South Coast Today said.

Czerkawski
 is accused of stealing and cashing 11 checks from St Lawrence the 
Martyr Church, where he had stayed between January and April 2012 after 
telling the pastor there that he wanted to become a priest. 

A month after he left for Canada, the church noticed that three of its accounts were missing about $6,700.

Czerkawski,
 a native of Hrubieszow, Poland, has been staying in the U.S. on a 
tourist visa that had expired, according to The Patriot Ledger.

Cruel: This two-year-old pit bull was found with horrific injuries

In
 addition to the Puppy Doe charges, he is expected to face 11 counts of 
larceny by check over $250 and a single count of larceny in a building 
in connection to the New Bedford case.

Police found Czerkawski at a La Quinta hotel before he appeared in New Britain Superior Court  to start the rendition process back to Massachusetts.

The two-month investigation before Czerkawski was nabbed sparked outrage among dog lovers from coast to coast.

During his Czerkawski's arraignment last month,
 animal activists filled the Quincy courtroom to support Puppy Doe. 
Outraged dog owners and their four-legged friends also waited outside 
the courthouse.

'She 
didn’t deserve what she got. We’re definitely here with our puppies to 
support her,' dog owner Kelly Duncan told WBZ NewsRadio 1030.

Abused: Puppy Doe weighed only 18lb and had been stabbed, burned and tortured

Cops
 had spent weeks following the trail of people who have owned the dog, 
which had been given away at least once on Craigslist’s animal-adoption 
pages by a woman who owned the dog last year.

Police
 and much of the public had been on the hunt for the suspect since the 
female pit bull was found on August 31st close to a local playground.

Quincy,
 Massachusetts Police, the Animal Rescue League of Boston and the Office
 of the District Attorney for the Norfolk District in Massachusetts had been investigating.

'Please
 be assured that these three agencies are working in concert to identify
 and hold accountable the person or persons responsible for the torture 
of Puppy Doe,' Norfolk District Attorney 
Michael Morrissey said in a statement. 

'It is highly unlikely that this level of sadistic cruelty 
could be shown to one animal and not be part of a pattern involving 
other animals or perhaps vulnerable people.'

Animal
 rescue workers described the pit bull's injuries as the worst
 they had ever seen.

Veterinarians
 at the Animal Rescue League of Boston who treated the dog said that she
 was emaciated and weighed half of what would be expected for a two-year-old.

Sweet natured: Despite having broken bones, crushed vertebrae and other injuries, the pit bull was friendly

The pit bull had to be 
put down due to the extent of her injuries.

When she was first found it was thought that she had been hit by a car, but the true nature of her injuries soon came to light.

Vet
 Martha Smith-Blackmore was so shocked by the extent of the abuse that 
she had to walk away and give herself a break as she examined the dog's 
body.

'Her joints were pulled apart like medieval times,' she said. 'She was beaten, stabbed, burned over weeks to months and maybe her whole life. And could not walk.'

The
 vet added: 'When I saw how vulnerable she was and I understood 
immediately the duration of her suffering, my heart collapsed.'

Torture: The dog's limbs had been repeatedly pulled apart

Public outrage saw a number of tips come flooding in to help the Quincy police department in tracking the perpetrator, along with thousands of dollars that had been set aside for a reward.

The Animal Rescue League of Boston offered $5,000, followed by the California-based Animal Legal Defense League put up $2,000. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals offered up another $5,000, and Second Chance Rescue out of New York raised $11,000 for information.

The Animal Rescue League raised also raised $35,000 additionally to be put toward the investigation of this and other animal abuse cases.

The story has prompted Facebook groups that have become the sites of a tremendous outpouring of outrage and grief, and resulted in a vigil held for 'Puppy Doe.'

In pain: The dog had suffered such extensive abuse that she had to be put to sleep

Horrified: Vet Martha Blackmore-Smith says she was heart broken by the extent of abuse the dog suffered

Although there was no evidence of 
sexual interference, which the vet said can be seen in such abuse cases,
 the dog's joints had been separated from being pulled apart repeatedly.

Despite the pain and 
suffering Puppy Doe had clearly experienced in her short life, staff at 
the rescue center said she was sweet natured.

'Within
 hours of being found she had pain medication, food and love. She 
experienced some tenderness and some care at the end of her life,' Dr 
Smith-Blackmore said, adding that the dog's injuries were so severe she 
would have always been in pain if she hadn't been put down.

As well as the burn and stab marks, the dog's vertebrae had been smashed from being hit by a baseball bat or board.
