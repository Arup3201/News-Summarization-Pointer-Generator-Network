A $35 million experimental military airship was damaged Monday when part of the World War II era blimp hangar in which it is stored collapsed, causing the dirigible to spew helium.

The roof collapse was reported early this morning at the Marine Corps Air Station, a former military base in Orange County, California and a hazardous material crew rushed in to stop the leak.

The accident is a blow to the hopeful collaboration between the Department of Defense and NASA, who’ve invested heavily in the futuristic vessel because of its potential to one day carry more cargo than any other aircraft to disaster zones and military bases.

Missing: Following the roof collapse, a walkway and small tower appeared to be missing form atop the hangar (pictured)

Deflating: The innovative prototype next generation dirigible could be seen deflating in photographs after the collapse

Accident: The Aeroscraft has the military and shipping industry eager for production on the breakthrough dirigible to start, but Monday's accident will likely dampen that enthusiasm, at least temporarily

‘There's a giant hole in the roof,’ Captain Steve Concialdi of the Orange County Fire Authority said after the 7:45am collapse.

Big: After the collapse, which was reported around 7:30am Monday, a 25-foot hole could be seen in the ceiling of the 70-year-old hangar

The cause of the collapse was not known, but the partial collapse left a 25-foot by 25-foot hole in the hangar and part of the debris crashed through the 200 foot dirigible.

The dirigible is being developed by Worldwide Aeros, which says it will be capable of carrying 66 tons of cargo.

Marine Corps Air Station's Tustin Hangars were originally built in 1942 and became an historical landmark in 1978 after their role in World War II.

The hangars were also a base of operations for helicopters during the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

The military closed the station in 1999.

The groundbreaking airship, dubbed 
Aeroscraft, has had government officials and aerospace enthusiasts 
waiting anxiously for the first delivery in what has been envisioned as a
fleet of the craft—slated for as early as 2015.

The extent of damage to the vessel is
not known, but photos taken by the Orange County Register show the ship
deflating noticeably.

Worldwide
Aeros says the cargo airship's potential to carry more cargo more 
efficiently than ever before would provide the U.S. military with an 
advantage on the battlefield and greater capacity to save more lives 
during natural disasters.

Collapse: A section of a walkway on the top of the North Tustin blimp hangar appears to have collapsed damaging a 200-foot experimental zeppelin inside and causing a helium leak on Monday

Crash: A partial roof collapse on Monday left a 25-foot by 25-foot hole in the roof of the hangar and some of the debris caused a helium leak in the dirigible

Bummer: The mishap likely dampened the spirits of the Department of Defense and NASA, who've invested $35 million in the next generation zepellin for military use

The ship’s potential for super long range flights would also be a boon for the shipping industry.

There
are two versions envisioned for the ship. One model would be able to 
fly 3,567 miles on one tank of diesel and with a full cargo payload of 
66 tons. Another could carry 250 tons across 7,000 miles.

It requires only a third as much fuel
as an airplane carrying cargo, and it can take off and land anywhere 
even without a formal airstrip - including on water - making it well 
suited to war zones and disaster areas.

Worldwide
Aeros predicts that it will change the way goods are moved around the 
world by providing a mode of transport which is cheaper than planes but 
faster than ships.

Revolutionary: The $35 million airship prototype is being developed by Worldwide Aeros, a company that hopes to revolutionize how cargo is shipped around the world

New: The biggest breakthrough in the Aeroscraft is its ability to compress helium and make the ship heavier or lighter as necessary

The key technological breakthrough 
came when the firm's founder Igor Pasternak came up with a way to 
compress helium, which allows the airship to control its weight.

The Aeroscraft can take off and land vertically, like a helicopter, so it can visit destinations which do not have an airport.

Ukrainian-born founder of Worldwide Aeros, Igor Pasternak, has turned his method for compressing helium into an aerospace breakthrough.

By giving an airship the ability to become heavier and lighter when necessary, Pasternak's method allows it to stay in place while unloading cargo.

The Aeroscraft will be able to fly directly to where goods are made and transport them directly to where they need to be delivered.

The ship can take off and land vertically and without runways.

On a single tank of helium, the dirigible can travel 3,567 miles along with a full cargo load of 66 tons.

The soft, Mylar skin of the craft holds in smaller balloons of helium.

The Aeroscraft is built to military specifications, so bullets cannot pierce its shell.

Unlike balloons, though, the ship will no deflate from just one hole.

Shown here on a test flight, the Aeroscraft was slated to soon make its maiden voyage when the roof collapsed, damaging its prototype. Worldwied Aeros says its hopes to put the ships into production by 2015

The Aeroscraft was stored in a hangar at Tustin, California's Marine Corps Station when a huge chunk of the roof collapsed, damaging the dirigible.

The hangars were originally built in 1942.

They housed blimps during World War II.

During the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the hangars and station were a base for helicopters.

The station became an historic landmark in 1978.

It was closed in 1999.

This
means that even though its 115mph average speed is much slower than a 
jet at 500mph-plus, the overall travel time could be lower because it 
can travel directly from where goods are produced to where they are 
needed.

Worldwide Aeros
hopes that this will make it useful to the military and aid charities 
operating in parts of the world with poorly developed infrastructure on 
the ground.

The lighter-than-air vehicle is not a blimp because it has a rigid structure made out of ultra-light carbon fiber and aluminum underneath its high-tech Mylar skin. Inside, balloons hold the helium that gives the vehicle lift.

Unlike hydrogen, the gas used in the Hindenburg airship that crashed in 1937, helium is not flammable.

The airship can take off vertically, like a helicopter, then change its buoyancy to become heavier than air for landing and unloading.

The ship’s ballast can be controlled by the captain during drop off of cargo, which keeps the ship from tipping over.

A call to a spokesperson for Worldwide Aeros was not immediately returned.
