The Free Syrian Army has vowed revenge after Al Qaeda linked militants assassinated a top rebel commander opening up the possibility of a conflict between Western-backed rebel forces and Islamists in Syria's civil war.

The announcement is the latest sign of disarray in the armed opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has regained the upper hand more than two years into an insurgency that grew out of Arab Spring-inspired pro-democracy protests.

Members of the Islamic State of Iraq 
and the Levant, a hardline Islamist group, killed Kamal Hamami of the 
FSA Supreme Military Council on Thursday. Also known by his nom de 
guerre, Abu Bassir al-Ladkani, he is one of its top 30 figures.

Rebel commanders pledged to retaliate.

It follows growing rivalries between 
the FSA and the Islamists, who have sometimes joined forces on the 
battlefield, and coincides with attempts by the Western and Arab-backed 
FSA to allay fears any U.S.-supplied arms might reach al Qaeda.

'We
are going to wipe the floor with them. We will not let them get away 
with it because they want to target us,' a senior rebel commander said 
on condition of anonymity.

He
said the al Qaeda-linked militants had warned FSA rebels that there was
'no place' for them where Hamami was killed in Latakia province, a 
northern rural region of Syria bordering Turkey where Islamist groups 
are powerful.

Other opposition sources said the 
killing followed a dispute between Hamami's forces and the Islamic State
over control of a strategic checkpoint in Latakia and would lead to 
fighting.

The FSA has been 
trying to build a logistics network and reinforce its presence across 
Syria as the U.S. administration considers sending weapons to the group 
after concluding that Assad's forces had used chemical weapons against 
rebel fighters.

The anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict, said the FSA and the Islamic State have had violent exchanges in several areas of Syria over the past few weeks, showing growing antagonism between Assad's foes.

'Last Friday, the Islamic State killed an FSA rebel in Idlib province and cut his head off. There have been attacks in many provinces,' the Observatory's leader Rami Abdelrahman said.

Two of Hamami's men were wounded in Thursday's attack, he said by telephone.

Syria's conflict turned violent in the face of a crackdown on protests. Civil war ensued with disparate rebel groups taking up arms and the Observatory says more than 100,000 people have been killed.

U.S. congressional committees are holding up plans to arm the rebels because of fears that such deliveries will not be decisive and the arms might end up in the hands of Islamist militants.

In rebel controlled territory in northern Syria, civilians run a small arms manufacturing shop.

With the know how from reverse engineering of regime munitions and the internet, former industrial machinists have now become weapons manufacturers.

The shop, the location of which will not be given as the owner requested, has only a few lathes, mills and drill presses.

A stack of 120mm mortar rounds await collection at the Aleppo arms shop. The facility is only able to produce about 15 mortar rounds per day, rebel fighters pick up the munitions every other day to be used at the front

In large garbage bags on the floor 
inside paper sleeves sit explosive powder captured from regime forces 
used to pack shape charges and 120mm mortar rounds.

The
civilians use whatever scrap metals they can find to melt down and form
into moulded steel mortar bodies which are then precision machined 
using all manual dials and readouts.

The shop is at the mercy of those who know its location and their not speaking of it, as all fear the word of a spy or regime sympathiser.

When talk of the US arming the rebels is at a highpoint, seeing what they must rely on and their lack of mass production, one can understand their need for assistance and their frustrations from an inability to sustain a war against a superiorly armed government.
