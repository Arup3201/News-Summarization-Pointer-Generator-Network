Britain is getting happier according to a major international survey commissioned by the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD).

More than 60,000 people worldwide have completed a major interactive survey asking about the important things in life and whether they feel happy.

According to the results of the Better Life Index, the United Kingdom is the 19th happiest place to live in the world.

In 2013, the United Kingdom rated 6.8 on the OECD and has increased to 6.9 over the past twelve months

According to the OECD report: 'Happiness or subjective well-being can be measured in terms of life satisfaction, the presence of positive experiences and feelings, and the absence of negative experiences and feelings.

'Such measures, while subjective, are a useful complement to objective data to compare the quality of life across countries.'Life satisfaction measures how people evaluate their life as a whole rather than their current feelings. It captures a reflective assessment of which life circumstances and conditions are important for subjective well-being.

'When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, British people gave it a 6.9 grade, slightly higher than the OECD average of 6.6.'

According to the OECD survey, British men and women are equally happy, although in Australia, woman are happier than men while it is the opposite in Italy

According to the OECD, British people who have completed university are happier than those who have only received a primary school education.

The researchers found that there was no difference between the happiness levels of men and women.

The report found that almost three out of four British people experienced more positive experiences in an average day compared with negative experiences.

However, the positive experience figure of 74 percent is slightly below the OECD average of 76 percent.

German respondents to the survey gave general satisfaction with life a seven on the ten-point scale, ahead of the OECD average of 6.6.

In Australia, women at 7.5 are happier than the men who report a 7.2 on the scale which is still above the international average.

In Italy, men are happier than women with a score of 6.2 compared to 5.9. 

According to the OECD report: 'Money, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards.'

The OECD said the average disposable income per person in the UK is £15,253 compared to the international average of £14,137.

The researchers said: ' But there is a considerable gap between the richest and poorest – the top 20 percent of the population earn nearly six times as much as the bottom 20 percent.'

When it comes to work, more than 70 percent of those aged between 15 to 64 have paid work. UK workers, according to the survey work 1,654 hours a year - less than the OECD average of 1,765. 

The survey revealed that British people spent more on housing at 24 percent of their disposable income compared with the OECD average of 21 percent.

Despite the high costs of housing, 89 percent of respondents claim their are satisfied with their home compared with the OECD average of 87 percent. 

The report concluded: 'In the United Kingdom, the average home contains 1.9 rooms per person, more than the OECD average of 1.6 rooms per person.
