Good Morning America host Robin Roberts publicly acknowledged that she is gay on Sunday for the first time.

The 53-year-old cancer survivor thanked her girlfriend of ten years as part of a heartfelt end-of-year thank you addressed to fans and loved ones posted to her Facebook.

'I am grateful for my entire family, my long time girlfriend, Amber, and friends as we prepare to celebrate a glorious new year together,' Roberts wrote.

According to a release sent out by ABC News shortly after Roberts' sly Facebook announcement, Roberts and Laign have been together for 10 years.

The pair met through mutual friends.

The happy couple share a New York City apartment, but 39-year-old Laign is originally from the Bay Area.

Laign is a massage therapist in private practice in New York and works to help patients with injuries to recuperate.

Prior to becoming a massage therapist, a Linkedin profile shows that Laign worked in the fashion world as a sales representative at Berger and Stevens, a New York City fashion showroom.

Amber, reports Media Bistro, is Amber Laign, a message therapists who helps patients recuperate from injuries.

Roberts' sexuality has been known to her family, friends and co-workers for some time but this is the first time the television personality has spoken of that aspect of her personal life publicly.

In 2012 Roberts was diagnosed with the blood disorder myelodysplastic syndrome and took a medical leave of absence from Good Morning America.

She returned to the show in February 2013 and won a Peabody Award the same year for Robin's Journey, a series of TV reports that chronicled her battle against MDS.

Five years earlier she had been treated for breast cancer.

In the mean time, her letter of gratitude appears at a time when Roberts has quite a bit to be thankful for.

According to the New York Post, the Good Morning America darling inked a new long-term deal with ABC for a reported $10 million and $14 million.

ABC News released this statement shortly after Roberts' post appeared on Facebook:

'We
 love Robin and Amber, who we have all known for a long time. We were so
 touched by her Facebook message today and so thankful for all the 
loving support she has in her life.'

Roberts is currently writing a memoir
 about her health struggles and the lessons she learned from them. The 
book is due to be published in April by Grand Central Publishing, a 
division of Hachette Book Group.

It remains to be seen whether Roberts will discuss her relationship or sexuality in the book.

'On
 this last Sunday of 2013 I encourage you to reflect on what you are 
grateful for too,' she writes in today's post. 'Wishing you a Healthy 
and Happy New Year.'

100 days after transplant: Roberts posted this photo of herself reuniting with her beloved dog KJ in 2012 along with her gratitude letter on Facebook

Flashback 12/29/12....Hard to believe this was 1 year ago today..when I reached a critical milestone of 100 days post transplant...and KJ was finally allowed to come back home.

Reading this comforts me and I hope the same for you: 'If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the present.'

At this moment I am at peace and filled with joy and gratitude.

I am grateful to God, my doctors and nurses for my restored good health.

I am grateful for my sister, Sally-Ann, for being my donor and giving me the gift of life.

I am grateful for my entire family, my long time girlfriend, Amber, and friends as we prepare to celebrate a glorious new year together.

I am grateful for the many prayers and well wishes for my recovery. I return every one of them to you 100 fold.

On this last Sunday of 2013 I encourage you to reflect on what you are grateful for too.

Wishing you a Healthy and Happy New Year.

Peace, love, and blessings to all..XO
