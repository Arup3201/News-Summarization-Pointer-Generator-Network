Robin van Persie admitted his late equaliser against Chelsea had felt like a winner.

United looked set to lose to Didier Drogba's header - deflected in off Van Persie - until the striker rammed in following Marouane Fellaini's saved header, earning a 1-1 draw.

The goal sparked jubilant scenes at Old Trafford and Van Persie told Sky Sports 1: 'In the 93rd minute, 1-0 down at home, it feels so much better as you can see. Overall we had more chances than them, although it's a fair results. I have mixed feelings.

'I had two early chances when (Thibaut Courtois) made a good save with a blocked shot, and in the second half as well late in the game. I always kept thinking positive, going for the next chance and it fell to my feet.'

Fellaini's header came when he was not marked by Branislav Ivanovic - the Chelsea defender who was sent off seconds before.

'Is that so? It makes it even better for us,' Van Persie added.

'If you come back in a game like this, the fact is we were 1-0 down and it gives us a boost. If you look at the table we should have won, wanted to win to get the points but we can be happy with a draw.'

Asked if United can catch Chelsea, who remain the league leaders, he added: 'Of course we can, there's a long way to go, nine, 10 games played and it's not even halfway.

'In my opinion we are better every day. In training and if you look at games you can see we are comfy on the ball and we are playing better. Now we have to stretch games longer. We extended that into the hour and we try to aim to play like that for an hour and a half.'

Meanwhile, manager Louis van Gaal was pleased with the last-gasp equaliser and also believes the Red Devils are moving in the right direction.

'I think we deserved the equaliser, but I think we could have won today,' said the Manchester United boss. 

'Nearly every game I am saying this, but it is a good sign I think as Chelsea are top level, and we were at least equal today.

'I think we are showing again that we are believing until the end that we can score in spite of if a result is bad.

'It was the same against West Brom (2-1 down), the players are giving everything for me and that was the most pleasing thing I saw today.

'We could have won, but nevertheless we don't win but that's our fault. When you can do that against the best team in this league at this moment it's a good sign.'
