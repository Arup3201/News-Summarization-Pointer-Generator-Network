Tottenham kicked off their summer tour of America and Canada with a 3-3 draw against MLS side Seattle Sounders on Saturday evening.

In a game which saw three penalties at Century Link Field, Spurs twice came from behind in Mauricio Pochettino's first game in charge of the club as Spanish duo Roberto Soldado and Iago Falque scored from the spot having come on from the bench.

Lewis Holtby, who spent part of last season on loan at Fulham but started for the north London club, opened the scoring with his head after latching onto Harry Kane's left-wing cross on ten minutes.

However, the Barclays Premier League side were pegged back after half an hour as Seattle midfielder Gonzalo Pineda equalised with a penalty following Michael Dawson's foul on Chad Marshall in the area.

Osvaldo Alonso fired Seattle into the lead three minutes into the second half as the midfielder's thunderous effort crashed in off the underside of the bar.

Spurs replied five minutes later through Soldado's well-taken penalty before Seattle took the lead once more through Tristan Bowen who tapped home Sean Okoli's cross with his first touch of the game.

However, Tottenham avoided defeat as Iago Falque, who spent last season on loan at Rayo Vallecano, scored from the penalty spot having won the spot-kick after kicking the ball against the hand of Seattle defender DeAndre Yeldin.

Following kick-off at the start of the game, the Tottenham defence and midfield purposely parted to allow 18-year-old Xander Bailey an effort on goal.

The youngster, who has cystic fibrosis, was given the chance to sign for the Sounders thanks to the 'Make-A-Wish' foundation and took a shot at Spurs goalkeeper Brad Friedel before leaving the field to rapturous applause.

Former Spurs frontman Clint Dempsey played up front for the Sounders alongside ex-Newcastle and Inter Milan striker Obafemi Martins.

Next up for Tottenham is Toronto on Wednesday where the White Hart Lane club will come up against former frontman Jermain Defoe.
