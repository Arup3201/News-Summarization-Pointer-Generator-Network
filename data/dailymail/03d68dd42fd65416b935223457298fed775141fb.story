Almost half of all TV programmes shown on the four main channels during Christmas week will be repeats.

During the festive period, viewers can expect an experience of deja vu as they’re faced with a re-run of vintage shows such as Only Fools And Horses, The Vicar Of Dibley and Dad’s Army.

The worst offender is BBC2 – with eight out of ten programmes being repeats.

Vintage viewing: Dad's Army is one of the TV programmes which will be re-run during the festive period

Meanwhile, those expecting blockbuster film premieres will be left disappointed as three-quarters of all the films being broadcast have been shown before.

With more than 98 films hitting the screens, only 23 are network premieres, whereas 75 (77 per cent) are old.

Among the selection of tried and tested family films are Toy Story, Wallace And Gromit: The Wrong Trousers, Gremlins, Singin’ In The Rain and A Christmas Carol.

Worst offender: Re-runs of The Vicar of Dibley will also be played. The worst offender is BBC2, with eight out of ten programmes being repeats

Research on the long-awaited Christmas TV schedule conducted by the Mail shows that from Saturday, December 22, to Friday, December 28, 49 per cent of all programmes are repeats on the four main terrestrial  channels – BBC1, BBC2, ITV1 and Channel 4. The channel with the most new shows is BBC1, with 18 per cent of the 172 programmes being repeats.

For ITV1, a third of all their shows are repeats, followed by  60 per cent for Channel 4.

But out of the 155 programmes on BBC2, some 127 are recycled Christmas offerings.

There are growing concerns that broadcasters are failing to offer enough variety during the festive period.

In terms of film premieres, ITV1 has the least with only two out of 22 on offer, these being Tangled and Couples Retreat on Christmas Day.

Channel 4 has the most with nine out of its 27 films, including all of the Swedish Millennium trilogy – The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets’ Nest.

A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘In peak time on BBC1 over 90 per cent of programmes have never been seen before, including Christmas specials for Doctor Who, Call The Midwife, Mrs Brown’s Boys, The Royle Family and Miranda.

‘In addition to a wide range of brand-new programmes on BBC2, many of its repeats are of classic shows including Morecambe And Wise, Victoria Wood, Blackadder, and a tribute to Ronnie Barker.’
