It was Jennifer Lopez who really pushed me over the edge. I mean if there is a better looking example of a 45 year old woman out there, I'd really love to see it. 

Her new video for Booty is probably the raciest she's ever done in her entire career– and she looks better than ever before. 

Yes Jennifer's workouts are full of all kinds of complicated Tracy Anderson dancing routines, but she's been dancing all her life. 

Jennifer Lopez puts her recent weight loss down to converting to a vegan diet

What is new however, is her diet. A few months ago she went VEGAN and has never looked back. Actually Jen is just the latest celebrity to embrace what is quickly becoming Hollywood's hottest eating plan.

We all saw the pictures of Beyonce and Jay Z coming out of Vegan restaurants right after the birth of Blue, in fact Beyonce credits veganism with helping her shed 60 pounds of pregnancy weight. 

Jennifer appeared on the cover of US Weekly having lost 10 pounds in a 22 day cleanse

Despite her allegiance to Weight Watchers, Jessica Simpson turned to veganism to drop weight on the eve of her wedding. Other long-time vegans include Natalie Portman, Carrie Underwood, Russell Brand and Demi Moore. Even the world's hottest new husband, 50 year old Brad Pitt is vegan.

It's catching on in the UK. At the moment current estimates are that there are around 150,000 Vegans in the UK and in 2013 40% more tried Veganism than the year previously.

In fact, it's this diet that JLO credits with helping her shed the 10 pounds that had been sticking to her since the birth of her twins six years ago. Thus, with two stone still sticking to me after the birth of my baby 15 months ago, I decided to try to copy this ultra sexy mother of two.

I'll be honest. The first day at Sainsbury's was a complete nightmare. I cannot handle salads all the time and found trying to meal plan infuriating. 

Ashley opted for a vegan diet delivery service from My FOOD

Ashley says that she lost 5 pounds almost immediately with the diet service, dishes include sun-dried tomato soup (left) and Thai red curry (right) 

Ensuring that I was getting the right nutrition after cutting out all animal products is challenging, and trying to come up with ideas for meals that actually sound edible to say the least. I'm not a huge fan of the vegetable, I'll just put that out there now. It's probably part of why I still have so much weight to lose.

Not only that, but if you Google Vegan Diets you can find all kinds of experts out there saying that they are a truly horrible idea and bad for your health. It's pretty discouraging. Studies have shown that vegans are often low in vitamins D, B12 and iron for starters. 

In short, cutting out all dairy, eggs and meat means it takes a rather creative type who also happens to have the time to shop for produce, frequently; neither one of which applies to me.

Henrietta Norton co-founder of food-state brand Wild Nutrition says, that actually there are pros and cons. 'A healthy vegan diet is a diet plentiful in vegetables and pulses, making it naturally lower processed foods, adulterated fats and higher fibre diet which can support a healthy weight.' 

She adds, however that. 'like any other dietary regime a vegan diet can easily be unhealthily too if based too much on processed or too many grains, which can lead to weight gain if not eaten in moderation. 

Ashley Pearson tried the vegan craze in an attempt to achieve JLO's amazing post baby bod

'Any diet where significant food groups are avoided, you run the risk of limiting your intake of key macro and micro nutrients such as B12, iron, chromium and protein, all of which play a fundamental role in metabolism and can therefore reduce your body's ability to burn 'fuel', leading to weight gain and blood sugar imbalance.'

It's tricky to get it right.

Two things, in addition to JLO's bottom pushed me to give it a shot.

One was a recent study funded by the National Cancer Institute which showed that vegans have significantly lower rates of cancer than both meat-eaters and vegetarians. Vegan women, for example, had 34 per cent lower rates of female-specific cancers such as breast, cervical, and ovarian cancer. The way they tested it was interesting. 

A series of experiments was performed in which people were placed on different diets and their blood was then dripped on human cancer cells growing in a petri dish. Women on a vegan diet for just two weeks were found to suppress the growth of three different types of breast cancer. 

It's believed that it had something to do with changes in the level of a cancer-promoting growth hormone in the body called IGF-1. Animal protein intake increases levels but a plant-based diet cause them to drop.

Then there was a study done by prominent US physicians Drs. Dean Ornish and Nobel Prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn; they found that a vegan diet caused more than 500 genes to change in only three months, turning on genes that prevent disease and turning off genes that cause breast cancer, heart disease, prostate cancer, and other illnesses.

So there was evidence that indicated I was on a good, healthy track for myself.

Then came the Lazy Vegan solution – or the 'Hollywood At Home' plan. The first week my efforts varied from carb heavy meals – most store bought pasta is made without egg and thus OK - to boring green salads with slimey looking tofu. 

I was this close to giving up when a friend of mine recommended trying a vegan meal delivery service – just until I got the hang of things. 

I used MyFOOD (www.myfood.co.uk) and my desperate palate was transformed with Thai curries, cashew nut paella, vegan 'sushi', tofu Tikki Masala, and spelt pizzas. It illustrated that you can have delicious vegan food if you know what you're doing.

In the UK Vegan diet delivery services are becoming more and more readily available.

My FOOD founder Nas Amir-Ahmadi says, 'We have a variety of plans available but recently have been inundated with requests to put together a vegan plan. Doing it this way takes away some of the fear of not getting enough vitamins and at the same time, shows that you can eat really delicious food – it's not just all green salads all the time.'

I lost 5 pounds almost immediately although in the weeks following it's been more gradual. What I have noticed though is that I feel better, I have fewer cravings for sugar and carbs and find that I am actually eating more carbs than usual but still losing weight.

 I feel good. And so does Jennifer Lopez. The still stunning star says she followed a 100% vegan diet for five weeks and felt incredible. 'It was a real change,' she said. 'I felt better and people were like, 'Your energy's better. The truth is, even if you're 70-80 percent vegan, it's so much better having those vegetables, greens, and plant-based stuff,' said Jennifer. 'It's going to change your life and health.'
