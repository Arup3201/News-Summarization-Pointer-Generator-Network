Sometimes it can be a lonely existence in goal and Jan Alnwick found his north London baptism no less brutal at one end of the Seven Sisters Road than it was at the other.

Having conceded four in a blur at Arsenal on Saturday and it somehow got worse for Newcastle's rookie keeper as he conceded four more at Tottenham.

He made a dreadful error for the first, dropping the ball from a corner, which allowed Nabil Bentaleb to put Spurs in control of this Capital One Cup quarter-final.

Alan Pardew tried hard not to criticise Alnwick but confessed games swung on moments like that.

Thirty-four seconds into the second half, Nacer Chadli had lashed in another, this time a crisp strike, arrowed skilfully into the bottom corner.

Harry Kane added the third, his 12th of the season, before he was replaced by Roberto Soldado, who pounced for the fourth when Alnwick was unable to hold a routine drive by Christian Eriksen.

By the end, it seemed too cruel and, although Soldado needs confidence boosting after his own goal-issues, even the home fans seemed slightly relieved when Alnwick saved from the Spain international near the end.

By this point, Tottenham's place in the last four was beyond doubt, Mauricio Pochettino had relaxed on the touchline and the 'Spurs are on their way to Wembley' songs were cautiously aired.

Perhaps they were sung with more gusto once the semi-final draw paired them with Sheffield United of League One, although Pochettino seemed unsure which team from Sheffield stood between him and his first appearance at Wembley.

For Newcastle, however, another competition slips by and the long quest for silver goes on, and Pardew's most pressing issue as he returns to Tyneside is how to stop this goalkeeping crisis wrecking what was a promising campaign.

Tim Krul and Rob Elliot are injured – out until mid-January - and Karl Darlow is on loan for the season at Nottingham Forest, with no recall clause.

Alnwick faces a genuine test of his mental strength if there is no help forthcoming from the Barclays Premier League, who have the facility to grant special permission for clubs to make emergency loan signings outside the transfer windows.

This seemed to be on Pardew's mind as he made the most of his goalkeeper's shoulder injury through the closing minutes of the game.

Alnwick had treatment once and then, when there was another break in play for Mousa Dembele to receive attention, the Newcastle boss nudged his physio to run on again, to check-out the young 'keeper.

It is easy to understand Pardew's fears. His only alternative is Freddie Woodman, who is 17 and has even less experience. 'There's no way our 17-year-old should be forced in at this level,' said the Newcastle boss.

True, these extreme experiences can build character, but they can also scar young footballers and no-one wants to see Alnwick, who is out of contract at the end of the season, suffer like this.

How will he feel in Sunday’s derby, knowing Sunderland will target him? Manchester United will do the same at Old Trafford on Boxing Day.

Spurs did it last night, peppering his goal from distance across a slick surface.

Alnwick, on only his second senior start, made a solid save to thwart Chadli who had been released by a disguised pass from Andros Townsend.

But the mistake which triggered the slide out of the Capital One Cup was totally unforced.

Alnwick was all alone as he jumped to catch Eriksen’s high corner kick, only for the ball to slither from his grasp and spill at the feet of Bentaleb, who forced it over the line for his first Tottenham goal.

Newcastle had conceded after 18 minutes, just as they had at White Hart Lane in October.

Spurs should probably have been awarded a penalty when Kane was tripped by Fabricio Coloccini before half-time, but referee Andre Marriner waved play on.

The decision did not influence the result which is a lucky break for Marriner who was heavily criticised for a penalty he awarded to Manchester City in a 1-0 win against Everton, and then found his next appearance to be at Fleetwood, in League One.

Newcastle rallied briefly, after going behind, with Michel Vorm keeping out two fierce strikes from the impressive Moussa Sissoko before the break while Emmnuel Riviere and Yoan Gouffran wasted clear opportunities to equalise.

While Newcastle’s goalkeeper squirmed in the spotlight, their strikers were in no mood to spare his embarrassment.

Even at 2-0 down, there was a glimpse of an escape but Remy Cabella and Riviere somehow contrived to miss a sitter created by Ayoze Perez.

With not a defender in the frame, Cabella was first to the cross at the near-post but his contact was so thin he glanced it away from his team-mate and it flashed wide at the far-post.

The White Hart Lane fight-back in October was inspired by Sammy Ameobi’s goal, six seconds into the second half, but this time it was Tottenham who came flying out of the interval.

Chadli struck after 34 seconds, cutting across the pitch from left-to-right before unleashing a sweet drive inside the post from just outside the penalty box.

Pardew claimed Alnwick would have saved it had it not clipped Fabricio Coloccini’s heel on the way.

The goalkeeper did make a decent save from Vlad Chiriches and Massadio Haidara cleared off the line from Jan Vertonghen’s header before Kane and Soldado piled on the misery and Tottenham started to dream of Wembley.
