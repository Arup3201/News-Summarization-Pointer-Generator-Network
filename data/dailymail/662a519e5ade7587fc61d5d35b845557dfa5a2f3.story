There are few hotels with such a rich and colourful history as Raffles Hotel in Singapore. 

Built in 1887 it had the lethal combination of elegance, style and sophistication as well as knowing how to throw a rip roaring party.

Upper class British colonials scrambled to stay in its rooms, dine in the restaurant or take a turn around its exotic palm lined gardens.

It made a corner of Asia accessible and friendly; a familiar bolt hole in an unfamiliar country.

When it opened on 1 December 1887 the hotel had just 10 rooms and was a bungalow-style building overlooking the beach and the South China Sea.

The property at 1 Beach Road was leased from its wealthy Arab owner to the Armenian Sarkies brothers, Tigran, Aviet and Arshak who transformed it from beach front home to hotel. In 1890 a pair of two storey wings with 22 new suites were added.

The hotelier family enlisted the help of R. A. J Bidwell from the architecture firm Swan & Maclaren to build the main building in 1899.

With names like Somerset Maugham, Noel Coward, Rudyard Kipling, Joseph Conrad and Charlie Chaplin checking in over the following decades Raffles’ reputation grew.

Perhaps the most famous story however comes from 1902 when a tiger apparently infiltrated the billiard room of the hotel. 

A man was dispatched to shoot the animal – thought to have escaped from a local circus – and life continued as usual.

Years later, according to hotel legend, the head bartender Ngiam Tong Boon invented the Singapore Sling in the Long Bar in 1915.

Though recipes today vary the pink drink traditionally contains a sling of gin, a hit of cherry brandy and dashes of lime and pineapple juice as well as Cointreau and the herbal liqueur Benedictine.

Thousands of tourists make the spiritual pilgrimage to the drinks’ home and order one from the infamous 1920s themed Long Bar, still there today.

Another important Raffles resident was Doris Geddes, an Australian who had a couture shop named Little Shop in the hotel for 30 years from 1947.

She once dressed Elizabeth Taylor in 1957, although apparently the garment was deemed too tight by the formidable actress.

In a letter on display in the museum Geddes once wrote of the hotel, ‘Noel Coward used to drop in with his four friends. He loved that very English undercurrent of nonsense that was always going on.’

If you chose to visit, 12 out of 103 of the suites are named after famous actors and writers who most loved the hotel or were associated with it during its heyday.

The Chaplin suite has a sepia photograph of the comedian dining with his brother in 1933 on the wall. It was taken by a Japanese photographer named S Nakajima, whose studio was for a number of years housed in Raffle’s Bras Basah Wing.

Ava Garder, roundly considered one of the most beautiful actresses of her age, visited in the mid-1950s for the Asian premier of her film ‘The Barefoot Contessa’. 

There are pictures of her visit on display in her suite and you can request to watch the film as reception holds a copy.

The British playwright Noel Coward first stayed in Raffles in 1931 and remained a loyal guest until his last visit in 1968. 

He completed the play ‘Private Lives’ on his first visit to Singapore, staying for a month at the hotel and recalled in his autobiography sipping a Gin Sling on the veranda.

With such an illustrious list of visitors it is unsurprising that the brand has extended across the globe.

Today its property portfolio includes spots in Dubai, Seychelles, Cambodia, Paris, Beijing, Hainan, Makati and Makkah.
