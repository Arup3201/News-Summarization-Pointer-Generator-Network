Opinion: Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper

Hollywood actors continue to fire Twitter salvos at each other over actor Seth Rogen’s controversial tweet about movie American Sniper, based on Navy SEAL Chris Kyle’s experiences in Iraq.

He wrote that the movie reminded him of a Nazi propaganda film about a sniper that appeared in Quentin Tarantino’s acclaimed Inglorious Basterds.

Such is the furore surrounding the tweet that he felt obliged to further clarify his comments with another tweet underlining that he has nothing against war veterans and was not comparing the movie to Nazi propaganda.

Now Alec Baldwin has leapt to the defence of the Neighbors actor, after Dean Cain weighed in with a tweet claiming that he had no right to make the comment in the original tweet because he’d never fought in a war.

Cain, known for his role as Superman, wrote: ‘Seth... I like your films, but right now, I wanna kick your ass. Chris is an American Hero. Period. Go to war. Then we'll talk.’

However, Baldwin retorted: ‘Did @RealDeanCain threaten Seth Rogen? And isn't that the same kind of troubled thinking that got Chris Kyle killed?’

The Clint Eastwood film is a profile of Kyle, who was described as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history.

While critical reviews have been generally positive and the movie has been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor, it has also drawn fire for being jingoistic or propaganda for the U.S. military.

Filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II.

Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.'

Moore later backtracked those comments on Facebook, writing that he thought the film was well made but could have done a better job at contextualizing the Iraq War.

Rogen has now also sought to calm the Twitter storm down with another explanation of his tweet sent on January 19 that referenced the Nazi sniper.

He wrote: ‘It appears I need to further clarify a tweet I sent a few days ago. I said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie. I didn't compare the two at all. I merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other, because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers.

This is what I really meant: Seth Rogen went online to clarify the difference between 'kinda reminded me' and a direct comparison. He used apples and oranges as an example

‘People then claimed that I compared the movie American Sniper to Nazi propaganda, something I would never do (I've already publicly explained that I enjoyed American Sniper) and also implied that I somehow have something against Chris Kyle and veterans in general, neither of which are true in the least.

‘My grandfather was a veteran. My comment about the movie was not meant to have any political implications. Any political meaning was ascribed to my comment by news commentary. I'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone, but that was not my intention. I hope this clears things up.’

This follows an earlier attempt at clarification.

Rogen insisted on that occasion as well that he wasn't comparing American Sniper with the parody vignette in Inglorious Basterds, but was saying that one reminded him of the other.

He tweeted: ‘Apples remind me of oranges. Can't compare them though.'

Rogen, 32, then threw in a small dig at the media, accusing the press of blowing his opinions 'out of proportion'. The Interview star wrote that he is happy to keep the fires burning on the controversy.

Quentin Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds culminates with an assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called 'Stolz der Nation' which translates to Nation's Pride.

One of the characters of the film is a haughty German soldier who plays himself in Nation's Pride, a movie about how he killed 200 Allied soldiers from a clock tower in one battle.

Controversy: Rogen said American Sniper (still on the right) reminded him of Nation's Pride (still on the left), a fake Nazi propaganda film from Quentin Tarantino's World War II film Inglorious Basterds

True story: American Sniper is based on Chris Kyle's memoir, which was written before his tragic death in February 2013 at a shooting range

American Sniper on the other hand stars Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the real-life man who became the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, saving hundreds of American lives with at least 160 kills.

The film, based on Kyle's memoir, ends with his tragic death in Texas, allegedly at the hands of a fellow soldier with PTSD he was trying to help.

Kid Rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by Rogen and Moore, tweeting: ‘: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon.

'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.'

American Sniper,  directed by Clint Eastwood, raked in $105.3million during its opening weekend in America.
