Holidaymakers in Majorca will be fined £500 if they dare to walk the streets in just their bikinis or trunks.

Island authorities have implemented a ban on wearing bathing costumes away from the beach or poolside.

The new regulations come in this month after workers in bars, restaurants and shops complained that they were fed up with having to serve under-dressed holidaymakers.

Palma city council’s ‘Ordenanza Civica’, otherwise known as the Good Citizen Plan, is aimed at both tourists and locals.

Under a section titled ‘Etiquette’, it says anyone ‘devoid of superior parts of clothing’ in roads not immediately adjacent to the beach will be fined.

Other proposals also include the banning of glass bottles from the beach and fining cyclists who use the pavement.

The city’s deputy mayor Alvaro Gijon said the swimwear ban was meant to preserve ‘harmony and civility’.

He added that he did not know ‘of any upscale resort town’ that allows the practice of wearing swimwear in public.

The rules are the latest developments in Majorca – long the destination for millions of British holidaymakers – aimed at making the island more upmarket.

Last year officials introduced a ban on drinking alcohol in public, and Mr Gijon said he wanted to transform Majorca’s image by upgrading hotels and restaurants.

Anyone 'devoid of superior parts of clothing' in roads not immediately adjacent to the beach will be fined by local authorities as part of the new rules which are aimed at making the island more upmarket

He also said he wanted to target the four-mile Playa de Palma strip just outside the capital, banning drinking there and turning it into a destination for gastronomy and sports facilities rather than drinking buckets of sangria on sun loungers.

Elsewhere in Spain, a similar bikini-ban was introduced in Barcelona in 2011, aimed at tourists who wander off the beach and onto the streets in bikinis and trunks.

The city hall voted to ban ‘nudity or virtual nudity in public places’ and limit swimwear to swimming pools, beaches, adjacent roads and beach walks.

Those who flout the ban are fined up to £245 (300 euros), while nudists face an even tougher fine of up to £408 (500 euros).

In Italy two seaside towns also introduced fines penalising those who flash too much flesh. In Vietri Sul mare and Castellammare di Stabia, both in the Campania region of Southern Italy, the town mayors passed bans on ‘very skimpy clothes’ in 2010.

Anyone deemed showing an unreasonable amount of bare skin on streets and in public spaces faces a fine of up to £408 (500 euros) – essential for upholding ‘the area’s image’, according to one town spokesman.
