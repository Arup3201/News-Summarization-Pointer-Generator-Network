A spurned lover has been convicted of assaulting her partner - by biting his penis during a row.

Sinead Walker, 40, had gone to her ex-partner Vincent Rennoldson’s flat in Bath, Somerset, to apologise for an earlier argument during which she had assaulted him.

But when Mr Rennoldson, 42, asked her to leave, she became abusive and lashed out at him, at which point he dialled 999.

While he was on the phone, the mother-of-one - who had consumed an entire bottle of wine - pulled down his boxer shorts, grabbed his penis, tried to tear it off - and then bit it.

When Vincent Rennoldson's ex-partner attacked him, he called the police - who heard his screams as his jilted lover tried to bite his penis off

Mr Rennoldson was assaulted by his ex-girlfriend, Sinead Walker, 40 (right). The mother 
of one had drunk an entire bottle of wine before visiting him at his 
flat to apologise for a previous row but she then turned violent

Walker claimed that the wound was the result of vigorous love-making but
 Mr Rennoldson's spine-chilling screams were overheard by an emergency 
operator during the attack.

She was found guilty of assault on Monday after her ex-partner told a court his genitalia had been left permanently scarred.

The
 father-of-three, speaking after the case, said: 'It was horrific - she 
came around to say sorry and ended up trying to bite my penis off.

'She was on her knees, got it in her hands and just started biting. I just screamed - the pain was excruciating.

'There was a lot of blood and it was painful for weeks afterwards. I now have a three-inch scar on the bottom of my willy.

'It has affected me - I was watching 
Jaws the other night but had to turn over. If you hit or kick someone 
that’s one thing - but biting them down there is another thing.

'It could have been worse - she could have bitten it off. At least it still works.'

Bath
 Magistrates' Court was told that trouble between the pair, who had been
 dating for ten months, first flared on December 14 last year.

Jill
 MacNamara, prosecuting, said Walker had downed several pints of cider 
before flying into a rage and snarling: 'What’s your f***ing problem?'.

Walker then punched and kicked her partner after he refused to let her leave his flat until police arrived.

Mr Rennoldson could be heard saying 'she’s giving me a kicking' on a frantic 999 call played to the court.

Two
 weeks later, on December 28, Walker - on bail accused of the first 
assault - returned to his flat with friends to apologise over drinks.

But the jobless mother, who was drunk, again began directing abuse at her former partner, at around 5pm.

She then lashed out with her fists when he asked her and a friend to get out.

Mr
 Rennoldson, choking back the tears, described how she then pulled down 
his boxer shorts and bit his penis while he was on the phone to the 
police.

He told the court: 'She pushed me against the wall in the hallway and pulled my boxer shorts down.

'She grabbed my penis and tried to pull it off. She was on the floor - then she bit it.

'I have now got a scar on it - I will show anybody. She tried to bite my penis off.'

Walker left the flat shortly afterwards, but was later arrested.

Pictures of bruises and scratches to his upper arms, neck and elbow from the attack - as well as the genital injury - were shown to magistrates.

The former shop fitter’s screams - as Walker bit down on him - were also played to the court from his 999 call.

Ms MacNamara said: 'You can hear him 
under attack. That is the best version of events he can give to what 
happened - what he was saying at the time.'

Walker, from Bath, denied two counts of common assault over the December 14 and December 28 attacks.

She claimed she caused some of the injuries to Mr Rennoldson in self-defence, while trying to fight her way out of the flat.

But she insisted she had not bitten his penis.

Erinna Foley-Fisher, defending, said: 'The defendant has done her best to account for his injuries - saying they could have happened during sexual intercourse.'

But magistrates took less than an hour to find her guilty on both counts of assault.

Gail Bragg, chair of the bench, said: 'We find Mr Rennoldson’s injuries are consistent with the 999 calls and the photographs.

'We do not accept Ms Walker’s claims that it was self-defence.'

Walker, who has no previous convictions, was released on bail before sentencing at the same court on May 8, on the condition she did not contact her former partner.

She did not comment on leaving court.
