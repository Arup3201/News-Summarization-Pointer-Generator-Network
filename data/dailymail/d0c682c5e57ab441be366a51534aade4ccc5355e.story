The surroundings may be different, but the goal is the same for Ndamukong Suh.

The Detroit Lions defensive tackle wants the team to continue their strong start to the season and move to 6-2 with victory over the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley on Saturday.

Detroit landed in London on the back of a 24-23 win over the New Orleans Saints and atop a competitive NFC North ahead of the Green Bay Packers.

'It has been a tough first half of the season so far,' Suh told Sportsmail. 'Our goal at this moment is to go to 6-2, go into our bye week, rest up and come back out stronger.'

The Lions have made a seamless transition from former head coach Jim Schwartz to Jim Caldwell and find themselves well placed for a run at the post-season.

But last season, Detroit were similarly well placed. They entered their bye week at 5-3 and followed up with a narrow win at the Chicago Bears to strengthen their hold on the division.

A 40-10 Thanksgiving day thrashing of Green Bay had the Lions in control of the NFC North, but that was their only win in their last seven games. Detroit finished 7-9 with four straight defeats and third behind the Packers and Bears. 

'The switch from coach Schwartz to coach Caldwell has been good,' Suh said. 'Coach Caldwell is very transparent and understands what he needs from you as a player and a very open communicator. 

'He is a guy I have grown to like as I have got to know him more and more and is good for Detroit.

'It was tough last year to see that all unfold the way it did. There were a lot of things we know we could have done better. Unfortunately that's the way the ball fell and we were outside the playoffs and couldn't find a way to get in. 

'It is something that I have personally forgotten and moved past. This is a new season and we are off to a fairly decent start and hope to finish the first half on a really good note.

'It's always best to learn from your own mistakes and not let them repeat themselves. A lot of guys who were there last year and took part in that will understand that if it starts to creep up again we will find a way to combat it.'

Suh is into his fifth season in the NFL and part of a fearsome Lions defense - the best in the league after seven weeks. The defensive tackle seems to have moved on from his disciplinary problems (he was fined three times in three months last season) with attention now on his performances.   

'I don't think the fines and the negative connotations have held me back from developing,' he said. 'I think just from an imagery standpoint, people understanding who I am is overshadowed.

'But that's just the way the world works – negativity sells. I don't really worry about it. I understand who I am as a person and have a strong group behind me. Day in and day out they take care of me. I have been fortunate this year, playing at a high level and just flying under the radar.

'Over the last four or five years I have developed the skills to put me up there among the best defensive tackles in the league right now. I think there's a lot of room for improvement each and every year. 

'As a young pro becoming a veteran I think I'm on my way to doing pretty well but still have room for growth.' 

Ndamukong Suh, Steven Jackson and Joey Barton were at NikeTown London as part of the 'Suit up for Sunday' campaign and ahead of the second 2014 NFL International Series game. This Sunday the Atlanta Falcons will take on the Detroit Lions at Wembley Stadium.
