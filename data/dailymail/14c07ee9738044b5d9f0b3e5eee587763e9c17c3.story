Buying petrol used to be a simple process of filling up your tank, paying the cashier and driving away.

But it is set to become the latest shopping experience to bombard customers with a marketing ploy – by scanning their faces.

Tesco is to use facial recognition technology to target advertising to each customer queuing at  their tills.

Technology: Tesco is to use facial recognition devices to target advertising to customers queuing at their petrol stations

The devices – reminiscent of those seen in the science-fiction film Minority Report – will be rolled out at the supermarket’s petrol stations.

Drivers’ ages and genders will be captured allowing the hi-tech screens to display adverts best suited to them.

The OptimEyes scanners – developed by Lord Sugar’s company Amscreen, which is run by his eldest son Simon – will also use information such as the date, location and time to adjust which adverts are used.

Each screen is fitted with an inbuilt camera which can automatically detect patterns and is programmed to recognise the human face.

Life imitates art: The scanners echo the 2002 Hollywood blockbuster Minority Report, in which Tom Cruise¿s character is bombarded with advertising specifically designed for him

The system also has hundreds of visual characteristics stored, such as areas of shadow, logged as  ‘dark zones’, and distances between facial features. The ‘dark zones’ detected to the left and right of a chin, for example, signify long hair.

A combination of these different ‘variables’ dictates whether the system identifies the customer as male or a female and within a certain age category.

This is the first time the technology is being used in the UK.

Amscreen already has contracts to display screen adverts in shops, banks, hospitals and doctors’ surgeries, but these do not use facial scanning technology that tailors the adverts to the people looking at the screen. 

The scanners echo the 2002 Hollywood blockbuster Minority Report, in which Tom Cruise’s character is bombarded with advertising specifically designed for him.

Amscreen boss Simon Sugar said admitted that the device seemed like something from science fiction.

‘Yes, it’s like something out of Minority Report, but this could change the face of British retail and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible,’ he said. 

He insisted the technology does not store images or recognise individual people, but simply ‘works out gender and sorts customers into one of three age brackets’.

The adverts will run for up to  ten seconds each, on a loop of  100 seconds. 

Mr Sugar added: ‘We’re extremely excited to call Tesco a screen network partner. We believe it’s our flexibility, reliability and measurability that has helped us secure this partnership. 

‘For potential advertisers, this means we can now offer various digital advertising solutions to reach the sought-after Tesco shopper.’

The retail giant said the advertising platform would reach more than five million adult customers every week. 

Peter Cattell, a director for  Tesco petrol stations said: ‘We’re always looking to work with partners who provide innovative ways to enhance the customer shopping experience. 

‘This new dynamic screen product from Amscreen provides the perfect means for us to do this. 

‘The ability to tailor content based on time and location means it can be extremely useful and timely for our customers.’
