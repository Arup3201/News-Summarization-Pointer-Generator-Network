Some of Britain’s biggest sporting events could disappear from the BBC unless the corporation cleans up its act.

Ministers have been urged to consider handing the slice of the licence fee used to buy up events like Wimbledon and the FA cup to rival broadcasters.

It is suggested that while the so-called Crown Jewels events in the sorting calendar should be on free-to-view channels, the BBC should not automatically receive the funding to air them.

The move marks a significant escalation in the row between the BBC and the government, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall sex abuse scandals and public outrage at huge payoffs to BBC managers.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps warned at the weekend that television licence fee could be cut unless the BBC tackles a 'culture' of secrecy, waste and bias.

But the aggressive approach could go further, with ministers looking at breaking the link between the BBC and licence fee itself.

Every year the Corporation spends 
£150million buying the rights to major sporting events, including 
Wimbledon, the FA Cup, Six Nations rugby, Formula 1, which is now shared
with Sky, and Premier League highlights for Match of the Day.

Rival
broadcasters believe there should be a level playing field, with the 
BBC unable to give away for free events that they have to pay for.

Warning: Tory Party Chairman Grant Shapps suggested the BBC could face a cut in the licence fee or even have to compete with other broadcasters for a share of the money

The idea has been put to Culture Secretary Maria Miller to allow them to bid for a slice of the licence fee to air sporting events deemed too important and popular to be restricted to pay-to-view premium channels.

A source close to Mrs Miller said: ’There is a conversation to be had there as to whether the BBC should be funding things that are also covered by commercial broadcasters.

’There's an array of sporting events,’ the source told the Daily Telegraph.

’It would impact on the licence fee. The money that was given to the BBC could theoretically be given to other broadcasters who were doing something that we would consider of public service.

’The BBC covers a whole range of events which private commercial broadcasters pay to cover.

’The licence fee is not a given right any more. There is an acknowledgement that the change in commercial broadcasters means this is something that needs to be looked at.

’If the BBC doesn't put its house in order we will bring forward talks on the royal charter and start to thrash it out earlier.’

The changes could be forced through as part of the renewal of the BBCs royal charter, due in 2016.

Tories argue that the £145.50-a-year licence fee would be 'too much' if the BBC failed to reform by 2016.

Mr Shapps, the Conservative party chairman, said the Corporation must rebuild confidence following the Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall abuse scandals, controversy over fat cat salaries and pay-offs to stars and senior executives.

He also hinted at Tory frustrations with the BBC's perceived Left-wing bias - saying it faced a 'question of credibility' over whether it applies 'fairness' to its political reporting.

'People pay their licence fee in this country because people believe that we should have public service broadcast program-ming,' said Mr Shapps. 'Of course, there are lots of different ways you could do that. I would also say that £145.50 is quite a lot to pay for everyone in the country who has a TV.

'It is too much if we don't see the kind of reforms that all public organisations are used to, that the BBC isn't having to engage with as much as it could do.'

His intervention brought a sharp response yesterday from the BBC's former director-general Greg Dyke, who accused Mr Shapps of trying to bully the Corporation.

Mr Dyke said: 'This is an attempt to pressurise and intimidate the BBC, which is what governments do, and the BBC's job is to resist. This is so predictable.

’Honestly, I've been waiting for it to happen. Eighteen months from an election, the government of the day - it doesn't matter which government - decides to start pressurising the BBC and say, "if we win again, we're going to take away your money".'
