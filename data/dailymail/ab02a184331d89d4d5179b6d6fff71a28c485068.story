Danny Cipriani has every right to feel aggrieved and bewildered by his omission from this England squad - which is otherwise a largely logical selection based on current fitness and form.

The Sale fly-half is without question one of the country's three leading No 10s at present, but he has been overlooked despite making a favourable impression when recalled for the June tour of New Zealand. 

As exclusively revealed by Sportsmail last week, head coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants have chosen Owen Farrell, George Ford and Stephen Myler as their stand-offs.

Forwards: J Marler (Harlequins), M Mullan (Wasps), K Brookes (Newcastle), D Wilson (Bath), D Hartley (Northampton), R Webber (Bath), D Attwood (Bath), G Kruis (Saracens), J Launchbury (Wasps), C Lawes (Northampton), C Clark (Northampton), J Haskell (Wasps), B Morgan (Gloucester), C Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), B Vunipola (Saracens), T Wood (Northampton).

Backs: D Care (Harlequins), L Dickson (Northampton), B Youngs (Leicester), O Farrell (Saracens), G Ford (Bath), S Myler (Northampton), B Barritt (Saracens), L Burrell (Northampton), K Eastmond (Bath), J Joseph (Bath), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester), M Brown (Harlequins), A Goode (Saracens), J May (Gloucester), J Nowell (Exeter), S Rokoduguni (Bath), M Yarde (Harlequins).

There can be no quibbling with the inclusion of the first two men, although Farrell's lack of game-time this season is cause for concern. He has started just once for Saracens and missed three matches with a hamstring injury, before making a late cameo comeback last Saturday.

It will be intriguing to see if his club help England out by naming Farrell in their line-up to face Munster on Friday, or keep him in reserve as Charlie Hodgson is playing so majestically. Of course, there may be a compromise option with Farrell in midfield, which is a scenario the national team may also consider, with Ford as the primary playmaker at 10.

The Bath tyro has been mostly very impressive in the early stages of this campaign, but he - along with many of his club-mates, suffered a chastening experience in Glasgow last weekend. Yet, that didn't harm his Test prospects as he had already done enough to make the cut.

It is the third fly-half place which prompts the heated debate. Lancaster and the rest of the England management team had more or less settled on their selections last week, but the first round of European matches held their thinking up to awkward scrutiny.

For 40 minutes in Salford, Cipriani was magnificent in leading Munster a merry dance. Some shaky moments followed, but he will always create more problems for the other team than his own. He has a range of individual skills and a sheer audacity that Myler does not deliver for Northampton.

In the first week of the season, the Saints' stand-off was superb against Gloucester - showcasing a greater variety of kicking and distribution than in the past. But he will often act as a steady link-man for his club; bringing in powerful runners around him and kicking his goals. He is seen as steady and reliable, but he missed a crucial kick in Paris on Saturday as Northampton lost, whereas Cipriani's goal-kicking was immaculate for Sale, on a high-pressure occasion.

Lancaster's decision to pick Stephen Myler over Cipriani is a conservative and cautious decision

The decision to pick Myler ahead of Cipriani is a conservative, cautious one, which deprives England of the option of turning to a creative player who could pull a rabbit out of a hat when they are chasing a game. This squad announcement was delayed in order for relevant form to be taken into account, but that doesn't appear to have happened in this case.

Elsewhere, it has. Choosing Semesa Rokoduguni as one of the wings makes sense as the Fiji-born Bath flier has been the most effective wide-man in the Aviva Premiership this season. The omission of Chris Ashton is harsh on the basis of his fine club form, but comes down to doubts stemming from his tour efforts. Yet, there have also been management doubts about Jonny May, but he is in.

The loss of Manu Tuilagi to injury is a savage blow to England's autumn prospects, but the inclusion of Jonathan Joseph is the right response. He has been superb for Bath - running with real menace and scoring tries. Midfield is an area of regular concern for Lancaster, but the coaches are right to give Billy Twelvetrees the benefit of the doubt.

Up front, a raft of front-five injuries limited the coaches' options, and there can be few arguments with their selections. In the absence of Geoff Parling and Ed Slater, there was a tussle for the fourth lock place and George Kruis of Saracens has won the vote. In the back row, Calum Clark has been excelling for Northampton and his consistency of late has been fairly rewarded.
