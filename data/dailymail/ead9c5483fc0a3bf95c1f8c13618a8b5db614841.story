A widowed Thai mother is facing deportation and could be forced to leave her children in the UK after her British husband was killed in a car crash.

Om Gorry, 36, faces the prospect of leaving her children, James, 10, and Emily, four, and returning to her native Thailand because she has been unable to prove to officials that she is their primary carer.

Mrs Gorry, whose British husband Alan was killed in a car crash two years ago, has been told her children are British citizens and so are entitled to remain in the UK.

Om Gorry, 36, faces being deported to her native Thailand after her British husband Alan died. Mrs Gorry (pictured with the pair's children, James, 10, and Emily, four) is currently living in Hampshire with her children

Mrs Gorry, who was born in Thailand, moved to the UK to live with husband Alan (together above) in 2004. However, the pair moved back to Thailand when she found out her mother was ill and her husband later died

She said officials have suggested that they could be looked after by their paternal grandmother in Barton-on-Sea, Hampshire.

However, Mrs Gorry is appealing the decision and family and friends have now launched a petition to keep her in the country while an online campaign in support of her case is growing support.

Mrs Gorry married her husband in 2004 and the couple lived in Hampshire before temporarily moving back to the Far East in 2007 because her mother was ill.

Between 2004 and 2007, Mrs Gorry applied for permanent residency in the UK, which she was granted.

However, after moving to Thailand, and leaving the UK for more than two years, her right to a permanent residency was ended.

After the death of both of her parents and Mr Gorry in the space of three years while living in Thailand, Mrs Gorry decided to return to England with her children so she would have the support of her late husband's family.

She was granted a temporary European Economic Area Family Permit visa to enter and live in the UK and they moved in with Mr Gorry's mother Pat in April last year.

The children settled in at a local school and the family has since tried to move on from the tragedy of losing 36-year-old Mr Gorry.

The European Economic Area Family Permit allowed Mrs Gorry to live in the UK as long as her two children, who both hold British citizenship, remained in the country.

In addition to the permit, Mrs Gorry chose to apply for a derivative residence card, which proves the holder has the right to live in the UK as a primary carer and shows employers they are allowed to work here. 

She said she was desperate to be granted the derivative residence card because it would help her find employment in the UK.

However, she recently got a letter from the Home office which said it had rejected her application and reviewed her case.

Officials said she had not proved she was the primary carer of her children and suggested that her 69-year-old mother-in-law could care for James and Emily instead.

In an apparent U-turn by the Home Office, her passport has now been confiscated and she has been told to make plans to return to her homeland immediately.

She said: 'Everything was going really well, we had a new start and I was getting my life back together then suddenly this is hanging over me.

'When I got the letter from the Home Office I was so shocked and upset and I just couldn't get my head around it.

'They said I hadn't proved that I was James' mother but we sent his birth certificate and Alan's death certificate. I just don't know what more I can do to prove it to them.

'Who on earth is going to leave without their children? My little girl is only four, I'm not going to leave her.

'If I have to go I would have to take them back to Thailand with me, but that wouldn't be what's best for them. They've just started settling in and making friends at school.

'It will affect them if I have to leave. They've already lost their father and now the government wants to take their mother away from them too.

'The decision is ridiculous.'

The letters also warn Mrs Gorry that she should 'make arrangements to leave' the UK and return to Thailand

Helen Thompson, a family member, has now launched a petition to send to Prime Minister David Cameron, which has already fetched more than 2,600 signatures.

She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for the family and to suggest Pat can be the primary carer is ridiculous. They haven't asked her or done any checks on her finances or health.

'She works in London four days a week, she's going to be 70 this year and she has an enlarged aorta so she has to watch her blood pressure.

'There's no way Om would leave her children here, she'd have to take them with her back to Thailand, but then that's denying their rights as British citizens.

'The effect it would have on the children would just be devastating. It's just outrageous.

‘They love being over here with all the family, they just love it.

‘They are denying the children’s right to a family life. It’s just ludicrous.

'It shouldn't have to come to this and it has cost us so much money already.

'Om's amazing, she's a really strong person but we all have our moments where we get upset and worried. She just needs the structure and stability now to move on with her life.' 

Mrs Gorry (pictured with her 10-year-old son James and four-year-old daughter Emily) said she is appealing the Home Office decision. Friends and family have also set up an online petition against the deportation

Mrs Gorry is appealing the Home Office decision but doesn’t know when the case will be heard.

She is appealing on the grounds that the decision fails to consider the best interests of her children and that it doesn’t take into account her right to a family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

She also claims the Home Office decision fails to take into consideration the compassionate and exceptional circumstances which she has found herself in, and the fact she has been the children’s primary carer since they were born.

A Home Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'This case is subject to an ongoing appeal and it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage.'
