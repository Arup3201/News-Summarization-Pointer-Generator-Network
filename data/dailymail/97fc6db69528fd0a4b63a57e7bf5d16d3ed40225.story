Prince William showed he is following in the family footsteps as he revealed a bald patch on his royal crown at a tea ceremony in Tokyo.

The 32-year-old showed an increasing resemblance to his Uncle Edward while enjoying the lavish refreshments at a renovated tea house in the Hama Rikyu Gardens in central Tokyo.

The second-in-line to the throne has been gradually losing his hair for many years, just like his uncle, who began going bald at the age of 21.

Warm welcome: Prince William's visit to Tokyo began with a traditional tea ceremony  

The second-in-line to the throne has been gradually losing his hair for many years, just like his uncle, who began going bald at the age of 21 

Traditional: The tea ceremony is an ancient tradition in Japan and is a sign of respect

Despite Diana's blonde locks driving the Japanese wild on her visits there, Prince William appears to have inherited the so-called 'curse of the Windsors'. 

The elder members of the Royal Family deal with their follicular challenges in different ways.

William's paternal grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh - who began losing his hair at 28 - makes little attempt to disguise his shining pate and Prince Edward also favours the honest approach.

Prince Charles, however, who began losing his hair at 28, goes for the 'combover'.

In contrast, Prince Harry's bushy ginger mop as yet shows no sign of following the same trend.

Most experts agree that male pattern baldness is passed on by the mother's side of the family. William's late grandfather Earl Spencer had a bald patch.

But scientists have found evidence that in some cases it can also come down from the father's side. 

The future king has himself previously joked about his receding hairline, telling photographers and reporters after Prince George was born: 'He's got more hair than me, thank God.'  

William was given a rapturous welcome as he was met by flag-waving fans in Tokyo as he marked the start of week-long tour of Japan and China on behalf of the Government.

After a twelve-hour flight and a whirlwind tour of Tokyo in the driving rain, he was treated to full-blown traditional tea ceremony, complete with a delicate plate of cakes. 

Joined by Tokyo governor, Yoichi Masuzoe, William watched as servers prepared the bitter green tea powder before adding water and frothing the mixture using a small wooden whisk.

The ceremony, which took place in the same tea house used to welcome Prince Albert during his visit to the country in 1869, is a sign of respect.  

William is at the start of a four-day visit to Japan, during which he will travel to Fukushima, the centre of a nuclear meltdown triggered by the 2011 tsunami.

The first two days, however, are to be spent in the Japanese capital Tokyo and it was there he landed, arriving at Haneda airport in the early hours of the morning.

Met by Mr Masuzoe and hundreds of excited fans, William was ushered into a boat limousine before being whisked across the water to the site of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.  

Royal visit: Prince Albert had his tea ceremony at the same tea house, recently restored, as William

Fascinated: William looked on intently as the history of Japan's tea ceremony was explained 

Ritual: The moment was overseen by Sen Genshitsu (left), a former grand master of the Urasenke (ceremony)

Beautiful: William got a brief tour of the spectacular Hama Rikyu gardens

Historic: The classical gardens once belonged to a shogun, one of the hereditary military governors of Japan

Long day: It was dark by the time the Prince left the tea ceremony but still very wet

Big group: The Duke and the governor were trailed by a large group of flunkies

Piling in: The group did manage to squeeze into the park's beautifully restored tea house

Rapturous: William was met by a crowd of smartphone-waving fans at Tokyo's Haneda airport

Pleased: The Prince looked thrilled with his warm welcome and beamed at the crowd of well-wishers

All smiles: Before leaving the airport, he treated fans to a smile and a wave

The Prince, who appeared none the worse for his long flight, smiled and waved at the pursuing press, among them photographers crammed onto a boat travelling close behind. 

After completing the tea ceremony at the Hama Rikyu Gardens, he was then shown around the Edo-era style plot, which is filled with sculpted pine trees and blossoming plum trees and once belonged to a shogun [Japanese aristocrat].

Wooden bridges run over several lakes, where water birds float. Gardeners have been hard at work for days, clipping the trees and setting up lights, preparing for the visit.

It was a rare peaceful moment in what looks set to be a busy schedule, with meetings with Japan's much-loved Emperor Akihito and Crown Prince Naruhito all on the agenda.

But the visit isn't without controversy, much of it due to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who, say critics, is 'using' the royal visit to Fukushima to further his own aims.

One, Tokuo Hayakawa, a Buddhist priest from the town of Naraha, two miles from the Fukushima plant, told The Times: 'I think Abe is using him [William].

'It's true that you can find children playing outside, and you can eat some Fukushima food. But to take that as the overall reality here is totally wrong. 

And again! When the Prince arrived at Tokyo's Hama Rikyu Gardens, yet more fans were waiting

Drizzly: Despite a torrential downpour, William spent several minutes meeting well-wishers

Colourful: With many clutching British Union flags and Japanese Nisshōki, the crowd was a colourful sight

Excited: A pleased-looking William found himself surrounded by smiling female fans

Child-friendly: Also waiting to welcome the Prince was a group of local students still in their school uniform

All smiles: Prince William spent several minutes chatting to the youngsters

Grey day: William arrived at the Tokyo park on a boat limousine, watched by a cheering crowd

Thrilled: Excited Japanese fans wait in the rain to see the Prince arrive at the Hama Rikyu Gardens

'If I could, I would take him to these abandoned ghost towns, and to the temporary houses where people still live, so he could see the reality that we are facing.'

Less controversial is William's visit to a TV broadcaster, where he will meet actors dressed as samurai and geishas, and his visit to a bookshop where Aston Martin cars will be on display. 

Along with Fukushima, the 32-year-old Prince will  visit other areas devastated by the March 2011 tsunami to show support for the survivors and pay his respects to those who died.

The tsunami and the earthquake that set it off killed 9,000 people, and displaced tens of thousands, among them those caught in the Fukushima meltdown.

Japan and the UK have enjoyed friendly relations for decades, and, as a result, the Japanese public is almost as enthusiastic about British royals as they are about their own.

William, who has had a Japanese following since childhood, is particularly popular thanks to the influence of his mother.

Indeed, so loved was the late Princess of Wales, her visits to Japan in 1986 and 1995 sparked what local commentators described as 'Diana fever'. 

Crowd control: Even the local police couldn't resist queuing up for a chat with the Prince

No stopping: Happily, not even heavy downpours could dampen the spirits of royal fans

Still going: Despite having just stepped off the plane, William was happy to wave at pursuing photographers

Quick tour: William's first stop was at the site of the 2020 Olympics, currently under construction

Pleased: A cheerful William was accompanied by Tokyo governor, Yoichi Masuzoe (left)

Royal welcome: Boats from Tokyo's fire brigade sprayed plumes of coloured water to welcome the Prince

Chilly: At a chilly six degrees Celsius and with driving rain lashing down, Tokyo proved similar to London

Toughing it out: With the help of a pair of umbrella-wielding flunkies, William and the governor toughed it out=
