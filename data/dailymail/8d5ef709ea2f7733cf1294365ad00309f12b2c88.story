Television's ‘Queen of Mean’ Anne Robinson is the latest addition to the Henley Literary Festival

Television's ‘Queen of Mean’ Anne Robinson and Captain Phillips director Paul Greengrass are the latest additions to the Henley Literary Festival, alongside big names from fiction, sport, politics and more.

The festival, supported by the Daily Mail, will bring the likes of Princess Michael of Kent, Emma Bridgewater, Paddy Ashdown, Earl Spencer and rugby star Gareth Thomas to picturesque Henley-on-Thames from September 29 to October 5.

Robinson will chair events with Mail writer Simon Heffer, Conservative MP Liam Fox and controversial former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride. Baroness Doreen Lawrence will be interviewed by Bafta-winning film-maker Greengrass, whose credits include the TV film The Murder Of Stephen Lawrence.

David Nicholls is in conversation with Mail literary editor Sandra Parsons on October 5, just days after Us, his first book since One Day, is published. Other bestselling novelists featured at the festival include Adele Parks, Jojo Moyes, Jenny Colgan and Tony Parsons, while debut authors include Rosa Rankin-Gee, Abbie Ross and Cesca Major.

Director of the Bourne Trilogy and Captain Phillips. Paul Greengrass, will also speak at the festival 

The regular Crime & Wine evening returns with thriller writers Erin Kelly and Kate Rhodes providing the crime and Laithwaite’s supplying the wine. The festival’s final day will include a special staged reading of a new play, Martini Days, by actress Eleanor Bron, whose credits range from Help! to her current role in The Archers. She will be joined by Mail writer Craig Brown and her old Establishment Club co-star, satirist John Bird.

The Wrong Knickers author Bryony Gordon will be quizzed by fellow columnist Polly Vernon in a Friday evening event, while earlier in the week Emma Freud and Dawn O’Porter will talk vintage fashion. Henley’s rowing connections are celebrated in three events looking at all aspects of the sport, including Jack Carlson on blazers and Olympian Alison Mowbray — each take place on a boat on the Thames.

History events include Chris Bryant MP on Parliament, Selina Hastings on her father, the Red Earl, Sinclair McKay on Dunkirk and Helen Castor on Joan of Arc. Two events on Saturday, October 5 will focus on local author Ian Fleming; original illustrator John Burningham on the 50th anniversary of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Matthew Parker, author of the acclaimed biography Goldeneye, discussing Fleming’s time in Jamaica with broadcaster Sue Cook.

Author of One Day David Nicholls will attend the event

Penny Junor will talk about her new biography of Prince Harry while explorer David Hempleman-Adams, DJ Mike Read and playwright Bonnie Greer will each look back on their careers.

There are more than 20 events for children aged two and up, including Pigsticks and Harold illustrator Alex Milway, Julia Copus’s Hog In The Fog sing-along and a chance for four to seven-year-olds to create a digital storybook with Bubble Trouble author Tom Percival.
