A man has been charged with animal abuse after taking his dog to the veterinarian.

Jermell Blackman of Westbury, New York, took his dog in after he was concerned about how much weight the animal had lost and thinking it had been poisoned, at which point it was discovered the severely underweight dog had been eating wood and plastic.

What's more, the dog was filthy, covered in sores and so cold that its temperature did not register on a thermometer.

Blackman also bred and sold dogs to friends, frequently posting photos of the animals alongside his email address and phone number (above)

Newsday reports that the 2-year-old dog Scotia, a pit bull-terrier mix, also had a heart rate that was one-half to one-third to what a normal dog's heart rate should be.

After almost an hour trying to save the dog, it was euthanized. 

Blackman, 34, was arraigned Monday on misdemeanor animal abuse and released soon after.

According to his Facebook page, Blackman also bred and sold dogs to friends, frequently posting photos of the animals alongside his email address and phone number.

He even had his own Facebook and Instagram accounts for his business, called Trucklife Bullies.

Blackman bred Scotia with another dog last year, and was selling one of the resulting pups in December for $2,000 plus shipping.
