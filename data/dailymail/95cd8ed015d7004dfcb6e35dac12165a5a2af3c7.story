Three men and a woman found shot dead in a car in Alabama last week had each written suicide notes proclaiming their innocence of child pornography allegations and outlining how they wanted their funerals to go, police said on Monday.

Kristie Hunt Campbell Hamrick, 39; her ex-husband, Samuel Hamrick, 30; her brother, Robert Andy Keith Hunt, 38; and Kevin Carey, 30, a family friend were discovered Wednesday night by the side of a logging road in William B. Bankhead National Forest in Winston County, about 65 miles northwest of Birmingham.

Winston County Sheriff Rick Harris confirmed the identities of the victims, who all lived in the same home in Savannah, Tennessee, on Monday, and said they appeared to have died in a grisly suicide pact.

Hunt is believed to have been the gunman, killing the three others with a 12-gauge shotgun inside the vehicle before taking his own life, Harris said.

The Hamricks had been scheduled to appear in court in Tennessee in an FBI child-pornography investigation the day their bodies were found.

Harris said he couldn't discuss the case on Monday but said it was likely all four were caught up in the inquiry.

'Something was a bond for them together, and it may be it was as simple as criminality was their bond,' he told WBRC TV of Birmingham.

Harris called the alleged crimes 'pretty bizarre, pretty terrible.'

He told The Birmingham News: 'If you have the FBI coming in to investigate, it's pretty serious.'

All four had left statements in the car, written on legal paper, that proclaimed their innocence, listed family contacts and outlined their funeral wishes.

Harris told The News that it was one of the most bizarre cases he has ever handled in his police career.

'If someone was an aspiring writer, they might have an episode out of this,' he said.

Earlier, Harris said he was perplexed as to why the four chose Winston County as the location to end their lives, and assured its residents they were was no crazed killer on the loose.

'Whatever started in Tennessee seems to have ended in Winston County,' he told The Cullman Times. 'We absolutely do not believe there is anyone dangerous still running around in our county.'

'Our question is why they wound up in our state. We're sure their problems originated elsewhere. I don't think in any way our county is in danger. Nobody should fear who is next.'

Harris believes the four may have been staying in hotels in the area last week.

A passer-by noticed the vehicle on her way to work on Wednesday morning and called police when she saw it hadn't moved on her way home.

The victims' bodies were found in a white car with out-of-state
license plates.

Dozens of law enforcement officers were at the scene just
south of the Double Springs area Thursday.

'We spent all night processing the scene and we took the
vehicle to an indoor location to process the vehicle,' Harris said Thursday
morning.

Investigators were waiting on results of forensics testing.
He said the Alabama Bureau of Investigation was assisting his agency with the
case, as well as the coroner and district attorney's office.
