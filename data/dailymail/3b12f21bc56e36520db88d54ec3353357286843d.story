England's coaches are confident that Ben Youngs can thrive on a return to the starting XV at Eden Park on Saturday, as they brace themselves to rule out Danny Care.

The Harlequins scrum half was officially named in the tourists’ line-up on Wednesday night for the first Test against the All Blacks, but it appears increasingly likely that he will be forced to withdraw from the match.

Care will have a fitness test on Thursday morning and if, as expected, a shoulder injury prevents him from taking part in the series opener, Youngs will be promoted from the bench.

Faith: England coach Stuart Lancaster believes Youngs is returning to his top form in time for the daunting New Zealand tour

It has not been a vintage season for the Leicester No 9, but Stuart Lancaster claimed that he is returning to peak performance levels in time for this daunting clash with the world champions.

‘It would be a big blow losing Danny, but that would be lessened by Ben whose form picked up at the end of the season,’ said England’s head coach.

‘If you go back to the game in 2012 when he started against New Zealand, that was him at his best and he's approaching that form now.’

Lancaster strongly hinted that Care will be removed from the side for this weekend’s encounter, in order to be back at full throttle for the second and third Tests, adding: ‘Danny is 50-50 I'd say at the moment. We want to make sure we're doing right by him.

'To go into a Test against the All Blacks with anyone who is not 100 per cent physically and mentally would be a poor decision, so we need to make sure he's 100 per cent right.

‘I also have my mind on the fact there's more than one game in this series, so I want to make sure I'm doing right by him. I know he's desperate to play because he's been exceptional in the Premiership and for us this season. We have to do the right thing.’

Yet another enforced reshuffle by England would include a bench role for Lee Dickson, even though the Northampton scrum half was among the players involved in last Saturday’s Aviva Premiership Final, and thus – theoretically – out of contention to play here.

But Lancaster has no misgivings about asking the experienced Saint to be ready for an international appearance so soon after a long-haul flight.

Long haul: Northampton's Lee Dickson, seen here with the Aviva Premiership trophy after the win over Saracens at Twickenham last weekend, has joined the England party out in New Zealand

‘Lee's excited,’ he said. ‘He's just played in a final, he's won it and is absolutely buzzing. He didn't train today and we need to manage him carefully.

'As soon as we knew about Danny we got word back to him in England. He started adjusting his time and sleep patterns from England to make sure he's adjusted. He'll be ready, no problem.’
