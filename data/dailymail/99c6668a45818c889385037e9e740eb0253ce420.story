High-flying: Businesswoman Sarah Davison has been awarded £1.6million in damages after her career was cut short by botched post-birth surgery

A high-flying banker whose career was cut short by botched post-birth surgery has been awarded more than £1.6 million in damages.

Businesswoman Sarah Davison gave birth to her first child Freddie at Portland Hospital, London, in December 2008 with the help of an episiotomy - a surgical incision used to enlarge the vaginal opening.

However, only two weeks later, the 36-year-old started to experience agonising pain, severe difficulty controlling her bowels and an inability to stifle wind.

The procedure had caused a third degree tear, which was not spotted after her consultant obstetrician Craig Leitch failed to carry out a 'proper' examination, London's High Court heard.

After realising the extent of Mrs Davison's injury, Mr Leitch then carried out 'plainly insufficient' repair work at the private hospital in Great Portland Street, said Mrs Justice Andrews.

He also failed to keep a clear record of what he had done.

'It appears that there was no proper
examination carried out post-delivery, so that the severity of the tear
remained undetected and thus it was not made the subject of immediate 
surgical repair and treatment with antibiotics,' she said. 

Mrs Davison, who was a vice president of Credit Suisse in Canary Wharf, London, before going on maternity leave, has since been left in mental and physical pain - meaning she can no longer work in the financial sector.

Despite undergoing reconstruction surgery and other treatment, she has been left with significant ongoing symptoms causing her embarrassment, inconvenience and distress, the court heard.

Mrs Justice Andrews said that the 
mother-of-three has adapted well to her condition - however, the 
experience has taken its toll on her mental health, particularly her 
ability to cope with stressful situations.

She said Mrs Davison was an intelligent, able and articulate woman who had secured a place on the prestigious 
Goldman Sachs training programme after graduating from Warwick 
University with a first-class degree.

By 2006, the businesswoman had risen to the position of vice president at Credit Suisse in Canary Wharf - where she earned a net salary of 10,700 a month before taking maternity leave.

At the time of Freddie's birth, she had every prospect of returning to the pursuit of a highly successful career in the city, said the Mrs Justice Andrews.

Lawyers for Mr Leitch admitted 
liability in July this year and agreed to pay damages for Mrs Davison's pain and suffering, 
future medical and surgical costs and psychiatric care.

But they contested Mrs Davison’s claim for loss of past and future earnings and congenial employment.

However, Mrs Justice Andrews rejected the defence case that Mrs Davison’s failure to return to work was not a result of her injury but a lifestyle choice - instead awarding her £1.59million, as well as interest and her legal costs.

'This is a case in which Mrs Davison’s injury has put paid to her ability to return to any form of work in the financial sector and severely limited the nature of any future employment,' she said.

'Many of her undoubted talents are going to go to waste. Her future is uncertain and any work that she does undertake in future is likely to be fairly solitary and considerably less well paid.'

After the case, Mrs Davison said she was relieved that the legal proceedings had come to an end.

However, she said it was 'hugely disappointing' that she had been forced to invest five years fighting to understand what happened during Freddie’s birth at the hospital.

'As yet, there has been no apology from Mr Leitch despite an admission of medical negligence,' she said.

'I hope that my case can benefit other women looking to minimise unnecessary risk at childbirth and enjoy safe and effective care.'

Shivi Nathan, a medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell, who represented Mrs Davison, said: 'Sarah suffered a horrendous, life-changing injury as a result of this doctor’s negligence, which is shocking and simply not acceptable.

'Sarah chose to go through private care for the birth of her son thinking it was the safest option for her but, from the care she received from Mr Leitch, this couldn’t have been further from the truth.

'The consequences of his actions will stay with Sarah forever and mean she can no longer work in the profession which she worked so hard in.

'Sarah was on the path to even greater success and this was simply cut short by the actions of Mr Leitch.'
