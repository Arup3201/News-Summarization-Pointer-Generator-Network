When it comes to feline fashion, these collars really are the cat's whiskers.

The quirky cat accessories have been made to look like huge lion manes when worn, transforming the average domestic cat into a miniature ferocious predator.

The fluffy fashion items come in a range of colours including tabby, black, ginger, grey, brown.

These quirky cat accessories could certainly raise a grrr-in, as they have been made to look like huge lion manes

The 'Mini Manes' were invented by Kristine Wisniewski who wanted to dress her Cornish Rex cat, Fergie, in a lion costume for Halloween

Each collar is made from acrylic faux fur and are around seven inches in diameter so they can be gently pulled on and off the average sized pet cat.

The 'Mini Manes' were invented by Kristine Wisniewski who wanted to dress her Cornish Rex cat, Fergie, in a lion costume for Halloween.

She couldn't find any manes on the market and made her own out of fabric, before she decided to set up an online shop selling them to other pet owners.

Each mane costs between £9 and £13.

Ms Wisniewski , 27, from Toronto in Canada said: 'The idea for Mini Manes came about four years ago.

'My husband and I were trying to figure out what we should dress our Cornish Rex cat, Fergie, as for Halloween.

'We thought it would be funny to dress him as a lion so we went out, purchased a fabric sample, and made a little lion mane out of it.

'There are so many different things on the market for cats and dogs, little Halloween costumes, jackets, sweaters, but there were no cat manes.

'Our friends and family all got a kick out of it, but we never thought about selling them until recently.

'I thought I would just open up a shop on Etsy to see if they would sell and they've been selling more than I thought they would.

'They are suitable for any type of cat, from hairless to fluffy, although they do look better on cats with short hair since the mane stands out more on their fur.

'The Manes simply slip on and off the cat, like a collar, they're small enough to stay on but large enough to be removed easily and not choke the cat.'
