Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz believes Lionel Messi is the 'best player ever' following Barcelona's Champions League victory over the French side on Wednesday night.

Messi sparked Barca's comeback against PSG by scoring the equaliser in their 3-1 win at the Nou Camp - a result that saw them qualify as Group F winners at the expense of Laurent Blanc's side.

And the Argentina star's performance really stood out, according to Luiz.

'It's the efficiency that made the difference,' the Brazil centre half  told Canal+.

'They were better than us; they have three huge forwards. Messi is fantastic, the best player ever.

'Barca also have a smart head coach and other great players.'

PSG knew a draw would see them finish top of their group and they were on course for victory after Zlatan Ibrahimovic put them ahead on 15 minutes.

However, strikes from Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez changed the complexion of the match - with the performance of Barcelona's No 10 in particular standing out for Luiz. 

The defeat means PSG will now face one of the group winners in the last 16, with Luiz acknowledging the difficulty of the task their side could face in the next round.

'We will now think about the next step. The next game will be difficult. We'll have to beat everybody to go all the way. In February we could play anyone,' he added.
