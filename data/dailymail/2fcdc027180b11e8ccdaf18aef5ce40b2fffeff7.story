Plunging styles might be all the rage on the red carpet but navel-scraping necklines aren't always the easiest to wear.

Now Wonderbra has come to the rescue with its lowest bra to date which claims to offer support while minimising pitfalls such as accidental nipple slips and side-boob.

The bra, which comes in a choice of black or nude, features a front that dips down as far the solar plexus so it can be worn under a cleavage-baring frock.

Taking the plunge: The new offering from Wonderbra comes in a choice of black or nude

The new bra comes hot on the heels of research that found one in 10 women plan to wear a daringly low cut dress to their office Christmas party.

A celebrity-inspired trend, plunging necklines have become a common sight on the red carpet with Holly Willoughby, Blake Lively and Miranda Kerr among those daring enough to bare their cleavage.

But the plunging trend isn't just a hit with celebrities: according to Wonderbra, baring the chest is also popular with women who want to snare themselves a new beau at their office Christmas party.

According to research, one in five British people meet their partners at work - another reason why demand for cleavage baring styles has shot up.

Celebrity fans of low cut frocks who have pulled off the same trick include Sophia Vergara, who met her husband Joe Gonzalez on set, and Miranda Kerr who first laid eyes on former husband Orlando Bloom while at work.

'It is great that so many women want to embrace the plunge trend,' said Martina Alexander, Wonderbra's UK marketing manager.

'Our new Ultimate Plunge bra will give them the confidence to do so with no embarrassing mishaps.'Â
