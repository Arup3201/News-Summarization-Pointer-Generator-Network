In the age of the internet hoax, viral video can be as slippery as an eel.

Take Tim and Ray Hamilton, who made a pair of popular prank videos this month purporting to show a monster eel in Manuwatau River, on the North Island of New Zealand.

Using special effects they learned from working in cinematography, the 20-second clips have duped hundreds of thousands of viewers, garnered them an offer from their local council and even led to a proposal from an American television show.

The first od the two popular 20-second-clips, 'Monster Eel yells at pizza bread in Manawatu River'. The videoshave garnered hundreds of thousands of views as well as an offer from an American television show

‘A viral video show called Right This Minute told us they wanted to use the video,’ said Tim Hamilton.

‘We said "sure, be our guests". We never pretended it was real, we just went along with it! I’m not sure if it’s actually going on the show now, but we never lied about the nature of the clip.’

Eventually, the brothers let the cat out of the bag.

‘It started to become a moralistic issue,’ said Tim Hamilton. ‘The river we filmed in is very polluted. We were being approached by activists, as well as Palmerston North City Council, who were excited to start pouring money into the issue. We decided we had to throw in the towel.’

‘Pahiatua, where we filmed the video, is kind of a medieval town. We realised that if we kept this up, we would probably be burned at the stake.’

The brothers own a special effects company called The Shizz, where they are commissioned to make promotional videos.

It was here they learned the expertise to make the video convincing.

The brothers eventually decided to expose the videos when they were contacted by their local council, who thought they represented an environmental concern

‘It was a pretty simple process. We caught some eels from the river, took them into a bathtub and filmed them over a red screen. We fed them luncheon meat, they blew the scale of the images up so it looks like pizza bread. Then we imposed it over some footage of Manuhatu river.’

Mr Hamilton recalls the best reactions to the videos.

‘There were plenty of people who were saying, "We’ve seen these before also". It was really funny. I think the quality of a YouTube video is not necessarily the number of views it gets, but the quality of the dialogue it creates.’

But he says he is unsure if there's a magic ingredient for a viral video.

‘I don’t know you can manufacture a big hit on the internet. Ultimately I think you just need to release lots of quality videos and hope for the best. It’s just like entering the lotto: you gotta be in it to win it!’
