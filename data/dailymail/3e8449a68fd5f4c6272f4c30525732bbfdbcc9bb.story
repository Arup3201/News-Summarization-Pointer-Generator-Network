An 11-year-old child prodigy has started his first semester in college.

Accepted when he was only 10, Carson Huey-You is attending Texas Christian University majoring in quantum physics. The youngster was co-valedictorian of his senior class and scored a 1770 on his SAT, speaks Mandarin Chinese and played the piano in the Admissions Center, according to the campus newspaper. Though impressive, Huey-You is not the youngest-ever college student.

Huey-You is so young that he could not apply online, the software would not accept an applicant born in 2002, TCU360 reported.

Enrolled in four classes, the whiz kid commutes to campus with his mother carrying his books as he shuttles from class to class, according to WFAA.

‘It's not like I'm leaving him here to stay in dorms and join a fraternity,’ mother Claretta Huey-You told WFAA.

Huey-You is expected to graduate when he’s 16, a full year younger than the previous youngest-ever student at TCU, according to TCU 360.  He enrolled in four classes during his first semester at TCU.

‘‘I’m taking calculus, physics, history and religion. Those are my four classes,’ Huey-You told CBS DFW.

The young genius could read by age 1, and was doing pre-algebra by age 5 – he relaxes by doing algebra, according to CBS DFW.

Professors are already singing his praises.

‘He’s definitely very talented and also he’s very serious about his work and he really enjoys it.  And that’s the best that a professor can hope for his students, right?’ Associate math professor Qao Zhang said to CBS DFW.

Still adjusting to college, Carson Huey-You told TCU 360 that his first week ‘was overwhelming but exciting and fun.’

Perhaps motivated by her son taking on college, Claretta Huey-You plans to return to school to study nursing, she told TCU 360. The 11-year-old’s brother is also gifted and expected to graduate high school when he is 13.

If all goes as planned, Carson Huey-You will have his college degree before he has his driver’s license. Though impressive, he isn't the youngest-ever college student.

That distinction belongs to Michael Kearney. Kearny graduated San Mateo High School in 1990 when only six-years-old. At age 10 he had earned his bachelor's degree in anthropology from the University of South Alabama. His master's degree in biochemistry was awarded when he was 14-years-old. Kearney was teaching college at only 17.
