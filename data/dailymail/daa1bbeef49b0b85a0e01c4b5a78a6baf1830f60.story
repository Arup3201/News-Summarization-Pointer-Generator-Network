Pressure: Shaun Wright is facing calls from many, including David Cameron,  to resign from his current post running South Yorkshire police

The police and crime commissioner at the centre of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal faces a showdown with MPs today amid claims he ignored the plight of victims who turned to him for help.

The account of another abuse victim increased the pressure on Shaun Wright, who was the councillor in charge of children’s services for five years before being elected to run the police in South Yorkshire.

Yesterday Martin Kimber, Rotherham council’s chief executive announced he was quitting his £160,000 a year job in December ‘to enable the town to recover’ under new leadership.

Mr Kimber, who joined the authority in 2009, made the decision two weeks after Professor Alexis Jay’s report revealed how failures by agencies left 1,400 youngsters open to sexual exploitation by predominantly Asian men over a 16-year period.

The council’s Labour leader Roger Stone quit his position when the report was published.

The Prime Minister has led calls for Mr Wright to go, but he has stubbornly refused to quit his £85,000 a year job and is due to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee today.

The latest allegations come from an abuse victim who said he had been given detailed accounts of the shocking crimes in face-to-face meetings with victims more than eight years ago.

The sex-grooming victim told the Times: ‘He seemed genuinely shocked. He talked like he was going to go away and see that something was done, but we never saw him again. It was the end of it for him, but not for us.

‘I sat two feet from him and told him really, really private things. I don’t know how he can go on national television and say he wasn’t aware, that he didn’ t know anything about it. For years they had all the reports and information, but they just ignored it.’

Previously Mr Wright said he was aware child exploitation was happening in Rotherham, but he didn’t realise it was taking place on an ‘industrial scale.’ He also admitted meeting victims and became ‘more aware that there was a problem.’

Mr Wright has been keeping a low-profile since the fallout over Professor Jay’s report led to widespread calls for his resignation.

He is to give evidence at the House of Commons along with Chief Constable David Crompton and Rotherham’s social services boss Joyce Thacker, who have also been widely criticised.

Meanwhile, chief executive Mr Kimber announced his decision to stand down in a statement, repeating his previous admission that the report ‘does not make comfortable reading.’

‘I would like to reiterate my sincere apology to those who were let down when they needed help,’ he said.

PCC Shaun Wright will be quizzed by MPs over allegations he failed to help sex abuse victims in Rotherham

‘The events of the past fortnight will again have been an incredibly traumatic time for them and their families, and have shaken the town as a whole.

‘The council has now decided what it must do to give the best possible protection for the children and young people of Rotherham.

I believe that new leadership will enable the town to recover more quickly from the events of the last two weeks, and strongly signal a new beginning at this critical time in its recovery. The time is therefore now right for me to leave.’
