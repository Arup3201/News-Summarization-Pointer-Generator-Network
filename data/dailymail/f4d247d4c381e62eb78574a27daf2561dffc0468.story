All eyes were on the Duchess of Cambridge this afternoon as she charmed guests at Diamond Jubilee garden party - and scored extra points for recycling a dress she wore two weeks ago.

Notching up another landmark in her life as a royal, crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of Kate as she mingled with poise and elegance at her first Buckingham Palace garden party.

And for the auspicious occasion, clever Kate demonstrated her thrifty side by giving a second outing to the £1,200 Emilia Wickstead dress she wore for the Royal Sovereign's lunch in honour of the Queen's Jubilee at Windsor Castle two weeks ago.

Then, eyebrows were raised after so-called 'High Street Kate', notorious for her love of affordable clothing, chose a current season designer item costing more than the average monthly salary.

But with this second appearance, Kate
has silenced her critics - and proved that she is a thoroughly sensible
royal who is so much more than a mere clothes horse.

She joined the Prince of Wales, 
Duchess of Cornwall, and the Queen for tea and cakes with 8,000 guests 
within the grounds of the royal residence as the family prepares for 
this weekend's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

Kate attended the event without her 
husband, the Duke of Cambridge, who instead remained at RAF Valley on 
Anglesey where he is a search and rescue pilot.

It was the second Palace garden party
of the year and guests from all walks of life enjoyed another warm day 
after the unseasonably hot weather of recent days.

The band struck up the National 
Anthem as the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh appeared at the top of the 
steps and a hush fell over the assembled crowd.

Then applause broke out as the 
couple, along with Charles, Camilla and Kate, made their way towards 
their waiting guests, who were invited after nominations by 
institutions, charities and businesses.

Relaxed: Kate looked utterly at ease at the party, which she attended 
with William, as well as the Queen, Prince Philip and Camilla, chatting 
animatedly to guests

Society favourite: Designer Emilia Wickstead with loyal client Samantha Cameron

British based, New Zealand-born designer Emilia Wickstead has fast become one of the go-to designers for London's high society.

In business just three years, Ms Wickstead has already dressed a number of royals - not least Kate, who wore an emerald Emilia Wickstead coat dress for a St Patrick's Day appearance earlier this year. 

Kate has been spotted various times visiting the atelier in London's Belgravia, and is said to be a great fan of the brand.

Privately, Ms Wickstead is said to be delighted the Kate has shown interest in her collection.

Ms Wickstead also dressed a number of VIP guests invited to last year's Royal Wedding, including Kate's cousin Lucy, Anya Hindmarch, Georgina Cadbury, Lady Kitty Spencer, Emma Parker Bowles and India Hicks, who was a bridesmaid to Princess Diana.

But Emilia's client base is not restricted to the upper echelons royalty.

Ms Wickstead can also count Dannii Minogue and Samantha Cameron as trusted customers, both of whom have worn her designs on many occasions.

Most recently, Samantha Cameron wore multiple pieces from Wickstead's collection on a visit to the U.S. in March.

The designer's spring/summer 2012 collection, a pretty collection in candybox hues, was described by Wickstead herself as being a 'mixture of sophistication and playfulness - fashionable women who entertain'.

Perfectly suited for the Duchess's central role today.

'We are happy, delighted and excited to see Kate in one of our designs, a spokesman for Emilia Wickstead said after the Sovereign's lunch. 'She looked lovely.'
