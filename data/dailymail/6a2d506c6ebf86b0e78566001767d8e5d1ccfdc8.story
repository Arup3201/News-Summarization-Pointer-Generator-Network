He goes by the name of Abu Bakr but the teenager who appeared on national TV wearing the logo of listed terrorist organisation Islamic State last week is actually 19-year-old part-time labourer Sulayman Khalid.

Khalid, who grew up Sydney's southwestern suburbs, is of Iraqi and Italian background and had his  passport revoked by ASIO in December. He was charged on Friday with affray and intimidation in an alleged 'religious hate crime' incident involving a 43-year-old shopping centre cleaner.

His lawyer Zali Burrows told Daily Mail Australia earlier this month that he is simply a 'young kid who is passionate about injustice'.

But the security services have had concerns about the Islamic State supporter for some time.

19-year-old Sydney man Sulyman Khalid, who goes by the name of Abu Bakr, appeared on SBS Insight wearing the Islamic State flag

ASIO cancelled his passport in December when he was identified as one of 20 men who ‘hold an extreme ideology’.

On Saturday, police released information about Khalid’s alleged involvement in the shopping centre dispute. 

They said at about 8pm on August 10 a cleaner was approached by two men at Bankstown shopping centre, in Sydney’s west. He became fearful and security officers were contacted and the men were escorted out of the location.

The two men returned about an hour and a half later and again approached the cleaner who was still working.

Police then arrested Khalid at about 2.45pm on Friday 15 August in Stuart Lane, Bankstown. He was given strict bail conditions to appear at Bankstown Local Court on Wednesday 10 September.

However, Khalid has claimed he was simply walking through the shopping centre after seeing a film with a friend when the cleaner – an Iraqi Christian - made a comment about his vest which was adorned with the Islamic State flag, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The Australian government list the Islamic State as a terrorist organisation.

They say it is an Iraq and Syria-based Sunni extremist group and former al‑Qa'ida affiliate that adheres to the global jihadist ideology.

The Islamic State follows an extreme interpretation of Islam which is anti-Western, promotes sectarian violence and targets those that do not agree with its interpretations as infidels and apostates.

The Islamic State's announcement of a caliphate claims the land from Aleppo in Syria to Diyala in Iraq, the Sunni-dominated areas of both countries. Eventually, it aims to establish a salafist-orientated Islamist state spanning Iraq, Syria and other parts of the Levant.

The cleaner apparently objected to the symbol he was wearing and Khalid claims the cleaner actually threatened him.

In Iraq, Christians and Yazidis are currently being persecuted by supporters of the Islamic State, with thousands of refugees fleeing to seeking shelter in Irbil, Lebanon and Turkey.

The Australian Federal Government recently opened its humanitarian refugee program to Iraqi Christians and Yazidis in response to the crisis.

Khalid’s lawyer, Zali Burrows has argued a ‘verbal dispute’ between two people wouldn’t normally be treated with such important by police

She said there is a ‘witch hunt’ against Khalid since he appeared on the SBS Insight show on August 12 wearing the Islamic State symbol.

'Let’s hope the call to press charges does not further fuel the angry and dangerous mob who are bombarding my client and self with threats,’ she said.

During the SBS show, Khalid wore the Islamic State symbol adorned to a black sleeveless jacket as he sat in the audience and made headlines after he walked off the show’s set part-way through filming.

Burrows said she and Khalid were told the discussion would be about the new anti-terror laws announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

The 19-year-old was reportedly kicked out of the shopping centre by security but allegedly came back an hour-and-a-half later and further abused the cleaner

Instead she said they spent two 'boring' hours talking about fighting in Syria and the Islamic State organisation.

'He was like a lamb brought to slaughter,' Burrows said of her client.

Before the SBS TV discussion, fronted by journalist Jenny Brockie, aired Burrows told Daily Mail Australia her client walked out because 'the whole set up was a farce and they duped guests as to the theme'.

Khalid believes Muslims are obligated to help fellow Muslims overseas and reportedly does not feel connected with his home country of Australia.

'Then again perhaps we should not be worried as nobody watches SBS unless they are looking for soft porn on a Friday night.' she added.

Last week was not the first time Burrows has fallen out with TV execs over their portrayal of her client.

In January this year she managed to stop a TV show where he was interviewed from airing on Channel Seven.

Khaled Sharrouf is one of Australia's most wanted terrorists after fleeing Sydney in December on his brother's passport. He is now reportedly fighting with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria

Burrows won a last-minute injunction in the NSW Supreme Court to prevent Today Tonight running the segment after she told the court she agreed to them interviewing Khalid on the condition that he would have ‘editorial control’ of and the ‘final say’ before it was shown on TV.

She said there had been a breach of contract as she was given the impression the show would focus on the unfairness of the process that led to the cancellation of Khalid’s passport.

Khalid is by no means alone in Sydney with his blatant support for the Islamic State, an Iraq and Syria-based Sunni extremist group and former al Qa'ida affiliate that adheres to the global jihadist ideology.

On August 19 Wissam Haddad, the head of the al-Risalah Islamic Centre in Sydney’s southwest, revealed he too followed the ‘flag of Allah’, the Daily Telegraph reported.

He denounced the Australian flag and said the Shahada, used by Islamic Stat militants, is a flag he will ‘live and die’ for. 

Islamic groups have expressed concerns over proposed new anti-terror powers, as they fear they will be unfairly targeted.

Mr Abbott said Australia faces a serious threat from radicals who travel overseas to fight with terror groups in Syria and Iraq and then become 'militarised and brutalised' by the experience.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott met with community leaders in Sydney at a conference this week after Islamic groups expressed concerns over proposed new anti-terror powers, as they fear they will be unfairly targeted. Mr Abbott said Australia faces a serious threat from radicals who travel overseas to fight with terror groups in Syria and Iraq and then become 'militarised and brutalised' by the experience

He told the conference that the laws were not about protecting 'one group of Australians from another group of Australians', in an apparent reference to concerns from the Muslim community, and said it was in the 'absolute interests' of every community to 'expose and to counter any potential for home-grown terrorism'.

Mr Abbott is concerned that the 150 Australians involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq may bring their radicalised view of Islam back to Australia.

'The last thing we should be is complacent about this,' Mr Abbott said.

Earlier, in an interview with Macquarie Radio, he urged moderate Muslims to join the 'Team Australia' fight against locally-bred extremists.

'We do have to be vigilant against it - and my position is that everyone has got to be on Team Australia,' he said.

'Everyone has got to put this country, its interest and its values and its people first.'

He was also asked about reports that shops in Sydney's southwest were flying Islamic State flags despite the group being listed as a terrorist organisation.

'I don't know what the legal position is, but frankly, the only flag that should be flying is the Australian national flag,' he said.

'If people want to fly other flags - a corporate flag for instance - fine, but the Australian national flag should always be part of it.'

A former NSW counter-terrorism detective, who was a lead investigator in Australia’s biggest ever terror trial in 2005, has told Daily Mail Australia people should be concerned about how young men are becoming indoctrinated in Australia.

Peter Moroney, a lead investigator in Operation Pendennis which originally busted homegrown terrorist Khaled Sharrouf as part of a large terrorist cell planning to carry out attacks in Sydney and Melbourne, said removing peoples' passports won’t change their beliefs.

‘It might stop them from going overseas and fighting but they can still plot attacks from Australia,’ he said.

The 40-year-old explained fighting terrorism is not just an issue for the police, ASIO or the Islamic community.

'It’s not something that's going to go away. People's beliefs don't go away. You're investigating a belief system and what is driving them is their beliefs. It’s not like drug crimes that are motivated by money or greed. It’s hard to police.’  

He also noted that cancelling passports does not necessarily stop people from travelling to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State fighting.

Sharrouf travelled to Syria in December last year by using his brother’s passport, he is now allegedly carrying out beaheadings and posting pictures of severed heads on Twitter.

Just last week immigration officials detained a Sydney teenager as he arrived in Abu Dhabi after using his brother’s passport to fly out of Sydney International Airport.

ASIO reportedly believe the 19-year-old was on his way to Syria and Iraq.

Anthony Whealy QC, the former judge who presided over the trial of the Terror Nine, told Daily Mail Australia in general terms that there are a number of factors that lead younger people on the path of extremism.  

'Sometimes they come under the influence of a fanatical sheik or imam, that's what happened with Khaled Sharrouf. 

'The second thing is a bit of peer pressure from young people who are equally angry and probably a bit equally angry and probably a bit disturbed and deprived.

'Thirdly I think the internet is a form of radicalisation that can't be underestimated.'
