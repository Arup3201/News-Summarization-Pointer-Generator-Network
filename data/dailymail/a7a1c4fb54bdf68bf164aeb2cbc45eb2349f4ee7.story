Police investigating former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne over his speeding points scandal  secretly obtained the phone records of a journalist

Police chiefs have been ordered by the Prime Minister's privacy watchdog to reveal when snooping powers were used to seize journalists’ phone records.

Sir Paul Kennedy, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, launched an inquiry after it emerged forces discover reporters’ confidential sources.

It comes after it emerged police investigating disgraced former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne over the speeding points scandal which ended his career secretly obtained the phone records of a journalist and one of his sources for the story - even though a judge had agreed that the source could remain confidential.

It came after it was previously revealed that Scotland Yard used snooping powers – in Regulation of Investigatory Powers act – to obtain a Sun journalist's phone records to uncover a whistleblower in the Plebgate affair, in which the former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell was accused of calling police ‘plebs’.

Sir Paul said he was concerned ‘about the protection of journalistic sources so as to enable a free press’.

Downing Street said David Cameron believed the ‘right oversight mechanisms’ were in place for monitoring the use of Ripa, but stressed that his approach was to be ‘supportive of our tradition of investigative journalism’.

It comes comes after the Press Gazette launched its ‘Save Our Sources’ campaign, urging the commissioner to take action. A petition as part of the campaign, which was directed at Sir Paul, has attracted more than 1,000 signatures.

Ripa powers enable police forces and other public authorities to obtain telephone data without judicial approval.

It recently emerged that a Kent police officer was granted authorisation to obtain the billing and call data of a Mail on Sunday journalist, alongside his source, who was later unmasked as a freelance journalist.

The pair, whose data were obtained from their landline and mobile phone service providers, had been in discussions with Constance Briscoe, the judge who was investigated by police over a false claim that she had not spoken to the press about the affair.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) initially applied under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (Pace), which enshrines the principle of journalistic privilege and allows journalists and their employers to make representations to the court to protect their sources.

But the judge ruled that while the Mail on Sunday did have to disclose material, it could do so with names of sources redacted.

Unknown to the Mail on Sunday, Kent police secretly went to the journalist's mobile phone provider and ordered the release of records using powers under Ripa, which does not require judicial approval.

Last month it emerged accidentally that Scotland Yard had obtained the Sun's newsdesk telephone records and those of its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, to try to identify who had leaked the Plebgate story about Mr Mitchell's altercation with police at the gates of Downing Street.

Sir Paul said his office would report all findings to the Prime Minister, and publicly, to develop ‘clarity in relation to the scope and compliance of this activity’.

In addition, it was reported the Home Affairs Select Committee has asked every police force in the UK to reveal how many times they have obtained the telephone and email records of journalists without their consent.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the committee, said he wanted a detailed breakdown of police use of Ripa powers to force telecoms companies to hand over phone records without customers' knowledge.

Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The Government needs to urgently address the fact that the Interception of Communications Commissioner has warned that spying powers are being over-used by some police forces.

‘Quite simply, if the police can't get it right with the powers they already have then it is completely irresponsible for the Home Office to be planning on increasing those powers.

‘The inadequacy and inconsistency of the records being kept by public authorities about how they are using these powers is woefully inadequate. Correcting this would not require new laws so it should not wait until after the election.

‘If the Government fails to address these serious points, we can already know that there will be many more innocent members of the public who will be wrongly spied on and accused. This is simply unacceptable.’

Sir Paul is currently acting as interim Interception of Communications Commissioner while Sir Anthony May recovers from a serious accident at the beginning of July.
