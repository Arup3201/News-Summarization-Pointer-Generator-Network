Last year, 12-year-old Max LaDue missed over 100 days of school due to a painful gastrointestinal syndrome. 

While the seventh-grader's health issues are still not over, his life is beginning to return to normal thanks to a robot that allows him to attend classes and socialize with his peers all from the comfort of his home.

This year, LaDue became the first student in North Carolina to use a VGO Telerobot, a robot which he can steer from class to class to watch lectures and even interact with his teachers and classmates via a webcam that transmits his image on the robot's screen. If LaDue wants to ask or answer a question, he simply pushes a button which flashes a light, alerting his teacher.

State of the art: The Durham Public Schools became the first school district in North Carolina to invest in VGO Telerobots this year, which allow sick kids to attend school from home. The robots cost $12,000 each

'Being there makes it much easier than not being there. I'm a very hands-on kind of person,' Max told WNCN. 'I feel like I'm very lucky to get such an experience, because otherwise I'd just be sitting here 12 hours a day doing absolutely nothing.'

The Durham Public Schools was the first district in the state to invest in the cutting-edge technology, buying three of the $12,000 robots for sick students. One of the robots is being used by a little girl with a compromised immune system, who now gets to attend kindergarten and socialize with children her age for the first time.

Chrissy Pearson, chief communications officer for the school district, told Fox News that they are proud to be the first to invest in the robots for their students. 

'One of the things we started noticing was that there were kids who really wanted to be in school but couldn’t for medical reasons,' Pearson said. 'Max is the perfect candidate for this new technology. It’s just been really inspiring to watch him.'

Back to school: 12-year-old Max LaDue is one of three students using a VGO  in Durham Public Schools. He steers his from home to attend two classes a day at the School of Creative Studies, a magnate school

Not missing out: Max is even able to ask his teachers a question by pressing a button which flashes a light to draw attention to his camera 

Just like everyone else: Above, Max is seen sitting in on a class, listening to the teacher's lecture alongside another student 

For Max, missing out on school was even more disappointing since he won a spot to the School of Creative Studies through a lottery.

Now he's back at the magnate school to attend four different classes, two each day, which he supplements with an at-home math class and home-bound tutor provided to him through the  Durham Public Schools Hospital School. 

Max's mother Julie says the technology has made a world of difference in her son's life.  

'It was almost like homework prison for him before, and now, he's doing projects with kids. He's collaborating on things with other kids at school,' Julie LaDue told ABC 11. 'I want my child to be a normal kid and the VGO lets him be a normal kid.'
