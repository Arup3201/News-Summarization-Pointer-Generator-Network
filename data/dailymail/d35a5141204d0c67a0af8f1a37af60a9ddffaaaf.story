A football club admin worker who sent racy pictures to a player is also rumoured to have had a fling with the goalkeeper who went on to become a WWE wrestler, a tribunal has heard.

Kerry Miller, 46, is accused of repeatedly barging into the changing rooms at Burton Albion FC while players were getting dressed after post-match showers.

A tribunal heard how she entered the dressing room on 15 occasions and also sent pictures of herself wearing underwear to striker Billy Kee, 23.

She confessed to having a 'casual' relationship with former defender Ryan Austin, 29, who has since left the League Two club.

On the third day of her employment tribunal today, the hearing heard of allegations of rumours she had been seeing 28-year-old goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson between September and Christmas 2012.

Leicester Employment Tribunal heard she posted a picture on Facebook of herself with the model on a night out just hours after a crucial match.

The following year Tomlinson turned his back on football after suffering a bad knee injury to pursue a career in WWE wrestling in America.

Giving evidence the club’s chairman Ben Robinson said Mr Tomlinson was a part-time male escort while he played for the team.

Asked if he was aware there were rumours of a relationship between the pair by her barrister James Bruce, Mr Robinson said: 'I was aware that it was suspected. I was aware of the discussion that Kerry might have been having a relationship with Stuart Tomlinson between September and Christmas.

'He was a male model and a male escort. I’ve had no problems with that.'

Burton Albion’s club secretary and commercial director Fleur Robinson said she had spoken to Ms Miller after she posted an image of the pair together in a Chester night-club .

Giving evidence Ms Robinson, who is also the chairman’s daughter, admitted she had 'raised an eyebrow' when the picture emerged on October 27, 2012 - just hours after a crucial game.

She told the tribunal: 'It was a Saturday and we had a home game against Bradford.

'Kerry had asked if she would be able to leave earlier than expected because she had to go out in Manchester.

'I said that was fine as long as everything was done by that time. I had no issues with her leaving an hour early.

'I remember sitting at home on the Saturday evening with my partner. I had a message off my brother saying have you seen this on Facebook?

'I thought it was a bit strange she had asked to go early to go to Manchester and seeing that picture I admit I raised an eyebrow.

'Kerry came to see me on the Thursday and said she wasn’t very happy about the way things had been dealt with over the weekend.

'I said being seen out in a nightclub with an injured player probably wouldn’t be perceived very well by our supporters and sponsors and people connected with the club.

'I know Kerry was friends with other colleagues and one of the second major sponsors was a friend of hers on Facebook at the time.

'I asked her to be careful in future as to what she was doing in terms of any connections with any staff that could be in the social arena.

'I think we regret that we didn’t deal with things in a more formal manner.'

Ms Robinson, who has worked at the club for 18 years and was Ms Miller’s line manager, also told the hearing she warned her after manager Gary Rowett complained about her bursting into the dressing rooms.

She added: 'I had a conversation with Kerry and I said I had a conversation with the manager and a phone call with the chairman that a complaint had been made by a senior player about her entering the dressing room.

'I asked her if this was the case and she said it wasn’t.

'As the conversation developed Kerry admitted she had entered the dressing room.

'It was certainly on more than one occasion and the manager said to me it was on several occasions.

'It’s something I’ve never had to deal with in 18 years at the club.

'A female member of staff or any member of staff entering the players’ dressing room when they were in states of undress is completely unheard of.

'I was told by the manager that she had gone in unannounced.'

The widow started working in a sales and support role at the club’s Pirelli Stadium in Burton-upon-Trent, Stafforshire, in September 2011 before she quit in February 2013 after a row with the chairman.

Ms Miller, who lives in Marchington near Uttoxeter, denies bursting into the players’ dressing rooms before knocking.

She is claiming constructive dismissal, sexual discrimination and harassment against the club who she is accusing of forcing her to quit.

Burton Albion deny all her claims.

The tribunal today heard how Ms Miller was a 'desperate' flirt who thrived on male attention and was viewed as a threat by Burton Albion's WAGs.

Veteran defender Aaron Webster, 32, told the hearing Ms Miller would be constantly around the players on a daily basis and at one time was 'all over' the club chairman.

Giving evidence, Mr Webster - who made 589 appearances and scored 101 goals for the club in 16 years before he left last summer - said: 'Kerry likes male attention. In my opinion she would flirt very directly with male staff and players on a regular and daily basis.

'She came around the dressing room and the physio room in the morning. During lunchtime she would be around the players.

'At one period we did see her quite frequently. I'm not 100 per cent sure why she would be there.

'Some of the girlfriends saw Kerry as a bit of a threat. She was all over the chairman on one occasion.

'If I'm honest I felt it was a little bit desperate from her at times. According to me I think she liked the male attention so if there was any whistles or noises from the players she would like it.

'That's why I personally think we saw her on a daily basis. I thought she thrived on that. I've seen pictures on two players phones - Ryan Austin and Billy Kee.

'I heard she had a thing for him [Stuart Tomlinson] but I never heard a rumour they had slept together.'

Burton striker Billy Kee told the tribunal yesterday afternoon how Ms Miller sent him  pictures in which she was topless.

The 23-year-old, who still plays for the club, admitted he also sent two naked pictures of himself to Ms Miller after a night out in 2012.

He told the hearing he didn't remember how they started texting but he remembered the messages started getting sexual after he 'drank a few pints'.

Asked if he had sent two naked pictures, both not including his face, to Ms Miller by the club's barrister Sarah George, the striker simply answered 'yes'.

And then asked if he received one snap of Ms Miller in her underwear and then another of her topless Mr Kee again replied 'yes'.

Giving evidence he told the hearing: 'I remember I was on a night out and I don't know how we got texting but we ending up exchanging pictures. I think it was two from each side.

'I don't remember what words were used but if I was going to do it with someone else I would say "you send me one and I'll send you one back".

'I know it started as just innocent chit-chat. I think after a few pints it may have got sexual but I honestly don't remember.  The next day I received a text from her.

'I think she said "I'm silly for sending them and I would appreciate it if you deleted them because it could cost me my job".

'I showed them [the photos] to a few players, four including the physio. A couple of other players said "come on mate, you shouldn't be doing that".'

Burton Albion's accounts manager Angela Lawley also told the tribunal Ms Miller was texting another married player from another professional club.

She said the player - who was not named - also had children and would keep the phone he used to text Ms Miller hidden in his car's glove-box.

The hearing, which is expected to last another two days, continues.
