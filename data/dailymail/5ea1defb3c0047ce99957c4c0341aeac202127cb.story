Forget the Crab Nebula, the Cat’s Eye Nebula, and the Face on Mars, this penguin is the new addition to the growing menagerie which astronomers claim to have found identifies in distant skies. 

This striking image of two galaxies colliding, taken with the Nasa Hubble Space 
Telescope, shows what looks like the profile of a celestial bird, 
hovering protectively over an egg.

But both are fully certified galaxies which can be found in the constellation Hydra, 326million light years away.

The 'penguin' as Nasa experts have likened it to, is the star-forming spiral galaxy NGC 2936 and would normally look very much like the Milky Way - a flat, spiral disk.

But the orbits of the galaxy's stars have become scrambled due to gravitational tidal interactions with the other galaxy,  NGC 2937, positioned to the lower left.

The egg shaped galaxy has pulled and elongated the spiral with its gravity, forcing the galaxy's shape to completely reform.

The penguin is among a number of 'animal inspired' shapes which astronomers have noted int he night skies, including the Cat's Eye Nebula

This image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows the entire Crab Nebula, which was first observed by the Chinese nearly 1000 years ago

Gas and dust drawn from the heart of NGC 2936 becomes compressed during the encounter, which in turn triggers star formation.

These bluish knots are visible along the distorted arms that are closest to the companion elliptical.

The reddish dust, once within the galaxy, has been thrown out of the galaxy's plane and into dark veins that are silhouetted against the bright starlight from what is left of the nucleus and disk.

The companion elliptical, NGC 2937, is a puffball of stars with little gas or dust present.

The beautiful, but distorted shapes are usually caused when two or more galaxies venture too close to each other, 'exchanging matter and causing havoc'.
