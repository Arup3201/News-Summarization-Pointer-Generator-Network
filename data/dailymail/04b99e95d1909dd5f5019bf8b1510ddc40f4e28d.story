When it comes to opening himself to ridicule, Nick Clegg appears to need no help.

But yesterday it was his wife’s words that caused titters at the Deputy Prime Minister’s expense.

Miriam Gonzalez Durantez told an interviewer: ‘Women have been faking lots of things during history’.

In a light-hearted response to a question about how schoolgirls could be more confident, the 46-year-old Spaniard said with a laugh: ‘My answer to them is always, “Look, if you don’t have it, you fake it”.'

She added: ‘Women have been faking lots of things during history. So if you are going to fake something, fake self-confidence.’

Miss Gonzalez Durantez – a highly successful corporate lawyer – was speaking on the first anniversary of the launch of her Inspiring the Future: Inspiring Women campaign.

She told the London Evening Standard that although her husband went to exclusive Westminster School, she wants her children – Miguel, 12, Antonio, seven, and Alberto, five – to go through the state school system.

She added: ‘Everyone picks on Eton, but it is a serious point. If you dress in tailcoats it doesn’t make you any cleverer, but it makes you feel part of an elite.

‘This is the 21st Century. You cannot buy your place into the elite. You have to earn it. There is not a shortcut. Whether you are at Eton, or [a state school in] Islington, you have to work – you cannot bluff forever.’

She said she ‘cannot understand’ why a state-educated girl should ‘feel that she is any less than a boy who dresses up in tailcoats to learn maths’.

Miss Gonzalez Durantez – who is reported to earn far more than Mr Clegg’s £134,565 salary – wants to see women make the best careers they can and is campaigning to introduce girls to a broad range of female role models.

She also said last night she feared women would be turned away from certain school subjects due to preconceived ideas, adding: ‘Lots give up maths and science – what they call “hard subjects” – because they think that they will look like geeks, or that they are not going to be attractive to boys’.

She said she wanted to make these subjects ‘cool’ through her campaign, which aims to sign up 15,000 volunteers to talk to 250,000 girls about their careers.

Miss Gonzalez Durantez has long refused to play the role of typical politician’s wife. Earlier this month, she shunned party conference tradition by not kissing her husband on stage after his keynote speech.
