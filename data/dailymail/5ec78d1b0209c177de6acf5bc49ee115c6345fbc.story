Many New Yorkers spent their time indoors during Hurricane Irene playing board games, watching re-runs of American Idol or just being plain bored.

But one 25-year-old mother decided to create a Twitter feed joking about New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's attempts to speak Spanish - and it’s already been a roaring success.

Rachel Figueroa-Levin, of Inwood, New York, created @ElBloombito to make fun of when Mayor Bloomberg answers questions at press conferences in broken Spanish.

'El Bloombito': Rachel Figueroa-Levin created the Twitter account to make fun of when New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, left, answers questions at press conferences in broken Spanish

Her best tweets include: ‘Por Favor to reporte los trees que knocked over by llamanding los 311 con removal por el ciudad’; and ‘Los trainos y el bussos son muy operationo. Go to worko. No excuso!’

Others include: 'Los regulationitos para el cleano del calle esta remaindo suspenamundo. Que parko anywhere!'; and 'Necesito helpayudo para el cleanup del Irene!'

Ms Figueroa-Levin mocked Mayor Bloomberg for his ‘laughable’ Spanish, but his efforts to connect with the huge Hispanic community in New York have been generally seen positively.

She has only been tweeting on the account since Saturday, but already has more than 12,000 followers.

It seems Mayor Bloomberg also sees the 
funny side, as when he was asked about the account in a press conference
by a journalist, he replied in Spanish before concluding: ‘Es 
suficiente?’

Ms Figueroa-Levin admitted it is ‘great that he wants to speak Spanish’ and told the New York Observer his administration handled the storm preparation ‘very well’. But she doesn’t think he should have spoken the language at all.

‘I think that if he really wanted to get
a message across to the Latino community he should have stepped aside 
and had someone who speaks Spanish fluently deliver the message,’ she 
said.

Ms Figueroa-Levin got the ‘El Bloombito’
name from picturing NY1 political commentator Gerson Borrero saying the
name, in a similar vein to how he usually calls Mayor Bloomberg 
‘Miguelito’.

She told the New York Observer that his 
Spanish ‘gave me a laugh - which I needed being stuck in an apartment 
with a fussy baby’ and her Puerto Rican father speaks the language 
fluently.

Good fun: Mayor Bloomberg, left, also sees the funny side of the account by Rachel Figueroa-Levin, right

‘I can feed the baby with one hand and 
tweet on my phone with the other,’ she said, pointing out that she 
accredits her wit to her late grandfather.

Mayor Bloomberg can certainly count on 
her vote, as she has already voted for him and would ‘probably vote for 
him again’. She will continue tweeting on the account ‘as long as it 
stays fun’.

Two of his best responses in 'Spanglish' to questions at press conferences reportedly included the phrases 'the streets have cleaned' and 'it was a lot of windy'.

Ms Figueroa-Levin, an artisan soap-maker originally from Staten Island, New York, lives in Inwood with her husband Mike and nine-month-old daughter Adiella.
