Experts have become the first people to board the Costa Concordia cruise liner since it sank off the coast of Isola del Giglio, Italy, in an attempt to investigate whether there are more facts about the ship's sinking left to be discovered.

The team of investigators is to do a full sweep of the ship in order to see if there is any information about its sinking that isn't contained in the prosecutor's case against its captain.

Any information found could potentially add to the defence of Captain Francesco Shettino, who has been under intense scrutiny since the ship sank on January 13, 2012, killing 32 people.

A great deal of the ship is rusting away, as it has been sitting off of the coast for over two years. A large part of the ship was under the ocean for a long period of time, as shown by the damage to its balconies. One of the key areas of interest is the ship's backup generator, which failed when the ship first wrecked.

Today the team examined the the bridge and lifts in the ship, investigating whether there were any factors present at the time of the shipwreck, beyond human error, that could have contributed to it sinking.

Next month the experts are planning to examine the cruise liner's emergency generator.

A judge granted the request for the onboard evaluation to collect evidence sought by Schettino's defence, as well as evidence required by a consumer group representing victims of the shipwreck.

Shettino is currently the only person who has been put on trial, but his defence, among others, claim that Costa Crociere SpA, the ships owner, bear some of the responsibility.

The former captain of the ship is currently the only person on trial since the ship sank. As a part of their sweep, experts are examining the lifts of the Costa Concordia first, but it is only a small part of their entire investigation

The cost for the towing and salvaging operation for the giant wreck is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions, providing a lucrative contract for the company that eventually gets the offer

A week ago the waters around the Costa Concordia were full of coats containing the relatives of victims of the wreck, who joined together at the behest of the authorities to hold a vigil in remembrance

The captain is currently standing trial in the Tuscan town of Grosseto, having been charged with multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship.

The experts will be the first to explore the ship since it was wrecked over two years ago, only a week after survivors and relatives of victims held a vigil on January 13 in remembrance.

The 114,000-ton ship was finally removed from the rocks last September in the most expensive salvage operation of its kind, and currently stands on 1,000 concrete stacks and six underwater platforms that are being used to keep it stable.

Soon, the vessel will be towed away and dismantled, an operation thought to cost £496 million by the time it is removed.

Earlier this month it was revealed a British port is in the running to dismantle the ship. Able Seaton Port on Teeside, near Hartlepool, has been asked to submit a proposal for the vast demolition project, which is expected to take 200 people two years to complete. It estimated value of the contract is more than €300 million.

Earlier this month there were rumours that a British company stood a good chance of netting the contract for salvaging the wreck, as they were asked to prepare and present a proposition to the authorities for the specifications of their potential operation

This trip by experts and legal officials is the first of many which hopes to gain evidence, if any, of circumstances beyond human error that might have led to the shipwreck

The wreck of the Costa Concordia does not sit that far off the coast, which has made it a target for people wishing to salvage it illegally. This has meant that authorities have had to keep an eye on it
