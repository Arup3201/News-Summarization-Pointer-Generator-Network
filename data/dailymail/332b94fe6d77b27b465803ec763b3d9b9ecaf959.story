Snowfall has caused the  closure of many schools and if the poor weather continues, they will remain shut next week. But why do we educate our children in schools? I think we have lost sight of their purpose, and the cold snap gives us a chance to think afresh.

While at home, the children can catch up on the news on Jimmy Savile and his depravities, cyclist Lance Armstrong, who deceived the world with his drug-taking, and Katie Price, the good-time girl who last week married a man on the advice of a psychic. These and other ‘characters’ like them exert huge influence on the nation.

In truth, they are just paper-thin personalities. The rot set in with the publication of Dale Carnegie’s How To Win Friends And Influence People in 1936, which put superficial personality skills above deeper virtues. It opened the cult of the personality, where  people are judged not by who they are but how they present themselves.

Helping pupils flourish: Master of Wellington College Anthony Seldon

We can trace good character traits back to the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who argued that society will flourish only when we develop the virtues of our young.

Traditional values include courage, resilience, loyalty, honesty, kindness, respect, responsibility and self-control.

To these we might add everyday qualities: politeness, punctuality, good manners. Studies show that these can be taught, and that they endure throughout life.

Families have a role to play, but so do schools. Last year, the University of Birmingham founded the Jubilee Centre to study the development of good character.

The research shows conclusively that good character traits are better predictors of academic and economic success and happiness than raw IQ.

In the US, a branch of schools called Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) focus on developing character, with high success rates. Each child is given a ‘character report card’, designed to show their traits improving over time.

Developing character requires teachers to emphasise positive virtues, and to model them. Self-control is learnt through exercises that reward endurance, such as long hikes. Assemblies must highlight good behaviour and students should be trusted and taught to distinguish right from wrong.

Older pupils should be given real responsibilities. Kindness must be emphasised, and all students given chances to volunteer and serve others.

'Characters' like Katie Price exert a huge influence on the nation

But the Government cares only for improving academic standards, measured by the passing of exams.

Don’t get me wrong, high standards are  fundamental, and Education Secretary Michael Gove and Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw are changing the landscape of British schooling.

But their vision is sadly incomplete. The obsession with exams has caused schools to narrow what they offer, because teachers know they are being judged on academic results alone.

The Government wants a ‘Big Society’ and strong communities. They have initiated a ‘decade of social action’, and  the National Citizen Service, a voluntary programme for 16-year-olds. All excellent, but too little.

Just this week, we have heard that parents are raising children ‘in captivity’ because of paranoia about safety: rather than facing character-forming challenges, they are mollycoddled.

Meanwhile, Baroness Meacher suggests changes to current drugs laws. As a headmaster who has seen pupils die from drugs, we need to do far more to help our young have the character to say ‘no’. We cannot leave it to families.

Does the Government really think employers and universities want people who can pass tests, but lack the ability to think creatively, or the discipline to contribute? Protest about the lack of character in school leavers is rising to a cacophony.

At my own school, Wellington College, our young must abide by five values which they themselves chose: courage, integrity, kindness, responsibility and respect. They are taught self-control and endurance; working in teams on the games field and in the cadet force, learning to overcome their limitations and obey instructions.

Since we started teaching well-being five years ago, where pupils learn to develop resilience, exam performance has rocketed – from 65 per cent A and B grades at A-level to 93 per cent.

Listen Mr Gove! The Government's obsession with exam results is damaging young people for life

But it is not just independent schools. From Kings Langley School in Hertfordshire to the Science Academy in Bradford, the best state schools are concentrating on character, with startling success. King Solomon Academy in London, which has a strong uniform code, celebrates good manners, and teaches each child to aspire, has been transformed in just a few years.

Governments want to show that they have significantly bolstered results and league table performance. But society has a longer time-frame, and needs young people to become kind, law-abiding, creative citizens.

On Wednesday, I am giving a lecture at the Jubilee Centre on the neglect of character education in our schools, and how this is selling society short.

The Government is damaging young people for life because of its obsession with exam results – and making a mockery of its claim to be building a Big Society. Listen, please, Mr Gove!
