Southern chef, Paula Deen, 68, is set to return to the airwaves after launching a new daily radio show

Disgraced TV chef Paula Deen is set to take over the airwaves with a new daily radio show.

The Southern chef, 68, was a popular host on the Food Network for over 13 years before she was sacked over a racism scandal.

As well as the daily radio show, Get Cooking with Paul Deen, she will also produce a weekly podcast. 

'I had my first day in the studio yesterday and we had so much fun! I cannot wait to bring my vignettes and podcast to listeners around America,' Deen, 68, reportedly told PEOPLE 

'I have a ton of fun tips up my sleeve to make their life a little easier.'

Her one minute long daily show will feature tips to help fans both in the kitchen and in life and her live 30-minute weekly show will also include creative director Brandon Branch.

The new podcast will be launched on May 1.  

The celebrity chef, who counted billionaire Oprah Winfrey as one of her close friends has had a tumultuous few years mired by a race hate scandal. 

In 2012, a former manager at Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia, sued her and her brother for sexual and racial harassment.

Lisa T Jackson's lawsuit alleged that Deen and Bubba committed violence, discrimination and racism which ended her five-year employment at Deen's Lady & Sons and Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House eateries in Savannah. 

In a deposition in court, Deen acknowledged using the ‘N word,’ but not telling racial jokes. 

In June 2013, she issued a grovelling, tearful video apology for her use of the word.

‘I want to apologize to everybody for the wrong that I've done,’ Deen said in the video statement.

‘I want to learn and grow from this. Inappropriate and hurtful language is totally, totally unacceptable. I've made plenty of mistakes along the way but I beg you, my children, my team, my fans, my partners, I beg for your forgiveness.’

N-word: The celebrity chef counted billionaire Oprah Winfrey as one of her close friends but has had a tumultuous few years mired by a race hate scandal

Since then, her vast food empire has taken a hit and many of her fans have deserted her.

She was dropped by The Food Network and a host of other sponsors. 

In the wake of the scandal fans sent origami-folded butter wrappers to the Food Network and other companies that dropped the popular chef and cookbook author as a sign of protest.

In February last year she told People magazine: ‘I feel like 'embattled' or 'disgraced' will always follow my name.’

‘It's like that black football player who recently came out,’ she said, referring to Michael Sam.

‘He (Sam) said, 'I just want to be known as a football player. I don't want to be known as a gay football player.' I know exactly what he's saying.’
