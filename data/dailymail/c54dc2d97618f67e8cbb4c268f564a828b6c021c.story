Crunch time. That’s how Dylan Hartley views the month ahead for England. He is well aware of the profound significance of the next four Tests at Twickenham in the run-up to the World Cup.

The hooker and Northampton captain knows it is high time that the national team begin to establish a thunderous momentum as they build towards the home tournament which will define their careers.

Stuart Lancaster’s men must attempt to do so against the might of the Southern Hemisphere, while the one encounter with supposedly lesser opposition pits them against Samoa - comfortably the strongest of the tier two nations.

It has reached a tipping point for England. They go into the QBE series on the back of a 3-0 defeat on their summer tour of New Zealand. They stood toe-to-toe with the All Blacks but couldn’t quite beat them and now Steve Hansen’s world champions are the first November visitors, on Saturday.

England have beaten New Zealand only seven times, with the 38-21 win at Twickenham in 2012 standing out as the record victory.

However, since then England have lost four in a row against the All Blacks. 

The stakes could scarcely be higher. No wonder Hartley sees the four weeks ahead in such stark terms. ‘It is getting down to crunch time now,’ he said. ‘We play Australia this series and next time we play Australia it is going to actually mean something.

‘It’s the same with Wales in the Six Nations. It is going to mean something so it is time to perform. Performance is the key word — hopefully the result comes with performance but performance is key for this whole series.

‘It would be nice to win all four but as long as we are performing and playing well, hopefully results come with that. This autumn series is going to be a step up.’

After the opening game against the All Blacks come the formidably powerful South Africans to confront an England team missing five Lions among their tight forwards, a worrying predicament with such a brutally physical contest in mind.

For Lancaster, losing both opening games would be a doomsday scenario, leaving his side on a run of five Test defeats just when they need to be making their HQ a place to be feared by all comers. At least one win from those two is vital with the bigger picture in mind.

After Samoa, the autumn finale against Australia will serve as an important dry-run for the same fixture at the same venue in the pool stage of the World Cup. That match is about laying down a marker for the main event next year, against rivals who are in a state of flux.

Five months ago England narrowly failed to undermine the All Blacks’ global supremacy. A weakened team dominated the hosts in their Auckland stronghold before losing 20-15 and a week later in Dunedin, Lancaster’s team lost by just a point after a stirring fightback.

In the final Test England were routed in Hamilton, but they still had ample cause for hope amid the rubble. According to Hartley, there was further proof that New Zealand are not unbeatable — as South Africa subsequently proved in the Rugby Championship.

‘We take confidence but saying that, those Tests were at the end of our season,’ he said. ‘We were a little bit disjointed but that was the first time they had met up. It is the other way around now. They have been together for two months so they will be a well-oiled machine, but they are not invincible. People have run them close just like we did and beaten them.’

The grim night in Hamilton is one that Hartley, who was being watched by members of his family from nearby Rotorua, would like to erase from his memory.

He added: ‘I want to forget about it. We got caught at the start and gave them three tries in 20 minutes. If you don’t front up early against the All Blacks they are going to run riot. Ultimately, what sticks in my mind is that we performed really well in the first two games and there is no reason why we can’t do that next week.’

For England, one powerful factor which will drive them on this month is the shattering memory of having landmark achievements snatched from them in cruel fashion.

At the start of last season’s Six Nations they were closing on victory in Paris until a late lapse allowed Gael Fickou to score the try which ultimately prevented a first English Grand Slam since 2003. And in Auckland, it was Conrad Smith’s 78th-minute strike which denied the visitors the famous result that they emphatically deserved.

Those episodes will keep the motivational fires raging. Hartley recognises the power of pain, from his experiences with Northampton. ‘If it hadn’t been for the last two minutes against France that competition (Six Nations) is completely different,’ he said. ‘Experiences like losing in France and losing at Eden Park in the last few minutes — that can only be good for the team.

‘At Northampton we lost three semi-finals, three years in a row, we lost the Heineken Cup final, we lost a Premiership final and I got red-carded. There are all these team things and these personal things. A few of us suffered like that, which is quite nice to have in the back of your head.’

Next weekend the Saints skipper is destined to line up as England’s only available first-choice front-rower in the absence of Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Tom Youngs and Mako Vunipola. Lancaster is also without injured locks Geoff Parling, Joe Launchbury and Ed Slater and flanker Tom Croft. Up front, the Red Rose stocks are depleted but Hartley believes they are still well-equipped to fight the good fight.

‘We are blessed at the moment in the England pack because we have depth,’ he said. ‘Anyone can come in and play. Look at Dave Attwood — he has been having a storming season. It’s unfortunate for some lads when they get injured but you need that experience of people playing these games now and being able to fill in if required.’

England are likely to exhaust their reserves over the next four weeks. It promises to be gruelling and enthralling and momentous. By the end of it, the World Cup host nation need their Sweet Chariot to be at full throttle, not stalling and in need of a service.
