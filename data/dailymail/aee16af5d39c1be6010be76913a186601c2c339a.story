If there was a textbook on Jose Mourinho’s management style, the antics of Chelsea’s players against Paris Saint-Germain would be page one.

Surrounding the referee, complaining about decisions, elbows, and intimidation. Save for the poor result, it had all the hallmarks of a Mourinho classic.

However, if the histrionics start to outweigh performances the Portuguese has a habit of losing favour fast. It’s what killed his reign at Real Madrid.

One of the battles Mourinho fought at Real was with the club’s own match delegate Miguel Porlan. ‘Chendo’, as he is known to everyone, played for over a decade at right-back for Madrid before continuing to serve the club after hanging up his boots.

As part of the staff allowed to sit on the bench during games alongside goalkeeping coach Silvino Louro, fitness coach Rui Faria, and Mourinho’s No 2 and current Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka, Chendo soon became part of the systematic applying of pressure on the fourth official.

It was understood that Mourinho liked his assistants to rotate the badgering of match officials so to limit the likelihood any one individual would be sent off. Chendo, who respected – and was respected by – Mourinho, thought the tactic was below a club like Real Madrid.

Spanish daily El Pais claimed he told his manager as much saying: ‘We don’t do that kind of thing here’, and also suggested it was common knowledge among the players that Chendo hated the role so much he would often approach the fourth official and appear to remonstrate with him when really he was just asking him if he had the time, or if knew what time Madrid’s big department store El Corte Inglés opened in the morning.

Mourinho has always believed matches are won not just by the eleven on the pitch but by everyone at the club. And neither are they just won with football. If the opposition can be intimidated and bullied – and if that affects their ability to play – then that serves the end-game goal of victory.

Mourinho’s ‘us against them’ battle plan at Madrid lasted three years. It left many at the club burned-out and almost relieved when it was replaced by the calm bought by Carlo Ancelotti, but it cannot be said that it did not bring trophies.

It’s true that he never reached the Champions League final at the club but he did win the Spanish Cup in his first season and La Liga in his second. That might have been small fare in any other era but against the best Barcelona team in history it can’t be seen that way.

The third season at the Bernabeu that produced no trophies came when there were perhaps more dissenting voices inside the dressing room than there were players prepared to do it Jose’s way. The key to Mourinho’s success is that everybody rows to the same rhythm – once a couple of galley members have downed oars there are problems.

On the pitch players often had to curtail their instincts to try to just out-play the opposition by surrendering to an overall plan to out-strategize them too. The beginnings of the fall-outs with Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos came because they believed, having won the World Cup with Spain, they could match Barcelona for football. Others, such as Xabi Alonso, sided with Mourinho believing that they would never out-play Pep Guardiola’s team and they had to be cleverer.

Part of Mourinho’s belief that it would take more than just football to beat Barca came from his experience at Inter. They beat Guardiola’s Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Champions League on their way to beating Bayern Munich in the final but they did it with their centre-forward at full-back as an early sending off for Thiago Motta left them with most of the game having to play with 10 men.

His victory jig on the pitch that night interrupted only by the Nou Camp sprinklers and Victor Valdes trying to usher him off the pitch is one of the images of his career and it set the tone for his time at Madrid but it didn’t always work.

In Mourinho’s first season, and just after one of his greatest triumphs with Real beating Barca in the Copa del Rey final 1-0 courtesy of a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, Barcelona and Madrid were drawn together again in the semi-finals of the Champions League.

The players were flying believing that after their cup final success they now had the measure of Barcelona. But Mourinho thought otherwise and set his team up in the first leg at the Bernabeu to not lose.

They would defend stubbornly and in numbers and frustrate Barcelona before going for them in the latter stages of the match. If they scored a late goal to put them ahead in the tie then perfect; if not then a 0-0 would be a good result to take back to the Nou Camp where without an away goal and bound to go on the attack, Barca would leave themselves open on the break.

Ronaldo was one of the dissenters famously putting his hands on his hips and looking to the heavens when during one period of the first half he found himself the only man pressing Barcelona’s defenders. The rest were obeying orders to sit back and not be drawn out of position.

The plan may well have worked to perfection but Pepe was sent off in the second half after clashing with Dani Alves and against 10 men Messi scored twice to leave Real with no chance in the second leg.

Mourinho recovered his players’ faith and winning the league the following season was his greatest achievement in Spain.

Opinion is still divided over his legacy. One television station in Spain suggested this week that Mourinho was among three candidates to replace Ancelotti along with Zinedine Zidane and Jurgen Klopp. Others shook their heads at the incredulity of the idea he will ever return.

The purists tut-tutted their way through that league winning campaign shaking their heads at those lightning counter-attacks so brutally effective but lacking the refinery of Barcelona’s 20-pass moves to goal. But it worked because Madrid and Mourinho won. It’s when it no longer works - as it didn’t for Chelsea on Wednesday - is it really called into question.
