While America’s wealthiest citizens continue to outpace their global peers, the country’s middle class has lost its long held distinction of being the most affluent in the world according to new research.

Although economic growth in the United States continues to be as strong as in many other countries - or stronger - only a small percentage of American households are fully benefiting from it, according to the LIS analysis.

Based on surveys conducted over the past 35 years, income across the lower- and middle-income tiers of American society has plateaued over that time, while citizens in other advanced countries have received considerably larger rises.

Catching up: The gap in middle class wealth between Europeans and those in the United States is rapidly narrowing

Canada’s middle class was substantially lagging behind the U.S. back in 2000, but it caught up in 2010 and has since surpassed the U.S.

In Western Europe, the average incomes still trail those the United States, but the gap in several countires such as Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden is much smaller than it was a decade ago. 

The income data were compiled by researcher from the LIS who analyzed date from the Luxembourg Income Study database in connection with The New York Times.

If the middle class are having a bad time, then the poor in the United States have it even worse.

Canada¿s middle class was substantially lagging behind the U.S. back in 2000, but it caught up in 2010 and has since surpassed the U.S

A family at the 20th percentile of the income distribution in this country now makes significantly less money than a similar family in Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland or the Netherlands. The reverse was true 35 years ago.

In 2010, Median per capita income was $18,700 in the United States, up 20 percent since 1980 but virtually unchanged since 2000, after adjusting for inflation.

By comparison, median per capita income increased 20 percent in Britain between 2000 and 2010 and 14 percent in the Netherlands.

Median income also rose 20 percent in Canada between 2000 and 2010, to $18,700.

Although economic growth in the United States continues to be as strong as in many other countries - or stronger - only a small percentage of American households are fully benefiting from it

Yet according to one of the most commonly cited economic statistics - per capita gross domestic product - the U.S. continues to maintain its lead as the world’s richest large country.

Most Americans aren't keeping pace with their counterparts around the world because a large share of recent income gains is flowing to a small slice of high-earning households.

‘The idea that the median American has so much more income than the middle class in all other parts of the world is not true these days,’ Harvard economist Lawrence Katz told the Times.

‘In 1960, we were massively richer than anyone else. In 1980, we were richer. In the 1990s, we were still richer.’

That is no longer the case, he added.
