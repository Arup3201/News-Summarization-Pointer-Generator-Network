You would expect cardiac rehabilitation sessions to deal in matters of the heart, but one couple took things further - and ended up getting married.

Tracey Caine, 50, and 56-year-old husband Trevor had both suffered heart attacks within days of each other last June and were sent to weekly exercise and information classes at Royal Bolton Hospital in greater Manchester.

As the months went by their love blossomed and this week the got married.

The pair smile and exchange a kiss on their wedding day. The pair said they were glad the rain held off

Mrs Caine said: 'Now two hearts beat as one. Our lives are just beginning after they both nearly came to an end.

'My husband died 10 years ago on Valentine's Day of a heart attack.

'I always said I would never get married again. I wasn't looking for anybody.'

The ceremony took place in front of friends and family at Mere Hall Register Office in Halliwell.

Mrs Caine said the couple's hearts now beat as one following the wedding

Mr Caine said the fact they had both had heart attacks spurred them on to marry sooner

Mrs Caine, who arrived at the venue in a white Bentley wedding car, wore a dress dotted with sparkling diamantes and topped the outfit with a tiara and a bouquet of white and purple flowers.

The mother of two, who works as a healthcare assistant in the delivery suite of the hospital where the couple met, said: 'It was a lovely ceremony. I'm feeling happy.'

Mr Caine hugged and kissed his new wife as they posed for photographs on the steps of Mere Hall, as guests clapped and cheered.

The happy couple are now looking forward to starting their life together as husband and wife

The father of three said: 'It was the best thing that ever happened to me, as daft as it sounds.

'I couldn't be happier. She never stops laughing. It's everything about her, she's just fantastic.

'It's like we've been together for years. We didn't see why we should wait.

'We've both had heart attacks, why wait 18 months, two years?'

The pair celebrated the marriage at Smiths Restaurant in Eccles and spent their first night together as man and wife at the luxury Hilton Hotel in Manchester.
