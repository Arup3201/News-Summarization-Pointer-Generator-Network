This is one man who never worries about leaving home in a rush and forgetting something.

Because wherever Liu Lingchao goes, his whole house goes with him.

Travelling salesman Mr Liu, who hoists his bamboo shed onto his back when he sets out to work in southern China, said his portable home makes him 'feel free'.

According

'I can move 
anywhere I want to go. It's an easy decision. It saves me a lot of money
on the journey,' he said.

'I feel free, I can go wherever I want to 
go, and I live on my own,' he added.

Made from bamboo poles, plastic film and sheets, the structure weighs around 60kg.
