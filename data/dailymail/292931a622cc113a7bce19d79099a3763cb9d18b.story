Hunter Biden, the younger of Vice President Joe Biden's two sons, is joining the board of directors of Ukraine's largest private natural gas producer, a firm controlled by a former natural resources minister to Viktor Yanukovych, the nation's recently toppled leader.

Russian sources are lashing out at the news, with anti-globalization and anti-American commentators throwing rhetorical bombs in Washington's direction and saying the move smacks of American 'colonialism' in the ex-Soviet state.

'For the United States it is in principle quite traditional for the relatives of state leaders to be involved in private business in regions where the American state is rather active,' said Timofey Bordachev, director of the Higher School of Economics Centre for European Studies in Moscow.

'Historically, this practice was widespread in the Latin America region, which was linked to the United States by a semi-colonial relationship,' he told MailOnline. 'We can now see them trying to extend the same practice to Ukraine.'

On Thursday the state-owned news agency RIA Novosti headlined an editorial: 'US Gets Hands on Ukrainian State Resources Through Hunter Biden's New Job.' The outlet claimed Washington had taken 'another step to grip Ukraine's state resources.

The editorial featured an interview with far-left American commentator Stephen Lendman, who called the move 'one of numerous examples of America's dark side.'

Awkward: Hunter Biden (R) is joining Ukraine's largest privately held gas company, and will serve a firm controlled by a former cabinet minister to the deposed president Viktor Yanukovych

'Washington wages all its wars for 
unchallenged dominance,' Lendman said. 'It wants state enterprises sold 
to Western corporations at fire sale prices. It wants control over state
 resources. Permanent war is official US policy and America's empire of 
bases reflects its belligerency. Its agenda is self-destructive and can't be sustained.'

'It's
 too late for mere scattered reforms,' he added. 'Unwilling to change, 
America is plagued by the same dynamic that doomed past empires.'

Eyebrows have been raised across Washington, D.C. since the Moscow Times first broke the news late Tuesday.
 When he visited Ukraine in April, the U.S. vice president was 
supportive of pro-Western demonstrators who deposed the Russia-backed 
Yanukovych in February.

He stressed in Kiev that Ukraine must 'fight the cancer of corruption that is endemic in your system right now.'

The country's May 25 election put a Western-backed president in power, but any resulting stability has been short-lived as it brought a backlash from supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the country's eastern regions.

Ukraine now teeters on the edge of civil war as Putin has pressed his advantage and scooped up territory, and pro-Russian insurgency forces seek independence for eastern regions and 
refuse to accept the election's legitimacy.

The 44-year-old Biden 
is joining Burisma Holdings at a time when the U.S. and western European
 nations are making a concerted effort to help Ukraine assert its energy
 independence from Moscow.

But Andrey Suzdaltsev, deputy dean of the 
Higher School of Economics Faculty of World Economics and Politics, 
told MailOnline that 'it is clear that this has nothing to do with investment' in the company.

'Most
 likely it has been done at the Ukrainian side's request,' he said. 'It is a kind 
of image thing: Ukraine has just received the first tranche of a loan 
from the IMF and it of course wants to demonstrate that people from the 
American elite will now come into Ukrainian companies and they will be 
followed by investment and new technology.'

'It is the kind of element of support in that does not cost the Americans anything,' Suzdaltsev explained.

In addition to sabers, the Kremlin has rattled chains in recent weeks, emphasizing that Ukraine owes it billions and threatening to cut off gas supplies, largely as a response to the former Soviet republic's stepwise moves toward the European Union.

The Cyprus-registered Burisma said that the younger Biden will head its legal unit and use his platform as chairman of World Food Program USA to seek international support for the company.

'I believe that my assistance in consulting the company on matters of transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion and other priorities will contribute to the economy and benefit the people of Ukraine,' Hunter Biden said in a statement released on the company's website.

Viktor Yanukovych (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) have been mutually supportive for years, leading the fallen Ukrainian leader to seek refuge in Moscow this year after pro-Western demonstrators forced him out of office

The company will likely see increased profits in the coming year as it sells to a domestic marketplace accustomed to seeing steep discounts on Russian-supplied gas. Now that Putin has taken an adversarial stance toward Kiev, those markdowns are gone – raising prices nationwide and opening up a path for Burisma to increase its margins.

Burisma also announced to weeks ago 
that Devon Archer, a college roommate of Secretary of State John Kerry's
 stepson, who is heir to the Heinz ketchup fortune, had joined its board
 to help attract U.S. investors.

The company's new power brokers, according to speculation from Yahoo News,
 might be its leverage against Russian intervention: Most of its 
holdings are in eastern Ukraine's Dnieper-Donets Basin, a region that's 
nearer to Russia than most of the country and a prime long-term target 
for a future Putin advance.

During his daily press briefing on 
Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney punted questions to 
the vice president's office.

'Hunter Biden and other members of the family are obviously private 
citizens,' Carney offered, 'and where they work is not an endorsement by
 the president or vice president.'

State
 Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki similarly brushed off a question about
 whether there were concerns about the Biden appointment, saying, 'No, 
there are not.'

Kendra 
Barkoff, a spokeswoman for Vice President Biden, said in a statement 
that his son 'is a private citizen and a lawyer. The vice president does
 not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this 
company.'

The Wall Street Journal reported
 Wednesday that Burisma is controlled by Nikolai Zlochevsky, a former 
member of Parliament in Viktor Yanukovych's 'Party of Regions' who first
 served as minister of environmental protection, and then as minister of
 ecology and natural resources – later losing that post and becoming 
deputy secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council 
until the Yanukovych government collapsed.

Ukrainian press reports describe a pattern in which Zlochevsky used his positions to approve a large number of oil and gas drilling permits – a sort of financial insurance policy against the kind of regime change that came a few years later.

Yanukovych fled Kiev after he was removed
 from power and an arrest warrant was issued, accusing him of the 
mass-murder of opposition protesters. President Barack Obama added him 
to America's international sanctions list in March, blocking him from 
entry into the U.S. and authorizing the freezing of his assets.

Melanie Sloan, executive director of the left-leaning ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told Reuters that the Biden appointment in Ukraine shouldn't be seen as a conflict of interest, regardless of how it dovetails with U.S. policy.

'It can't be that because your dad is the vice president, you can't do anything,' Sloan told Reuters.

But Russian observers were less understanding.

Boris Kagarlitskiy, director of the Institute of Globalisation and Social Movements in Moscow, called Hunter Biden's hiring part of 'the practice of so-called revolving doors that is widespread in America – when big companies and politicians lobbying for their interests establish links at the level of kinship relationships in one way or another.'

'This practice is now also being extended to Ukraine,' he told MailOnline.

Professor Maksim Braterskiy of the Higher School of Economics and National Research University, said that 'at this kind of level business and politics are inseparable: Being the son of the U.S. vice president, it is much easier to talk to other serious businessmen and open the requisite doors. This always has been and always will be the case.'

A Russian gas industry source added: 'The arrival of the son of U.S. Vice President to the Board of Directors of the company developing Ukrainian subsoil, shows the apparent interest American oligarchs to energy of Ukraine, which is directly related to U.S. foreign policy interests.'
