These images show the enormous scale of the world's biggest saw - capable of mining more than 4,500 tons of coal per hour.

Weighing in at 45,000 tons, the monster saw can slice its way through virtually anything, including huge mountains made entirely of coal.

The colossal piece of machinery, known as a bucket wheel excavator, is so big it takes 27 miners just to operate it at any one time.

Colossal: The world's biggest saw can be found at the world's biggest coal excavation site - the Bogatyr Mine near the city of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan

Moving mountains: The huge piece of machinery, which weighs 45,000 tons, is known in the industry as a bucket wheel excavator

At the coal face: The enormous bucket wheel excavator (pictured) is capable of mining more than 4,500 tons of material per hour

All weather performance: Despite its effectiveness at mining, the bucket wheel excavator's hulking mass means it can only travel one mile every three hours

The huge contraption can be found at the world's biggest single coal excavation site, the Bogatyr Mine near the city of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan.

Incredibly, the diameter of the saw alone spans nearly 12 metres - about the same height as a four- storey building - while a single machine can cost up to £66million to produce.

Its hulking mass and height of 45 metres means it can only travel one mile every three hours.

Russian photographer, Alexander Popov, 34, captured images of the contraption whilst on an assignment to take pictures of the Kazakhstan mining industry

The device uses a large rotating wheel mounted on a boom. Its outer edge is a series of scoops or buckets which remove coal dumps it on a conveyor belt

Weight: 45,000 tons

Mining speed: 4,500 tons an hour

Operators: 27 

Assembly cost: £66million

Saw diameter: 12 metres

Height: 45 metres 

Traveling Speed: One mile every three hours

But once it has reached its destination, it is capable of scooping out 4,500 tons of coal per hour. 

The contraption, which is rarely photographed, uses a large rotating wheel mounted on a boom. 

Its outer edge is a series of scoops or buckets which remove coal dumps it on a conveyor belt.

Russian photographer, Alexander Popov, 34, captured images of the contraption whilst on an assignment to take pictures of the Kazakhstan mining industry.

Mr Popov said: 'I have never seen a machine as big as this one although I have seen many powerful machines in the past.

'I got to see the saw as part of photography assignment for the Kazakhstan mining industry. I couldn't believe its size when I got up close.

'It is used in the mining of coal and can actually mine 4,500 tons of coal per hour, it really is an extraordinary piece of equipment.

Mr Popov  was granted a rare opportunity to picture the giant saw and said he was left in 'awe of its power and design'

'I was not scared to get so close but was more in awe of its power and design.'

About 40 million tons of coal is taken from the Bogatyr mines every year, accounting for 40 per cent of the nation's coal output.

In 1985 it entered the Guinness Book of Records for being the world's largest single coal mine when 56.8 million tonnes of coal were taken from the ground.
