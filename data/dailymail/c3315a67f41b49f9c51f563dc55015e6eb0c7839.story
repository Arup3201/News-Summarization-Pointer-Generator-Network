Ellie with Stacey the orphaned wombat

He's a tiny, bright-eyed bundle of grey fluff enveloped in fleecy blankets, clutching a battered soft toy in place of his mother.

Meet Danny the koala – the youngest and most vulnerable orphan at Cape Otway Conservation Ecology Centre in southern Australia.

Countryfile presenter Ellie Harrison's breath is quite taken away as she settles little Danny in her arms. His tiny face looks into hers and then towards the camera.

You can almost see him smile. He is, quite simply, one of the cutest animals ever to grace a television screen. 'Danny's so loveable because he's just like a baby teddy bear,' says Ellie. 'He's so tiny. He's just sublime. Everyone is going to fall in love with koalas once they've seen him.'

The 36-year-old flew Down Under to film the two-part Nature's Miracle Orphans, in which she meets animals who've lost their mothers in traffic accidents, dog attacks and other tragedies.

The charismatic cast includes koalas, wallabies, kangaroos and wombats, as well as anteaters and sloths in Costa Rica, visited by Ellie's co-host Max Hug Williams. The other stars are the human foster mums dedicated to saving the animals and reintroducing them to the wild – and cuddling is vital to survival.

With marsupials such as kangaroos, the babies, called joeys, spend their first six to nine months in their mother's pouch feeding and growing, which forges an incredibly deep bond.

The orphaned joeys' need for contact is so great that carers must provide it simply to keep them alive. 'Wallabies and kangaroos are known as heart-breakers to the staff because they're very difficult to keep alive,' Ellie explains. 'The stress of being separated from their mothers takes a huge toll on their physiology.'

Stella Reid of Wildhaven Wildlife Shelter, near Melbourne, has a cot in her bedroom for her youngest charges. Its current occupant is Neil the swamp wallaby – five weeks old when his mum was hit by a car. He survived, cushioned by her body, and was plucked from her pouch.

When he cries at night, Stella holds Neil in his cloth pouch so he can hear the sound of her heart, as he would have done in his mother's pouch. When he's stronger, he'll be paired with other wallabies to get used to life in a group.

Stella tips Neil out of his pouch occasionally – like his mother would have – so he learns to stand on his own two feet. Eventually, he'll bounce along at up to 30mph but right now, staying upright is tricky enough.

The wobbly wallaby leans on Ellie's hand, but still inadvertently reenacts Bambi on ice. 'It was surreal, charming and highly amusing,' Ellie says. 'It was like a human baby learning to walk: that trust, the need to hold on and the tentative nature of those first steps. They tire quickly and fall over. It's wonderful to see. You'd have to be on a stakeout for months in the wild to see that.'

Like Neil, Danny the koala was found by the road. Terribly weak, he ran up the leg of the motorist who stopped to rescue him. He's bottle-fed every two hours and will be looked after for at least a year – first indoors, then in an enclosure where he'll learn to climb trees. After that, the bush beckons.

Charming as he is, Danny isn't the orphan who touched Ellie's heart most, though. 'That was probably Stacey the wombat,' the presenter admits.

'She had a great character. Wombats do. They're known as the bulldozers of the bush and are quite confident. Stacey charged about the house head-butting and knocking things over. She had to be taken for walks in the garden to get her used to the outside. She follows sound, so you'd walk away and stamp your feet and she'd come charging after you, bound into your legs and start investigating.'

What surprised Ellie most, though, was the extent to which the carers were prepared to sacrifice their lives. 'They've dedicated their lives to caring for these orphans,' she says.

'They'll be woken through the night and don't get paid. All this care goes into one animal, and then they have to send it out into the wild not knowing how it's going to cope. But you know the likelihood of them surviving otherwise would've been virtually zero.'
