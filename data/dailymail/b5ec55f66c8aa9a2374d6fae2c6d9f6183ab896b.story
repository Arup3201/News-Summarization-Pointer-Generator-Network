Mario Mandzukic missed two golden chances as La Liga champions Atletico Madrid started the defence of their campaign with a whimper against Rayo Vallecano.

Missing suspended manager Diego Simeone, Atletico Madrid looked toothless without Diego Costa, even against the leakiest defence in last season’s competition, and the Croatian could not step up to fill the gap.

At a rowdy, intimate Vallecas, the favourites looked tired after their Super Cup exertions on Friday against Real Madrid and lacked incision, showing why they have been linked with playmakers like Santi Cazorla, Marco Reus and Shinji Kagawa this summer.

Despite winning the title, Atletico Madrid still contrived to end last season—an incredible, unforgettable one for Rojiblanco supporters—in disappointment. 

The Champions League final defeat by arch-rivals Real Madrid was so ‘Atletico’ in its nature it was almost fitting—so, so close, but yet so far. A constant theme throughout the club’s history.

Asked whether the club would be giving up their game-by-game stance to the season, which Simeone insisted the club were adhering to last year, the response was negative. He still sees his team as the underdogs to the league’s giants, Barcelona and Real Madrid, and wants them to take each task as it comes, forgetting about arcing grand-plans of lifting titles or competing in Europe.

Simeone was banned for this match, having been given five managerial yellow cards last season. 

Deadlock: Rayo Vallecano deserved their point as the reigning La Liga champions started their season slowly

We won’t be seeing him on the touchline for a while longer, after he was hit with an additional eight-game punishment for his unruly behaviour against Real Madrid in the Super Cup last week.

But the team have been well drilled by the Argentine and stuck to their roles under the watchful eye of the hulking Mono Burgos. If officials thought they had got out of the frying pan, they are firmly in the fire now, because the assistant coach has a capacity to go berserk that is even easier to trigger than Simeone’s.

Atletico have been somewhat deconstructed over the summer, with Chelsea recalling Thibaut Courtois and signing Filipe Luis and Costa. David Villa was another who left, leaving the club working hard to plug the holes. On paper, the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Mandzukic should be able to make a decent fist of the challenge, but they struggled against Rayo Vallecano.

Having seen Barcelona and Real win their opening matches, the task for Atletico against Madrid rivals Rayo was clear. Last season Simeone’s side won the title with 90 points. Given the millions the ‘big two’ have spent on reinforcements, the total could be closer to 100 this time around.

The spirit and resilience from last season was still evident, with captain Gabi taking an almost ludicrously high boot from Alberto Bueno to his face in the opening few minutes and Miranda and Diego Godin taking no nonsense at the back.

Tough night: Atletico Madrid were far from the form that saw them beat Real Madrid to the Spanish Super Cup

Chances were at a premium at the start of the match, with Griezmann being denied by Cristian Alvarez when the goalkeeper was quick off his line to intercept a through-ball. At the other end Chelsea’s on-loan youngster Gael Kakuta was finding getting the better of right-back Juanfran to be hard work, just like his parent side did last season in the Champions League.

In the 25th minute Atletico put together a brilliant move, with Griezmann flicking the ball into the path of Cristian Ansaldi, galloping up the field from left-back. His low ball was met at the far post by Mandzukic, but the former Bayern Munich man could only find the side-netting.

He had another brilliant opportunity moments later when Rayo centre-back Abdoulaye Ba needlessly gave the ball away on the edge of his own box. Raul Jimenez played it into the path of Mandzukic but the forward’s low strike was well saved by Cristian Alvarez.

On the occasions Rayo got forward, Atletico defended in numbers to keep them at bay, with Courtois’ replacement Miguel Angel Moya being well shielded by his backline, leaving him without a save to make in the first half.

Toothless: Without manager Diego Simeone on the touchline, Atletico lacked their usual spirit and desire

With Atletico struggling to win the midfield battle they took off Raul Jimenez and brought on youngster Saul Niguez, who spent last season on loan maturing under Paco Jemez at Rayo. It did nothing to help, with Rayo beginning to dominate the game.

Kakuta began to have more of an influence and former Manchester United forward Manucho forced a good save from Moya with a firm header after the electric Javier Aquino whipped it in from the right. Although the striker was an abject failure at Old Trafford, he caused Atletico more than a few problems after entering the fray as a substitute.

By the end of the game it was the home side that looked far likelier to break the deadlock and Atletico will consider themselves lucky to have escaped with a point. 

With Simeone unable to conduct affairs from the sidelines and instead stuck up near the press box, the players would not have been looking forward to their intense manager finally getting to let off some steam on the short coach-ride home.
