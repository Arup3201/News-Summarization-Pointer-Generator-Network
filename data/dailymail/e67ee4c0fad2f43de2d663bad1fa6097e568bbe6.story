Chris Christie, the charismatic and hard-charging Republican who has seen partisan pressure ratcheted up as he contemplates a run for the presidency, ignored his swirling abuse-of-power scandals Tuesday as he began his second term as New Jersey's governor.

He spoke only generally of a governing philosophy prefers substantive discussion to the hardscrabble slap-fests that make up much of Garden State politics.

'We cannot fall victim to the attitude of Washington, D.C.,' he said, 'the attitude that says, "I am always right and you are always wrong," the attitude that puts everyone into a box that they are not permitted to leave, the attitude that puts political victories ahead of policy agreements.'

He also referred to his obligation as governor to deal head-on with controversy, speaking of 'solemn obligations to make the hard decisions, to raise the uncomfortable topics, to require responsibility and accountability, to be willing to stand hard when principles are being violated and to be willing to compromise to find common ground with all of our people.'

Christie begins his second term amid controversy surrounding George Washington Bridge traffic and Hurricane Sandy relief distribution

Morning for the Christies began with a church service in Newark before the governor was sworn in for a second term on Tuesday

Christie's commitment to that level of accountability has been challenged in recent weeks. His administration was rocked with allegations that top officials arranged for new traffic patterns on the iconic George Washington Bridge as a form of political payback against the Democratic mayor of a nearby town.

That gridlock was brought to mind Tuesday as winter storms brought some traffic to a standstill and made many roads too treacherous to travel, causing Christie's team to cancel a planned post-inaugural party on Ellis Island.

The irony of traffic concerns becoming great enough to inconvenience Christie loyalists while his office is under investigation for allegedly causing days of traffic chaos wasn't lost on most observers.

In addition to the 'Bridgegate' scandal, Christie's lieutenant governor Kim Guadagno stands accused of threatening to withholding Hurricane Sandy reconstruction money from the mayor of Hoboken unless a commercial development that Christie favored was given a green light.

Guadagno has forcefully denied the charges.

She also received unwelcome attention on Monday when nine-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis accused her of ending his political aspirations in 2011 when she was the state's attorney general, striking him from a local ballot because he wanted to unseat a longtime Christie ally from the state Senate.

Christie's day started with a service at Newark's New Hope Baptist Church before a swearing in and address in Trenton.

Christie ignored his own parade of scandals during his inaugural address as legislators and dignitaries watched. Vincent Prieto (first row, 5th from L), the new General Assembly Speaker, is expected to have his knives sharpened for Christie as investigations proceed

But
 organizers already canceled the evening party on Ellis Island, a 
symbolic spot synonymous with the promise of the United States, because snow promised to make travel dangerous.

The island where some 12 million immigrants first entered the U.S. is divided between New Jersey and New York, but his party was supposed to be held in a hall on the New York side.

Food prepared for the party will instead be donated to food pantries in the Jersey City area.

Money collected for the $500 tickets to the inaugural celebration, and other contributions, will be used to help support three charities: Save Ellis Island, The New Hope Baptist Church and New Jersey Heroes, which was founded by first lady Mary Pat Christie.

Christie won re-election in November by a 22-point margin over state Sen. Barbara Buono, a Democrat.

The Republican governor built a national following as a blunt-talking and often funny politician who strove to show that he could find common ground with Democrats on some key issues, including overhauling the state's public-worker pension program and making it easier to fire underperforming teachers.

Christie became a fixture in speculation about who would seek the 2016 presidential nomination with his leadership after Superstorm Sandy slammed into his state in October 2012.

He worked with President Barack Obama and took on Republican members of Congress who were reluctant to approve record levels of aid for storm victims, receiving high marks from his constituents and plentiful national attention.

But his reputation has been battered since revelations this month that an appointee and a close aide appear to have ordered two of three approach lanes to the George Washington Bridge from the town of Fort Lee shut down for four days in September.

The move was allegedly political retribution against Mayor Mark Sokolich for not endorsing Christie for re-election.

The U.S. attorney's office and two state legislative committees are now investigating.

In the spotlight: Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno (pictured with Christie today) has been blamed in the latest scandal, but she denies ever having threatened to withhold Hurricane Sandy relief funds

Carl Lewis, the legendary Olympic sprinter and long-jumper and native New Jerseyan, has put Lt. Gov. Guadagno in the hot seat with claims that she ordered his name off an election ballot in 2011 in order to protect a sitting state Senator who was close to Gov. Christie

Christie has apologized, denied any involvement with or knowledge of the plot and fired a deputy chief of staff at the center of the controversy. But questions have continued.

Christie's administration also faces an allegation from the Democratic mayor of Hoboken that it tied the delivery of Superstorm Sandy aid to the low-lying city of 50,000 across from Manhattan to support for a prime real estate project.

Mayor Dawn Zimmer said she was told by Guadagno that the ultimatum came directly from Christie. Guadagno strongly denied those claims Monday and described them as 'false' and 'illogical.'

'Any suggestion that Sandy funds were tied to the approval of any project in New Jersey is completely false,' Ms Guadagno said.

In his re-election campaign, Christie did not make big new promises but said he would continue to work on recovery from Sandy, seek tax cuts and push for other previous priorities with which the Democrat-controlled Legislature has not been willing to go along.

Christie has not ruled out a 2016 presidential run and has taken a more visible role on the national stage after accepting the position as the head of the Republican Governors Association.

He spent this weekend down in Florida, and was feted by billionaire Republican donor and Home Depot co-founder Kenneth Langone who held a fundraiser in Christie’s honor.
