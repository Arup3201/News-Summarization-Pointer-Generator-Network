Ten Roman Catholic priests in Spain have been charged with sexually abusing altar boys after the Pope was contacted by an alleged victim.

The priests, as well as two Catholic lay workers, are suspected of abusing four teenage boys between 2004 and 2007- with the most serious offences taking place in a house used by the clerics.

The alleged abuse came to light after one of the victims, now 24, wrote to the Pope to say he had been molested when he was an altar boy.

Pope Francis has personally telephoned the man  to offer his apologies, Spanish news site Religion Digital reported. The head of the Catholic Church then ordered an investigation.

Several arrests were made in November but the suspects are now free on bail. If convicted they could each be facing more than 20 years of jail time.

The Archbishop of Granada, Francisco Javier Martinez, and fellow priests prostrated themselves in front of the altar of Granada's cathedral to seek pardon for sexual abuse in the Church at the time of the arrests.

The Archbishop also removed several priests linked to the case from their duties.

The victim who appealed for help to the Pope claimed the abuse started when he was 14 and continued up to the age of 17.

It is alleged that the boy and a friend, who had served as altar boys in the Diocese of Granada, were invited by a priest to spend time at his parochial house and another property in a suburb of Granada,  where the most serious assaults were committed.

Abuse survivors have criticised the Church which they claim has failed to punish senior officials accused of covering up scandals in several countries over many years.

Pope Francis has promised a policy of zero tolerance for sexual abuse of children by clerics and last year asked for forgiveness for the Church from victims.

The Vatican said last year it had defrocked about 850 priests between 2004 and 2013 who had been accused of sexually abusing minors.
