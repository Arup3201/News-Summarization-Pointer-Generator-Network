England are braced for an aerial bombardment directed by Ireland's Test Lions half-backs when the RBS Six Nations title rivals lock horns at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday.

The Red Rose back three of Alex Goode, Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell face a busy afternoon patrolling the wide open spaces of Lansdowne Road to counter the pinpoint kicking of Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton.

It promises to be a key battleground in the seismic showdown between the Six Nations' only unbeaten teams, with the winners placing themselves on the home straight towards a precious Grand Slam.

Conor Murray is also a threat to England with his kicking game, according to Mike Catt

'Conor Murray and Sexton are the in-form nine and 10 in the world at the moment. They control the game exceptionally well,' attacking skills coach Mike Catt said.

'From that point of view their aerial route with Tommy Bowe, Simon Zebo and Rob Kearney is very formidable.

'They have a very good kicking game. We have to match them and try and get the better of them in certain aspects of our game.

'It will be a hugely exciting Test match, two positive sides playing some exciting rugby. It should be a great spectacle.

'Ireland have a really good balance to their game and have some dangerous and smart players.'
