Every bride dreams of the perfect wedding, but Nancy Sanchez was happy to forget the bouquet, bridesmaids and room full of guests for her big day.

For the 18-year-old's new husband Anthony Carrion is on remand in San Bruno jail in San Francisco, awaiting trial for attempted murder, two robberies, attempting carjacking and kidnapping.

Like other inmates who marry behind bars, they said their vows over the phone, separated by bulletproof glass and won't be alone until his trial date is set - but the teenager says she knows Anthony's 'the one'.

Nancy has no aisle on her special day, instead going through the San Bruno jail's metal detectors 

The pair are married through the bullet proof glass in the jail visitor centre, saying their vows down the phones, with only Nancy's best friend and the prison chaplain present 

The couple are just two of the estimated 1,800 pairs who get married behind bars each year in California alone.

Her story is featured in a Channel 4 programme, Married Behind Bars, airing Thursday night. 

Nancy drove herself to the jail with her best friend as sole wedding guest. Once they made it through security, she and Anthony - wearing a government-issue orange jumpsuit - were married by the prison chaplain, Pastor Nation.

The ceremony lasted just 10 minutes and was conducted over the phone, the newlyweds separated by bulletproof glass.

No rings were exchanged.  

She said: 'I'm just 18 and a lot of people are like "oh you're getting married so young", and I'm just like yes, so?'

Gang member Anthony, who is awaiting trial for attempted murder, smiles as he says his vows 

Anthony, who does not yet have a date for his trial, has told Nancy that if found guilty he will likely spend six years in prison. However he knows if convicted he will be probably be sentenced to 29-year to life. 

The pair met while in  school together, where Nancy had a crush on Anthony, who was two years above her. 

Like many of the males in Nancy's neighbourhood, Anthony joined a gang as a teenager, getting the gang symbol of four dots tattooed on his face under his left eye and on his hand.

Further stress is placed on their relationship by the face that Anthony and Nancy's family are from two rival gangs.

She explained: 'I've had a crush on Anthony ever since middle school. He was in a different crew and I would never see him in school because he would always skip.

'We never went out. He had his girlfriend and I was with my boyfriend five years. But then my boyfriend broke my heart.' 

Nancy stayed with her uncle's family in Chicago to get over the break-up, but she always maintained feeling for Anthony.

It was after she returned to San Francisco and was visiting a friend in San Bruno jail that Nancy spotted Anthony in the visitors' room and they began talking again by phone.

Then three weeks later  Anthony proposed.

Despite being just 18, and having become engaged after only dating three weeks, Nancy is confident of their relationship and beams throughout the 10 minute ceremony 

Nancy, who does not live with her own family, had no relatives present during her wedding. 

Anthony, who is facing multiple charges including attempted murder and kidnapping, has promised Nancy that he will leave the gang when he is released.

Despite their unconventional relationship, Nancy is confident in their love.

She said: 'He's cute and goofy. He always makes me laugh on our visits, even though it's through a window. I don't have any second thoughts I know he is the one.'

Pastor Nation, who has married over 500 couples behind bars, thinks it can help rehabilitate some prisoners.

He said: 'They don't have to be hard with their girl. You see two people in one individual. You see him on the block and he's a little rough and then you see him around his girl and he's just a humble nice guy.'

Married Behind Bars airs at 10pm Thursday, 5 February, on Channel 4.
