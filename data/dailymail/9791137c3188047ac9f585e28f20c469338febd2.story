An Atlanta mother of eight barely avoided being homeless thanks to a good Samaritan who took her family in after she says she was kicked out of a home she rented from a person who didn't actually own the property.

Lyna McNeil said she agreed to $750-per-month rent from a man who identified himself as 'Shawn' after she saw his phone number on a neighborhood sign.

But this month a man named 'Mr. Carr.' showed up at the house claiming he was the home's true owner and demanding she and her family immediately leave.

'I have offered to pay him rent. I've offered to pay him security deposits, but he doesn't want that,' McNeil told WSB.

Not only was McNeil forced to spend the night in her car keeping watch over her possessions on the lawn of the property to be sure no one stole them, she had to comfort her children as Animal Control came to take the family's dogs away as they no longer had any place to keep them.

'The children are 
crying because they’re taking our dogs,' she said.

Carr, confronted by reporters in his car, refused to respond to interview requests.

The famiily's dogs were even taken by Animal Control as they had no shelter for them

He had filed an intruder affidavit with the Superior Court of Fulton Count and Fulton County Sheriff's department dispatched officers to 'keep the peace' as the order was executed.

The Sheriff's department said they could not further comment on the issue.

As soon as the family was out, Carr had the locks changed.

Neighbors called the McNeil's a 'polite' family who we easy to live next to.

'I just don’t understand how somebody could rent a place that’s not theirs,' said one neighbor, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Shortly after their story aired, a generous soul offered the family a home rent-free for at least a few months

One neighbor said that besides the McNeils, the house had stood empty for as long as they could remember as they  could not recall ever seeing a for-sale sign at the property.

Thankfully for the family, shortly after local news aired their story an unidentified Samaritan came forward offering a vacant four-bedroom home for the family to stay in for at least a couple of months rent-free.

'Thank you so, so much. And God bless you so, so much,' McNeil told the generous soul on the phone as she was informed.
