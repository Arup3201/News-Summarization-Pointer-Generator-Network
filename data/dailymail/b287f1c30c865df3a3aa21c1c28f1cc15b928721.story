The Buglife charity said the bumblebee is having a difficult year due to the wet weather

Insects are struggling with the UK's wet and cold summer, and are now at very low numbers, according to a wildlife charity.

The Buglife conservation charity says that bees, wasps, moths and butterflies have all seen their populations drop in 2012 - and rare species may be at risk of extinction due to the elements.

Bees and wasps have struggled to find enough nectar and aphids to feed on, while charity volunteers are reporting less sightings of moths and butterflies.

Insects are vulnerable to weather 
changes, and this year has seen some of the heaviest rainfall ever - 
with April and June the wettest quarter ever reported.

Chief executive Matt Shardlow told the BBC: 'They might not recover and could be driven closer to extinction.'

Shardlow said damp conditions have reduced the number of aphids for wasps to feed on, and 250 species of bees were struggling without the high temperatures need to ensure a good supply of nectar and pollen.

He said: 'We are seeing very low numbers of them now, as well as small bumble bees, which is a sign they haven't had enough nectar and pollen to feed on.'

However it is not all bad news in the insect world, with creatures that thrive in damp conditions doing well over the wet months.

Wasps feed on aphids, which are also in decline due to the weather, which leads to a knock-on effect in the food chain

It's not all bad news: Glow-worms are having a strong year, thanks to the proliferation of slugs and snails

Shardlow said drone flies and mosquitoes, and snails and slugs, have seen population booms.

He said: 'This means that anything which feeds on slugs and snails will also benefit this year.

'We've had reports of large numbers of glow worms, for example, which feed on slugs and snails.'

But volunteer counters are reporting a drop in moth and butterfly populations.
