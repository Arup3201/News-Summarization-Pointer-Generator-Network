A mix of Cristiano Ronaldo-inspired confidence and utmost respect for an opponent that has won five European Cups summed up the mood in Madrid as Carlo Ancelotti’s team left the Spanish capital for Liverpool on Tuesday morning.

Most Real Madrid supporters are aware that Liverpool are not the attacking force they were last season without the injured Daniel Sturridge and the departed Luis Suarez.

But Liverpool's European Cup haul means they have always been revered at the home of the ten-times trophy winners and ever since the days of Rafa Benitez’s Spanish Liverpool there has also be no shortage of affection towards them.

Ronaldo lost only one game at Anfield during his time with United, but never scored

Madrid’s Diario AS newspaper dedicated a page to an interview with Alan Kennedy, who scored the only goal of the game when Liverpool beat Madrid in the final in Paris in 1981.

And much was made elsewhere of the fact that Real also lost their other two encounters against Liverpool, 1-0 and 4-0 in 2009.

Kennedy is asked at length about Bob Paisley who Real Madrid manager Ancelotti equalled last season when he won the European Cup for the third time.

Aside from recalling the wit of his former manager – telling his full-back ‘they shot the wrong Kennedy in 1963’ after one of his poorer performances, Kennedy paid tribute to both men saying.

‘There is only one Paisley but I like Ancelotti. He’s very astute, he knows how to manage a dressing room and I have a lot of admiration for him.'

Any confidence Madrid have ahead of the tie is also tempered by the fact that not only have they never beaten Liverpool in European football they have also never scored against them.

Ronaldo is averaging more than two goals a game in La Liga at the moment and is certainly on the kind of form to change that but traditionally he has his own problems when he goes to Anfield.

Marca ran with the headline ‘The Anfield Curse’ on Monday and told readers that in five visits to Liverpool’s stadium Ronaldo had failed to score, registering only two goals against them at Old Trafford.

The dark statistics cloud did have a silver lining however – Mario Balotelli has faced Iker Casillas twice and failed to score against him. For all of Liverpool's history one thing is certain – Ronaldo and Balotelli are both in frightening form but in very different senses.
