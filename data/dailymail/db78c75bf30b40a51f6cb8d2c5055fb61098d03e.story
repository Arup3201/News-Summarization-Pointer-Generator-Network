A Washington state police detective is facing charges of sexual misconduct with a minor after she allegedly had sex with a 17-year-old she met while working as a resource officer at a high school. 

The relationship between Det. Dione Thompson and the transgender teen began in 2010, according to KiroTV, when the then-17-year-old was a student at Bothell High School and continued until February 2011. 

The 45-year-old reportedly had sexual encounters with the former student in her patrol car at a library and outside of a restaurant, Seattle PI reports. 

The teenager was living as a woman when Thomas first met him, but now identifies as a man. Dione allegedly even moved the teen into the home she shared with her girlfriend.

According to court documents, the relationship began with Thompson contacting the former student on Facebook and the two soon began seeing each other outside of school.

At the time, the former student identified as a female and court records state that Thompson persuaded him to live in the home Thompson shared with her partner at a time when he was facing 'a lot of turmoil' personally.

He reportedly lived with Thompson for a long period of time and the two continued the sexual relationship, according to KOMO news.

The former student initially denied the relationship when suspicions surfaced shortly after the two got together, but reportedly contacted Thompson's ex-partner in August who reported the claims to a King's County Sheriff's Office detective.

Thompson, who is a 16-year veteran of the Bothell Police Department, was transferred out of the high school once she became a detective after serving at the school for six or seven years, Kiro reports.

She is currently on paid, administrative leave pending the investigation and denied having sex with the then teen when investigators contacted her regarding the allegations in September.

She has not been jailed, according to Seattle PI, but if convicted could face between six to 12 months of jail time. 

The victim told investigators that Thompson ended the relationship in 2011 but he only now realizes the harm Thompson caused by abusing her power and the trust he gave her.
