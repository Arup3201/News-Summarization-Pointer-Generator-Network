The birth of a  male gorilla has been welcomed by Sydney's Taronga Zoo, marking the beginning of a second generation of Western Lowland Gorillas.

Female gorilla Mbeli, who was born at Taronga Zoo in 2003, gave birth to the tiny newborn on Tuesday. The zoo has named him, Mjukuu - which translates to 'grandchild' or 'second generation' in the East African Swahili language.

Mbeli and her new infant have been photographed bonding, as she cradles and breast-feeds three-day-old Mjukuu.

Lou Grossfelt, Taronga Zoo's senior primate keeper said Mbeli grew up in a natural gorilla family group.

'She has seen first-hand how to care for an infant,' she said, 

Following Friday's exciting announcement, Rob Stokes, NSW environment minister, has commended the zoo's dedication to animal conservation.

'This is a wonderful achievement for Taronga's role in the international breeding program', he said. 'It certainly reflects the zoo's dedication and commitment to conservation.

'This birth is a triumph and testament to the hard work for the keepers.' 

The petite human-like infant is fathered by Taronga's new Silverback gorilla, Kibali, who arrived at the zoo in 2012 from France to follow retired Kibabu, an older Silverback gorilla.

After searching for the perfect gorilla to fill Kibabu's place, Kibali was found to have the ideal behaviour for Taronga Zoo. Mjukuu is Kibali's first born.

Cameron Kerr, director and chief executive at Taronga Zoo was overjoyed to announce the birth of Mjukuu, at a time when the gorilla population is reducing.

'This birth is vital for Taronga’s highly successful Western Lowland Gorilla breeding program,' Mr Kerr said. 'Taronga continues to tell many people about the plight of gorillas in the wild and what can be done just by visiting Taronga to see this infant.

'Taronga supports gorillas in the wild through the “They’re Calling On You” Project to recycle mobile phones to help reduce illegal mining in gorilla habitat and to fund extra wildlife rangers to protect gorillas and other wildlife in Africa.

'Researchers have also warned that the current Ebola outbreak could have devastating effects on gorilla populations. In 2003 and 2004, the virus reduced the number of gorillas in the Republic of Congo’s Pdzala Kokoua National Park from 380 to less than 40.

'This newborn is the latest contribution to Taronga’s story of hope for wildlife,' said Mr Kerr.
