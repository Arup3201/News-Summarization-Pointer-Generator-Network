Nothing seems too pretty in the wider situation around Rangers these days as discord and intrigue dominate.

Rarely, however, has winning ugly felt quite so satisfying for a club desperate to remind of its power on the pitch.

A first victory over Premiership opposition in two years was secured thanks to a deflected drive from youngster Lewis Macleod. It came late in a tie that was mostly a grim war of attrition, but those aesthetic merits mattered little to Ally McCoist and his players.

Three times in succession they had come up short in cup competitions when faced by opposition from the top division. Inverness delivered the first of those blows with a 3-0 cruise at Ibrox in October 2012, but last night brought a very different outcome.

Man of the Match: Lewis Macleod.

A trip to face Falkirk in the last 16 of the League Cup is Rangers’ reward, yet a psychological barrier may also have been breached. In trying to show they can still cut it against the country’s leading teams — as their wage budget suggests they should — this was a significant breakthrough.

One look around the stadium would confirm, however, that Ibrox is still a long way away from welcoming back the good old days. A crowd of just 15,208 was present, surely a reflection of the distrust that exists between supporters and the board. That is a situation only further aggravated by the mysterious case of Rafat Rizvi and the Malaysian delegation.

Yet Inverness could not capitalise on the lack of an intimidating atmosphere. In truth, John Hughes’ side were well short of the form that marked their impressive start to the season and took them to the Premiership summit.

The chance of a second successive final in this competition has vanished, with Hughes left to try to regroup after back-to-back defeats.

Given the pretty much universal opinion that Friday night’s 4-0 win over Raith Rovers in Kirkcaldy had been their most convincing 90 minutes of the season, it was little surprise that McCoist opted to field an identical starting line-up.

The desire to prove a point was significant for all at Ibrox but Inverness also had bountiful motivation after League Cup glory slipped away following their defeat on penalties to Aberdeen at Celtic Park in March.

Boss Hughes had attempted to influence the psychology of the tie by insisting Rangers should be viewed as favourites. They were also words to try to lessen the expectation on the shoulders of his squad, after an exemplary start to the Premiership campaign was halted by a 3-1 defeat at Partick Thistle.

Suspensions to Graeme Shinnie and Ross Draper forced alterations regardless of that result and were perhaps reflected in a distinctly fractured opening to the game.

The piecemeal pattern persisted for the bulk of the first half.

No one could argue about the level of commitment shown by either side, with relentless harrying of opponents taking place in every corner of the pitch. What was absent, however, was any composure in the positive aspects of play.

The best chance fell to Rangers and, perhaps predictably, to Kris Boyd. With 16 minutes gone, Liam Polworth gifted the ball to Nicky Clark and allowed him to feed his strike partner.

Boyd’s first touch took him clear of the Inverness centre-halves but a toe-poked effort was diverted wide by the left foot of Dean Brill. Ibrox groaned in frustration.

That emotion continued to loom large, with misplaced passes sent in every conceivable direction. Some of Ian Black’s long-range deliveries were a particular source of ire before he became the first booking for a foot up against Danny Williams. Aaron Doran promptly evened up the crime count by taking down Fraser Aird after the winger had evaded two team-mates.

Rangers looked marginally more threatening but could hardly be described as fluent. Their visitors had toiled to get arch-poacher Billy McKay involved, although they did fashion an opportunity when Greg Tansey skidded a low pass through for Marley Watkins.

He could, though, only hit a tame shot directly at Steve Simonsen after the back-tracking Bilel Mohsni applied sufficient pressure.

It was more in keeping with events that the half should close with another pair of cautions.

Referee Crawford Allan first pulled up Tansey for toppling Law before Macleod earned a yellow card for a rash lunge on Watkins.

A mistake looked the most likely route towards a breakthrough and one almost arrived 12 minutes after the restart via a player who is no stranger to a lapse. Mohsni either thought the referee had stopped play or simply had no idea Watkins was behind him when he attempted the most casual of turns on the edge of his area.

The Caley Thistle winger gladly accepted the gift and advanced to deliver a low cross that saw Darren McGregor squeeze out McKay at the far post. The Tunisian international owed a large debt of gratitude to his colleague.

Aird then wasted a promising position for Rangers when he had possession pinched from him by Carl Tremarco.

The general quality remained dismal but it took until the 73rd minute for changes to be made by both sides.

Jon Daly and David Tempelton replaced Boyd and Aird, while Williams made way for Ryan Christie.

Templeton promptly smashed a long-range off target before the decisive goal finally arrived after 78 minutes in suitably scrappy fashion.

Rangers hollered for a hand-ball as Nicky Law tried to nick his way beyond Tansey. The ball broke to Macleod and his low strike took a wicked deflection off Josh Meekings to beat Brill.

Inverness staged a desperate late push for a leveller, with Black forced to clear a Christie header off the line in the final minute.

There was still time for Gary Warren to have another header ruled out for offside before Ibrox had its long-awaited scalp.
