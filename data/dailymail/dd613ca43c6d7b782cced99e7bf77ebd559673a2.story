Firearms officer Carol Howard, 34, told a tribunal that she was singled out and spied on by a male colleague in the Met Police

A black firearms officer who was once
 Scotland Yard’s Olympics security poster girl claimed she was singled 
out and spied on by a bullying officer dubbed the 'little weasel', a tribunal heard today.

Carol
 Howard, 34, an elite Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) officer who helped guard London from terror attacks during the 2012 Games, claims she 
was picked on and treated unfairly by her supervisor, Acting Inspector Dave Kelly.

And she told a tribunal that the Metropolitan Police had not learned any lessons since the Macpherson inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry branded it 'institutionally racist'.

PC Carol Howard told the hearing today how Mr Kelly 'targeted her', and said: 'There has been a blatant cover-up by the Met. The police have not learned any lessons from the Macpherson Report, and they still continue to discriminate.'

Miss Howard, who is suing the Met for racial and sexual discrimination, said no other Authorised Firearms Officer (AFO) in the white, 
male-dominated Diplomatic Protection Group was subjected to the same 
scrutiny .

In
 her witness statement, Miss Howard, who has been an AFO since 2010, said she worked hard to become one of only two black, female AFOs in the DPG, but that her career was 'disrupted' when Mr
 Kelly was posted to DPG in around December 2011.

From then on, she told the tribunal in a statement, she was 'targeted, subjected to detrimental treatment, and harassed' by him.

'It
 was evident that the other sergeants found him annoying... he was 
often referred to as the "little weasel" by supervisors', she added.

Miss Howard first met the acting inspector when she was posted outside the American Embassy in London, and said she found him 'smarmy.'

'My
 first impression was that he seemed friendly, although unctuous,' she said in her statement.  'This 
is because our conversation felt forced and somewhat unnatural - I felt he came across a little smarmy.'

She said he invited her to take part in shooting practice in front of her male colleagues, and said: 'I was really upset that he was making me look incompetent amongst the guys, especially as I had worked hard not to stand out.'

The officer said that a colleague told her Mr Kelly had checked her Facebook account while she was off work sick after dropping a dumb-bell on her foot, and said to colleagues that she 
was 'taking the mickey'.

Miss Howard said: 'I
 was not aware of Kelly looking at anyone else’s Facebook while at work 
while that officer is on sick leave, and I believe that this is another 
example where I was treated less favourably than others.'

In November 2012, Miss Howard said she put in an official complaint after discovering that Mr Kelly had been spying on her while she was working outside the American Embassy using CCTV.

She said: 'Further
 to this, I received a hostile attack by Kelly where he pinned me in the 
corner and pointed his fingers in my face in a threatening manor while 
carrying his Glock pistol.

'I was very intimidated by this attack.'

Miss
 Howard subsequently lost her Fairness at Work complaint, which she 
described as a 'whitewash' and an 'attempt to sweep my claims under the 
carpet.'

She said there were 'significant delays' in the investigation, and a number of her complaints were not even looked at.

The firearms officer also told how she was picked to be in a photoshoot for a newspaper article about the London Olympics, and said she believed she was picked to represent diversity following the controversial police shooting of Mark Duggan in August 2011.

In
 her statement she said: 'I was prompted by the 
respondent’s press officer, Steve, on what to say in response to certain 
issues.

'The questions put to me concerned the public perception of firearm officers, and references were made to our bad reputation.

'In my opinion, it was based around Mark Duggan.  I
 felt I had been singled out and chosen to represent diversity and to 
change the public image of white police shooting black youth.'

The
 officer later found out that she had 
been singled out due to her colour, the tribunal heard, leaving her feeling 'betrayed' and 'used as a token'.

She also said that on one occasion, she was picked to drive Doreen Lawrence in what she believed was an attempt by her bosses to show Mrs Lawrence how far the Met had come since the inquiry into her son's death.

Officer: Miss Howard said Mr Kelly picked on her because of 'his attraction to me and my disinterest'

She said: 'I felt I had been called upon to demonstrate to Mrs
 Lawrence that the organisation had come a long way as here I stood as a
 successful black female officer.'

The tribunal heard how Miss Howard faced disciplinary proceedings for dishonesty after requesting emergency leave when her thought her car had been stolen.

In fact, her Mini Cooper had been towed away by a bailiff after she'd failed to pay a parking fine, and she was forced to pay £1,100 to get her Mini Cooper back.

The hearing was told that Mr Kelly referred her to the Directorate of Professional Standards reporting for dishonesty and integrity, although the charges against her were dropped.

Miss Howard, who is currently signed off sick with work-related stress, said: 'Throughout my policing career, I have worked hard and have had a good rapport with my policing colleagues.

Tribunal: Miss Howard said Mr Kelly picked on her because of 'his attraction towards me and my disinterest'

'When Acting Inspector Dave Kelly joined the team, I no longer enjoyed being at work and he made me question whether I want to be a police officer at all.

'He has robbed me of the chance to fulfill my aspirations of working as an AFO...  By doing nothing, the DPG have encouraged Kelly's ill-treatment and allowed it to continue. They chose to turn a blind eye and made excuses for his behaviour.

'The DPG have encouraged him to single me out, bully me, allow him to act in an aggressive manor towards me on one occasion when he was carrying his gun.'

She added: 'I believe the reasons for my malicious, unethical treatment at the hands of Kelly is a direct result of discrimination based on my race, sex and my looks, Kelly's attraction towards me and my disinterest.'

The Met Police has said it will 'robustly defend' itself against Miss Howard's claims.  The tribunal continues.
