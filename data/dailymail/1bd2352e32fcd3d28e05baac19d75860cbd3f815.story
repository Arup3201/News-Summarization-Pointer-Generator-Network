More than 800,000 households will spend over half of their income on debt repayments if interest rates rise as expected, research shows.

The effects of a rise in line with market predictions – to about 2 per cent by 2017 – could be disastrous for many.

And if rates increase beyond expectations to 4 per cent, the number of households with such perilous burdens could surge well past a million.

The report examines an ‘adverse but plausible scenario’ in which Britain has weak income growth in coming years, with the gains skewed in favour of richer households.

Mark Carney, the Bank of England’s new governor, has attempted to quash speculation that rates will rise after four years at 0.5 per cent.

Nevertheless the report by the Resolution
Foundation think-tank, published today, marks the first full analysis 
of how higher rates could affect different types of households.

It warns that many are heavily dependent on rates staying at their current rock-bottom level.

It argues that politicians must make the most of the low base rate to discuss how to tackle Britain’s debt burden, instead of storing up problems for the future.

Matthew Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation told The Times: ‘There is now the real prospect that a large number of households already burdened with debt could collapse under its weight if economic conditions tighten.

‘Even if interest rates stay in line with expectations, we are likely to see a rise in the number of families struggling with heavy levels of repayment over the coming years.

‘If the squeeze on household incomes continues, Britain could be left in a fragile position, with even moderate additional increases in interest rates leading to a major surge in families with dangerous debt levels – especially among worse-off households.’
