Footage has surfaced of a woman verbally and physically assaulting a media crew, moments after she was released from police custody for punching a security dog.

Tiffanny Maree Jager, 18, is seen storming towards a Channel 7 cameraman, punching his camera on to the pavement before confronting a photographer.

The media crews attempt to calm barefoot Jager down as she demands they 'get the f*****g cameras out my face,' shove the photographer and strike him on the head.

Jager was released moments earlier from Brisbane City Watch House, where she spent the night and was fined $500 for attacking a security dog on Sunday at Roma St station, reports News.com.

Jager, from Ipswich, west of Brisbane, Queensland, was asked to leave the station when she was found smoking on the platform at 9.50pm on Sunday night.

She racially abused the station manager, shoving her and saying 'f*** you, you Indian s***, before again being asked to leave the station.

Shortly afterwards, Jager returned, attacking a muzzled security dog, punching the animal repeatedly in the head and body.

Jager suffered minor injuries to her leg during the incident.

Magistrate John McGrath reportedly told her: 'You were very lucky that dog had a muzzle on because the wounds to your leg may very well have been far more serious.'

He also added that if Jager didn't change her conduct immediately she would find herself in 'a lot more strife.'

Jager pleaded guilty to public nuisance, smoking on a train platform and animal cruelty.

A spokesperson for Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia '(Police) is aware of the incident and is looking into the circumstances.'
