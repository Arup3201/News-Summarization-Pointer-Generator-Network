Concern: William Hague warned that Israel's plans to build 3,000 more settlements would cast doubt on their commitment to peace with the Palestinians

The Foreign Secretary William Hague today urged Israel to abandon plans to build 3,000 more settlement homes in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, warning that going ahead with the move would cast doubt on Israel's commitment to achieving peace with the Palestinians.  

The proposals to build the thousands of new homes were revealed yesterday, one day after the UN voted to recognise a Palestinian state.

Mr Hague warned that going ahead with the plans would make a two-state solution 'difficult to achieve'.

The Foreign Secretary said he was 'extremely concerned' at the plans and warned that they undermined Israel's international reputation.

Mr Hague abstained at the UN General Assembly vote over Palestine's status on Thursday after President Mahmoud Abbas failed to give assurances that he would return to peace negotiations without preconditions.

But Mr Hague also repeatedly made clear in calls with Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman that the UK would not support a strong reaction to the vote.

Speaking today, the Foreign Secretary said: 'I am extremely concerned by reports that the Israeli cabinet plans to approve the building of 3,000 new housing units in illegal settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

'Israeli settlements are illegal under international law and undermine trust between the parties. If implemented, these plans would alter the situation on the ground on a scale that makes the two-state solution, with Jerusalem as a shared capital, increasingly difficult to achieve.

'They would undermine Israel's 
international reputation and create doubts about its stated commitment 
to achieving peace with the Palestinians.

'The
 UK strongly advises the Israeli government to reverse this decision. 
The window for a two-state solution is closing, and we need urgent 
efforts by the parties and by the international community to achieve a 
return to negotiations, not actions which will make that harder.'

The Palestinians have refused to negotiate while Israeli settlement construction continues.

On
 Thursday the UN General Assembly agreed to recognise Palestine as a 
non-member observer state allowing the country to take part in UN 
debates and potentially join bodies such as the International Criminal 
Court.

The Palestinians are firmly opposed to the construction and say that the development will cut the West Bank in half, preventing the formation of a joining Palestinian state.

Some of the units have been reported to be built between Jerusalem and the Maale Adumim settlement, according to the Israeli Haaretz newspaper.

Israel is also said to be accelerating the processing of planning permission for another 1,000 such housing units.

Worthless: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the vote is meaningless

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu called the speech by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to 
the General Assembly shortly before the vote ‘defamatory and venomous,’ 
saying it was ‘full of mendacious propaganda’ against Israel.

Netanyahu called the vote meaningless.

Mark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, said earlier today that the UN vote was a ‘negative political theatre’ that would ‘hurt peace’.

But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said this was the 'last chance to save the two-state solution' with Israel.

Since the occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, some 500,000 Jews live in more than 100 settlements. The communities are considered illegal under international law but Israel challenges this.

Israel still controls the West Bank, east Jerusalem and access to Gaza, and it accused the Palestinians of bypassing negotiations with the campaign to upgrade their U.N. status.

Peace talks have been conducted between Israel and the Palestinian Authority intermittently over the last 20 years but with no permanent solution.

The most recent peace talks halted in January after several months of ‘proximity talks’ made no progress.
