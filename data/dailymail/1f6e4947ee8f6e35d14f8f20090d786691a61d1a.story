She may have shot to fame
 on Made In Chelsea as a self-proclaimed 'player' known for her 
hilariously cutting rejections and cold-hearted attitude but Lucy Watson
has won over the nation with her girl-next-door looks and loyalty to her friends - and it seems that brands are taking notice.

The 24-year-old has been snapped up by a number of high-profile fashion and beauty companies to front their campaigns. The latest? Showcasing her toned and smooth legs as the face of Wilkinson Sword.

The new advert, which was aired on E4 during Monday night's Made In Chelsea, shows Lucy chatting about her beauty regime ahead of a big night out.

New face (and legs!): Made In Chelsea star Lucy Watson has been unveiled as the new brand ambassador for Wilkinson Sword

The reality TV star can be seen rifling through her wardrobe as she says: 'When you're feeling glamorous and dressing up and making effort, it gives you more confidence.

'When you're getting ready with the girls, I'm normally the one helping my friends, there are shoes everywhere and dresses covering this entire floor.'

Speaking about her style, Lucy, who is making a name for herself as MIC's resident fashionista, added: 'I do like getting my legs out - it's one or the other, boobs or legs.'

Lucy, who has opened her heart and penned a dating guide, which she promises will be the modern girl’s no-holds-barred guide to 21st century dating, relationships and break-ups, added: 'The best nights happen when it's just the girls. You don't need boys to have fun.'

No wonder they snapped her up! Lucy shows off her toned and smooth legs in the new campaign film, which was aired on Monday night

Showcasing
 her enviable figure in the new advert, a source close to Lucy told 
MailOnline: 'Lucy works out with a celebrity trainer and focuses on her
 bum and legs when she trains, as her upper body is quite naturally 
small. She is a size 6 on the top and an 8 on the bottom.

'She does 
circuits in Richmond Park with her trainer, and then squats and lunges 
with weights. She likes to vary her exercise, so she will do gym work, 
but then also fun outside activities. It's difficult for Lucy to nail 
down a routine, so she works out literally as and when she can, but is 
increasingly trying to make more time for it, as she actually enjoys it.

'Lucy is a
 vegetarian, but she will eat eggs, salmon and spinach for breakfast, or
 porridge with honey. Her vice is macaroni cheese, but she sees this as a
 treat. Lucy eats a lot of fresh fruit and sushi, and does watch what 
she eats.

'Living 
such an active lifestyle, it's important for her to eat properly so she 
has the energy and stamina to keep going during the long working days.'

Style advisor: Speaking about her style, Lucy, who is known for her sartorial wardrobe choices on the show, added: 'I do like getting my legs out, it's one or the other, boobs or legs'

The working days have most certainly been long. Lucy,
 who was this month unveiled as the new face of Lipsy VIP, has also 
turned her hand to writing and last night celebrated the launch of her 
tome, The Dating Game.

Speaking to MailOnline
 about the book, she said: 'I haven't seen any book out there for
 girls, it's ridiculous. I've had quite a few relationships at a young 
age and I wish I'd had someone to give me advice. My book is like an 
older sister.'

Lucy promises that her £12.99 book will 
give you the answers that your friends can’t, many of them learned the 
hard way, as well as rules for first dates, social media, playing hard 
to get and relationship dos and don’ts.

'I've learned a lot and I want to give
 women the strength to do the right things. There are some funny stories 
in there from my past experiences and it's all extremely open and 
honest.'

While she appears thick-skinned on the E4 show, Lucy says that she's been left broken-hearted by past relationships.

Dating guru: Lucy Watson, who shot to fame on 
Made In Chelsea, has penned a new dating guide to help women 'find 
strength' and avoid being played

'I have stayed in horrendous 
relationships,' she confessed. 'I've endured years of crying, losing 
weight, low confidence and ruined myself. I wish I had been stronger.

'I wish I had realised the right time to say to someone, "No, you're not good enough."

'I'm actually a real romantic at heart and I'll do whatever it takes to be with someone that I love.'

The book, which will hit shelves on 
tomorrow, will guide readers through the perilous world of first dates, 
falling in love, break-ups and the emotional minefield of exes, but most
 importantly how a strong woman playing the game should never be played -
 something Lucy now knows all about.

Aside from penning her 
debut tome, Lucy recently posed naked for a PETA campaign, modelled for Vesper dresses and has been working on her jewellery range.

The source added: 'Deliberately, Lucy has made the choice to be super careful about who she works with. Over exposure is really common with reality television stars, and for Lucy, it's always been about the long game. She has turned down far more deals than she has approved.'

Lucy launched her jewellery brand, 
Creature, at the beginning of 2014, and has worked in an ambassadorial 
role for a number of brands.

'Lucy is looking to develop her 
profile in the health and fitness arena, and is looking forward to 
promoting awareness about animal testing, through exploring 
opportunities around creating her own range, as well as wanting to 
create a documentary drawing attention to the issue.

'Lucy has a number of meetings in LA 
and New York planned for the summer, and she has been approached with 
some exciting international opportunities,' added the source.

Speaking about plans for the future, Lucy told MailOnline: 'I
 want to stay in the industry and being on MIC has taught me loads about
 working behind-the-scenes producing and directing, which I love, so 
maybe one day I will look into that.

'I also love presenting and would love to have my own show,' she said.

Bright future: Lucy, pictured with Cheska Hull and Louise Thompson, has dreams of having her own TV sho

Welcome to The Dating Game, people. Way too often, girls fall for 
players who they know are going to screw them over, or they throw 
themselves at guys and wonder why they've never heard from them again, 
or they stay in dead-­end relationships because they are too scared of 
being alone.

These girls aren't strangers, they're me, they're my 
friends, they're all of us. But it's not our fault. Dating nowadays is 
seriously complicated and the more attached we get to someone the more 
confusing it seems to become.

That's why I decided to write this book. 
It's taken a lot of long and painful lessons for me to work out how to 
play the dating game and I've often wished someone could have just told 
me the rules from the start, before I had to learn them the hard way.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I've mastered them all or that 
I've got a perfect track record. In fact, as you will find out in this 
book, my experience of cheats, double betrayals and public scandals 
makes my record far from ideal!

But the dating mistakes I've made and 
the experiences I've had to go through have taught me that I won't put 
up with anybody who doesn't treat me the way I deserve, ever again. I am
never going to settle for just any guy that comes along… it's got to be
the right guy.

And, hopefully after reading my book, neither will you. 
It's about time that we learned how to play men at their own game. In 
The Dating Game, I've hopefully covered all the bases, from being 
single, to going on first dates and figuring out if he's that 
interested, to making a relationship work and even how to get over an 
ex.

I want to make sure that if we play the dating game properly none of
us will be played ever again.
