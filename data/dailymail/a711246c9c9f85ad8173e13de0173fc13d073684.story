The families of two British soldiers killed by a man dressed as a local Afghan policeman have paid tribute to their loved ones.

Married father-of-two Sergeant Gareth Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south of Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province, yesterday.

The soldiers served in 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of Wellington's).

Tributes: Married father-of-two Sergeant Gareth 
Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south of
Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province, yesterday

The men were killed at a checkpoint when a man dressed as a local Afghan policeman pretended to be injured so they would help him, defence sources said.

Sgt Thursby from Skipton, North Yorkshire, is survived by his wife Louise and two children, Joshua and Ruby.

His wife said: 'Gareth was the love of my life. He was an amazing husband and father, happy, full of life and kind hearted with a passion for his work and family. He was brave, hard working, a loving husband who was a devoted father to his children. Our hero.

Special: Thomas Wroe was a much-loved young man who was tragically killed in Afghanistan

Pte Wroe was deployed to Afghanistan on July 1, shortly after his 18th birthday. He is survived by his parents, Michael and Claire, and sister Demi, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire.

His family said in a statement: 'Our son Thomas was a brave young soldier, who is loved by his family, girlfriend and friends.

'We can't believe you have been taken so soon from us. You will always be in our hearts for ever and ever.

'You
would light up the room with your smile and bubbly personality. Our 
world will be a duller place without you. We are so proud of you son, on
all you achieved and we are grateful for every special thing you gave 
us. We will always love you Tom.'

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:
'I was saddened to hear of this cowardly act by a man wearing an Afghan
local police uniform, which has taken the lives of two brave British 
soldiers.

'All of our 
thoughts are with the families of Sergeant Gareth Thursby and Private 
Thomas Wroe. They gave their lives protecting Britain's national 
security, helping to make sure that Afghanistan never again becomes a 
haven for international terrorism.'

Sgt Thursby, who had completed tours of duty in Kosovo and Iraq, was nicknamed Bull because of his strength and confidence.

His
commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Zachary Stenning, said: 'He was 
admired and deeply respected by his soldiers and peers for his 
soldiering skills, physical strength and forthright honesty. Utterly 
professional, his standards were legendary.'

Guard: Earlier this week, two Marines were killed and several more wounded at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan

He
added: 'I heard just a few weeks ago that he had told his platoon to 
call him Dad during the tour. That is how he saw himself; a father 
figure for 30 men and women involved in gruelling operations in 
Helmand.'

Pte Wroe, who joined the Army in September 2010, was praised for his professional skills and positive attitude.

His
company commander, Major Finlay Bibby, said: 'His confidence, sense of 
humour and ever present smile made him hugely popular and fun to be 
with.'

Other fatality: Lance Corporal Duane Groom, 32, from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, died on Friday after his vehicle hit a roadside bomb

He added: 'He was an 
extremely talented soldier who was fulfilling his dream by serving with 
the battalion on operations, the same battalion that his father served 
with.

'I have no doubt that Private Wroe would have achieved great things in the Army.'

The Ministry of Defence said an investigation was under way into the circumstances of the soldiers' deaths.

An MoD spokeswoman said: ‘It is with 
sadness that the Ministry of Defence must announce the death of two 
soldiers from 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment on Saturday September
15 2012.

Major Laurence Roche, of Task Force Helmand, said the Yorkshire Regiment ‘suffered a deep loss’.

He added last night: ‘Everyone serving
within Task Force Helmand will want to send our condolences to the 
soldiers' families and loved ones at this time.’

It has been a bloody few days in the war-torn country.

On Friday Lance Corporal Duane Groom, from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, died after his vehicle hit a roadside bomb.

The MoD said
the deaths were unrelated to the attack at Camp Bastion which killed 
two US Marines.

Those attackers had automatic rifles, 
rocket-propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests. Besides destroying
six Harrier jets, they demolished three refuelling stations and damaged six 
aircraft hangars.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for
that attack, saying it wanted to avenge Muslims insulted by an 
amateurish film that mocked the Prophet Muhammad - and because Prince 
Harry is on the base.

The Prince, who turned 28 on Saturday,
is set to start flying Apache missions this week, and his deployment is
not planned to be shortened after the attack. This is his second tour 
in Afghanistan.

The latest deaths bring the number of 
members of UK forces to have died since operations began in Afghanistan 
in October 2001 to 430.

They came during a bloody few days in the 
war-torn country.

At least one Afghan police officer 
turned his gun on Nato troops at a remote checkpoint in the south today,
killing four US service members before escaping, Afghan and 
international officials said.
