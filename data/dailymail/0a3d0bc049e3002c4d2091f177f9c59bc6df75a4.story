A mother has described how she is living in a 'bad, bad dream' after her daughter was told she would be prosecuted for killing her sibling in a car crash.

Angie Stone said the family was already coping with the grief of losing her son, Gregg, 20, a few months earlier after being shot dead in Afghanistan when daughter Jennie, 29, died in the collision.

Her third child, Rosie-Ann, 20, was behind the wheel of her own car when Jennie's vehicle hit a tree in Fraisthorpe, West Yorkshire, and she is now facing prosecution.

Describing the pain the family has had to cope with already, she said the decision by the CPS was like 'losing another of our babies'.

Tragic: Jennie Stone was killed in February when the car she was travelling in hit a tree. Her sister is being prosecuted for the crash and last year, her brother died in Afghanistan

Mrs Stone, 56, said: 'Have our family not lost enough already? It is like being trapped in a bad, bad dream.'

She, who said the sisters were extremely close, has vowed to fight the decision 'tooth and nail' and said she cannot mourn properly with a court case hanging over the family.

She believes Jennie would be appalled by the CPS’s decision if she was still alive.

She said: 'This is not going to achieve anything at all, no good outcome whatsoever.

'Even Jennie’s son Charlie knew Rosie was in the other car and he said to us "I don’t want anything to happen to you, Rosie. I don’t want you to go to court and get in trouble".

'There is nothing to be achieved apart from destroying the family even more. I thought the CPS was human. Enough, enough, the family have suffered enough.'

A CPS spokeswoman said: 'Rosie-Ann Stone has been reported for summons for driving without due care and causing a fatality.

Private Gregg Thomas Stone, from the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, was the first of the sibling to be killed. He died in Afghanistan on Sunday June 3 2012 when trying to rescue an Afghan policeman

'We are aware of the incredibly emotive circumstances of this case but must adhere to the Code for Crown Prosecutors which requires our lawyers to consider two things.

'The first is whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Where this is met, and it is in this case, we must consider whether it is in the public interest to prosecute.

'To make this decision we have sought the views of all parties including the Stones’ family and Jennie’s immediate family.

'Taking into account all of the information available to us at this time, we have concluded that it is in the public interest to prosecute Rosie-Ann and have advised Humberside Police to report her for summons.'

Jennie, a final-year student at the University of Lincoln’s Hull campus, had been driving a Peugeot 206 towards Bridlington when she was in collision with a Vauxhall Astra, driven by her younger sister Rosie-Ann, before crashing into a tree.

She had just dropped her son Charlie, then aged nine, at Skipsea Primary School.

Ms Stone says Jennie, pictured, would be mortified at the thought of her sister being prosecuted for the car crash

According to police at the time, both cars were travelling in the same direction and were trying to overtake a truck which was also travelling north.

Jennie had moved in with her partner, Dave Parker, just 24 hours before she was killed.

Rosie-Ann Stone is expected to appear in court before magistrates in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, next month.

Her late brother, Private Stone, of the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, was shot dead as he took part in a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman in Helmand Province on June 3 last year. His death left behind wife Sam, who gave birth to his daughter Grace after his death.

An inquest in May found he had been unlawfully killed.
