Next month, she returns to France for concerts in Paris, Chartres and Anet before leaving for Tel Aviv and then in June she plays Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia, and Barcelona, Spain.

Miss Bruni is promoting her fourth LP, Little French Songs, which deals with among other subjects getting older, praying and her marriage.

She says: 'I like getting older. It's really good for your voice, which changes and deepens and evolves with your body.

'It's opened up more musical paths for me.'
