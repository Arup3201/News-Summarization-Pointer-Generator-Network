Campaign: Jack Monroe, a single mother from Essex, writes a blog about her experiences in feeding her son on a £10 a week food budget

Sainsbury's supermarket has named the faces of its new ad campaign as a 25-year-old single mother and a 73-year-old great grandmother.

Ignoring celebrities, the company has brought in 'real' food lovers as part of its new campaign called 'Make Your Roast Go Further'.

The six-week campaign, due to launch in January, is a change in direction for the retail giant which saw Jamie Oliver appearing in its ads for the last ten years.

Sainsbury's parted company with the celebrity chef two years ago and the Telegraph reports they are focusing on real people over celebrities.

Sainsbury's hopes the blogger with help the company connect with struggling families.

Pam Clarkson, a great grandmother from Leeds, Rejina Sabur-Cross, who has written a cookery book called Gastrogeek and Nick Coffer, a father of two from Watford, who blogs about healthy recipes will also feature in the campaign.

The group will share recipes and advise families how to make leftover food from a Sunday roast and one joint of meat last three days.

Sarah Warby, marketing director at Sainsbury's, said: 'In the current economic environment we're all less interested in the ideas of celebrity chefs. We're looking for more help and inspiration from people you really relate to.'
