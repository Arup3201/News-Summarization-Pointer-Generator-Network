She travels the world with her entourage, is loved by millions and is so recognisable that she's regularly stopped in the street: Welcome to the world of Grumpy Cat, the most famous feline on the planet.

But while her famously cross looks might have made her name, her increasingly lucrative brand is all down to her agent, cat specialist Ben Lashes, 35.

Currently in Canada where TV movie Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever is being filmed, Lashes is bubbling over with plans for the future, starting with a Channel 4 documentary starring the sad-faced feline that airs tonight.

Man with a plan: Ben Lashes is the manager behind the internet phenomenon that is Grumpy Cat

But while the documentary has wrapped, the film has not and Lashes declares that he is thrilled with the way it's turning out.

'It's crazy,' he drawls gleefully down the phone from Toronto. 'Last night, we had race car that we crashed into a Santa village and thanks to Hollywood magic, Grumpy is in the car.'

Grumpy, real name Tardar Sauce, was actually nowhere near the crashed car but that doesn't matter to her legions of fans who range in age from nine months to 90.

Such inter-generational appeal means big bucks for Lashes and Grumpy's owners, siblings Tabatha and Bryan Bundesen, and a family-friendly brand of the sort to make advertisers salivate.

Unsurprisingly, Grumpy has gone on to star in numerous ad campaigns, among them US cat food brand Friskies, as well as appearing on official merchandise that ranges from hoodies to 'Grumppuccino' coffee.

But she's not the only the only client of Lashes - real name Benjamin Clark - to be doing well from internet stardom.

Also on his books are Nyan Cat, a cartoon feline with the body of a pop tart, and Keyboard Cat, which shot to posthumous fame thanks to a video which showed it playing the piano.

Human clients include Scumbag Steve, the shifty looking star of a rap album cover that went viral, and Ridiculously Photogenic Guy aka Zeddie Little, a Charleston runner who shot to fame after a snap of him finishing a marathon proved popular online.

This, he says, is a route to becoming a star that is becoming ever more routine and, he adds, isn't just for cats and runners.

'Look at [Justin] Bieber,' he explains. 
'We know his name because he got famous on Youtube, as did Psy and Gangnam Style.

'On Youtube you see actors, 
actresses and musians finding their audience through an online video. It probably 
won't take over completely from the traditional route but it makes it easier for talent to rise to the top.'

Grumpy Cat is a good example of how online fame can translate into big business but Lashes says he has no plans to take on any other cats - unless, of course, they have Grumpy's 'star quality'.

'I don't go after every cat that comes 
out and I haven't picked up a new cat since Grumpy and perhaps I never will,' he confesses.

'My business is more than just cats but cats happen to run the internet. It feels like a 
special moment where cats are overtaking the rest of the entertainment 
industry.'

And that couldn't be more true in Grumpy's case. 'It's been a bit of a whirlwind career,' admits Lashes, who is estimated to have made a 'low six-figure sum' from his involvement with the cat so far.

'She has two books, a movie, she's the
spokescat for Friskies, she has merchandise, although Grumpy herself has been really relaxed through it all.'

So what makes the perfect Hollywood cat other than a docile temperament. According to Lashes, it's all about a Monroe-esque magic.

'I've never been someone who's called up 
every mildly famous cat on the internet,' he insists. 'I'm very picky. To be worth it,
 they have to already be an icon.

'When I first saw Grumpy Cat, she was instantly, to me, something you 
could never forget. So I think that the ones I care about and the ones 
that have the potential to have a brand are the special ones.

'Not every 
cat can do it and become a celebrity just like not every human can become a celebrity. A certain amount of it is magic - the 
thing that makes the Beatles more than four guys playing in a basement.

'All the icons have that - there's a bit of that cosmic aura about them. 
That's the kind of thing Grumpy Cat has and she brings smiles to everyone.'

And Lashes isn't exaggerating. Book signings attract huge crowds while appearances on shows such as Good Morning America send ratings soaring. No wonder Lashes is pleased.

So what's next for the world's most famous cat? Lashes isn't telling. 'I'm planning to have this movie finished
 up in the next few weeks, we'll take a break in the fall and then 
unveil it to the world in late November as a Christmas gift for all of Grumpy Cat's 
fans.

'For next year, people are going to just have stay tuned.'
