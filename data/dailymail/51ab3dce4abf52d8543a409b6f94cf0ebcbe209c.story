Warm weather has sent British Gas profits tumbling by 26 per cent, as customers turned their heating off.

The energy giant made £265million less in the first half of this year than it did in 2013, despite hiking its prices at the onset of winter.

Consumer groups said families were still being hit with price rises, after the watchdog Ofgem warned energy suppliers were making an increasing amount of money from the typical household, up to £106 for the coming year.

British Gas parent company also saw profits fall, down 35 per cent to £1.03 billion.

Chief executive Sam Laidlaw said: 'With challenging trading conditions on both sides of the Atlantic in the first half, earnings will be lower in 2014 than in 2013. However, the group is well positioned to return to growth in 2015.' 

He went on: 'This is a business that is very affected by the weather and we had two unusual phenomena this year.

'Firstly, we had warmer weather in the UK which meant actually our average customer's consumption of gas was down 24 per cent.

'We also simultaneously had very cold weather in the US - the Polar Vortex - which resulted in generating companies charging us with a lot of additional sort of ancillary costs.

'The combination of those two meant that at the group level the profit was down. We see a much better picture for the second half of the year.'

British Gas serves around 11 million homes. Last autumn it ratcheted up his prices by 9.2 per cent before trimming charges by around £50 after the government removed some so-called green levies on bills.

But Centrica said the average bill was expected to be £90, or 7 per cent, lower this year reflecting warmer weather and energy efficiency measures.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: 'British Gas profits are down because of a warm winter, not lower prices. Ofgem reports that supplier profit margins are set to double, while energy costs continue to be the top consumer concern.

'Energy companies must do everything they can to pass on any savings to their customers including falling wholesale and network costs. 

'That's why we need the competition authority to establish whether the price we pay for our energy is fair.'

British Gas has come under pressure to cut bills after Ofgem pointed to falling wholesale gas and electricity prices - while it is also facing a full-scale competition probe which could see it vulnerable to a break-up.

However latest figures from the regulator suggesting rising pre-tax profit margins from household supply are disputed by industry body Energy UK.

Separate figures from French-owned EDF - another of the so-called Big Six suppliers, serving around four million households - showed that operating profits in the UK rose 9.5 per cent to £560 million for the first half of the year.

It said the growth was the result of higher output from its nuclear power stations, compared with a period last year when more of its generating capacity was out of service for planned maintenance.

EDF said a decline in gas sales due to milder weather was partly offset by 3.2 per cent growth in customer accounts.
