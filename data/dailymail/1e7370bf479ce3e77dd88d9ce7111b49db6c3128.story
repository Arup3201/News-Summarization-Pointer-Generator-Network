Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will make a personal plea to Thibaut Courtois to stay at the club next season following the Champions League final.

The future of goalkeeper Courtois will be one of the key issues for Chelsea to resolve this summer.

The Belgian was expected to rejoin Atletico Madrid for a fourth consecutive season-long loan deal once he signed a new Blues contract.

Plea: And Mourinho wants the Belgian to stay at Stamford Bridge next season instead of going back on loan

There is a feeling Courtois would benefit from another 12 months at the Vicente Calderon before returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2015/16 season.

However, Mourinho wants Courtois to return to west London next season to compete with Petr Cech for the No 1 jersey.

Mourinho and Courtois are yet to hold face-to-face talks with regarding the keeper's future, with the Portuguese taking the decision to wait until the end of Atletico's season before speaking to the Belgium international.

But the Special One is due to meet 
with the 21-year-old in the days after the all-Madrid Champions League 
final on May 24, where he will tell Courtois he wants him to play for 
Chelsea next season.

Courtois is settled in the Spanish capital and would happily stay with Atletico for another season.

After establishing himself as one of the best keepers in Europe this season, sitting on the bench at Chelsea next season does not appeal to Courtois.

However, Courtois must follow Chelsea's instructions given he still has two years to run on his deal, though the Blues are keen not to upset the goalkeeper given he is yet to sign a new Blues contract.

Fail: Mourinho has overseen only Chelsea's fourth season without a trophy in the Roman Abramovich era
