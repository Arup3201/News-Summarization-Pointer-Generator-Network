An unemployed mother of six who lives on benefits and has just moved into a £150,000 four-bedroom council house has boasted on Facebook about her taxypayer-funded lifestyle.

Neither Maggie Flisher, 26, nor her husband Gavin, 31, have worked since the birth of their first child in 2005, and instead the couple collect around £27,000 a year in benefits.

Now Mrs Flisher, who claims that she is 'super-fertile' which makes contraception impossible, has gloated shamelessly on the internet about 'haters' who criticise her state-subsidised life.

Enjoying a state-funded life: Gavin and Maggie Flisher, who have moved into a new housing association house with Lacieann, eight, (centre, rear) Elektra, six, (far left) Gavin Jnr, five, (centre), Lilyrose, two, (right) and three-month-old twins Paris Nicola and Martinjames (front left and right), say their critics are simply envious

She wrote that working was 'a mug's game', adding: 'Why work when I can legally take your hard-earned money and you can't say s*** to me?'

In a series of provocative messages on the social networking site, Mrs Flisher, who says depression prevents her from getting a job, suggested those whom she said were 'jealous' of her many benefits should do the same.

She said critics who wanted a bigger house should ask the government for one, suggesting that that was what they were there for, and said that she, who hasn't worked since she was 21, had had enough of working.

In another post, she boasted of enjoying a midweek night out at her local pub, saying: 'Just been out and got STEAMING... love spending all my money that you HATERS don't', the Sun reported.

And in another post, she boasted that what she was doing was perfectly legal, and suggested those who were outraged by it were simply envious.

The Flishers have just moved into a spacious terraced house after complaining for years that their old one-bedroom council flat in Maidstone, Kent, was too small.

The Flishers moved into their new house last month after complaining their pleas for a new house were ignored

Last month the jobless couple moved in to the housing association house in Tovil with children Lacieann, eight, Elektra, six, Gavin Jr, five, Lilyrose, two, and six-month-old twins Paris Nicole and Martin James.

Mrs Flisher said most of her pregnancies were a result of contraceptive failure - she said she had tried, and been let down by, the Pill, condoms, arm implants and a contraceptive injection.
