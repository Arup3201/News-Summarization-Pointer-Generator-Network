Union bosses have spent thousands battling to reinstate two bullying nurses at the centre of the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal.

Sharon Turner, 44, and Tracy White, 47, were struck off last year for ruling their wards through fear.

But it has now emerged that the Royal College of Nursing spent £4,000 trying to get the decision reversed at the High Court

The union – which claims to promote excellence in care standards – paid lawyers to argue that the damning evidence against the nurses was just ‘hearsay.’ 

A judge threw out the case in a one-day hearing earlier this month, ruling that it was indisputable for the pair to remain barred.

The union, which is funded by nurses’ subscription fees, initially refused to say how much it spent on the case later admitted it cost £4,000.

Families who lost loved ones at Mid Staffordshire are now demanding to know why an organisation that supposedly promotes excellence tried to reinstate Turner and White.

Scandal: It has now emerged that the Royal College of Nursing spent £4,000 trying to get the decision reversed at the High Court. The two nurses are at the centre of the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal

Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at the trust between 2005 and 2009 and the authority is currently facing a multimillion-pound fine over a string of care blunders that led to the death of a diabetic patient.

Today, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce the dissolution of Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust – which is currently in administration and which experts say has become a ‘toxic’ brand.

Tracy White forged waiting times, humiliated the elderly and made vulnerable patients wait at the A&E unit.

The former ward sister, 47, routinely ordered junior staff to massage data and once refused to lift a frail elderly patient.

Whistleblowers said the woman, who died the next day, had been given ‘a very uncared-for and undignified last 24 hours’.

Sharon Turner, by her own admission, did not ‘give a flying f***’ about patients and also helped fiddle care figures. 

The
 44-year-old casualty nurse branded Asian doctors ‘suicide bombers’ and 
said of a male nurse that she had bullied into an attempted overdose 
that he should have ‘done the job properly’.

Some of the worst neglect at the Stafford hospital occurred in the A&E unit where staff admitted they became ‘immune to the sound of pain’.

Turner and White were said to have ruled the casualty unit with fear, presiding over a ‘toxic’ environment by bullying young nurses to fiddle care figures.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council struck the pair off in July to protect the public after what it said was among the worst cases it had seen. They are two of only four nurses to have been struck off for their involvement in the scandal.

But campaigners and grieving families last night condemned the nursing union for trying to allow them to carry on working.

They also accuse it of failing to stick up for whistleblowing nurses who have lost their jobs after speaking out about poor care.

Jennie Fecitt, lead nurse at Patients First, a campaign group that represents whistleblowers, said: 'Although Patients First cannot directly quote on this case, it believes every nurse must have the right to representation. 

'Some of our members have stated they are deeply upset and disappointed that they are not supported by unions when they have raised concerns about patient safety.'

Julie Bailey, who set up campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother died at Mid Staffordshire, said: ‘Nurses are paying their subscription fees only for the RCN to use it too defend bullying and racist nurses. I think the public would be horrified to know what is going on.’

Last year Mr Hunt implied the union was partly to blame for the Mid Staffordshire scandal because it was too preoccupied with sticking up for bullying nurses.

Following a damning report, the RCN later resisted calls to split into a union and a professional body.

A spokesman for the union, which has about 410,000 UK members who pay annual fees of up to £200, said: ‘In this instance, we felt it was fair and appropriate to represent the defendants in their High Court appeal due to anonymous hearsay evidence having been submitted at the NMC hearing.’

An RCN spokesperson said: 'All of our members are entitled to representation at Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearings.

'In this instance, we felt it was fair and appropriate to represent the defendants in their High Court appeal due to anonymous hearsay evidence having been submitted at the NMC hearing.

'Indeed those findings which were based on hearsay evidence were quashed by Justice Mitting, upholding an important principle of fairness.'
