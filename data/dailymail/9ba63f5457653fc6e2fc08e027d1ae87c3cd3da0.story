A former Olympic wrestler died of a broken heart just weeks after his wife of 65 years passed away.

Within days of Herbie Hall's wife Ethel dying, the star grappler, was rushed into hospital.

Mr Hall represented Great Britain at the
1952 and 1956 Olympics and won silver for England at the 1954 
Commonwealth Games in Vancouver.

True love: Herbie Hall with his wife Ethel on their golden wedding anniversary. Mr Hall was beside himself with sadness when his wife died

Doctors told his family that tests 
showed there was nothing medically wrong with Mr Hall but that he was 
suffering from a broken heart.

Three weeks later, he suffered a heart attack and could not be saved.

Niece Tracey-Jayne Mawdsley, 47, from Springhead, Oldham, said: 'Herbie just wanted to be with Ethel.

'They had been together for 70 years and married for 65 and he was lost 
without her. He was beside himself with sadness.'

Mr Hall married his 'Queen' Ethel at Christ Church in Chadderton in 1948. The pair had met six years earlier at a nearby swimming pool.

They remained in love for six decades but after being diagnosed with dementia in 2009, Mrs Hall had to be moved into a care home.

But Mr Hall could not stand to be apart from his sweetheart and his family were forced to find a home that would allow the pair of them to stay together in one room.

They were moved from their home in Scouthead, Oldham, to Avalon Park Care Home in nearby Salem, where they stayed together for four years until Mrs Hall caught pneumonia.

She passed away, aged 85, in hospital on January 25.

Mr Hall was admitted to hospital seven days after his wife's death.

When doctors could not find anything medically wrong with him, he went back to the care home - but three weeks later he suffered a heart attack and died on his way to hospital on February 26 - what would have been Ethel's 86th birthday.

His niece added: 'The last month has been very difficult losing them both. But the one thing that has made it more bearable is knowing that they are together now.

'Herbie used to call Ethel his Queen and he was so sad when she had gone. They just wanted to be by each other's side again. There is no doubt in my mind he died of a broken heart.'

Mr Hall, whose parents emigrated with him to a farm in Canada before returning home, had a glittering career in wrestling and toured the world.

He was a member of Bolton United Harriers and was named in the Guinness Book of Records as featherweight champion of England during his heyday in the 1950s.

'Nowadays he would be a celebrity,' Ms Mawdsley said. 'But he didn't like to talk about his success, especially in the pub.

'He always said if people overheard him in the pub they would challenge him to a fight.'

When his career in wrestling came to an end in the early 1960s, Mr Hall worked in a mill in Shaw, while wife was a winder in the cotton mills.

They never had any children, but his niece added: 'They loved their family and all their nieces and nephews.

'They were a brilliant aunty and uncle - they were like second parents to us all. I will really miss them both.'
