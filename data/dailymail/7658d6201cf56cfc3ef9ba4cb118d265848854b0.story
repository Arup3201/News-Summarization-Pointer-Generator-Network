Cardiff City manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists that the scandal surrounding Malky Mackay and Iain Moody will not have an impact on his team's performance this weekend.

A Sportsmail investigation led to allegatinons of racist, sexist homophobic text messages sent by Mackay and Moody while they were working for the club.

But, speaking before his side's trip to Wolves, Solskjaer, who replaced Mackay last season, was adament that his team would remain focused on football. 

Focus: Solksjaer insists his side will be concentrating on the task at hand this weekend

Fine start: Cardiff have made a strong start to life  in the Championship, earning seven points in three games

'Football wise I am sure the boys just concentrate on the game tomorrow,' he said. 'We have been focused and had a good start. I don’t think it will affect anyone's performance.'

'The boys have shown to me before that when we have had off-field media (last season) it hasn’t affected them. In the longer term it did last season, loads of off-field stuff.' 

'But I'm sure the boys are just looking forward to the game. The mood at the start of a season is different, you are just looking forward to the games.'

Scandal: Malky Mackay's alleged text messages could prove a distraction to his former club

Trigger: The allegations came to light as part of an investigation by owner Vincent Tan into Mackay's conduct

'We are just handling the situation as it is now. We are developing as a team, thinking about tomorrow and 100 per cent focused on the game.'

Solksjaer was keen to shift the attention back to his team and away from the club's former manager, but did state that he had never experienced racism in football. 

'For me, I know there will be headlines if I talk too much,' he continued. 'From my point of view I have had no problem with that (racism) in my experience.'

Implicated: Former head of player recruitment Iain Moody is also involved in the scandal

Solskjaer, who played for Man United for 11 years, says he has never experienced racism in English football

'Let’s stick to the game. Other people's opinions you cant control. I have come in eight months ago to control footballing matters and I want my team and club to be thought of highly. 

'For me, I think we have a great group of hungry, humble players. we are showing we are better than last year.'
