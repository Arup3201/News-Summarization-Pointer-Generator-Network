With two divorces behind him, one of which revealed his taste for drinking and prostitutes, the queen’s cousin may have been forgiven for turning his back on the institution of marriage.

But the 18th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne has now walked down the aisle for a third time.

Michael Bowes-Lyon, 55, made   former shop manager and divorced mother-of-two Karen Baxter his new Countess last weekend in a low-key ceremony in the grounds of his £12 million seat, Glamis Castle, near Forfar, Angus.

The troubled aristocrat’s family, including his mother Mary, Dowager Countess of Strathmore, and his four sons are said to be ‘delighted’.

The happy couple, who became engaged last year, first met while Mrs Baxter was manager of an ironmongers near Forfar. The Earl acquired the business six years ago while still married to his second wife, Damaris.

Mrs Baxter later became financial manager of one of Strathmore’s companies and, following the end of his second marriage,  is said to have become a ‘highly positive’ influence on him.

Yesterday, a spokesman for the peer, who is one of Scotland’s richest men, said: ‘The Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne married Karen Baxter in a quiet ceremony at Glamis on Saturday, August 4. Both families are delighted.’

The former Scots Guards captain – known as Mikey to his friends – and his first wife, Isobel, split in 2004 after a 20-year marriage. They have three sons.

It was during the break-up that the Earl was exposed in a Sunday newspaper for hiring three prostitutes and indulging in a four-day ‘sex marathon’ at his second stately home, Holwick Lodge, in Co Durham.

After the revelations, the Earl expressed his regret, issuing a statement saying the event had happened during ‘an extremely difficult phase’ in his life. His solicitor also said the Earl had been drinking heavily.

A year later, the peer, who is the late Queen Mother’s great-nephew and a first cousin once removed of the Queen, married clinical psychologist Damaris. They have a seven-year-old son, Toby. Within three years, however, the marriage also ended in divorce.

According to friends, the Earl  – who walked behind Prince Charles and Prince William at the Queen Mother’s funeral – has now found ‘complete contentment’ with Mrs Baxter. She has been separated from her first husband, the father of her two daughters, for a considerable time.
