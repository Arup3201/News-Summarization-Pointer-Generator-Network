England's Lee Westwood will look to complete a unique double at Kuala Lumpur golf and country club this week.

Westwood is part of a 78-strong field for the CIMB Classic, which is co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour and Asian Tour and is being held on the same course where he won the Maybank Malaysian Open on the European Tour in April.

And the former world number one could then make it an impressive three wins on the same course in 10 months, with the Malaysian Open switching to February on the 2015 European Tour schedule.

'I'm playing nicely at the moment,' Westwood told a pre-tournament press conference. 'I played well in Napa (finishing 12th at the Frys.com Open) a couple of weeks ago and it's nice for me that it's a nice setting here.'

Westwood won his 13th tournament in Asia the week after finishing seventh in the Masters and added: 'I played it at 18-under-par and won by seven so you'd have to say it suits my game. That was a great week and it's strange I'm going to be playing three tournaments in 10 months on this golf course.

'It doesn't often happen and there's obviously the reason for that...it's obviously a good golf course because they keep putting tournaments around it and people enjoy playing it.

'I'm the most recent winner around this golf course so I'm pretty confident as far as this week's tournament is concerned.' 

Westwood has won in Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, Macau and Malaysia and knows exactly what is needed to succeed in the testing conditions which can usually be relied upon to spark afternoon thunderstorms.

'You're not going to function if you get dehydrated out there and lose energy,' the 41-year-old added. 'Your brain is going to stop working and then you need to use your common sense and have good course-management skills.

'I think there are a lot of opportunities to take holes on out there, but at the same time there are a lot of opportunities to play conservatively and take par on certain holes. You don't want to be coming out of the rough, because the greens seem to stay firm.' 

Westwood will play alongside Ryder Cup team-mate Sergio Garcia and Gleneagles opponent Patrick Reed in the first two rounds.

The winner will claim $1.2million from the overall prize fund of $7million, as well as a place in next year's Masters at Augusta.
