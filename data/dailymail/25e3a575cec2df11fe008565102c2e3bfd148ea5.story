Parents, fear not: another shipment of merchandise for Disney mega-hit Frozen is on its way to the UK.

Disney has confirmed more clothing, dolls and soft toys based on the blockbuster animated musical has been ordered to deal with the shortage in British shops.

It follows the runaway success of the film which, despite a lukewarm response from critics, has become a massive hit among children.

That, of course, meant the inevitable demands followed for toys and costumes like Elsa's shimmering blue dress or Anna's caped ensemble and plaited wig.

But demand became so high both sides of the Atlantic that Disney started selling out as stock ran low.

Disney even had to impose quotas on some of the 
merchandise to create an 'equitable way' to buy the most popular 
stuffed animals and dolls.

Shoppers on the Disney website can put only 
one of the £15 Elsa and Anna dolls in their basket and in the U.S. some 
stores have even been running lotteries to buy the products.

In the UK, as Frozen-mania gripped Britain's schoolchildren, Disney admitted that the industry had underestimated the film's success.

Now, Disney says relief is on the way.

Dresses based on Disney's mega-hit Frozen have been selling on eBay for £600

At the end of March a post on UK parenting forum Mumsnet showed the extent of 
  the problem.

User olafthesnowman wrote: 'I need desperate help 
  mumsnetters!' before explaining that the only place to find an Elsa 
  dress costume in size 7 to 8 was on eBay, where the £18 dress was selling 
  for upwards of £80.

The post received several replies, with users saying 
  they had found 'Frozen stuff a nightmare to get hold of'.

And while Disney Elsa costumes are selling for as much as £600 on eBay and more than 25 bids on some lots, costume-makers are jumping on the bandwagon to create their own Frozen-inspired outfits for young fans at the price of up to £100.

Online marketplace Amazon tells a similar story, with dresses on sale for more than £150.

'The popularity of Frozen has been 
phenomenal,' a Disney UK spokesman told The Observer.

'We are thrilled that 
audiences have connected with the characters and story in the way that 
they have and we are working hard to keep bringing additional product 
into stores as quickly as possible.'

On the Mumsnet website, members regularly swap intelligence on how to track down the coveted 'Elsa dress'.

While on eBay, sellers are making a healthy profits flogging products for as much as £600.

'I've found Frozen stuff a nightmare to get hold of,' complained one member, The Guardian reported. 'The dolls are in and out of stock everywhere and vary massively in price.

The only clothing I could find was a T-shirt in Tesco that I bought in desperation in the end!'

Frozen, based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen, is officially a blockbuster franchise after it overtook Toy Story 3 in March to become the highest grossing animated film of all time, raking in $1 billion (£644.5 million) at the box office.

It was in the UK box office top 10 for more than three months and now ranks as the 10th highest grossing film in cinema history.

Despite a lukewarm critical response, the film won two Oscars, and its songs, penned by Broadway duo Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, topped the US Billboard 200 chart for 13 consecutive weeks.

A Broadway musical is also now in development.
