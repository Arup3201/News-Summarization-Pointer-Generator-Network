The amazing recovery of flesh-eating victim Aimee Copeland shows no signs of slowing down after her father revealed she can now feed herself and brush her teeth after just four days of rehab.

Andy Copeland announced the news on his Facebook page on Saturday along with his recent blog posting entitled 59 Days.

'Just a quick note: Aimee fed herself today for the first time. She can also now brush her own teeth,' he wrote. 'How's that for only 4 full days of rehab? Yeah, I'm beaming from ear-to-ear right now.'

Happy: After nearly two months of battling the rare infection, called necrotizing fasciitis, Copeland was all smiles as she finally left the hospital after having four limbs amputated

In his blog posting about the 24-year-old's progress, he revealed how much the family will need for Aimee's prosthetic limbs and their battle with the insurance company to extend the coverage of their current medical plan.

'We have come to realize that $150,000 for prosthetics may have been a conservative estimate. Aimee will require a set of body-powered limbs and a set of myo-electric limbs.

'She will also require ongoing fittings for the ever-changing condition of her amputated limbs, which is required for continued comfort.

'I have pleaded with our insurance company to extend the coverage of prosthetics beyond the stingy annual sum of $50,000 that is allowed under our medical plan.

'Surely they realize that there are not a plethora of quad-amputees in existence and that Aimee's extraordinary condition requires extraordinary care and coverage.'

The city of Snellville, where the family is from, presented the Copelands with a cheque for $16,500 last week after a 5K fundraiser was held in her honor.

Aimee was released from an Augusta hospital last week after six weeks of recovery, at the beginning of which the doctors warned her family that she would likely die.

The student fell from a zip line on May 1 and the flesh-eating bacteria necrotizing fasciitis entered her blood stream through an open wound, which was not detected until she was rushed to hospital days later.

She has since had her left leg, right foot and hands amputated and will have to spend the next two months in a rehabilitation center to adjust.

The family are making preparations for her return from rehab by adding an 'Amy wing' to their home.

The 1,800 sq ft two-storey addition 
will have a bedroom, fitness room, sunroom and study, where she can work
on her master's degree.

An elevator will allow her to go wherever she wants - and it's all being built by volunteers touched by her sad story.

Her
father Andy said: 'Right now our house is not Aimee-friendly because 
it's very small and compact. We're going to add an Aimee wing.'

'While she's getting better, we need to have this house prepared so she has a good viable home to come to.'

He also revealed last week it is her dream to be able to walk in time for her graduation in December.

Recovery: Aimee's mother said her daughter was motivated to go and get her rehab started as soon as possible and they hopes the clinic could also do something about the pain she is in

Her said: 'It's amazing the things we take for granted, like the ability to get up and go fix a cup of coffee and sit back down again.

'She has to relearn that ability, to get up and get whatever she needs to satisfy her. She needs to be able to have some mobility in her life again but as we speak that process has already started, she is already 30 minutes into her first rehab session.'

Aimee was pictured leaving the hospital earlier this week smiling and showing off her amputated limbs as she clutched onto a doll.

She seemed happy and comfortable to pose with hospital workers as she left hospital and when she was in the ambulance.

Her mother Donna told Today: 'She was very excited when we got in the ambulance but it didn't take long before it was lights out. She fell asleep the whole way but when we got there she couldn't wait to get started, she is so motivated.'

Copeland's speedy recovery has defied 
doctors' initial prognosis. Her father says they at first gave her just a
slim chance of surviving. She spent weeks sedated and using a 
respirator while undergoing amputations and skin grafts to replace 
infected skin

Her father Andy spoke to msnbc about how momentous an occasion it was for Aimee to leave hospital.

'I think you could say that she's looking forward to it to the same degree that a child would look forward to leaving high school and going off to college, for her this is a major milestone.

Proud: Her father, Andy Copeland, holds up the photo during an interview with Good Morning America

'I would consider it a rite of passage for her as it is the opportunity that she has to actually venture out and relearn her life skills and be able to resume as normal a life as she can have.

'I believe her life can be extremely normal, whatever that word actually means. I think physically she's actually progressed rapidly, certainly far ahead of the doctor's schedule, what they thought she would do.

'I would say spiritually, mentally, psychologically she is so strong right now and for her, to actually be able to grasp the concept that she's lost her hands and feels blessed over that is an amazing thing.'

Speaking to GMA, her father spoke of her determination to walk at her Master's graduation ceremony this December. 'You heard the word right,' he said. 'Walk. That's what she intends to do.'

Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal. Her agony was so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication.

The
student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her 
convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in 
holistic medicine.
