ESPN has pulled out of a documentary collaboration with Frontline which examines head injuries sustained by football players and the response of the NFL that has been in the making for 15 months, allegedly due to pressure from the NFL.

The sports network, which cited a lack of editorial control for its decision, is owned by the Walt Disney Company and broadcasts Monday Night Football, a big money spinner for Disney.

According the The New York Times, two insiders say that ESPN came under immense pressure from the NFL to pull out of the project after a trailer for the documentary was released August 6.

Grave concern: The documentary ESPN has pulled out of will discuss evidence that the NFL knew head injuries sustained by football players lead to permanent cognitive disability

Frontline, the respected longform journalism series, had been working with ESPN on the documentary for more than a year. It was due to air in October.

According to the two insiders, last week NFL and ESPN top brass convened at a Manhattan restaurant for a meeting in which league officials expressed their displeasure with the direction of the documentary.

According to the The New York Times, the meeting of Roger Goodell, commissioner of the NFL Steve Bornstein, president of the NFL Network; ESPN’s president John Skipper; and John Wildhack, ESPN’s executive vice president for production was 'combative'.

The documentary details allegations that the NFL turned a blind eye to evidence that players were suffering degenerative brain disorders linked to trauma sustained on the field.

Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the NFL said that the lunch meeting had been planned long in advance and that 'At no time did we formally or informally ask them to divorce themselves from the project.' 

ESPN also denies having been pressured to drop the highly anticipated project.

League of their own: The planned documentary is called 'League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis'

'The decision... was not a result of concerns about our separate business relationship with the NFL. As we have in the past including as recently as Sunday, we will continue to cover the concussion story aggressively through our own reporting,' said a statement released by the company.

But producers of Frontline say that ESPN had been aware of and agreed to the rules of the collaboration, which stipulated that Frontline had editorial control of the content it televised or put online, and that ESPN, likewise, would control the content released under its banner. 'We were about to share a cut of our film with them,' producer Raney Aronson-Rath told the Times, 'and we welcomed their input.'

She says that last Friday was the first time she was told by ESPN that the company didn't want its logos used in connection with the film.

'It didn’t appear that it was their decision,' she said.

Despite ESPN's withdrawal from the films, brothers and ESPN reporters Steve Fainaru and Mark Fainaru-Wada remain heavily involved in the film.

The are the authors of the book League of Denial: The NFL, Concussions and the Battle for Truth, set to be published October 8, and contribute extensively to the Frontline documentary.
