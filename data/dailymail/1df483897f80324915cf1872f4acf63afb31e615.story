This footage captures the 'skin-crawling' moment a man discovers three live grubs in an OXO cube about to be crumbled into a meal.

James Pearson, 35, of Telford, Shropshire, filmed the maggot-like creatures wriggling around on his kitchen unit after breaking the cube in front of his girlfriend, Charlotte, 22.

Another of the slimy yellow creepy crawlies was living in a second cube from the same pack - and all of the specimens have been sent to the local environmental health agency for investigation.

Gross: The yellow grubs wriggle around on the kitchen unit after being discovered in an OXO cube

Mr Pearson said: 'It was my girlfriend Charlotte who spotted them - at first they looked like little bits of noodle. 

'But then it looked like something was actually embedded in the cube.

'Obviously when we saw what it was I was shocked to see these maggot like things which were about to go into her dinner.

'The cubes were bought around March this year and we'd used about four from the pack already which is a little skin-crawling when we imagine there were more in other cubes.'

He added: 'She was making rice and was about to put the OXO cube in to give it a little bit of flavour - but noticed that the cube's texture felt different.

'She definitely went off her dinner after that. 

'The following day I went to crumble another cube and something pinged out of it and I almost lost sight of it.'

Mr Pearson said the cubes had nine months left on their use-by-date but claims their texture was far more gooey than usual.

He added: 'It's quite possible one of them was sprinkled into a previous meal we'd eaten, it's not something you usually look out for. 

'And for someone who is prone to gastrointestinal distress-  it doesn't fill me with joy.'

Mr Pearson contacted Premier Foods, who make OXO cubes, and they requested he send them the box of cubes and the grubs so that they could investigate.

But he instead decided to contact the environmental health agency so they could look into the incident independently.

He added: 'I am not looking for compensation. Premier Foods said that they would replace the cubes but I won't be losing sleep over that. 

'It's more about public awareness. It's unacceptable to be finding live insects in food products and if this prevents it happening again then that's a good thing.

A spokesman for Premier Foods, who make OXO cubes, said: 'Premier Foods takes pride in the quality of our food products and we take any complaint incredibly seriously. 

'Our customer service team and Mr Pearson have recently been in contact so that we can investigate the complaint but unfortunately the product was never returned to us. 

'We understand that the Environmental Health Office has now been informed and we are cooperating fully with their investigation.'

A spokesman for the local council's enviormental health department said: 'I can confirm that Telford & Wrekin Council has received a complaint from a member of the public about live grubs in a chicken OXO cube that was purchased from a local shop. 

'The member of the public decided that he wanted the council's environmental health team to deal with the issue on his behalf.

'In keeping with normal procedures when a complaint relates to an item of food made somewhere else, we have contacted Bassetlaw District Council and asked them to investigate. 

'We have also sent samples of the cubes to them.'
