Ford will end more than a century of vehicle production in the UK next week when its Transit van factory closes its doors for the last time.

The shutdown of the Southampton plant will affect 531 workers, with a further 750 jobs hit by the axe falling on a tool and stamping operation at Dagenham, Essex.

Both plants will close by July 26. When the announcement was made last October, union officials accused the U.S. company of 'betrayal' and said the job losses were 'devastating'.

It is estimated that more than 2.2million Transits have been made in Southampton in the past 40 years. Production will now switch to Turkey where, Ford says, costs are 'significantly lower' than anywhere in Europe, even after delivery charges.

The plant in Kocaeli is much bigger than the one now closing in Southampton, with the Turkey plant producing around 185,000 vans last year compared to just 28,000 on the South Coast.

Ford Europe, Middle East and Africa claimed to have taken pains to make sure that the livelihoods of the Southampton workers were not destroyed by their decision to take their operations elsewhere.

Stephen Odell, president of Ford's EMEA unit, said the company had 'provided individual support to ensure that all employees have made fully informed decisions about their future on a voluntary basis.'

'We are re-affirming our commitment to the UK with a major investment in powertrain and engineering, which reinforces the UK's central role in Ford's global powertrain strategy and commercial vehicle engineering,' he said.

Finding a future: A Ford spokesman said that all of the 531 employees at the Southampton plant had 'either chosen redeployment within Ford, voluntary separation or early retirement' with 'new and expanded Ford operations created in Southampton providing positions for 134 of these employees'

End of an era: The closure of the Southampton and Dagenham plants will be another nail in the coffin of Britain's mass manufacturing economy

A Ford spokesman said that all of the 531 employees at the Southampton plant had 'either chosen redeployment within Ford, voluntary separation or early retirement' with 'new and expanded Ford operations created in Southampton providing positions for 134 of these employees'.

He added: 'A further 41 Southampton employees have taken up positions at other Ford locations in the UK and so far 41 employees have taken up offers of alternative employment outside the company.'

A vehicle distribution centre costing £12million is being created at Southampton docks with a vehicle refurbishment centre being set up at the plant site.

The spokesman said: 'The distribution centre will form part of Ford's logistics operations, involved in import vehicle handling and onward distribution, and the shipping of engines to China.

'Low mileage used vehicles will be processed by the refurbishment centre for supply to the Ford Direct sales programme.'

Ford is also to donate six Transits to charities local to both the Dagenham and Southampton sites, which are also to benefit from a £1million community fund to be shared between the two locations

The spokesman said that the 750 employees affected by the Dagenham closure have also either accepted redundancy, early retirement or had been redeployed within the company.

He continued: 'Ford is investing £1.9million at Dagenham to establish a new powertrain tool room within the engine plant.

'Together with other positions in the local area this has enabled a total of 400 employees from Dagenham Stamping and Tooling Operations to be redeployed within the company and a number of others are pursuing employment opportunities outside Ford.'

Ford is also to donate six Transits to charities local to both of the sites which are also to benefit from a £1million community fund to be shared between the two locations.

He added: 'The fund is being used to support local employability and education initiatives.'

The shells of Ford transit vans move along on the production line: Ford said it had been in discussions with local authorities and other key stakeholders on how the old production sites can be reused

The last Transit to be produced at Southampton would be added to the company's 100-vehicle heritage collection, he added.

The spokesman added: 'Ford has been conducting studies into the Southampton and Dagenham stamping and tooling sites. The studies cover areas such as environmental remediation, legal and planning matters and future potential uses of the sites.

'It is expected that the sites will be secured for employment usage and Ford will hold detailed discussions with local authorities and other key stakeholders on the options for their marketing and re-use.'
