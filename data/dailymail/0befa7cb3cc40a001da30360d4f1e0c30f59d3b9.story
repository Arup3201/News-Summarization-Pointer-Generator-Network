A man was caught trying to smuggle more than $770,000 out of the U.S. in cash hidden in boxes of drug store products, officials said.

Abdulkarim Altareb, 48, from Yemen, insisted the wads of crisp banknotes belonged to him and 'his brothers' when he was busted by suspicious customs officials at New York's JFK Airport.

He is now in jail charged with 'bulk cash smuggling', but police sources told the New York Post there was no indication the money was meant for terrorist groups.

Loadsamoney: Packs of common drug store products and even a pair of trainers were used to conceal more than $770,000 which Abdulkarim Altareb was caught with as he tried to board a flight to Qatar on Sunday

Not so clean getaway: Packs of Dove soap were used to conceal wads of crisp dollar notes in Altareb's luggage. He said the money was for building works and police sources say they don't suspect terrorism

Altareb had claimed he was carrying just $6,500 - well under the $10,000 limit - before trying to board a plane to Qatar on Sunday, according to court papers seen by the Post.

But when asked to present the cash he pulled out just $5,870, stoking the suspicions of U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers who then decided to search his luggage.

Inside they found boxes of soap, Band-Aids, Thera-flu, Splenda and Alka-Seltzer, all stuffed with thick rolls of $100 and $50 bills.

'Cash was also hidden in soles of shoes, and in the lining of a jacket inside of one of the checked bags,' a court filing said.

Under interrogation, Altareb is said to have told Homeland Security agents he was taking the money to the Middle East to fund building works.

'This is my brothers’, two brothers’ money,' he told them according to the criminal complaint.

It added: 'The defendant also said, in sum and substance, that some of the money was his money, and some of the money belonged to his family, and that he has a big family.'

Suspicious behaviour: Altareb had claimed he was carrying just $6,500 - well under the $10,000 limit - before trying to board a plane to Qatar on Sunday, according to court papers. He is now in jail 

Altareb is currently sitting in jail after he was held without bail at a Brooklyn federal court arraigment yesterday.

He will appear again today so his lawyer can propose a bail package.
