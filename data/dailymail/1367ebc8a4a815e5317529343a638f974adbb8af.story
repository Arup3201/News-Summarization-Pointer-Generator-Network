In an all-conquering Barcelona team full of Rolls-Royce midfielders and Ferrari forwards, being given the nickname ‘snowplough’ by Xavi could easily have been taken the wrong way, but Sergio Busquets is happy to accept it as a compliment.

He’s been clearing all before him and creating the space so that others can play their football since his first-team debut under Pep Guardiola in 2008.

Tuesday night’s Champions League game at the Etihad is a reminder of how Busquets played so well in his first season that Barcelona decided they didn’t need Yaya Toure and let him go to Manchester City for £24million.

At just 26, Sergio Busquets has already won 18 trophies: one World Cup, one European Championship, two Champions Leagues, four league titles and 10 other club cups.

It also brings Busquets face to face with Spain team-mate David Silva, whom he doesn’t hesitate to identify as City’s greatest threat.

‘When they have to create danger they create a lot of danger, especially when the ball reaches Silva,’ he says. ‘He has that freedom of movement within the side and he uses it very well. He can really cause you problems and he has that final pass too.’

The two will be at close quarters on Tuesday night, with Silva trying to dominate the space in front of the Barcelona defence that Busquets has patrolled so well these last seven years.

‘You are right in the middle of things and so to a certain extent you have to control everything,’ he says, describing an art that seems lost to English football — who was our last great defensive midfielder?

‘You are there for the centre backs but also for the forwards because it’s your responsibility to bring the ball out. And defensively, positioning is everything. More than stopping the counter-attack when it happens you want to prevent it from starting. It’s more about being tactically astute than physically dominant. You need to know exactly where to be on the pitch at all times.’

When Busquets first took over from Toure in the centre of Barca’s three-man midfield he looked ponderous in possession but critics soon noticed he never lost the ball.

‘It can appear that I have waited too long to play the pass, but I’m just waiting to see if the options will change, they usually do,’ he says. ‘I play the way I am as a person. I don’t panic, I’m patient.’

He had to be patient as a kid because there were no early signs of excellence and he certainly wasn’t fast-tracked through Barcelona’s La Masia academy. At least he never had a problem finding someone to go in goal during the kickabouts in his back yard.

‘We had a goalkeeper at home and we always wanted to take shots at him,’ he says of father Carlos, who was Barca’s first-choice keeper from 1994 to 1996.

His first hero was Luis Figo and he was at the Nou Camp the night the Portuguese was thrown a pig’s head for having joined Real Madrid. ‘I was disappointed when he left the club. Then you grow up and become a player and you look at it differently. Everyone has to be in charge of their own destiny. You play where you want to play.’

That is also how he sees Toure’s switch to City, saying: ‘People were surprised we had sold one of the best players in his position in the world but it wasn’t just about the club wanting to sell. He decided to leave. He could have stayed.’

He doesn’t see Toure’s departure as a ‘personal victory’ but it’s difficult not to interpret it that way. Guardiola rubber-stamped the sale because he believed in the 20-year-old he first coached in the youth team.

‘For him to have been my first manager . . . it is impossible to better that,’ he says. ‘We see football the same way. He is the best I’ve had, and probably ever will have.’

Busquets began the 2008-09 season in the youth team playing away at Santa Eulalia in front of 1,500 spectators but he finished it in Rome’s Olympic Stadium, beating Manchester United 2-0 in the Champions League final.

Was it just a case of playing the same way he had under Pep for the youth team? ‘You try to, but there is no escaping how different things are,’ he says. ‘In the fourth tier of Spanish football the pitches are small, the football is direct, and I wasn’t sat in the dressing room between the best midfield players in the world, Xavi and (Andres) Iniesta.’

With those three at the heart of the team Barca kept getting better and it is the Wembley final two years later, when they beat Manchester United 3-1, that he says marked their peak.

‘If you compare the two finals – the second was much better. We were more mature, stronger, and clearer about what we were trying to do.’

So can he make it to a third final? That will mean getting past Manchester City over two legs for the second season running.

Saturday’s shock 1-0 defeat by Malaga, ending a run of 11 straight wins, was not the best preparation but he is not about to let one defeat crush their confidence and he believes City’s open style could suit Barcelona.

‘Malaga got their goal and then defended in numbers with two banks of four and it was almost impossible to attack them. City will want to play and they will be more open,’ Busquets says.

‘The team have reached this stage of the season in good shape physically. We have the best player in the world in Messi, and we have (Luis) Suarez and Neymar.’

Suarez 'gives us so much' according to Busquets of his team-mate who joined Barcelona in the summer

Busquets has taken to Suarez: ‘He gives us so much,’ he says. ‘The numbers at the moment are not the same as they were at Liverpool but the way Barca play is not the way Liverpool play, he is not the player receiving the final pass as often.’

He believes Suarez’s off-the-ball running has opened up spaces for Messi and Neymar. ‘And it is not just the other two forwards who have benefited, but the whole team,’ he says. He also believes Suarez’s willingness to accept that Messi has to be numero uno has helped him settle.

‘Most of us understand that our reference is Leo. He is the one that makes the difference. He is the one who gives us something that other players can’t. And it is important for new players to know that and not let it affect them.’

The two players have spoken about the Premier League and although Barcelona are hopeful he will soon sign a contract extension until 2020 Busquets sounds tempted by the idea of playing in England at some point.

‘Perhaps when you play the same style of football for many years you can tire of it and the football in England is very different,’ he says. ‘I can’t say I’ll definitely play there because I’ve always said that I want to be here for many years but I would like to experience the Premier League one day.’

There would be no shortage of coaches coveting his services if he did switch — he has always been a ‘manager’s player’. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque once said that if he could come back again as any player, he’d ‘come back as Busquets’.

That begs the question which player would he be if he could choose? Surely not the ‘snowplough’ who clears the way for the others to play, the guy who never gets the glory?

Don’t count on it. ‘It’s not easy being Messi,’ Busquets says. ‘Let the strikers get the praise. I don’t think I would change anything. I think I would just be me.’
