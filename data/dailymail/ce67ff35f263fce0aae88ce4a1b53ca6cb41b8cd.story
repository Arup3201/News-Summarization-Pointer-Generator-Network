The terror warlord who has declared himself leader of the Muslim world, but was criticsed for wearing an expensive-looking wristwatch, may have instead been wearing a more modest item designed to predict prayer times.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State - known formerly as ISIS - recently declared himself leader of a Muslim caliphate and launched a scathing attack on the West.

But his fearsome address - in which he demanded loyalty from the world's 1.2billion Muslims and hailed 'long years of jihad' - was undermined by his outfit.

Public address: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was mocked for demanding loyalty from Muslims worldwide while sporting a flashy watch

Zoom: Some speculated online that it was a Rolex or Omega piece costing thousands of pounds

Though he wore traditional black robes and a turban for his sermon in the captured city of Mosul, he could also be seen sporting a bulky, silver wrist watch.

Viewers of his video quickly latched on to the incongruous piece of jewellery, suggesting that it could be a Rolex, Sekonda or a £3,500 Omega Seamaster - trappings of the Western world he despises.

But today Islamist supporters of the caliph hit back, saying that his watch is in fact a Al-Fajr WA-10S Deluxe watch, which can predict calls to prayer worldwide, according to the Telegraph.

It has not been confirmed whether the watch is the exact model he wears, but if it were it would offer Al-Baghdadi features including a compass pointing to Mecca and the option to set the date by the Gregorian calendar or a Muslim equivalent.

Social media posts from on user explained: 'Al-Fajr watches are really good - It beebs when it's Salah (prayer) time. Alhamdulilah! The Shaykh has good taste.'

Another added: 'I want this!!! N i want his black turban too.!'

The public appearance - a rarity for the leader dubbed 'the invisible Sheikh' - seemed to be an attempt to mimic Muslim leaders of 1,000 years ago, when Islamic empires ruled huge, unified tracts of the world.

Described
 as the world’s most wanted man, militants operating under Baghdadi’s 
control have spread terror through Syria and Iraq in an attempt to form a
 new Islamic state in the Middle East.

The
 Sunni fighters, responsible for the brutal slaughter of thousands, have
 vowed to expand the so-called caliphate to huge swathes of Europe and 
Africa.

Alternative: Despite the criticism some have claimed it is in fact a pious Islamic model

Video footage of 
Baghdadi, who has garnered the nickname ‘the invisible sheikh’ due to 
his elusive nature, emerged online on Friday and was quickly spread by 
jihadi websites.

Fighters 
from the group – previously known as ISIS - were among those who joined a
 packed congregation at the Great Mosque in Mosul, Iraq’s second largest
 city, as he delivered the 21-minute speech.

Referring
 to himself as ‘the leader who presides over you’, Baghdadi said that he
 could return the Muslim world to ‘dignity, might, rights and 
leadership.’

He said: ‘I am 
the wali (leader) who presides over you, though I am not the best of 
you, so if you see that I am right, assist me.’

‘I am not better than you or more virtuous than you,’ he added.

People were quick to spot the watch being worn by al-Baghdadi as he conducted the 20-minute sermon

Another asked on Twitter what make watch the Caliph was wearing during the video

He
 also used the sermon to praise his army of fighters, who have taken 
control of Mosul only one month before, and called for the strict 
interpretation of Islamic law.

‘God
 gave your mujahedeen brothers victory after long years of jihad and 
patience... so they declared the caliphate and placed the caliph in 
charge,’ he said.

‘This is a duty on Muslims that has been lost for centuries.’

The supposition that the wristwatch was an expensive Omega model was particularly embarrassing given that it seemed to contradict the content of his speech.

The Seamaster in particular has been styled a 'James Bond' watch in honour of the long-standing association of the spy films with the model.

When Pierce Brosnan took over the role of James Bond in 1995 he wore the Omega Seamaster Quartz Professional in the movie GoldenEye.

In all later films, Brosnan wore an Omega Seamaster Professional Chronometer.

Daniel Craig, who starred in Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, also wears the Omega Seamaster.

The watch was formerly believed to be either a Rolex, Sekonda or £4,000 Omega Seamaster (pictured)

Only
 two images of Baghdadi – who was the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq - are 
thought to have existed before his appearance in the video.

Reports
 have claimed that the terror chief even insists on talking to his 
deputies wearing a mask in an effort to protect his identity.

Iraqi
 officials last night said they were still working to authenticate the 
video but it is understood initial investigations have concluded the 
preacher is Baghdadi.

The US offered £5.8million for information leading to his capture or death in 2011

The group is thought to be made up of 11,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria and 3,000 foreign jihadis, including 500 Britons.
