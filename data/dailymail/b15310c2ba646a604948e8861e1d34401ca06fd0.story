Mesut Ozil is still on a high from winning the World Cup, and has been making pals with stars of other sports.

The German playmaker is in Las Vegas on holiday ahead of linking back up with Arsenal for pre-season training after his gruelling World Cup campaign.

And he found time to meet NBA stars Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose and Damian Lillard at the USA's training camp ahead of the basketball World Cup in Spain later this month.

Ozil posted a snap with Chigaco Bulls point guard Rose with the message 'Great moment! #derrickrose #nba #king'

He described meeting the USA squad as a 'pleasure' and even practiced his own jump shot before leaving the players to continue their preparations.

Ozil will be looking for Arsenal to make an assault on the Premier League title, but Rose has even more to prove this NBA season, being on the road to recovery following a lengthy injury lay-off.

Ozil however will not be in action for the start of the new season.

Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said: 'I have given them (Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker) a good break because I have experience of players who have been in the World Cup final. You need a rest.

'Will they be ready? Mertesacker prepares well - but for the first game I don't think they will be ready for August 16.'
