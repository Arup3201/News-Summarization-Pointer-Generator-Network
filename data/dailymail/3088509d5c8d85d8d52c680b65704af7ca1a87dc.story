You can already rent someone else’s home, and even get a stranger to cook you a three-course meal, but now the latest initiative is to borrow other people’s cars.

The service, called Getaround, connects car owners in cities across the US with drivers who need short-term rentals.

Typically, prices start at $10 (£6) an hour and every journey is covered by insurance and roadside assistance.
