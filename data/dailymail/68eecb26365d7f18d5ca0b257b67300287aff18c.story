 The two Philadelphia transit officers who delivered a baby boy in a train carriage on Christmas day have gone to visit the mother in hospital and the little boy they brought into the world.  

SEPTA Police Sgt. Daniel Caban and Officer Darrell James responded to a call around 5.50pm on Thursday and when they climbed on the train, they could already see the baby's head, they said.

A group of riders had formed a circle around the mother to give her some privacy as she went into labor on the Market-Frankford Line, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 

The officers, who both have children of their own, donned their gloves and Caban knelt down to catch the baby boy as he was born at the 15th Street station.

The officers, who both have children of their own, went to visit the mother and baby - who are both healthy - at Hahnemann Hospital on Friday morning. 

During the visit, the mom, Yanjin Li, told the officers she had decided to call the little boy Chris, considering he was born on Christmas, according to NBC Philadelphia.

It was a happy reunion for all involved, considering the last time they had seen each other, the officers were scrambling for a sweater to wrap little Chris in following the impromptu birth.

They found a generous passenger, wrapped up the baby, and then put him into his mother's arms for the first time.   

'The mother was at peace with the baby,' Caban told the Inquirer. 

The youngster's umbilical cord was slightly tangled around his neck, but they were able to free him.

Apart from that it was a healthy birth.

An ambulance took the two to hospital. 

Surveillance footage taken inside the carriage showed a medic smiling as he held the healthy newborn.

'It was such a joy to see a baby born on a train, you're not expecting that,' passenger Loreta McNeil told ABC6.

Healthy: The tot was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital and he and his mother are doing well

The officers said they had been looking forward to a quiet shift before heading home to their families but they were more than happy to help the couple.

'It was the best Christmas gift that I would ever be able to ask for,' said James, who has three kids with another on the way. 'Having a kid born on Christmas but also being able to help a family.'

'I was hoping for a quiet day, but this is worth it,' Caban told CBS. 'This is what our job about.'

He added: 'I had already opened all my presents I didn't know I had another one waiting for me around 5:53 this afternoon.'

SEPTA Police Chief Thomas Nestel III later tweeted his congratulations.

'Transit Police SGT and PO deliver baby on Market Frankford El train!!!! WOOHOO!!! Now that's a Christmas gift!!!' he wrote.

In a later tweet, he added: 'For those that have asked, I have waived today's fare for our newest rider.'

Many passengers on the train started filming and taking photos of the scene, such as local musician Sunny Ali, who posted a detailed photo of the birth to his Instagram.
