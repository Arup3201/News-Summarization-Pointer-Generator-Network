The South Australian Supreme Court will today hear submissions about legal action a popular Australian Instagram personality is taking against a YouTube 'diet guru' famous for eating up to 51 bananas a day.

Adelaide personal trainer Kayla Itsines, 23, her partner Tobias Pearce and company Bikini Body Training Company Pty Ltd last month launched an injunction against Freelee the Banana Girl (Leanne Ratcliffe) and Durianrider (Harley Johnstone) over remarks Ms Itsines alleged were defamatory.

Ms Itsines, 23, is behind the program Bikini Body Guide and has more than 2.3 million followers on Instagram. Freelee and Durianrider describe themselves as being behind the 'busiest raw vegan and vegan' website online, 30bananasaday, and post to a YouTube account with more than 330,000 subscribers. 

The vegan pair last week published a video of themselves and their bikes out the front of the Supreme Court building in Adelaide's Victoria Square, requesting their fans - 'fruit bats' - flock to the hearing in support. 'The fruit bats will prevail,' Freelee said.

Last month, Ms Itsines penned a fiery Facebook post addressed to her 1.3 million followers where she said she was taking action because of 'false claims that my partner takes steroids, claims I'm starving myself or other people, claims that I promote anorexia, for abusing the respect of my followers, my family and myself, claims I am starving people, claims I am a fraud.'

'This is wrong and illegal. So I have requested that the content be removed from the internet. After my initial request was denied I had no choice but to continue to protect the safety and reputation of my followers, Tobi and myself from a personal point of view.' 

Ms Itsines continued by saying she was 'standing up for myself, friends and family'. 'Statements have been made about me personally and my partner, Tobi, that are defamatory, misleading and deceptive.

'I welcome competition and freedom of choice. But I do not tolerate the promotion of rude, nasty and hurtful information that is false. I've always been one to protect my friends and family and that includes you girls. ‪#‎kaylasarmy‬.' 

'I refuse to watch the people around me suffer. I got into the health and fitness industry to help people.' 

Freelee and Durianrider then uploaded two video messages to their YouTube account calling on Ms Itsines to cease her legal action against them.

'We spoke up and shared our nutritional opinion online and YouTube or Instagram and we're getting taken to court for that,' Durianrider said in one video. 'It's out-f***ing-rageous'. 

'It's really disappointing too,' Freelee said: 'We just want to help people, we want to help girls all around the world'. 

The hearing will be held from 2:30pm Tuesday AEDT.
