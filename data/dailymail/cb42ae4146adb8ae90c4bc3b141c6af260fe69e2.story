The founder of clothing giant Boden was shocked when his dog discovered human remains during a walk in the park.

Johnnie Boden, whose label is a favourite with middle-class parents and celebrities such as Michelle Obama and Angelina Jolie, made the grisly find after his terrier, Sprout, bounded into undergrowth while the pair were out for a stroll near Wormwood Scrubs jail, West London.

When the dog failed to reappear after several minutes, the 51-year-old Old  Etonian scrambled through the thick scrub at Wormwood Scrubs Park in Acton, where he discovered a human skull, a pair of boots, and clothes.

Police immediately cordoned off the area and are awaiting the results of DNA tests to establish the identity of the body.

Mr Boden, who set up the clothing firm more than 20 years ago and counts David Cameron and Nick Clegg as clients, said: ‘Sprout shot off and disappeared into the undergrowth.  I thought there must have been a fox or a badger nearby and I stood by the scrub calling for Sproutie, but she wouldn’t come out.

'When she failed to emerge, I had to plunge into the heath and scramble through it in search of her.

‘I was like Harrison Ford – my arms were cut to pieces. I made my way through this almost impenetrable scrub and then I saw a single deserted boot. It was a Timberland walking boot, of quite recent vintage.

‘In the next split-second I looked 
down and saw an anorak, a pair of high-tech  performance trousers and a 
skull with hair still on it.

‘It
was odd because there was no flesh but the clothing appeared to be 
quite new. I was still standing there when Sprout reappeared – it sent a
shiver down my spine.

‘My
main reaction was one of sadness, that someone had died there. What an 
end. I called the police and they came in great numbers. Helicopters 
were buzzing round and round, and officers on the ground  cordoned off 
the scene.’

Mr Boden, whose firm sells £250 million of clothes a year, added: ‘I was rather late for a meeting at Boden but I was able to excuse myself by saying, “I’m terribly sorry I’m late, but my dog found a dead body near Wormwood Scrubs.” I have to say I regard it as one of my best lines.

‘When I went back a few days later the area was still cordoned off. I do hope  the police find out who it is and are able to get in touch with the family.’

Locals said the spot where the remains were found on January 30 was popular with homeless people. Several empty cans of Polish lager were found at the scene, as well as supermarket pallets that appeared to have been used for makeshift seating.

Retail worker Emily Salmon, 45, who lives next to the park and walks her dog there, said: ‘I saw a white police tent at  the spot and there were lots of officers in the area. It’s scary to think a body has been found right next to where we live.

‘I’ve often seen homeless people who sit there and drink, and it’s a place I would not walk my dog late at night.’

A spokesman for Scotland Yard confirmed human remains had been found at the park on January 30 and said officers were awaiting the results of DNA tests to establish the identity of the victim.

Police are not treating the death as suspicious.
