President Barack Obama praised Sony Pictures on Tuesday after learning that it had changed course and decided to release The Interview on Christmas Day after all.

'The president applauds Sony’s decision to authorize screenings of the film,' a spokesman for the president told reporters.

'As the president made clear, we are a country that believes in free speech, and the right of artistic expression,' spokesman Eric Schultz said. 'The decision made by Sony and participating theaters allows people to make their own choices about the film, and we welcome that outcome.'

The about face by Sony, which had cancelled the film's debut after terrorists threatened to attack theaters that showed it, follows a massive national outcry for the movie studio not to give in to agitators' demands. 

One Republican politician had even requested that the White House screen the film so that members of Congress could at least see it so that America did not look weak among its enemies. 

President Barack Obama said through a spokesman today that he welcomes Sony's decision to release the Interview as planned on Christmas Day

The film's maker, Sony Pictures, was refusing to honor a Thursday release of the movie after cyber hackers threatened to attack theaters that showed it but made an about face today

In a letter to Obama to Louisiana Sen. David Vitter requested that the Commander in Chief hold a special viewing of The Interview on Jan. 5, the day after he returns from his 17-day vacation to Hawaii.

The event should also include a 'serious discussion of the strong, substantive retaliatory measures' that the United States plans to inflict on North Korea for its actions, Vitter said.

Likewise, Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman was lobbying Sony to allow the movie, starring James Franco and Seth Rogen, to be shown at the U.S. Capitol for educational purposes and so that Members of Congress can show their solidarity with the motion picture industry.

Sony's decision to pull the film was preceded by a cyber hack on its computers by North Korea. Cyber terrorists then warned of 9/11 style attacks if the the film, which depicts the fake assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, were distributed as planned, leading major theater chains to back away from showing it.

President Obama had reprimanded Sony last week for giving into the attackers demands and warned that such appeasements set a bad precedent.

'We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States,' Obama told reporters at his year-end press conference.

'Let’s not get into that way of doing business,' he later said.

He also promised to take retaliatory action against North Korea for hacking Sony's computers and exposing embarrassing emails and sensitive employee information. He did not go into detail about what kind of actions he was considering, however.

'We will respond proportionally, and we’ll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. It’s not something that I will announce here today at a press conference,' he said.

The White House did not rule out its own screening of the film at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue when asked about the prospect by reporters last week, but White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest pointed to the president's vacation and said, 'I don't think we're going to be showing the film here anytime soon.'

At his news conference the following day Obama wouldn't say if he planned to hold a viewing or watch the film himself as a symbolic gesture.

'I’ve got a long list of movies I’m going to be watching,' he said referring to his holiday plans.

He added moments later, 'I never release my full movie list.'

That's not to say that other White House and government officials haven't seen the film though, the White House said last week.

'Administration officials were consulted about the film prior to its release, at the request of the company that was producing it,' Earnest told reporter. 'Input was shared.'

On Tuesday Sony Pictures Entertainment announced a limited theatrical release of the movie, with the company's CEO Michael Lynton saying in a statement, 'We have never given up on releasing The Interview.'

'While we hope this is only the first step of the film's release, we are proud to make it available to the public and to have stood up to those who attempted to suppress free speech,' he said.

Sony said it had received commitments roughly 200 theaters across America to show the movie beginning on Thursday.

Politicians from both major political parties had been encouraging Sony to make the film available to the greater population so that Americans might come to their own conclusions about the movie.

'Dear @SonyPictures - please make #TheInterviewMovie available in DVD so I can decide whether to see it, not N. Korea,' Democratic Rep. Steve Israel of New York tweeted.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus sent Sony a letter pledging the GOP's full support behind showings of the film and even promised to send a note to the 'Republican Party's millions of donors and supporters urging them to buy a ticket -- not to support one movie or Hollywood, but to show North Korea we cannot be bullied into giving up our freedom.' 

Even if the film is not distributed en masse, yet, lawmakers on Capitol Hill say they'd at least like to be able to see it so they can better understand why North Korea would go to such great lengths to to keep it under wraps.

'Threats from a dictator in North Korea should not stop Americans from seeing any movie. We have a responsibility to stand up against these attempts at intimidation,' California's Sherman wrote in a letter to Sony.

'This is also about educating Members of Congress. Everyone is talking about The Interview,' he continued. 'I think it’s important for Congress to know, and see, what we are talking about.'

Sherman went on to explain that in watching the film Congress will demonstrate to the world its 'support of the freedom of speech.'

'This is about our right to live without fear, and knowing that our values will not be compromised by the idle threats of a despotic regime,' he said. 'Good or bad, Americans should not be deprived of the opportunity to see this movie.'

The Democratic Congressman said the federal government has a responsibility 'to allocate the necessary resources to ensure moviegoers’ safety' if Sony Pictures decides to send the film to theaters nationwide after all and that its up to Congress to help 'moviegoers regain the confidence to go see The Interview.'

In the letter to Obama requesting a White House showing, Louisiana Sen. Vitter pressured the president to take 'strong action' against North Korea to show that the U.S. cannot be coerced into submission.

'The policy of rewarding terrorists, authoritarianism, and cruelty with concessions should not be the legacy we pursue,' he said.

Echoing Obama's own words during his news conference last Friday, Vitter argued that 'North Korea and other rogue actors are likely to be emboldened' by recent events. 

Vitter argued that Obama needs to take these steps to counteract his administration's 'past weak policies, which have irreversible outcomes,' which include the the May exchange of five Taliban commanders for missing soldier Sgt. Bowe Berghdahl and last week's release of five Cuban spies in a swap for political prisoners of Raul Castro's regime.

'A strong message needs to be delivered to reassure the American people and U.S. businesses that we will not bend to the will of bad actors, whether they are hackers, terrorist, state-sponsors of terrorism, or nation states,' he said. 

'The actions of the American government must step up to demonstrate that rogue actors across the world will not be rewarded for bad behavior.'

The U.S may have already struck back at North Korea. Current internet outages across the country are rumored to be the result of a cyber attack carried out by the United States. 

The State Department would not confirm on Monday that the U.S. was behind the alleged cyber attack but its spokesperson hinted that it might be.
