Britain is to be investigated by the International Criminal Court over claims of war crimes by troops.

Prosecutors in the Hague have launched a 'preliminary examination' into allegations UK forces tortured and mistreated Iraqi prisoners between 2003 and 2008.

It is the first time the ICC, which usually prosecutes dictators who systematically maim and kill civilians, has investigated Britain for alleged war crimes.

It took the first step towards a 
formal investigation after studying more than 400 allegations of 
beating, sexual assault, mock executions and electric shocks of Iraqi 
captives.

The claims are made in a 250-page dossier compiled by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers.

It raises the prospect of soldiers, 
commanders and politicians, including four former Labour defence 
secretaries – Geoff Hoon, John Reid, Des Browne and John Hutton – who 
are named in the file being put on trial for war crimes.

The move provoked anger among ministers and the military.

Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded UK
 forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘Public Interest Lawyers, intent on 
discrediting the Armed Forces, are slinging mud in every direction in 
the desperate hope that some will stick.

‘The ICC performs a valuable role in 
bringing war criminals to book from dictatorships that will not 
prosecute them. That does not apply to the UK, which has the 
oldest-established and most highly respected legal system in the world.’

Last night Attorney General Dominic 
Grieve said the UK would co-operate fully but that the Government 
‘completely rejected’ the claim that UK forces were responsible for 
systematic abuse.

The ICC first looked at allegations 
of abuse in Iraq in 2006, but decided that an investigation was not 
needed because the claims were not serious or widespread enough.

In a statement, prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said she would review 'new information' she received in January alleging that British officials bear responsibility for wrongdoing

Yesterday ICC prosecutor Fatou 
Bensouda said an examination was being opened after ‘new information’ 
that the UK was involved in alleged systematic abuse of detainees was 
received.

Mr Grieve said he believed the ICC 
would decide there was no need for it to carry out a full investigation 
because Britain is already investigating claims of abuse in Iraq.

One inquiry collapsed in March when 
lawyers admitted there was no evidence to support Iraqi claims that 
troops murdered prisoners and mutilated their bodies following a battle 
in 2004.

The Iraq Historic Allegations Team, 
led by former civilian detectives, is currently dealing with a further 
52 allegations of unlawful killing by British forces and 93 allegations 
of mistreatment following the toppling of Saddam Hussein.

The ICC could take several years to 
decide whether to take its inquiry further but under its statute can 
intervene only when a nation is carrying out no effective investigation.

The 
Director of Service Prosecutions Andrew Cayley QC - who is responsible 
for prosecutions of service personnel - said the UK would co-operate 
fully with the preliminary examination by the prosecutor.

He
 said was confident that the case would not move to a formal 
investigation as the UK was already conducting its own inquiry through 
the Iraq Historical Allegations Team (IHAT) established in 2010.

Under the Statute of Rome which established the ICC, the court can only intervene in cases where there is no effective investigation by the national authorities.

'If the ICC is satisfied that the United Kingdom is genuinely investigating these crimes, they will allow us to do that.

'They may go on monitoring us for a number years in respect of investigations and prosecutions but they will not intervene,' he said.

'Of course in the end it is for the prosecutor of the ICC to determine this, but I am confident based on the work that I've seen that IHAT has been doing, that the court will find that these are genuine criminal investigations that are taking place and they won't take it any further.'

The 
preliminary examination was launched in response to a 250-page dossier 
submitted to the prosecutors office in January by the British law firm, 
Public Interest Lawyers, and the European Centre for Constitutional and 
Human Rights - a German human rights organisation.

Former defence secretary Geoff Hoon and former armed forces minister Adam Ingram are among those named in the file.

The
 prosecutor's office will now study the dossier alongside submissions 
from the British Government and other relevant bodies - a process that 
could take several years before a final decision is taken on whether to 
move to a full investigation.

'The preliminary examination is the first step in a process,' Mr Cayley said.

'The preliminary examinations can carry on for a very lengthy period. there have been preliminary examinations going on for years.'

The IHAT, led by a former civilian police detective, is looking into 53 cases of alleged unlawful killing and a further 93 cases of alleged mistreatment.

Today's announcement follows the news in March that a legal firm took £2.5 million in taxpayers money from a public inquiry into the deaths of Iraqi men - even though the investigation's key claim has now been abandoned due to a lack of evidence.

Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers represented the relatives of more than 20 Iraqis who claimed the men were taken prisoner by British soldiers, and later mistreated and murdered.

Despite the relatives withdrawing their claims last week, the Al-Sweady Public Inquiry confirmed that it has spent more than £22million of public money on the investigation - including handing £2.5million over to Public Interest Lawyers run by the 'committed socialist' solicitor Phil Shiner.

A spokesperson for the Al-Sweady Public Inquiry told MailOnline: 'The 
£2.5 million has all gone to PIL [Public Interest Lawyers] but that’s 
not just legal costs. It’s also the cost for witnesses: expenses for 
witnesses to come over from Iraq and to hear some of them via video link
 from overseas.'

It is 
understood that the money received by Public Interest Lawyers included 
covering the cost of flying and accommodating 15 key witnesses in 
Britain, as the Al-Sweady Inquiry's chairman Sir Thayne Forbes wanted to
 see them face-to-face.

It
 also included the building of - and transport to and from - a 'small 
studio' close to Iraq from which an additional 40 family members of the 
deceased gave evidence.

As Public Interest Lawyers were the only 
legal firm working with the Al-Sweady Inquiry, all the expenses of 
gathering evidence from witnesses went through them the spokesperson said.

Public
 Interest Lawyers is currently acting for more than 100 clients who 
claim their relatives were unlawfully detained, ill-treated, or killed 
by UK forces in Iraq.

It has
 secured more than £3million in payouts, most notably, representing the 
family of Baha Mousa - the hotel receptionist who died in 2003 in 
custody in Iraq. The subsequent inquiry cost £13million.

Responding
 to claims that Public Interest Lawyers earned, as opposed to received 
£2.5million from the inquiry, Phil Shiner said: 'The amount of costs PIL
 has received from the MoD [not Legal Aid!] for that issue is less than 
£70,000.'

In the same month the primary strand of the Al-Sweady Inquiry effectively fell apart when relatives admitted there was no hard evidence to suggest the insurgents were unlawfully killed in UK custody.

In a statement released as evidence drew to a close, Public Interest Lawyers accepted the men were killed during a ferocious firefight, dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, near Basra in 2004.

They admitted no evidence had been produced to suggest the men had been murdered unlawfully.

The extraordinary concession provoked outrage that British troops accused of the most serious crime have had their names 'dragged through the mud' by publicly-funded lawyers.
