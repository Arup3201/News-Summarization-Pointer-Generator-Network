A woman who struggled with obesity for almost 20 years has finally shed half her body weight - so that she will be around to watch her nephews grow up. 

And Canadian Alison Fox - who didn't go on dates until her mid-twenties because of her weight - finally got the confidence to take the leap after moving to UK and getting her first ever boyfriend, who was there to hold her hand as she joined a fit club.    

The 27 year old, who now lives in Nottingham, first considered trying to get fit after watching her beloved aunt, who had always been overweight, passed away at just 53 years old in 2009.

At her heaviest, Alison tipped the scales at 21 stone 2lbs. The death of an overweight aunt and the birth of two nephews made her want to overhaul her diet, but the 27-year-old didn't have the confidence until she met her first boyfriend 

But it wasn't until her youngest nephew was born in late 2012 that she finally mustered the courage to take the leap and go on a diet, after promising herself that she would live to see him live into adulthood.  

After joining WeightWatchers in 2013, she has lost more than ten stone, going from 21 stone 2lbs to her current weight of 10 stone 6lbs.

Alison has always struggled with her weight, from the age of nine she was teased at school in Ontario, Canada, and had to move schools when the bullying got too bad.

She spent her teenage years feeling down constantly, last to be picked for the school sports team and never asked out on dates. 

She lived within a destructive cycle - as her self-esteem plummeted and her weight continued to increase.

But Alison was given a wake-up call on her health in December 2009, when her aunt, who had always been overweight, passed away at just 53 years old. 

In 18 months, Alison has lost half her body weight and is now 10 stone 6lbs

Soon after, she became an aunt herself and was tormented with the idea that her weight could mean she never saw her nephew grow up. 

The shock wasn't enough though, and in 2011, a permanent move to the UK and the arrival of her first ever boyfriend saw her put on even more weight. 

Then in 2012, Alison's youngest nephew was born and on a Christmas trip back to her hometown of Ontario, she made a promise to herself to stay healthy for her nephews so that she can be around as long as possible for them. 

On her return to the UK, her disgust at her body shape meant she couldn't even look back at the family photos taken on her holiday.

On March 9, 2013, she signed up to her local Weight Watchers meeting in Nottingham. 

After years of being bullied, Alison's fear of being mocked for her size left her unable to enter the room - but it was her boyfriend's promise to stay by her side and hold her hand through the ordeal that helped her to go through the first meeting. 

Alison loves her new active lifestyle after losing the weight. She said: 'I have bags more energy, I never hit the 2pm slump I always used to hit during the day and can easily climb numerous flights of stairs without getting out of breath' 

She has attended a weekly meeting ever since and last week, reached her goal weight of 10 stone 7lbs.  

Alison said: 'Losing weight has changed my life, I’m so much more confident and able to assert myself more. 

'It makes me sad to think that I was this under confident, overweight girl for so long, I wish I’d done it sooner. 

'I have bags more energy, I never hit the 2pm slump I always used to hit during the day and can easily climb numerous flights of stairs without getting out of breath.

'Each time I return home to Canada, my family don’t recognise me – they can’t believe how far I’ve come. 

'The best thing of all is knowing that I can be there for my three young nephews and play games with them without getting out of breath. 

'It’s amazing to see the look on their faces when I jump and run around with them, my youngest nephew even commented: “You’re different, Aunt Alison”, and I really am! 

'When I reached goal yesterday my family were there with me in the meeting via Skype on my phone – they can’t believe it’s me on the other end of the screen.'
