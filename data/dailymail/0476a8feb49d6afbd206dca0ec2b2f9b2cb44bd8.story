The final day of a Chinese May Day holiday ended in terror for more than 20 people - including children and the elderly - after they fell into a river when a bamboo suspension bridge suddenly tilted.

About 40 revellers were returning from a bonfire party to celebrate International Workers' Day on Peach Blossom island in Fenghuang, central Hunan province at 9.20pm on Wednesday evening.

As they crowded onto the bridge at the popular tourist town, a loaded pile broke, causing a cable to snap and the bridge floor to tilt.

Twenty-four people then plunged into the fast-flowing water, which is about 1.2m deep.

This was the scene the morning after 24 people fell into a fast-flowing river when a bamboo suspension bridge suddenly tilted in Hunan province, China

A group of about 40 tourists - including children and the elderly - were returning from a bonfire party to celebrate International Workers' Day on Peach Blossom Island in Fenghuang on Wednesday evening

People wait on the riverbank after the incident, at 9.20pm. Fifteen tourists managed to swim to safety, while the others were all rescued

The county's deputy head, Cai Long, said 15 people managed to climb 
onto the river bank and the others were rescued, according to Xinhua news agency.

They were taken to hospital for examination, where two are being treated for minor injuries.

One witness said the party-goers had not rocked the bridge in excitement, contrary to earlier reports.

Instead, a town official urged them to cross it as soon as possible since the bridge was swaying at that time.

Yang Zhi, who runs the Boyazhai Hotel in the town, reckoned there were around 200 tourists on the bridge at the time it tilted.
