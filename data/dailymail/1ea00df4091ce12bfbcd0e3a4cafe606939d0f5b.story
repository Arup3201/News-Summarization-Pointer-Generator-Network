It might feel as if you are just one big bill away from bankruptcy, but a report published today shows that the average worker is actually ‘a millionaire’ - eventually.

If you start work at the age of 18, you will have earned a total of £1million by the age of 56 and a half as long as you do not take any career breaks, such as a period of unemployment.

But it usually takes much longer for women - age 70 as opposed to 51 for men - to have earned one million pounds.

'This time next year, we'll be millionaires': Del Boy (David Jason, centre) famously says to his brother Rodney Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst, right) in BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses that their luck will eventually turn

The report, from the insurance giant Prudential, says it is ‘entirely possible’ for most workers to hit the seven-figure landmark.

You do not even have to be a high earner, running a FTSE 100 company or coming up with the next idea for a Google, Apple or BT.

The calculations are based on the average salary for each age group from the official earnings figures published by the Office for National Statistics. It assumes that you earn the average salary for your age group at all times.

For example, you are earning £9,317 a year between the age of 18 and 21, £20,439 between the age of 22 and 29 rising to a peak of £31,312 in your 40s.

But today’s report does highlight the huge gulf between the amount of money that men earn, compared to the amount that their female colleagues earn.

In many cases, the two are doing exactly the same job – but the man is just paid more money to do it.

On average, a man will have ‘earned his first million’ by the age of 51. But a woman does not reach the landmark until she is 70 because her earnings tend to be so much lower.

The shocking 19-year wait faced by women is entirely due to the fact that their salaries tend to be so much lower than men’s salaries.

'Being a millionaire is a dream for most of us. But the reality is that the average UK employee will easily earn £1million in a lifetime of work'

Stan Russell, Prudential

In his 40s, a man’s earnings usually peak, with an average salary of £40,246. By comparison, a woman in the same age group is earning only £22,275.

Even when a woman’s earnings peak in her 30s, her salary is only £23,075.

Stan Russell, a retirement expert at the Prudential, said: ‘Being a millionaire is a dream for most of us. But the reality is that the average UK employee will easily earn £1million in a lifetime of work.’

While they might have earned £1million, they do not actually get to spend this amount of money.

By the time the average worker has earned their first million, they will have paid approximately £123,300 in tax and £93,200 in National Insurance, a total of £216,500.
