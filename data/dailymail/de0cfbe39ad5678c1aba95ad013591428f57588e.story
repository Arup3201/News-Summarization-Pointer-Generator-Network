Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has expressed his joy at Bill Roache's acquittal today as ITV revealed the pair will be back on Coronation Street together within months.

The 49-year-old, who has played mechanic Kevin Webster for decades, was himself cleared of child sex offences after a trial at Manchester Crown Court last September.

Mr Le Vell said today 'I'm delighted for him' as it emerged that Roache had been acquitted of rape and indecent assault of five women.

Happy: Bill Roache waves to crowds today after he was cleared of child sex offences today and has received huge support from fellow Coronation Street stars today, including Michael Le Vell, who face trial last year

Bill Roache last appeared in May 2013 with no explanation given for his 
absence until two months later when viewers were told he had left to care for his grandson in Canada.

ITV said after today's verdicts it was 'looking forward 
to talking to Bill soon about his return to work', with sources saying it could only be a matter of months until he is back.

After his arrest scriptwriters explained 
away Le Vell's absence by saying his character was in Germany visiting 
his father, but he will return to the screen full time this spring.

Friends and colleagues of Mr Roache have expressed their 
relief and support after the actor was cleared of abuse charges - and 
looked forward to his return to TV.

Beverley Callard, known for her 
frequent appearances as the Street's Liz McDonald, said: 'Ken, there's a
 pint waiting for you in The Rovers. Love ya.'

Actor Antony Cotton, the programme's Sean Tully said: 'The truth will always out.'

A former Coronation Street actor said he was not even in the show in the year that one of William Roache's complainants recalled seeing him at Granada studios.

The woman said she remembered seeing Kenneth Cope, who played the character Jed Stone, pop his head in a dressing room where Roache was said to be talking to her and another schoolgirl in May 1965 after they took part in a children's talent show.

Mr Cope gave evidence for the defence in the trial at Preston Crown Court and said it could not have happened.

Speaking to Channel 5 News, he said: ‘There's a lot wrong with that because I wasn't in the show in May 65. I wasn't in the show that whole year, I would've had to have a hell of a long neck.

‘I've got an idea I was in Yugoslavia doing Genghis Khan on a horseback. I would've needed a long neck to open his door and look around it. You'd never do it anyway, it was just etiquette. You never went into anybody's dressing room.’

He continued: ‘I was very, very surprised because, basically, from what I knew about Bill, I didn't think he was capable of doing it, I didn't think it was true. He wouldn't have to.

‘Bill attracted all sorts of ladies, many ladies, he had the pick of grown-up women without having to resort to kiddies.’

Charlie
 Condou, who plays Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, wrote online: 'So 
glad and relieved the right verdict was reached. Look forward to seeing 
Bill back at work.'

Vicky Entwistle - the programme's Janice Battersby - said she and her husband Andrew Chapman were pleased with the verdict.

'Andy
 and I (are) elated to hear the wonderful news that William Roache has 
been cleared of all charges. We have a  very happy house,' she wrote on 
Twitter.

Kate Ford, who has played his on-screen stepdaughter Tracy Barlow for many years, said simply: 'Yay!'

Chris
 Bisson, known to viewers for his role as Vikram Desai, said he was 
'glad to hear that Bill Roache was cleared unanimously by the jury'.

And Bruno Langley (the show's Todd Grimshaw) said on Twitter: 'Go on Bill.'

Actor Ken Morley, who played Reg Holdsworth in the soap alongside him, said: 'Another waste of public money.

'Considering the Michael Le Vell farce, they should be careful about the waste of taxpayers money.

'My
 heart goes out to Bill. We all knew it was nonsense from the outset. It
 is part of the Jimmy Savile witch hunt - this all followed the demise 
of the repulsive DJ from Yorkshire.'

Sherrie Hewson, who played Maureen
 Webster and is a friend of Bill Roache said: 'It's made me really well 
up. It's just that we've all backed him for so long and I just thank God
 for this day.

'We all
 know Bill. We've worked with him, we know of his innocence and we knew 
right from the beginning - this should never ever have gone this far. 
and it's made me so cross'.

Supporter: Kym Marsh, who plays Michelle Connor on the Street, declared the verdict was 'justice' for her colleague

Backing: Bafta winner Daran Little, who wrote the soap for ten years, was one of many who tweeted support for Bill Roache

Tribute: Chris Bisson, who played Dev's cousin Vikram Desai, also welcomed the verdict

His Coronation Street family had backed him in court when called by the defence.

The
 court heard he was 'always a perfect gentleman' around his on-screen 
wife Anne Kirkbride during filming and the actress, who plays Deirdre 
Barlow, described Roache as 'lovely', adding that there was 'never a 
hint or suggestion' that he had behaved inappropriately on set.

Chris
 Gascoyne, 45, who has played Roache's on-screen son Peter Barlow since 
2000, told the court: 'It's been a joy to be with Bill.'

Asked to describe Roache's character, he said: 'Kind, warm, open, good sense of humour. Professional.'

Helen Worth, who plays Gail Platt, told the court she joined the Coronation Street cast in 1974, at the age of 23.

'He was caring. Never anything more. Just caring. What more can a man be? He was lovely,' she said.

She said she was 'extremely nervous' when she joined the show, but was soon made to feel welcome by everyone.

She added: 'Bill perhaps was caring more and welcoming to me then and has been to every new member of the cast since.'

Peter
 Baldwin, who played Derek Wilton for 21 years in the soap, added: ‘It 
is one person’s word against another after 50 years - it is dreadful 
that it comes to court.

‘I am glad for Bill and not at all surprised by the verdict. It is only because of the Savile case that these other cases are being brought.

'Ken, there's a pint waiting for you in The Rovers. Love ya'

Beverley Callard (Liz McDonald)

‘What was happening in those days was anybody on television had kids and girls throwing themselves at them. The groups and bands at the BBC had people queuing up at the dressing room doors.’

John Stevenson, a Street scriptwriter and friend of Roache for 40 years, said: ‘I am pleased for Bill and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty is something I believe in. 

‘I have known him for 40 years and have never heard or seen him doing anything crass or aggressive to anyone. He is the most mild-mannered and non-aggressive man you could wish to meet.’
