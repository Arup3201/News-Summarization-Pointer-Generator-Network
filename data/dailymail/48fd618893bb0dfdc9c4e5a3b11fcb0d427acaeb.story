Threats: A Falklands protest group have threatened to disrupt Princess Anne's visit to Argentina

A militant group has threatened Princess Anne as she begins a five-day visit to Argentina amid rising tensions over the Falklands.

The Princess Royal, in Buenos Aires in her role as president of the International Olympic Committee, is the first senior royal to undertake an official engagement in Argentina for 14 years.

Last night she was due to attend the opening ceremony of the 125th session of the IOC, which has the task of deciding the venue for the 2020 Games.

But Quebracho, an extreme Left-wing group that led protests against Prince William’s military role in the Falklands last year, has threatened to breach security, bringing chaos to proceedings.

Declaring that it is not going to let the ‘pirate princess swan around Argentina as if nothing had happened’, the group called on activists to descend on the Colon Theatre in Buenos Aires, where the IOC event was set to open last night.

In a statement it describes the princess as ‘Anne of England, sister of Charles, daughter of Elizabeth II, the Queen, who ordered the attack on the Falklands in 1982’.

It continues: ‘She “honours” us with her presence at the Colon Theatre. She comes here, and thinks that she can pass through Argentina as if nothing had ever happened.

‘But when she walks through the city, we will be there; and when she goes to the Colon Theatre, we will be waiting for her.

‘We Argentines are not going to let her swan around as if it were nothing to us.‘We want to remind her – her and her  family – that she is not welcome here … We Argentines do not forget. The Falklands are Argentinian and the English have to go. There is no alternative.’

Hatred: Protesters burn an effigy of Prince William outside the British embassy in Buenos Aires

The declaration was published on the group’s website next to an image of a Union Jack ablaze and refers to the last official visit by a royal to Argentina in 1999 when Prince Charles went to lay a wreath for the Argentinian war dead.

When Prince William was serving in the Falklands as an RAF helicopter rescue pilot last year the group sprayed graffiti on British banks saying ‘Get out of the Malvinas’.

The princess’s visit comes with president Cristina Kirchner of Argentina ratcheting  up anti-British rhetoric over the Falklands with back-up from Spain. Critics say she is trying to divert attention from the country’s economic woes.

A spokesman for the Princess Royal said: ‘We never comment on security arrangements or threats.’
