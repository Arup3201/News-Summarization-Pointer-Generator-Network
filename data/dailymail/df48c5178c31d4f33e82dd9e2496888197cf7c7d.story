Marks & Spencer is releasing an apple, pear and Brussel sprout-flavoured juice as part of its festive range

Want some colour in your cheeks? Hurry up and drink your sprouts.

The thought may make many go a bit green about the gills, but if you can’t stand Brussels sprouts on your plate at Christmas then how about trying them as a refreshing juice instead?

Marks & Spencer is to combine the much-maligned vegetable with apple and pear for a sweet and tasty drink that adds a healthy element to the usual festive binge.

The juice adds up to two of the five daily portions of fruit and vegetables that are recommended for a healthy diet.

Together with a sprout-based coleslaw, it is among many innovations that are being introduced by M&S for its festive food collection this year – not all of them for the more virtuous diner.

Following the successful launch of its Fish and Chip Pie, the chain will be selling an indulgent Christmas dinner in a pie this year – complete with turkey, stuffing, pigs in blankets and cranberry sauce.

And for those who want a bite-size version of Christmas, the party food range includes Christmas dinner on a stick.

A team of 40-strong product developers at M&S began working on the range in September last year and have flown to New York, Barcelona and Paris to find the latest trends and ingredients.

Innovative new products include a Christmas cake liqueur and an edible cheese board made from crackers.

There is also a gin flavoured with tea and dressed with gold flakes, which M&S is calling the G&Tea.

As an alternative to the traditional pudding, it has developed a Collection Bright Lights Christmas Cake, which comes trimmed with LED lights, and a Five Gold Rings decadent chocolate pudding.

The company’s food halls are a 
magnet for Middle Britain and the chain’s Christmas sales have continued
 to boom despite the six years of austerity that many have endured.

Sandra Ziles, the chain’s head of product development, said: ‘At Christmas we all want to wow our family and friends with delicious food and surprise them with interesting new discoveries.

‘We’ve spent nearly 18 months working on this year’s range and we’ve got something for everyone, from the most delicious turkey to Christmas cake liqueur and even the first edible cheese board.’

She added: ‘What could be a better taste of Christmas than Christmas cake liqueur? And for those willing to be a bit more adventurous you can’t beat our Brussels sprout juice – we hope it will convert a few non-sprout eaters to the green side.’
