It's normally women accused of high maintenance beauty routines and spending hours to get ready. But are men starting to taking over as the main bathroom hogs?

In a new interview, Peter Andre has revealed that although he takes just 15 minutes to get ready each morning, that's only after he's spent an hour or more indulging in a pampering regime.

'If I have to be somewhere in the morning, the actual getting ready takes 15 minutes,' Peter told The Guardian.

Role reversal? Peter Andre has revealed that his daily grooming and fashion routine sees him prepping for over an hour before he can leave the house

'But I need an hour before that to put on my steam shower, go downstairs and sit and have a coffee in silence.'

Peter's far from ready to walk out of the door after his morning beverage ritual however, which consists of a double espresso and glass of water, for both a caffeine and hydration boost.

Next, comes jumping in the steam shower he has preheated, before tackling his hair and skin.

He said: 'My hair is curly, so if I'm, going somewhere on my own, not a work event, I will run the straighteners over it. 

I also use coconut oil as a moisturiser. 

'You can do anything with it - eat it, cook with it, use it on your skin. It's fantastic.' 

Who hogs the bathroom in this house? Part of Peter's morning routine involves preheating his steam shower for an hour while he drinks a cup of coffee in silence. So when does fiancée Emily MacDonagh (right) get her turn?

Then, comes the agonising decision of what he's going to wear each day. Picking an outfit the night before just isn't an option for the popstar.

Instead, Peter needs to walk into his wardrobe and pick out clothes which match his mood for the day.

'I could pick out a million things the night before, but if I wake up and I don't feel as good as I did the day before, I won't want to wear any of it.' 

In contrast, British model and It girl Alexa Chung has said she can be up and out of the house in a mere seven minutes. 

British fashion icon Alexa Chung may give everyone style envy on the front row, but the model claims her daily 'getting ready' routine takes her a mere seven minutes. Pictured: Alexa Chung attends the Prada show during the Milan Fashion Week last month 

Talking to STAR magazine,the front row regular said, 'In real life, it's around the seven-minute mark. But for fashion week, I try and put in a bit more of an effort.'

For Alexa Chung however, more of an effort means just three minutes added to her normal routine.

Compared with Peter's painstaking grooming process, Alexa's final Fashion Week regime takes her a maximum of 10 minutes.

Fashion Week ready in 10 minutes or less? It girl Alexa claims that to get ready for big events like sitting front row at Fashion Week, she needs just an extra three minutes of preening time. Pictured: Alexa Chung attends the British Fashion Awards Nominees' Dinner in London last November
