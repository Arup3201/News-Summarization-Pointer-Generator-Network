A plucky little girl visiting Disney World in Orlando, Florida made it known to Gaston of Beauty and the Beast that there was absolutely no way he was going to be marrying Belle.

The girl, coincidentally named Isabella, was not impressed by Gaston's notorious charms and footage of her defiantly standing up for Belle awarded her over 200,000 views on YouTube after being posted on November 9.

'Belle is going to marry me today,' Gaston says to Isabella as he signs his autograph in one of her books. 

Standing her ground: Isabella isn't shy when it comes to telling Gaston he is not marrying Belle 

making her point: Isabella tells Gaston over and over again that The Beast is marrying Belle 

'No, No, No.,' she responds. ‘The Beast is marrying Belle!'

Onlookers can't help but laugh at this little girl's conviction for her favorite Disney character. Gaston's outlandish responses are also worth a chuckle .

'I don't know where this girl came from but somebody needs to put her back in the kitchen where she belongs right now,' he states proudly in attempt to mark his territory.

When the little girl goes to pose for a portrait with Gaston he tries to break her spirit once more and says, 'smile like you're making me a sandwich.'

'Now girl go do what you're supposed to do in life. And no more thinking for you.'

Isabella is unimpressed with his stereotypical insults and she pours salt on his wound once more.

'YOU'RE not marrying Belle,' she reminds him as she looks at him right in the eyes without flinching.

'You are never, ever, ever, ever!'

'Forever ever?,' he asks holding back tears.

Isabella then reminds him that the Beast is actually a prince, a very strong one at that.

'The Beast will fight with you,'she exclaims.

'I've been outdone by a girl. A short one,' he concludes admitting his defeat.

Setting him straight: Isabella tells Gaston he'd better be on his best behavior otherwise The Beast will fight

Conviction: In case he didn't hear her the first time, Isabella reminds Gaston he isn't going near Belle

Admitting defeat: Gaston finally admits to being a beat by a girl, although he points out she is rather short
