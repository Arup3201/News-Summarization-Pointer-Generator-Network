A massive world 2,500 times the size of Earth has been discovered by an international team of astronomers.

Named MOA-2011-BLG-322, the planet is around eight times the size of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.

Astronomers believe it orbits a star 25,000 light-years away and has a mass that is one third that of our sun.

The giant planet, reported by Ian O'Neill at Discovery News, was found using a technique known as ‘microlensing’.

Microlensing uses Albert Einstein’s theory of general relatively which suggests what we perceive as the force of gravity actually arises from the curvature of space and time.

Einstein believed that although Earth appears to be pulled towards the sun, it is in fact the shape of space-time around the sun that changes the way Earth moves.

Earth moves.

Microlensing 
makes use of this theory by measuring how the light of a distant star is
 intensified due to the gravitational field of a closer star.

According to Einstein’s theory, this is 
caused by bending of the surrounding space-time which makes the more 
distant star easier to discover by Earth observatories.

The transient brightening of MOA-2011-BLG-322 was seen in 2011 by astronomers in Japan, New Zealand, Poland and Israel.

Data from these observations suggest that giant world is likely to be an M-type- the most common type of star in space.

The planet is thought to have an orbital distance times four-times the Earth’s distance from the sun.

The research suggests that if such a massive planet can exist at that distance from its star, then current formation theories about planets may be incorrect.
