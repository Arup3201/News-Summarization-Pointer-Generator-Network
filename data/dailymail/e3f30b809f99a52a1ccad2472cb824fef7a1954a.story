Tahir Alam, Muslim Council of Britain activist, could now be removed from his post as Ofsted is expected to impose special measures on six Birmingham schools, three of which are run by him

Six secular schools at the centre of a plot to introduce hardline Islamic teaching into classrooms are to be placed in special measures.

It has been reported that Ofsted inspectors will rate the schools 'inadequate' after snap inspections this week, which usually leads to a school being placed in special measures, allowing officials to remove senior managers or close the school.

Inspectors were ordered in to the Birmingham schools after a 'Trojan Horse' letter was uncovered last month detailing a plot by hardline Muslims to force moderate and secular headteachers from their posts and install extreme Islamic teachers in their place.

Today a report published in The Telegraph alleges that Park View, Golden Hillock, Nansen, Oldknow and Saltley schools will be rated inadequate, the lowest possible score, while Alston school is already in special measures.

If the new 
Ofsted investigation does place the schools in special measures, Tahir 
Alam, who is also governor of Highfield school, is almost certain to be 
removed from his post.

Mr
 Alam, an activist for the hardline Muslim Council of Britain, is alleged to be at the centre of the trjan Horse plot, but has 
denied the allegations, calling them a 'fabrication'.

According to the Ofsted report, a further nine schools Springfield, Adderley, Regents Park, Highfield, Gracelands, Ladypool, Marlborough, Montgomery and Waverley will be given the second lowest rank of 'requiring improvement'.

A letter from Adderley school to parents yesterday confirmed the school had been subjected to a 'malicious and targeted' attempt to oust senior staff.

In its statement to parents, Adderley Primary's governing body confirmed that several headteachers in the city had  faced pressure to resign from their posts.

The school, which is also embroiled in a fraud inquiry into allegedly fake resignation letters, said: 'Many of you will now be aware that a number of headteachers across Birmingham have come forward and confirmed that they have experienced malicious and targeted campaigns to remove them and that this issue is not unique to the leadership of Adderley Primary School.

'The seriousness of this issue has now been taken up by the Department for Education who have appointed a new education adviser responsible for investigating this matter thoroughly.

'Birmingham City Council have also appointed a former head teacher, Ian Kershaw, as Birmingham's chief adviser to assist in a wider investigation.'

In a picture taken inside Park View school in 2008, boys and girls appear to have been segregated in an assembly. The school has always maintained segregation was voluntary, but an investigation found it was enforced by teachers

Park View school, along with its two sister schools Golden Hillock and Nansen, have bee rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted inspectors, along with Oldknow and Statley

The update for parents concluded: 'Attempts have been made at Adderley to destabilise the school by a very small but well organised group of individuals.

'The governors, headteacher, senior leadership team and staff have been robust in ensuring that Adderley remains a multi-cultural school providing a safe and positive learning environment for all of our 630 children.'

Four former staff members at the primary school were arrested on Thursday and have been bailed pending further inquiries into allegedly forged resignation letters.

Of the 17 schools investigated by Ofsted in connection with the plot, so far only one has been given a clean bill of health though another report is still to be completed.

Meanwhile a Department for Education (DfE) probe, lead by Peter Clarke, the former head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism unit, is thought to be looking into 25 schools in the area.

Yesterday The Telegraph revealed the DfE investigation found boys and girls had been forcibly segregated during lessons, Christian students had been left to teach themselves religious education, and any discussion of intimacy or the menstrual cycle had been banned in some classes.

The probe into Park View School, Golden Hillock and Nansen primary school found that Shiekh Shady al-Suleiman, a known al-Qaeda sympathiser who has previously said gay people should be stoned to death and espoused anti-semetic views, was also invited to speak to children.

A report from the Department for Education leaked yesterday found that pupils at Park View were forcibly segregated and Christian students were left to tech themselves. The headteacher, Lindsey Clark (pictured) was sidelined and eventually resigned

Pupils at two of the schools said the theory of evolution was only covered 'briefly' in biology, sex education was banned, and lessons on the arts and literature severely restricted or abandoned.

Despite these restrictions, Arabic lessons were compulsory for all students. Pupils were also encouraged to begin and end lessons with  prayer, and loudspeakers were used to broadcast calls to prayer.

The report said headteachers at the schools were marginalised, with Park View, Golden Hillock and Nansen in reality being run by Tahir Alam, who ran the board of governors.

The headteacher of Park View, Lindsey Clark, resigned last month after being reduced to a 'figurehead' within the school, despite gaining the school an 'outstanding' Ofsted rating.

In a statement to Mail Online, the Park View Education Trust said: 'Just two years ago Park View was the first Academy to be rated 'Outstanding' in all categories under the new Ofsted inspection regime.

'It took more than 10 years to build the school to its Outstanding levels, from a situation where children were being failed and the school was in special measures.

'Park View is now the most successful school in England serving its social group - that is, with 72% of pupils on free school meals.

'If the inspectors who carried out both inspections at Park View Academy have ignored these achievements then we have to conclude that they are working to a different set of criteria than is normally used for an Ofsted inspection.'

However, the spokesman refused to comment on the current allegations, saying only that they did not recongise reports that some of the schools would close.

A spokesman for Ofsted refused to comment on the report, but yesterday a spokesman for the Department for Education said: 'The allegations made in relation to some schools in Birmingham are very serious and we are investigating all evidence put to us in conjunction with Ofsted, Birmingham City Council and the police.

'It is absolutely vital these investigations are carried out impartially, without pre-judgment.

Birmingham City Council is also investigating 15 schools, though the DfE is thought to be frustrated with attempts by the council to play down what is happening in the schools.
