A worker at a Red Robin in Missouri has been diagnosed with hepatitis A and now health officials fear that more than 5,000 customers may have been exposed to the disease.

The infected individual has not been identified and the only detail that has been released is that they work at the Springfield, Missouri location.

USA Today reports that the employee's condition was reported to the Springfield-Greene County Health Department on Tuesday and they have now called on anyone who ate at the location at any point in the last two weeks.

Customer call back: An employee at this Springfield, Missouri Red Robin has hepatitis A and may have spread the disease to customers between May 6 and May 8

Hepatitis A is a highly-contagious liver disease that can cause inflammation which, in turn, prevents the organ from operating properly.

The disease typically spreads through contact with water or food that an infected individual has touched, making the employee's job at a fast food restaurant even more dangerous and susceptible to spread.

'Upon being informed of the incident, the Springfield Red Robin took all safety measures to ensure the well-being of our guests and team members including arranging the inoculation of all Springfield team members with the immune globulin prophylaxis shot,' Red Robin officials said in a statement.

This is the second time this month that a Red Robin employee has been diagnosed with hepatitis A, though the earlier instance was at a Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania outpost.

Passing through food: Hepatitis A regularly spreads when infected individuals handle food or drinks

In that case, the local health authority did not feel it was necessary to put out a call for the public to seek immediate medical treatment.

That wasn't the case in the latest case in Missouri, as the county health department has announced that they feel anyone who ate at the restaurant between May 6 and May 8 should be immunized.

'We did extensive investigations through inspections and determined it was a significant risk and that we needed to notify the public and have some immunization clinics to try to prevent any further spread of hepatitis A,' Springfield-Greene County Health Department director Kevin Gipson said.

Downward trend: The number of acute hepatitis A infections in the United States have dropped dramatically due to the development of a vaccine

The problem facing the containment process is that infected individuals do not necessarily display symptoms, though adults are more likely to feel nauseous and notice a spike in their temperature, a yellowing of their skin and vomiting.

Most cases are deemed mild and do not require serious treatment, resolving itself in a few weeks without causing permanent damage, but that is not always the case.

'Any time we have these cases we err on the side of caution. We never take the publicâ€™s health for granted so we have scheduled a couple of clinics,' Mr Gipson said.

This possible outbreak comes at a relative low point for the disease as the Centers for Disease Control have reported that while there were more than 30,000 cases of acute hepatitis A in the early 1990s but now the vaccine has led to only 2,700 acute cases being reported in 2011.
