As England slunk home from the 2010 World Cup, Wayne Rooney handed general manager Franco Baldini his No 10 shirt from the tournament.

It was a touching gesture, thanking Baldini for his support in South Africa before Rooney’s world fell apart amid allegations about his personal life.

This time, Rooney is taking steps to make sure that his World Cup experience in Brazil is considered a success. A week ahead of schedule, he boarded a plane bound for a holiday on the Algarve on Monday night with two Manchester United fitness coaches for company.

Hard working: Rooney has enjoyed a strong season personally for United, despite the club's struggles

Rooney, who missed United’s last three Barclays Premier League fixtures with a groin injury, is paying for the two members of United’s staff to be with him. He means business.

It is on the lush training pitches of the Vale do Lobo complex that Rooney’s preparations will begin.

Next Monday, the rest of Roy Hodgson’s 23-man squad, plus Jon Flanagan and John Stones, will join Rooney in Portugal for the World Cup training camp.

England’s manager said: ‘Wayne is so determined to be up and running when we get there on the 19th. He’s going there with two trainers. I don’t know who exactly but Tony Strudwick (United’s head of fitness) has been in touch wanting to know about the pitch.

‘Wayne’s attitude is that he’s desperate to be up and running on the 19th. I’m not as desperate, I’m thinking more of June 14, but it’s still quite laudable.

‘I’m not trying to dissuade him. If they’ve got houses out there, that’s where they go on their week off. They don’t all go to Dubai and Las Vegas.’

Ah, Vegas. Someone had to mention the gambling capital of the world and it was Hodgson who duly brought up Rooney’s preparations for his previous international tournament.

Two years ago Rooney spent time at the craps tables of a prominent Las Vegas casino before he joined up with the England squad to prepare for Euro 2012. In the end, England were the biggest losers.

Time to shine: Rooney has endured a succession of injury-hit and frustrating tournaments with England

Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, Rooney is showing admirable maturity after missing United’s last three games. Had they been critical fixtures he could have played, but Ryan Giggs, United’s interim  manager, acknowledging the importance of this World Cup, gave him some time off.

This is another chance for Rooney to prove he really is one of the best footballers in the world. The England forward  has yet to score at a World Cup — an incredible statistic given his standing in the game.

The World Cup, which starts for England on June 14 against Italy in Manaus, could be 28-year-old Rooney’s last chance and he seems determined to take it.

Hodgson said: ‘It’s up to Wayne if he wants to go away. I’m more than happy for the players to forget about football for a week and to get mentally prepared for the weeks ahead.’

The tournament may be a long slog for England’s players and Rooney, notoriously, has found it difficult to cope with extended periods away from his family home in Prestbury, Cheshire.

The real deal: Wayne Rooney is instrumental to England's World Cup hopes

Fighting fit: Man United's head of fitness Tony Strudwick has been in contact with Hodgson

In 2006 he was sent off in the quarter-final against Portugal and four years later, under Fabio Capello in South Africa, he was in meltdown.

After Rooney shouted his criticism of England’s travelling fans into a TV camera following a desperate 0-0 draw against Algeria, the team were taken apart by Germany and were heading for home.

At full throttle Rooney is still England’s main threat, a player with immense pedigree after another decent scoring return during qualifying.

He has been in good nick for United this season, netting 17 goals during a difficult year under the sacked David Moyes.

‘I hope he will join in with us straight away on the 19th,’ said Hodgson. ‘Let’s hope he can show the form that makes Wayne Rooney what he is.’

Fully fit, you can put your shirt on him.
