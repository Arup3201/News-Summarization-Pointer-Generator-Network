The haze of time and fun nights out can make it hard to remember everyone you knew at university.

So one Art student in Holland came up with an idea that meant she wouldn't have to: she took photographs of all the people who shared her bed.

Katy Strange, 24, took the intimate collection of portraits while studying at The Maastricht Academy of Fine Arts and called it 789 - the exact number of days she spent creating the project.

Snooze who? Katy Strange, 24, took the intimate collection of portraits while studying at The Maastricht Academy of Fine Arts

Bedmate diary: To determine who her absolute best friends were, she decided to photograph only the ones who she'd known well enough to share a bed with

Just good friends: Her subjects include friends both male and female in various stages of undress - but only one with whom she had a sexual relationship. She wouldn't say which one

Her subjects include friends both male and female in various stages of undress - but only one with whom she had a sexual relationship.

'The 789 series is about how I lived my 
life as a student,' she told MailOnline. 'This was for my graduation project and it 
made me think a lot.

Two years: She called the project 789 - the exact number of days she spent creating it

Image of record: She says she wanted the series to be about 'how I lived my life as a student'

I am my friends: She says the idea grew when she became tired of focusing her work solely on herself

Revelation: She then realised what a 'huge role my friends had on me during this period of time'

Old and new: She made a lot of new friends 'and a couple of old ones'

Big influence: She says the people in these portraits 'are the ones who made me the person I am today'

'Throughout four years studying at the Art Academy, my work
always focused on myself - four years 
of doing only self-portraits.

'But then I 
realised what a huge role my friends had on me during this period of 
time. I made a lot of new friends and a couple of old ones. These
people are the ones who made me the person I am today.'

To determine who her absolute best friends were, she decided to photograph only the ones who she'd known well enough to share a bed with.

Varied: The pictures in her collection are all in a series of different poses and expressions

Good times: To determine who her absolute best friends were, she decided to photograph only the ones who she'd known well enough to share a bed with

Larking about: In some of the pictures she is pictured simply messing about on her bed

Bed pals: Katy insists all of the people in her photographs are 'just really close friends'

More than friends? She says there was only one person in the pictures with whom she 'had something more'

Mystery: But she would not reveal which the 'more than a friend' was

Katy says: Let me show you my friends and you tell me who I am

So she telephoned each one to recreate the scenes that had taken place when they shared a bed during her time at university.

'All of the people who slept in my bed are
just really close friends,' she added. 'There was only one person with whom I had something more.'

She continued: 'I want people to know that all of my friends are different - and that's why they are truly important to me. Let me show you my friends and you tell me who I am.'
