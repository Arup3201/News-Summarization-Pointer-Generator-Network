Alexis Sanchez scored another crucial goal for Arsenal at the Emirates, just as as all appeared to be lost against Southampton.

The Chile international hauled Arsenal from the depths of despair once more and it did not go unnoticed.

Fraser Forster appeared to be a thorn in the Gunners side but Sanchez popped up with a late,late winner and Twitter did not hesitate to show its relief that he managed to do so.
