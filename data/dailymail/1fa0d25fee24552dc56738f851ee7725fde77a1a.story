An Arizona sheriff is defending his decision to use a helicopter on Thursday that cost $650 dollars per hour to search for a missing dog.

Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County stood behind the choice to use a helicopter to search for pooch Valor, a German shepherd mix, while speaking to KPNX.

'They don't seem to complain when people go up mountains or jump in lakes and we're spending all those resources when they never should have done that,' he said on Saturday.Â  'We would do it anyway.'

'Maybe the dog might have some evidence, too, to develop our investigation,' he added.

The search for Valor comes after 20 dogs were found dead at Green Acres, a boarding house in Gilbert, the sheriff's office said. Valor was rumored to have fled the property.

Green Acres' owners said a dog had chewed through an air conditioning wire and the dogs died of heat exhaustion, authorities said.

Valor's owner Heather Wicker told KPNX on Saturday tracker dogs were used to search for her pet.

'We were only 45 minutes behind him at that point,' Wicker said. 'Cause somebody that saw him, we got the [tracker dogs] on him, and we followed him and at that point it was just so hot outside the trackers were just exhausted.'

The sheriff's office said Thursday three mounted posse members and two deputies also aided in the search for Valor.

On Saturday night, a vigil was held in the dogs' memory in Phoenix. Arpaio was in attendance was K-9 officers, AZFamily.com reported.

On Monday, the number of dead dogs grew to 21, MyFoxPhoenix reports.

That number was not immediately confirmed by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office to MailOnline.

The affiliate station reported that investigators have not filed charges against Green Acres' owners, Jesse and Maleisa Hughes, nor Logan and Austin Flake, who were looking after the dogs when they died.

'To get search warrants you need probable cause, you need evidence, and we are doing this right, we anticipate a search warrant will be issued soon,' Arpaio told the station.

Austin Flake is the son of Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ).
