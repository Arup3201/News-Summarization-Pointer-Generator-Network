A great-grandmother who survived the Holocaust died on Saturday after a driver backed into her while she was crossing the street.

Gitzella Katz, 92, had lived in Brooklyn since immigrating to the U.S. following the Second World War.

Mrs Katz was with her 68-year-old daughter when an SUV reversing into a parking spot crushed her shortly before 10pm in a quiet street in Brooklyn, New York.

The elderly woman and her daughter were crossing between parked cars on Clymer Street when the incident happened, authorities said.

The 26-year-old driver of the Toyota Highlander has not been charged over the incident which happened the day before the start of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.

Mrs Katz, who was born in Hungary, was a much-loved and respected member of the Hasidic community in the New York borough and was described as a talented cook and 'capable woman'.Â 

Zilu Friedman, who said Mrs Katz was his grandmother-in-law, told DNAinfo.com: 'She was a good woman.'

A memorial service was held on Sunday at the Kavel Synagogue and attended by around 200 family members and friends, many of whom wept as her coffin was removed for burial.

The 92-year-old, who has more than ten grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren, came to America with her husband in 1963.

She lived alone but was always in the company of her two daughters. One daughter, 68, was injured on Saturday but believed to be in a stable condition.

Mrs Katz had shared little of her 
experiences at the hands of the Nazis but her family said that during the war she had 
been in several concentration camps with her sister.
