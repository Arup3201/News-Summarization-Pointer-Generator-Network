The Save the Children charity came under fire last night over a ‘malevolent and tasteless’ joke suggesting Margaret Thatcher was to blame for the torrential rain at Mandela’s memorial service.

A message posted on the charity’s official Twitter account stated: ‘I see it has rained all over the Mandela memorial. Has Thatcher already privatised the weather?’

It is the latest in a series of controversies involving the charity, now run by £163,000-a-year Justin Forsyth, a former Downing Street aide to Gordon Brown.

It is also embarrassing for David Cameron, whose wife Samantha is a Save the Children ‘ambassador’ and who hosted a No10 reception for it.

Earlier this month she launched its £1million Christmas Jumper Day appeal to encourage people to wear a festive sweater and give £1.

On Friday, all Downing Street staff turned up for work in a woolly.

Lady Thatcher, who died in April, was criticised by Labour while she was Prime Minister for refusing to back tougher anti-apartheid sanctions.

But ex-Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit last night led a chorus of Tory criticism of the charity.

‘I would have thought a charity called Save the Children would have been better employed saving children than sending out malevolent, tasteless and stupid tweets about such an event,’ he said.

‘Having met Nelson Mandela I know from personal experience he did not have an ounce of hostility towards Margaret Thatcher or her sensible stance on South Africa. If the Left had had its way, it would have been plunged into revolution.’

The tweet was posted on the charity’s official Twitter account  @SaveUKNews on Tuesday when the memorial service was hit by torrential rain. It was later deleted.

The charity’s profile has been raised since Mr Forsyth became chief executive, partly thanks to its emotive TV adverts. But not all the headlines have been favourable.

Mr Forsyth has been branded one of Britain’s growing number of charity ‘fat cats’. He earns £20,500 a year more than Mr Cameron; had £11,000 put in his pension last year and claimed more than £3,000 expenses.

Last week, BBC1’s Panorama challenged the charity over its former relationship with British Gas, claiming it downplayed criticism of energy companies over fuel poverty.

The charity denied the allegation.

Mr Forsyth also provoked controversy by arguing the charity’s work should include rescuing ‘starving’ British children, blaming Tory ‘cuts’.

A charity spokeswoman said: ‘It was wrong that this was tweeted and we apologise if anyone was offended.’
