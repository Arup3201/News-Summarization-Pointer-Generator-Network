A treasurer stole more than £300,000 from community services in a small town to pay her mortgage, redevelop her kitchen and pay for skiing trips.

Anne Yaman managed to avoid prison for months after she forged a series of sick notes from medical professionals claiming she was too unwell to attend court, and even hoodwinked a judge.

The fraudster fiddled the accounts of the Bentham Development Trust in North Yorkshire, which she had access to and even caused a community bus service to go into liquidation, costing 15 people their jobs. She also abused her position as treasurer of a youth cafe to steal money to cover up her fraud.

Anne Yaman has been jailed for four years after she stole £131,000 from a charity community organisation to fund ski holidays and pay her mortgage, and also deceived a judge with a string of fake doctor's notes

Yaman, 63, was sentenced to four years in prison by Judge Jonathan Rose.

He said: 'You are a person who has proceeded with wicked determination, forged documents, and stolen money for your own selfish ends and with no care for those who would be so badly hurt, your only thoughts were for your own greed.'

After she pleaded guilty to fraud Yaman further evaded punishment by forging a series of eight sick notes on headed notepaper to avoid attending court. 

Matthew Bean, prosecuting, told Bradford Crown Court that Yaman secured a job as office manager with the Bentham Development Trust (BDT), a registered charity, in 2008. 

The trust, which had an annual turnover of £400,000 and ran the Little Red Bus service to help children and the elderly get around the rural community.

As office manager she had access to two HSBC accounts, and in November 2011 a local kitchen contractor contacted the trustees after he was paid with a charity cheque for private work he had done on Yaman's home.

An investigation found Yaman had been forging the signatures of the trustees David Alder and Robert Sloane to write cheques to herself.

She had also stolen £94,000 by transferring funds to her personal accounts via online banking.

Yaman was sentenced to four years in prison for the frauds and the deceptions at Bradford Crown Court

Yaman used the money to pay off her Visa credit card, give money to her son, pay her mortgage and service a personal loan, as well as buy kitchen appliances and pay for two £3,000 ski-ing holidays for her and her Turkish husband.

As well as being office manager of the BDT, Yaman was treasurer of Bentham Youth Café and the Low Bentham Victoria Institute. She abused her position to take money from these organisations to prop-up the BDT accounts and conceal her fraud.

She had also not been paying VAT totalling £159,000 between 2009 and 2011 and had used this money to keep the trust solvent.

To further cover her tracks Yaman acted as a bogus accountant to falsify accounts for 2009, 2010, and 2011 and did not forward £63,555 trust employees were due in PAYE to HMRC.

When she was arrested the BDT's accounts were frozen and the Little Red Bus went into liquidation.  

At a hearing last summer Yaman, who moved to Seaford, East Sussex, pleaded guilty to three charges of fraud, three charges of false accounting and theft between January 2009 and November 2011. 

She was due to be sentenced in July last year but used deception again to avoid coming to court. 

Judge Jonathan Rose was hoodwinked by Yaman's forged letters and said she carried out the fraud and deceptions with 'wicked determination' 

Officials at Bradford Crown Court received a GP's letter on headed notepaper from the Old School Surgery explaining Yaman had serious heart and problems and claiming she was too ill to attend court.

Judge Jonathan Rose received a series of eight letters over the next few months, excusing her from hearings which caused them to be adjourned. These letters were produced on official doctors' headed paper, including from the Brighton and Sussex University NHS Trust, and signed by named cardiac consultants, doctors and surgeons excusing Yaman's attendance on serious health grounds.

But all the letters were false and had been forged by Yaman.  

Judge Rose eventually became suspicious and in December she was arrested in Sussex and admitted forging the documents and pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice.

Yaman had previously been in prison in the U.S. for 18 months in 1982 for an offence of larceny - a common law offence for taking a person's property unlawfully.

Philip Wakeham, defending, said Yaman had stolen from the BDT to fund 'a better lifestyle' and had used some of her money after she married a man from Turkey. 

He said she forged letters because she was scared of going to prison.  

Yaman was sentenced to three years in prison for the theft, fraud and false accounting and a further 16 months for perverting the course of justice.

Sentencing Judge Rose told Yaman: 'You are a person who has proceeded with wicked determination, forged documents, and stolen money for your own selfish ends and with no care for those who would be so badly hurt, your only thoughts were for your own greed.'

He told Yaman she had caused the destruction of a charitable enterprise and her crimes have had 'devastating consequences' on its employees.

Judge Rose said the medical letters had been 'forged with no little skill'.
