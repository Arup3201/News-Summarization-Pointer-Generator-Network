Kenya has been named the most romantic movie location to steal a smooch in celebration of International Kissing Day.

Ranked in first place, the African country’s Ngong Hills have been described as the best place on earth for couples to pucker up – thanks to the Robert Redford-starring Out Of Africa film.

In second place of the dreamiest destinations inspired by movies is Paris, thanks to Before Sunset, with lead Ethan Hawke; followed by New York where some of Sleepless in Seattle was filmed.

Romantic destination: Kenya's Ngong Hills was ranked in first place thanks to the Out Of Africa movie

Rome featured fourth – thanks to Roman Holiday starring Audrey Hepburn – and the stunning Wicklow Mountains in Ireland, featured in PS I Love You, make up the top five.

The list, put together by Travelzoo, celebrates International Kissing Day on Sunday, and ranks Halona Cove, Hawaii in sixth place – due to the film From Here To Eternity, starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr.

Gone With The Wind location Atlanta features in seventh place, followed by Tokyo with Scarlett Johansson's Lost In Translation, then Bakewell in England with Pride & Prejudice, and Chocolat destination Burgundy in France makes up the top 10.

Maire Bonheim, a spokesman for Travelzoo, said: ‘Lovers and singletons can travel around the world and back in time with our selection of favourite romantic flicks of all time. 

‘The 10 destinations each reflect a memorable love story to inspire those looking for a smooch.’

1.    Ngong Hills, Kenya – Out of AfricaWhy not embark on a safari deep into the wilds of Kenya in search of love? You could very well find the next Robert Redford to wash your hair.

2.    Paris, France – Before Sunset

The City of Love offers endless spots for romance, from a kiss at the top of the Eiffel Tower to a love-binding lock on the Pont des Arts, but singletons can also take a chance (like Ethan Hawke) at finding the perfect stranger to watch the sunset with.

Gone With The Wind! Atlanta made it into the top 10 list, which celebrates International Kissing Day

3.    New York, US – Sleepless in SeattleTake a break from all that shopping and get a bird’s-eye view of New York City from the top of the Empire State Building. Be on the lookout for your very own Annie (or Sam) while you’re up there.

4.    Rome, Italy – Roman HolidayExplore the ancient side streets and piazzas of Italy’s capital with your partner in crime – just like Audrey Hepburn – but don't forget to throw a coin into the Trevi Fountain.

5.    Wicklow Mountains, Ireland – P.S. I Love YouThe beautiful Wicklow Mountains lie just an hour’s drive south of Dublin. This beauty spot in the Garden of Ireland could be just the place to search for your very own Gerard Butler.

Historic hideaway: Chatsworth House was used in the filming of Pride and Prejudice and is the perfect place to recreate your favourite Darcy moment

Trevi treasure: The many delights of Rome can be explored as you recreate the movie Roman Holiday

6.    Halona Cove, Hawaii – From Here to EternityCouples can re-enact the moment from 60 years ago when Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr got audiences’ hearts racing with their steamy kiss on the tropical island of Oahu. 

7.    Atlanta, USA – Gone With the WindTravel back to a bygone era as you stroll down Peachtree Street with your sweetheart in one hand and a mint julep in the other. And remember to slow down - ‘after all, tomorrow is another day’.

Illuminating: Bustling Tokyo didn't seem like a romantic destination... until Lost in Translation hit our screens

8.    Tokyo, Japan – Lost in TranslationLose yourself in the bustling metropolis that is Tokyo and maybe you'll encounter someone to do some soul-searching with… like Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.

9.    Bakewell, England – Pride & PrejudicePack a picnic and head to Chatsworth House in Derbyshire. This stately home, the location for the 2005 film version of Jane Austen’s classic, is the perfect place to recreate the passion between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth.

10.    Burgundy, France – ChocolatOne taste of this wine region is all it takes to fall under the spell, just as a gypsy-like Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche did in this film from 2000.
