A Nashville man had such a beef with a McDonald's after they left a McDouble cheeseburger off of his order that he allegedly returned to the fast food chain with a gun.

North Precinct detectives are on the hunt for Demetri Johnson, 21, who allegedly visited the Brick Church Pike McDonald's on Thursday, ordered food, and came back with a pistol demanding the restaurant fix his order and give him fries and sodas as well as a form of compensation.

Police told The Tennessean that Johnson placed an order at the drive-thru then pulled away with his food.

A few minutes later he returned to tell the drive-thru that he was missing his cheeseburger and that's when the manager allegedly told him to pull over and park so he could give him his missing sandwich.

That's when Johnson supposedly walked into the restaurant with a gun followed by an entourage of three women.

Police say that he not only ordered the workers to give him the missing McDouble Cheeseburger but that he also demanded they give him new soda and extra French fries.

After Johnson and company got their food they left and that's when the McDonald's contacted police.

The Smoking Gun reports that Johnson is being sought on a felony aggravated assault charge. 

Johnson has a criminal record and was arrested for weapons possession and theft.
