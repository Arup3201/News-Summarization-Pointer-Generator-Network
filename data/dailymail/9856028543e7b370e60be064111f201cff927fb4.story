The 29-year-old had hoped for home advantage but his promoter Eddie Hearn lost out when the fight went to purse bids earlier this month.

DeGale will, however, earn a minimum of $1.5million (£1m) from the bout.

Andre Dirrell has lost one professional fight in his career - to Carl Froch back in 2009

'Andre Dirrell is a very, very good opponent,'he told Sky Sports News. 'He's tall, a tricky southpaw and he's a bit like me. People say our styles will clash but I think we'll gell. We're both ambitious, there's a lot on the line.'

Dirrell is no stranger to British fans after losing a split decision to Froch in Nottingham in 2009, his only professional defeat to date.

The 31-year-old has fought just six times since, but enjoyed three routine victories last year.
