Christian Taylor was sentenced to 27 months in jail after stealing nearly £100,000 from church funds

A church treasurer who stole £100,000 from ecclesiastical funds by forging the signature of the vicar, has been sentenced to more than two years behind bars.

Christian Taylor was responsible for the bank accounts of St Nicholas Church in Great Kimble and All Saints Church in Little Kimble, Buckinghamshire.

But two months into his voluntary role as treasurer, the 61-year-old started to line his own pockets.

Taylor made a series of false claims to the Listed Places of Worship (LPW) Scheme - a Government programme that allows churches to claim back VAT on building works.

The four claims, totaling £54,535, were made using the forged signature of Janet Henderson, the newly appointed vicar of the two churches.

Once the money from the false claims landed in the church bank accounts, Taylor transferred the cash to himself.

In addition Taylor stole another £42,358 from other church funds.

Prosecutor Rachel Drake told Aylesbury Crown Court said Taylor's crimes had gone undetected for two years.

She said the 61-year-old started as treasurer in May 2008, but it was not until May 2010, when a new manager at the Natwest branch where the Kimble church accounts were held, that Taylor's wrongdoing was exposed.

'Kay Smith, the new manager, was concerned about the frequency with which the defendant was going into the bank and withdrawing cash from the church accounts,' Miss Drake told the court.

She said Taylor was sometimes spotted in the bank branch several times a day.

Mrs Smith wrote to one of the signatories of the church accounts, Michael Smith, but Taylor told him he would deal with the issue.

In July 2010 Taylor met with the bank, with a man pretending to be Mr Smith, who said the church was happy with his work.

Taylor began lining his own pockets with money through false claims to recoup VAT on building works that were never carried out, two months into his voluntary role at St Nicholas Church in Great Kimble, above

A spot-check made on behalf of the LPW scheme involved a check made with an architect listed on one of Taylor's claims.

When asked if there was an invoice for the work allegedly carried out, the architect said no invoice existed.

When police arrested Taylor in March 2011, officers discovered one of the fake invoices saved on his computer.

'Police have been trying to identify 
the other person who must have been working alongside this defendant but
 he said he can’t remember the meeting at the bank,' said Miss Drake.

'Not
 only has this put the church council into severe financial 
difficulties, it has also had a detrimental effect on relationships in 
this community.'

The court was told Taylor had a string of previous convictions for theft dating from the 1960s and 70s, including theft by an employee in 1971.

Martin Bloor, defending Taylor, told Judge 
Sheridan: 'He accepts his behaviour showed planning and sophistication 
in relation to the documents used.'

The court heard £54,000 had yet to be recovered and that Taylor suffered from mental health issues, including anxiety and depression.

Taylor, who was also treasurer for All Saints Church in Little Kimble, pictured, was only found out after a new bank manager at the Natwest branch. which held the church accounts, spotted the unusual goings on

'He says he did not intend to hurt 
anybody personally but accepts it has and is ashamed of the effect it 
has had on these people,' said Mr Bloor.

Judge Sheridan said Taylor, from Stokenchurch, acted 'deliberately 
and systematically' in beginning the fraud so soon after his appointment
 in May 2008.

'Everybody 
took you on face value as a thoroughly good egg, but sure as eggs is 
eggs, they did not know about your old convictions,' he said.

He said Rev. Henderson, Mr Smith and all other church 
representatives were blameless victims of Taylor’s fraud, which had also
 cost the church council more than £22,000 in legal fees and investigations.

'I
 wish to pay tribute to the bank manager, who excelled in her vigilance 
in keeping a close eye on the affairs of her customers,' he said.

Taylor,
 who works as a telephone canvasser and admitted the crimes, was sentenced to a
 total of 27 months in prison for two charges of fraud and two of transferring criminal property.

A third charge of fraud and one of 
possession of articles for use in fraud were ordered to lie on file.

An order to recover the money under the Proceeds of Crime Act was also made, a hearing is due to take place on March 14.
