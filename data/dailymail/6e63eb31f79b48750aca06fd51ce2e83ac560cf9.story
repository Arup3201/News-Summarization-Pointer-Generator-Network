When your most famous resident is the Queen you might expect your neighbours to be a bit on the wealthy side.

Now new research has confirmed the Berkshire town of Windsor has the wealthiest residents in Britain boasting more than 850 dollar millionaires.

Which means the Queen, who spends many weekends at Windsor Castle, is only one of hundreds of so-called ‘high net worth’ people who live in the town.

Windsor’s other dollar millionaire residents include Elton John, the singer Natalie Imbruglia and the golfer Nick Faldo.

The list was compiled by the business information group WealthInsight which collated the details of people with net assets of more than $1m (£650,000) excluding the value of their home.

It found Henley on Thames in Oxfordshire was the fastest growing town on the list with dollar millionaire numbers rising there by 25% since 2007.

That compares with a general decrease by 9% in the number of dollar millionaires in the UK as a whole over the same period.

The research also found Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire has the highest average house prices outside London at £490,000 and the highest average income per household at £71,700.

Eight of the top ten wealthiest towns and villages - including Weybridge in Surrey and Sevenoaks, Kent - were within 30 miles of London.

But they also included the towns of Hale and Alderley Edge in Cheshire which are favourites of Manchester United footballers and Coronation Street stars.

Andrew Amolis an analyst with WealthInsigh said: ‘Towns in the London commuter belt dominate the top 10, although it is interesting to see that a couple of small towns around Manchester also make the list.

‘This reflects the affluent nature of the Cheshire area.’

Towns that narrowly missed out on the top ten include the Burford in the Cotswolds, Ilkley in west Yorkshire, Windermere in the Lake District and Ponteland in Northumberland.

Each of these towns have more than 200 dollar millionaires each.
