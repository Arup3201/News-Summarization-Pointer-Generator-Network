Danielle Watson claimed she had late-stage cervical cancer so friends and kindhearted strangers would pay for her wedding - but she was not sick

A young mother who defrauded friends and kindhearted strangers out of thousands of pounds to pay for her dream wedding by claiming she had terminal cancer will not be jailed.

Mother-of-two Danielle Watson, 24, claimed she had late-stage cervical cancer to get her hands on donations, freebies and cut-price deals for her wedding worth almost £10,000 - even conning her husband into believing she was dying.

There was fury outside Basildon Crown Court today after a judge ruled she should not be jailed for the fraud. 

Watson, of Rowhedge, Colchester, fooled dozens of people by giving regular updates on how her condition was progressing, a court heard today.

The then 21-year-old admin assistant even brought forward her wedding by several months to April 2012 so she could walk up the aisle before radiotherapy and chemotherapy were 'due' to make her hair fall out. 

In reality she had only had minor surgery for a treatable gynaecological condition and had never been diagnosed with, or treated for, cancer.

Well-wishers had raised more than £6,000 for a specialist Vitamin C cancer treatment only available in America for Watson through fundraising events.

Business owners also helped organise her dream wedding to husband Chris Watson in April 2012.

Watson, who claimed she had the same condition as Jade Goody, was gifted a lavish £3,500 wedding package at the Ivory Rooms - a sophisticated bar and restaurant in Billericay, Essex - involving a three-course wedding breakfast, evening buffet and DJ.

Other freebies included a £700 rented wedding dress which was never returned, wedding planning services priced at £1,100, hair styling and 10 bottles of champagne. 

Watson admitted six counts of fraud by false representation and sobbed in the dock as Recorder Gerard Pounder sentenced her to 12 months in prison suspended for two years. She must also carry out 200 hours of unpaid work in the community.

He said: 'You showed a supreme lack of maturity in the way in which you conducted your life.

'It is a great testament to the many people who dealt with you with supreme generosity because they believed you only had a short time left on this planet.' 

Watson, who even convinced her husband Chris Watson that she had cancer, raised £10,000 in cash and freebies

Despite her fraud, Watson was not jailed and was given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years

He did not order her to pay prosecution costs so she can use the money to repay her victims.

One of the victims, Victoria Oliver, who raised about £2,000 for Watson after hearing her sob story through a friend - said she was stunned at today's sentence.

She said: 'I think it is an absolute travesty she hasn't been made an example of. She conned hundreds of people.

'It is disgusting that she has shown absolutely no remorse and is now effectively walking away scot free.'

The personal banker from Billericay added: 'By the time we knew what she had done there was no money in the account. She had spent it all.

'This has had a bid effect on me. I raised a lot of money in a short space of time.

'I've now lost confidence in doing something like that again. I just hope he genuine people don't lose out on donations because of her lies.'

Paul Hatton, 43, general manager at The Ivory Rooms, where her wedding was held, said: 'When Danielle came to me and said she had the same disease as Jade Goody and cried it really pulled at my heart strings.

'We all just wanted to help her.

'Her wedding day was great as everyone in Billericay pulled together to make sure it was a memorable day. That memory is now very tainted.

'It's not about the money - it's about the loss of trust. That is what is so hard to forgive.

'She has also taken money that could have been used for someone who needed it and deserved it.' 

Watson admitted six counts of fraud by false representation and sobbed in the dock as Recorder Gerard Pounder sentenced her

Watson brought her six-week old son to court with her and wrote a personal letter to the judge expressing her remorse.

Rebecca Blain, mitigating, said Watson had only confirmed to her friends and family that she had told a lie on the day she pleaded guilty last October.

She added: 'The genesis of these lies was opportunistic. She did this on a whim and did not think through the wider impact of those lies.'

Watson has access to a 'substantial lump sum' and hopes to pay £800 a month back to her victims, Ms Blain added. 

Fundraisers who helped expose the con have managed to recover some of the funds and last year donated £6,563 to the Mercedes Curnow foundation - a genuine charitable cause dedicated to the early detection of cervical cancer.
