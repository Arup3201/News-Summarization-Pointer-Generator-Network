The Duchess of Cornwall discovered the perils of wearing pearls around children today.

Particularly if they happen to be large, shiny and, frankly, very tempting drop earrings.

On a visit to open the new Chelsea Children’s Hospital, Camilla was cuddling 10-month-old Maijed Dhaif when the baby made a grab for her jewellery.

The enterprising – and rather nattily dressed - youngster managed to yank the earring from her ear and waved it admiringly.

Yoink! The Duchess of Cornwall holds 10-month-old Maijed Dhaif, who managed to pull her earring off, as she visits the Operating Theatre Suite at the new Chelsea Children's Hospital,

Fortunately the royal – who has two children and five grandchildren of her own – took it all in her stride, reassuring wincing hospital staff: ‘Don’t worry, it’s a clip on.’

The Duchess appeared a natural as she cradled Maijid, who was born prematurely at 26 weeks and requires intravenous feeding due to ongoing gastroenterital difficulties,

‘Holding him like this reminds me of George,’ Camilla said, referring to her step-son, Prince William’s baby.

The Duchess was accompanying her husband on a visit to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital’s new state-of-the-art facility dedicated to providing specialist care for children.

Caring for more than 75,000 children, both inpatients and outpatients, each year, it is one of the busiest units in the country.

The royal visitors were taken to the Operating Theatre Suite where they met paediatric surgeons operating the UK’s only paediatric da Vinci robot.

Its arms move in a way which mimics the human wrist but with more precision, enabling operations to be carried out with more intricacy and less damage to tissue.

The Duchess was keen to try it for herself although, when she discovered just how tricky it really was joked that it was rather lucky there wasn’t a real patient there.

Charles quickly followed suit, with his wife providing what she described as a ‘back seat driver’ role.

The couple also met cheeky little James Middlehurst, son of Sky News presenter Paula Middlehurst, who showed off his prosthetic limb.

James, now five, was born with serious leg deformities which meant he might never walk.

In his short life, he has undergone countless, often agonising treatments, including the amputation of one foot, and was yesterday admitted to the hospital for further surgery.

But that has failed to alter his infectious zest for life and on meeting the prince yesterday he excitedly asked him what football team he supports.

Charles, looking a little flustered dodged the question, but when James revealed he supported beleaguered Manchester United, he prince muttered knowingly: ‘Ah, I don’t think we should talk about that.’

That's clever! The arm enables operations to be carried out with more intricacy and less damage and scarring to tissue

James then animatedly told the Duchess he had just been to see The Lego Movie to which Camilla, mimicking the film’s catchphrase, replied: ‘As yes, my grandchildren have been to see that. It’s awesome!’

Camilla had most success at the helm of the £1 million state-of-the-art surgical arm, which moves in a way which mimics the human wrist but with more precision.

She was soon able to master the device, as a doctor joked: 'The patient is alive!'

Charles quickly gave up after struggling to get the hang of the mechanism. Both he and Camilla were later presented with certificates of competence in surgical training.

They greeted a number of young patients and their parents at the hospital, which was created through a redevelopment of paediatric services at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

The children's hospital has been treating patients since September 2011. It now comprises four new paediatric theatres, four new wards including a high dependency unit, dedicated children's burns unit, and a neonatal intensive care unit.

The new facility follows in the tradition of its predecessor, Westminster Children's Hospital, which was built in 1907 and had its services transferred to Chelsea and Westminster when it was opened by the Queen in 1993.

Unveiling a plaque to open the facility, Charles said: "We are so delighted to come and join you on this occasion. We both worried a great deal that we'd caused enough disruption to the smooth running of this hospital for one day.

'But nevertheless we've had a brief glimpse of the remarkable services provided by the hospital and in particular the children's department. We'd like to congratulate all those who completed the project on time and on budget. It is a remarkable achievement.'

The Prince also hailed the role played by nurses and volunteers at the hospital, adding: 'You play such an important part in the life of the capital and the life of the country and you've transformed so many people's lives.'

Simon Eccles, clinical director of children's and young people's services, said: 'I hope you've had a flavour of what the children's hospital is all about. It's about all aspects of children's care, educating them, to give them and their families the absolute best care in London.'
