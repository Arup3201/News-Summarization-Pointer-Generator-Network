Little known Christina McHale may now have to change her name to Christina ‘McHurl’ after she blew chunks during her first round match at the Australian Open on Tuesday.

But the American did not let the unscheduled sick break faze her as she won a marathon encounter against France’s Stephanie Foretz despite vomiting several times during the match.

9 News reported that with the scores locked at 4-4 in the deciding set, the world number 54 walked over to the back of one of the outside courts at Melbourne Park and was violently sick.

After staggering over to the back of one of the outside courts Christina McHale could hold it back no longer

The world number 54 player had been feeling ill for a few games beforehand and vomited

Once she gets started though, the poor 22-year-old player just can't stop 

After being asked questions by a trainer, the 22-year-old remained in the shade on her haunches before vomiting again.

She eventually made her way back to her court-side seat after speaking briefly to the chair umpire.

However she bravely soldiered on and eventually won an exhausting 22-game third set to clinch the match 6-4, 1-6, 12-10.

Reasons to be cheerful: Despite vomiting on court the American was still able to win her marathon match against Stephanie Foretz of France 6-4, 1-6, 12-10

Ms McHale takes a moment to compose herself before heading back to the court

‘I realized I hadn’t been feeling well, and finally I knew it was coming up. I don’t know what caused it,’ she said.

‘I was just embarrassed that it took so long to clean up. But I did feel much better after I let it out.’

She added that she was not offended by ESPN’s decision to show her vomiting during the match saying: ‘It’s something unusual that happened. It’s their job to show what’s happening on the court during a match.’

But the American is still far from comfortable and holds her stomach before carrying on

All's well that ends well: A victorious Ms McHale leaves the court with an official after winning the match
