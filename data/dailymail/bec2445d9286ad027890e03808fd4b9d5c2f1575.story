A bright red miniature statue of Karl Marx given to a British city to commemorate his 195th birthday has been relegated to a back garden because a Tory-run council doesn't want it on display.

The four-foot tall, plastic sculpture of the communist revolutionary, was presented to Gloucester council by dignitaries from his birthplace of Trier, Germany - which is twinned with the city. 

Trier made 500 of the statues which were placed across the city, and one was donated to Gloucester in order to symbolise Marx's journey across Europe, because the cities are twinned.

A bright red miniature statue of Karl Marx given to a British city to commemorate his 195th birthday has been relegated to a back garden - because a Tory-run council doesn't want it on display

But the Conservative council said it 'would not be appropriate' to display the gift anywhere prominent.

Charles Yates, a member of GlosLinks, which maintains the link between Gloucester and twinned Trier, has instead given the statue a home in his back garden. 

He said: 'It needed a home and my wife and I were quite happy to have it here. He is stood in the garden quite happily.

'It is the sort of statue that guests will always make a comment about. It deserves to be put somewhere in the city. It deserves a home somewhere in Gloucester.

'This whole thing started because the German people asked us what we had done with it.

'It is all very well everyone making decisions about the statue but they haven't actually seen it yet.

'I am just amazed that nobody has come to see the statue.'

The statue of the revolutionary Trier-born socialist, who wrote The Communist Manifesto, was donated to Gloucester last May.

Transported to Britain on the Eurostar, the journey was meant to mimic the way Marx drifted across Europe.

Born in Trier in 1818, Marx moved to Berlin to study law before travelling to Paris, where he became a revolutionary communist.

Expelled from France, Marx spent two years in Brussels before moving to London, where he was to spend the remainder of his life.

Despite Marx's significance and political standing, the Conservative leader of the council does not believe it should be placed anywhere important.

Leader of Gloucester City Council Paul James said: 'We value our twinning links so I'm pleased we've been able to find somewhere to put Trier's kind gift.

'I don't think it would be appropriate to put it anywhere more prominent unless, perhaps, to warn people of the dangers of voting for Ed Miliband.'

The comment and political stance of the council has sparked fury with local councillors who says it should not be used as a political weapon, whether you agree with his politics or not.

Labour councillor Chris Chatterton said: 'I appreciated it's election time and silly season but you shouldn't say that.

'Whether you agree or disagree with Marx and Engels is up to you. Their theories changed the world. To make that kind of comment is misplaced.

'The statue shouldn't be bandied about as a political part.

'I think you take it on its merits. Just as a point of courtesy when any of us are given a gift you treat it with respect.

'Through time we have been given some very weird gifts and you may not want to put them on display but you treat it with courtesy.

'How many times have we gotten something at Christmas that we don't want but you don't just throw it away. You treat it with respect.' 

Born in Trier in 1818, Marx moved to Berlin to study law before travelling to Paris, where he became a revolutionary communist and befriended his life long collaborator, Friedrich Engels.

The pair co-authored the pamphlet 'The Communist Manifesto' which was published in 1848. It theorised that all human history had been based on class struggles.

Expelled from France, Marx spent two years in Brussels before moving to London, where he was to spend the remainder of his life.

He lived, for a number of years, in poverty supported by the wealthier Engels, before he produced his most important body of work, 'Das Kapital'. 

The first volume of this 'bible of the working class' was published in his lifetime, while the remaining volumes were edited by Engels after his friend's death.

He died on 14 March 1883 and was buried at Highgate Cemetery in London.
