Try as they might, President Barack Obama and his administration can no longer get away with attributing their 'scandals' to their predecessors, former Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday.

'They've been in office a long time now, going on six years,' Cheney pointed out on AM 970. 'They can't 
blame George Bush anymore.

'I think he's 
been a failure as a president,' Cheney charged.

Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, pictured here in Washington, D.C. in May, said Sunday that Obama is a 'failure as a president.'

Cheney, left, the former vice president under George W. Bush, center, said that the Obama administration can no longer blame his former boss for all their woes.

Cheney, who has returned to his Wyoming roots since serving as vice president under George W. Bush, told the radio station that Washington is 'a mess' these days he's glad he no longer has to live there.

'I think the scandals, with respect to the Veterans Administration, with respect to the IRS, these are bad situations,' he said, according to Business Insider.

'Even worse,' Cheney said, is the current administration's 'absolute gutting' of the military.

'The army is being cut by this administration back to a level that is lower than what we had at the time of Pearl Harbor in 1941.'

Cheney, a former Department of Defense Secretary under President H.W. Bush, said he'd learned that the army was about to get rid of 500 majors and it recently laid off a 'large group' of captains.

'They're dramatically cutting back the defense budget, year after year 
after year,' he opined.

While Cheney said he thinks Obama is out of line for scapegoating his predecessor, the former Bush administration official forewarned Obama that future presidents would be justified in reprobating him over the dilapidation of the U.S. military.

'I think it's a terrible mistake. I think we'll pay a terrible price for 
it down the road when his successors are faced with world crises and 
we don't have the kind of military that will let us guarantee that we 
can get a favorable outcome,' Cheney said of the cuts in audio of the interview provided by Mediate.

Noting that it takes years to train members of the nation's armed forces, Cheney argued that a draw down of forces would 'cripple us in future years.'

Cheney levied similar criticisms at Obama during a meeting of Republican Party officials on Thursday evening, Time reports.

'We need the world’s strongest military,' Cheney reportedly said. 'It’s as important now as it’s ever been.

'President Obama is making an enormous impact on some President 15 or 20 years from now when he has to respond to some crisis.

'I can guarantee you no future secretary of defense will call Barack Obama and thank him for what he did,' Cheney added.

Presumably speaking about the Middle East, Cheney said: 'We are not involved in that part of the world for charity. We are involved for our basic interests.'
