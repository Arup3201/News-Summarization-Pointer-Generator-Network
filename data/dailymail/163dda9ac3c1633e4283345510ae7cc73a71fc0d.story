When it comes to bells, nothing's been going right for Olympics organisers today.

There was confusion - even for over-excited Boris Johnson - this morning when Big Ben chimed at the bizarre time of 8.12am.

And as puzzled onlookers struggled to fathom the timing, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt almost took out spectators at another event when a bell he was ringing flew off its handle.

The farcical scenes unfolded as the capital prepared to begin the 'greatest show on earth' tonight by welcoming in the 2012 Olympics.

Ding-dong! Scroll down to watch the video

Careful! Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt rings his bell a little too enthusiastically this morning, sending the entire brass body of the instrument flying into the crowds

Yikes! M Hunt grimaces as he realises that his bell has broken. Luckily, nobody was injured after the accident

The Culture Secretary was ringing his
 bell in his right hand on the deck of HMS Belfast when the brass became
 detached from its wooden handle and shot through the air above the deck
 of the Second World War cruiser.

He watched helplessly as the bell 
disappeared among a group of Olympics fans, his face betraying the fear 
and horror that a bystander maybe seriously hurt.

But fortunately the bell missed 
hitting anyone, with a clearly relieved Mr Hunt caught on a Sky News 
camera saying: 'Oh, oh dear! Are you all right? Health and safety! Are you OK? There we are, disaster averted.'

The Belfast is permanently moored on 
the Thames near London's Tower Bridge, with Mr Hunt aboard as part of 
the All the Bells celebration as people across the country rang bells to
 mark the start of the 2012 Games.

The Tory minister later made light of the near-miss, comparing it with a scene from the BBC comedy Twenty Twelve.

He wrote on Twitter: 'Oops bell broke
 taking part in Martin Creed's ringing in of the Games...no one hurt but
 classic #twentytwelve moment.'

Mr Hunt later told the BBC: 'I was 
ringing a bell in a very excited way and it collapsed in my hand and 
went flying off. I had my very own 2012 moment. It was a clanger.'

The first of today's celebration 
began with Big Ben chiming non stop for three minutes from 8.12am while 
hundreds of churches and people across the nation rang their bells to 
greet the official start of London 2012.

The hour bell of the landmark Palace of Westminster pealed 40 times over the following three minutes. Special permission had to be gained for the hour bell at the Palace of Westminster to be allowed to toll out of its regular sequence.

But the actual timing of the event baffled many, as well as the London Mayor, who could not understand why it was ringing at that particular minute and so far in advance.

London Mayor Boris Johnson was puzzled when the bells rang out at 8.12am for three minutes

On the public's growing enthusiasm about the Olympics: 'A benign sort of virus passing from individual to individual'.

On describing his role in the opening ceremony: 'Just part of the politburo sitting there on the platform looking out rapturously'.

On the growing excitement about the Games: 'The Geiger counter of Olympomania is quivering towards the red zone...'

On the Opening Ceremony: ' I think people are going to well up with hot tears of patriotic pride when they see this'.

On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, presenter James Naughtie explained the idea, before revealing that the excitable Mr Johnson was just learning about it too.

He said: 'It is being rung at 8.12am because it's 12 hours until the 24 hour clock will reach 2012.

'Slightly
 complicated but you get the point. That was Boris Johnson on the phone,
 who obviously didn't know that coming on the line.'

To which Mr Johnson said: 'Yes, I was a bit mystified about that.'

Many have questioned why the bells are being rung 12 hours before the clock reaches 20:12, and not just wait until tonight.

Twitter users posted their confusion about their idea, saying the timing made no sense.

Shelley
 Taylor Tweeted: 'Why were the bells at 8:12am? That makes absolutely no
 sense with the 24 hour clock if they were going for 20:12.'

Another, called Johny Cassidy, posted: 'Would it not make more sense to ring Big Ben at 20:12 tonight?'

The
 celebrations are believed to be the first time that the strike of Big 
Ben has been rung outside its normal schedule since February 15 1952, 
when it tolled every minute for 56 strokes for the funeral of King 
George VI.

The bells at the
 National Assembly for Wales, Stormont in Northern Ireland and the 
Scottish Parliament also rang so that all four Parliaments chimed in 
unison at 8.12am, Olympics chiefs said.

The cacophony of sound is for the All 
The Bells event, the brainchild of Turner Prize-winning artist and 
musician Martin Creed who is encouraging everyone in the UK to ring a 
bell.

The piece of conceptual art, which has
 the official title Work No. 1197: All the bells in a country rung as 
quickly and as loudly as possible for three minutes, was devised as part
 of the London 2012 Festival.

Confusion
 aside, thousands threw themselves into the spirit of the event, with 
church bells, bicycle bells and even mast bells being rung all over the 
country as excitement swept the nation.

Speaking
 on the Today programme, Mr Johnson said the games had swept aside even 
the most cynical of sceptics and he hoped they would 'bring the whole 
country together'.

He said 
all expectations of the success of the Olympic Torch Relay had been 
surpassed as excitement about the games passed from person to person 
like a 'benign sort of virus'.

He said: 'It's unbelievable to watch people who are normally sceptical types to be caught up with the Olympic spirit.'

The red-faced blunder for Locog at Lord's was the latest of several slip-ups by organisers before the Opening Ceremony.

On Wednesday, video producers sparked a diplomatic row by mistakenly displaying a South Korean flag during the warm-up of North Korea's women's football match at Hampden Park.

The incident saw North Korea's players walk off the pitch in protest, before the glitch was fixed an hour later.

It is thought a video producer in London - who has since offered to resign - was at fault for the gaffe.

And just yesterday, Olympic programme producers referred to Welsh Team GB footballer Joe Allen as being English.

Organisers had anticipated about 1.5million people coming out to see the Torch Relay, but figures suggested it was closer to 3.9 million.

And the mayor, who won re-election ahead of the Games in May, said the palpable public enthusiasm for the Olympics was a huge opportunity for London.

'It is our chance to show the world what we are all about, our chance to throw a great party.

'There are very, very important economic reasons for trying to get the best out of the Games... I want to see great economic benefits from these Games.

'We have so many things going for us and the games is a chance... for us to show those things off and that is not unimportant.'

Mr Johnson said he would be watching as much sport as he could during meetings and events he attends in his capacity as London Mayor.

And he said tonight's Opening Ceremony would be a brilliant set-piece to launch the 16 days of competition.

He said: 'It's a long time since I saw Danny Boyle's rushes and I can't reveal, for those who don't know what's going to happen, the details.

'It was an absolutely brilliant piece of theatrical organisation. I think people are going to well up with hot tears of patriotic pride when they see this.'

As part of the celebrations, The bell on board the royal rowbarge Gloriana also pealed for three minutes as it processed down the Thames, carrying the Olympic flame and a ceremonial cauldron.

HMS Belfast fired its canons in a countdown to 8.12am as 300 children, sea cadets, brownies and Town Criers gather on board to ring an assortment of bells.

Others taking part include The Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, the British Army, the RAF, the National Trust, the National Theatre, the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers, the Royal British Legion and the Women’s Institute.

Tower Hamlets, one of six Olympics host boroughs, rang in the changes as one of its councillors joins a Pearly Queen of Bow for a ding-dong at the historic Bow Church.

The traditional Cockney welcome with Councillor Rania Khan was witnessed by the Rev Debbie Frazer, who is new at the church.

The full three-minute chime was 
broadcast on BBC Breakfast, BBC Radio 2 and every BBC local radio 
station across the UK, with a potential live audience of more than 10 
million people.

Bells rang everywhere from Britain’s 
northernmost inhabited house in Skaw in the Shetland Isles, to the UK’s 
most westerly church in Tresco in the Scilly Isles.

It aims to set a world record for the 
largest number of bells to be rung simultaneously and can include any 
from children with handbells, through people ringing bicycle bells and 
doorbells, to experienced change ringing experts of tower bells and 
church bells.

The ringing of Big Ben was attended by the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow MP, Lord Tony Hall, chair of the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad Board and bell ringers from a variety of organisations.
