A Michigan couple who have just welcomed their 12th son say they have not been trying for a girl during the past two decades.

Kateri and Jay Schwandt, who gave birth to their first son, Ty, while they were in college, brought home baby Tucker on Sunday August 4th, the 12th boy to enter the family.

'If we were going to have a girl, it would have happened by now,' Mrs Schwandt told the Charlotte Observer. You don't have 12 boys waiting for that girl.'

Lined-up: At home to welcome little Tucker was Tyler, 21, Zach, 17, Drew, 16, Brandon, 14, Tommy, 11, Vinny, ten, Calvin, eight, Gabe, six, Wesley, five and Charlie, three and Luke, nearly two

'We were getting ready to leave the hospital and I said, "Twelve. Twelve kids. That's crazy,"' recalled Mr Schwandt on the Today show. 'This is a pretty testosterone filled house!' 

As the only woman in the house, Mrs Schwandt is used to being outnumbered.

'I looked at my husband, and we 
exchanged a knowing smile. When they say it's a boy, I think, "OK, no 
problem. I've got this." We know what we're doing.'

While they say they 'gave up a long time ago on a little girl showing up in this family,' the couple would certainly welcome a daughter.

'We thought maybe, maybe, you know, we're going to have a girl. Number 12 could be the one,' admitted Mrs Schwandt.

Play time: The couple say their growing family was simply a happy accident; there was a four-year gap between 21-year-old Ty and 17-year-old Zach, and after that, a new baby brother arrived every year or two

The couple say their growing family was simply a happy accident.

'When we had Ty, we were in college at the time, and we thought let's have one more so Ty's not ten when he had a brother or sister,' said Mr Schwandt. 'And then little Zach came along, and the flood gates were kind of open.'
