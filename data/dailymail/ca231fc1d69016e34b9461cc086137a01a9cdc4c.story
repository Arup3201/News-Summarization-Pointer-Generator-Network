A former Olympic swimmer from South 
Africa was officially declared Princess Charlene of Monaco today 
following her marriage to Prince Albert.

Dressed in a sky-blue jacket and 
skirt, 33-year-old Charlene Wittstock smiled radiantly as she said ‘I 
do’ in a civil ceremony in the Royal Palace throne room of the ancient 
Mediterranean principality.

Her new husband, 53-year-old Albert, 
looked on proudly in a dark suit and grey tie as he put sensational 
rumours about his personal life behind him.

The French press even compared the 
nuptials to Britain’s Royal Wedding – while lamenting the fact that the 
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had sadly had to decline their invitation 
to Monte Carlo because they were on an official trip to Canada.

Less respectful Gallic commentators 
were, meanwhile, suggesting that history’s first Princess Charlene might
not have the same ring to it as Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.

Miss Wittstock had, in the words of 
Le Monde, ‘tried to escape’ last week  – back home to South Africa after
learning that Albert may have fathered a third love child.

As the mystery deepened, Albert’s two
love children and their mothers stayed away from today’s 40-minute 
ceremony at the Royal Palace.

They are also expected to be absent from the Catholic Church ceremony tomorrow.

Instead French President Nicolas 
Sarkozy is set to join celebrity guests including James Bond star Roger 
Moore, former supermodel Naomi Campbell, and veteran fashion designers 
Karl Lagerfeld and Giorgio Armani.

Princess Charlene today hit out at the rumours her wedding nearly fell apart over rumours of her husband's infidelity.

She told vogue.com: 'It is a shame that those rumours came at such a bad time, but I think they were timed to sabotage such a happy occasion.

'They are categorical lies. I won't dignify them with any response other than to say that the photographs of me and Albert in love and getting married will speak louder than any vicious gossip and empty rumours.'

The former swimmer compared her big day 
with competing in the pool and said it was no less challenging than 
diving into a freezing cold pool every morning as she trained for the 
Olympics.

And she talked about her wedding day 
outfit, a powder-blue corset, chiffon pleated palazzo pants and a powder
blue jacket decorated with tiny silver and pearl buttons, which she 
designed with Karl Lagerfeld.

'It is my creation and I'm proud of it. 
It's feminine and keeps with tradition yet has a little twist that 
reflects my personal style.

'I thought it was a nice change to go 
for trousers instead of a skirt, especially since I'm an athlete and 
have always kept my clothes clean and simple.'

Scandal: The preparations have been dogged by claims that Prince Albert had fathered a third love child

Organisers of the £55million 
celebrations surrounding the wedding – which included a concert by The 
Eagles last night – hope that it will rival the 1956 wedding of Albert’s
mother, Hollywood star Grace Kelly, and his father, Prince Rainier.

Philippe Narmino, president of 
Monaco’s Council of State, officiated today, and confirmed that the 
former Miss Wittstock was now officially a Princess.

Before the 5pm ceremony, Mr Narmino 
said: ‘It’s the event of my life. Me, who as a magistrate, has dealt 
with hundreds of divorce dossiers during 27 years, will be marrying a 
couple for the first time.

Referring to the Paris news magazine 
which broke the story about Charlene’s attempted flight, and which still
stands by it, Albert’s lawyer Thierry Lacoste said: ‘I heard everything
about the child – white, black, who has been born, not yet born - it 
has to stop, it’s I don’t know what.’

He said: ‘There is no child, it’s a 
totally false rumour and absolutely without foundation. It’s easy to do 
your job as a journalist – to check that Charlene did not go to the 
airport. It’s clearly false, she and the prince were around all last 
week.’

In fact a senior detective from 
Monaco, who was involved in the later stages of the ‘incident’ at Nice 
airport, has confirmed that ‘Charlene had her passport confiscated so 
that the Prince’s entourage could persuade her to stay’.

Albert already has two children - 
six-year-old Alexandre, the son of Nicole Coste, a former Air France air
hostess from Togo, and Jazmin, 19, whose mother is Tamara Rotola, an 
American estate agent.

Miss Coste was spotted in Monaco 
earlier this week, but was said to have been advised to stay away from 
the wedding to avoid ‘media exposure’.

Mr Lacoste infamously issued fierce denials before DNA tests proved Albert was the father of Alexandre and Tamara.

Despite his strong denial this time around, Mr Lacoste confirmed that he was taking no action against L’Express.

And Christophe Barbier, editor of 
L’Express and a close friend of French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, 
said the magazine had no intention of removing the story from its 
website, saying: ‘We stand by our information which was supplied by 
three different sources.’

Mr Barbier said it was important to 
give Charlene’s attempted return home publicity because of the ‘number 
of crowned heads and representatives of various states that are expected
at the marriage’.

Despite such enthusiastic 
predictions, the guest list for the wedding – which had been shrouded in
secrecy until today - revealed that many senior royals who had been 
expected to attend were not in fact coming.

Miss Wittstock, who was born in 
Zimbabwe and moved to South Africa as a child, met Albert during a 2000 
swimming competition in Monaco.

He has been an International Olympic 
Committee member since 1985 and competed in five Winter Olympics as part
of Monaco's bobsled team.

Until
now the name Charlene has been most commonly associated with Charlene 
Robinson, Kylie Minogue’s character in the Australian soap opera, 
Neighbours.
