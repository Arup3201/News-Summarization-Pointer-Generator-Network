Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles could soon be built in oil-rich Saudi Arabia as Middle Eastern demand for the luxury British-made vehicles grows.

The £1bn plan follows Jaguar Land Rover sales in the Middle East and North Africa increasing by more than 9per cent to 11,418 vehicles this year.

The move forms part of the car company's global expansion strategy that recently saw it complete a £1bn deal to build its vehicles in China.

One of the biggest car manufacturers in the UK, Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India-based Tata Motors, also plans to create an additional 4,500 production and manufacturing jobs in the UK over the next five years.

In demand: Sales of Jaguar Land Rover vehicles to the Middle East and North Africa have increased by more than 9 per cent to 11,418 vehicles so far this year

Hope for growth: Prime Minister David Cameron visited Jaguar Land Rover in Solihull earlier this week and highlighted the need for more engineers, mechanics and scientists to boost Britain's economy

Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Dr 
Speth said: ‘We are committed to further international partnerships to 
meet record demand for our highly sought after vehicles.

'The Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia is an attractive potential development option, 
complementing our existing advanced facilities in Britain and recent 
manufacturing plans to expand in other countries including India and 
China.’

Subject to a feasibility study, production could get underway within five years, with a letter of intent expected to be signed today with the Saudi Government in Riyadh.

Steve Fowler, editor-in-chief of motoring magazine Auto Express said; ‘This is a brilliant deal in the desert for Jaguar Land Rover. It’s a massive coup. And it could prove to be a masterstroke.’

Mr Fowler  said: ’Everyone is concentrating on emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil. But an awful lot of luxury cars are also  sold in the Middle East and it’s a growing market. It could be very lucrative.

The deal would present an opportunity for British workers to head out to Saudi Arabia to train local staff, although the company stresses it is not 'exporting British jobs abroad'.

Last month the firm announced that Jaguars and Land Rovers are to be built in China for the first time ever following a £1billion joint-venture deal with China’s sixth largest car-manufacturer Chery.

Sales of Jaguar Land Rover cars have 
already risen by 80 per cent in China  to more than 53,000 so far this 
year, having soared 60 per cent last year. Sales of the baby Evoque 
alone have topped 20,000.

The China deal  allows JLR  to build its Jaguar limousines, sports cars and upmarket Land Rover and Range Rover off-roaders there.

Jaguar Land Rover has just launched a new Range Rover and unveiled its new two-seater F-Type roadster – spiritual successor to the E-Type of the 1960s.

Last month the company announced a doubling of its second quarter pre-tax profits to £431million with sales up nearly a third.
