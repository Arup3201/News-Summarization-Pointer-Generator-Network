He's famous for his bons mots and his unerring ability to make even the most hardened of Labour supporters laugh.

Now Boris Johnson has proved that his way with words goes beyond newspaper columns and speeches after performing a version of Jessie J hit Bang Bang on live radio.

During an appearance on the Capital FM breakfast show, the Mayor of London was asked to step up to the mike by hosts Lisa Snowdon and Dave Berry - and gamely agreed. 

While the resulting version of the song might not win any prizes for vocal theatrics or even staying in tune, the hilarious attempt is likely to raise a smile.

Mr Johnson had agreed to appear on the show to discuss London's New Year's Eve fireworks but was soon drawn into a discussion about a recent performance by Jessie J.

After revealing that he's a fan of the odd Jessie J tune, Mr Johnson was asked to perform his own version, which, after being tweaked by producers, also included some Cher-style synthesiser.

The London mayor isn't the first guest to be asked to perform a cover version of the song - just last week, TV presenter Graham Norton was asked to do the same.

In tune: Boris Johnson sings along to Jessie J's Bang Bang during an appearance on Capital FM

Cover: Prior to belting out his version of Bang Bang, Mr Johnson admitted to a fondness for Jessie J

Normal service: Mr Johnson is more often to be found debating politics rather than singing

Singing sensations: Both Australia's Tony Abbott and President Obama have been known to sing in public

But unlike the TV star, Mr Johnson has form when it comes to singing toe-curlingly bad cover versions of classic songs.

Mr Johnson's best-known singing moment came during a busking competition in 2013, when, guitar in hand, he belted out a version of Bob Marley's Three Little Birds.

And Mr Johnson is in good company. Other politicians to let loose in public include President Obama, who belted out a few lines from Al Green's Let's Stay Together during his re-election campaign in 2012, and Vladimir Putin who sang Blueberry Hill at a charity fundraiser in St Petersburg in 2010.

Australian prime minister Tony Abbott is another fan of impromptu singalongs, singing along to Elvis Presley's Suspicious Minds during a 2012 radio appearance.
