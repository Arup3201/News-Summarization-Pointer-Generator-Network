Labour is to introduce a 'graduate tax' on the earnings of those who go to university.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said yesterday the system would be 'fairer' than tuition fees and would be introduced 'in the medium term' if Labour returns to power.

The National Union of Students proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £15,000, for a period of 20 years, with the highest earners paying higher rates.

Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000.

In 2011, it announced the policy as it sought to win over disaffected former Liberal Democrat voters angered by Nick Clegg reneging on a pledge to scrap fees and signing up to Coalition plans to allow institutions to charge up to £9,000 a year – triple the amount students paid previously.

The £6,000 cap is expected to be included in Labour's general election manifesto, but it is not clear how the party intends to meet such an expensive commitment.

Previously, Labour has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better-off students.

The party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees, leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost.

Mr Umunna, who is responsible for higher education policy, said introducing a full-scale graduate tax 'as soon as possible is my priority'.

'In the medium term, a graduate tax is the way to go. It's fairer, it's more progressive and it's the way you clear up the unsustainable financial mess that has been created by the current Government under their system,' the shadow business secretary said.

'They are going to have to make huge write-offs on the student loans that they have been giving to people to pay these trebled tuition fees and a graduate tax ultimately getting to that place as fast as possible is key.'

Mr Umunna insisted it was 'unacceptable' that students were being saddled with 'a huge heap of debt'.

'The reason it has taken us some time to finalise our policy is because the ground has moved from us on this issue,' he said.

'The estimate on what students would be able to repay keeps falling in terms of what they expect to get back. That changes the figures.

'We will be announcing the policy on this before the election campaign. We are not going to erect a road-block to people's aspirations, as this Government has.' Labour first introduced tuition fees in September 1998, with students expected to pay up to £1,000 a year. The fees were then increased to £3,000 a year during Labour's second term in January 2004.

According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, students now graduate with an average of £44,035 of debt. Repayments only begin when their earnings rise above £21,000 a year.Business Secretary Vince Cable said the damage suffered by his party after its U-turn on tuition fees was a 'price worth paying', as the latest figures showed a record number of teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are applying to university.

The Lib Dem minister hailed a further narrowing of the gap between the number of rich and poor students wanting to go on to higher education. Mr Cable said the controversial move to treble tuition fees to a maximum of £9,000 has not deterred poorer students from applying.

He added: 'The opposite has occurred; numbers have grown, in particular those from disadvantaged backgrounds.'

Mr Cable described the new system as 'better, affordable and fair'.

He said: 'We have paid a price for this policy more than any other party. But the success of these reforms, with more students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to university than ever before, shows it was a price worth paying.

'Regardless of family circumstances, all students can now obtain university level education as long as they meet academic requirements. This is a good legacy.'

The figures, from university admissions service Ucas, show 21 per cent of 18-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds in England applied this year.

Overall, the richest 18-year-olds in the UK are 2.4 times more likely to want to go to university than the poorest. But in 2006, when Labour was in power, the wealthiest were 3.7 times more likely to want to apply.

Gordon Brown will play a major role in Labour's general election campaign in a bid to prevent wipeout in Scotland, party sources said. Ed Miliband has been rocked by a series of polls suggesting Labour could lose almost all of its 40 seats to the SNP. Mr Brown, who is stepping down as an MP, is widely credited with reinvigorating the Better Together campaign ahead of last year's Scottish independence referendum.

A Scottish Labour source said of the former prime minister: 'Gordon is our ace card.'

He has often been the butt of a few jokes, so Ed Miliband probably enjoyed being the comedian himself for once. But whether his audience of political journalists did this week wasn't clear.

Here are some of the jokes he delivered in his speech on Thursday at the event inspired by the White House Correspondents' Dinner – famous for its light-hearted speech by the President.
