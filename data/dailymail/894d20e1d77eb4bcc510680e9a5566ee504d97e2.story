Contributing editor: Pippa Middleton has landed a new job as a Vanity Fair writer

Pippa Middleton has landed a new job as a Vanity Fair contributing editor.

In her first editorial for the glossy title, the 29-year-old sister of the Duchess of Cambridge writes about her most memorable experiences at Wimbledon.

It is a second regular magazine job for the aspiring lifestyle guru, which she will write in addition to her monthly Friday Night Feasts column in Waitrose Magazine.  It follows the publication of her first book, Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities for Family and Friends, last year.

Published ahead of Wimbledon this 
year, the article sees Pippa describe the tournament as 'the highlight 
of my summer', and recalls her first visit to the All England Club at the age of eight.

She says that she was an 
aspiring professional tennis player at the time, and remembers purchasing a postcard of the 
women's championship trophy and writing on it: 'I will win this one day.'

She admits that as a child, she imagined she would get married in tennis whites, 'shorts with no pleats or frills.'

Pippa, who is dating stockbroker Nico 
Jackson, 35, tells readers that she has now grown out of her tomboy 
phase, but that said, there will still be 'no white dresses this summer,
 apart from at my local tennis club.'

She says a favourite Wimbledon memory 
was queuing with her sister on People's Sunday in 2004 to get £35 
tickets for Centre Court - something that would be highly unlikely - and
 indeed unnecessary for them today.

She also remembers how her father embarrassed her during a match between Tim Henman and Pete Sampras.

'We were sitting quite close to the 
players' court entrance,' she recalled. 'When Tim Henman walked onto the
 court, the crowd cheered him, and as he walked near our seats my dad 
mistakenly yelled, "Come on Pete!" That was embarrassing.

 apart from at my local tennis club'

Pippa,
 who remains a regular at Wimbledon, and is frequently
 photographed alongside her sister in prime 
seats on Centre Court, further hones her reputation as a lifestyle guru 
offering advice to Wimbledon-goers, from strategies on beating 
the traffic, to new British tennis talent to look out for.

She advises readers to prepare for 
the weather: 'Bring everything from sunblock and sunglasses to a 
mackintosh and umbrella,' she writes.

She also suggests leaving the stilettos at home, and to walk, cycle or share a taxi to the grounds.

And steer clear of making plans afterwards, she warns, as play can go on well into the evening.

'There's nothing worse than having to leave Rafael Nadal's athleticism for a routine pizza with friends,' she writes.

Friends in high places: Vanity Fair has no less than 88 contributing editors on its masthead

As a contributing editor, Pippa joins a lengthy yet illustrious list of names on the Vanity Fair masthead.

There are no less than 88 names on the list in the new July issue, among them the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer of Friday Night Lights, Buzz Bissinger and former White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers.

One-time Interview magazine editor-in-chief Ingrid Sischy, who wrote this month's long-awaited interview with John Galliano, also features, as does author and social commentator Fran Lebowitz.

Prominent writers Christopher Tennant, Nancy-Jo Sales and Sebastian Junger are listed as contributors to the magazine too, as well as Carl Bernstein, famous, in particular, for his reporting of the Watergate scandal in the Seventies.

Nor is she the only society name on the list. Among the impressive line-up are Reinaldo Herrera, husband of fashion designer Carolina and holder of the Spanish title of The 5th Marqués of Torre Casa. His name appears alongside that of fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and veteran society photographer Patrick McMullan.
