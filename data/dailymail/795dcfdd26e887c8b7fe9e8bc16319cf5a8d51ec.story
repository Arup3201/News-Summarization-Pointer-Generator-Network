This footage shows the incredible moment a thief appears to hypnotise a shopkeeper before rifling through his pockets while he is in a trance.

The man, who is believed to be Eastern European, walked into the shop in Highgate, north London, and claimed his wife was pregnant and needed water.

He can be seen touching shopkeeper, Aftab Haider, on the stomach to demonstrate his wife's baby bump, before the man falls into what appears to be a trance-like state.

This is the moment a brazen thief walked into a shop in Highgate, north London, and speaks to the owner

 Mr Haider, 56, who runs Hops'n'Pops off licence, only comes to after the thief has rummaged through his pockets and made off with the contents during the bizarre incident on September 11. 

The 45 second heist is believed to be the first time the crime, which has been reported in Nigeria, India and Italy, has been filmed in Britain.

Mr Haider said: 'I’m so upset about what happened. It’s hard to talk about but I want to help stop this happening to other shopkeepers.

'It was late and I was tired, I’m not sure but it was like I was hypnotised.

'He said his wife was in trouble and needed someone to help her.

'While he was touching me he took all the money from my right hand side, which had my float money, and all the money from my left.

'He was touching my stomach saying "my wife is pregnant" - it’s an old trick of the professionals.

'I was thinking, what should I give to him? Maybe he wanted water, tonic water?

'I feel really shocked by it. I thought, "why is he touching me?" But by that time it was too late.'

The man can be seen talking to the shopkeeper where he claims that his wife is pregnant and needs water

The footage shows the man, who is believed to be Eastern European, touching the shopkeeper's stomach

His wife, Paula, said: 'His friend was outside and couldn’t believe he was allowing him to touch him like that.

'He thought maybe they were friends or maybe he had some sort of hypnotic powers over him.

'I feel like we were targeted I saw a few people hanging around the shop a few days before.'

Hypnotherapist, Trevor Hoskisson, told MailOnline: 'If someone is naturally very highly hypnotisable it would be possible to do something like this. 

'The thief, in this case, would probably have visited the shop a few days or weeks earlier to assess the level of hypnotisability of the shop keeper and to observe how the takings are handled.

'It's extremely rare in the UK for a crime to be committed using hypnosis but strangely, in Italy, there are about half a dozen crimes committed like this each year.  

'As a general principle you cannot get anyone to do anything against their will using hypnosis and far from being a circus act or means to commit crime, it is a highly therapeutic tool.' 

Jack Raymond, a hypnotherapist based in London, was more sceptical and said: 'Pickpockets distract their victims constantly and this guy has learnt a technique and stuck to it.

'What he is saying will be important as well as the motions. The touching of the stomach meant that he didn't notice when he put his hands in his pockets.

He is attempting to demonstrate his wife's condition but it appears that the shopkeeper falls into a trance

He then rummages through the man's pockets, taking what he can, before making off down Archway Road

'We go into trances all the time - when we're watching television, reading books, when we're half asleep in the morning. It's about turning off the attention centre in the brain.'

But Mr Raymond made it clear that the thief is no Derren Brown and added: 'It's similar to someone who learns one thing and can do it well, but the whole point is he was distracting.'

Officers investigating the theft described it as an 'elaborate stage act' which they have never seen used anywhere else in the UK. 

They have now released the CCTV from the off licence on Archway Road in a bid to track down the thief.

Detective Sergeant Dave Bullock, Serious Acquisitive Crime Unit in Haringey, said: 'The victim in this incident said that he was momentarily unaware of what had happened to him.

'The suspect's distraction tactics appeared to have worked as he robbed the victim of cash from his pocket. 

'If anyone recognises the suspect or has been a victim in similar circumstances, please contact us.'

Scotland Yard said: 'On Thursday, September 11 at approximately 9.45pm the suspect entered a shop in Archway Road and told the owner that his wife was pregnant and she needed some bottled water.

The shopkeeper only appears to come to once the man has already made his way out of the front door

'The suspect touched the stomach area of the victim to imitate his wife's condition.

'The suspect is then seen to take a quantity of cash out of the victim's pockets as the victim remained motionless and unable to stop the robbery taking place.

'The suspect is described as approximately 30-35 years old, of Eastern European appearance, around 5ft 8ins tall, of slim build, with short black hair, wearing dark jeans, a grey polo shirt, a black bomber jacket with small white writing on the back just below the collar.'

Anyone with information should call police on 020 3276 3158 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
