An American salesman has eaten 12,000 Big Macs over the last 30 years - and yet appears to be healthy.

Dennis Rosinlof says he eats the McDonald’s burger with fries ten times a week - sometimes twice a day - on his travels, and only takes a break on Sundays.

But despite having a fondness for the 930 calorie Big Mac meal, Mr Rosinlof is actually a slim 165lbs and healthy.

Big Mac-aholic: Dennis Rosinlof has eaten 12,000 McDonald's Big Macs in 30 years, but is apparently healthy

Addicted: Dennis Rosinlof's first meal of the day is a Big Mac at 10.30am when McDonald's opens

He is 64, six feet tall, weighs 11-and-a-half stone and has a good cholesterol level.

Mr Rosinlof said: ‘Conservatively, I’ve eaten at least 12,000 Big Macs over the last 30 years.

‘I don’t get tired of it. I look forward to going to McDonald’s every single time.’

Mr Roslinof described the Big Mac as a ‘fantastic sandwich’ and said that he starts the week off on Mondays with one of the burgers on his way home from work.

He eats two on Tuesday - one on the way into work then one on the way home - and one on Wednesday for breakfast.

On Thursdays he will eat two Big Macs, two on Fridays and always two on Saturdays.

His only break is on Sundays when his wife Lauri, 37, cooks him and his family a meal.

Consistent: Forget the nuggets or Filets-O-Fish, Dennis Rosinlof loves Big Macs, saying 'It tastes good, so I order the same thing every day.'

Mr Rosinlof said: ‘My first meal of the day is always about 10.30am when they open up the Big Macs.

‘I enjoy what I eat and it tastes good so I get the same thing every day’.

The former Vietnam army medic is a salesman at a home furnishings company based in Salt Lake City, Utah.

His wife is a registered nurse and has tried to urge him to eat more healthily but given he is in good health they have let him be.

Mr Rosinlof said: ‘I think part of it has to do with calories.

'A Big Mac meal is 930 calories. Two of them is 1,860 so I’m still under 2,000 calories a day even when I eat twice a day, but I don’t eat a whole lot more than that.

‘I don’t think I’m addicted to Big Macs but my body understands what’s coming when it’s coming and knows what it has to make to get to get rid of it.

‘I think that might be one reason why Big Macs and I get along so well.’

Dietician David Zinczenko said that Mr Roslinof was staying thin because he stayed within his daily calorie intake, even if he was doing it in a rather unconventional manner.

He said: ‘What’s missing from his diet are vitamins’.
