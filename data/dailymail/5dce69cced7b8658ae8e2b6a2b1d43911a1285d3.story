French President Francois Hollande, pictured, will meet with Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt for talks tomorrow

The executive chairman of internet giant Google is to meet with French President Francois Hollande tomorrow for talks over a bill that would force search engines to pay for content, according to a government source.

Eric Schmidt will also meet with French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti before meeting with Mr Hollande, said the anonymous source.

The meeting follows threats from Google that it would exclude French media sites from its search results if the country's government passes the bill.

Google sent letters to several French ministerial offices earlier this month saying that it 'cannot accept' such a move and that the company 'as a consequence would be required to no longer reference French sites', according to a copy of the letter obtained by news agency AFP.

The company said that a law which would require it to pay media sites for displaying links to their content would 'threaten (Google's) very existence'.

Top French newspaper publishers last month called on the government to adopt a law imposing a settlement in the long-running row with Google, forcing it to share some of the advertising revenue from user searches for news contained on media websites.

That call came after politicians in Germany approved a draft legislation back in August that would see search engines pay commissions to German media sites.

Culture Minister Filippetti said she was in favour of the idea last week, describing it as 'a tool that it seems important to me to develop.'

Surprised by the tone of the letter from Google, she said: 'You don't deal with a democratically-elected government with threats.'
