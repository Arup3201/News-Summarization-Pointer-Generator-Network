The neat box hedges of the classic English garden could be devastated by disease this summer, experts warned.

The wettest winter on record created ideal conditions for box blight, a fungal disease that turns leaves brown.

Affected hedges usually have to be ripped out.

Blighted: The normally verdant countryside could become brown if expert fears for a fungal disease is realised

Last year’s wet weather had already caused record levels of the blight, according to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS).

A thing of the past? Blight could devastate the countryside because of the wettest winter on record

And the problem is set to get worse, with the two forms of the disease, Cylindrocladium buxi and Volutella buxi, flourishing.

Dr John David, the RHS’s chief scientist, said it had seen more inquiries about box blight so far in 2014 than in the same period last year.

He added: ‘We believe this is mostly due to problems left over from mild, wet conditions we experienced in 2013.

'Although the extent of any problem won’t become clear until after April, when the weather heats up . . . the RHS believes the likelihood is that box blight will continue to be a common problem in 2014.’ 

The RHS list of the most common garden diseases for 2013, to be published on Monday, reveals inquiries about box blight were at their highest since the society began keeping records in 1996.

The two forms of blight were fourth and fifth on the list, up from sixth and eighth in 2012. 

For the 18th year, honey fungus, which attacks the roots of perennial plants, was the top disease.

Leaf spots, mildews and root rots were also common.

Box blight was found in 1994 at a Hampshire nursery and has spread across the home counties.

Recently, the National Trust had to remove all the box at Buckland Abbey, in Devon, and replant with Japanese holly. 

Alternatives to box are hebe, box-leaved holly and boxleaf honeysuckle.
