Women are not allowed to serve in ground close combat roles, but the ban could now be reviewed earlier than planned

Women could be rushed into frontline combat roles to plug gaps in the armed forces, a Defence Minister has suggested.

The government is ‘seriously’ considering bringing forward a review into lifting the ban on female personnel serving in combat roles due in 2018.

Tory minister Lord Astor said it could be held earlier to improve the diversity of the forces ‘maintain operational effectiveness’ at a time of spending cuts.

Britain is lagging behind other major countries in refusing to allow women to serve in in the Army, Navy and RAF in ground close combat roles on the frontline.

Australia will open all units to women at the beginning of 2016, and the US last year removed its official ban on women in combat roles.

Under EU law, the UK government must review the ban by 2018.

But speaking in the House of Lords, Lord Astor revealed the decision could be made much earlier to help the forces cope with reduce troop numbers.

He told peers: ‘While the nature, scope and timing of the review have not yet been determined, we are considering whether to bring it forward, recognising the need both to improve the diversity of the workforce across defence and to maintain operational effectiveness.’

Previous reviews in 2002 and 2010 recommended women continue to be banned from the frontline.

But Lord Astor said: ‘We are reviewing seriously a date earlier than November 2018.

‘The Ministry of Defence remains fully committed to treating everyone fairly and properly, whatever their gender, ethnicity or other characteristic. We will continue working to eliminate any form of discrimination.’

Women can currently serve as engineers, intelligence officers, medics, fighter pilots and dog handlers.

At the weekend it emerged three women have made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy.

Lieutenants Maxine Stiles, Alexandra Olsson and Penny Thackray have completed months of specialised training to earn their ‘Dolphins’ – the clasp worn by qualified submariners – becoming the first women in the 110-year history of the Navy's Submarine Service.

But during a debate in the House of Lords there were cross-party calls to go further and allow women to serve in combat roles.

Tory peer Lord Selkirk, a minister in the Thatcher and Major governments, said: ‘If women have the inclination, aptitude, ability and strength required, is it not time for the Government to consider following the examples of such countries as Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and, not least, the United States of America, all of which either have allowed women to take their place in combat roles on the front line or are in the process of doing so?’

Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall said allowing women into combat roles is 'something that we need to be considering seriously'

Labour defence spokesman Lord Rosser said: ‘Serious consideration needs to be given to the further roles that women can play, including serving in front-line combat, since we need to maximise the talent and expertise available.’

Last month the head of the Army said suggested women should be allowed to fight in combat roles.

Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall raised the prospect that the Army may ease its last restrictions on women taking their place in front-line fighting.

He told the Army’s Soldier magazine: ‘We are in a minority of armies now in that respect.

‘It’s definitely something that we need to be considering seriously but we need to go about this with great care, especially with all the other changes going on.

‘This isn’t just about getting more females into the 30 per cent of roles that are combat trades but getting more of them into the Army.’

Troop numbers are to be cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, with the shortfall to be made up by the recruitment of 35,000 reservists.

The Army currently has 7,500 women soldiers, who serve with the artillery and engineers in front-line roles.

Women fly as fighter pilots as well as taking more traditional female duties as medics and intelligence officers.
