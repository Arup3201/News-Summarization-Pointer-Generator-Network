Where can you find Captain America, Hawkeye, Poison Ivy, assorted X-Men and even Pikachu all getting together for a party?

New York Comic Con opened last night, and fan boys and girls from far and wide came together to celebrate their favourite comic book characters - in the obligatory fancy dress, of course.

With over 100,000 visitors expected, the event is one of the largest pop culture conventions in the U.S. - second only to the mammoth Comic Con San Diego.Â

'San Diego was the arena rock show; New York is the acoustic show,' Jeremy Corray, creative director at World Events Productions, told the New York Times.

Mr Corray was making his first visit to the New York event this year to promote Voltron: The Defender Of The Universe, an animated series from the Eighties.

He added that while the San Diego event has become an entertainment behemoth, New York's equivalent is 'more focused and manageable' for the business visitor.

Nevertheless, Comic Con New York has 
gone from strength to strength in recent years, with last year's show 
attracting 96,000 visitors - ranking it the city's second largest even, 
according to Crain's New York Business.

Held at the Jacob Javits Centre in midtown Manhattan, the event has fast established itself as the east coast's premier comic book convention.

With Batman, Joker, Captain Kirk, The Avengers and many industry legends including Stan Lee making an appearance, the bash is a fan's fantasy.

But it is also an important industry event which gives professionals the chance to network, share ideas, and test new concepts.

Lucasfilm will be there to promote Red Tails, its new movie inspired by the Tuskegee airmen, alongside Marvel, which will reveal new clips from The Avengers, its eagerly anticipated summer blockbuster.

Marvel is also promoting an appearance by comic book legend Stan Lee, the comic company's former publisher and co-creator of many its best-known characters.

Mike Pasciullo, Marvel's senior vice president of brand planning and communications, told the New York Times that dialogue between fans and creator's is 'part of the DNA' of the company.

'Since the early days of Stan Lee, Marvel has always been about community. We want to make sure it stays that way,' he said.

Other companies attending include cult toy maker Hasbro and video game developer Capcom, the company behind the iconic Street Fighter series.
