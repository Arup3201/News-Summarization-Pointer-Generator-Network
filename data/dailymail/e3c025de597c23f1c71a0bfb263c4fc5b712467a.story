The battle for Chelsea's No 1 jersey has started to heat up, with Petr Cech stating that he has no intention of sitting on the bench this season.

With Thibaut Courtois returning to Stamford Bridge this season following three years at Atletico Madrid, Jose Mourinho will soon face a real headache over selection.

He has at his disposal two of the finest keepers in Europe, with Cech being Chelsea's undisputed No 1 for a decade, and Courtois emerging as the best young stopper in Europe during his time in Spain.VIDEO Scroll down to see Thibaut Courtois lauded by Belgium fans at music festival

And with Courtois soon set to join up with the squad following his World Cup travails with Belgium, Cech has set his stall out early.

'I don't want to be on the bench,' he said, after Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Austrian side Wolgsberger during pre-season. 'This is why I am trying to do everything to be in the team.

'I don't want to talk about ifs and buts. Let's see how I am going and what happens.

'You know I
 always give my best and obviously that is all I can do. I will do my 
best and do everything I can do to be as ready as possible for when the 
season starts.

'Obviously
 Jose Mourinho will make his choice and decide how his team is going to 
look for the first game, second game, third game, whatever game.

'It
 is up to us players to show we are ready to play and make him pick us. I
 am not any different. I am doing everything I can to make him pick me.'

Although it leaves Mourinho with a difficult call to make, he has claimed he is happy with the circumstance he has found himself in.

‘My situation for the season is fantastic,’ said Mourinho. ‘To have Cech and Courtois, the best young goalkeeper in the world and one of the top three or five experienced keepers, for me and Chelsea it’s perfect.

‘There’s no story. One will play and Chelsea will be in safe hands for good because both are very good players.’

When it was then pointed out to Mourinho that one would be left unhappy, he said: ‘But the Chelsea supporters will be happy and they’re more important than players.

'If supporters have Cech or Courtois they will be happy because they know we’re in safe hands.'
