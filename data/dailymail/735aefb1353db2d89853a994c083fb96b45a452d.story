The builder who refused to abandon his million-pound home to the floods, and instead constructed his own defences, has successfully kept the deluge at bay - as water levels begin to drop.

Sam Notaro became a latter-day King Canute after protecting his property from the water which engulfed the Somerset Levels.

The 40 year-old father-of-two triumphed over the elements with a seven-foot high mud dam around his four-bedroom home in Moorland, Somerset.

Along with a team of family and friends, they worked around the clock to ensure that the property he built stayed dry.

He now says that almost four weeks after he began his battle against the rising waters he feels he has won.

Mr Notaro, who lives in Moorland, Somerset, said that he could now start getting back into a normal routine after the water had dropped by more than 18 inches.

He said: 'We've done as much as we can do so now it's just time to sit back and relax really. The waters have now dropped a little bit. In the past week it has gone down about 18 inches.

'There is still about three and a half feet of water left on the drive still but fingers crossed it'll continue to go down as it has been. I feel like I can finally start going back to normal life - I'm back at work again now as well which is a bit of a relief.

'Obviously
 we aren't really worried about the water coming up over the barriers 
any more because the levels have stopped rising. The only concern now would be if the barriers broke, because obviously they are still holding back quite a lot of water.

'Thankfully that doesn't look like that will happen - it is looking strong and there aren't any cracks or anything.

Relaxed: Since the waters have fallen Mr Notaro says his only concern is the huge mud barriers breaking

'We've still got the pumps running every now and again just to make sure none of the last dregs of water get in the house. It's looking positive though.'

When flood waters started creeping towards his home, the builder used all of his resources to create a mud barrier surrounding the property.

He wrapped the base of the house in polythene in an attempt to stop any rainwater soaking through the bricks.

A series of pumps were also in action to remove any water breaching his blockade.

Mr
 Notaro evacuated his partner Alana O'Dell, 31, and their two children, 
who are 18 months old and 20 weeks old, at the start of his battle.

He said that although the water is still too high to move them back into the home he hopes it won't be long.

Mr
 Notaro said: 'I haven't moved my partner and kids back in just yet, 
obviously we still need to use a boat to get in and out so it isn't 
really practical for them to be here.

'I
 have managed to get out and go and see them though which was fantastic.
 They're doing alright, they knew I had to stay here and protect the 
house.'

Sam began building his treasured home just two and a half years ago after purchasing the four-acre plot - the highest point in Moorland.

It was built on a spot which, according to records, has never been previously flooded - a claim which Mr Notaro can proudly maintain.

Though he has managed to keep the water out of the impressive property he says that they will still have a lot of work to do once the water disappears.

He said: 'Hopefully, if the weather stays relatively dry, the water will disappear completely and normal life can be resumed.

'Obviously the hard work has paid off and the inside of the house is still dry but we will still have a clean up operation after.

'We will have to redo the garden and get a new driveway. There is still a lot to do but at least we're not having to do anything on the inside of the house either.'
