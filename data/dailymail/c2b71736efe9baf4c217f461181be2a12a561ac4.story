Troubled sleepers can rest easy in a new hotel room which allows customers to sleep under the stars in the comfort of their bed.  

A 'secret technique' has been used to create the stunning ‘Night Sky’ at a dozen Travelodge hotels across the country.

Each bespoke cosmic panorama has been created by artist Carl Marshall and his colleague who spent around three hours artistically transforming a standard white ceiling into a cosmic sky by hand painting individual shooting stars, milky ways and constellations of twinkling stars.

During the day, the ceilings look plain white but in darkness the stars appear to twinkle and the dust clouds seem to move mysteriously.

Whilst the three dimensional effect of the ceiling also appears to fall towards the bed by around three feet, creating a sense of immersion.

Carl Marshall created the ceiling by working in the dark wearing a UV headlight.

He covered the ceiling with a base layer of special light-activated paint then used glow-in-the-dark paint that glows blue, green and aqua to add dust clouds, stars and their tails.

The paintworks soaks up light during the daylight hours and glows in darkness.

Mr Marshall from Euxton, Lancashire said: 'The exact technique I use is a closely guarded trade secret because it is so effective.

'It is a painstaking process as you have to position the colours perfectly to achieve a three-dimensional effect but the results are definitely worth it.

'The stars twinkle and the dust clouds appear to move as you lie in bed looking at it.

'Everybody is blown away by it when they see it and my children think it is amazing.'    

Travelodge created the UK’s first night sky panorama hotel rooms in response to findings from its latest sleep study which investigated the nation’s most desirable sleeping locations.

Key findings from the study revealed the most desired kipping location for Britons is under a blanket of twinkling stars.

Forty two per cent of adults choose a starry night sky backdrop as their most desired sleeping location in contrast to a tropical beach, rainforest and jungle.   

Sleeping by the sea was the second most popular desired kipping spot for Britons followed by a sandy beach in third place.

Whilst four out of ten adults reported gazing up at a starry sky puts them in a romantic mood.           

Shakila Ahmed, Travelodge spokesman said: 'As part of our commitment in helping to ensure our customers attain a good night’s sleep, we are constantly looking at innovative sleep aids.

'Therefore in response to our latest sleep study, which highlighted Britons most desirable place to nod off is under a blanket of stars, we took the challenge and created the ultimate outdoor sleeping experience indoors.

Now our customers can gaze into a cosmic night sky of shooting stars, milky ways and constellations of twinkling stars from the comfort of their warm cosy bed.'

Neil Shah, Founder of The Stress Management Society said: 'The Travelodge night sky room is a great concept to help you de-stress after a long day.

There are no extra costs for a night under the stars with prices starting from £21 per night.

Top vote: Those questioned said they would be able to sleep best under a starry sky

'Focusing on something, such as a sky full of stars, which the brain is unable to consciously analyse or tune into, encourages our minds to switch off and drift into a stress free deep sleep.'

Chris Idzikowski, Director of Edinburgh Sleep Centre, added: 'This new innovation can help towards attaining a good night’s sleep. The way it works supports our natural sleep / wake cycle.

'In darkness our brain’s (pineal gland) releases melatonin, the hormone of darkness which supports sleep. Whilst dawn light is very important for keeping the biological clock ticking to the right time.

'The Travelodge night sky room replicates the natural environment which our ancestors would have experienced in the savannah grasslands during the evolution of human sleep patterns.'
