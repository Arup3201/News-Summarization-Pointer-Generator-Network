The lives of one out of two Britons are so hectic they never have time for a lie-in, according to a survey.

More men than women - 49 per cent compared with 41 per cent - complained they don’t have lazy mornings.

With the prospect of an extra hour in bed when the clocks go back this weekend, the poll found that only a quarter ‘regularly’ or ‘always’ sleep through the night.

Rarity: 49 per cent of women surveyed complained that they don't have lazy mornings

When asked how often they had a lie-in, 44 per cent of those polled said they 'never' enjoyed one.

People in Northern Ireland have the most lie-ins, followed by the South East and Scotland, while those in the South West have the fewest.

Parents may not be surprised to hear that people aged 16 to 24 have more lie-ins than other age group while those aged 55 and over miss out the most.

Although many Britons would like more sleep, 48 per cent said they were unwilling to give up anything to spend longer in bed.

Just nine per cent said they were prepared to spend less time with friends, four per cent less time with loved ones and two per cent less time with their children.

One in five would sacrifice watching their favourite TV shows, 15 per cent 'pampering' time and 3 per cent part of their salary for extra sleep.

Troubled: The survey of more than 2,000 people suggested that quality of sleep is an issue for many

The survey of 2,044 UK adults also suggests that quality of sleep is an issue for many, with just a quarter either either 'regularly' or 'always' sleeping through the night.

In contrast, 42 per cent wake in the middle of the night, 30 per cent toss and turn most nights and 29 percent take a long time to nod off.

Furthermore, almost a quarter said they tended to wake too early.

But it seems people still turn to traditional methods when they need to get to sleep.

Reading a book was the most popular choice, followed by listening to music and herbal remedies, while counting sheep was fifth.

Twice as many men (31 per cent) than women (16 per cent) said they never did anything to help them drop off at night.

Dr Nerina Ramlakhan, Silentnight’s sleep expert and a sleep therapist at Capio Nightingale Hospital, said: 'Many people are simply too busy these days to enjoy a lie in, so it’s hardly surprising that almost half of us never get to treat ourselves.

'Although a good night’s sleep is clearly a problem for many people, only a minority are prepared to sacrifice doing other things to get it, whether that’s spending time with people close to them or even watching their favourite TV shows.

'But sleep deprivation can have a huge impact on people’s lives so it’s important they evaluate their lifestyle to ensure they are not burning the candle at both ends - getting enough sleep is important for everyone’s well-being.'
