Jauntily waving a Union flag and happily demonstrating the perfect curtsey, a very patriotic fan was waiting for the Queen as she visited Reed's School in Cobham this morning.

But this was no average well-wisher: Instead, the Queen was greeted by a robot Royal enthusiast made by pupils at the school.

Despite being unable to offer much in the way of small talk, the 2ft robot certainly seemed to get the royal seal of approval, as the Queen looked on, apparently fascinated by its antics.

Greeting: The Queen beams as she arrives at Reed's School to find a patriotic row of Union Jack waving pupils

Happily for pupils, the robot wasn't the only member of the school to receive a smile from the monarch.

Arriving at the school, of which she is patron, Her Majesty was greeted by a sea of cheering pupils, all giving the robot a run for its money in the flag-waving stakes.

Later, after meeting students, the Queen was given a tour of the science department, inspecting the projects on display and chatting to pupils.

Reed's School, of which the Queen is patron, is celebrating its bicentary this year and was founded in 1813 in the east end of London as the London Orphan Asylum.

Approval: The Queen appears pleased with the row of royal robots she encountered during the visit

All smiles: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh both looked in fine fettle as they arrived at the school

Good day: The Queen is patron of Reed's School and certainly appeared to enjoy chatting with pupils

For the visit, the monarch was joined for the visit by the Duke of Edinburgh who looked in fine fettle as he toured the premises, despite a recent run of bad health.

The Queen herself looked typically elegant in a neat pearl-grey tweed suit, worn with a matching hat and a chic diamond brooch, as well as her trademark Launer handbag.

And the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh weren't the only Royals to be spotted devoting time to good causes today.

Prince Harry spent the morning playing volleyball with a group of disabled athletes as he helped to launch the Invictus Games at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford.

Inspection: A group of pupils explain the inner workings of their science projects to the Queen

What's that all about? A pupil gives the Queen a science lesson with the help of a few props

The Invictus Games are a new international sporting event for wounded, injured and sick members of the Armed Forces, and during the launch, the Prince called for people to set aside personal beliefs about the conflict in Afghanistan and support casualties of war.

Harry has been working behind the scenes to bring the Games to London since last year, when he attended the US equivalent, the Warrior Games, during a visit to the country.

Nations that are scheduled to participate in the Invictus Games include Germany, New Zealand, Italy, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Speaking at the event, the Prince said: 'We are drawing down from Afghanistan and people will forget this because something else will come into the news. Look at the news, see how busy the world is at the moment.'

'It's not about supporting the conflict in Afghanistan, it's not about supporting war, it's not about supporting the forces themselves.....just come along and show your support.'

Important: Prince Harry launched the Invictus Games for injured servicemen at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park

Message: He called on people to support wounded soldiers regardless of their political views
