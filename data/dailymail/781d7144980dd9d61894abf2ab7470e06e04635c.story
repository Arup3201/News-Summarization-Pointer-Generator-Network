Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio

The judge in Drew Peterson's murder trial considered today whether to declare a mistrial after blasting prosecutors for a second time in less than two days for bringing up information he said could prejudice the jury.

A furious Judge Edward Burmila sent jurors out of the courtroom before grilling prosecutor Kathleen Patton for allowing a witness to mention a bullet and leave the impression that Peterson left it in the witness' driveway.

Burmila then took a recess to allow defense attorneys to file a motion for mistrial.

'It can't be reckless, it is intentional,' Peterson attorney Steve Greenberg told the judge when court reconvened, arguing that prosecutors violated court orders.

The former cop was charged in the 2004 death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, after his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, went missing in 2007.

Drew Peterson is suspected in her disappearance but hasn't been charged.

Patton said prosecutors didn't deliberately try to get the witness, former Peterson neighbor Thomas Pontarelli, to mention that he found the .38-caliber bullet on his driveway.

The judge appeared close to declaring a mistrial yesterday after a prosecutor began to discuss an allegation that Peterson once tried to hire a hit man.

Prosecutors contend Peterson killed Savio and tried to make it look like an accident.

Defense attorney Joel Brodsky told jurors repeatedly during his opening statement that there was no evidence Savio's death was anything but a tragic accident.

It appears the drama surroundnig Peterson's life and his arrest is due to continue in the courtroom.

His defense attorney's argued yesterday that Peterson was a victim of a 24-hour news cycle and cable TV's talking heads, which together created a media frenzy that did not subside until prosecutors had charged an innocent man.

Prosecutors: Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told the court during opening statements that Peterson killed his wife and made it look like an accident

Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told jurors that Peterson, 58, killed Savio, 40, and made it look like an accident.

'Just weeks before her death, he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension,' Glasgow said during opening statements.

Peterson's real-life drama inspired a TV movie and a national spotlight was put on the case, as many speculated whether Peterson used his law-enforcement expertise to get away with Savio's murder and make 23-year-old Stacy Peterson vanish.

The first witness in the trial - Savio's close friend and next-door neighbor Mary Pontarelli - was called yesterday.

She cried as she was shown a picture of Savio lying lifeless in her bathtub before describing the moment she found her body in March 2004.

Mrs Pontarelli told the court she and her husband Tom, their son Nick and another neighbor, Steve Carcerano, entered the home late in the evening after Drew told her he could not get in touch with his ex-wife.She recalled: 'I went into the 
bathroom, seen Kathleen in the tub and I ran out of the bathroom and 
threw myself on the floor and started screaming. '

Peterson checked Savio's pulse and when she asked if she was dead he replied: 'Yes Mary, she is.'

She said she noticed dried blood in 
Savio's hair and blood coming from her mouth, and she had bruises on her
wrists and buttocks.

Mrs Pontarelli said she offered to 
cover Savio with a towel 'because I didn't want people to see her like 
that. But he (Peterson) said we weren't supposed to touch anything and 
we couldn't do that.'

The prosecution is expected to try 
and use statements that Stacy Peterson made to her minister before she 
vanished in which she said that her husband had admitted to killing 
Savio. 

While hearsay is usually barred, if 
the judge admits Stacy Peterson’s statements, the testimony could be 
damaging to Peterson, according to Kathleen Zellner, a Chicago attorney 
who has been following the case.

‘What
the judge is going to do is he's going to wait and make individual 
rulings each time the prosecution tries to introduce hearsay, not give a
blanket ruling, but listen to see if they open the door in some way 
that makes the hearsay admissible. He'll make this a day by day ruling 
on these different pieces,’ Zellner told ABC News.

‘Essentially
we've got Peterson confessing the murder of Savio to his fourth wife, 
but we still have the question of whether that will come in.’ 

Prosecutors
will also try to admit Stacy Peterson's statements to her minister that
she saw Drew Peterson arrive home with women's clothing around the time
of Savio's death.

Savio's
sister may take the stand to describe Savio's statements that Peterson 
threatened her with a knife and said he could make her death look like 
an accident.

‘That
doesn't concern us,’ Peterson's attorney, Joel Brodsky told ABC News 
this week. ‘Anybody that knows anybody that has been through a divorce 
knows that people say things and do things that is totally out of 
character, and clearly Kathy was trying to build a case to try and get 
as much money as she could.’ 

The
outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the 
seven men and five women on the jury will believe: Bryan Mitchell or 
Larry Blum.

Mitchell, 
who investigated Savio’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head
and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall, died 
earlier this year. The defense will likely call expert witnesses to 
testify that the woman’s death was accidental.

Blum, who investigated Savio's body 
after it was exhumed in 2007, will testify for the prosecution at the 
trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental 
fall to homicidal drowning.

‘First, they are not going to be able
to say that (the death investigation was botched) because it wasn't,’ 
Peterson's attorney said. ‘By saying that if they had done a better job 
in the investigation, then they would have been able to prosecute Drew 
Peterson, that lowers the burden of proof. Where you don't have 
evidence, you presume innocence.’
