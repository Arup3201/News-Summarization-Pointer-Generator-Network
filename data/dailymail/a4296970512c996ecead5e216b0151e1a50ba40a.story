BBC radio presenter who said women should 'keep their knickers on' during radio discussion about Ched Evans is to be investigated by broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.

Nick Conrad was leading a live debate on BBC Radio Norfolk about Evans, a former Sheffield United striker, who was released from prison in October after serving half of a five year prison sentence for raping a teenage girl.

There had been speculation Evans would return to play for the team, leading to criticism from sexual abuse charities as well as the resignation of a number of the club's patrons including Charlie Webster. Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would ask for her name to be removed from a stand at Sheffield United's ground if the player was reinstated.

During the discussion about Evans on the BBC show Mr Conrad suggested women should be more aware of a man's sexual desire and how 'difficult' it is for them to stop.

He said: 'I think women need to be more aware of a man's sexual desire that when you're in that position that you are about to engage in sexual activity there's a huge amount of energy in the male body, there's a huge amount of will and intent, and it's very difficult for many men to say no when they are whipped up into a bit of a storm.'

The 29-year-old presenter was labelled ignorant by rape charities after his comments. 

He also said: 'What I'm trying to say is that women also have to understand that when a man's given certain signals he'll wish to act upon them and if you don't wish to give out the wrong signals, it's best, probably, to keep your knickers on and not get into bed with him. Does that make sense?'

At the time Katie Russell, a spokeswoman for the Rape Crisis England and Wales charity, said the debate around Evans had highlighted broader issues about the way we discuss men and women and sexual abuse. 

She said: 'The idea that men's sexual desires render them incapable of taking responsibility for their actions or respecting another person's right to choose what happens to their body is unfounded, outdated and offensive to men.' 

Norfolk Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner Jenny McKibben also criticised Mr Conrad's comments, and a number of people posted tweets showing their distaste for his comments. Listeners also complained to the broadcaster and the BBC and Mr Conrad both apologised. 

The father-of-one found himself compared to fictional character Alan Partridge, who is known for making politically incorrect comments, after the show.

He further attracted criticism when he said during the live debate he said: 'It's the old adage about if you yank a dog's tail don't be surprised when it bites you.'

Ofcom is now investigating after a number of complaints were received following Mr Conrad's comments. 

A spokesman for the watchdog said: 'Ofcom is currently investigating whether the use of derogatory language against women in this live debate about convicted rapist Ched Evans met generally accepted standards.'

Ched Evans was released from prison in October after serving half of his sentence for the rape of a teenage girl at a hotel in Rhyl in 2011.

An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012, but his case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

Since he has been released the 25-year-old has repeatedly protested his innocence and insisted that sex with the woman had been consensual. The former footballer also posted a statement on his website saying he will continue to fight to clear his name.

On November 11 - less than a month after Evans was released from prison - Sheffield United issued a statement confirming he would be allowed to train with them again. 

This statement provoked widespread criticism and speculation that he could be given another contract. The furore led to the club losing a number of its patrons and seeing many sponsors threaten to leave in the nine days that followed.

After the announcement television presenter Charlie Webster stood down as patron. She was followed by singer Dave Berry and businesswoman Lindsay Graham. 

The next day heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill confirmed she would ask for her name to be removed from the stand at Bramall Lane if Evans was offered a contract. The stand was named after her in recognition of her success at the London 2012 Olympics. Mrs Ennis-Hill was then subjected to abuse from Twitter trolls threatening her with rape. 

Two days later former Beautiful South frontman Paul Heaton also resigned as a patron of United's Community Foundation over the Evans affair.

On November 20 Sheffield United confirmed it had revoked the offer for Evans to train with them and would not be offering him a contract. Evans was then understood to be in talks with Oldham, a league one team. But the club confirmed today they would also not be signing him. 

FA chairman Greg Dyke was also drawn into the row after he said discussion over whether Evans,  should play football again was ‘not an important issue’. The Professional Footballers' Association of Ireland's (PFAI) solicitor Stuart Gilhooly  also attracted criticism after he said Evans deserved a second chance.
