You might have hoped Britain’s scandal-hit banks would be offering a more sympathetic ear to unhappy customers.

But a damning report published today by the Financial Ombudsman Services show customers are being ‘industrially processed’ like ‘numbers’, and seeing a growing number of legitimate complaints rejected by their bank.

The Ombudsman handles complaints when they have been rejected by a bank or other financial company.

Ombudsman's latest figures show most of the big banks are taking an increasingly hard line on complaints, with HSBC replacing Barclays as the worst offender

Its latest figures show most of the big banks are taking an increasingly hard line on complaints, with HSBC replacing Barclays as the worst offender.

The Ombudsman said it received 12,429 complaints about the High Street giant and upheld 78 per cent in favour of the customer. This compares with an uphold rate of 46 per cent in the second half of last year.

The same pattern can be seen at Lloyds, with the Ombudsman upholding 66 per cent of 30,768 complaints about the state backed lender in the first half.

This compares with 54 per cent in the second half of last year.

The ‘uphold rate’ with Royal Bank of Scotland complaints also increased from 33 per cent to 38 per cent.

Barclays was the only big bank to show an improvement although it still has one of the worst records.

The Ombudsman upheld 66 per cent of complaints about the banking giant, although this was a fall from 77 per cent.

Chief ombudsman Caroline Wayman said: ‘We’re seeing more and more people turn to us in frustration where they deal their bank of insurer simply doesn’t understand or really care. And we’re hearing growing dis-satisfaction from people about being processed industrially as a number rather than being listened to as an individual customer.’

Last night one MP accused banks of ‘cynically offloading’ complaints on the Ombudsman to save money.

The ‘uphold rate’ with Royal Bank of Scotland complaints also increased from 33 per cent to 38 per cent

Mark Garnier, a Conservative member of the influential Treasury Select Committee said: ‘These figures suggest banks are still cynically offloading responsibility for handling complaints to the Financial Ombudsman because it’s cheaper than doing it themselves.’

The Ombudsman received 191,129 new cases about financial firms in the first six months of the year – down from 248,801 in the second half of last year.

This was mainly due to a fall in disputes about Payment Protection Insurance, which still account for seven in ten disputes the Ombudsman deals with.

But banking complaints – which include grievances about credit cards, overdrafts and customer service - jumped 7 per cent from 23,088 to 24,724.

The proportion of complaints upheld by the Ombudsman is often seen as a more reliable gauge of how banks treat their customers today.

Overall the Ombudsman upheld 57 per cent of complaints about banks and other financial companies in the first half of the year, up from 51 per cent..

The figures from the Ombudsman come just days after City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority revealed it had ordered banks to re-open 2.5 million old PPI complaints that it believes may have been rejected unfairly.

Banks are also being forced to contact another two million ‘high risk’ customers that it believes may have been mis-sold PPI.

An HSBC spokesman said: ‘We work hard to ensure all of our customers receive a high level of service, but we know we don’t always get things right. Over past twelve months we have made a number of changes in response to the issues our customers have raised in their comments and complaints.’
