A petition to expediate the toughening of bail laws has received 79,000 signatures in the hours after the Sydney siege, in which the gunman was free despite facing sex assault and murder-related charges.  

Sarah Langston woke up on Tuesday morning to the horror of the siege at the Lindt cafe in Sydney, which resulted in the death of two innocent victims, and news that the gunman had been allowed to walk the streets despite his sketchy past.

A survivor of both a random vicious attack and domestic violence, the 31-year-old started a petition once learning Man Haron Monis received bail after being charged with accessory to his ex-wife's murder.

This decision was made despite Monis having 40 outstanding sexual assault charges and prior convictions - for writing malicious letters to the families of Australian soldiers who died in Afghanistan.

Sarah Langston, a survivor of both a random vicious attack and domestic violence, has started a petition calling for bail laws to be toughened

Ms Langston, a pre-school teacher, put the petition together with her friend, early childhood academic Dr Miriam Giugni, to call for stronger bail laws.

'Bail laws were meant to have been changed already, but 'administrative bungles' have stalled them until late January. That’s not good enough,' the petition says.

'We need stronger bail laws that would have kept this dangerous man behind bars right now.

'The public deserves to be protected from violent criminals.'

NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard said the government will conduct an investigation into the judicial system and why Monis was released from custody.

While NSW Premier Mike Baird said the bail laws could be tightened during the investigation of the new new risk-based system which came into force in May when Greg Smith was the state's Attorney General.

The controversial laws include removing the presumption of no bail for offenders with string of of serious offences.

On December 12 last year,Monis and his partner, Amirah Droudis were released on bail following the charges involving his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal's murder. 

Amendments to the new bail laws were expected to be introduced at the end of January but Ms Langston questions the proposed changes.

'Is what is going to come in January going to be enough and will it stay in place?' she said.

The siege saga felt too close to home for Ms Langston, who was randomly and viciously attacked just 200 metres from her front door in Sydney's inner west in 2012.

'He attacked me from behind - I was thrown to the ground and strangled and smothered - it was terrifying and very traumatic,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

'But I also feel lucky to have got away and grateful to be alive.'

Ms Langston believes that repeated violence offenders were let off too lightly in NSW.

'I was quite horrified when I woke up to discover he had 40 outstanding sexual assault charges but his bail had been continued,' she said.

'The system is failing - there needs to be changes to the decision-making process.' 

Ms Langston was pleasantly surprised at how quickly people jumped on board the campaign.

'I didn't expect this many signatures in a day,' she said. 

'I think it tapped into a vein for people who feel really disturbed by what has happened after being let down by the justice system.' 

'It shows that people genuinely care which is a great thing to take away from all of this.'  

Ms Langston says the new bail laws is a serious failure in the justice sytsem
