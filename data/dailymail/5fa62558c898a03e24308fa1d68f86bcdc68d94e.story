A host of unique Paddington Bear statues, designed by the likes of David Beckham, Emma Watson, Benedict Cumberbatch and Boris Johnson were unveiled in the capital on Monday.

The 3ft 6ins models are among 50 which will go on display around London as part of The Paddington Trail. 

It is hoped tourists and locals will spend the next two months travelling around the capital finding as many of the bears as possible.

The Paddington Trail is officially launched today  and will run until the end of the year.

Visitors will be able to follow in the footsteps of the famous Peruvian bear, by travelling around London.

Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, also got in on the design action, creating this 'Bear of London' creation

They are being placed near museums, parks, shops and key landmarks while Selfridges will be selling miniature Paddington Trail bears.

On December 10, the statues will be auctioned off online by Christie's and it is hoped millions will be raised for the NSPCC from their sale.

Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC, said: 'It's so exciting to see the capital being taken over by this famous duffle coat wearing bear, and I hope that Londoners and visitors to the capital alike will enjoy exploring The Paddington Trail over the coming weeks.

'In the Paddington stories, Aunt Lucy implored Londoners to 'please look after this bear' and we'll be giving people the chance to do just that when the statues are auctioned off later in the year in support of our ChildLine service.'

Boris Johnson added: 'London has a fine tradition of welcoming visitors from overseas and Paddington Bear is no exception.

'I hope Londoners and visitors to our great capital will follow the trail and perhaps offer him a Marmalade sandwich or two wherever they find him.'

There are also bears designed by Rolls-Royce, Ant McPartlin & Declan Donnelly, Jonathan Ross, Bear Grylls, and both Chelsea football team and the England rugby union team.

The Paddington Trail follows last year's Gromit Unleashed campaign in Bristol, where the 80 unique models ended up selling for more than £2.3 million.
