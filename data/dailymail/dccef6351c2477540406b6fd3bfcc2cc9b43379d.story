Authorities have said that up to 24 people are stuck on a roller coaster at Six Flags America in Maryland - and officials have said that they expect it to take hours to get them down.

Fire crews in Prince George County began working on Sunday afternoon to remove the frozen-in-place thrill-seekers strapped upright into the Joker's Jinx ride, 75-feet above the ground.

No injuries have been reported as a result of the malfunction on the roller coaster, which speeds up to 60 miles an hour and involves going upside down four times.

Stuck: Emergency workers seek to reassure the 24 passengers seated upright on the Joker's Jinx roller coaster at Six Flags America in Maryland

Technicians don't know what has caused the ride to become stuck on a curved part of the track and riders have been reached by park staff in cherry pickers and handed umbrella's to shade them from the sun.

'While we are not yet sure what caused the stoppage, the ride performed as it is designed to,' a statement provided to ABC News from Six Flags said.

'The ride will remain closed until the park completes a thorough investigation and both the staff and ride manufacturer have determined the ride is safe for operation,' the statement said.

The ride ceased operating at around 2.30pm and officers from Prince George County were on scene quickly and reached the passengers at around 4pm said Chief Marc Bashoor.

Care: The 24 passengers were handed umbrellas and water while they waited to be pulled from the top

In total there are 50 first responders on the scene and according to The Washington Post they have been delivering food and water to the riders.

Rescue options should the ride fail to be re-started apparently included ropes and harnesses for the passengers to lower themselves down from.

Because of the curvature of the track at the point where it has broken down, it is impossible to walk passengers off the roller coaster.

The Joker's Jinx ride will not being open until an investigation is completed.
