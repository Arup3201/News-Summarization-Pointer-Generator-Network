Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler says Luis Suarez's time at the club could be up after dragging their name through the mud yet again.

Suarez has created another storm in world football by appearing to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini in Uruguay's tempestuous 1-0 Group D win over Italy to reach the World Cup last 16.

Suarez now potentially faces an international ban for up to two years as FIFA open disciplinary proceedings against the striker.

With both Real Madrid and Barcelona linked with a summer move for Suarez, Fellow Kop idol Fowler would not be surprised if Liverpool cut their losses.

'Most Liverpool fans love him as a player but he’s continually dragged the club’s name through the mud,' Fowler told talkSPORT's Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show.

'It’s not right, especially after how they helped him last time. They tried to rehabilitate him. I wouldn’t be surprised if Suarez left now.

'He’s a different person on the pitch. I’m flummoxed, he’s dragged the good name of Liverpool through the mud again, and it’s not right.

'You can’t defend him. I love him as a player but you cannot condone what he’s done.'

The incident brought to mind Suarez's bite on Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in 2013 which forced a ten-game ban, while the Anfield club also defended their man in the aftermath of him racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra.

This is the third time Suarez faces disciplinary action for biting after the Ivanovic incident and earning a seven-match ban for biting PSV's Otman Bakkal while captain of Ajax.

Suarez's national team-mate Diego Godin was the hero, with the Atletico Madrid defender heading home just after the 'bite' to send Italy out of the competition.
