Recep Tayyip Erdogan is taking on supporters of the cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally

Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed international criticism of raids on media organizations in the country, telling the EU 'keep your opinions to yourselves.'

The 28-member bloc has criticized yesterday's police raids, which targeted a newspaper and a television station affiliated with the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen - a one-time ally of President Erdogan who has turned into one of his biggest critics. 

More than two dozen people, including a chief editor, journalists, television producers and scriptwriters, were detained in Sunday's raids, that included the Istanbul headquarters of Zaman newspaper and Samanyolu TV. 

They were targeted on suspicion of 'using intimidation and threats' to try to take control of the state.

The EU said Sunday's raids were incompatible with media freedoms and suggested they could affect Turkey's longstanding  bid to become part of the union.

But In a speech in northwest Turkey today, Erdogan called the arrests a domestic security issue and said he didn't care if the raids affect the country's EU membership bid.

'The issue is not one of media freedoms,' Erdogan said. 

'Those who threaten our national security - and it doesn't matter if they are members of the press - will get the response they deserve.

'Whether the EU takes us in or not, we have no such worry. You keep your opinions to yourselves,' 

Some of the suspects were released after questioning today.

Erdogan has accused Gulen's followers within the police and judiciary of being behind corruption allegations that rattled his government last year and has vowed to go after them.

Pro-Erdogan newspapers said those detained were being questioned over allegations they were involved in 2009 in making false accusations and fabricating evidence that a rival Islamic group had links to al-Qaida

The episode led to a police crackdown on the rival group, but the Gulen movement rejects the allegation.

Erdogan has been in open conflict with Gulen since a graft investigation targeting Mr Erdogan's inner circle emerged a year ago.

'The free press cannot be silenced,' a crowd chanted outside Zaman's offices as its editor Ekrem Dumanli made a speech defiantly challenging police to detain him - as Hidayet Karaca, the chairman of Samanyolu TV, was arrested in Istanbul.

Just before his arrest, Mr Karaca told reporters: 'This is a shameful sight for Turkey.

'Sadly in 21st century Turkey, this is the treatment they dish out to a media group with tens of television and radio stations, internet media and magazines.'

Arrest warrants had reportedly been issued for 32 people.

State broadcaster TRT Haber said 23 people were detained in raids across the country, including two former police chiefs. 

As well as Mr Karaca, a television producer, a director and scriptwriters were held.

Mr Erdogan introduced many democratic reforms in his first years in power and curbed army involvement in politics after his AK Party was elected in 2002.

NATO allies often cited Turkey, a candidate for the EU, as an example of a successful Muslim democracy.

But more recently critics have accused the President of intolerance of dissent and, increasingly, a divisive reversion to Islamist roots.

English-language Today's Zaman editor Bulent Kenes told Reuters police had shown them documentation which referred to a charge of 'forming a gang to try and seize state sovereignty'.

Government ministers declined to make specific comments on the raids, but Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu, according to state media, said: 'Anyone who does wrong pays the price'.

Main opposition CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said: 'This is a coup government. A coup is being carried out against democracy'.

Mr Erdogan has accused Mr Gulen of establishing a 'parallel structure' within the state through his supporters in the judiciary, police and other state institutions, as well as wielding influence through the media. 

The cleric denies the accusation of seeking to overthrow Mr Erdogan's government. 

Mr Erdogan drew on Mr Gulen's influence on the police and judiciary in the first years of his government in taming an army that had toppled four administrations since 1960, including Turkey's first Islamist-led cabinet.

That relationship has dramatically soured.

Mr Erdogan, who consolidated his power further in moving from the prime minister's office to the presidency in August, said on Friday he would pursue Mr Gulen's supporters into their 'lairs'. 

He has described them in the past as terrorists and traitors.

The graft investigation, which became public with police raids on December 17 last year, led to the resignation of three ministers and prompted Mr Erdogan to purge the state apparatus.

He reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of judges and prosecutors and has also pushed through legislation increasing government control of the judiciary - most recently a law restructuring two top courts. 

Meanwhile, prosecutors have dropped the corruption cases.

Today's police raids had been expected for several days after a widely-followed Twitter account, which has previously given advance warning of police operations, said police were set to detain around 400 people, including around 150 journalists regarded as Mr Gulen supporters.
