On a hotel terrace in Rio de Janeiro, Fabio Capello was asked for his opinion on the state of Italy’s team.

Then the England manager, the Italian shook his head before expressing what a pity it was that their brightest young player was such a troublesome individual. Capello appeared to see it as something of a national tragedy, and something that would undermine Italy’s chances of success there in Brazil three years later.

Mario Balotelli was 21 at the time, and younger still when Jose Mourinho all but wrote him off too. The precociously gifted striker, Mourinho had concluded in their time together at Inter Milan, was ‘unmanageable’.

Quite how Balotelli responds to such damning verdicts I couldn’t say. He’s not a player I’ve had the opportunity to interview.

But I suspect even the most cocksure young man, one trying to make his way in a tough profession, would be sensitive to the opinions of two of the finest football managers in Europe. I’d consider it more likely such words would cut deep, given that rejection has been such a central theme in Balotelli’s life.

As we know, his childhood was spent mostly in foster care. And even if those foster parents were as wonderful as he says, so wonderful he eventually adopted their surname, those formative years must have been tough when the authorities had to place him in care when he was three-years-old.

To begin with he would spend weekends with his biological parents and siblings, but eventually that stopped too.

It was not until his 18th birthday that Balotelli was able to apply for Italian citizenship. But he did so because he felt more Balotelli than Barwuah, his biological Ghanaian family name.

*Balotelli's two goals for the Reds so far this season have come against Ludogorets in the Champions League and Swansea in the Capital One Cup

He had rejected a senior international call-up from Ghana when he was just 16, opting instead to play for Italy and eventually making his debut two days before his 20th birthday.

If he adopted Italy not everyone in Italy was quite so keen to adopt him. As an 18-year-old playing for Inter he was racially abused by Juventus supporters, and suffered further abuse from supporters of other clubs the following season.

None of this necessarily excuses his behaviour these past few years but it might go some way to explaining why he can pose problems even for skilled man-managers of the pedigree of Mourinho. Balotelli’s behaviour has exposed not only a lack of maturity but a lack of judgement. He can be surly, selfish, unruly, and a huge frustration to his coaches given how brilliant he so often is in training.

But does that mean he should be dismissed as a lost cause? Does that mean every manager out there should consider him more trouble than he’s worth? Or do you attempt to harness that considerable potential, attempt to show him some understanding and hope that, in time, a player who is still only 24 can mature into a proper professional?

It is abundantly clear Balotelli was not at the top of the shopping list Brendan Rodgers scribbled down after losing Luis Suarez to Barcelona. Liverpool’s manager admitted it was ‘a calculated risk’, even if £16million might amount to a fairly expensive risk.

But a swapped shirt, a flicked ear and some indifferent appearances aside, just how big a headache has he so far proved for his latest employers?

I’m told he hasn’t been fined and he hasn’t once been late for training, even if Rodgers has taken steps to make sure he is always punctual by having a driver take him to and from his new home in Formby on Merseyside.

He has not been a nuisance in training. On the contrary, he appears to be popular among his team-mates and committed to working hard. This week Daniel Sturridge said as much.

If Rodgers says he wants to change Balotelli, it is more in the way he plays than in the way he conducts himself.

He wants to see more movement and he wants to see him occupy a role that will create an effective partnership with Sturridge once the England striker has returned from injury. In a newspaper column Michael Owen suggests Rodgers is trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, but let’s see.

Rodgers will work with Balotelli and at the same time he wants Balotelli to work with Dr Steve Peters, in the hope that the prominent sports psychiatrist can help him develop into the player Liverpool’s manager sincerely hopes he can become.

Peters is not a miracle worker, and earlier this year far too much emphasis was put on the role that he plays. To the point, in fact, where it all became nonsensical and rather unfair.

When Liverpool lost out on the title, it was somehow Peters’ fault. When Ronnie O’Sullivan lost the world snooker final, again it was Peters’ fault. Indeed when England followed a spirited display against Italy (albeit one devalued by a Balotelli goal) with two utterly woeful performances, it was Peters’ fault. Never mind that Peters had only a few weeks with the players. Any apparent mental weakness was down to him.

All Peters can ever do is give an athlete the tools he believes can help them achieve their goals. After that it still very much remains up to the athlete.

But ask Jonathan Trott how important a role Peters has played in enabling him to overcome a stress-related illness and return to top class cricket. This week he was invited to tour with the England Lions this winter.

Ask O’Sullivan how Peters guided him back from the brink of premature retirement and helped him to win more world titles. Ask Sir Bradley Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton the extent to which Peters helped them achieve their success. Asked Sir Dave Brailsford why Peters is such a valued member of his staff.

Suarez did not work with Peters as much as Rodgers would have liked, and it might help explain why a season when he appeared to be making such progress concluded with him biting another opponent at the World Cup.

But I only have to listen to Trott to believe that if anyone can help Balotelli conquer whatever demons might still be troubling him, it is Peters.

It might not work, and what Rodgers is trying to do might not work either. But let’s at least give them a bit of time.
