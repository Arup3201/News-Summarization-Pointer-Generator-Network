A drink driver caught by police was eight times over the limit, a senior officer has said.

The 36-year-old woman was stopped by Cleveland Police in September in Redcar and tests showed she had 275mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35.

The reading was a massive 126mg higher than that of the next culprit, a 33-year-old man who was stopped at 12.15am in Hartlepool in March and tested at 149mg.

Staggering: A woman in Redcar, North Yorkshire, was an incredible eight times over the drink drive limit

Others in the highest readings included a man with a reading of 142mg and three women who tested at 141mg, 136mg and 130mg, all stopped in the town of Stockton, County Durham.

Details of the incident were revealed by
a Freedom of Information request and published by the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette newspaper.

Ed Turner, temporary Chief Inspector of Cleveland and Durham Specialist Operations Unit, said: 'I am shocked and astounded by the high level of that reading.

The incredible case was unveiled by a Freedom of Information request to Cleveland Police

'However that is quite a unique and isolated example.

'I am delighted we managed to capture and prosecute that person.'

The reading was taken at 7.25pm. The circumstances of why the woman was stopped were not clear.

Mr Turner said most people recognise the dangers of drink driving on a night out, but many did not think about the next morning.

Mr Turner said: 'You really need to be careful and allow the time for the drink to get out of your system before driving.'
