You could be forgiven for thinking Aston Villa had forgotten where the goal is this season.

The Villains haven’t found the net in the Premier League in five games and have the lowest goals scored total in the league – a measly 11.

That’s an average of 0.5 goals a game so far this season, eight short of Sunderland who are next on the list of goal-shy squads in the division.

But, Villa strikers Gabriel Agbonlahor, Christian Benteke and Andreas Weimann, plus former striker Darren Bent, took to FIFA to prove to fans they still understand the aim of a striker’s game.

Agbonlahor has only scored three league goals this season, but he and former team mate Bent showed they both still have an eye for goal as they beat Benteke and Weimann 5-4 in a thriller.

Benteke and Weimann made it interesting in the second of the best of three as they secured a win to ensure the match would go to a decider, thanks largely to a couple of Agbonlahor obtained red cards.

But, Agbonlahor and Bent secured the win with a routine 3-0 victory over their fellow strike duo, who were forced to do press-ups as a forfeit for losing. 

Aston Villa fans will now be hoping the trio will work out how to replicate the action on the pitch against Bournemouth on Sunday - a side that has scored more goals in Birmingham this season than they have...
