'A bubbly, caring person': Lisa Orsi, who died in Singapore this morning after suffering extreme altitude sickness on a volcano trek in Indonesia

A young British physiotherapist has died after suffering extreme altitude sickness during a volcano trek in Indonesia.

Lisa Orsi, 22, from Derry city in Northern Ireland, was pronounced dead in Singapore this morning, two weeks after trekking on a popular route up a volcano on East Java.

Her parents Dennis and Sharon were by her bedside as she slipped away in the early hours following extensive transplant surgery at Singapore General Hospital. 

Nine of Miss Orsi's organs will go to patients in need of transplants.

Her parents said: 'Lisa was a bubbly, caring person whose infectious joy for life endeared her to so many people. We take comfort in their prayers and well-wishes at this time.

'Even in this dark hour we can look to take solace from knowing that even in her death Lisa's generosity has brought new life to others and given them a second chance.'

Irish-born Miss Orsi, who moved to Derry from Donegal aged five, was described as a fit, healthy young woman, who enjoyed athletics and Gaelic football. 

She collapsed in the shower and fell into a coma after trekking a popular tourist route up an East Java volcano last month.

Medics in Indonesia and Singapore spent the past fortnight trying to save her life before turning their attention to using her organs for donation.

The law in Singapore makes it compulsory for people who die suddenly to have their organs donated unless they are Muslim or have expressly wished otherwise. 

Recently qualified as a physio, Miss Orsi was half way through a two year contract at Bright Vision Hospital in Hougang. 

She had been playing Gaelic football with the Singapore Gaelic Lions in her first year in the city.

In a statement to the Press Association, Ms Orsi's parents added: 'The medical team at Siloam Hospital, Surabaya, who initially treated Lisa and the staff at Singapore General Hospital have provided excellent medical care. They have treated Lisa with great compassion and we will be forever appreciative of their efforts.'

'We brought Lisa back to Singapore as it is a place that is so very dear to her heart. She has always spoken of it as a second home and we have been so grateful to receive a homecoming welcome from her Singapore brothers and sisters.

'Lisa has been very fortunate to be surrounded by friends both from her working life and her club-mates from the Singapore Gaelic Lions. Gaelic Football has been a childhood passion for Lisa and we are overwhelmed by all that her GAA family have done for her.'

The Orsi family are now making arrangements for their daughter's repatriation and funeral in her home city, possibly next week.

They said it would be impossible to personally thank everybody who had helped them over the past two weeks.

'However, as a family, we would like to thank her best friends, Eve King and Sinead McElhinney, the clubs, schools and so many others at home in Ireland for their spontaneous outpouring of love and support. This includes her childhood school, Saint Patrick's and St Brigid's College, and Salford University alumni,' the parents said.

The grieving couple paid special tribute to Ms Orsi's boss Limin Yong, who they said gave them so much guidance and assistance.

They also thanked Irish politicians Pat Ramsey MLA and Pat 'The Cope' Gallagher MEP and Irish consular staff in both Indonesia and Singapore.

'Their help has been invaluable and we thank them for their ongoing efforts to assist Lisa and the Orsi family,' the couple said.

The family also spoke highly about the work of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Asia and at home for helping to fund raise and offering any other support to them over the last two weeks.
