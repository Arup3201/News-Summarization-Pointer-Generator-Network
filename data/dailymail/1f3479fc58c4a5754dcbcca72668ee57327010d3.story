The cute factor went through the roof at Washington, DC's National Zoo on Monday as media got their first adorable shots of giant panda cub Bao Bao.

America fell in love with The 4-month-old cub when she became just the second surviving cub born at the zoo back in August.

Already the spritely bear is climbing rocks and teething on bamboo in her enclosure and Monday's sneak press peak only heightens excitement for her January 18 public debut.

Adorable: Bao Bao, the Giant Panda cub was glimpsed by the media for the first time Monday at the National Zoo in Washington, DC

Too cute: Bao Bao won't be on public display until January 18, but media were invited for a brief glimpse on Monday

'Now is when she's starting to walk a lot more,' National Zoo senior curator Brandie Smith told myfoxdc. 'She's just like a little toy.'

Mei Xiang's only other surviving cub, a male named Tai Shan, was born in 2005.

Male panda Tian Tian is the father of both cubs.

Unfortunately for Tai Shan, her big brother was returned to China in 2010 for breeding.

But the frisky cub isn't letting it get her down.

Bao Bao has been a hit since her birth and will soon make her debut in a public viewing enclosure

Bouncing baby: Bao Bao weighed nearly 17 pounds at only four months old thanks to a steady diet of rich mother panda milk

Historic: Bao Bao is only the second baby panda born at the National Zoo to survive

Thriving: The cub made headlines when she was born in August and the world has been able to watch her thrive on the zoo's live panda cam

The National Zoo's panda cam, on which viewers can watch Bao Bao play and climb and grow, has become a huge success.

Bao Bao's media debut came just as the U.S. was bracing for some of the coldest temperatures on record.

While the cub will certainly be kept out of the historic chill, what happens to her mother and the other adult animals?

'Every animal has a protocol for cold weather,' Smith explained. 'Some animals won't go outside at all tomorrow. Other animals will go in and out.'

Giant pandas are considered critically endangered in the wild, and breeding them in captivity has proved difficult, especially in Washington. Zoo scientists have made numerous attempts to artificially inseminate its female panda because the pair failed to breed naturally.

The new birth has given zoo scientists renewed confidence in the Washington pandas' ability to help grow the panda species.

Last year, Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub, but it died after six days because its lungs hadn't fully developed and weren't sending enough oxygen to its liver. The zoo's first panda couple, Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing, had five cubs during the 1980s, though none lived more than a few days.
