A hundred homes were evacuated in suburban Philadelphia on Sunday because of a foul stench that turned out to be a 'volatile organic compound' coming from water in the basements.

For hours, authorities had scrambled to figure out where the odor was coming from as around 150 people were moved from their homes in the Skippack Township neighborhood.

They have now revealed that the smell was coming from a compound in the sump pumps in the basement. The pumps remove water that has accumulated in a water collecting sump basin.

Evacuation: Around 100 homes in Skippack Township were evacuated on Sunday night after an odor seeped through the area. Authorities now believe it was coming from sump pumps in the basements

The
 Montgomery County Department of Public Safety said the county hazardous
 response team, state Department of Environmental Protection and federal
 Environmental Protection Agency are working to identify the compound 
involved. It is not known if it is harmful.

Previous reports said that officials had found readings of hydrogen 
cyanide in about 100 homes, but WFMZ reported that officials believed the odor was actually coming from another chemical.

NBC reported that hydrogen cyanide can smell like 'bitter almond' or 'old sneakers'.

Reports of the noxious smell began shortly before 6pm on Sunday and an emergency 
shelter was set up at the local elementary school for families who did not have anywhere to stay for the night.

Homeowner Matt Logan made the first call to authorities at about 5.45pm, WFMZ reported.

'My
 wife called and said she had a chemical smell in the house and called 
me,' he told the channel. 'I came home and walked in the house. As soon as I walked in I could 
smell it. And then we called 911 and they came out and advised us to go 
get my wife and kids checked at the hospital.'

First call: Matt Logan took his wife and children to hospital to be checked out after they reported the smell

More than eight fire companies and 
Montgomery County hazardous-materials experts responded to the call 
in the Fairlawn Court townhouse development.

Some residents went 
to a hospital as a precaution but were released.

Spokespeople for Peco Energy Co. and Spectra Energy Corp. - the two energy companies that provide for the complex - said their systems were operating normally.

Residents now need to contact the 
township to have their homes tested for the presence of the compound 
before returning home, AP reported.
