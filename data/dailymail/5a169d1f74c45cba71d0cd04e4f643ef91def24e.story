A man charged with killing a 
University of New Hampshire student in October plotted with a girlfriend
to tell investigators she was strangled during a consensual sex act, 
prosecutors said.

Court documents released Tuesday 
charge 30-year-old Seth Mazzaglia of Dover with killing 19-year-old 
Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott during an attempted sexual assault on October
9.

The indictments allege an extensive 
cover-up by Mazzaglia and his then-girlfriend, Kathryn McDonough, 
including using Marriott's car to drive her body to Peirce Island in 
Portsmouth and dumping it in the Piscataqua River.

Her body has never 
been recovered.

Mazzaglia is also charged with second-degree murder for showing 'extreme indifference to human life.'

A hindering prosecution charge 
details a series of actions the couple allegedly took to mislead police.
Prosecutors say McDonough sent a text to Marriott an hour after she was
killed at their Dover apartment asking why she never showed up for 
their planned visit.

The indictments allege the pair also 
broke Marriott's cellphone and GPS tracking system and abandoned 
Marriott's car in a parking lot at the University of New Hampshire, 
where Marriott had transferred to as a sophomore to study marine 
biology.

Prosecutors say they also concocted 
the plan to say Marriott was killed accidentally during a consensual sex
act - a notion that the lead prosecutor and Marriott's family Tuesday 
decried as false.

'There's no allegation of anything 
consensual,' Senior Assistant Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin said 
Tuesday. 'On the contrary, it was not consensual.'

Marriott's parents, Bob and Melissa 
Marriott of Westborough, Massachusetts, called the suggestion their 
daughter was killed during some bizarre consensual sex act 
'reprehensible.'

Their lawyer, George Thompson, said 
the Marriotts are 'resolute in their demands for justice for Lizzi' and 
are satisfied with the indictments.

Mazzaglia faces two alternate theory 
first-degree murder charges. One alleges he strangled Marriott. The 
other alleges he used physical force to strangle her before, during or 
after an attempt to sexually assault her.

Marriott's disappearance on October 9 led
to a massive search, and her family and friends distributed leaflets 
throughout the seacoast region seeking clues to her whereabouts. Her 
cellphone was last used in Dover at 10:11 p.m. that night.

On October 13, four days after Marriott 
was last heard from, police took Mazzaglia into custody and charged him 
with second-degree murder.

An outdoor memorial service at UNH drew hundreds of somber students, some of whom spoke of exuberance and love of life.

University President Mark Huddleston 
told the sea of students that even though she had been at UNH only a 
short time, she was very much a part of the college community.

'Losing Lizzi was losing part of ourselves,' Huddleston said.

Mazzaglia, who is being held without 
bond, is due in court May 2.

Attorney Joachim Barth, one of the public 
defenders representing Mazzaglia, on Tuesday declined to comment on the 
indictments.

McDonough is due to return to court 
Thursday for a bail hearing, but may waive that hearing. She was 
indicted earlier this month on charges of hindering the prosecution, 
conspiracy and witness tampering.

According to The Portsmouth Herald, 
Mazzaglia had several accounts on online dating sites, including 
OKCupid.com, where his user name was listed as DarKaiser.

Another account of a 29-year-old 
DarKaiser was found on an S&M website described as 'the world's 
largest largest BDSM (bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, and
sadomasochism) community and the most exciting bondage and fetish Web 
site.'

The user by the name DarKaiser wrote in his profile that he is 'a master seeking a slave.'

On another bondage website described 
as a Facebook 'run by kinksters,' a 29-year-old DarKaiser from New 
Hampshire wrote that he was looking for 'a lifetime relationship, a 
relationship; a play partner' princess by day, slut by night' and a 
sub.'

In addition, Mazzaglia claims to have a 750 hour certification in massage therapy awarded by McIntosh College in 2007.

Marriott was a 2011 graduate of 
Westborough High School in Massachusetts. She lived with an aunt in 
Chester and commuted to the Durham campus.
