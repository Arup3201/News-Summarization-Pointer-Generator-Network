Britons woke up this morning to find their homes and cars covered in dust from the Sahara Desert.

Unusual atmospheric conditions have blown up a sandstorm from Africa - and a thin layer of dust was seen today in areas of southern England including Cornwall and Greater London.

The Met Office has forecast a ten out of ten level of air pollution for London for tomorrow and Wednesday, with warnings that the dust will this week cause one of the worst smogs of the year.

With such a high level of pollution 
expected tomorrow, people with lung problems and the elderly have been 
advised to avoid strenuous exercise - and healthy adults told to reduce 
exertion outdoors.

Steve Nash of Highworth, Wiltshire, was one of many drivers in the UK shocked when they found the residue on their vehicles today.

The
 43-year-old said: ‘I'm quite interested in weather and I follow it all 
the time, but I have never seen anything like this before. It happened 
this afternoon.

'Most 
of the cars in the street are also covered in the thin layer of sand. 
It's amazing when you think about how far it has come.’

From Africa to Britain: A sandstorm over Algeria last week saw sand launched high into the atmosphere

 said: ‘This does happen - it has happened before.

A 'coincidence of climatic and meteorological influences', according to experts, has led to Saharan sand being whirled high into the sky and whisked across Africa and mainland Europe before coming down.

A sandstorm over Algeria last week saw sand launched high into the atmosphere.

The Sahara is one of the largest deserts in the world - almost as big as China - and is often battered by strong winds.

With the wind currently arriving here from the South/South-East, the conditions were in place to carry that sand over Cornwall.

Then, light persistent rain yesterday brought it down to earth.

When that rain dried, it left the sand as a visible residue on cars across Cornwall, London, western Wales and Ireland. 

This sort of weather event happens several times a year, particularly in the summer, according to forecasters.

'But you need the 
combination of elements - the sandstorm in the Saharan region, the wind 
from the South/South-East, and the right sort of rain.

‘You need a light rain, not too much -
 just enough to bring it down and then when it dries out it leaves that 
residue on cars. It's probably because the rain is not that heavy that 
it does not get brought down and washed off straight away. Of course it 
isn't dangerous.

‘The most it's going to be is an inconvenience to people who have it on their clean cars.’

Paul Hutcheon from the Met Office told
 the London Evening Standard that this kind of weather event happens 
‘several times a year, particularly in summer when you get these big 
dust storms in the western Sahara and the southerly winds to bring that 
dust here’.

April will kick off tomorrow with temperatures more than five degrees
warmer than average. The hottest day of the year so far is predicted tomorrow or Wednesday.

Tomorrow could see a foggy start in central and southern
areas and dull and wet weather in Scotland. But the fog is soon expected to
clear bringing lots of sunshine and warm weather.

Laura Young, of the Met Office, said today: ‘We are
expecting a warm week with temperatures at least five degrees above average.

Forecast: Temperatures climbed to 20.9C (69.6F) in the South East yesterday and today is expected to be almost as hot. That is compared to Madrid, where it is set to be 14C (57F) and 18C (64F) in Ibiza

‘We had the hottest day of the year 
yesterday when it hit 20.9C in St James's Park in London and we could 
see even higher tomorrow or Wednesday. At the moment the weekend is 
looking like a mixture of sun and showers.’

'Because the rain is not that heavy, it does not get brought down and washed off straight away'

Emma Sharples, Met Office forecaster

Temperatures climbed to 20.9C (69.6F) in the South East yesterday and today is expected to be almost as hot. That is compared to Madrid, where it is set to be 14C (57F), and 18C (64F) in Ibiza.

The sun is set to last all week, but it is expected to cool down before Saturday. The previous highest temperature so far this year was 20.5C (68.9F) in Gravesend, Kent, on March 9.  

In late March last year, Britain was shivering in snow and temperatures fell to minus 10C (14F). There were drifts as high as 4ft in the North and 20,000 homes lost power.
