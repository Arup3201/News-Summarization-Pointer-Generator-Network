Former 'Partridge Family' child star Danny Bonaduce has revealed how he was 'famous and homeless' in Hollywood after the 1970s TV series ended.

Bonaduce, now 53 and living in Seattle, said he was broke and forced to live in his car behind a dumpster near the iconic Grauman's Chinese Theater on the Walk of Fame.

He revealed that he often left his car in the morning and walked through a set of gates onto Hollywood Boulevard, where he was an instantly-recognizable celebrity.

Homeless and famous: Danny Bonaduce revealed that he lived in his car behind a dumpster near the Hollywood Walk of Fame after his role on 'The Partridge Family' ended

'I'd wake up, kind of wipe my eyes, and I'd go right through the little arch and I'd be in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater, where everybody's footprints are,' he told Oprah's OWN TV.

'I was still famous and people had no idea I lived behind the dumpster.  I'd be taking pictures with people and signing autographs.'

Bonaduce had made the revelation before on his radio show, but he recounted the story in vivid detail for the talk diva's new show 'Where Are They Now?'

Bonaduce captured America's heart as the red-headed middle child Danny Partridge on 'The Partridge Family.'

But his wise-cracking character on the small screen belied an abusive and dysfunctional home life. When the show ended in 1974 when Bonduce was 16, he was left with little money and no home to return to for a time. 

'So, I was homeless in Hollywood, which, by the way, is as good a place as any,' he said.

Bonaduce says his childhood was fraught with dysfunction and abuse and he turned to drugs and alcohol before the shown even ended when he was 15

Bondauce greeted fans and signed autographs on Hollywood Boulevard, but when it came time for him to retire for the night he had to slink away when nobody was looking.

He didn't want anyone to knew that he slept in his car.

'It was totally embarrassing to be famous and homeless,' he admitted.

After decades of drugs and alcohol abuse and a slew of arrests - including in 1991 for allegedly beating a transvestite prostitute - Bonaduce found sobriety.

And he has forged a second career for himself as a radio host. He is currently the morning talk show host on Seattle's KZOK-FM, a classic rock station.

To honor his new home, he showed up a tattoo of the city's skyline that he he had inked across his entire back.

'When people ask me about this tattoo, my immediate response is "Oh I was drunk,'" he said.

'But then I realize I've never had a drink in the state of Washington, so I've just got to take responsibility for the fact that I do weird stuff sometimes.'
