It's the viral campaign that's taken social media by storm with world-wide support from celebrities and dignitaries alike.

Thanks to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, Motor Neurone Disease Australia has received more than $832,000 worth of donations when the campaign came down under on August 10.

And the figures continue to be mind-blowing as Daily Mail Australia can reveal the donations recorded from the past couple of weeks are 26 times more than funds from last year.

The viral challenge for ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), which is known as MND (motor neurone disease) in Australia, kicked off in the U.S. late July.

Dr Moira O'Connor says it's a long way until a cure for MND is found

Since it launched in Australia just over two weeks ago, a grand figure of $832,450.20 was donated to MNDA by 20,419 people.

'It's been absolutely mind-blowing,' a MNDA spokeswoman said, noting that it's been by far the biggest year of donations for the organisation.

With about 1,900 Australians affected by MND, researchers and families finally feel as though they've been given a voice through the highly successful awareness campaign for the progressive and terminal neurological disease.

Half of the donations will go towards MNDA's research arm, the MND Research Institute of Australia.

'MNDRIA allocates funds to the best research with the greatest chance of increasing our understanding of MND, and moving us closer to finding an effective treatment and cure for the disease,' Janet Nash, MNDA's Executive Officer Research, said.

While Perth senior researcher Dr Moira O'Connor says 'effective treatment and a cure is inevitably a long way off', more research is needed into providing support for MND patients and also families.

'MND gradually weakens the muscles as people lose their ability to talk, walk, swallow and eventually lose their ability to function,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Dr O'Connor, from Curtin University's School of Psychology and Speech Pathology, is focusing on the psychological effects to support the emotional well-being of both patients and carers.

'While patients feel flat and loss of hope carers also feel depressed because they have little control of the unpredictable symptoms and the physical burden of the job is quite demanding,' she said.

'There are good services available but always room for improvement to ensure a positive journey for all and to ensure people don’t fall through the cracks, maintaining positive attitude

Dr O'Connor said about five to 10 per cent of cases are inherited with the disease commonly affects males and those in the 50 to 60 age bracket.

'We hope the donations keep on coming, even when the viral campaigns fades out,' she said.

'We're still a long way from finding a cure so we hope MND isn't forgotten and people keep their ongoing commitment.'
