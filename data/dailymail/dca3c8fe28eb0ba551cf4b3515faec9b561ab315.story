A compound built for notorious cult leader, polygamist and child abuser Warren Jeffs has been turned into a bed and breakfast.

Fittingly for a property built for a man who once made the FBI’s list of 10 most wanted fugitives, the guesthouse in Hildale, Utah has been renamed Most Wanted Suites.

Construction of the ranch began in 2010 while Jeffs was awaiting trial in Texas for sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault of a child in the hope he would cleared of his crimes and could live there with his wives and children.

But the leader of Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was convicted in 2011 and sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years, with the ranch subsequently seized by the government.

After Jeff’s conviction, the newly-built compound was seized by the U.S. government and later put up for auction.

The winner of that auction was Willie Jessop – a former member of the church and a confidante of Jeffs, who later sued the group and won.

Jessop purchased the ranch with a bid of $3.6million during an auction in April 2013, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

Now he says he is using the guesthouse as a way of helping the local community to come to terms with the past.

‘The initial intent of the [the compound] was to be something exclusive, and the bed and breakfast concept made it something inclusive,’ he told the newspaper.

The cost of a stay at Most Wanted Suites is not listed on the company website, but each room comes with a private bathroom, and breakfast will either be served on site or at the Merry Wives Café down the road.

Jessops says the best room – a large circular space once intended as a bedroom for Jeffs himself – will be off limits for some time as it is currently being used to house a family whose property recently burned down.

The presence of the controversial church is never far from the ranch however, as both Hildale and neighbouring Colorado City in Arizona have high rates of membership.

Indeed the opening of the twin towns’ first bed and breakfast is part of a state-sponsored drive to boost a local economy hit by rising unemployment caused by rapidly dwindling membership of the church since Jeffs was jailed.

Most Wanted Suites has also already been used for a local function – albeit a reunion for former pupils of a high school run by Jeffs’ church.

Jeffs himself was born into the FLDS church, with his father Woodruff Steed the former leader. He was one of at least 60 children of Steed, who was survived by approximately 20 wives.

The Utah-based church believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven and arranged marriages  sometimes involve underage girls.

Upon Steed’s death Jeffs married all but two of his wives and instructed them to act as if his father was ‘still alive and in the next room.’

When Jeffs rose to lead the FLDS himself, he was given the title President and Prophet, Seer and Revelator’, and was also referred to a ‘President of the Priesthood.

As the sole individual allowed to conduct marriage ceremonies, Jeffs is believed to have been responsible for arranging hundreds of marriages between members.

Running the towns as a form of overlord, Jeffs even expelled 20 men – including the mayor – from Colorado City, before ‘reassigning’ their wives.

Much of the FLDS’ activity took place on the Yearning for Zion ranch, which is located just outside the town of Eldorado in Texas.

It was home to at least 500 members of the controversial church until as recently as April 2014, when the state of Texas seized it on suspicion the property was being used ‘to commit of facilitate certain criminal conduct’.

Jeffs himself was placed on the FBI’s most wanted list in May 2006 after he took flight while facing charges relating to arranging illegal marriages between adult male followers and underage girls.

He was arrested three months later in Nevada and hit with eight additional charges, including sexual conduct with minors and incest.

Following years of court cases – including a 10-year conviction for rape as an accomplice which was subsequently overturned – Jeffs was finally found guilty of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault of children and sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years.
