Facing the axe: Jon Reynard had been appointed to run the school after it was put in special measures

A talented headmaster parachuted in to save a failing school is facing the axe - because he is not a Roman Catholic.

The rule - laid down by Catholic bishops – means Jon Reynard cannot stay on after turning around the fortunes of Annecy Catholic Primary School in Seaford, East Sussex.

He had been appointed to run the school after Ofsted placed it in special measures last year.

One parent of a child at the school, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘It’s completely contradictory and unfair. The school is the only one in the catchment area not full to capacity.

'Children are allowed to attend if they are not Catholic. Mr Reynard has been fantastic for the school. Our children are happy under his leadership and are progressing well.’

The school had been rated ‘inadequate’ in all but two categories while under the leadership of former headmistress Fiona McGonigle, who left after a damning Ofsted report last October.

Mr Reynard was called in to mirror the success he had achieved as headmaster at nearby Seaford Primary School, and was made executive headteacher of both schools last year.

Reports by Ofsted said progress is being made at Annecy under his leadership, and it is anticipated that it will receive a good reception from inspectors due to visit in the coming weeks.

But he now faces the axe after school governors said a Catholic headteacher needs to be installed.

A spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton said: ‘To maintain the clear Catholic character of Catholic schools, the Bishops of England and Wales have stated that the posts of headteacher, deputy headteacher and head of religious education are to be filled by baptised and practising Catholics. The Diocese expects all Catholic schools in the diocese to follow this policy.’

Mr Reynard has insisted that he knew the conditions of the post from the start, adding that he had not been asked to leave the school yet, and would remain in his post for now.

He said: ‘I’ve come in to help the school improve, which it is, and hopefully get it up to a good standard at its next Ofsted inspection in September or October. We don’t know exactly when.’

But another parent said: ‘We would rather have an outstanding headteacher who is not Catholic, than a Catholic one who is rubbish. This is about our kids’ future at the end of the day, not religion.’
