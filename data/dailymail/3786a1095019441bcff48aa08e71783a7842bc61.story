Dubbed 'Kangaroo Dundee', Chris 'Brolga' Barnes has been saving orphaned kangaroo joeys in Outback Australia for the past nine years.

While working as a tour guide in the Northern Territory, he realised that people in remote areas of Australia were looking for a place to take orphaned or injured animals, so he opened The Baby Kangaroo Rescue Centre.

It was later redeveloped and expanded into the larger Kangaroo Sanctuary just outside of Alice Springs.

The little roo that inspired him to educate people and rescue other joeys was Palau, a joey that was left for dead on the side of the road.

'I was a tour guide at the time and I saw the roo on the road and I got off the bus to check it.  It was bloated and rotting, it'd been dead for a few days but there was still a joey barely alive in there,' Brolga told Daily Mail Australia.

'I called her Palau after the TV show Survivor, it was one of the tribes on there, I nursed her back to health and released her a year later.'

The baby kangaroos are kept together to bond and form a mob so they can be released together

It was from that first rescue that Brolga began devoting his life to saving baby kangaroos.

'That motivated me to set up an education centre, because so many people drive past carcases not knowing that there could be a little joey inside that's still alive,' he said.

He quickly discovered that The Baby Kangaroo Rescue Centre needed to be expanded, but he didn't have the funds, 'I had big dreams but no money!'

'I had a few kangaroos that had too many injuries to be released and the Northern Territory doesn't allow kangaroos as pets so they [the Northern Territory government]  were pushing me to find a place for them or to have them shot'.

Chris was working two jobs in order to fund the sanctuary in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, when a 'supportive uncle' left him an inheritance to build it.

From there Brolga's Kangaroo Sanctuary has gone from strength to strength.  His efforts were even documented for a BBC TV show called 'Kangaroo Dundee' a spin off of Paul Hogan's 'Crocodile Dundee'.

Kangaroo Dundee' was a two-part series about his story and life as a surrogate mother to so many baby joeys.

A finalist in the Australian of the Year awards this year, says he's always had a passion for animals and became a zookeeper at the age of 17.

'Anyone can do it,' he said, 'All it takes is learning how and being committed.'

His dedication goes above and beyond, as he often camps out with the roos in his sanctuary.

Brolga makes sure the joeys grow up among other kangaroos and are released back into the wild once they are healthy

Brolga started the Kangaroo Sanctuary from scratch working two jobs to support his passion for saving baby kangaroos

Brolga's 36 hectare area of bushland homes 30 kangaroos of various ages. He tries to keep the bushland untouched so that the roos all feel like they are in a natural habitat before being released.

For the young joeys he creates a faux pouch out of canvas bags and blankets or pillow cases.

'The babies need to be kept warm so they go everywhere I go' he said.

Since opening in 2005, Brolga's Kangaroo Sanctuary has saved over 200 kangaroos

It's a full-time job, these baby kangaroos need 24 hour care

Brolga, a true Aussie hero hopes to build Central Australia’s first wildlife hospital on the grounds of his Sanctuary.

'It would be good to have a place where my mates who also care for orphaned joeys could get medical assistance for the babies without having to go to a vet where out of pocket costs fall on them' said Mr Barnes.

'It's a long-term goal but one that I am slowly working towards and it would really benefit us here.'
