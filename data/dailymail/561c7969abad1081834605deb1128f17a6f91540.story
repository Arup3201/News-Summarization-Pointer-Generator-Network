Jermain Defoe is set to sign for Sunderland to spearhead Gus Poyet's attempts to guide the club away from the Premier League relegation zone.

Providing the deal is completed in time, the 32-year-old could make his debut against former club Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Saturday, where he will look to continue a remarkable trend of scoring on every debut he has had for each of his clubs.

He scored the winner and led West Ham to victory over Walsall on his debut in 2000, before marking the first appearance of a loan spell to Bournemouth with a goal in a 2-1 defeat to Stoke.

Defoe departed West Ham for a move to Tottenham in 2004 and scored after 13 minutes in his first game for the club, a 4-3 win over Portsmouth.

And Portsmouth became the next destination for Defoe in 2008 and the striker instantly endeared himself to the Fratton Park faithful by earning the south coast side a point in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea.

While the move to the Stadium of Light brings an end to an unhappy spell with Toronto FC for Defoe, life got off to a brilliant start with a double in his first game against Seattle Sounders.

Defoe joins Sunderland with the club 16th in the Premier League table, but they have only won three times this season, the lowest amount in the division.

Poyet's side are only a point clear of Hull in 18th.
