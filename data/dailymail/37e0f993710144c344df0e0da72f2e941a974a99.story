Lovingly cradling her new born baby twins, this mother has certainly got her hands full.

And the proud gorilla has a double cause for celebration, her new arrivals are an extremely rare occurrence in the captivity kept species.

According to experts, twin gorillas come along once every ten years in the world's zoos, making 20-year-old N'Gayla's brood something worth celebrating.

Proud mum: N'Gayla cradles the adorable twins which were an unexpected delivery at Bergers' Zoo, Holland

Clinging on: The twins will cling on to their mother for the first 18 months of their lives before roaming

Careful: No other gorillas will be able to hold or play with the twins until N'Gayla allows it, not even their dad

Staff at Bergers' Zoo in Arnhem knew that the imposing matriarch was expecting an infant, but they were stunned when, one morning, they discovered her gorilla holding the adorable duo.

The twins, a boy and a girl, will cling to their mother for the first 18 months of their lives, having little contact with any of the other species.

But once they are old enough to begin roaming, the great ape enclosure for themselves, other members of the group, including their 23-year-old dad, Bauwi, will be able to get to know their youngest playmates.

Wilco Limpers, head keeper of the 
great apes at Burgers' Zoo, said: 'In gorilla world, twins are very rare
because in the last fifty years, there has only been ten births.

'The father is not doing anything in the 
beginning, only sit next to her to protect her towards the others.

'When the youngsters are one and a half year old, they want to play and 
then he will play with them and that's quite nice to see.'

Youngest: The boy and girl are N'Galya's fourth and fifth but she will devote her time to the newborns

Telling smile: N'Gayla is said to be a 'good' and 'happy' mother by staff at the zoo in Arnhem, Holland

Wilco Limpers, head keeper of the great apes at the zoo, told RTV.

Limpers
told reporters that while the zoo knew N'Gayla was expecting, it was a 
complete shock when she was found one morning holding two newborns, a 
boy and a girl.

The 
twins will live with their family for eight to 10 years, before being 
sent to another zoo in order to prevent incest within the group.

Hitching a ride: N'Gayla will keep hold of the twins until they begin to climb trees and socialise with others
