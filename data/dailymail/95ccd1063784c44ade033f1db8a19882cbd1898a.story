Manchester City felt the full force of a sparkling Lionel Messi performance on Wednesday, prompting a debate over whether the Barcelona forward is the greatest player of all time.

Messi ripped apart the Premier League champions, with an array of nutmegs, dribbles and passes that demonstrated the 27-year-old, beaten by Cristiano Ronaldo to the Ballon d'Or in each of the last two years, is back on top of the world.

And the secret of his return to top form has now been revealed, with Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo claiming Messi is three and a half kilos lighter, making him sharper and more mobile.

'Leo has lost weight, has a new Italian dietician and is a regular in the gymnasium after training,' claims the paper, which also mentions a poll showing 85% of readers believe the Argentine is the greatest player ever.

Elsewhere in Spain there is focus on the Champions League draw, where AS claims 'Spain instills fear', and next weekend's Clasico, when Real Madrid face Barcelona.

Carlo Ancelotti is hoping to channel 'the spirit of Munich' this weekend at the Nou Camp, an attempt to repeat the remarkable performance of last year's Champions League semi final when they thrashed holders Bayern 4-0 away from home.

As part of that the Real Madrid boss intends to ask Gareth Bale to do a more defensive job, while relying on his central midfield stars to run the show.

In Italy Roma and Inter Milan are criticised for the press after losing at home in the Europa League on Thursday night.

La Gazzetta dello Sport call Inter 'the big flop' after they exited to Wolfsburg 4-1 on aggregate, while Corriere dello Sport focus on the 'Roma collapse'.
