Police in Wisconsin have begun an investigation after the body of a decorated and popular gymnast was found dead at the bottom of a restaurant dumb waiter connected to the kitchen on Monday.

Emergency services were called to WingDam Saloon & Grill in Fountain City at 8pm and pronounced Brooke Baures, 21, an employee there, dead at the scene.

Fountain City Police have said the death appears to be a bizarre accident, without elaborating, and said they have found no signs of foul play. 

Police Chief Jason Mork said the dumbwaiter's opening is about 3 feet by 3 feet and the service elevator connects the first and second floors.

Authorities say she was trapped in the small elevator when they arrived.

The exact cause and circumstances of the Wisconsin student's death have not been made public and officers said a medical examiner in Eau Claire will perform the autopsy on Tuesday. 

'There are no indicators of of a criminal act; however the investigation remains open for the purpose of investigative follow-up and an immediate autopsy,' said a spokesman for the Fountain City Police Department.

Police Chief Jason Mork said the Winona State University student was currently majoring in social work and expected to graduate next year.

The accomplished athlete was twice named the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference gymnast of the week earlier in 2014 and documented her athletics career enthusiastically on social media.

Her college paid tribute to Baures, who was an accomplished member of the gymnastics team from 2011 to 2014. 

'She was a leader on the team and a talented gymnast,' said WSU athletic director Eric Schoh in a statement. 'This is a tremendous loss for our community, and we ask that you keep Brooke and her family, friends, coaches and teammates in your thoughts.'

According to Police Chief Mork, the dumbwaiter which transfers food between the 2nd and 1st floors of the WingDam kitchen is obviously not designed for human use.

Place of work: This is the WingDam Saloon & Grill in Fountain City - where Brooke, who was an employee was found dead at 8pm on Monday

The opening is only three feet by three feet and the elevator works in a manner similar to a garage door, said Mork.

Amanda Schabacker, manager at WingDam Saloon & Grill, told the Winona Daily News the restaurant would be closed on Tuesday and refused to offer any more comment.

Her boyfriend, Joel Hinke was also a student at Winona and played for their football team the Winona State Warriors. 

Photographs posted to social media show Brooke and her family happily posing for pictures at Warriors games. 

Baures was also a huge music fan and on her Facebook page posted a picture on November 22 with herself and country music stars Dan + Shay along with the caption, 'OMG OMG'.

Tributes: Friends and family and fellow students posted their messages of goodwill and condolence to Twitter in the aftermath of Brooke's death 

Tributes from distraught friends have been flooding onto social media since her death was announced on December 1.

Friend Annelie Schmittel posted, 'Thoughts and prayers go out to the family of my former student Brooke Baures, as well as my WSU Warriors family. Devastating news.' 

According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, dumbwaiter accidents are rare. According to the OSHA database, only two incidents, both fatal, have happened in the U.S. between 2003 and 2013.
