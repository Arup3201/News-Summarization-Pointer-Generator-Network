'Fobbing off': Baroness Newlove, the Government's Victims' Commissioner criticised the police response to yobbish behaviour

Police are fobbing off sufferers of anti-social behaviour by asking them to write a diary of their experiences instead of taking action, the Government’s Victims’ Commissioner said last night.

Helen Newlove said those targeted by yobs were ‘living in fear’ and needed officers to take action.

She claimed police had not learned from the deaths of victims Fiona Pilkington and David Askew.

Mrs Pilkington killed herself and her disabled daughter in 2007 by setting fire to their car after officers ignored a campaign of terror against them.

The 38-year-old mother complained repeatedly about the abuse. Mr Askew, 64, had a mental age of ten and was ‘tormented to death’ in 2010 by youths who harassed him for more than a decade in Hattersley, Greater Manchester.

Police had been called to his house ten times in the previous year over reports of anti-social behaviour.

Baroness Newlove – whose husband Garry was killed by a drunken mob outside their home in Warrington, Cheshire, in 2007 – said she  struggled to make police understand that anti-social behaviour was serious and victims needed proper support.

She added: ‘Don’t just give them a diary to fill in, because that’s an irritant in itself. If you’re being really traumatised you haven’t got the energy to fill it in.

‘We have to learn lessons of Fiona Pilkington, we have to learn the  lessons of David Askew. You don’t learn any more lessons by losing somebody else.’

She said that despite Government efforts to crack down, there were still 2.3million victims of yobbish behaviour every year.

Baroness Newlove added: ‘We have got to recognise anti-social behaviour is a huge issue - 2.3million victims is a hell of a lot.’

She also dismissed a new law  known as 
the ‘community trigger’ that forces police to respond after someone 
makes three complaints in six months.

'Learn the lessons': Baroness Newlove said police must take into account examples like Fiona Pilkington, left, who killed herself after police ignored her plight, and David Askew, right, who was killed by youths he confronted over the havoc they caused outside his house

She said: ‘Actually it’s about the first call. You do not wait for three. Anti-social behaviour isn’t a low-level crime. Garry died from anti-social behaviour – and then it was a murder.’

Mr Newlove was set upon by a gang of up to 15 youths when he went to remonstrate with them for causing havoc outside the family’s home.

He died two days later in hospital and three teenagers were convicted of his murder.

Made a Tory peer by David Cameron and charged with representing victims, Baroness Newlove said many complainants were intimidated by the criminal justice system, adding: ‘It is very cold and clinical. We need to make it more human.’
