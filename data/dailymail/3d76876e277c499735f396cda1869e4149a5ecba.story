They were once the 'his and hers' cars of Prince Charles and Princess Diana.

And now buyers with big pockets can own a slice of royal history as the two vehicles are coming up for auction in Ascot, Berkshire.

Car collectors have the choice of the 1991 Bentley Turbo RL owned by HRH Prince Charles or a 2.5l Audi Quatro owned by Diana, Princess of Wales - or both.

Up for sale: Princess Diana's Audi Quatro will be sold to the highest bidder at auction in Ascot

The Bentley is already one of the most desirable luxury cars on the market, and will be even more valuable for its royal pedigree.

The auction comes after bidders from around the world vied to purchase the late Princess' gowns, as ten went under the hammer.

One buyer paid £240,000 for the off-the-shoulder velvet Victor Edelstein dress,
Kerry Taylor Auctions said, which was among ten of the princess’s dresses auctioned yesterday for 
almost £900,000.

Memorabilia: Auctions of Princess Diana's belongings usually make for fierce bidding

Bidders from Asia, the US, Europe and Australia competed at a London 
auction house to buy what were described as a ‘slice of history’.

The dresses were originally sold by the Princess herself, just a month 
before her death in August 1997.

Prince William had suggested she 
auction them to raise money for charity.

Businesswoman Maureen Rorech Dunkel from Florida had bought the dresses including a black halterneck dress she wore at Versailles and a Bruce Oldfield gown, in dramatic black velvet, which she wore to the première of Les Misérables in London in 1995 as an 
investment.

After Diana’s death, she exhibited them to raise money for 
charity but then sold them after she filed for bankruptcy in 2010.

On 
Tuesday they were being auctioned by an anonymous seller.

The cars will be sold through Coys of Kensington auctioneers.

In January Coys sold Freddie Mercury's Rolls Royce Phantom for six times its guide price to a Russian businessman who paid £74, 600.
