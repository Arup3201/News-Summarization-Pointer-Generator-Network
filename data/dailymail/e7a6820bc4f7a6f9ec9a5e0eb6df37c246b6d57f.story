It takes a certain type of person to apply for a one-way ticket to Mars.

Not only will they require mental and physical strength, but now, they will also need to have the makings of the next reality-TV star.

Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, has announced that it will document the progress of a group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet.

The reality series will follow the selection process of the privately-funded Mars One mission, which aims to launch 20 humans on Mars within the next decade.

During the first selection round, more than 200,000 people signed up to be part of the first human colony on the red planet.

The Mars One project plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as 
soon as October 2016. 

A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018.

The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are 
used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips
 ‘much safer than moon missions’.

The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade.

Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days.

The applicants have now been shortlisted to 705 candidates - 418 men and 287 women - who will will undergo what is described as 'the world's toughest job interview'.

Darlow Smithson Productions (DSP), an Endemol company, will film the hopefuls as they are ‘tested to the extreme as part of an elite training programme’.

Candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and a Big Brother-style audience vote will be used to make the final choice.

Any chosen Mars settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million-mile pioneering mission.

The ticket is one-way and Mars One plans to send additional crews every two years to expand the colony. 

DSP said its production will be seen around the world, with the first series likely to be appearing in early 2015. An artist illustration of a communication satellite on Mars is pictured, on the red planet. The satellite is part of the wider Mars One mission set to launch in January 2018

DSP said its production will be seen around the world, with the first series likely to be appearing in early 2015.

The plan is for the cameras to also follow the first human settlers on the planet as they attempt to build a new society from scratch.

‘Our team felt all along that we needed a partner whose strength lies in factual storytelling to an international audience,’ Mars One co-founder Bas Lansdorp said in a statement.

‘DSP will provide that to Mars One, while allowing our selection committee to maintain control of the applicant selection process.’

There will be some spaceflight tests before the first launch of humans toward Mars.

For instance, Mars One plans to launch several unmanned missions in the next 10 years to prepare the ground for the arrival of the colonists.

A robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018, followed by a scouting rover in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022.

The majority of applicants for the one-way trip to Mars came from the US, with India and China coming in second and third place.

The second round will include an interview with Mars One committee members, and candidates advancing to the third round will compete against one another.

The third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates for the potential mission and will be broadcast on television and online.

A father of four, who applied for a 
one-way-ticket to live on Mars, could be looking at a divorce as a 
result of his extraterrestrial ambition.

Ken
 Sullivan made it the next stage of the Mars One project, which could 
potentially see him making a new life on Mars – but his wife and 
children are not happy about the news.

Mr
 Sullivan, who lives in Utah, is among the 1,058 applicants selected so 
far who could colonise the red planet and never return to their families
 and friends on Earth.

While the 38-year-old might be excited
 about his potential ticket to an extraterrestrial life, his wife of 
five-and-a-half years, Becky, is contemplating getting a divorce.

‘The
 question is do we get divorced now or get divorced later. If I stand in
 the way of his dreams and passions, then we get divorced now, so I have
 to be supportive,’ she told The Salt Lake Tribune.

If
 he did make the final cut to live on Mars, Mr Sullivan would also have 
to leave behind his four children, who range in age from just six months
 to 13-years-old.

His 
12-year-old daughter Kaitlyn is upset at the idea she might never see 
her father in person again and said that she would miss him, yet her 
older sister Jocelyn told the newspaper: ‘If he wants to go to Mars, he 
should go to Mars.’
