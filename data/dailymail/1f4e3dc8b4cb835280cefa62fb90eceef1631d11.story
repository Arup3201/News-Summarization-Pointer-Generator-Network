A senior citizen had a stroke of bad luck after she was the victim of a robbery while shopping - then hours later had her purse swiped on the way to the police station to report the first crime.

Harriet Sweger, 72, was shopping at Big Lots, a discount retailer, in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania when a female customer bumped into her and lifted the check book from her purse.

The thief ran out of the door, leaving Ms Sweger in a panic.

Twice in one day: Harriet Sweger, 72, was robbed twice in the span of a few hours and wonders 'Is there a tag of me or what?'

Frightened: The senior citizen is now scared to go about her daily routine. 'I don't know where you can go to be safe anymore,' she said

The elderly woman then decided to go to the local police station, in nearby Stowe Township, to report the theft - when she was the victim of another robbery.

She had pulled her car over to the side of the road to ask directions from a male pedestrian. The man then reached into her car and grabbed her handbag, which was sitting on the passenger seat.

'I was scared to death. I mean you should have seen the way he snatched it and started running like hell,' a frightened Sweger told WPXI-TV News

Sweger still canâ€™t imagine how she could be victimized like this.

'I was robbed twice. I said, ''Is there a tag on me or what?'''

Scam: Ms Sweger was shopping at this discount store when a woman stole her check book

Robbery #2: The elderly woman says a male pedestrian grabbed her purse out of her car (pictured) when she pulled over to ask for directions to the local police station in Stowe Township, Pennsylvania

She has put a hold on her bank card and account but is unsure of the financial damage of both crimes.

Police say the check book was returned to Big Lots and they say a purse was found but they did not specify if it belonged to Sweger. Sweger is now trying to cope with overcoming her fears after the crime wave.

'I don't know what to do,' she said, wondering, 'I don't know where you can go to be safe anymore.'
