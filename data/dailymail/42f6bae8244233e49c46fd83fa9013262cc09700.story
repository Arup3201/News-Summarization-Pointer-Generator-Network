AstraZeneca is facing mounting pressure from its shareholders to do a deal to sell itself to US rival Pfizer, it emerged last night.

Days after it rejected a £69billion bid for the company, the British drug maker’s largest investor has urged it to return to the negotiating table.

US mega-fund Blackrock, which owns a 7.8per cent stake in the company, has told the board it was wrong to walk away from talks.

Pensions funds and wealth managers accounting for around a sixth of its shares are believed to have urged the company’s board of directors to re-open talks with the US predator.

US mega-fund Blackrock, which owns a 7.8per cent stake in AstraZeneca, has told the board it was wrong to walk away from talks.

Earlier this week Astra rejected Pfizer’s ‘final’ £69billion offer of £55 a share.

The move all but guaranteed its independence because Pfizer is now banned from hiking its offer any further under UK takeover law.

But in three months’ time the legal ban expires, which would allow the Astra board to re-engage with the American company.

While Pfizer is not allowed to approach AstraZeneca unsolicited for at least six months, the British group can open fresh talks as early as August.

It is widely expected that Astra will face increased pressure to try and strike a deal.

The proposed takeover would be the largest ever of a UK firm by a foreign company.

But the deal has been widely criticised by scientists, City investors and MPs.

Astra’s chief executive Pascal Soriot told MPs the takeover risked delaying the development of life-saving drugs that Astra is currently working on.

Pfizer has also been criticised for its takeover motives, which is to help whittle down its international tax bill by moving its base out of the US.

The US predator has almost 200 offshoots in tax havens, accounting for almost 40per cent of its international subsidiaries.

According to reports, Blackrock told company directors they were right to reject the £55 a share offer, but said they should return to the deal-making table as soon as possible.

The shareholder joins a chorus of critics that also include major investors AXA, Legal & General and Schroders.

But other significant investors, such as Fidelity and M&G, have backed the board’s decision to terminate the negotiations.

Blackrock, AstraZeneca and Pfizer all refused to comment.
