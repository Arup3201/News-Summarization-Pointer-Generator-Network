Next time you reach into your Mulberry tote to grab your purse, you could be putting yourself in danger of catching a serious - and potentially deadly - disease.

According to new research, E.coli, poisonous bacteria and even traces of faeces have been found lurking at the bottom of women’s handbags, as well as on the average laptop and gym bag.

The study - which took swabs from inside a selection of women's handbags - found evidence of deadly food poisoning-inducing bacteria E.coli and faecal Streptococcus, which can cause pneumonia and bacterial meningitis.

More worrying still, researchers found traces of Coliforms, from the faeces of man and warm-blooded animals, which can lead to bloody stools, stomach cramps and diarrhea.

As well as Pseudomonas, which is found in soil, plant water, plants and animals and is the second most common form of infection in hospitalised patients.

The study also published information on the participants' handbag habits and revealed that 33 per cent of women never clean their bags.

Many people admitted too that they carry dirty underwear and used tissues in their bag every day.

It will come as unwelcome news to the fifth of those questioned who admitted that they often chew a piece of gum they find lurking loose in their handbag before a date or job interview - and confessed to blowing fluff off the piece to 'clean it' before they pop it in their mouths.

Claire Powley, from Mentos Gum, who carried out the research, said: 'Our research results prove extremely shocking, particularly as so many of us wouldn’t think twice about eating loose gum found in the bottom of our bag, completely unaware to the harmful bacteria we are putting into our mouths at the same time.'
