Angela Merkel made a passionate plea for Britain not to quit the EU yesterday but suggested David Cameron can hope to achieve only limited reform before a referendum.

The German Chancellor used a visit to London to back the Prime Minister’s calls for a clampdown on EU migrants’ right to claim benefits and indicated the UK and non-eurozone countries could win concessions as the eurozone integrates further.

But she warned she would disappoint British calls for her to commit now to fundamental reform of the EU – and dodged any promise of the full-scale treaty changes.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear to David Cameron that British demands for fundamental reform of the EU would not be met

Mr Cameron had seen Mrs Merkel as key ally in his hopes of clawing back powers from Brussels

After a speech, lunch and press conference, Mrs Merkel travelled to Buckingham Palace for a meeting with the Queen

Mrs Merkel claimed she was ‘caught 
between the devil and the deep blue sea’, with some countries demanding 
massive changes and others insisting Europe must not ‘pay almost any 
price’ to keep Britain in the union.

But
 accommodating Britain’s demands could be done, she said. Mrs Merkel was
 treated like a visiting monarch as she called on Mr Cameron in Downing 
Street.

The 
government rolled out the red carpet for Mrs Merkel, whose support is seen as pivotal to Mr Cameron’s hopes 
of securing reform of Brussels.

She was afforded the
 rare honour of making a speech to both Houses of Parliament, gathered 
together in the Lords, and later visited the Queen at Buckingham Palace.

In her address, she suggested Britain could not expect to be treated as
 a special case and warned those expecting her to promise a fundamental 
shake-up of the EU at this stage would be disappointed.

However,
 she was more positive when asked in Downing Street whether she would 
support Mr Cameron’s attempts to negotiate a looser, more trade-based 
relationship with Brussels ahead of a referendum the Tories have 
committed to holding in 2017 if they are still in power.

‘I
 firmly believe that what we are discussing here is feasible, is 
doable,’ she said after a 90-minute meeting over lunch in the Prime 
Minister’s Downing Street flat. ‘Where there’s a will there’s a way.’

German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted Europe does need to reform but she would disappoint many demands from Britain

Mrs Merkel addressed MPs and peers from both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster

British Prime Minister David Cameron: 'We need fundamental, far-reaching change.'(January 2013)

Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel: 'I have heard some expect my speech to pave for a fundamental 
reform of the European architecture which will satisfy all kinds of 
alleged or actual British wishes. I am afraid they are in for a 
disappointment.' (February 2014)

She
 also suggested that she agreed freedom of movement rules should be 
amended to restrict rights to claim benefits, saying it was wrong that a
 new immigrant could claim the same level of handouts as people who had 
paid into the system for several years.

‘That
 would not be the interpretation of freedom of movement that I would 
have,’ she said. ‘That is just as much of a headache for us in Germany 
as it is for the British people.’

She
 suggested she was ready to agree reforms that would mean new rights for
 countries who are not members of the single currency.

‘If
 one wants Britain to remain in the European Union – which is what I 
want – if one at the same time wants a competitive union... one can find
 common solutions.’

However, Mrs Merkel warned Mr Cameron that it would not be a ‘piece of cake’ for changes to be agreed across the EU.

She
 also said that Germany was grateful to Britain for placing trust in her
 country following the Second World War and ‘the break in civilisation’ 
represented by the Holocaust.

Speaking
 in the anniversary year of the outbreak of the First World War, she 
said: ‘This is a special year of commemoration for Britain, where you 
remember your dead, your losses and the untold suffering that Germany 
brought through these wars to you.

‘As German Chancellor, I bow my head before the victims of these horrible wars.’

Prime Minister David Cameron smiled during the speech, but there was little sign of a major breakthrough in his demands for reform. Picture (left to right) Foreign Secretary William Hague, Leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley, Labour leader Ed Miliband, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Cameron

Eurosceptic
 Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said: ‘What Angela Merkel said came as 
no surprise. She wasn’t going to suddenly offer a whole load of 
concessions.

‘What’s 
important is how good relations are between David Cameron and Angela 
Merkel. He has vetoed a treaty, promised an in/out referendum, cut the 
EU budget against everyone’s wishes, and still Angela Merkel comes over 
here and is extremely friendly and positive.’

Tory
 MP John Baron, another Eurosceptic, was less convinced, saying: ‘She 
made it clear the direction of travel is “more Europe” – closer economic
 and political integration.’

The lavish reception for Mrs Merkel was in stark contrast to the welcome given to French President Francois Hollande last month.

On
 a windswept RAF base, Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande publicly disagreed 
about the need for EU reform before heading for a low key lunch at a 
village pub.

Mr Hollande 
said giving the British people a say on leaving the European Union was 
'not urgent' and insisted he would do little to assist Mr Cameron's push
 for reform.

'We feel that revising the Treaty is not a priority for the time being,’ Mr Hollande added.

French President Francois Hollande insisted reforming Europe was 'not urgent' during an awkward meeting with Mr Cameron. The two men later endured a low key pub lunch but the Frenchman appeared to want a
 quick getaway

Douglas
 Alexander, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman, said: ‘Chancellor 
Merkel’s remarks have confirmed that David Cameron’s approach to Europe 
just isn’t working.’

But Labour MP Austin Mitchell said Mrs Merkel has also created a big problem for Labour.

It
 was clear, he said, that the choice for Britain was to ‘join the euro 
and central group or be relegated to periphery’. ‘Miliband can’t accept 
either,’ he added.
