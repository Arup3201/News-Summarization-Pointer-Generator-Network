The Isle of Man might be known for its famous TT motorbike race, but it is also a haven for stargazers.

Despite being just 32 miles long and 14 miles wide, the island has been named as one of Britain's best places to see the night sky.

And now one photographer has released a dazzling time-lapse video that he created by filming the sky at different local landmarks around the island over a period of 10 months.

Astronomers from the Dark Sky Discovery Network awarded the Isle of Man a total of 26 designated Dark Sky Discovery Sites earlier this month, putting it up 
there in terms of status with Death Valley in the U.S.

It is thought that more than 85 per cent of the UK population have never seen a truly dark sky due to light pollution, the quiet Isle of Man provides the perfect sky for those keen to stargaze.

Glenn Whorral, who was worn on the island, shot the footage on Canon DSLR cameras with different lenses.

'Over
 the course of the whole project I shot around 18,000 stills and the 
best compositions made it into the final edit,' he said.

He
 took the photographs April to October last year and set the cameras up 
to capture the skies over night, sometimes sleeping in his car.

Angela Byrne, head of tourism on the Isle of Man said: 'To have one site given Dark Sky Discovery status is an honour, but to have 26 in total is quite unbelievable.

Measuring about 440 yds (400metres) long from west to east, it is connected to the Langness Peninsula by a narrow causeway

longest river on the island

'Our little Island is a world away from the bright lights of the mainland's big cities, and we really hope that this accolade inspires people to visit us and experience our incredible surroundings, which of course includes the night sky.'

Howard Parkin, who runs his own 
astronomy consultancy and is chairman of the Isle of Man Astronomical 
Society, added: 'It's great news that the Isle of Man now has so many 
Dark Sky Discovery Sites because they are so rare around the rest of 
Britain.

'With light levels 
so low, the night sky on the Isle of Man really will amaze anyone who 
takes the time to look up, from the novice to the seasoned professional.'

Mr Whorral waited for the perfect dry and clear weather conditions to take his photographs.

'It was oftenÂ  very 
cold though,' he said.

'The shoot up at Smeale in the north of the Island was very
 windy and as I walked back to the car I could see a number of fishing
 boats had come right in close to the shore to shelter from the wind - 
quite an unexpected and amazing sight.'

Despite the cold, he said: 'My favourite shot is from
 Smeale beach with the grass silhouetted in the foreground because you 
can see the milky way almost perfectly.

'And my 
favourite shoot was at Maughold Head as it was a perfectly still and 
peaceful night and I remember being sat at the foot of the lighthouse 
waiting for the sequence to finish and I could hear the seals talking to
 each other from the cliffs below,' he added.

Among the other sites in England mentioned by the discovery channel are Kielder Forest Observatory in Northumberland, the Queen Elizabeth Country Park in Hampshire and the WaterWorks Nature Reserve in Lee Valley Regional Park.

In Wales the Mountain Centre at Libanus near Brecon in Powys is mentioned and there are 12 in Scotland, nine of which are on Skye and Lochalsh.

Niarbyl, which means 'the tail' in Manx for the way it extends into 
the Irish Sea, is a settlement along the southwest coast of Isle of Man 
between Port Erin and Peel. It is best known for its spectacular sea 
views - and now its clear skies
