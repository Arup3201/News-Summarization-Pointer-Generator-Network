West Bromwich Albion have received ‘no enquiries whatsoever’ for Saido Berahino, according to head coach Alan Irvine.

Tottenham and Liverpool have been heavily linked with the England Under 21 striker, but neither have registered an interest with his Midlands club.

Talks over a new, improved contract following his impressive start to the season have been curtailed as Berahino looks to regain his starting role.

Berahino has scored eight goals in 20 games for the Baggies so far this season

He has started the last three games on the bench after suffering a dip in form following a start to the campaign where he scored seven Premier League goals before November.

Irvine predicted Berahino would stay at The Hawthorns after the January window closes. ‘At the moment it is certainly only speculation. We have had no enquiries whatsoever,’ he said.

‘Where the stories have come from I’m not quite sure. January will reveal what is going to happen.

‘We may well get some offers for Saido and if we do the club will deal with them.

‘The chairman has already said he doesn’t want to sell Saido in January so I’m guessing nothing has changed as far as that is concerned.’

Alan Irvine remains adamant Berahino will not be sold during the January transfer window
