Sprouts have certainly earned themselves a bad rep, falling out of favour with kids and grownups alike.

The miniature vegetables have long been a staple on British dinner plates and also the subject of many a heated debate for their 'love them or hate them' qualities.

But despite their reluctant popularity on home shores they have never been a best-seller in America - until now.

UK growers have developed the kalette, a cross breed of sprouts and the popular superfood kale

However, in a bid to get the cabbage-like vegetable back on the menu, cunning British growers have found a way to make it appeal to the trendy foodie. 

British experts have spent 15 years working tirelessly to perfect a tastier and more appealing version of the classic Brussels sprout by cross-breeding it with kale.

The leafy green superfood has become extremely trendy in recent years enjoyed by A-listers such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Miranda Kerr.

Growers first began developing the idea in 1995 but didn't begin selling the veg in the UK until 2010

The new creations, called kalettes, taste milder and sweeter than Brussels sprouts but growers had a battle on their hands to make US buyers see past the vegetable's stuffy, old-fashioned image. 

They are the brainchild of independent Surrey growers Tozer Seeds, who began working on developing better-tasting Brussels in 1995. 

As well as tasting better than the average Brussels sprout, kalettes are also extremely hardy and produce heavy crops even through the coldest of winters.

Unlike Brussels sprouts, which are typically boiled, kalettes can be steamed, roasted, stir-fried, grilled, microwaved or even raw.

They hit the shelves in the UK in 2010 under the name 'flower sprouts' but have only just been launched in the US. 

Since hitting the American market in October the new creations have been flying off the shelves. They have proved such a hit that growers have had to step up production to try to meet the demand.

Kalettes have since appeared in magazines such as Time and Elle, in papers like the New York Times and on national news programmes such as Fox News. 

Kalettes are a crossed between sprouts and kale and promise a sweeter-tasting vegetable

David Rogers, from Tozer Seeds, says that despite their recent popularity kalettes have been around for almost 20 years.

'Kalettes came about initially from experiments we carried out in 1995 to create new vegetables by cross breeding them.

'We found that the results of breeding Brussels sprouts and kale were particularly good, with a great taste and a great look - milder in flavour than a Brussels sprout with more attractive leaves.' 

Kalettes hit the US market back in October and have become so popular that growers have had to up their production in order to keep on top of the demand

David said that although the initial idea was developed it took years of work before they perfected the vegetable.  

Both Brussels sprouts and kale belong to the Brassica family of vegetables which also includes broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, horseradish, turnip, radish and cress.

Brassica vegetables are renowned for their ability to be cross-bred with one another, which occurs because they are all derivatives of a wild cabbage that existed 5,000 years ago.

The Latin name for the Brussels sprout is Brassica oleracea gemmifera while kale is Brassica oleracea acephala. 

'But in growing it takes years and years to refine the product and get to a point where they can be mass produced and sold,' he said.

'We started talking to growers and supermarkets in 2005 and the feedback was positive but it takes a lot to launch a new vegetable that no-one's ever heard of before.'

After 15 years in the making the developers of the vegetable were thrilled when the product was met with huge success after being launched in the UK.  

'Our creation finally hit the shelves in the UK in 2010 under the name "flower sprouts" and was a real hit.

'British people tend to view Brussels sprouts are seen as a very old fashioned vegetable that are typically boiled. They're a real Marmite vegetable - certain people love them but a lot of people don't.

'We certainly felt flower sprouts would be more appealing to the modern customer.'

When launching the vegetable overseas the marketers sought out a name to appeal to foodies. 

'Historically Brussels sprouts have been popular in western European countries but not a big seller in America.

'Our marketing agency in the States cleverly ditched the name 'sprouts' and rebranded them 'kalettes' to capitalise on the popularity of kale as a superfood.'

Since the kalettes arrived in America the growers have been overwhelmed with their popularity. 

'We only launched kalettes in October but they have been flying off the shelves across the US. Everyone's going crazy for them. 

'More by luck than judgement, here we are 20 years on with a hit product made from kale, the trendiest vegetable on the market today.

'We never thought that when we began our experiments all those years ago we would have found success across the pond with the humble sprout.'
