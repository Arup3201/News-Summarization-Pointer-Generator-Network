It has become the Barclays Premier League fixture of the season... So Sportsmail invited JAMIE REDKNAPP, MARTIN KEOWN and GRAHAM POLL to discuss the big incidents from Manchester City v Chelsea. Head of Sport LEE CLAYTON listened in.

KEOWN: Fernandinho’s absence is a big loss for City. I don’t fancy  Martin Demichelis in midfield at all. In fact, it makes me think I might put my boots back on! There’s a chance for Chelsea here. How bold will they be?

REDKNAPP: There will be a lot of people tuning in, hoping for Jose to fail in this game. After his unfair criticism of West Ham, the rest of football was looking on, saying: ‘OK, let’s see what you’ve got then...’ My dad thinks Chelsea win this. Not many others do.

POLL: You can see the tension in the game and what it means to both teams. Vincent Kompany just got away with a strong tackle from behind on Samuel Eto’o, then screamed at his partner Matija Nastasic. I don’t recall you falling out with any of your defensive partners, Martin. Not much, anyway.

On skis: Sportsmail imagines Chelsea winger Eden Hazard on skis

Brilliant: The Belgian was unstoppable in a crucial 1-0 win for the Blues at the Etihad

What a strike: Branislav Ivanovic scored the only goal of the game with a great left-footed strike in the first half

Jubilant: Ivanovic and the impressive Nemanja Matic celebrate the goal

KEOWN: Only occasionally! That was Kompany, the captain, feeling a little hot under the collar. This has the feel of a huge game.  Ramires looks a threat on the break to me. City will have to deal with that. Remember that game in Barcelona when he was such a threat going forward?

15mins: No team have kept a clean sheet at City’s stadium since Birmingham in November 2010. Have Chelsea come to defend? ‘Are you West Ham in disguise?’ mock the City fans.

REDKNAPP: I’m loving this start. It’s fast and furious but with quality. The passing is so crisp. Yaya Toure just set up a chance for David Silva, who should have scored. Sergio Aguero would have scored that.

POLL: Interesting, that. Players are criticised for going down too easily, but Yaya stayed on his feet running into the box when there was close attention. He might have gone down.

Beaten: Joe Hart was powerless to stop the powerful strike

Mixed emotions: Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini watch the action unfold

Ulucky: Matic sees a brilliant 30 yard shot rattle back off the crossbar

REDKNAPP: City work so hard without the ball. They hunt from the front. They press high and they have energy without the ball. You’d class David Silva as a luxury player, but he puts some miles in chasing the ball. They have a problem, though, because Demichelis is out of his depth in there. He’s not a midfielder.

KEOWN: When Chelsea spring forward, City are missing the wheels of Fernandinho to cover and protect. They are exposed. Mourinho has set up a team to do a job at both ends of the pitch, but Eto’o doesn’t have the power he once had, which is a  weakness for Chelsea. Imagine Luis Suarez in this team. Mourinho has been ruthless in his selection, leaving out Oscar, but Willian is making up for it with his energy. 

Agonising: David Silva lays on the floor after narrowly missing a late chance

Struggles: Yaya Toure failed to have the same impact without Fernandinho next to him

REDKNAPP: We talk about financial fair play, but Fernandinho’s value is going up with every Chelsea attack. Chelsea have just had a four-v-two situation and they are beginning to get a grip on the game. They have not come to park the bus at all. They’ve come to win. It really does look as though Mourinho has got his team selection spot on.

32mins: Ivanovic 1-0.

REDKNAPP: Fantastic technique from Eden Hazard to set up that chance . . . he is becoming as important to this team as Suarez is to Liverpool. Or Aguero is to City. And he’s only 22.

KEOWN: That goal was about intent,  Jamie. Did you see there were five Chelsea players in attacking areas? The game plan is working perfectly. City need to get the ball into their front two more quickly. We haven’t seen enough of Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko so far.

POLL: We haven’t seen much of any City players since the early exchanges. Nothing to do with officiating, but how poor are City? If Mike Dean was performing this badly, there would be outrage. 

Sliding in: Matija Nastasic makes a diving challenge on Ramires

Strong challenge: John Terry attempts to make a tackle on Zabaleta

Shoulder to Shoulder: Yaya Toure (left) attempts to wrest the ball from Willian

REDKNAPP: Dzeko got a little bang early on from John Terry and we haven’t seen much of him since. I can’t believe Chelsea are making Terry wait for a new contract, he’s getting better with age. He’s the best centre back in the country. Give him a new deal, before someone else does! The referee has given himself a problem, though. Four bookings and that Nemanja Matic yellow was so unnecessary. I don’t know why they do it.

POLL: I disagree 100 per cent! Mike Dean has tried to be selective but that hasn’t worked. Now he’s trying to calm the game down with bookings. This is one of those refereeing performances that won’t be appreciated by fans — or former players, including you two — but Dean has tried to give individuals every chance to play football. He could have shown three early yellows but didn’t. When the tempo was increased he correctly cautioned four players and if that means a player is sent off for a second caution that is their  problem and not his.

45mins: Chelsea 1-0 up at the break.

Ineffective: Alvaro Negredo (left) was surprisingly taken off for Stevan Jovetic

Fish out of water: Demichelis struggled in his holding midfield role

REDKNAPP: Demichelis is like a fish out of water. He’s out of his depth in there and the game is passing him by. 

KEOWN: Jose’s game plan has been executed brilliantly. They have so much pace in midfield. My only criticism of Chelsea is that they should have scored more. With Demichelis in there, it’s like City are playing one in midfield. Yaya is brilliant, but he’s in no hurry to rush back, so the defence is wide open to numbers advancing. The team who win the title will be the team with the best balance.

60mins: Chelsea hit the woodwork for a third time...

Dominating: Chelsea hit the woodwork three times on their way to victory

Like a Rolls-Royce: January signing Nemanja Matic was brilliant in the centre of midfield

REDKNAPP: If this was a boxing match, it would have been stopped.

POLL: David Luiz is lucky to escape a yellow card for that challenge on Stevan Jovetic. You can’t say Dean has been been card-happy, Jamie! He called it right when Nastasic fouled Oscar, too. There is no reference to ‘last defender’ in law and it must be a clear and obvious goal-scoring opportunity denied. That wasn’t. Dean has been excellent.

REDKNAPP: No, Matic has been excellent! When I saw the teams, I was surprised to see him there, but he’s looked like a Rolls-Royce.

Right call: Referee Mike Dean was correct not to send Nastasic off for his foul on Oscar as it wasn't a clear goalscoring opportunity

Twinkle toes: Manchester City struggled to handle Hazard's pace and directness

KEOWN: I can’t get carried away with Matic. He’s been very good, but Hazard is the one for me. If you put a pair of skis on Hazard, he’d win a gold at the Winter Olympics with his slalom-like dribbles. He’s my man of the match. His balance is beautiful and he’s cunning too. And Ramires is like a long-distance runner, the Mo Farah of the Chelsea team. Every Chelsea player has been on his ‘A’ game. That’s what Mourinho demands, that’s what he got.

REDKNAPP: Chelsea have been magnificent. Jose has done a number on us all. That is what he does — he comes to life in these big games. Chelsea have kept clean sheets at United, Arsenal and City now, but this wasn’t just about defending, though Terry and Gary Cahill were superb. Let’s praise Mourinho for that. We don’t always give him credit, but this is a night when he deserves it.

Job well done: Terry and Cahill celebrate at the final whistle

Dejected: Toure and Edin Dzeko leave the pitch off after a tough defeat

Final word: Jose Mourinho celebrates after a huge result in the title race
