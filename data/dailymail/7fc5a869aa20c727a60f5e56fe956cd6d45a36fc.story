A 26-year-old Polish woman disfigured by a huge tumour has received a new face.

The woman, identified only as Joanna, was given the new face during the country's second face transplant.

Prior to the operation, she struggled to chew, swallow or talk.

Joanna had 23-hours of surgery to give her a new face. During the operation, 80 per cent of the skin on her face was replaced

Dr Adam Maciejewski, who led the 23-hour surgery last week, said he hopes the transplant of 80 per cent of the skin on her face will give her back those functions.

Joanna was severely deformed by neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along the nerves.

The condition can also cause bone problems, pressure on the spinal nerves, severe pain, learning disabilities and vision and hearing problems. There is no cure for it.

Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born.

Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious.

Joanna is currently in serious but 
stable condition after the operation at the Cancer Centre and Institute 
of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland.

The facial tumour will not recur because the skin on her new face is from different genes, genetics expert Dr Anand Saggar told MailOnline. 

In May, Dr Maciejewski and his 
colleagues performed Poland's first face transplant on a man whose face 
was torn off by a stone mason's machine. His recovery is said to be 
progressing.

The man's operation took 27 hours and was carried out just weeks after his accident.

It was thought to be the first face transplant to be carried out so soon after the damage had occurred - previous transplants have taken months, or even years, to prepare.

Difficult: Before the operation, Joanna struggled to chew, swallow or speak. Following the surgery she can now do all these things again

The man had to have his jaw, palate and eye sockets reconstructed.

The world's first full-face transplant was carried out on a Spanish farmer in March 2010.

Oscar had blown most of his face off with a gun during a hunting accident and was left unable to breathe, swallow or talk properly.
