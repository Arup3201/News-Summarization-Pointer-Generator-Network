Angelina Jolie has been made a dame by William Hague.

The starstruck Foreign Secretary, who has spent most of the week at the Hollywood actress’s side, bestowed the surprise accolade on her as part of the Queen’s birthday honours.

The pair have been working closely together at a summit on rape in London – despite the escalating political and military crises in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine.

Speech: The actress, a UN Special Envoy, talks to those attending the summit. The honour recognises her 'extraordinary' work to stamp out rape as a weapon in war zones

Miss Jolie, the 39-year-old star of Tomb Raider, said: ‘It means a great deal to me.’

But eyebrows were raised at the headline-grabbing damehood, which seals two years of growing friendship between the A-list actress and Mr Hague.

As an American citizen, it is highly unusual that Miss Jolie has received an honour from Britain.

Foreigners are occasionally awarded them – there was an honorary knighthood for Bob Geldof, who is Irish, after Live Aid.

Labour MP Paul Flynn said that giving a top award to a celebrity with friends in high places rather than an unsung British hero undermined the credibility of the honours system.

‘The honours system is becoming increasingly discredited and this is another step in that direction,’ he said.

‘Angelina Jolie is doing creditable work but it is ridiculous to honour people who are already over-endowed with privileges and wealth.’

Critics also said damehoods are usually bestowed later in life, after a recipient has earned a lower honour such as an OBE or a CBE.

The honour to Miss Jolie, a UN Special Envoy, recognises her ‘extraordinary’ work to stamp out rape as a weapon in war zones, culminating in a landmark international summit in London to tackle the menace.

Mr Hague said she thoroughly deserved the award because she had ‘made a real difference and achieved lasting results’, referring to the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative the pair launched in 2012.

Miss Jolie said: ‘To receive an honour related to foreign policy means a great deal to me, as it is what I wish to dedicate my working life to.’

She becomes an honorary Dame Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George.

It is awarded to those who ‘render extraordinary or important non-military service in a foreign country’.

It can also be conferred for important or loyal service in relation to foreign and Commonwealth affairs.

Mr Hague and Miss Jolie have made a number of visits to war zones around the world together.

The Foreign Secretary has seemed bewitched by the actress all week, with he and David Cameron looking like awestruck schoolboys when they welcomed her to Britain on Tuesday.

Mr Hague gushed that she was ‘a pleasure to work with’, and said her ‘power to speak to the whole world’ and his ‘levers of decision-making and action’ were a formidable combination.

Whitehall officials confirmed Miss Jolie’s damehood was an honour ‘from the Foreign Office ... for services to UK foreign policy and the campaign to end war zone sexual violence’.

The Foreign Office refused to confirm it was Mr Hague who had nominated Miss Jolie.

Working together: Mr Hague was all smiles as he appeared at the closing session of the summit with Miss Jolie, who wore a grey kimono-style dress

Yesterday Mr Hague was all smiles as he appeared at the closing session of the summit with Miss Jolie, who wore a grey kimono-style dress.

Her partner Brad Pitt and Mr Hague’s wife Ffion, who usually shuns publicity, were also present.

Later he said he and US Secretary of State John Kerry, who also attended the summit, had ‘obviously’ discussed the deepening conflict in Iraq.

Downing Street defended Mr Hague’s decision to devote a week to accompanying Miss Jolie.

Mr Cameron believed it was the ‘right thing to do’ to carry on with the ‘very important initiative’, said a spokesman, who insisted Mr Hague had not taken his eye off the ball on Iraq.

In 1995, Angelina married Hackers 
co-star Jonny Lee Miller.

She wore black leather pants and a white top 
with Jonny's name reportedly scribbled in her own blood to the ceremony.

During the split from Miller, she had her first openly gay relationship. She 
began dating her 'Foxfire' co-star Jenny Shimizu, in 1998.

The following year, Jolie married 
Academy Award-winning actor Billy Bob Thornton.

In 2001, Angelina Jolie 
and Billy Bob Thornton reportedly signed their wills in blood.

Throughout their relationship, they wore vials of each other's blood on a matching necklace.

That same year, Angelina caused a 
stir when she and her producer brother James Haven shared a passionate 
kiss at the Oscars after she won the award for Girl, Interrupted.

She has fourteen known tattoos, 
including one with the Latin proverb 'quod me nutrit me destruit' - which means 'what
 nourishes me destroys me'.

She also has the Tennessee Williams 
quote: 'A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages', as well as a 
twelve-inch-by-eight-inch tiger.

She also has seven sets of geographical 
coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her children and her partner 
Brad Pitt.

She has covered or removed several of
 her tattoos, including the name of her second husband Billy Bob, and 
the Chinese characters for death and courage.

On growing up: 'When other little girls wanted to be ballet dancers, I wanted to be a vampire.'

On other people's opinions of her: 'If I make a fool of myself, who cares? I'm not frightened by anyone's perception of me.'

On depression: 'Therapy? I don't need that. The roles that I choose are my therapy.'

On death: 'Because I am a bad girl, people automatically think that I am a 
bad girl. Or that I carry a dark secret with me or I'm obsessed 
with death. The truth is that I am probably the least morbid person one 
can meet. If I think more about death than some other people, it is 
probably because I love life more than they do.'

On settling down: 'I never felt settled or calm. You can't really commit to life when you feel that.'

On her sexuality: 'Honestly, I like everything, boyish girls, girlish boys, the heavy and the skinny.'

On adoption: 'I'm drawn to kids that are already 
born. I think some people are meant to do certain things and I believe 
I'm meant to find my children in the world somewhere and not necessarily
 have them genetically.'

On the blood virals necklaces: 'It was never a vial anyway. It 
was like a flower press. It was like from a slight cut on your finger 
and you press your fingerprint in. It was kind of a sweet gesture.'

On her sanity: 'There's certainly a 
side of me that isn't completely... sane. Or completely 'even' all the 
time. We all have our dark sides.'
