It may be 140 million miles from Earth, but it appears Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover is still subject to taking part in the same fads as those it left behind on its home planet.

Nasa has released a new 'selfie' sent back by the robotic planetary explorer as it trundles over a rocky outcrop on the surface of the red planet.

Captured from the end of the rover's robotic arm, the scene was stitched together by combining dozens of pictures taken by a camera designed for analysing rocks.

This selfie of Nasa's Curiosity rover above was stitched together from dozens of images to crop out the robotic arm used to take the image

The resulting image reveals Curiosity in high definition surrounded by the bleak and desert like landscape in the Pahrump Hills within the enormous Gale crater on Mars.

Microsoft’s ‘HoloLens' headset, which allows wearers to see 3D images superimposed over their vision, may look like it belongs in a sci-fi film.

And now Nasa has revealed the prototype technology will be used to enable its scientists to work virtually on Mars.

The headset will work with OnSight software to give scientists a means to plan experiments on the red planet, with the help of the Curiosity rover.

The software was developed jointly by the two companies, including a team at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.  

The site is close to the base of Mount Sharp, or Aeolis Mons as it is also known, a 18,000 feet peak that rises from the centre of the Gale crater.

To the left of the rover, two small holes in the rock - each about 0.63 inches across - created by Curiosity's sample collecting drill can be seen.

One of the holes, which are known as the Mojave sample site, still has the grey rock powder around it that was collected by the rover.

Curiosity has been taking regular samples with its drill from the slopes of Mount Sharp as scientists attempt to learn more about the history of the planet.

A tyre tread left by Curiosity's 16 inch wide wheels can also be seen slightly higher up from the holes in the image.

The robotic arm holding the Mars Hand Lens Imager, which captured the selfie, has been cropped out of the image by piecing together a mosaic of shots.

Using wrist actions and turret rotations, the arm was able to produce a variety of angles to capture the image.

It was actually taken over the course of three days, with the rover itself being photographed on 14 January 2015 and much of the background was captured on 29 January 2015. Frames showing the drill holes were taken on 31 January 2015.

Like all good selfies, Curiosity is looking straight into the camera with the array of seventeen cameras in its 'head' that help it navigate.

Behind the rover the peak of Mount Sharp can be seen on the horizon on the left, while the rim of the Gale crater stretches out to the right.

This labelled image of Nasa's Curiosity's selfie shows the 18,000 feet tall Mount Sharp in the distance and the rim of the Gale Crater along with the drill sites (marked in yellow) where the rover has taken rock powder samples and some other distinctive landmarks identified by scientists

The image is so detailed it is possible to see the test hole and sample hole drilled by Curiosity at the Mojave site (left) and a tyre track (right)

Directly below the rover on the right of the picture area a series of sites where further drill samples have been taken since this image was taken.

Most recently Curiosity took samples at the distant Telegraph peak, which can be seen just over the rovers left shoulder.

It is not the first selfie to be sent back from Mars by Curiosity - it has sent one back every year since arriving on Mars.

Curiosity has sent back three previous selfies since arriving on the red planet, with the first taken after 84 days on the surface (left), the second taken in February 2013 reveals rock samples the rover had explored (middle) and the third taken in April 2014 next to sandstone rocks (right)

The first taken on October 31 2012 after 84 days on the surface was composed of 55 separate images taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager.

Such pictures allow Nasa's engineers and scientsts to check on the health of the rover and see whether it is being effected by the thick red dust on the Martian surface.

It also allows them to see the surrounding landscape to check for any nearby hazards that may pose a threat to the rover.

Dr John Bridges, a reader in planetary science at Leicester University, said Curiosity was now in the Pahrump area of the crater. 

He said: 'The rock pavement is made of fine grained sediment, including from an ancient lake. Pahrump has told us that the lower part of Mt Sharp is composed largely of lake deposits. 

'So this is really moving on our understanding of Mars and its ancient climate and habitability for microbial life. Say 10 years ago, we really had no firm evidence for lake deposits.'

Curiosity used its robotic arm to take dozens of images that were then stitched together to produce the final selfie

Tiny drill holes left by the rover after it took rock samples can be clearly seen off to one side of the robotic explorer

A tyre track left by Curiosity's 16 inch wide wheels can also be seen imprinted in a patch of Mars' rust coloured soil

Curiosity has sent back three previous self portrait pictures - one each year since it landed on the red planet in 2012
