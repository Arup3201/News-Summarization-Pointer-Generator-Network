At some point, Osman Sow’s spot-kick will re-enter Earth’s atmosphere, scattering debris in its wake. When it returns to terra firma Hearts will still be reflecting on the chances they blew to send Celtic into a tailspin.

It was comfortable for the league champions in the end. On-loan John Guidetti’s first goal for the club brought an early birthday present for his watching father Mike. But the outcome of this game undoubtedly hinged on two penalties early in the second half.

Sow, the gangling Hearts matchwinner against Rangers on the opening day of the Championship season, struck a dubious award high into the heavens in the 54th minute.

It was a real head in hands moment for Sow as he wasted the chance to drag Hearts level 

And moments later Kris Commons showed Osman Sow how it's done from 12 yards 

Within 60 seconds another Willie Collum award at the other end was thumped past Neil Alexander by Kris Commons. The contrast between the execution of the penalties was stark. For Hearts the game was up.

Asked if there was a lack of conviction to Sow’s lofted, awful attempt Robbie Neilson took solace in black humour.

'I think there is a lot of conviction in it. It’s still coming down.

'He has gone up there and smashed it and I would rather someone went up there with a bit of conviction than flaff it or try to chip it.

'At least Osman has had the strength to go up and take it but that’s the small margins in football.

'The boys rallied round him at the end. He is a big character and we move on. You miss some, you score some.

'At 1-0 down you score that and it’s a different game. You miss it, Celtic go up the park and score.'

The penalty was hardly an isolated chance. Jamie Walker struck the crossbar with a great chance at the end of the first half. Adam Eckersley’s own goal handed Celtic a cheap third goal and merely confirmed the feeling that Hearts were architects of their own downfall once again against Celtic.

There were plenty pre-match who fancied the Edinburgh side. The Championship leaders were available at a generous 11/1 at one bookmaker. Against an unconvincing Celtic side of late that looked a very decent bet.

Yet Guidetti, on loan from Manchester City, had a motivation of his own driving him on. The striker’s father celebrates his birthday today and after opening his account last night the player said: 'I have good people around me, not only my father but many people that are good.

Aleksander Tonev (27) thought he had also scored his first Celtic goal - but it's chalked off for offside 

“Since it’s his birthday he is my dad that was a birthday present for him.

'He was here tonight as always and I am trying to get him tickets for Paolo Nutini – he is a big fan.

'I heard Paolo was a Celtic fan but he is sold out and I am not getting a follow back on Twitter. I am disappointed.

'Maybe after the goal tonight we can sort it out. This is what I want to give dad for his birthday.'

The Swede blew a golden chance for his first goal in Celtic colours when Alim Ozturk’s efforts to usher a Callum McGregor through ball back to Alexander was poor, allowing Guidetti to nip in and slot wide.

Kris Commons and Scott Brown – with a thumping half volley from 18 yards – forced Alexander into further resistence before Guidetti justified the decision to hand him the number nine shirt.

Emilio Izaguirre had one of his best nights in some time here, unfortunate to lose the man of the match award to Scott Brown. The Honduran foisted a series of inviting crosses into the area and his first, a piercing, curling effort, was headed unconvincingly up in the air by Danny Wilson - dropping invitingly for Guidetti to thump the ball into the net.

Yet Hearts weren’t dead. Not by a long way.

Izaguirre’s attacking heroics are often cancelled out by a defensive rush of blood and so it proved before half-time when his slack, aimless pass across his own 18 yard line deceived his team-mates and sent Jamie Walker in on goal.

It was a glorious chance. One the winger almost tried too hard with, his thumping over-hit shot rattling off the face of the crossbar when he only had to guide the ball past Craig Gordon.

With the booked Jason Denayer taken off before he was sent off after an early booking, Hearts sensed a renewed vulnerability in their hosts and earned their reward for a strong start to the second half with the Sow spot-kick.

It was a distinctly soft award, the Swede caught by Virgil van Dijk in the area as he sought to control the ball.

But everything about Sow’s spot kick was wrong. His run-up, his shooting action, the lax leaning back finish which flew over the crossbar, soaring towards Celtic’s Park’s deserted top tier.

Emboldened Celtic made Hearts pay for their wastefulness.

Racing onto an Efe Ambrose long ball Guidetti was clattered wildly by the upper arm of Ozturk.

The central defender was booked, but the greater punishment came from the boot of Commons, last season’s top scorer rasping his spot kick low into the net for 2-0.

From Walker’s shot against the crossbar to Sow’s penalty atrocity, Hearts had cause to wonder how it had come to this. They had blown it.

Their wounds became gaping in 62 minutes when left-back Eckersley scored a mildly farcical own goal.

The former Manchester United and Aarhus defender made the bold decision to turn an Anthony Stokes corner back to Alexander with his chest, but succeeded only in guiding it into the bottom corner of his own net for 3-0.

For Celtic a first clean sheet in nine games made this an unexpectedly comfortable night.

'I was happy that Guidetti got his first goal,' said Deila afterwards. 'He has been out for a long time and not played that many matches and that’s why we don’ t use him for 90 minutes.

'He made a huge impact tonight and that was good.

'We gave away some chances but they were down to individual mistakes and they are things that we can work on. We had plenty of opportunities to score and I felt we were well worth our win.'
