Analogue radio has been given a stay of execution after ministers admitted too few listeners were switching to digital.

Both FM and AM radio were due to be turned off in 2015, though the Government had already considered a delay as digital uptake was so slow.

But now ministers have decided to postpone the plan indefinitely after discovering that barely a third of radio is received from digital stations.

Delays: Ministers will not set a date to switch of FM services until more people start using digital radios

Communications minister Ed Vaizey said more needed to be done to persuade listeners to switch. 

Mr
Vaizey said: ‘I regard my role as a supporter and enabler of digital 
radio but . . . I completely respect the people’s passion for radio and 
not being made to do something they don’t want to do.

‘I also have a 
huge amount of respect for people who run independent commercial 
stations. They’re not flying off to the Caribbean for Christmas; these 
are tough organisations to run and they don’t make a huge amount of 
money.’

Ministers have refused to set a deadline until half of all radio listened to is on digital settings.Mr Vaizey added: ‘We are not there yet. So now is not the time to switch over.’

Mr Vaizey added a new ‘digital 
certification mark’ scheme is planned for 2014, which aims to identify 
radios that meet the industry's minimum technical and performance 
standards.

In a written 
ministerial statement, he said: ‘In spite of recent progress, the 
current rate of digital listening has not yet reached 40 per cent. We 
have always been clear that the switch to digital must be consumer-led 
rather than Government imposed.

‘Therefore,
we do not believe that now is the time to commit to a switchover. 
Nonetheless, we want to maintain the positive industry action to promote
digital listening, because we know that consumers like the clearer 
sound and ease of tuning, not to mention the wide range of content 
offered.’

Communications minister Ed Vaizey said more people had to go digital before he would set a date for switchover

Digital listening includes DAB 
radio and the internet and when switchover happens it will see all 
existing FM coverage has been replicated on DAB networks. Digital switchover of television completed last year.

Just
one in 20 people have a digital radio in their cars and only 40 per 
cent of new vehicles come equipped with them. Converting an existing car
radio to a digital one would cost around £100.

Less than half of households own digital radios, which start from around £30 but can cost more than £150. 

There
are more than 100million analogue sets across Britain, which would 
become obsolete if the FM and AM frequencies were switched off. Patchy 
coverage has also blighted the transmission of digital radio.

Labour’s
culture spokesman, Helen Goodman, told the BBC that people did not have
money for the switch, saying: ‘In the middle of a cost-of-living 
crisis, this is not what people need.’

She added that digital take up should be closer to 75 per cent before a deadline was set.

Digital radio groups are pushing for ministers to agree a date for a switch.

Bauer Media and Global Radio have called for non-digital radio to be switched off in 2018, as has industry body the Radio Centre.

However small, independent radio stations have warned they do not have the money or staff to make the switch in a hurry.

A
coalition of 81 national, regional and local commercial radio stations 
was established last month to campaign against an enforced switchover.

Paul
Smith CBE, chairman of Celador Entertainment, which is part of the 
coalition, said: ‘The Government’s decision not to commit to switch over
is very good news for listeners.

‘We have always felt that 
broadcasters are best placed to understand the needs of their audiences 
and that platform investment decisions should rest with individual radio
stations.’ 

To help stations switch, Mr Vaizey said the Government, 
the BBC and the commercial sector would pump £21million into upgrading 
digital transmitters.

This would improve national BBC digital coverage from 94 per cent to 97 per cent.

Just one in 20 people have a digital radio in their cars and only 40 per cent of new vehicles come equipped with them

Local transmitters, which cover both BBC and commercial stations, would increase their coverage from 70 per cent to 90 per cent.

New national commercial radio stations
could launch as Ofcom seeks interest to build and run a second national
commercial multiplex in the new year, according to Mr Vaizey.

Motorists
are also in line to receive better information on how to upgrade their 
car radio to digital and details of approved installers.

Government
figures show 41.6 per cent of new cars sold in October had DAB radios 
fitted as standard, an increase from 4.4% in 2010.

Paul
Keenan, chief executive of Bauer, said: ‘The continued growth of DAB 
means listeners will benefit from an increased choice of stations, a 
better radio listening experience and a certainty that they can tune in 
24/7 to the best radio content on offer worldwide.’ 

Although Britain is a leading manufacturer of digital radio sets, it lags behind Europe in switching over.

Norway and Denmark have already made pledges to switch off their analogue signal.

Germany and France are also making moves to set deadlines.Radio
listeners will not be forced to go digital for several years after 
ministers warned too many people are still using analogue devices.
