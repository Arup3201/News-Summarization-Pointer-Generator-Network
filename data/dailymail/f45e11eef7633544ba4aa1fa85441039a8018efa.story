A chilling letter written by serial killer Dennis Nilsen in which he coolly analyses the murders he committed and brands himself a ‘creative psychopath’ was revealed today.

Nilsen explains his ‘overwhelming desire to kill’ in the never-seen-before document, written shortly after his arrest in 1983 for killing and dismembering a string of young men at two homes in London.

He tells in the unpublished letter how he longed to be caught for his crimes - which involved luring men to his home, strangling them, dissecting their dead bodies and then disposing of the parts.

And he claims he got a kick out of reviving some of his victims instead of killing them. The letter was written on March 24, 1983, six weeks after his arrest while he was awaiting trial in HMP Brixton.

Its existence was unknown until a collector listed it for sale with Fraser Autographs in central London.

Little is known about how the letter entered private hands, but it has been verified by experts and is now expected to fetch £1,000 when it goes under the hammer this Thursday.

In the letter, titled Mental Condition Notes, Nilsen claims he did not know why he was compelled to kill his 15 victims and attempt to murder a further eight over a five-year period.

He said: ‘I have felt that since my 
teenage days that I am a creative psychopath. Since I have committed 15 
killings and 8 attempted killings I feel able to go further on this self
 assessment.

‘In times of 
acute emotional pressure and under the triggering influence of spirits 
i.e. alcohol, usually dormant mental forces have been released which 
have made mine the actions of a destructive psychopath.’

Nilsen, a civil servant, carried out the vile killings at 195 Melrose Avenue and 23 Cranley Gardens in the Muswell Hill area of north-west London between 1978 and 1983.

His victims were all young men between the ages of 14 and 30. After killing them, he would ritually wash their bodies before dissecting them.

He wrote: ‘The greater the beauty (in 
my estimation) of the man, the greater was the sense of loss and grief. 
Their dead naked bodies fascinated me but I would have done anything to 
have them back alive.

‘At 
least three of the attempts I managed to revive and felt like I had 
actually saved their lives. These successes brought great happiness to 
me. I couldn’t understand why I had apparently tried to kill them in the
 first place.’

He also claimed that he felt remorse for killing his last victim, 20-year-old Steven Sinclair.

He
 said: ‘I still have a warm affection for him and would have wanted to 
help him with his drug problem, look after him and sleep with him.

‘I would have liked to have a long and close social and sexual (normal sexual) relationship with him. I did not like to see him suffer.

‘After his death I washed him and when I laid him naked on the bed there was a conciliatory comfort in seeing him at peace.’

Nilsen pleaded not guilty to the killings but was found guilty after a two-week trial at the Old Bailey. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years, but it was upgraded to a full life tariff in 1994.

Now 68, he is serving out his sentence at Full Sutton in East Yorkshire, the jail where ‘Britain's most notorious prisoner’ Charles Bronson is also held.

Dr Philip Best, an expert at Fraser Autographs, said: ‘This extraordinary document gives a fascinating insight into one of the more intriguing British criminals of the last 50 years.

'His self analysis is ruthless and he has a forensic coolness in his description of his crimes'

Dr Philip Best, Fraser Autographs

‘Nilsen wrote it days after his arrest and even at this early stage it shows him seeking to understand and explain how he came to be one of Britain’s most notorious serial killers.

‘He is approaching what he had done and trying to understand it with a degree of self examination that is not common among criminals of his kind.

‘His self analysis is ruthless and he has a forensic coolness in his description of his crimes. Nilsen’s very measured approach to his crimes is shocking because how could one take such an approach to such atrocities?

‘In this letter we see Nilsen setting out the template for the position he has kept for the last 25 years. Nilsen was remarkably open to trying to understand his own psychopathy.

‘Even though he expresses remorse it is questionable how deep that remorse goes. The letter has come to light after a member of the auction trade was offered it and brought it to us.

‘Its history before that is murky but it is 100 per cent genuine. It is unmistakably Nilsen’s writing and the tone of the letter is in keeping with his style.

‘It’s pure, classic Nilsen and has never been published before. I think this will appeal to a collector with an intellectual interest in Nilsen.’
