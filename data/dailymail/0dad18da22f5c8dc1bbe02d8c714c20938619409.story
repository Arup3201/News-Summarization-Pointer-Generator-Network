A man whose life was traumatized from a Hamas attack aided by Iran, is taking legal action against a posh U.S. hotel that plans to house Iran's president.

Stuart Hersh -- who was injured and has suffered from emotional issues after a 1997 bombing in Israel -- has filed legal papers to stop The Warwick hotel in Midtown Manhattan for accepting a reservation from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, when the dictator hits the Big Apple for the United Nations General Assembly that begins in late September.

Hersh has a $12 million judgement against Iran, as he joined eight other bombing survivors in filing a 2000 lawsuit against the rogue nation, seeking punitive damages for their injuries in the attack.

Coming to the USA: Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (speaking at the UN in 2011) will return to New York in 2012 for the annual United Nations General Assembly

Welcome: The swanky NYC hotel where Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his delegation will stay is expected to cost a cool $20,000 a night for the group

Ahmadinejad and his Iranian 
entourage have booked the 18th floor of the swanky hotel on 54th Street
and Sixth Avenue, for late September when he travels to the U.S. to 
address the UN, according to the New York Post.

The
leader, who has denied the Holocaust and said Israel 
should be 'wiped off the map,' will address the body on September 26 -- 
which is Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement.

Lawyers
for Hersh expect Iran will shell out close to $20,000 per night to 
house the Iranian delegation and they claim Hersh has a right to the money, 
given his successful lawsuit against the Middle Eastern nation for their role in the attack.

Hersh was at the Ben Yehuda 
Street pedestrian mall in downtown Jerusalem on the afternoon of 
September 4, 1997, when three Hamas suicide bombers with 'cases of 
powerful explosive bombs blew themselves up,' according to a federal lawsuit.

Stuart Hersh is entitled to $12 million in damages for injuries after the 1997 bombing

The bombs were packed with nails, screws, pieces of glass, and chemical poisons - killing five and injuring 200.

According to the lawsuit, it is estimated that Iran budgets 'between $50 million and $100 million a year sponsoring various organizations such as Hamas.'

Hersh, who at the time was an American citizen, says the attack turned his life upside down.

He suffered shrapnel wounds and burns and the trauma of the event led him to attempt suicide one year after the bombing.

Police intervened when Hersh sat in his room alone with a loaded handgun, ready to take his own life. 

Additionally, Hersh has suffered from 
post-traumatic stress disorder and his 'nightmares and other problems 
arising from his PTSD had become overwhelming,' his social worker 
Gershom Goldman said in the court filing.

He also lost 60 per cent hearing loss, experiences tinnitus, back pain, chronic ear infections, bum scars, 
difficulty walking, has permanent psycho motor retardation and a speech 
impediment.

The former journalist and police officer now lives in Hebron, in southern Israel, and says he is unable to work.

Hersh, now 64, is entitled to recover compensatory damages 
for his past and future pain and suffering in the amount of $12,000,000.

Ahmadinejad's ability to enter the U.S. so easily has been widely protested but Hersh is seeking legal barriers to his inhibit the leader's ability to enjoy a week-long stay in the city.

'If this war criminal Ahmadinejad needs a place to sleep, maybe the murderers over in the Libyan embassy can put him up for a night,' one of Hersh's lawyers, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner of the Shurat HaDin/Israel Law Center, told the New York paper. 

And Hersh agrees.

One of Hersh's lawyers, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, thinks the dictator should seek shelter with 'murderers over in the Libyan embassy

'Ahmadinejad is going to be staying at The Warwick hotel, paying a 
fortune, and he owes me $12 million and he just won't pay it,' Hersh 
told the Post via phone from Israel, where he lives in Kiryat 
Arba. 

'He throws that in my face and in the face of America, saying: '"Hey, I still got money - despite your sanctions."'

Ahmadinejad's highly controversial presence at the world gathering is garnering criticism and protestors have decried The Warwick's decision to host the leader. He had also stayed at the hotel for the UN conference in 2011.

'Apparently the folks at the Warwick Hotel believe that the returns from hosting a would-be genocidal dictator are worth more than the negative publicity such an act brings,' an editorial in The Jewish Voice read.

'That any self-respecting business owners would roll out the red carpet for the mamzer is just baffling,' it added.

A spokesman for the hotel did not comment to the Post on Hersh’s legal action.

Additionally, Ahmadinejad's scheduled speech on the Jewish holy day is considered a slap in the face.

'Any country that sits in during 
Ahmadinejad's speech is in violation of the United Nations Charter,' 
which forbids member states from threatening other member states, 
Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ron Prosor told 
the Times of Israel.

Prosor also charged the Iranian regime with inventing 'new terms in the English language for liquidation, eradication and erasing of Israel and Jews from the pages of history. One cannot be quiet in the face of these anti-Semitic rants, yet we don’t hear any outcry from the international community,' he said.
