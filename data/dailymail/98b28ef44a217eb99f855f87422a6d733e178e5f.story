The New York 
apartment where Philip Seymour Hoffman tragically died of a drug 
overdose in February is back on the market and the rent has increased 
since the Oscar winner lived there.

The condo, which is located in a building called Pickwick House in the 
West Village, is available to rent of $10,500 a month, reports the New York Post.

Hoffman had only moved into the address last October, when he rented it for $9,995 a month.

which enable it to get flooded with natural light.

It
 also features 10-foot-high, wood-beamed ceilings, a wood-burning brick 
fireplace, strip oak floors and custom closets in both bedrooms.

The
 building, which was besieged by people paying their respects following
 the actor's untimely death, is a former printing plant that was built in 
1880 and then converted into apartments in 1984. It is part of the Historic Preservation District.

Mail Online has reached out to listing agent Arlyne Blitz of the Corcoran Group for comment.

Earlier this week the jazz 
musician arrested on heroin possession charges amid an investigation 
into Hoffman's death lost his bid to have the case handled by a New York
 drug court that emphasizes treatment instead of punishment.

A Manhattan judge turned down Robert Vineberg's request on Wednesday. The case will continue in a regular criminal court.

Vineberg
 was arrested as police followed leads after Hoffman's death from a 
combination of heroin, cocaine and other drugs. Vineberg isn't charged 
with any role in the Capote actor's death.

Vineberg has said he and Hoffman were friends but hadn't been in touch since December.

Vineberg
 has pleaded not guilty to possessing 300 packets of heroin with the 
intent to sell it. His lawyer has called him an addict.

The Oscar-winning actor, 46, was 
found dead on February 2 in his West Village apartment 
surrounded by 70 bags of heroin and 20 used syringes.

Hoffman's
 tragic death came less than a year after he completed a stint in rehab 
for his addiction after being clean for 23 years.

According to the New York medical examiner, acute mixed drug intoxication was the cause of death.

One
 of the drugs found in Hoffman's system was benzodiazepine - a 
psychoactive drug with sedative and muscle relaxant properties that can 
be used to treat anxiety disorders. 

The other prescription drug found in Hoffman's system amphetamine was an 'upper' - such as  Adderall - and can be used to give an enhanced feeling of wakefulness and focus.

Longtime partners: Philip Seymour Hoffman and Mimi O'Donnell, pictured in an undated photo, had been together for many years. They had separated shortly before his death as Hoffman tried to beat his drug addiction

Mixing the heroin and cocaine together
 is known as 'speed-balling' and is the same deadly combination that 
claimed the lives of actors River Phoenix, John Belushi and Chris 
Farley. 

The star 
reportedly fell off the wagon during the wrap party for his 2012 movie 
The Master and entered rehab in May of last year.

The Capote star
 was found at dead at his home early on the morning of February 2 by his friend 
David Bar Katz when he didn't show to pick up his children.

Investigators
 have determined that Hoffman made six ATM transactions for a total of 
$1,200 inside a supermarket near his home on the Saturday night before his death.

Before his death, Hoffman separated from costume designer 
Marianne 'Mimi' O’Donnell, the mother of his three children, as he battled addiction. 

Hoffman moved into an apartment close to where Ms O'Donnell lives with the children in their $4.2 million apartment.

The actor leaves Ms O'Donnell and their three children - son Cooper, 10, Tallulah, seven, and five-year-old Willa.

The
 actor, who won an Oscar for Capote and also starred in The Hunger 
Games, The Master and Moneyball, was considered one of the leading 
talents of his generation.

He
 was remembered at a funeral on February 6 for 400 people at the Church 
of St. Ignatius Loyola on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

The service at attended by his 
family and close friends in Hollywood including Cate Blanchett, Meryl 
Streep, Ethan Hawke, Amy Adams and Joaquin Phoenix.
