A college party that went well into the morning did not end well for some students at California Polytechnic State University.

Roughly 30 students who had danced and drank the night away were on the roof of a garage when it collapsed underneath them around 6:20am Saturday morning during a St. Fratty's Day party.

Of those, ninw were injured, with eight of the injuries being minor and one serious.

In the serious injury, a person's thigh was impaled by a piece of debris early Saturday, the city said in a statement.

A roof collapsed early Saturday morning as 30 college students were partying and dancing at a St. Fratty's Day party

The 1,000 people at the party were mostly students at California Polytechnic State University

Eight others were treated for cuts and bruises. None of the injuries are life-threatening. 

The off-campus party, which was not affiliated in any way with the college, drew about 1,000 students, and hundreds could still be seen partying in a video that showed the exact moment the roof collapsed.

'We are working closely with fire and hospital officials to stay apprised of the conditions of those who were hurt,' Cal Poly spokesperson Matt Lazier said in a statement to Mustang News.

'Our thoughts are with those injured, and we wish them a speedy recovery. Cal Poly is also in close contact with local public safety agencies as they work to determine exactly what occurred. Their findings will help inform our own efforts to ascertain what led to this incident and decide how we will respond.'

Nine people were injured, with eight of the injuries being minor and one serious 

The university is working with authorities to learn if any college-affiliated organizations were involved in hosting the event

Police Capt. Chris Staley says three people were arrested for misdemeanors as his department and the San Luis Obispo Fire Department brought the scene under control a few hours after the collapse. 

Staley said the event, and its coming 10 days before St. Patrick's Day, caught police by surprise.

'This is completely unprecedented,' Staley told the San Luis Obispo Tribune.

'We've never had anything like this.' 

Lazier meanwhile said the university is working with authorities to learn if any college-affiliated organizations were involved in hosting the event.
