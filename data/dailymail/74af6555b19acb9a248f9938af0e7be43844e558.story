It was a badge of honour sold by was hero Sapper James Angel to feed his family.

But now a long-lost gallantry medal has been rightfully returned to his relatives - who had no idea it existed until his great-granddaughter's school project triggered the investigation.

Elizabeth Turner, nine, asked her grandmother Sheila Scott for help with her homework on World War Two and was told about a late relative who fought in Europe.

With great risk to his own life, Sapper Angel drew enemy fire away from his comrades by engaging them with his Bren gun

It prompted Mrs Scott and husband Nigel 
to carry out some research on the internet about Mr Angel, a modest man 
who rarely spoke about his experiences of war.

Such was his humble attitude, he failed to tell anyone that he had won the Military Medal for his incredibly heroic action.

Sapper Angel put himself in the line of fire when Allied soldiers were pinned down by Germans as they tried to cross the Rhine in Germany in March 1945.

With great risk to his own life, he 
drew enemy fire away from his comrades by engaging them with his Bren 
gun and allowed the British to locate and silence the Germans.

It is believed that after the war Mr Angel sold his Military Medal to help provide for his seven children.

They not only uncovered her father's citation for the award published in the London Gazette in 1945 but they also managed to trace the whereabouts of the gong.

It was being offered for sale by an internet dealer in militaria. Mrs Scott immediately contacted them and arranged to buy the medal that was for sale for £1,900.

It has now been reunited with Mr Angel's other campaign medals the family still have.

Mrs Scott, 61, from Wimborne, Dorset, said: 'Elizabeth was doing a school project on the war and she came to us because she thought we might be able to help her.

'We told her about my father and her granddad began doing some searching online and we came across my father's recommendation in the London Gazette in 1945.

'My father was a very quiet man who provided for his family and never spoke about the war. The family knew he once had a special medal but didn't know anything else about it.

'I think he sold it to help feed us 
when we were all small. I was one of seven brothers and sisters and life
was pretty hard for us, so I understand.

'I
was quite shell-shocked when I found out what he did and then to 
actually find the medal still in existence was something else.

'My father could have had the initials MM after his name all his life but he never mentioned it.

'I felt that I owed it to my father to
buy it back. I have all his other medals and it is very special and 
quite emotional to have them all complete again.'

Mr
Angel enlisted with the Royal Engineers in 1940 at the age of 33 and 
was evacuated from Le Havre, France, in June that year when the Allies 
were being overrun by the Germans.

He was posted to the Bomb Disposal 
Company in Colchester, Essex, and returned to France after D-Day in No 
279 Field Company, Royal Engineers.

He saw action across France, Belgium and Holland as the Allies fought their way across the Rhine and into Germany.

On March 25, 1945 he was a Bren gunner in a reconnaissance car at a bridge on the River Issel in Wesel, Germany.

His recommendation for the Military Medal was signed in the field by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.

The Military Medal is the third highest award for gallantry and is only bettered by the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Victoria Cross

It stated: 'When the leading infantry came under fire, Sapper Angel engaged the enemy and drew their fire thus assisting the infantry to locate and silence them.

'Later when the infantry were hard pressed by counter-attacks, Sapper Angel moved out in his recce. car in full view of the enemy and by engaging them with his Bren gun forced them to go to ground.

'Throughout the action Sapper Angel displayed complete disregard for his own safety.'

Elizabeth is a year four pupil at Sandford St Martin's Primary School in Wareham.

Her mum Angela, 38 said: 'Elizabeth was talking to my mother about her father being in the war and that's what started the research for this special medal.

'Elizabeth has been able to take in the citation document and photographs into school to show other children.

'It has been useful and important for children to see things like Montgomery's signature and find out who he was.

'A really important piece of family history has been uncovered with the help of this project.'
