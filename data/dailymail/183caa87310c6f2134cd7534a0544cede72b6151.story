TV presenter Eamonn Holmes sparked outrage today after an on-air outburst where he dismissed a report claiming one in two children had bullied - and called his co-host a 'wimp'.

Sky News Sunrise host Holmes, 52, condemned an Ofsted report which claimed that almost one half of all pupils suffered some degree of bullying at school.

Reviewing the day’s national newspapers on the Sunrise show at 7am, father-of-four Eamonn slammed the findings as 'unbelievable'.

Bullying discussion: Eamonn Holmes and co-presenter Charlotte Hawkins fall out over the bullying statistics that show half of children have suffered

He went on to call school bullying 'just life' and 'growing up' and mocked it as just 'someone sticking their tongue out'.

Horrified co-presenter Charlotte Hawkins, 37, was clearly stunned by his remarks and told him: 'If someone feels bullied that means they are being bullied, surely?'.

But Eamonn, who previously presented GMTV for 13 years, then turned on Charlotte and replied: 'That’s why the world is in the state that it is, people like you just being wimpy about everything'.

Today furious anti-bullying campaigners and Twitter users slammed Eamonn as a 'bully' himself.

Lauren Seager Smith, of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, based at the National Children’s Bureau, said: 'Bullying is a serious issue that can have a devastating effect on the lives of children and young people.

'Children and young people who experience bullying need to know they can speak out, that they will be heard, and that they will be taken seriously.'

Claude Knight, director of Kidscape, 
said: 'It is so unfortunate that we should still be hearing comments 
such as, ‘Bullying is part of growing up’.

'To say to children and young people that it is somehow OK for them to be subjected to bullying is totally unacceptable.

'We must remember that there are long-term effects for the targets, and indeed for the bullies.

'If we feed young people the myth 
overtly, or by messages of acceptance, that bullying is "normal 
behaviour" then we are failing them.

Defiant: Eamonn Holmes later took to Twitter to back his points about bullying and argue with a parent who claimed his child had been a target of bullies

'It is possible to create 
environments in which bullying is defined appropriately and not 
tolerated, and in which aggression and violence are viewed as wholly 
inappropriate types of behaviour.

'We work with a large number of 
bullied children and their families each year, and it has to be said 
that they will feel very distressed that their suffering and despair has
 been dismissed so glibly.'

Eamonn, married to Ruth Langsford, was commenting on the front page of the ‘i’ newspaper, which carried the shock Ofsted figures.

The report, ‘No place for bullying’ stated that almost half of pupils surveyed at primary and secondary school felt picked on or bullied at some point.

Incidents related to friendships, appearance, their family situation, sexuality, race, religion, ability, being seen as clever, disability or a combination of factors.

One secondary school pupil told the questionnaire she had been bullied 'basically for being me'.

Eamonn said: 'The i leads on figures from an Ofsted report: almost half of children are bullied at school, now that I find just unbelievable. One out of two children.

'What do they constitute as bullying? Someone sticking their tongue out at them? There’s bullying, let’s take that very seriously but to say that one out of two children is put upon at school.

'Maybe that’s just life, maybe that’s what it’s called.'

Co-presenter Charlotte Hawkins replied: 'If someone feels bullied that means they are being bullied, surely?

Strong views: Charlotte Hawkins disagreed with her co-presenter, saying if a child felt bullied it was a case of bullying

'If half the children feel they are being bullied whatever form that takes because for some people it might have to be quite severe for it to have an impact but for other people even taunts can make them feel like they are being bullied and that should count in my opinion.'

Eamonn retorted: 'Don’t bully me. See, that’s why the world is in the state that it is, people like you just being wimpy about everything.'

Charlotte said: 'You can’t blame me for bullying you one minute and then call me wimpy the next.'

Eamonn summed up the piece by stating: 'One in two children are bullied at school. Don’t believe it, it’s called growing up basically.'

Eamonn Holmes was condemned as 'uninformed and crass' by campaigners and bullying victims.

On Twitter, Kevin Baxter said: 'Did 
@eamonnholmes just bully his coworker? And now, just says he dispelled 
the research? Errr that’s YOUR opinion @StopBullying'.

Eamonn wrote back: '@Mathmosman and 
your opinion is that every second child is being bullied ? Get a grip 
man , u r doing the fight against real buulying no favs (sic)'

Another user, Olivia Fielding 
tweeted: '@EamonnHolmes Scathing public attitudes like yours can stop 
children who really are being bullied from coming forward.'

Lively: The pair clashed during a paper review on Sky News this morning

Steve Coffey wrote to Charlotte 
Hawkins on the micro blogging site: '@SkyCharlotte Have asked Eamonn to 
meet with my daughter, so she can tell him all about being bullied, 
strangly he has now gone very quite (sic)!'

Later, Mr Coffey, 38, from 
Hampshire said his daughter was bullied so badly between the ages of nine and 12 that she was forced to move schools twice.

He said: 'I am very sad that a 
well-known personality such as Mr Holmes would say such a thing, his 
comments were uninformed and crass.

'I asked him to meet with my daughter so she could explain her thoughts on the subject.

'He refused, referred to me as a "deep thinker" and told me I could start a fight in an empty room.

'Really Sky News and its viewers deserve better.'

Mother Debbie Young, 47, was forced to move her daughter Samantha, eight, out of her school after she was tormented by school bullies.

Debbie, an assistant to Stroud MP Neil Carmichael, said she was 'disgusted' by Eamonn Holmes’ comments about bullying.

She said: 'It is awful, I can’t believe someone has actually said that. You would have thought he would have known better.

'For me, teasing is a fact of life but there is a whole difference between teasing and bullying and to say that is completely out of order.

'My view is that we will never stop bullying initially - it’s how you go about handling it that’s important.'

Tonight Eamonn Holmes said: 'I wouldn't ever condone bullying, I just questioned the stats - and I ask everyone else to do the same.

'As an interviewer my job is to question and challenge - it is important we differentiate between what is true damaging bullying and what is a bit of playground life, otherwise the smaller stuff stops the serious stuff being dealt with.

'Regular Sunrise viewers know Charlotte and I take opposing views on a subject most days - the idea is to stimulate debate which it clearly did.'
