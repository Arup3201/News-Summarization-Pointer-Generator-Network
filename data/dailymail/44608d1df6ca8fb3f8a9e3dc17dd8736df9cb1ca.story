England 
battled brilliantly against New Zealand in Dunedin on Saturday, but were
 brutally torn apart in 22 minutes as the All Blacks won 28-27.

Here,
 Sportsmail's World Cup winning coach Sir Clive Woodward rates the two 
teams and gives his verdict on which England players deserve to start 
next week's third and final Test.

England

Mike Brown - 7Helped drive England forward in the final 15 when it could have gone pear-shaped. Took try well

Manu Tuilagi - 6 Showed with last try what he could offer on wing but experiment over. An outside centre going forward.

Luther Burrell - 6The game didn’t flow his way and not a huge factor. Will he suffer in a possible midfield reshuffle?

Down and out? Luther Burrell is tackled by Richie McCaw and may be dropped for the third Test

Billy Twelvetrees - 6 Some good, and some not so good moments. Not to blame for turnover try by New Zealand

Marland Yarde - 7Still learning. Took his try very well and was busy throughout but needs to address his kicking game.

Owen Farrell - 6Yellow card was harsh but not playing as well as in the autumn. Unusually tentative in a few tackles.

Underwhelming: Owen Farrell kicks for goal and is stopped by Julian Savea (right)

Danny Care - 6 Made Yarde’s try superbly but first match for three weeks and kicking game looked rusty in first half.

Joe Marler - 6 Not as prominent around the park as usual, mainly because it was such hard going in the tight.

Rob Webber - 7 Another very fine game by the Bath man. Were England any better when Hartley came on? No.

David Wilson - 7 Much tougher in the tight but good to see the return of his handling and indeed kicking game!

Joe Launchbury - 7 Has been a Trojan for England but was much more tested this week against improved Kiwi front five.

Powerhouse: Joe Launchbury holds off a defender and passes in field

Geoff Parling - 7 Good lineout presence, hard working — Parling is making it difficult for Lancaster to drop him.

Tom Wood - 8 Hard working and competitive. After the game he insisted defeat was simply not good enough.

Chris Robshaw (capt) - 7 Found Richie McCaw back at his best last night so a much more challenging match altogether

Ben Morgan - 7 Strong in the tight going forward although exposed out wide defensively occasionally.

New Zealand

Ben Smith - 9Exceptional in attack and defence. Wonderful try-saving tackle on Tuilagi, brilliant try of his own.

Star man: New Zealand's Ben Smith was the best player on the pitch

Cory Jane - 7The occasional fumble, still not at his very best, but remains an accomplished all round player.

Conrad Smith - 8 Exceptionally gifted rugby player, world class in everything he does for New Zealand.

Ma’a Nonu - 8Roared back from a substandard performance last week. Took his try well, made another for Savea.

Julian Savea - 8 Probably the world’s best wing on current form. Constant threat in attack, strong in defence.

Wide boy: Julian Savea showed his class in attack and defence on Saturday

Aaron Cruden - 8 Clever game manager. Saves big plays for when they are needed — witness his break for Smith’s try.

Aaron Smith - 7 Quiet first half but electric when New Zealand started winning the collisions after half-time.

Tony Woodcock - 7 Very testing night at the office in Auckland, more comfortable at scrum-time in the ‘House of Pane’.

Dane Coles - 7Was probably playing for his place after last week but much stronger in the tight. Good lineout throwing.

Much improved: Dane Coles beats the tackle of Launchbury and Marler (right)

Owen Franks - 7Another under pressure after Eden Park who answered his critics with a powerful all-court performance.

Brodie Retallick - 7Developing a world class combination with Whitelock. Rock solid in the lineout, good in open spaces.

Sam Whitelock - 7 Never has a bad match. At the core of the pack. Particularly effective in these high-tempo games.

Liam Messam - 7 A quiet grafter in a team of stars. Provides the cement but always comfortable ball in hand.

Richie McCaw (capt) - 8 Recovered from missed tackle on Yarde that cost a try to start really hitting his straps in the second half.

Jerome Kaino - 7 Fiery and always formidable going forward, great hands and rugby nous to make a try for Savea.
