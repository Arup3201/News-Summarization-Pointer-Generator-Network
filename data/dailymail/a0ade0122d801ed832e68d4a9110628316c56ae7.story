Mystery: Despite two post mortem examinations, the cause of Lily Channon's death is still not known

A couple have been left heartbroken after their six-year-old daughter suddenly collapsed and died of a mystery illness.

Mark Channon and his partner Kelly Mullett assumed their only child Lily had caught a common cold when she came home from a party feeling unwell.

But just four days later her condition worsened and she was rushed to hospital where she later died.

Despite two post mortem examinations, the cause of Lily Channon’s death is still not known.

Mark, 50, and Kelly, 40, say not knowing has made coping with the tragedy much harder.

Speaking from their home in Gosport, Hampshire, Mark said: 'What caused Lily’s death is still a mystery. Not knowing makes everything so much worse.

'It has left a void in my heart that has broken me. I can’t understand why this has happened.'

Lily first showed signs of being unwell on Saturday, March 3, after coming home from a birthday party at a local play centre.

Mark and Kelly assumed she was suffering with a cold that had been passing around her friends and kept her home from school.

But on Wednesday, Lily’s temperature dropped dramatically and her pulse weakened.

Mark, a Ministry of Defence guard, said: 'We thought Lily had a cold. It didn’t seem like anything drastic, there was no cause for concern.

'But after four days she got worse. She said her chest and stomach hurt and she got very cold. She looked like the blood had drained from her.

'We tried to give her a bath to warm her up but she didn’t seem to be able to move properly and she seemed dazed.

'She was so drained of energy she fell asleep in the water.

'She woke up but when we got her out she was sick and became unresponsive. Her pulse was so weak I couldn’t feel it on her wrist.'

The paramedics were called and she was taken to nearby Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth where she put on a ventilator and given a saline drip.

Mark and Kelly hoped their daughter was improving but after several hours she stopped breathing and doctors fought to resuscitate her.

place in three months

Mark said: 'Kelly and I were sitting in the family room when a doctor rushed in to tell us Lily was extremely ill.

'To me it seemed like a dream, that it wasn’t real.

'We ran to her room and there must have been about 25 doctors and nurses working on her. They seemed to be trying everything.

'At one point her heart beat picked up again but then it went flat and it never came back.'

He added: 'Kelly and I are finding it very difficult to come to terms with what has happened.

'We have good and bad days and there are tears but we are trying to be strong for each other.'

Lily’s funeral is being held today at St Thomas the Apostle Church in Gosport.

Mark and Kelly hope they will finally find out the cause of their daughter’s death at her inquest, due to take place in three months.

Kelly added: 'It kills us not knowing how our happy, lively six-year-old could could be wiped out in four days after having what looked like a common cold.

'She has left a gaping hole in our lives. Our home is so quiet without her.'
