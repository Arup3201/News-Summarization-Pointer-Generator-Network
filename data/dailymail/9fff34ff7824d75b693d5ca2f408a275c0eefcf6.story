Some of the tallest and most recognisable skyscrapers across the world have been slammed as 'vain' for having a large amount of useless space.

For a skyscraper to be labelled with the prestigious supertall tag, it needs to be over 985ft in height, but the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has discovered many of these luxury buildings in places such as Dubai and China use unused space on top of their designs to bolster their height.

It has highlighted the ten 'vainest' skyscrapers, and discovered that in Dubai alone, 19 per cent of space at the top of the cities' skyscrapers is going unused.

For a skyscraper to be labelled supertall, it needs to be over 985ft. Some of the world's tallest buildings bolster their height by using unused space and the Council on Tall Building and Urban Habitat's (CTBUH) calls this Vanity Height. The top ten 'vainest' buildings are pictured with Dubai's Burj Al Arab topping the list

For a skyscraper to be labelled with the
 prestigious supertall tag, it needs to be over 985ft tall according to the Council on Tall Building and Urban Habitat's (CTBUH) Height Criteria.

Any space at the top of the building that can't be lived in or used for other purposes is classed as useless space.

This is classed as a building's Vanity Height because if it was removed, the skyscraper would no longer qualify as supertall.

By mid 2011 there were 54 buildings that were taller than CTBUH's 980ft cut off.

There are now 72 supertall building occupied worldwide.

CTBUH said that 61 percent of the world’s tallest
 buildings -  44 out of 72 - would not be classed as supertall if the 
unused space was removed.

The CTBUH said in the report: 'We noticed in Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, that a fair amount of the top of the building seemed to be an unoccupied spire.'

'This prompted us to investigate the increasing trend towards extreme spires and other extensions of tall buildings that do not enclose usable space, and create a new term to describe this - Vanity Height.'

The council - which officially determines the height of a building using its Height Criteria - go on to explain that Vanity Height is classed as the distance between a skyscraper’s highest living space, and what is considered its architectural top.

It lists the 10 worst offenders, with unused space ranging from 27 per cent up to 39 per cent, with five of them in Dubai.

The skyscraper with the greatest Vanity Height was found to be the iconic Burj Al Arab in Dubai.

It is architecturally 1,055 feet tall, yet the top 405 feet is 'useless' and without this unused space, the skyscraper wouldn't qualify as supertall.

The ratio of the living space in this luxury hotel, compared to the useless space, is 39 per cent.

The second vainest building is the Bank of America Tower in New York, which has 36 per cent unused space.

This equates to 429 feet of its 1,200 feet height, and again would lose its status if this top was removed.

The world's tallest building, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, also made the list with 29 per cent unused space, which consists of 800 feet of its 2,716 feet height.

Three of the top ten are in China, including the Zifeng Tower (30 per cent), the Minsheng Bank (28 per cent) and The Pinnacle (27 per cent).

CTBUH claim that the trend of these so-called vain skyscrapers was started by New York's Chrysler building, which was built in 1930.

CTBUH used charts to examine the rising trend for Vanity Height, pictured, in countries including China and Dubai. They claim the trend started with New York's Chrysler building in 1930. By mid-2011 there were 54 supertall buildings and there are now 72

However, it didn't become common place until China and the United Arab Emirates began building their supertall skyscrapers with spires and similar extensions.

By mid 2011 there were 54 buildings that were taller than CTBUH's 980ft cut off. There are now 72 supertall buildings occupied worldwide.

Elsewhere, the New York Times Tower and the Emirates Tower in Dubai have 31 per cent unused space.

None of the skyscrapers listed in CTBUH's top ten are outside of Dubai, China or New York.

According to CTBUH, 61 percent of the world’s tallest buildings -  44 out of 72 - would not be classed as supertall if the unused space was removed.

The CTBUH also claims that if a building's unused space is more than half its total height then it is technically classed as a 'non-building'.
