More than 1,400 intelligence staff at government listening post GCHQ joined together to form a giant poppy to mark this year's remembrance appeal.

Wearing red rain ponchos, the staff arranged themselves into the shape of the flower in the courtyard of the building in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, known as the 'doughnut'.

The formation created a poppy which measured 125 feet wide and 92 feet long with it taking volunteers over an hour to get into position.

More than 1,400 donned red ponchos and made their way to the courtyard of the GCHQ building to form the giant poppy 

The stunt was to launch this year's annual Poppy Appeal in aid of the Royal British Legion in the centenary year of the outbreak of the First World War 

It took staff at the government listening post over an hour to get into position to form the poppy 

Royal Navy staff wearing their black uniforms formed the centre of the flower while other military personnel dressed in green combat gear formed the poppy's stalk.

The stunt helped to launch Gloucestershire's local poppy appeal in aid of the Royal British Legion, in the centenary year of the beginning of the First World War.

A GCHQ spokesman said: 'Thanks to military planning and some loud hailers, it took just over an hour to get everyone into position.

The red rain ponchos worn by the staff made up the colour of the petals. They were later donated to charity and a local scouts group

'GCHQ has a long history of supporting the military, stretching back to 1914.

'Whenever and wherever British forces have deployed, GCHQ has been ready to assist, providing intelligence to help to keep UK troops safe.

'This enduring connection meant that there was no shortage of volunteers to help the Gloucestershire Legion with their efforts in the centenary year of World War One.'

The red rain ponchos used are to be donated to local scout groups and Bloodbikes, a charity which provides an out-of-hours emergency medical courier service to the local area.

A GCHQ spokesman said that there were no shortage of volunteers who wanted to take part in the poppy launch 

One participant, who made up part of a poppy petal, said: 'I was really proud to take part and show my support for the Royal British Legion by coming together with my colleagues, united in purpose, to honour those who have served and continue to serve this country.'

And Chris, a GCHQ civilian employee, said: 'I've worked with the military in Afghanistan and seen first-hand how GCHQ intelligence can help keep UK troops safe whilst on operation.

'I'm proud to see so many from GCHQ come together today to show their support for the Royal British Legion and the military family.'

GCHQ has a long history of supporting the military, dating back to 1914, when the First World War began 

The Royal British Legion said it was 'moving' to see so many people come together to support the work of the poppy appeal 

Nicole Mayall, from Gloucestershire's poppy appeal, said it was 'moving to see so many people standing together to support the work' of the Legion.

Yesterday the annual Poppy Appeal by the Royal British Legion was launched with a dawn-till-dusk vigil at the Cenotaph in central London. 

Soul singer Joss Stone was among the first to take part in 'The Watch' and was joined by members of the public and the British Armed Forces throughout the day until sunset. 

It was inspired by images of the repatriation of the Unknown Soldier in 1920, when guards kept a vigil at the coffin as a mark of respect.
