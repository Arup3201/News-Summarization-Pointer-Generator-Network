Leicestershire have announced the signing of Australian batsman Mark Cosgrove as club captain on a two-year contract.

The 30-year-old left-hander, who has a British passport, will be available in all competitions and links back up with South Australia and Sydney Thunder team-mate Andrew McDonald, who is the new Leicestershire head coach.

Cosgrove has played county cricket before, having spent three full seasons at Glamorgan, and represented Australia in three one-day internationals in 2006.

Leicestershire chief executive Wasim Khan said: 'We are delighted to sign a player of Mark's calibre, quality and experience.

'He will be a fantastic captain for us and we look forward to Mark having a huge influence on us in 2015.'

Batsman Ned Eckersley has been named as vice-captain for the 2015 season as Leicestershire continue to ring the changes following a forgettable few years which has seen them fail to win an LV= County Championship match since 2012.
