Three teenagers have drowned after getting into difficulties in rivers and a quarry during the heatwave.

The series of accidents at the start of the school holidays has led to warnings for children to stay away from dangerous locations.

Last night the body of a 14-year-old boy was recovered by police divers from a waterlogged quarry in Dudley, West Midlands.

The teenager, named locally as Augusto Zacarias, had gone missing earlier in the afternoon.

The tragedy follows the deaths of two boys on Tuesday in separate incidents.

Aaron Burgess, 14, died while cooling off in the River Avon near Bristol, while Daniel McCullagh, 15, died in the River Nene near Woodford in Northamptonshire.

Augusto is believed to have been sunbathing with friends at a site known locally as the ‘blue lagoon’, when he fell into the 20ft deep water.

Police found his body shortly before 8.30pm.

Friends had already set up an online tribute page while police dredged the pool for him.

One friend, Chloe Stone, wrote: ‘Such a shame, rest in peace sweetie, be sadly missed, always in our hearts.’

Earlier, the father of Aaron Burgess paid tribute to his ‘chip off the old block’.

Jay Burgess said his son was ‘always acting the fool’, adding that Aaron was ‘beautiful’.

Mr Burgess, of Longwell Green, near Bristol, was joined on the banks of the Avon by more than 50 of his son’s friends, who laid flowers and held a candlelit vigil.

Aaron had been sliding down a weir when he disappeared beneath the water at around 5.40pm.

Police divers recovered his body six hours later. Earlier on Tuesday, Daniel McCullagh had got into difficulties after jumping into the River Nene at around 3pm.

His friends tried to save him when his body slipped under the water, but he was swept away by the strong current.

Rescue crews found his body just over three hours later, almost half a mile away from where he disappeared.

Daniel’s father Gabriel last night described him as a ‘lovely, funny lad who just wanted to fit in and have loads of friends’.

He put a message on Facebook thanking people for their kind words and saying that he and Daniel’s mother were ‘heartbroken’.

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents yesterday urged people to stay away from rivers, quarries and lakes and instead head to beaches, lidos and swimming pools.

David Walker, head of leisure safety at RoSPA, said: ‘Among the hazards to consider at inland waters are that, even on a hot day, water might be a lot colder than you were expecting and there may be strong currents and underwater debris that you can’t see from the bank.

‘Consider how you are going to get out of the water before you get in, and be honest about your ability to look after yourself.’
