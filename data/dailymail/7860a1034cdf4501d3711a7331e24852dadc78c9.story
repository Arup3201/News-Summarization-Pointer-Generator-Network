The younger brother of Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has been found guilty of raping and sexually assaulting his daughter from the age of four.

Liam Adams, 58, a one-time IRA commander, has been convicted of attacking his child Aine, who waived her right to anonymity to help bring him to justice.

The 40-year-old was attacked over a six-year period between 1977 and 1983 when she was aged between four and nine. 

After the verdicts she said: 'I can now begin my life at 40 and lay to rest the memory of the five-year-old girl who was abused'.

On trial: Liam Adams, 58, arrives at Belfast Crown Court, where he was found guilty of sexually abusing his daughter Aine, who was hugged after the verdict yesterday

Bespectacled Adams, who was wearing a grey suit, cream shirt and blue tie, showed no emotion as the guilty verdicts were returned at Belfast Crown Court yesterday.

Family: Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams had confronted his brother about abuse in 1987 and threatened to hit him with a hammer

Adams, who walks with the aid of a stick and used a court hearing aid to
 follow proceedings, stood between two prison officers in the dock with 
his hands clasped tightly.

Aine Adams, who was surrounded by family members, wept and clutched her younger sister Sinead for support.

On
 the other side of the public gallery, Adams's second wife Bronagh and 
their daughter Claire, who gave evidence in his defence, also cried. Adams nodded to them as he was led to the cells.

During the trial Aine Adams gave graphic details of the abuse, which started when she was aged four.

The first time she recalled being raped was while her mother was in hospital giving birth to her younger brother Conor in 1977.

In
 another incident she was raped by her father at a flat on Belfast's 
Antrim Road while her brother was asleep in the bed beside her.

Adams, who was a heavy drinker, also forced his daughter to perform sex acts.

In
 a statement read out by a police officer outside the court, Ms Adams 
said she could finally begin to move on after a long and hard road to 
achieve justice.

'I do not see this verdict as a victory or a 
celebration as it has taken its toll and has caused hurt, heartache and 
anguish for all those involved,' she said.

Hurt: Victim Aine Adams said after the guilty verdicts she was ready to get on with her life

Leaving court: Aine Adams (third right), daughter of Liam Adams, is supported by family and friends after the trial ended yesterday

The allegations were first made public when Ms Adams took part in a television documentary in 2009.

Revelations: Gerry Adams niece Aine allowed herself to be named for a 2009 documentary (pictured) where she accused her father of years of abuse

A
 short time later, Gerry Adams revealed his father Gerry Snr, a veteran 
IRA man, had physically and sexually abused members of his family.

Within
 days of the sex abuse scandal hitting the headlines, Liam Adams fled to
 the Republic claiming he could not receive a fair trial in Northern 
Ireland. He handed himself in to police in Co Sligo but could not be 
detained because the Garda officers did not have the correct 
documentation.

He was eventually handed over to the Police Service of
 Northern Ireland (PSNI) at the border in November 2011 after losing a 
lengthy and expensive extradition battle.

The trial opened in April this year but collapsed due to legal reasons and the jury was discharged.

At
 that time, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was called as a prosecution 
witness. He told the court he confronted his brother about the 
allegations during a meeting in Buncrana, Co Donegal, in 1987 and Liam 
Adams had denied the abuse.

He then revealed his brother later confessed while they were out walking together in the rain in Dundalk, Co Louth, in 2000.

Gerry Adams was not called as a prosecution witness for the latest trial, which re-opened before a new jury panel last month.

In her statement given outside Laganside court complex, Ms Adams thanked the media for helping her to tell her story.

She
 said: 'I would like to give all my family a special thanks. Without 
their love, support and understanding I would not be here today.'

She also expressed gratitude to the PSNI's public protection unit and the Public Prosecution Service.

'I would now ask for some privacy for my family to reflect on recent trying times,' she said.

Adams is due to be sentenced next month.

In a statement issued tonight Gerry Adams described the trial of his brother as tough.

The Sinn Fein president said: 'This has been a difficult and distressing ordeal for all my family and for my niece Aine.

'I would ask the media to respect our right to space and privacy.

'I thank the many people who have sent messages of support and solidarity.'
