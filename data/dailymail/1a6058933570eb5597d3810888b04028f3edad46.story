A controversial recently elected Detroit city councilman denies he took police on a chase while smoking marijuana and drinking and says he was racially profiled.

George Cushingberry Jr, 61, was pulled over Tuesday night
around 10pm but let go after a supervisor and several police officers decided
to let him off with a warning.

Early reports suggested he was leaving a strip club, had an
open bottle of alcohol in the car and smelled of marijuana, but the politician
fired back in a series of interviews in the past 24 hours.

On the defensive: Detroit City Councilman George Cushingberry Jr. talks about the traffic stop during a Detroit Free-Press interview

‘It’s a part of what I call the driving while black syndrome
amongst these white cops in Detroit who pick on people with old cars,’ he told WXYZ.

A Detroit News report said that Mr Cushingberry was leaving
Starvin Marvin’s strip club, on the city’s northwest side, and almost hit two
police officers.

Police sources told the paper that more than one squad car
had to chase him down before he finally stopped. Cops claim they spotted an
open bottle of liquor and smelled marijuana.

Authorities then claimed that he tried to take off again
once stopped.

The councilman was pulled over more than six miles south of
the strip club.

Several officers then decided to let him go with a ticket
for a traffic infraction.

Mr Cushingberry gave a far different account of what
happened in interviews with both WXYZ and the Detroit Free-Press.

In an outdoor interview from near the Penthouse Lounge,
where he claimed to be eating dinner at with a friend, Mr Cushingberry told
WXYZ that he never went to a strip club.

‘[After leaving] I was pulled over by the police… I was a
little down there,’ he said pointing down the street. ‘I was asked ‘turn the
car off!’ and I got scared, I didn’t know what I was doing.

‘I wait 10 minutes and nobody comes, I turn the car back on,
[the officer] jumps out of the car and tells me that I was trying to get away,’
he added, saying he drives an ‘old Buick.’

‘There was no police chase,’ he told the station. He turned
the car back on for warmth.

Mr Cushingberry then explained the marijuana odor came from
passenger Richard Clement, a medical marijuana card holder, having some in a
belt holster.

The Detroit News also reported Mr Clement having a medical
marijuana card.

‘They grabbed both of us and handcuffed us to the back of
the car in the 10 below zero weather as if we were some kind of criminals,’ Mr
Cushingberry recalled.

He showed his city council identification and a driver’s
license ‘to show I’m no criminal.’ He vehemently denied smoking marijuana in
the car.

‘I wasn’t doing anything wrong,’ he said, explaining the
liquor bottle was empty and in the back of the car – no drinking had taken
place in the car, it was left over from a previous event.

On the job less than two weeks: Mr Cushingberry was recently elected, but he's already managed to generate controversy

‘They found an old bottle, the reason the patrol supervisor
let me go was because it was empty,’ said the politician, admitting they had a
single drink during dinner – but that the lack of sobriety tests proved he was
sober.

Police decided to call in a supervisor, who Mr Cushingberry
told the Free-Press ‘could see how bogus’ the ordeal was, explaining why he and
his friend were let go.

‘They had nine cops come and talk to me, they knew I wasn’t
drunk,’ said Mr Cushingberry.

He was issued a ticket for ‘failure to signal,’ according to
the Free Press. A practicing lawyer, he told the paper intends to fight it.

Mr Cushingberry was recently elected as president pro-tem,
or second in command of the council. He blamed the stop on racial profiling.

Hellion activities: Mr Cushingberry defended telling the Detroit News to 'go to hell' and said he stands by the comments

A police spokesperson declined to comment to the Free-Press,
citing an investigation into how the stop was handled, but said ‘there may be
criminal charges’ filed against Mr Cushingberry.

The incident puts a bow on what has been a wild week for Mr
Cushingberry.

A Detroit News editorial from Tuesday called him a terrible
choice for pro-tem, ‘an old-school political operative’ and offered him up as
proof ‘the council is setting itself up to fall back into bad habits.’

He responded in a colorful Facebook post that drew
widespread condemnation.

‘Dear Detroit News: Go to hell. Go straight to hell. Do not
pass go and don’t even think about collecting $200. Jones and Cush will lead
the push for an even greater Detroit.’

The paper responded sharply.

'We can take it. What we can’t take is the real likelihood that Cushingberry and crew will continue the Detroit City Council tradition of taking the city to hell.'

The post has since been deleted, and the politician claimed
a staffer had wrote it – but he stood by the comments in a bizarre Fox Detroit
interview.

‘That’s the truth, he told the station. ‘They can take all
that straight to hell because that's hellion activities.’
