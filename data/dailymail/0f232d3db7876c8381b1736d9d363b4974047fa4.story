Gus Poyet fears the constant threat of disciplinary action risks turning players into ‘robots’.

Sunderland were fined £20,000 this week for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion during the 1-1 draw with Everton at the Stadium of Light earlier this month. 

The FA charge was in response to the team’s reaction to Lee Mason’s decision to award Everton a penalty.

Poyet, though, believes excessive and repeated sanction is dangerous for the game and says he was surprised by the fine in this instance.

‘I think there's a line,’ he said, reacting to the punishment. ‘Let's not make people lose our passion, because then we become robots.

‘I was disappointed because I didn't think it was that bad. It wasn't a bad image of football. I didn't expect (the fine). I wasn't even thinking about it. I accept it when there's a mistake but there's a line of passion and not caring. Don't go too much down the line otherwise it'll be “yes sir, yes sir”.

‘We'll try to change, because we've learned from a silly mistake, but don't bring that line lower and lower where you become robots.’
