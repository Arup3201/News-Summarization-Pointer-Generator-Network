Newcastle are closing in on the signing of Spain Under-19 internationals Jorge Mere and David Concha.

The Magpies have good contacts in Spain and unearthed one of the signings of the summer when they paid just £1.6million for Tenerife striker Ayoze Perez.

The 21-year-old has won a regular starting place having scored five times in his debut season and already there has been talk of Manchester United casting admiring eyes.

And Perez is now playing his part in luring his young countrymen to Tyneside.

Concha has already visited the club’s stadium and training facilities and was a guest during the 1-0 defeat at home to Sunderland in December.

The 18-year-old winger – who has previously turned down an offer from Brentford - will be loaned back to Racing Santander for the remainder of the season as they battle relegation from Spain’s second-tier.

Mere, meanwhile, is a classy 17-year-old centre-back who plays for Sporting Gijon. He will also remain in Spain until the summer.

Newcastle announced that John Carver would remain in charge until the end of the season
