Thieves have stolen the laptop of a 12-year-old boy then hacked into his Facebook account and left mocking messages.

Christian Swan also lost several tailor-made dance costumes he was planning to use for an upcoming performance when the burglars broke in to the family's loan car between 1pm and 5pm on Saturday in a south Auckland car park.

Swan then found his Facebook account had been hacked into by the thieves, who wrote insulting messages to taunt the Belmore Intermediate student, New Zealand Herald has reported.

The cruel message that was posted on his Facebook: Swan said the ordeal had left him shaken, fearing the thieves would be able to find his home

Swan found the following message on his account: 'HA HA ARE YOU MISSING ANYTHING BETCH CATCH ME IF YOU CAN IM THE GINGER BREAD MAN.'

The car, which was on loan from a mechanic, was later found defaced and abandoned in South Auckland, with a kicked in door and a blown-gasket.

Christian, his mother and three sisters, were at a Sound of Music performance when the vehicle was broken into.

His parents Matt and Penny say the stolen goods valued at over $3000 might not be covered by insurance.

Swan said the ordeal had left him shaken, fearing the thieves would be able to find his home.

He said the items he most wants returned are the costumes, which were needed for a dance performance next month.

'I don't think the guys that stole them will use them, unless anyone sees them dressed up in troll suits in Otara,' he told New Zealand Herald.

Christian's father Matt Swan said he was in 'total disbelief' about the ordeal.

'Like he needed salt rubbed in the wound? 

'I felt sick. What values have these culprits had instilled in them as youngsters? Clearly not the values that we instil in our children.'

A police spokesperson has confirmed the car was found in Otara town centre on Monday, and the investigation is ongoing.
