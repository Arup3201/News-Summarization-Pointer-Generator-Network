Texas high school student Andrew Muennink this week negotiated a unique deal with his art class teacher: If he gets a photo of him and the teacher retweeted 15,000 times, the class won't have to take a final exam.

If that sounds too good to be true, it's because it is. Round Rock High School officials say that despite the agreement, students will have to take the test, no matter how man retweets Muennink gets.

But Muennink refuses to give in to reality. 'A deal was made and it should be owned up to,' he told

ABC News.

An unidentified student holds a sign saying if this photo gets 100,000 retweets, he will not have to take a final. His teacher (right) is not amused.

At last count, Muennink had garnered more than 10,500 retweets.

Muennink's first offer to Cindy House, his art teacher, was a relatively low 5,000 tweets. That wasn't high enough for House, and the pair eventually settled on 15,000 tweets.

'I try my best and the final is supposed to be so hard, so I was like, 'I have a lot of followers on Twitter,"' he told ABC News.

If the deal had held up, Muennink had until May 23 at noon to reached the agreed-upon amount, or else the final was on.

Students at other schools have followed Muennink's initiative and have also posted photos on Twitter with similar deals, although there's no word on whether those students did it in jest.

'I think [other schools] should [do this] because it's really cool how Twitter can be an influence,' Muennink said.
