She's been designing for the high street brand since 2006, but it seems it's the end of the road for Kelly Brook and New Look.

According to reports in The Sun, the fashion retailer and the model-turned-designer are parting ways.

A source told the paper that while the collaboration brought both parties good money, the 35-year-old's love life is to blame.

According to reports, Kelly Brook is no longer working with high street fashion retailer New Look, for whom she's been designing since 2006

The source said: 'Kelly's reputation has changed recently because she's being talked about for her dodgy relationships, especially with David.

'She wasn't seen as a good fit going forward for the brand.'

A friend of Kelly's did, however, claim it was the model who decided to end ties with the fashion brand, citing her burgeoning acting career as the reason.

Kelly, who is keen to pursue a career as a thespian, is currently based in LA while working on her new US sitcom, One Big Happy.

Kelly began designing swimwear, left, for the store back in 2006 and has since gone on to launch lingerie and clothing collections for the brand

The friend explained that producers are keen for her to focus her time on the role and be primarily based in Hollywood. 

A spokesman for New Look refused to comment. 

MailOnline has contacted a spokesperson for Kelly Brook.

Kelly launched a swimwear collection with the store back in 2006 and lucrative and successful collections followed, including lingerie and clothes. 

Kelly has plenty of other projects on the go. Just last month the model and TV star was unveiled as the ambassador for the New Atkins Nutritional Approach - and was following the diet to help her 'get fit and feel great' after a hectic 2014.

Despite her new approach to her health, the size 10 star who recently created a plus-size range for of figure-flattering dresses and neat tummy-controlling skirts available in sizes 10-32 for Simply Be, maintains that she is still proud of her figure.

'I’m confident I will achieve fantastic results with Atkins, but don't worry, I’m proud of my curves and they aren't going anywhere!' she said at the time. 

In terms of her private life, after her tumultuous relationship with on-off ex-fiance David McIntosh came to an end, Kelly has been notably single and seemingly happy to mingle.

And now she is alleged to have found romance again in the form of handsome model James Lee Taylor, who she is said to have met back in November on the set of a Sketchers shoe advert.

The chiselled hunk has been posting pictures of Kelly on his Twitter account since the pair first met two months ago.
