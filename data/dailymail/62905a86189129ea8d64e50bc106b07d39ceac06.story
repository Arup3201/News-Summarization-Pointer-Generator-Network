Foreign airports can be scary and confusing places with any number of dangers just waiting to trip you up - especially if the warning signs are all in Chinese.

So to keep safe, just remember to avoid 'landslides' in the lounge, the 'flesh juice' in the canteen and the 'mind crotch' on the stairs... and whatever you do, never 'bomb into the ash' in the smoking area.

But if you ever do fall foul of any of these hidden perils, remember... you can always pull the 'Emergency Door Cock'.

These are just some of the bizarre - and befuddling - translations of everyday signage pictured in airports across the Far East. And they make for a rather baffling read.

Visitors to airports across Asia captured some of the more amusing translations, posting their pictures of signs and labels on an online blog.

Scroll down for video.

In an airport?: What appears to be a 'Careful: Slippery surface' sign has been labelled 'Be careful of landslide' in this Chinese bathroom

Appetising: A sign in Japan advertises fresh fruit juice is translated as a rather less appetising 'flesh juice'

Befuddling: If you don't know what a mind crotch is, then it is best to avoid this Chinese airport, while smokers in Beijing International Airport should never 'bomb into the ash here', right

Unnerving: If you ever do fall foul of any of these hidden perils, remember... you can always pull the 'Emergency Door Cock' at Taipei Airport in Taiwan

Found on everything from poorly 
translated signs and menus to bizarrely worded adverts and strange 
t-shirt slogans the mis-use of English can be found everywhere.

Scroll down to see the latest collection of amusingly 'creative' English from around the world.

The results include simple 
translations that have been worded perhaps more bluntly than European travellers might be used
 to - such as a row of seats reserved for the 'old, weak and pregnant'.

Passengers at one airport were informed that their flight had been 'delayed for some reasons'.

Helpful: A series of photographs posted on an online blog details bizarre and hilarious English translations in airports across Asia

Communication breakdown: A toilet has been reserved for the 'weal only' (left) while a metal bin before airport security has been designated as a 'liquid abandoned place'

Nappy swap: Travellers are informed of an unusual in-flight service, a 'baby diaper exchange'

Blunt: A row of seats in one Chinese airport has been reserved for the 'old, weak and pregnant', right, while a bin has usefully been designated for 'unrecycling' waste

The vernacular mismatch also leads to a bin labelled for 'unrecycling' and a useful sign telling people to 'mind crotch'.

Since being posted online, the signs gone viral as internet-users share them with 
friends and send in other wacky suggestions they've found themselves on 
their travels.

Other
 translations have been confused as much for cultural as linguistic 
reasons, evidenced by what appears to be 'careful: slippery surface' 
sign, labelled 'Be careful of landslide'.

There
 is also a charity donation box asking travellers to donate cash to help
 'especially difficult children'. It is almost full to the brim.

Muddle: Even the most considerate of travellers might find it difficult to understand this message

Romance: For sanitation purposes you should only share your can with a lover

Full: It might prove a rather difficult task to squeeze any more money into this box for 'especially difficult children'

Meanwhile
 a Japanese sign asks parents, not, apparently, to throw away their 
child's dirty nappies, but to take them to the 'baby diaper exchange'.

Some
 are so confusing that it is impossible to even guess what the sign is 
asking frequent fliers to do, such as a sign above the door of a Chinese
 aeroplane that asks passengers to 'Gets hold of arm rest to fall the 
wound carefully'.

There is even a Chinese vending 
machine that urges thirsty travellers not to share their cans of drink 
with anyone - unless they are 'not the lovers'.

Mannerly: Visitors are welcomed by a sign telling them they are entering a 'civilized airport'

Parent and child: Users of an escalator are told to look after their 'oldster' as well as child

Honest mistake: A simple misspelling labels a 'fire fydrant'
