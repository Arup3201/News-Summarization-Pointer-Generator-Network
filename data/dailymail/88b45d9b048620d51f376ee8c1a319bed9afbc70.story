Allegation: Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said he may unmask someone 'much more important' than Cyril Smith who allegedly abused boys at the notorious Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London

The MP who exposed the paedophilia of the late Cyril Smith is threatening to name another former senior politician alleged to have had sex with children.

Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, where one of his predecessors was Smith, said he may unmask someone 'much more important' who allegedly abused boys at the notorious Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London, which was used as a venue for a paedophile ring of VIPs.

'I have been contacted by people making serious allegations.' The MP says he could use parliamentary privilege - which would give him legal immunity - to name the former influential MP.

He added: 'It would be best for him to come forward of his own volition, but I would consider using privilege to name the parliamentarian.'

Mr Danczuk spoke as it emerged that disgraced former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers faces questioning over an alleged cover-up of child abuse at Knowl View School, a special school in Rochdale linked to local Liberal MP Smith.

Over three decades, boys as young as seven were repeatedly abused at the school by Smith and his cohorts.

It was described as 'a sweet shop for paedophiles' and pupils were driven to public toilets to have sex with men who had travelled from all over the North.

In 2012 - two years after Smith's death - the Crown Prosecution Service admitted the MP should have been charged with historic child sex offences.

At the time of the alleged cover-up, ex-Methodist minister Flowers was vice-chairman of the social services committee at Rochdale Council, which oversaw Knowl View School.

He is to face claims that he and other Rochdale councillors ignored a series of damning reports detailing the abuse.

This week Flowers, 63, who has been charged with three counts relating to possession of cocaine, ketamine and crystal meth, will receive a letter saying he must answer questions from Andrew Warnock QC, who is leading the investigation into the council's handling of the allegations.

Nine others are also part of the investigation. There is no suggestion Flowers, who was also on the council's education committee, was involved in any form of abuse at Knowl View, but his time on the council coincides with key developments in the alleged cover-up.

Colin Lambert, leader of Rochdale Council, said: 'The letter is quite strong, and they should be worried because the allegation is that they took part in a cover-up. So if they knew and decided not to do anything that is a very serious matter.

'There are criminal issues here.'

Fears that vulnerable young boys were being abused at the school were repeatedly raised between 1988 and 1992, when Flowers held key council posts.

Three reports were issued detailing serious sexual abuse at Knowl View, yet no one was ever held to account.

It was not until 1994 that the matter was raised again when the reports were discovered by the school's head of care, Martin Digan.

Mr Warnock's inquiry will cover the years 1985 to 1995 and will focus on whether there was a cover-up.
