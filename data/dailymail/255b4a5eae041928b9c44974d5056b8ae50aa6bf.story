An amazing image revealing some mysterious phenomena in a gigantic galaxy-cluster collision has been revealed.

In the region, where clusters of hundreds of galaxies are colliding, a rich variety of objects are visible only to radio telescopes.

Scientists created a ‘true colour’ image of the region to reveal what it would look like if humans could see radio waves, rather than just visible light.

Researchers have released an amazing image of Abell 2566. In the annotated image (move the slider to see the markings), the point sources (examples in red) are galaxies like ours. Blue objects are radio galaxies with streams of plasma, and in green is the 'Large Relic', which could be a shockwave as the clusters collide.

Researchers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) made the image using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico.

In the image, red colouration shows longer radio waves, moving down to blue, which is composed of shorter radio waves.

The region is known as Abell 2256, and is about 800 million light-years from Earth and about four million light-years across.

The image covers an area in the sky almost as large as the full moon.

In the image, the multiple ‘dots’ that can be seen are ‘normal, everyday galaxies’ as big as the Milky Way, Dr Jean Eilek of the NRAO told MailOnline.

A radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous at radio wavelengths.

It is usually composed of two jets being expelled from a large elliptical galaxy.

Radio galaxies can be detected at large distances, which makes then useful tools in studying the structure of the universe.

‘Star formation in such galaxies is a strong source of radio waves, which come from supernova remnants and cosmic rays that are energised in the star formation regions.’

There is also a handful of objects known as radio galaxies, which each have a massive central black hole that emits jets of plasma.

‘In clusters like this the unusual shapes of the radio galaxies are due to the interaction of those jets with the cluster atmosphere,’ Dr Eilek continued.

‘We don't yet understand just why each of those sources have the shapes they have - we’re still working on that.

‘But these are definitely radio galaxies in the cluster; we think the merger happening in the cluster has something to do with the large number and unusual shapes of these radio galaxies.’

Resarchers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) made the image using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, shown here. The VLA is at an altitude of 6970ft (2125 metres) and consists of 27 independent antennae

Two of these, towards the right-hand side of the image, have long trails with them. This may be due to them speeding very fast through the cluster, with their plasma left behind in a tail.

Perhaps the most notable part of the image is, as Dr Eilek calls it, the ‘big fuzzy thing’ to the upper right.

This is known as the Large Relic, and it is a million light-years across but its formation is a mystery.

‘One possibility is that this is a huge shockwave, caused when the two clusters ram together supersonically,’ said Dr Eilek.

However, she notes that it could also be a ‘reconnection layer’, where magnetic fields are pushed together until they annihilate.

This same process is thought to drive solar flares in our sun, and also Earth’s aurorae.
