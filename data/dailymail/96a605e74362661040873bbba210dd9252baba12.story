Thatcher tribute? Mrs Cameron chose a neat hat and pussy bow blouse

She was perhaps paying tribute to the Iron Lady, famous for her political wardrobe of pillbox hats and pussy-bow blouses.

But Samantha Cameron’s choice of outfit to Baroness Thatcher’s funeral failed to take off with fashion watchers.

Her gold pussy-bow blouse and neat grey hat inspired a bout of mild teasing on Twitter, where she was likened to an air stewardess.

Some even reworked her nickname, dubbing the Prime Minister’s wife ‘PanAm SamCam’.

One user, Vivienne Clore asked: ‘Why 
did Sam Cam come dressed as a flight attendant?’ Rosie Ellis wrote: ‘Sam
Cam is channelling her inner air hostess with choice of outfit today. I
keep expecting her to point out the exits.’

And Nizaar Kinsella said: ‘I’m sure I saw SamCam working on my EasyJet flight the other day.’

As a fashion power player, Mrs Cameron puts a lot of thought into her attire.

She knows clothes deliver a message – 
hence her prudent ‘recycling’ of the same clothes for public 
engagements, and her desire to team expensive pieces with low-cost 
brands such as Zara, Topshop and Hobbs.

For high-profile occasions, Mrs Cameron 
usually looks the antithesis of a traditional Tory wife, choosing to 
champion up-and-coming and edgy British labels such as Alessandra Rich 
or Jonathan Saunders.

Distinctive style: Mrs Cameron could not have chosen a more fitting sartorial tribute, 
looking elegant but demure as she arrived at Westminster Abbey with her 
husband

True blues: Samantha held the PM's hand as they walked to the service, a dark wool coat worn over her skirt and Paul & Joe blouse and an elegant sinamay hat, mirroring a style often wore by Baroness Thatcher

And because fussy buttoned-up necklines are strictly not her usual style, it’s all the more unthinkable that yesterday’s blouse, teamed with a black pencil skirt, nude Jimmy Choo ‘Agnes’ heels, costing £360, and dark grey pillbox hat, was unintentional.

The pussy-bow is a style that our first and only woman prime minister trademarked during her tenure, most notably during a photocall aboard the ‘Thatcher Battle Bus’, ahead of her first election victory in 1979.

Pussy-bow blouses first became fashionable in the 1940s, but the sterner more buttoned-up power dressing version we know today found favour in the late 1970s and remained popular throughout the 1980s.

Seen as the feminine equivalent to a man’s shirt and tie, the style became the office staple for a new generation of women in male-dominated offices who wanted to look powerful but feminine.

No wonder then, that Lady Thatcher wore a great many versions of this look to one of the most masculine of all work places – Parliament.

Substance over style: The Baroness said she always aimed to dress appropriately - and that didn't mean forgoing femininity

The bows, which she personally deemed ‘softening and pretty’ were used to temper the formal skirt suits that were the complementary weapon in her power-dressing armoury.

‘What you do is decide the clothes in which you are comfortable,’ she said at the time.

‘You must be comfortable. You are going to a great occasion. It must be a style that you are comfortable in.

'It must be a fabric that you are comfortable in, that hangs well, and you must know that you look appropriate for the occasion. Never flashy, just appropriate.’

Monochrome Choice: Cherie Blair's hat resembled a cake tin while Norma Major teamed a pearl necklace with a white trimmed hat

Formal: Harriet Harman dressed in a traditional fedora hat while Theresa may's headwear was inspired by Downton Abbey

Which is more than can be said for Mrs Cameron, whose outfits have caused controversy – and plenty of Twitter debate – before.

Her decision to wear a jewelled hairpiece, rather than a hat, to the Royal wedding two years ago caused much consternation, as did some of her outfits during the Camerons’ Washington visit last year.

However, Lady Thatcher would perhaps have approved of Mrs Cameron’s frugal approach to dressing.

Although the gold blouse by French designer Paul & Joe was a hefty £280, she has worn it twice before – to a tea party in 2008, then to her daughter Florence’s christening in 2011.

Mrs Cameron did seem to get the dress code right in one respect: Neat millinery was the order of  the day, with political wives and celebrities all opting for small  chic hats.

Carol Thatcher’s chic felt fascinator featured an over-sized bow and Crown Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece chose a small hat topped with a circle of net and a brooch embellishment.

Subtle Sarah: Mrs brown chose neat millinery

While Sarah Brown got the memo, perching her hat decorated with a birdcage veil and flower on the back of her head, Cherie Blair missed the mark with a large hat reminiscent of a cake tin covered in satin.

Dame Shirley Bassey chose to keep warm in a trim fur beret, while Dame Norma Major, wife of former prime minister Sir John, opted for a classic black and white hat, which she teamed with a double string of pearls.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s wife Miriam looked effortlessly chic in a flat saucer hat with a sculpted veil, which she wore to the side of her head.

Foreign Secretary William Hague’s wife Ffion wore an elegant black velvet pillbox hat, and Labour leader Ed Miliband’s wife Justine wore a pillbox hat that was subtle and discreet.

Less successful were the choices of deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman and Home Secretary Theresa May.

While Miss Harman opted for a casual-looking felt fedora, Mrs May managed to obscure most of her face with a 1920s style hat, featuring a large satin bow, which could have come straight off the set of Downton Abbey.

The rest of her outfit did just the trick however, as she paired a black pencil skirt with a cropped black suit jacket buttoned at the waist.

Mrs May limited her accessories to a simple brooch, leather gloves and a pair of her signature kitten heels.

She was accompanied by her husband of 32 years, investment banker husband Philip.

Taking the plunge: Katherine Jenkins yesterday

The guest list was certainly eclectic. But some mourners had no difficulty standing out from the crowd.

Namely classical singer Katherine Jenkins, who seemed determined to show-off her curves in a plunging cocktail-style dress and flared overcoat.

The 32-year-old mezzo-soprano, who is thought to have met Baroness Thatcher through their charity work for the Armed Forces, sparked outrage on Twitter from users who thought the dress was inappropriate for the stately occasion.

AngelaReedFox, said: ‘Just for a change, or perhaps in honour of the occasion, Katherine Jenkins could have put her cleavage away.’

Hilary McGowan said she was ‘not sure Katherine Jenkins’s cleavage is appropriate’, while WellWilk added: ‘I think Katherine Jenkins could have put her cleavage away for just one day #thatcherfuneral.’

Fortunately from the neck upwards, Miss Jenkins, a favourite of the Royal family who has lunched privately with the Queen, was the epitome of elegance in a black Philip Treacy pillbox hat with netting.
