Brave: Shammi Atwal was pushed under the wheels of a lorry as he fought a gang of six men who robbed his business and wife

Six masked robbers who pushed a father-of-two under the wheels of a lorry as he defended his wife were jailed for more than 70 years today.

The gang made up of five Lithuanians and a Qatari-born Briton stormed the Glen & Co cash-and-carry run by Shammi Atwal, 45, in Barking, Essex, wielding iron bars and sledgehammers.

Mr Atwal gave chase to defend his partner Damanjeet Kaur after one of the raiders dragged her out of the office by her hair and snatched her handbag.

But he was crushed to death when one of the robbers pushed him into the path of an oncoming lorry in October last year.

The thieves had only managed to grab £1,000 which was in the stolen handbag.

Lithuanians Deibidas Sumskas, 25, Edgaras  Balezantis, 25, Vidmantas Gonskoves, 26, Aurimas Diliunas, 27, Reiniks Kivers, 27, and Farhan Sheikh, 38, who was born in Qatar, were all found guilty of manslaughter and robbery after a trial.

They were jailed for a total of 71 years and eight months at the Old Bailey.

Judge Nicholas Hilliard, Common Serjeant of London, commended Mr Atwal's bravery and courage and said his last thoughts were 'undoubtedly for his wife'.

He said: 'All six defendants have been found guilty on the unanimous verdicts of the jury of manslaughter and conspiracy to rob.

'The conspiracy was put into effect and in the course of the robbery Shammi Atwal was killed.

'He was 45 years old, a married man with two children aged seven and four.

'In a moving statement Damanjeet Kaur his widow describes what was their 'perfect little family' and all that they had to look forward to.

'What you men did has had devastating and catastrophic consequences on the family who have to live with this for the rest of their lives, long after you are released from the sentences I have passed today.

'No sentence I pass today can make up for what you have done and the pain you have caused.

'None of you has shown what I regard as any genuine remorse of regret at all for taking Mr Atwal's life or for the consequences on his two small children.'

Jailed: Edgaras Balezantis, left, received a sentence of  11 years and four months while Farhan Sheikh was given 13 years

Habitual criminals: Reiniks Kivers, left, who has carried out offences across Europe got 13 years and  Vidmantas Gonskoves received more than 11 years

The raid was carefully planned and the killers lay in wait outside the premises for an hour plotting for the right moment to strike.

The gang of at least ten men made sure that the guard dogs had all left before storming the building.

Two of the men barged into the office where Mrs Kaur was and Diliunas dragged her outside by the hair.

She was terrified and said: 'I thought they were racists come to kill us.'

But the desperate thieves could not find what they were looking for - the company safe which had between £10,000 and £12,000 cash in it.

'They couldn't find what they wanted quickly enough and so they left still brandishing weapons as seen on the CCTV,' Judge Hilliard said.

He added: 'No one has remarked upon Shammi Atwal's courage and bravery.

'Mrs Kaur can be sure of this - her husband intervened in the robbery whilst it was going on with considerable courage to try and stop the robbers getting away with his wife's bag.

'His last thoughts were undoubtedly for her.

'What happened was this - one of you pushed Mr Atwal and he went under the wheels of a passing lorry which was being driven entirely lawfully along the road by the gates of Glen & Co.

'Mr Atwal died from the injuries he received.'

He continued: 'You must all know who it was but none of you has said who it was.

'Any offence of manslaughter is of course serious because a precious life has been taken unlawfully.

'What makes this offence particularly serious is its context - it was committed in the course of robbery.'

Kivers and Diliunas both have a string of previous convictions including robbery, burglary, theft and blackmail for offences committed across Europe including in Spain and Lithuania.

In a statement read to the court Mrs Kaur said her husband was the 'most loving father' and his family 'cannot cope' without him.

'I loved my husband with all my heart and he loved his family and children,' she said.

'Our life was a perfect little family and we had so much to look forward to.'

The gang had travelled to the scene in at least one BMW car, a black series 5 BMW saloon, last October 14.

They were dressed in dark clothing with hoods or masks over their faces and some of them wore gloves.

The raiders carried out the merciless attack on those who worked there, intent on taking whatever cash was there.

But the cost to the business and those who worked there was considerably greater.

They threatened anyone in their path and assaulted Ms Kaur in the raid.

The six defendants, each dressed casually, were joined in the dock by multiple Lithuanian interpreters.

Sheikh is a British national but the other five killers could face deportation, the case will be considered by the Secretary of State.

Kivers, of no fixed address, and Sheikh, of Thornhill Gardens, Barking, were both sentenced to 13 years behind bars.

Diliunas, of Rosslyn Road, Barking, was given 11 years and eight months imprisonment.

Balezantis, of Tollgate road, East Ham, Sumskas, of Ottley Road, Victoria Docks, and Gonskoves, of Grange Road, Plaistow, were each jailed for 11 years and four months.
