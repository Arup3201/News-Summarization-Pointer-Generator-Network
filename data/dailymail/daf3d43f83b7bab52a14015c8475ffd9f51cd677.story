A British mother is fighting for her life after falling 30ft onto a concrete ledge during a romantic trip to the Italian city of Pisa.

Rommily Gill was rushed to hospital after plummeting from a walkway next to the River Arno in front of her horrified boyfriend.

It is understood the 33-year-old suffered multiple fractures in the accident, at around 3.30am on Sunday morning, after losing her balance.

Italian police say that Miss Gill, from Dunoon, Argyll, and boyfriend Derek Cooper had spent the evening in the medieval city centre.

Passers-by called the emergency  services after finding Mr Cooper in a distressed state at the roadside.

Firefighters had to hoist his girlfriend, who runs her own company making designer handbags, on a stretcher back up to street level.

An ambulance then took her to the city’s Cisanello hospital where she remains in a coma.

Her condition yesterday was described as ‘critical’.

Police said that the couple had been staying at the Hotel Cecile in the city centre for a romantic mini-break.

Hotel staff said that Mr Cooper was keeping a vigil by his girlfriend’s hospital bed. Other family members were due to arrive last night.

Meanwhile, police launched an investigation to establish why Miss Gill fell.

Francesco Tagliente, the prefect of Pisa, said officers were investigating ‘in particular whether beer, wine or other alcoholic drinks had been sold between 12.30am and 3.30am to people who were already obviously in a state of intoxication, in violation of the penal code’.

Mr Tagliente said the couple had spent the evening drinking in various bars.

‘They were staying at the  Hotel Cecile for a romantic trip. Unfortunately it has ended badly,’ he said.

‘They went out on Saturday night, so there was quite a lively scene. They went to a few pubs, and parties.

‘They had some drinks and then somehow on the way home she slipped and fell from the parapet alongside the Arno onto a  concrete boardwalk.’

There have been several similar incidents in recent years, prompting authorities to put up warning signs in several European languages.

Recently, Miss Gill, who is believed to have a three-year-old son, had started her own business, calling herself Romster and making ‘funky bags and purses in vintage and retro prints’.

She is a regular stallholder at craft fairs held in the Merchant Square in Glasgow’s Merchant City. On her Facebook page,  she says: ‘Working from my sweatshop based in Dunoon, I make quirky bags & purses and some Jewellery too!

‘Each thing I make is always a little bit different, so each one is a one-off, made with love, sweat and occasionally a few tears (pin jabs hurt!)’

On her Twitter feed, she styles herself ‘Single Mum & Bad Ass. Dunoon.’

Her most recent post on Facebook was last Thursday when she changed her cover photo.

Last night, a friend, Laura Turner-Sattele, who appears on Miss Gill’s Facebook page modelling her handbags, said that she was shocked by what happened.

She added: ‘Rommily is a really good mother and really creative. She has not had any problems with drink or drugs. I have not heard from her in a while.’
