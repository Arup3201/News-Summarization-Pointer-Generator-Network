Married comedy legend Bill Cosby broke up with a 'longtime' mistress and decided to stop womanizing after suffering with a bout of middle-aged angst, a new book claims.

The 77-year-old entertainer has publicly admitted to cheating on Camille, his wife of 50 years and mother of his five children.

However, a new biography, Cosby: His Life and Times, by Mark Whitaker, details the full extent of his infidelity - and tells how the star invited the girlfriend and her MOM out to dinner following the break-up.

50 Years together: Bill and Camille Cosby's 50-year marriage has weathered storms, including the star's infidelity and the murder of their only son Ennis in January 1997. The couple are pictured in 2002

Before making his debut as doting dad, Dr Heathcliff Hutxtable on The Cosby Show in September 1984, then aged 47, the star is said to have decided to cut back on his womanizing.

The book also tells how the groundbreaking sitcom was borne out of Cosby's real family life and his tales as a father of five - and how he struggled after turning 40.

In an excerpt from the book published in The Hollywood Reporter; it reveals how Cosby - married to Camille since 1964 - was forced to come to grips with the 'frustrations of being a 
middle-aged man and father'.

It reads: 'In a comic essay for Ebony, Cosby even 
talked about how aging had affected his roving eye for women.'

'"One of 
the most important things when you turn 40 is that you weigh things 
thusly,' he wrote. 'You look at the enjoyment you may get from a given 
activity, and then you look at the amount of work that may have to go 
into it … for example, sex with a young beautiful woman who has plenty 
of energy".

'In a picture that accompanied the story, Cosby stood on a 
diving board, smoking a cigar, looking over his shoulder wistfully at a 
bikini-clad, mocha-skinned beauty.

'"One of those things you want but are
 glad you can't have," the caption read.

'Cosby didn't tell Ebony 
readers about another step that he had taken to prove that he was 
serious about cutting back on his womanizing.'

The excerpt adds: 'He told one longtime 
girlfriend that he wanted to put an end to their relationship, and then 
he invited the woman and her mother, who had always disapproved of her 
daughter being involved with a married man, out to dinner. "I'm very 
happy to be here," the mother told Cosby, "because I always thought you 
had more sense than that!"'

The book, out on September 16, is said to have been written with the help of Cosby and his 'inner circle'.

Cosby has long been dogged by accusations of infidelity - and has even faced accusations of sexual abuse.

In November 2006, Cosby, beloved by America for his role as a cosy, sweater-wearing dad, settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, 32, a former Temple University employee who claimed Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion in 2004. 

Thirteen other witnesses also came forward voluntarily with similar claims, People magazine reported.

Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but this was not Cosby's first sex scandal accusation.

In 1997, Autumn Jackson, then 22, came forward to say she was Cosby's illegitimate child from an affair the comedian had with her mother, Shawn Upshaw.

Jackson made the claims just days after the Cosbys' only son Ennis was shot and killed on a Los Angeles freeway on January 17, 1997 aged just 27.

Though Cosby admitted to having an affair with Upshaw - he would tell TV interviewer Dan Rather it was a 'rendezvous' - he maintained that Jackson was not his child.

Jackson was later convicted on charges of extortion for threatening to take her story to the tabloids unless Cosby paid her $40 million.

Groundbreaking: New biography Cosby: His Life and Times tells how The Cosby Show was borne out of Bill Cosby's real family life, with tales of his life as a father of five and the middle-aged angst he struggled with being woven in to the storylines

Asked by Oprah Winfrey in 2010 how the couple had weathered the storm of the entertainer's infidelity, Camille Cosby admitted she had known about her husband's affair with Upshaw 'back in the Seventies'.

Camille told how she had asked her husband to take a DNA test to be certain he was not the father of Jackson - saying if he had not, 'Autumn Jackson and her cohorts could continue with their story.'

Discussing a time when the Cosbys had focused on 'selfish needs', Camille said: 'We were both young. We had to go through a lot. It's difficult to learn to live with somebody, to be unselfish and to be responsible for your behavior - and even to think how you hurt others if you do certain things.

'You go through a transition, if you are committed to each other. You cleanse yourself of all of that baggage, and you look at each other and determine whether the relationship is worth salvaging, whether you really love each other and want to be together.

'Then you realize, 'Wait a minute. I might have been doing this because I just didn't want to think about how this would affect the other person or to allow myself to love someone with emotional intimacy'.'

Meanwhile, after celebrating his 77th birthday on July 12, Cosby made it clear that Camille still gets incites the flames of passion.

Indeed, earlier this week he left Tonight host Jimmy Fallon red-faced when he revealed that while he didn't get birthday cake, he did get birthday sex, or as he more charmingly phrased it, 'I got my wife!'

Cosby warned the late-night host, 39, that one day, he, too, might come across 'the most frightening thing that you can hear from your wife on your birthday when you are carrying on...'That, he explained, 'is to hear your wife, who is seven years younger than you, say, 'Keep going!''
