Together: Cara Delevingne and Michelle Rodriguez yesterday in a rickshaw near their hotel

She has admitted publicly that when it comes to her sexuality she ‘plays for more than one team’.

Now model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne has shown exactly what that means by locking herself away in a London hotel with Hollywood actress Michelle Rodriguez.

Burberry model Cara, 21, is said to have joined Michelle, 35, in her luxury suite at the five-star Charlotte Street Hotel in London’s West End – after they enjoyed trips together to New York and Paris.

Since arriving in London last week the
 couple have barely been apart. According to friends they have been 
‘hanging out’ – watching TV and indulging in room service in Michelle’s 
suite.

They have also indulged in a bizarre health treatment – with Cara
 tweeting pictures of them hand in hand hooked up to an infusion kit 
which delivers vitamins intravenously.

A friend said: ‘Michelle has an amazing suite and has been entertaining. She said that Cara has been over lots.’

The
 hotel has three loft suites which are designed over two floors and 
include an upstairs bedroom, a drawing room and granite and oak 
bathrooms with separate walk-in showers and twin basins.

The
 pair’s friendship has developed rapidly since they were introduced via 
pop star Rihanna, a mutual friend, earlier this month, and they are now 
said to be ‘inseparable’.

Their
 fondness for each other was first revealed during the New York trip 
when Cara kissed Michelle on the lips in full view of the crowd at a New
 York Knicks basketball game in Manhattan.

Then the pair met in Paris 
when Cara was on a catwalk assignment for Chanel.

The intimate friendship has been the talk of Hollywood where Michelle, who starred in Fast & Furious, is a big star.

The gossip columnist Perez Hilton 
recently wrote on his website that the girls appeared to be ‘going 
strong’ after enjoying a day out at a wild cat reserve in Nevada.

The actress has spoken openly about her closeness to Cara.

A friend said: ‘Michelle keeps her private life below the radar but she is definitely enjoying her time with Cara.

‘They are kindred spirits, they love partying, and share a sense of adventure and a love of fun. Cara  has been spending quite a bit of  time with Michelle. She is very open about it all.’

Michelle has also talked openly about her sexuality, and revealed in an interview last year: ‘I’ve gone both ways. I do as I please.

'I am too curious to sit here and not try when I can.’

She added: ‘Men are intriguing. So are chicks.’

A friend of Cara said: ‘She is just a young girl finding her feet.

'One minute Cara’s with a boy, another she’s with a girl.

'She gets obsessed with people very quickly and her friendships and relationships are always intense.’

Cara was previously linked to One Direction star Harry Styles.

This gruesome picture was tweeted by Cara on Friday – showing her  and Michelle Rodriguez hand in hand at their hotel having an intravenous vitamin infusion.

The cushion the girls are resting their arms on has the same spotted design as those that furnish the  £500-a-night suite where Cara and Michelle are staying.

Vitamin infusions are known as The Party Girl Drip and the Dial-A-Dracula Drip – because the kit can be delivered to private addresses.

They are a new fad, with celebrities such as Rosie Huntington Whiteley, Rihanna and Simon Cowell paying up to £400 hoping to boost the immune system and  cure hangovers. 

Cara is believed to have been introduced to vitamin infusions by her model sister, Poppy. 

Nutritionist Geeta Sidhu Robb, who runs The Infusion Clinic in London’s Harley Street, said: ‘It’s relatively painless and takes about 40 minutes. It is important that a nurse carries out the procedure.’
