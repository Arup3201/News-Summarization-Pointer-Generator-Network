A mother has released footage of her sixth-grade daughter being viciously attacked on the school bus in a desperate bid to provoke action.

Nikki Lee was shown the cell phone video on Friday, which documents the moment two girls set upon her on the way home last week in Jacksonville, Florida.

The girls can be seen kicking the child's head after pulling her hair, slapping her head, and jumping on top of her.

According to Mrs Lee, whose daughter's name has not been released, the bus driver did not intervene and all children from J.E.B Middle School were allowed to alight the bus. 

'They basically beat her like she was nothing, Mrs Lee told WSOCTV.

'I don't think they would've known about it if I didn't proceed with caution to see what's going on with my daughter.' 

Releasing the footage, she hopes to prompt the school board into punishing the perpetrators.

Call for action: Nikki Lee has released the video in a bid to provoke action from the school board

The school claims they are working to identify the attackers and the person that filmed the attack

She took the case to the school's dean the day after the incident but the children were not immediately suspended or questioned. 

'I don't think they acted fast enough,' Mrs Lee said. 

'The kids were still allowed to be in school that day.' 

In a statement, the district said the students 'are being disciplined according to the Code of Conduct. A full investigation is underway to identify additional participants and the person(s) videotaping.'

The school added that the perpetrators were taken back to the school after the attack.
