All eyes will be on Mauricio Pochettino when Tottenham take on his former club Southampton this weekend - not that successor Ronald Koeman is paying much attention to that reunion at White Hart Lane.

Having controversially replaced popular manager Nigel Adkins in January 2013, the former Argentina international was quick to win around not only the fans but admirers from afar.

Saints' swashbuckling, high-pressing style earned plenty of plaudits and last season saw them enjoy their best-ever Barclays Premier League campaign.

That success came at a cost, though, as a host of key players were poached in the wake of Pochettino and his staff moving to Tottenham in the summer.

Odds on relegation were dramatically cut but Koeman's men have so far confounded the nay-sayers, as they start the weekend second in the standings on a run of six successive wins in all competitions.

A seventh at the expense of Pochettino's side would be extra special for many connected with the club, although Koeman is not concerning himself with the background noise.

'For me [it does] not [give this game extra spice] because I wasn't here last season, but I understand for Mauricio Pochettino maybe it's special,' the Dutchman said. 'I think it's special for him and maybe for some players.

'We changed a lot this season our squad but it's always special for some players who worked with Mauricio last season.

'But there is no influence in the final result because the most important thing is to win the game or lose the game.'

While there have been numerous changes at St Mary's, Pochettino will be coming up against several familiar faces.

That core of players has helped Southampton's plethora of new arrivals adapt, providing Koeman with a good foundation from which to build.

'Every manager has his own way of working but from the first day of this season what I saw was a great spirit in the team, and I heard that was one of the qualities of last season,' the Dutchman said.

'The team and the players are continuing with that.

'Okay, it was difficult because we had a lot of changes but we had good scouting in the club and we bought good players in and maybe the challenge now is higher than the last season.

'Everybody was surprised with the eighth position last season, but people love how the team is doing and we will do everything to keep that. Last season is the past and we have to look forward.'

The determination to keep improving has not only impressed Koeman but a number of international managers, too.

Saints captain Jose Fonte was called up by Portugal for the first time on Friday, following on from Nathaniel Clyne's selection by England the previous day.

The right-back has played a key role in Southampton's fine start to the campaign and Koeman rates as one of the best he has coached in the position.

'I think everybody is agreed with that call because he's doing a fantastic job and he's still 23 years old and still a young player,' Koeman said.

'He has had a great progression this season and is playing very good for the team.

'He's one of the best in his position because he's defending good and he's fast and he shows his physical side.

'In the last minute against QPR, he made a run about 60 or 70 metres and that showed his spirit for the team and he's a very good player.'
