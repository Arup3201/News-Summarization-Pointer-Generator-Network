The lawyer representing the family of Rebecca Zahau, who was found hanging naked at Jonah Shacknai's mansion, is in talks over a book on the high-profile case.

Miss Zahau, 32, was found dead two days after her Mr Shacknai's six-year-old son, Max toppled over a balcony railing at the top of a staircase at the San Diego home. He died later that week from head injuries. 

Lawyer Anne Bremner has been hired by the Zahau family to spearhead efforts to get the investigation reopened after it was controversially ruled that Miss Zahau, who was found nude with her wrists tied on July 13, committed suicide.

Ms Bremner, who has a history of adapting her high profile cases into books, has been in recent talks with a literary agent and a crime author, according to a report by ABC News.

Ann Rule, the author of 32 non-fiction 
books about homicide and other crimes, told ABC News that she 
recently met with Ms Bremner and discussed the 
possibility of writing a book about the Zahau family..

Ms Rule said: 'The probability of writing a book about the Zahaus, however, is about 
'50/50 -– if charges were brought. It's a difficult thing 
because the little boy's father is very, very wealthy so for legal 
reasons it's kind of a mine field.'

Ms Bremner said she is 'a huge fan' of Ms Rule, adding, 'I believe Ann can help us find the answers that we seek.'

The Zahua family and Ms Bremner have established two websites about Miss Zahau, one of which asks for donations and is overseen by literary manager Sharlene Martin of Martin Literary Management in Seattle.

In a tweet on October 28 she wrote, 'Been working with Anne Bremner on the Rebecca Zahau case for 2 months. Help us find the truth athttp://www.RebeccaZahauFund.com PLEASE!'

Ms Martin told ABC News there is no Zahau book currently in the works, but if there was her agency would handle it.

For sale: Spreckels mansion owned by Jonah Shacknai is up for sale after his girlfriend and son both died at the San Diego property

Pharmaceuticals tycoon Mr Shacknai, 54, who has kept a low profile since the deaths, refused to comment on plans for a book.

The news comes after it emerged that Mr Shacknai has sold his lavish mansion where both his girlfriend was found dead.

The Spreckels mansion was sold to an investment group for an undisclosed amount but they plan to put the home on the market later this week for $14.5 million, according to RadarOnline.

Real estate agent Scott Aurich told 
the Coronado Patch that Mr Shacknai had originally bought the house for 
$13 million but the value dropped to $7 million.

Speaking of Mr Shacknai, the agent said: 'He's done.'

Miss Zahau's family had her body exhumed
last week, allegedly paid for by TV star and psychologist Dr Phil 
McGraw, to look for further evidence of foul play.

The forensic pathologist who conducted the second autopsy said coroners 'rushed to judgement' on ruling the death of Rebecca Zahau a suicide.

Senior forensic pathologist Dr Cyril Wecht has called those results into question - giving the Zahaus fresh hope the investigation into her

Although authorities closed the case into Miss Zahau's death, they have said if new evidence comes to light they will reopen it.

The Zahau family plans to discuss the findings with Dr Wecht on Dr Phil this month during sweeps week, reports the network.

Miss Zahau's sister, Snowem Horwath, told ABC News the family paid for the exhumation, which can cost up to $10,000 'through the generosity of others'; she said that Dr Wecht donated his services.

Miss Zahau's death came two days after Mr Shacknai's son, Max, was found unconscious at the base of the stairs at his father's vacation home in California.

However, questions have been raised about that ruling as well. 

The boy's physician, Dr Brad Peterson of Rady’s Children’s Hospital, was quoted in a search warrant saying suffocation may have occurred prior his fall.

His neck was broken and he was found not breathing and with no pulse by Miss Zahau at the bottom of the stairs after she heard a noise and came to look.

Miss Zahau and her teenage sister Xena were the only people at home at the time of Max's accident.

Police contend that Rebecca was in the bathroom at the time of Max's accident, and that Xena was in the shower.

Mr Shacknai has two children with his first wife, Kimberly. Max was his only child with his second wife, Dina, whom he divorced in 2008.
