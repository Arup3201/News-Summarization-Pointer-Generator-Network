A rogue European eagle owl is causing terror in a Dutch town after launching a series of swooping attacks which have left many locals requiring hospital treatment. 

Residents of Purmerend have been advised to arm themselves with umbrellas when going out at night after a mysterious spate of bloody owl assaults over the last three weeks.

The disconcerting news follows similar stories this week about Synwell, another European eagle owl, who routinely terrorizes residents of Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire and recently broke a 70-year-old woman's arm.

His Dutch cousin launched an aerial assault at an athletics club on Tuesday evening, which left one person requiring stitches for six head wounds caused by the nocturnal bird of prey's talons.

The club in Purmerend, northern Holland, has cancelled all training until further notice.

Residents and workers at the nearby Prinsenstichting home for the handicapped have been left terrified following at least 15 attacks, according to the home's spokesman Liselotte de Bruijn.

She said: 'During the day there's no problem, but at night we now only venture outside armed with umbrellas, helmets and hats, anything really, to protect ourselves.

'The problem is that you don't hear the owl before it strikes. Its claws are razor-sharp. We hope the city will soon catch this rogue bird.'

Purmerend city council said it was trying to find a solution, adding: 'We want to catch the owl as our city's residents are in danger.' 

On its website it noted  however that the European eagle owl is a protected species that requires special permission to be trapped.

'These procedures can still take some time. Meanwhile, we are advising people to stay away from the owl,' the city said, telling night strollers in the area to shield themselves with umbrellas.

Gejo Wassink of the Netherlands' OWN owl foundation said the female bird's behaviour was unusual.

He said: 'Either the owl was reared in captivity and released into the wild and now associates humans with food - meaning it's not really 'attacking' people.

'Or it may have heightened hormone levels as the breeding season starts, which influences its behaviour and makes it defend its territory.' 

He pointed to the wider problem of people hand-rearing owls and then releasing them into the wild when they become too big to handle, potentially leading to an increase in attacks.

The European eagle owl is one of the largest owl species, with a wing-span of around six feet and weighing up to 4kgs.

In Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, another of the breed, Synwell, has been terrorizing residents and recently broke a pensioner's arm.

Sue Dunn, 70, a retired nurse, ended up with the injury after she caught sight of Synwell’s enormous orange eyes one night and tried to photograph him perched on a lamppost, hooting.

Length: (65-70cm/26-28in). 

Wingspan: (160-190cm/5ft3-5ft11).

Weight: Up to 4kgs. 

Habitat: Mountain cliffs, ravines and rocky forested terrain (Europe and Russia).

Breeding: 2-3 eggs from February to May. 32-35 day incubation

Prey: Rabbit, hares, game birds, foxes, young roe deer and other birds of prey.

The largest prey recorded being taken is a roe deer weighing 13kg.

UK numbers:  Extinct in UK since 19th century. Recent reappearance may be a result of escaped captive birds.

‘He was making such a noise, so I went outside and shone my torch on him to try to get a picture,’ she said. 

‘He didn’t seem to like that. He drew his wings up and took off – flying straight at me.’

She tried to run back to her house but while dodging the bird, which stands over 2ft tall and weighs as much as a small dog, she tripped and fractured her right forearm as she broke her fall.

‘If he was being romantic, he should have gone to Specsavers. I had no time to run from him, he just dive-bombed me. He’s certainly got no fear of humans,’ she said.

It is the latest in a series of incidents in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, involving Synwell, who was named after an area of the town by locals.

Despite his misadventures, the bird has become so popular since he took up residence two years ago that residents have created a Facebook page for him to record sightings, incidents and photographs – and he has amassed 457 followers.
