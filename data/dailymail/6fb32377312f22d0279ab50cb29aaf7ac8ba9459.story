New research by Hobart's only men's shelter revealed that chronically homeless men have a lower life expectancy than those living in the slums of Africa.

The shelter found that the average lifespan of 41 men who stayed at there for over a decade was 48.

This is four years less than the average life expectancy in Africa according to the World Health Organization.

Chronically homeless men in Australia are thought to have much shorter lifespan a caseworker from a Hobart men's shelter revealed

The research from Bethlehem House, was presented on Friday at the National Homeless Conference in Brisbane.

Jeff Bendall, a caseworker from the shelter presented the case said that the main reason behind the low age of death was due to health issues homeless people face.

'A lot of these guys sleep rough every night in the cold. Therefore the body's working very hard to try to maintain the heat,' he told ABC News.

The stark reality of living on the streets: 67 per cent of homeless men live 'rough' or on the streets

'Also drug and alcohol, they have kidney problems, you've also got smoking.

But this radical statistic isn't just in Tasmania, similar life expectancies have been found throughout Australia.

'For men who experience chronic homelessness across Australia, the average life expectancy is between about 45 and 47 years of age, which is an alarmingly young age for men in a country as wealthy as ours to die," said Glenda Steven CEO of Homelessness Australia.

The organisation, Homeless Australia reports that over 105,000 people in Australia are homeless

'The average life expectancy for a man living in Somalia is actually 48.86 years.'So if you're a man in Somalia, you can expect to live longer than a man experiencing chronic homelessness in Australia.'

The figures have only been recorded by particular homeless shelters, there is no nationwide figure for lifespan of homeless men.

Homeless Australia revealed that 67.6 per cent of homeless men are sleeping 'rough' or on the streets while a much smaller 32.4 per cent of women do the same.

They also reported that there is approximately 105,237 homeless people in Australia.
