The range includes animal and graphic print two pieces with beaded embellishment.

One bold red number has super-sexy Baywatch appeal with a plunging neckline. It also comes in black and features plaited piping detail.

With sunbathers in mind, many of the items are halter-necked or stapless to prevent unsightly tan lines.

who will turn one in May, she's also begun creating a children's range 
and nursery collection for Littlewoods.

collections for Littlewoods is an absolute dream.'

On Wednesday WAG Coleen was beside the river Thames to help promote her swimwear range.

At least the sun shone to add a summer vibe to the photoshoot for Littlewoods aboard a boat opposite the London Eye.

Coleen wore a maroon and black stripe summer dress from the High Street store, who she has collaborated with as a designer since 2010.

She was joined by a number of models who showcased bikinis and sarongs from her summer swimwear collection.
