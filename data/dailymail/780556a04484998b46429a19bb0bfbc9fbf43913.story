When the leader of a Cuban spy ring serving life in a California federal prison was released by the US and met by his emotional wife at Havana airport there was one major question - how was she heavily pregnant?

Speculation about the baby's paternity was rife - some people even questioned whether Gerardo Hernandez had been allowed a secret conjugal meeting with his wife Adriana Perez - even she was banned from visits because she worked for the Cuban Intelligence Directorate

But it has now been revealed that Perez in fact became pregnant through artificial insemination.

The deal was brokered by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt, in exchange for better conditions for Alan Gross, the U.S. contractor imprisoned in Cuba, who released last week.

Today it was revealed that in February 2014, Leahy traveled to Cuba to help improve relations.

Hernandez's wife found out and asked to meet with Leahy - she asked for a chance to have a  child with her prisoner husband who had been in prison since 2001.

'The expectation was that this man would die in prison. This was her only chance of having a child,' Tim Rieser, an aide to Leahy told CNN.

'She was probably 42 or 43 and she had no expectation her husband was ever getting out prison - he was serving two consecutive life sentences - and she was desperate to have a child, knowing she was almost out of time,' Tim Rieser, an aide to Leahy told NBC. 

When Gerardo Hernandez was met by his wife last week at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport onlookers were puzzled about why she was heavily pregnant

Cuba paid for Hernandez's sperm to be collected and then flown to Cuba for the procedure- it worked the second time

Conjugal meetings were not on the cards, but Leahy worked with the State Department and the Bureau of Prisons to facilitate artificial insemination in return for better conditions for Alan Gross.

'They understood that the Senator's purpose was purely humanitarian,' Rieser said of administration officials who helped to NBC. 

Cuba paid for Hernandez's sperm to be collected and flown out of the country to Cuba.

All of this happened as both countries refused to admit that they were even holding negotiations,

The first attempt failed, but Perez became pregnant on the second try - the girl is due to arrive nexr month and they will name her Gema.

But even after Perez showed up at the airport, heavily pregnant, Hernandez was coy.

CNN reports he told a government-run television channel: 'Everyone's asking, and we have had a lot of fun with the comments and speculations.

'The reality is it had to be kept quiet. We can't give a lot of details, because we don't want to hurt people who meant well.' 

'To me, it's incredible,' said Maggie Khuly, (left) sister of Armando Alejandre Jr who died in 1996 shootdown .'I no longer know what to think of my government. People in Cuban jails are not allowed visits, are in horrible conditions, and here we are going way overboard so that this guy has a child? It doesn't make any sense'

'One of the first things accomplished by this process was this,' Hernandez said, gesturing to his Perez's stomach.

'I had to do it by 'remote control,' but everything turned out well.' 

Hernandez,  was one of the 'Five Heroes,' as they are known in Cuba - they are fixtures in state media and their faces grace billboards across the island. 

Schoolchildren are taught their names and take part in public acts demanding their release. 

However the five are reviled as spies by many exiles in South Florida.

Hernandez, had been serving two life sentences plus 15 years on a murder conspiracy conviction stemming from the Cuban air force's 1996 shoot-down of two planes flown by Brothers to the Rescue, an exile organization that sought to aid migrants at sea and also dropped propaganda leaflets.

Hernandez was convicted of providing Cuban authorities with information about the flight, which he has always denied, maintaining it was public knowledge. 

The sister of one of the four men killed in the shootdown blasted the news to NBC.

'To me, it's incredible,' said Maggie Khuly, sister of Armando Alejandre Jr. 

'I no longer know what to think of my government. People in Cuban jails are not allowed visits, are in horrible conditions, and here we are going way overboard so that this guy has a child? It doesn't make any sense.'

The news of Hernandez's release had already caused fury. 

Marlene Alejandre Triana, whose father Armando Alejandre Jr. was killed, said: 'My three daughters will never meet my father,' said Triana, whose father came to the U.S. as a child and volunteered for the Marines when he turned 18.

'For the only person that we had responsible for what happened to be let go, it's a slap in the face to my dad,' she said during a news conference in Coral Gables. 

In 2001 a US court ruled prisoners can send their semen to artificially inseminate their wives. 

In 1999, William Reno Gerber sued the California Department of Corrections - he claimed claimed his civil rights were violated when prison officials refused to let him send a semen specimen to a Chicago medical center to artificially inseminate his wife.

But, Gerber, 41, who is serving a prison sentence of 111 years, was eventually allowed to send the sample to his 46-year-old wife.
