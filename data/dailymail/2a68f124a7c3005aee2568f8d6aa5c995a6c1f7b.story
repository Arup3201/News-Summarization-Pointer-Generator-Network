Newtown Square, PA has some conscientious residents. Meet inky.
 Inky is no ordinary pooch. The
6-month-old poodle likes to lend a paw by holding the door open for his older
brother Scooby who is 14-years-old.

Maureen Gilronan posted the adorable video on Youtube so
that everyone could see how chivalrous her dog is.

The video shows Scooby making his way towards the door. As
soon as Maureen can say, ‘let him in,’ Inky is up on his feet pushing open the
door.

Scooby doesn’t make it through the first time but inky keeps
holding the door open. At one point Inky enthusiastically gestures with his paw
for Scooby to walk through.

Scooby finally makes it through and Maureen rewards him by
saying, ‘good job, Inky. Thank you.’

The video is so adorable that Maureen and her son Gavin were on 'Good Day Philadelphia' on Monday along with Inky and Scooby after sending their video to the network.

Maureen tells reporters that, 'Inky is obsessed with Scooby.' Inky first started opening doors because he was so excited to see his brother. Scooby on the other hand is more interested in sleeping.
