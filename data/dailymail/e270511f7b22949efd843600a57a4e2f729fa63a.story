Deco is part of an elite group of players to have won the Champions League twice - with Jose Mourinho's Porto in 2004 and with Barcelona in 2006.

The Portuguese also played in Europe's elite club competition with Chelsea, playing a total of 103 matches in Europe and scoring 19 goals.

Looking back over his career, the playmaker here selects his dream team of leading players to have graced the Champions League.

Goalkeeper

Manuel Neuer

When I was playing in Europe he was not so well known, but he has turned into the best I have ever seen. His performances for both Germany and Bayern are exceptional.

Defenders

Carles Puyol

Was such a leader for Barcelona. That is not to take anything away from his ability as a defender, but he was as important in the dressing room as he was on the field.

John Terry

Very similar to how Puyol was for Barcelona, John was the leader of Chelsea and is still doing it now. When he does decide to retire, he will be so hard for Chelsea to replace.

Ricardo Carvalho

One of my best moments is winning the Champions League with him, then it was great to play with him again all those years later at Chelsea. Without doubt he is the classiest defender I have ever played with.

Midfield

Diego Simeone

Diego Simeone was a really tough competitor; he would always let you know he was there. He wasn’t just tough though, he had a really excellent range of passing.

Paul Scholes

It is not coincidence so many professionals talk so highly of Paul Scholes. Of course he is one of the best midfield players of my Champions League, but also I think you can call him one of the best midfield players in the history of the game.

Xavi

At the peak of Barcelona he was at the centre of everything that was good about Barcelona. Maybe the other players got more headlines, but Xavi was the catalyst for it all.

Zinedine Zidane

The one player of my generation I wish I could have played with. Just a fantastic player in every single way.

Attack

Lionel Messi

Messi is a natural born talent, that is not to say he doesn’t work hard, but you can’t teach what he can do him and Ronaldo are actually I think very different, but at the moment they are the two best in the world.

Cristiano Ronaldo

What a lot of people don’t see is just how hard Ronaldo has worked to get where he is, he is the ultimate professional. Of course he has natural ability, but not many people know how hard he has worked to be voted the best player in the world.

Ronaldinho

I always remember when we (Barcelona) would go two or three goals up, and Ronny would start to enjoy himself. He done things that you just think are not possible with a football, he is the best I have ever played with.
