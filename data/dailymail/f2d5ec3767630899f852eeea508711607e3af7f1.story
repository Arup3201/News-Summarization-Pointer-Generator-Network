A woman whose tenacity and sexually charged savvy famously helped win millions in damages for a chemical-leak plagued small town will now seek justice for the 300,000 West Virginians whose tap water was poisoned Thursday thanks to what appears to be a chemical company's shoddy safety practices.

Erin Brockovich announced on her personal website Friday that she and her team are headed to Charleston, West Virginia to investigate the cause and possible implications of the 750,000 gallons of a coal processing chemical that spilled into the region's water supply from a leaking tank at Freedom Industries.

'You have to find out what’s going on,' declared the gutsy blond who became a household name when Julia Roberts played her in a 2000 Hollywood film.

Famous name: Erin Brockovich, who famously helped the illness-plagued town of Hinkley, California win some $300,000,000 after a chemical company poisoned their drinking water announced she'll step in to lend her expertise 300,000 West Virginians' fight for justice

No ally: As 300,000 residents in and around Charleston, West Virginia suffer without water safe to drink or even bath in, a banner name in safe water and environmental advocacy has joined their cause

It's an imperative that may not be easily met: as federal and state officials scramble to uncover who's to blame for the disaster, a complex hierarchy of ownership of the plant in question starts at small town Freedom itself and slithers upward to the likes of Koch Industries.

Thursday's tragedy began with a smell: residents of Charleston, West Virginia began to complain of a licorice-like aroma in the air, one that seemed most potent near the town's water treatment plant.

For an unknown period, a chemical called 4-methylcyclohexane methanol used in the Mountain State's prevalent coal industry had been gushing into the Elk River, a waterway from which West Virginia's largest water treatment plant sources its water.

Beware: More than 300,000 people have been told to indefinitely avoid drinking or even touching tap water following Thursday's chemical spill in Charleston, West Virgina

Amazing life: Brockovich (right) became a household name after Julia Roberts (left) portrayed her in 2000's Erin Brockovich, for which the Roberts won a best actress Oscar. After Brocovich's $300,000,000 victory against the chemical company responsible for sickening countless residents of Hinkley, Calilfornia, she has continued her fight by helping other communities

Panicked officials warned residents in nine counties to immediately and indefinitely stop using their tap water and to not even touch it.

As West Virginians swarmed stores to purchase bottled water they had no clue when they might get their water back because officials--some seemingly clueless and others unwilling to say what they may or may not know about the leak--remained mum on a cleanup time-frame.

The unanswered questions greatly outweighed the answers.

'I can't tell you that the water is unsafe, but I also can't tell you that the water is safe,'was West Virginia Water president Jeff McIntyre beguiling answer to reporters eager to know the dangers of the spill at a Friday press conference.

Torn community: Bonnie Wireman of Dry Branch, West Virginia talks about how the ban on using tap water for drinking and washing has detrimentally effected her and her family Sunday. The coal miner widow made clear that she did not blame the coal or chemical industries for the spill

Necessary for life: Bonnie Wireman of Dry Branch has to cover her faucets in bags as a reminder that she cannot use the tap water in her home because of Thursday's spill

It left people, especially those unable to leave the affected area--the poor, the disabled, the elderly--terrified.

It's just that sort of scenario that catches the attentions of the famed environmental crusader and her investigative team.

'When things like this happen, we respond accordingly,' Brockovich told The West Virginia Record.
 'People have contacted us who are concerned, and it’s certainly a 
scenario that concerns us. I mean, there are 300,000 people without 
water right now.'

'The emergency now is getting the back-up plan and getting water to these people and businesses.

'Then,
 we can look at damages. We don’t know any of the answer to this right 
now. I mean, what didn’t we learn from the BP spill or the Tennessee 
Valley Authority spill. What have we not learned?

'We
 have to start looking at the question of, "Are we forcing an issue 
where speed, greed and money are more important than safety?"'

After
 fixing the immediate problem of finding drinking water, Brockovich said
 it must be determine what lasting affects West Virginia's leak will 
have on its children, ecosystem and wildlife.

It's
 the same process she took beginning in 1993 when she began her quest in
 Hinkley, California where Pacific Gas and Electric helped sicken an 
entire town following a serious and subsequently concealed release of 
dangerous Chromium 6 into the town well water.

The
 detrimental health effects of chromium 6 are well studied, however the 
compound the poured into the West Virginia river last week is not nearly
 as well understood, especially at the extreme levels released during 
the leak.

Dire need: Employees of the South Charleston Public Works Department help local residents to obtain water as officials remained mum as to win the tap water would become safe again

Workers at Freedom Industries continued through the night to empty storage tanks of chemicals into tanker trucks at it's plant in Charleston, West Virginia on Sunday, days after it dumped 7,500 gallons of a toxic chemical into the river where 300,000 residents in the area get their water

At least it's not lethal: While considered 'not lethal' 4-methylcyclohexane methanol is harmful if swallowed and can cause nausea, irritation, and headaches

Poison control experts won't categorize 4-methylcyclohexane methanol as lethal but will only refer to the chemical as 'harmful if swallowed.'

The substance is considered dangerous to touch, hence the warnings not to bathe in city water.

The chemical may also be harmful when airborne, but quickly dissipates in air, where it produces a licorice smell.

It will take days for the substance in the water to break down and far longer for it to break down in the soil surrounding the river.

The chemical's concentration in the local water supply was lower Friday, but not to the point officials felt safe allowing people to drink the water again - and Charleston's mayor didn't mince words in voicing his displeasure.

'It's caused us more problems than you could ever imagine,' he told CNN. 'It's a prison from which we would like to be released.'

The ban has forced schools, offices, restaurants, hotels and other businesses to shutter, but hospitals have remained busy.

Once the residents of West Virginia are safe again, Brockovich--who helped the residents of Hinkley win a reported $333,000,000 settlement against Pacific Gas and Electric in California--says the next step in West Virginia is obvious.

'When that is all resolved, it’s safe to say law firms are going to come in and look at everything. I saw today that six lawsuits already have been filed. We knew that was going to happen, of course.'
