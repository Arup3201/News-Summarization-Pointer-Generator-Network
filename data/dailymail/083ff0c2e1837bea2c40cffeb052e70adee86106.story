A 16-year-old schoolgirl who was apparently a victim of bullying posted a Facebook message asking her friends if anyone would cry if she died - just hours before committing suicide, it today emerged.

Amber Cornwell posted the chilling words, 'If I die tonight, would anyone cry?', on the social network site while sitting in her bedroom in Henderson County, North Carolina, on December 21.

The following morning, the East Henderson High School student was found hanged in her closet by her distraught parents, Kim and Alan Cornwell. Tragically, she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Now, Amber's friends and family have claimed bullying was responsible for the death of the teen, who had returned home in a 'happy' mood after a date with her new boyfriend just hours earlier.

'They [the bullies] were really mean, they’d say stuff to her face, behind her back,' one of the student's friends, Stephanie Hernandez, told ABC 13. 'They’d message her on Facebook.'

Another friend, Sierra Crochet, added: 'I’ve been crying for days now. They were just calling her names. And called her names and said she had no future and had nothing going for her.'

Mrs Cornwell said Amber - an honor roll student, a tennis player and a member of the All County Chorus - had been targeted by bullies since the sixth grade, but she thought it had died down.

'The boys like her and the girls hate her, and that's not fair' she said through tears. 'All the time, it was always something. We thought it had calmed down.

'She put something on Facebook, that said, "if I die tonight, would anyone cry?" I want her to know, yeah I'm crying. My heart is broken.'

Speaking to the network, she added that Amber's boyfriend had been shocked to hear of his girlfriend's death after they had spent an enjoyable evening together.

In recent days, friends have set up a memorial page for Amber on Facebook, called RIP Amber Cornwell, on which others have condemned school bullying as the motive for the teenager's suicide.

Christine Erman wrote: 'How could kids be so heartless. This breaks my heart because she is very beautiful and seems like she had a bright future ahead of her.'

Meanwhile, James Sain said: 'Singing and dancing with The Lord.. Amber, U will never be forgotten and always in our hearts. Love you beautiful young lady.'

A candlelight vigil was held in Amber's honor at East Henderson High on Saturday evening. School officials have not yet commented on the claims that bullying was responsible for Amber's death.

The teenager's family, who laid their daughter to rest on Boxing Day, hope that speaking about her death will help to prevent a similar tragedy in the future.

'I don't want another child to die because of name calling,' said Mrs Cornwell.
