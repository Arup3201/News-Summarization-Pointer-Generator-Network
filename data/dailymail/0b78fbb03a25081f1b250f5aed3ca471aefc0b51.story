Northern Irish co-driver Allan Harryman had a narrow escape at the Jordan Rally, with his car precariously perched, Italian Job-style, on a cliff face for a nerve-jangling 20 minutes.

Driver Mohammed al-Sahlawi fell foul of the tough terrain, with the Citroen DS3 R3 2WD miraculously coming to a halt before a 20 foot drop.

Harryman took to Twitter to tell of his exploits, saying: 'We'd been hanging around a while there, cos my window is open! Glad we didnt try to get out!'

'Sat there for 20 mins #italianjob style until a fella with a winch arrived...'

Miracle escape: Drivers Mohammed al-Sahlawi and Allan Harryman are on the brink of a terrifying 20ft plunge as their rally car hangs over the edge of a cliff after going off-piste during the Jordan Rally

Precarious: Incredibly, the vehicle came to a halt and was heaved to safety by race marshals and spectators, with the drivers escaping unhurt

Al-Sahlawi said: 'It was a blind corner and I was worried about it so I was slowing down.

'But
 everyone had been cutting from the left and there weren't any lines to 
follow. I stopped when I saw the water but the front right wheel went 
over the edge and we got stuck.

'We just waited for someone to pull us back. We were scared we might fall off.'

Not so lucky: Later in the day, another car fell foul of the course and did fall off the edge, causing Majed Al Shamsi a shoulder injury

Another pair of drivers weren't so lucky later in the day, though, after their car did take the plunge after sliding off the road at the same point.

It fell 20ft and landed on its roof and one of the drivers, Majed al-Shamsi, was taken to a clinic with his shoulder in a sling.

Despite the mishap, Irish co-driver John Higgins said: 'We're both fine.We came to a loose sharp left with a big drop, and the back wheels went over the edge. The car just fell back over the edge and landed upside down.'
