The days of being caught short at the till after forgetting your wallet could soon become a thing of the past.

The brains behind this biometric terminal, which allows shoppers to pay for their wares using just their fingerprints, claim their machine is attracting interest from retailers across the globe.

Paytouch users link their credit card details to their fingerprints, letting them spend to their hearts' content without the need for PIN numbers, signatures, or even the card itself.

Customers simply press two 
fingers on to a glass screen on the terminal to pay via their linked 
credit or debit card, doing away with the need to carry a card that 
could be lost, skimmed or stolen.

The fingerprint recognition system provides 'faultless identity verification', says the Spanish start-up.

According
to Paytouch its terminals are equipped with capacitive biometric 
sensors to prevent the use of fake fingers.

Secure: The touchscreens could soon be added to existing payment terminals that require a PIN or credit card swipe

The gadget was introduced at the Ushua√Øa Ibiza Beach Hotel on the Balearic party island last year, and the technology is already attracting international interest.

Biometrics refers to methods used to identify humans based upon one or more intrinsic physical or behavioural traits.

In information technology it is used as a form of identity access management and access control.

Humans' biometric characteristics can be divided into two main categories:

In the short-term the firm is hoping to launch Paytouch terminals in supermarkets and petrol stations across Spain, before branching out into other European countries and the U.S.

Shoppers could also see the technology cropping up on payment terminals that require a credit card swipe or PIN code, as the firm has been fielding requests from customers who want to see the biometric aspect integrated into their existing machines.

CEO Javier Paso told Engadget.com: 'We're hoping to have more deals in place by the end of the year.'

But he added that there was likely to be a pause in activity as Paytouch prepares for large scale expansion.

'...We need additional funding for additional infrastructure so we can assure excellent service,' he said.

Paytouch is looking to open four more offices across Europe and the U.S. in the next 12 months.

Biometric authentication identifies humans using their physical traits or behavioural characteristics.

The analysis of fingerprints for 
matching purposes generally requires the comparison of several features 
of the print pattern, along with the structure and property of human skin.
