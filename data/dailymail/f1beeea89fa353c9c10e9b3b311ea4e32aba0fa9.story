She rose to fame as the resident 'Stepford psycho', Marnie, on 
HBO's hit show, Girls, and recently landed a beauty contract with Simple skincare and it seems that actress Allison Williams' star continues to rise.

And now the 24-year-old brunette has had another accolade handed to her: as a Duchess of Cambridge lookalike. 

The actress has recently spoken out about how people insist on telling her how much she looks like Kate - to the point where she has worked on perfecting her impression by starring in spoof sketches of the Royal.

Playing the part: Allison puts on her best British accent as the Duchess of Cambridge alongside British actor and model Oliver Jackson-Cohen

Lookalikes: Girls star Allison Williams says she regularly gets told she looks like the Duchess of Cambridge and has even starred in spoofs videos as the Royal

'I kept being told by people that I looked like her and then my friend said I should play her, so we put together some sketches for Funny Or Die.

'It's the first thing I've written, actually. I hope people find them funny while realising that I have great admiration for her,' she told The Metro.

In the tongue-in-cheek sketches, Allison can be seen sat in a makeshift throne alongside Prince William, played by British actor and model Oliver Jackson-Cohen.

Allison can be heard saying (in her best British accent): 'It's crazy, I've never seen it in this light. Do you guys think you can take the lights down on his head?'

A day in the life: The duo act out Kate and William's 'mundane' every day life

As she looks at William and says: 'You look like a globe. I had no idea he was this f****** bald.'

The crew then ask: 'Thanks for doing this guys, we just want to get a glimpse into your everyday lives.'

To which 'Kate' replies: 'Of course, I think our everyday lives are quite boring, don't you? It's quite mundane.'

Comedy: The sketch pokes fun at the Royals and 'Kate' can be heard saying that she will never ever eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

The couple can then be seen at home making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich which Kate describes as 'something I will never eat, ever' before they discuss how much they love Justin Bieber, Jersey Shore and 'ghetto' reality shows.

'People think because I'm a Prince, I can't be ghetto,' adds William.

The spoof video has been met by much acclaim with viewers posting about how funny it is.

Miss Williams' fame has exploded since season 2 of Girls began airing - but the star has hit the 
headlines for other reasons in recent weeks after being romantically 
linked to singer John Maye.

The two were when the pair were apparently seen enjoying a
night out together.

However,
according to sources, the actress is in fact dating Ricky Van Veen - a 
close friend of Mayer's who founded the CollegeHumor website while Mayer is still dating I Kissed A Girl singer Katy Perry.

The
source told the New York Daily News: 'Allison and her boyfriend Van 
Veen are good friends with John and Katy. Her boyfriend was with them 
for the entire evening.'
