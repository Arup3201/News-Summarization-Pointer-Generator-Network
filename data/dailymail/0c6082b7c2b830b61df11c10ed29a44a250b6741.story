Quit: John Randall resigned as deputy chief whip days after 'plebgate' files were given to police

A central figure in the ‘plebgate’ scandal that forced Andrew Mitchell out of the Cabinet resigned from the Government last night

John Randall dramatically quit as deputy chief whip, only days after files were given to the Crown Prosecution Service about his former boss, Mr Mitchell.

Mr Randall said he had wanted to return to the backbenches since the end of last year.

His departure came ahead of a so-called ‘flat cap’ reshuffle expected today or tomorrow, in which David Cameron will promote northern and working-class MPs.

Chloe Smith, the constitutional affairs minister, also resigned from the Government last night.

Mr Mitchell was forced to quit after he was accused of calling a police officer a ‘pleb’.

But CCTV footage of the  exchange at the gates of Number 10 – when he was asked by an officer to get off his bike – cast doubt on that claim.

In an exchange of letters with Number 10, Mr Randall praised his ‘fantastic colleagues’, notably Patrick [McLoughlin] and Sir George [Young] – but he left out any  mention of Mr Mitchell.

Mr Randall was widely credited with helping ease Mr Mitchell’s departure from government after threatening to quit if his boss remained in post.

But a return to the Cabinet is not expected for Mr Mitchell until the Prime Minister carries out a reshuffle at Cabinet level next spring after the European elections.

He will also want the police investigation into the plebgate row to conclude. Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, has also been touted as a contender for the chief whip role.

Government whips Karen Bradley and Nicky Morgan are expected to become ministers.

A source close to Mr Mitchell said: ‘It’s interesting isn’t it that the CPS have just taken possession of all the files.’ Mr Mitchell himself said: ‘I have no comment to make whatsoever.’

David Cameron moved last night to crush a bid to hold a referendum next year on leaving the EU.

Tory backbencher Adam Afriyie, who has been accused of plotting against Mr Cameron, announced plans for an amendment to legislation paving the way for a promised vote in 2017.

The Prime Minister has pledged to hold an in-out referendum after renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels if he wins the next election.

But Mr Afriyie – who is said to have 25 supporters lined up for a future leadership bid – claims the public is ‘not convinced’ the PM would stick to his promise.

He wants to give MPs the chance to vote for a referendum in 2014 when Tory James Wharton’s Government-backed Referendum Bill is debated on November 8.

Senior Tories accused him of seeking to ‘destabilise’ the Prime Minister ‘at any cost’. A No10 source said: ‘We will not allow this amendment to be passed.’

In a letter to Mr Cameron, Mr Randall wrote that he had been ‘very lucky to have you as my boss for the last eight years’. In an equally effusive letter, Mr Cameron said Mr Randall had been ‘a rock’.

‘It sounds dramatic, but I had rather hoped this day would never come,’ he wrote. ‘I could not have wished for a more loyal, discreet, patient, trustworthy and committed colleague over the last eight years.’

Miss Smith, the 31-year-old constitutional affairs minister and youngest member of the Government, also quit last night.

Her ascent was cut short after she was mauled by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight while serving as a Treasury minister.

Miss Smith officially ‘resigned’ from the Government but sources suggest that she was pushed because of a lacklustre performance.

More senior sources played down those claims, saying Miss Smith – who recently got married after proposing following a whirlwind four-month romance – had to concentrate on saving her marginal seat at the next election.

On Friday, Simon Burns quit as Transport Minister to launch a bid to be Commons Deputy Speaker. Kris Hopkins, the MP for Keighley in West Yorkshire, and Jane Ellison, who grew up in Bradford, are both tipped for ministerial office.

Sajid Javid, who was born in Rochdale, is expected to be promoted from his junior Treasury post to the ranks of Ministers of State, one below the Cabinet.
