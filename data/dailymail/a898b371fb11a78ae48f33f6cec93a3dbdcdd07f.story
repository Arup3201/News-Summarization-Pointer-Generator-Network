German football legend Franz Beckenbauer was banned for 90 days from all football activity by FIFA on Friday night after failing to co-operate with the inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

Such a crackdown on one of the world’s best known figures in football, a World Cup winning player and coach and the force behind the 2006 World Cup in Germany, is the strongest possible sign that New York lawyer Michael Garcia means business with his investigation.

Garcia had warned of severe penalties at the FIFA Congress this week for those who had purposely avoided being interviewed by his team and Beckenbauer, the most high profile of the refuseniks, is the first to be punished.

'I really do not know why," Beckenbauer told Sky Television in Germany, when asked why he had been banned. 'First thing I did was look at the date as I thought it was an April Fool's joke.'

'I am the Bayern Munich honorary president. Even if I cannot do this for 90 days it is something the honorary president can survive.'

Beckenbauer surprisingly stepped down 
from the FIFA ExCo after being part of the committee who voted to give 
the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 edition to Qatar with the 
Qatari bid mired in allegations of vote buying.

A
 FIFA statement said: ‘The apparent breach relates to Mr Beckenabauer’s 
failure to co-operate with an Ethics Committee investigation despite 
repeated requests for his assistance.’

There
 has been speculation that Garcia, who is due to deliver his report to 
FIFA after the World Cup, had discovered some wrongdoing connected with 
all bidding countries and would not single one out in his findings.

But
 the decision to discipline Beckenbauer suggests that Garcia will not be
 afraid to recommend severe punishment – even a revote – if he finds 
sufficient evidence.

In 
an exclusive interview with Sportsmail’s Jeff Powell earlier this month,
 Beckenbauer had revealed that Garcia had sent him a questionnaire in 
English rather than German. Beckenbauer told Powell: ‘It contained some 
complex legal issues that I wasn’t comfortable about responding to in 
anything but German.’

Beckenbauer
 then went public last weeked with his reasons for swerving an interview
 with Garcia, who had sent him two letters, the second of which had 
angered the Kaiser.

Beckenbauer
 said: ‘I must say that I am seriously surprised about Mr Garcia’s 
approach. I am no longer actively involved in football and he has 
therefore no power whatsoever to interview me.

‘Fact
 is also that Mr Garcia, who is probably used to calling the shots, 
reacted unpleasantly to my response and tried the limits of my patience 
in his second missive, both in tone and content. I believe that the 
gentleman should try and understand that we like to maintain a certain 
form in Europe.’

He 
added: ‘Look everybody knows whose side I was on .The German Football 
Association had a gentlemen’s agreement with the Australian FA and this I
 had a mandate. I had made my views clear on several occasions.’

In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail's Jeff Powell earlier this month, Beckenbauer raised worrying doubts about the efficiency of the probe into the Qatar 2022 World Cup bribery allegations.

The German icon confirmed he was contacted by the commission led by lawyer Michael Garcia, who is due to report after the World Cup in Brazil.

Beckenbauer said: ‘They sent me a questionnaire but it was in English and it contained some complex legal issues. So I asked them to re-send it to me in German.

‘I have heard nothing from them since.’

The Kaiser is a good English speaker but added: ‘I wasn’t comfortable about responding to such technical questions in anything but German.’

Those most actively opposed to Qatar being awarded the 2022 Finals may not have welcome one answer Beckenbauer would have given.

Of the allegations that disgraced former FIFA executive Mohammad Bin Hamman paid cash for votes, Beckenbauer said: ‘As usual the ballot was secret.

‘I am not revealing which country I voted should host those Finals. Nor do I know who Bin Hamman voted for. We worked together on the FIFA executive for four years and I regarded him as a friend.

‘But I can assure that I was never approached about my vote, nor was I ever offered anything.

‘If any allegations of corruption are proved then there is an argument for a re-vote.

‘One benefit of the Qatar bid is that that in complying with FIFA’s requirements they are constructing 12 stadia. They don’t need 12 grounds near each other.

‘They only need one new stadium so they are constructing in a way that 11 of them can be taken down after the World Cup, sent to countries in need around the world, where they be reassembled.’

Beckenbauer is also on the record as saying the Qatar World Cup would have to be played in winter.
