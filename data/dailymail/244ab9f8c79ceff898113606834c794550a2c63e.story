What started as an April fool’s joke by an American brewery has resulted in the production of a rather unique new type of beer, made using bulls' testicles.

The Wynkoop Brewing Company in Denver produced a spoof video touting the daring ingredient in a fake product called Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout last April as a publicity stunt for April fool’s day.

Despite the video containing some fairly tongue-in-cheek lines it seems the joke was lost on many and the company was inundated with requests for samples of the special beer.

Turning a joke into reality: The beer is made of hops, gains, water and fresh bull's testicles

Farm fresh: The Rocky Mountain Oysters are added whole into the kettle to give the full 'flavour and nuances into the beer'

‘When we sent out the press release and the video link last April, we heard from brewers and beer writers who thought the beer was for real and loved the idea. They wanted samples. So did many patrons who came to the pub to try the beer. So we’ve turned our joke into a reality.’

The first eight barrels were made for the Great American Beer Festival, held in Denver later this month, and contains a massive 11kg of bull testicles, all lovingly sliced and roasted by Wynkoop sous chef Andrew Langlo.

The April fool’s video features head brewer Andy Brown praising the Wynkoop’s tradition of ‘trailblazing’ in the field and sourcing new ingredients, especially those with a ‘strong regional flavor.’

The magic ingredient: The testicles are from free range Colorado cattle and are described as 'really fresh'

A brewer then explains: ‘Fried bull testicles or Rocky Mountain Oysters are a Colorado favorite.

‘This
 makes them the perfect ingredient to showcase in a new style of beer 
we’ve created, which really pays tribute to one of Colorado’s unique 
culinary jewels.’

A voice over lists the ingredients as organic Colorado Malts, hops, Rocky Mountain water, and bull testicles from free range Colorado cattle.

‘We’re adding the Rocky Mountain Oysters whole into the kettle to give the full flavour and nuances into the beer

‘When making this style of beer it’s important to use the freshest ingredients possible, and these testicles… they’re very fresh.’

The result of our efforts is a luscious creamy stout that delivers loads of flavor, everything from roasted barley and coffee, to chocolate...and nuts’

The video ends by informing customers that there is a limit of two cans per head, presumably to prevent a wave of bulk buying on the part of enthusiastic, and daring, drinkers.
