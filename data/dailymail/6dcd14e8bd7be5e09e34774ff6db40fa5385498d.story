France's foreign minister has splashed out £70,000 of taxpayers cash on works of art by Renoir and Boldini for an exhibition next to his office.

Laurent Fabius made the decision to fork out for the masterpieces from the famous Musée d'Orsay at a time when the country's national debt is more than £1.3trillion.

The paintings are now on display in a room beside the minister at the Quai d'Orsay Foreign Office headquarters in Paris.

Despite being paid for with public money, only Mr Fabius and selected guests will be able to enjoy the masterpieces.

The revelation comes as France's President Francois Hollande aims to slash spending on government departments.

A french satirical newspaper which has poked fun at the irony of Mr Fabius's decision is said to have angered Mr Hollande who prides himself on living a normal life.

The socialist President was seen as the antidote to Nikolas Sarkozy when he took charge of the country earlier this year.

Sarkozy gained his extravagant reputation soon after coming to power when he was spotted holidaying as a guest of multi-millionaires and hanging out in glamorous restaurants.

The beautiful works of art are due to remain at the Quai d'Orsay until the end of the year, but only invited guests will get the chance to enjoy the work.

When the exhibition opened to the public for just two days this weekend, only a few people turned up as it was given little publicity.

The French Foreign Office revealed that £70,000 had been spent on preparations and security for the exhibition with £30,000 of that going on fittings and security measures for the priceless works.

A further £3,000 went on producing a souvenir brochure for guests.

According to the newspaper Le Canard Enchainé the remainder of the money was spent on 'unspecified items'.
