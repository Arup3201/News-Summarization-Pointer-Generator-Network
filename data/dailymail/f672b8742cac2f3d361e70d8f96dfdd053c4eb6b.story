A football club has been charged with race victimisation by the FA after it 'refused to pay medical bills' for an injured black striker.

Gillingham Football Club and its chairman Paul Scally have been charged over the dismissal of retired striker Mark McCammon after the football governing body judged its rules had been breached.

The former Barbados international player sued the club in August 2012 after being sacked the previous year amid claims he was treated differently because he was black.

He said staff victimised the club's black players and treated them differently to their white team mates.

McCammon, 36, claimed the League One club tried to 'frustrate him out' by refusing to pay private medical bills that would help him regain fitness following a serious injury.

The club offered the operation on the NHS rather than privately - a move he described as 'completely out of character' for a Football League club.

He was then fined two weeks' wages when he paid a visit to a private consultant.

McCammon claimed he was docked wages when he failed to turn up for training during heavy snow while some white players were told they were not required. He was subsequently dismissed from the club

However, the 6ft 2in striker said an injured white team-mate was flown to Dubai for treatment by an eminent physiotherapist at the club's expense.

McCammon also claimed he was docked wages when he failed to turn up for training during heavy snow when driving conditions were 'treacherous', while some white players were told they were not required.

The striker was subsequently ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing and later received a letter saying he was dismissed. 

McCammon, who signed for Gillingham for £2,500 a week in 2008, told an employment tribunal in 2012 he had been put 'through hell' and had not been given an answer over why he was treated differently to other players.

Dubai-based Gillingham chairman Paul Scally described McCammon's claims as being made 'maliciously and without foundation', adding that the club had not had to deal with an allegation of racism in 18 years.

The club lost an appeal last September and the original decision was upheld and they had to pay £68,000 compensation to McCammon, who also played for Doncaster Rovers and Millwall. 

Now the association say the club breached FA Rule E3 by failing to act in the best interests of the game, and/or bringing the game into disrepute by committing an act of race victimisation by dismissing Mark McCammon. 

Both Gillingham FC and Mr Scally have until November 14 to respond.
