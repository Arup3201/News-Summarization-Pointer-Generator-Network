After a very public break up played 
out in front of millions online, Kate and Ben Goldsmith finally called a
 truce on their war of words on Twitter.

But it was only so long before the rapper who came between them had his say.

As Mrs Goldsmith and Jay Electronica 
were photographed together for the first time yesterday, the American 
singer took to Twitter to finally tell the world just what he thought 
about the man whose wife he stole.

And it wasn’t flattering.

Jay Electronica's tweets to Ben Goldsmith

Electronica sent him messages on Twitter in which he referred to Mr Goldsmith as a ‘bitch’ and threatened to pay him a visit.

It is believed to be the first time the pair have communicated on the site.

After a period of quiet, Electronica 
reignited the feud last night, warning him to stop being ‘a f***ing 
hypocrite’ by telling his side of the story to the press.

At 6.20pm, Electronica wrote to 
@BJGoldsmith: ‘ben you need to stop going to the press w these b******t 
stories. Dont be a f***ing hypocrite. I’ll come see you.’

Twenty minutes later, he added: ‘you wanna go public, i’ll go public and you aint gonna like it. stop acting like a bitch’.

While there appears to be no love lost between the two men, Electronica and Mrs Goldsmith looked closer than ever yesterday.

Hours before the Twitter feud 
reignited, Mrs Goldsmith and the rapper were pictured in public for what
 is believed to be the first time.

The couple were seen leaving 
35-year-old Electronica’s £1.8million apartment in London and both 
appeared to have dressed down for the occasion.

relationship with a rapper

The Rothschild heiress covered her head with a hoodie while Electronica was in loose fitting sweat shorts.

After strolling from the hip hop 
artist’s base in Knightsbridge, the pair hailed a cab at a crossroads, 
with Electronica returning alone on foot a few hours later.

Until they declared a truce, the 
Goldsmiths had played out their bitter marital row on Twitter over Mrs 
Goldsmith’s alleged affair with the New Orleans born rapper, whose real 
name is Timothy Elpadaro Thedford.

Police arrested Mr Goldsmith, 31, 
youngest son of late billionaire Sir James Goldsmith, at the couple’s 
£20million home in Kensington earlier this month on suspicion of actual 
bodily harm.

It reportedly followed a confrontation
 between the Eton-educated financier, who inherited £300million after 
his father’s death, and his wife over explicit texts and emails between 
her and Electronica.

Mr Goldsmith was released without 
charge after accepting a caution and later announced he was filing for 
divorce on the grounds of adultery.

Row: Kate Rothschild had tweeted that hip-hop star Jay Electronica, pictured, had 'saved her life' after her husband branded her 'appalling' for her relationship with the musician

The incident led to a torrent of angry
 posts on Twitter from the couple, with Mr Goldsmith branding his wife 
‘appalling’ over her alleged affair.

In response, Mrs Goldsmith, who was 
left £18million after the suicide of her banker father Amschel 
Rothschild, posted 14 extraordinary messages defending her behaviour.

In them, the mother of three claimed 
her ‘life had been saved’ by the rapper, whom she manages through her 
label Roundtable Records, and appeared to accuse her husband of cheating
 on her.

Electronica grew up in one of the poor ‘projects’ areas of New Orleans.

He went to an all-boys Catholic 
school and briefly attended college before being kicked out for what he 
describes as doing ‘stupid s***’.

Back at home Electronica says he ‘started sniffing coke a little bit’ and ‘sold off a little weed’.

Before he met Mrs Rothschild, he 
already appeared to have an obsession with the banking dynasty. In one 
rap he talks about how success has meant ‘brunch with the Rothschilds’.

But in another, he appears to be more critical of the dynasty and raps about ‘blasting at the Rothschilds’.

It provoked an ugly war of words between the couple which culminated in the tweets by Mrs Goldsmith.

In 14 messages posted in quick 
succession, the music producer – who calls herself Kate Rothschild on 
Twitter – wrote: 'Our marriage went bad a few years ago and none of you 
have any idea what I went through along with my husband. My husband is a
 brilliant and incredible man... but relationships can go wrong. This is
 the darkest time of my life.'

In response to a Twitter user who 
wrote: 'Imagine if you'd been cheated on', she replied: 'I have, several
 times.' By yesterday morning all the messages had been deleted.

Electronica, 35, refused to comment. But a neighbour said: 'Jay is a perfect Southern gentleman. 
Kate is absolutely lovely. They are a lovely couple.'
