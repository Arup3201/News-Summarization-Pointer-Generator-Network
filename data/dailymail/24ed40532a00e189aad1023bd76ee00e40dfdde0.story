Leon Osman is in Claire House Children's Hospice painting with Jasmine Beedles but the 12-year-old has a dark secret she is worried about sharing; she is a Manchester United fan.

Her father is to blame she says and he wouldn't like her talking to an Everton player. Chirpy Jasmine has DiGeorge Syndrome which affects her heart and breathing. She and her family are regular visitors to the Wirral-based hospice that gives respite and care for children with life-limiting conditions.

Osman is happy sharing centre stage with the children. He is a huge fan and has chosen the hospice as one of the charities to benefit from his forthcoming testimonial when Everton face Porto at Goodison Park this Sunday.

Secret: Jasmine Beedles didn't want to tell Leon Osman that she was a Manchester United fan

Opening up: Leon Osman was forthright about his desire to win a trophy with Everton

Leon Osman made his league debut 11 years ago as a substitute in Everton's 4-3 defeat to Tottenham at White Hart Lane on January 12 2003.

Tottenham: Kasey Keller; Stephen Carr, Gary Doherty, Chris Perry, Goran Bunjevcevic; Ledley King, Gus Poyet, Darren Anderton, Simon Davies; Robbie Keane, Steffen Iversen (sub: Milenko Acimov)

His connection was borne out of tragedy, a family bereavement. Osman lost two cousins, sisters Kelly and Stacey Bond, to cystic fibrosis. Seeing what his family went through made Osman, a father of three young children himself, want to help.

'I connected from probably the first time I came here,' he says taking a pause from his poster-paint landscape. 'I was deeply moved by everything that is done.

'I had a family bereavement a few years back and they didn't get as far as Claire House. The Make A Wish Foundation, the other charity I support, took them away but this would have been the next step.

'I saw at first hand what a difference they can make to not just the kids but parents too. It provides families with good memories and gives them a break from what they are going through. I just wanted to try and help with the process.'

The 33-year-old Osman doesn't really fit with football stereotypes. A slightly-built, clever, technically gifted player, he made his breakthrough when the Premier League's penchant was for tall, strong and powerful. Even then a serious knee injury almost derailed his career before it had begun.

He has been with boyhood club Everton since the age of 10. A member of their 1998 FA Youth Cup winning side with the likes of Richard Dunne, Francis Jeffers and Danny Cadamarteri, he scored in the final against Blackburn Rovers with a clipped right foot volley.

It is 11 years since Osman made his league debut for Everton as a late substitute for Chinese midfielder Li Tie in a 4-3 defeat at Tottenham. The game was also notable for being goalkeeper Espen Baardsen's only Everton appearance while Robbie Keane grabbed a hat-trick and a certain Sunderland manager Gus Poyet was also on target for Tottenham. 

More than 380 appearances later, Osman is being rewarded with his testimonial against Porto.

'I certainly never envisaged being here,' he reflected. 'I didn't look that far ahead. It was all about setting goals; going from the youth team, getting games for the reserves, getting games for the first team.

'It feels very weird having a testimonial. The attention is all on you. I have gone through my career without asking for attention so it will be strange knowing everyone is going to be pointing at me as I walk onto the pitch.

'Football has changed so much since that first game. Mainly in its professionalism. When I got into the squad I was told players were looking after themselves better but now it's much different again.'

Can he reason then with Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere's smoking episode? 'I don't know about that. Personally, I've never smoked and I don't understand that. People go out for a glass of wine but I don't think there is the drinking through the week anymore that used to go on.

'Players don't drink much, if at all, in some cases, they eat the right things; off the field you have computer analysis for preparation. You have fitness coaches, who have assistants to assess another part of you, who have assistants to tell you what muscle groups you're using.

'When I started there were some doing things the right way, there were some who didn't bother until the day before the game. I used to think I could get away with eating what I wanted but now the preparation starts as soon as you finish the last game.'

Record buy: Romelu Lukaku completed his £28m move to Everton from Chelsea

Osman figured in every league game under Roberto Martinez last season, the only Everton player to do so and insists he is still improving.

'I have improved. I had good advice from great senior pro's likes David Weir, Alan Stubbs and Duncan Ferguson and I know I'd be quick to help a young player today if I thought they weren't doing things right. You need to if you want to last longer.'

While two England caps, picked up against Sweden and San Marino, have helped make Osman's career more complete there is no disguising what he yearns for most.

'The one thing, the only thing, since I got into the first team is to win a trophy,' he says. 'We've come close but it hasn't been achieved yet and seriously needs to be addressed. With the quality of players we have had over the years and now, with the likes of Romelu Lukaku joining, we should be challenging.'

Testimonials, trophies? Sounds like a scene Osman's fans, even those of Manchester United persuasion, will be happy to paint.
