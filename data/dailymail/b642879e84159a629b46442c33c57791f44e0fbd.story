The United
States will have to negotiate with Syrian President Bashar Assad for a political transition in Syria and is exploring
ways to pressure him into agreeing to talks, U.S. Secretary of
State John Kerry has admitted.

Washington has long insisted that Assad must be replaced
through a negotiated, political transition, but the rise of a
common enemy, hardline militant group Islamic State, has evidently softened the administration's stance towards him.

In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Kerry did not repeat
the standard U.S. line that Assad had lost all legitimacy and
had to go. Syria's civil war is now into its fifth year, with
hundreds of thousands killed and millions of Syrians displaced.

Admission: Secretary of State John Kerry admitted Sunday that the White House is trying to engage the Syrian dictator in negotiations

'We have to negotiate in the end,' Kerry told CBS News. 'We've always
been willing to negotiate in the context of the Geneva I
process,' he added, referring to a 2012 conference which called
for a negotiated transition to end the conflict.

Kerry said the United States and other countries, which he
did not name, were exploring ways to reignite the diplomatic
process to end the conflict in Syria.

'What we're pushing for is to get him (Assad) to come and do
that, and it may require that there be increased pressure on him
of various kinds in order to do that,' the secretary of state
said.

New problem: The U.S. has been more willing to deal with Assad since the rise to power of ISIS in Syria and Iraq

Opposition: Assad's regime is under attack from rebel soldiers, such as those above, as well as ISIS's hordes

'We've made it very clear to people that we are looking at
increased steps that can help bring about that pressure,' he
added.

The United States led efforts to convene a U.N.-backed peace
talks in Geneva last year between Western-backed Syrian
opposition representatives and a government delegation. The
talks collapsed after two rounds and no fresh talks have been
scheduled.

Russia convened some opposition and government figures in
January for talks on the crisis but they yielded little progress
and the main opposition coalition boycotted them.

'To get the Assad regime to negotiate, we're going to have
to make it clear to him that there is a determination by
everybody to seek that political outcome and change his
calculation about negotiating,' Kerry said.

'That's under way right now.  And I am convinced that, with
the efforts of our allies and others, there will be increased
pressure on Assad.'.

Syria sank into civil war after a peaceful street uprising
against four decades of Assad family rule began in March 2011.
The revolt spiraled into an armed insurgency, which has deepened
with the rise of Islamic State and other hardliners.

Assad seems more likely to survive the Syrian crisis than at
any point since it began. Iran's support for Assad is as solid
as ever, with Russia showing no sign of abandoning him.

U.S-led forces started air strikes against Islamic State
group in Syria and Iraq in the summer. Washington has said the
campaign in Syria is not coordinated with the Syrian military,
which also views the group as its enemy.

The war has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced
close to half the population, according to the United Nations.
Damascus accuses its Western and Gulf Arab opponents of seeking
to destroy the country by providing aid to an insurgency now
dominated by jihadists, who also pose a threat to the West.

Assad appears to be betting that the U.S.-led campaign
against Islamic State will force Washington to engage with him.
