An unopened bottle of wine made on the orders of Adolf Hitler to celebrate his 54th birthday has gone up for sale.

The rare 1.5-litre bottle was among a batch made on Hitler's orders to mark his birthday on April 20, 1943, which he then gifted to high-ranking German officers.

The wartime dictator called the red wine 'Fuhrerwein' - meaning 'leader's wine' - and insisted the bottle's label carried a picture of himself in uniform.

A rare unopened 1.5-litre bottle of wine made to celebrate Hitler's birthday in 1943 has surfaced and will now go on sale

A wax label on the bottle carries an image of an eagle on top of a swastika and a stamp of the Reichszeugmeisterei, the central office that supplied Nazi equipment.

The wine itself is 12 per cent Schwarzer Tafelwein - 'black table wine' - thought to have been made in Germany but, despite a wax seal on the bottle, experts say it would now be undrinkable.

Hitler wouldn't have enjoyed the wine himself however, because he was famously teetotal.

The bottle was given to a Hungarian prisoner of war by a German soldier after the war and has remained in the same family ever since.

Hitler had little to celebrate in 1943, as Allied forces turned the tables on the Nazis in Europe and on the Eastern Front.

In
 April 1945, just days after his 56th birthday, Hitler shot himself in 
his underground bunker at the Reich Chancery in Berlin as Soviet forces 
advanced.

The wine, which has been verified by historians, has emerged just days before the 125th anniversary of Hitler's birth in Austria.

It is expected to fetch £2,000 when it is sold following an online auction ending on April 21.

Dominic Hughes, from McTear's Auctioneers in Glasgow, said: 'The bottle was consigned to us by a Hungarian man whose father had procured it during World War II.

'The owner's father was taken as a prisoner of war and when he returned home he was given this bottle by a German soldier. It has been in his family ever since.

'Hitler commissioned the red wine to be made for his 54th birthday to give as presents to his general staff.

'He was so self obsessed that he called the wine Fuhrerwein and insisted the label carried a picture of himself on it.

'The
 wine was possibly produced in Germany and would not have been amazing 
when it was bottled, but now it would be completely undrinkable.

'Two years after it was made Hitler was dead and the war was all but over. The bottle is a 1.5-litre magnum which is very rare.

'I
 think that the bottle is an important historical artifact - it is 
certainly not a bottle that you would come across very often, if at 
all.'

A German gun which was adapted by British secret services for an audacious plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler is now on display in Essex.

The Luger pistol - specially adapted with a British-made silencer - had been set to be used during the Second World War in a bid to kill the Nazi leader at his holiday home in Bavaria.

The plan was eventually ditched in late 1944 after British intelligence disagreed over whether killing the Nazi leader at that point in the war was a sensible strategy.

The specially-silenced Lugar was to be used by a sniper who was going to be dropped behind enemy lines

The pistol is now proudly on display as part of the Donnington Collection at the Combined Military Services Museum in Maldon, Essex.

Clive McPherson, historian at the museum, said: 'I think this is a really interesting sideline to history. It's interesting to think what would be different if they had gone ahead with the plan.'

The assassination attempt - code named 'Operation Foxley' - was put together after a captured German guard revealed Hitler enjoyed a morning walk every day whilst staying at his holiday hideout in the Bavarian Alps.

Hitler would wander unguarded for around 20 minutes from the Berghoff to a local teahouse at around 10am each morning.

Historian Clive McPherson believes the plan never went ahead because Hitler was making so many mistakes at the time, it was better not to kill him

An English sniper and a Polish soldier, who spoke fluent German, were set to be disguised as German mountain troops and parachuted in close to Hitler's residence in Berchtesgaden, Germany, to shoot him as he went for his morning walk.

The sniper was equipped with a Mauser for the sniper shot as well as the specially-silenced Luger pistols to kill anybody who uncovered the plot.

The plan had been set to go ahead around the time of the Normandy landings in June 1944 but was eventually scrapped.

It is believed intelligence chiefs in Britain disagreed over whether killing Hitler was a good idea, with some claiming he was a bad strategist and feared he might be replaced by a better leader, and others believing he could become a martyr to Nazi forces, who would become more difficult to defeat.

The firearm has now gone on display in the Donnington Collection at the Combined Military Services Museum in Maldon, Essex

Other secret murder plots considered included bombing Hitler's personal train or poisoning the water supply.

The Donnington Collection is a unique collection of weapons used and captured by the British Army during the 19th and 20th centuries, assembled by MOD Donnington.

Mr McPherson added: 'These pistols were German but were caught from the enemy during the war.

'Only 10 of the Luger pistols were ever specially adapted by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) for the mission and we have three on display here.

'German's did not use silenced weapons so British-made silencers were added to the pistols.'

There are thought to have been more than 25 attempts to kill Hitler between his rise to power in the 1930s and his death in 1945.

The most famous is the so-called 'July 20 Plot', when senior officer, Colonel Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg (pictured right), planted a bomb at the leader's Wolf's Lair headquarters.

The plot was planned to coincide with a seizure of power in Berlin, but failed when Hitler was only concussed and burned in the blast and the military coup failed.

The botched plan lead to the arrest of around 7,000 people believed to have been involved and the execution of around 5,000.

Colonel von Stauffenberg was played by Tom Cruise in a 2008 film adaption of the episode, called Valkyrie.

In an earlier attempt on Hitler's life, the Oster Conspiracy of 1938, another group of high-ranking German officials planned to storm the Reichkanzlei building.

But the plan relied on strong British opposition to Hitler's seizure of the Sudetenland and after then-Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain signed a peace deal with Hitler the plan fell away.

In a later assasination bid, a Major General Henning von Tresckow attempted to kill Hitler as he flew back from field headquarters near Vinnitsa in Ukraine, on 19 February 1943.

He handed a bomb, disguised as a box containing two bottles of cognac, for a friend in Germany. But the device failed to go off because it was placed in the cargo hold of Hitler's plane, where it is believed to have been too cold for the detonator to work.
