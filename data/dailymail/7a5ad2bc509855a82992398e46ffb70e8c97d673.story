Zara Phillips gave birth to a 7lbs 12oz baby girl at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in the early hours of this morning, with her husband and former England rugby player Mike Tindall present at the birth.

In typically energetic style, she has already left hospital and is back at home with her family.

Early on in her pregnancy the Olympian admitted: 'I have been a bit bored. I'm used to being on the go and active the whole time, and now it's quite different. So, yes, I'm baking. I love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby.'

However, it hasn't all been flapjacks and fondant fancies: the Queen's sporty granddaughter has refused to let pregnancy slow her down too much...

The 32-year-old attended the Heythrop Hunt point-to-point races in Gloucestershire just a few days ago

Continuing the very active manner in which she has approached her pregnancy, the Queen's granddaughter was still out and about just a couple of days before she was due to give birth

Zara has kept remarkably active during her pregnancy, here standing on a car boot ledge to get a better view at  Cottenham point-to-point races in Cambridgeshire on December 30

Just two weeks from giving birth at the time, the Olympian was wrapped up against the cold in a brown padded jacket which had a fur-lined hood

She's attended various country 
point-to-points - one in Cambridgeshire on Sunday - and the races at 
Cheltenham in the last month.

She's
 dressed up for black tie events, such as the British Olympic Ball and 
the reunion of the 2004 Rugby Union World Cup-winning squad in November,
 while heavily pregnant.

In fact, Zara's sense of style appears to have blossomed along with her bump during the last nine months.

She
 dazzled onlookers at Sandringham in a bright red jacket and matching 
hat trimmed with jaunty feathers and a black MUlberry ckutch at the 
Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene Church on the vast Norfolk 
estate.

The professional 
three-day eventer was pictured early in her pregnancy taking part in a 
show jumping event and even playing polo, but gave up competing in her fifth month and has 
since been channelling her energy into helping a race horse part-owned 
by her husband become a champion.

At eight months pregnant, Zara swathed her impressive bump in a bright red jacket and matching hat for the service at St Mary Magdalene Church on the vast Norfolk estate

Prior to the service, Zara appeared to have put comfort first as she paired a warm black winter coat with a pair of knee-high brown stretchy boots

In December, the horse, Monbeg Dude, won the Majordomo Hospitality Handicap Steeple Chase at Cheltenham.

Miss
 Phillips, who won silver at the London Olympics as part of the British 
three-day eventing team, said she has stopped riding not because she had
 been criticised for it but because it had become too difficult in the 
fifth month of her pregnancy.

She
 said: ‘It’s so uncomfortable. So now I’m just on the ground yelling at 
everyone.’ But she added that she will back on her horse as soon as 
possible after the birth.

Equestrian Zara didn't let being eight months pregnant stop her attending the Majordomo Hospitality Handicap Steeple Chase, where a horse part-owned by her husband Mike Tindall won

At seven months pregnant, Zara showed no signs of slowing down as she watched her husband Mike Tindall's horse Monbeg Dude come fourth in the Murphy Group Handicap Chase in November

The
 couple revealed that Zara's pregnancy came as a complete ‘shock’ to her
 – disrupting her eventing schedule and forcing her out of the saddle.

Speaking
 to an Australian Women’s Weekly in October, Mike said: ‘It probably 
happened quicker than we thought – bit of a shock, really.’

But he admitted that once the surprise had worn off, they realised the timing was perfect.

Zara
 says she will be back in the saddle straight after the birth. She even 
hopes to compete in the World Eventing Championship in August and will 
take her baby with her on the eventing circuit – which is what her 
mother Princess Anne did after Zara was born.

Typically, Zara and Mike Tindall have appeared very laid-back during the pregnancy.

Mike revealed the couple didn't want to know the sex of their baby before the birth.

Mr
 Tindall said in October: ‘We want it to be a surprise. I’m really 
looking forward to it, but I’m not sure how I’ve prepared. We’ve been 
pretty relaxed.

‘We’ve not sorted a nursery yet. We have ordered some stuff, but we haven’t gone further than that.

‘I
 think we’re both quite well-balanced as a couple, so hopefully he or 
she will pick up on that. I’m a big kid, so I naturally fit right in.’

Zara added: ‘I hope we’re going to make good parents – that’s the plan.’
