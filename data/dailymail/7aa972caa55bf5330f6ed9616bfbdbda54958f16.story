A schoolboy who missed lessons on doctor's orders has been refused a sixth form place because he did not go to school often enough. 

Daniel Keyworth, 16, had hoped to continue his studies with A-Levels at Wickersley School in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, after completing his summer's exams.

However, the teenager, who has a number of medical conditions and underwent facial surgery twice last year, had his application refused because of his high absence record.

'Last year he had a bit of time off because of his operations and other medical conditions,' said Daniel's mother Tracy, 48.

Daniel Keyworth, 16, has been told he cannot sit his A-Levels at Wickersley Academy in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, after missing too many lessons. But his mother, Tracy, pictured, said his low attendance was due to doctor's orders

'When he's not well, I've always had him to the doctor. It's always been the doctor's advice.

'When they tell me to keep him off school, that's what I do.

'I'm a single parent with no transport, so when he's been at Sheffield Children's Hospital, it takes us three buses each way to get to appointments.

'I've done everything right and in Daniel's interests. That's what makes this so upsetting.'

In February last year Daniel had a septoplasty - a corrective procedure to straighten the nasal septum.

He needed the same procedure revised in July, when cartilage from his ear was put in his nose. Daniel missed two weeks' school while recovering each time.

His other complaints include Raynaud's phenomenon, which affects the blood supply to the fingers and toes, asthma, eczema and a list of allergies.

Daniel's mother said she didn't 'really know what to make of it' after her son's application to stay on at Wickersley School, pictured,  was rejected

Tracy, from Rotherham, said it felt like there had been a tug of war between ensuring Daniel went to school and taking care of his ailments.

After he was rejected, she said: 'I don't really know what to make of it.

'I've written letters but don't know what else to do. Daniel enjoys school. 

'He likes photography, graphics and science and he wants to do A-Levels after his exams. 

'He's been getting there, slowly, and doing his best.'

Tracy said Daniel's progress had also been hampered by the school losing coursework for graphics and photography.

A Wickersley School spokeswoman said: 'We have no comment to make.' 

The septum is the structure that separates the right and left nostrils in the nose. 

It is made up of cartilage  at the front and bone further back.

The septum is important in maintaining the shape of your nose. 

If the septum is bent or damaged it can cause a blockage or inflammation within the nose which can turn to mucus and a nasal drip.

A septoplasty procedure involves operating inside the nose to straighten the septum.  

It involves a doctor exposing the bone or cartilage that is causing the blockage.

The obstruction is then removed or straightened. 

Most patients who have the operation, which lasts between 30 minutes and an hour, are able to go home the same day.
