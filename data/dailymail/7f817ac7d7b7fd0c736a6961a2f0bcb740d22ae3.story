Sportsmail asked Manchester United blog Stretty News about the dilemma facing Louis van Gaal as he mulls over who to appoint as his captain to replace the departed Nemanja Vidic.

Shortly after the exit of Nemanja Vidic came the arrival of new manager Louis van Gaal. The Serbian’s departure sparked a debate over who will become club captain, but the Dutchman is adamant that he will not rush the awaited decision.

Van Gaal speaks regularly on how 
important deciding a captain is for his side. He looks for players with 
similar outlooks to himself on life and, of course, football philosophy.
 While leading Holland to a World Cup semi-final, he named Robin van 
Persie captain, which reveals the pre-existing trust within their 
working relationship, thereby making the striker a prominent 
front-runner for the United job.

Decision time: Louis van Gaal will name his Manchester United captain before the start of the season

'For me, it [is] always very important, the choice of the captain, because he is the captain on the pitch, and he can enlarge my influence,' Van Gaal told Sky Sports. 'He more or less needs to have the same philosophy and the way of seeing life. That [person] is not so simple to choose, so I need time to do that.'

This summer alone, Manchester United have lost four players that have previously served as captain: Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra, and Ryan Giggs. Each one’s leadership was significant in the dressing room, and will be missed. At the  least, Giggs is still present as assistant manager.

In the current squad, Wayne Rooney has most frequently worn the captain’s armband, but, being unfamiliar to Van Gaal, is not a definite shout for the role. At the moment, four players are in contention for captaincy. They are as follows, in no particular order:

Robin van Persie

Van Persie played six matches (548 minutes in total) at the World Cup, scoring four goals. Yet, Van Gaal was not afraid to substitute his main man up top when they were in search of a goal. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was the usual replacement, and the Schalke man rewarded his boss with a key goal and an assist in three energetic appearances.

The argument against making Van Persie captain would be his well-publicised clashes with David Moyes, last season. Time may have borne out many of his opinions, but issues within the club should stay there, rather that be aired out in the press. The new manager’s previous relationship with the player, however, makes any repeat episodes highly unlikely.

It was no secret that Van Persie struggled to get on with Moyes and was tempted on more than one occasion to leave the club. Sir Alex Ferguson had promised to be there the for three seasons of Van Persie's contract but now when he looks at it, things could not have worked out better.

Wayne Rooney

Having deputised for others on several occasions, serving as the de facto captain would be a role that Wayne Rooney would relish. Approached with the proper attitude the responsibility could carry him to the next level in his development as a player, building confidence within him, and transforming what has become a tarnished image without. Earning the new manager’s trust, and leading United back into the Premier League title race would also bolster his credentials for the recently-vacated England captaincy.

Rooney's previous contract maneuverings, with rumours that he was pushing for a move to City in 2010, and Chelsea last summer, are the same type of dissension in which Van Persie engaged with Moyes. There are also the troubles with his fitness and accusations regarding an off-season regimen erring on the side of light. Van Gaal surely knows about these issues, and will wish to see nothing less than a full commitment to training, and to the club, before he is willing to trust the face of Manchester United with its future. Such a commitment, however, will have supporters looking eagerly towards his ascension up the venerated club's all-time goal-scoring list, on which his 216 trail only Denis Law's 237 and Sir Bobby Charlton's 249.

It is said that Moyes had intended to hand the captaincy to Rooney this season, with Nemanja Vidic's retirement to San Siro completed, but, at this point, the United universe is past caring the least what Moyes' plans were. For his own betterment, Rooney should be, as well.

Jonny Evans

The Northern Ireland centre half has endured a couple of rough patches at Manchester United since he broke into the first team. Evans was often offered up as the sacrificial lamb after poor results, regardless of the self-evidence of his ability and potential. It has become all too familiar for United to have a wrongly acclaimed scapegoat down the years. Like Michael Carrick, Jonny Evans has been successful in terms of proving many doubters wrong, but to this day others remain none the wiser. In fact, of the club’s current defenders, he is arguably the best. Both Chris Smalling and Phil Jones have some work to do.

In regards to captaincy, Evans is a personal favourite for the role. The 26-year-old already has already displayed leadership. Many will argue that he remains a work in progress, but if the time is not now, do not be surprised if it arrives soon. Following loan spells at Royal Antwerp and Sunderland, the centre back returned to Old Trafford with vast improvements and it was only a matter of time before Sir Alex Ferguson made use of that. Van Gaal has an eye for talent, and surely will, as well.

Darren Fletcher

What a U-turn Darren Fletcher has made with his football career. A year or so ago, everyone, including Sir Alex Ferguson, doubted whether he would play again after a difficult battle with an intestinal disease.

The Scot has slowly but surely returned, but uncertainty over the permanence of his recovery, and his match fitness, place him on the perimeter of the squad. He seems a newcomer rather than an old veteran.

I suspect that Gordon Strachan’s captain with the Scottish national team will have to do more than even Rooney to earn the armband from Van Gaal.

Michael Carrick (n/a)

Unfortunately, Michael Carrick’s serious ankle injury, suffered prior to the pre-season tour, has put him on the shelf for three months. It goes without saying that the knock completely rules him out of the this race for captaincy.

In terms of leadership, Carrick let himself down last season. He was one of the players expected to pull his weight when United’s backs were against the wall. Saying that, it was a season the club need to write off, and, had he not been injured, Carrick would have deserved the same clean slate now being given to Van Persie.

The quicker United get Carrick back into the fold the better. Maybe not as captain, mind.

Louis van Gaal has come into the job late, but with no preconceptions, and no sense of urgency. Every player in the squad is being given the opportunity to impress. The Dutchman will continue to observe his squad for the remainder of this US tour, searching for the perfect blend of youth, talent, athleticism, experience, and leadership. He is more patient with the process than United supporters who have just endured the worst season in living memory. When he is ready, he will name his squad, and captain.

Until then, all the rest of us can do is guess.
