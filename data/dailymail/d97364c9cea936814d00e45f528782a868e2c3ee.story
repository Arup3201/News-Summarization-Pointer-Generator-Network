This is the moment the world's only surviving set of giant panda triplets opened their eyes for the first time - more than a month after their birth.

The trio were hailed as a 'miracle' because of the animal's famously low reproductive rate.

Mother panda Ju Xiao, meaning 'chrysanthemum smile', delivered the triplets at Guangzhou's Chimelong Safari Park in the early hours of July 29.

The extremely rare panda triplets were born at Chimelong Safari Park, Guangzhou, China, on July 29

They were conceived after she was paired with 17-year-old Lin Lin in March.

A video from the zoo showed the three cubs now covered with white and black fur squealing and moving about with their eyes open.

'The panda triplets have all opened their eyes and are in good, healthy condition,' according to a statement from Chimelong Safari Park.

'Each one is starting to show its own individuality. For example, the third one is the most lively,'

They are now  living in wooden boxes.

The second panda to be born was the first to open their eyes, followed by the lastborn and then the firstborn

They all weigh between 5.9 and 6.3 pounds, but the gender of the cubs cannot be determined until they grow older.

A naming competition is already underway and will end in mid-October.

The first known case of triplets from a giant panda was recorded in 1999, when a 15-year-old mother gave birth following artificial insemination in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu.

But the youngest of the trio died after living for just three days because of a bladder disorder.

The birth of rare panda triplets is a further success for China's artificial breeding program.

Giant pandas have an insatiable appetite for bamboo and they eat 12 out of every 24 hours.

It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's daily dietary needs and they will sometimes eat birds or rodents as well.

Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. 

They may climb as high as 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.

Adults can grow to between 4ft and 6ft long, weighing up to 160kg. 

Pandas are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture, with their hind legs stretched out before them. They may appear sedentary, but they are skilled tree-climbers and efficient swimmers.

Giant pandas are solitary. They have a highly developed sense of smell that males use to avoid each other and to find females for mating in the spring. 

Female can only conceive during their two to three day  estrous period, which occurs just once a year in the spring.

After a five-month pregnancy, females give birth to a cub or two, though they cannot care for both twins. 

The blind infants weigh only 5 ounces (142 grams) at birth and cannot crawl until they reach three months of age. 

They are born white, and develop their much loved coloring later.

There are only about 1,000 giant pandas left in the wild, with around 100 pandas living in zoos
