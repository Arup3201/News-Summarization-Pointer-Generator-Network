A manor house with its own indoor theatre which has seen the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Rowan Atkinson, Esther Rantzen, and even the cast of EastEnders walk the boards has gone on sale for £5million.

Little Easton Manor, in Dunmow near Bishop’s Stortford, Essex, was first built in in the 17th century on an estate that dates back to the Roman era and featured in the Domesday Book of 1086.

It formed part of the 10,000-acre Estaines estate that was given to politician Sir Henry Maynard in 1590 by Queen Elizabeth I and after he built the house it was passed down through his family for the next 300 years.

Little Easton Manor, in Dunmow, Essex, was built by Sir Henry Maynard who was given land by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 as part of Estaines estate

Property passed down through his family for 300 years before Francis 'Daisy' Maynard converted tithe barn into theatre in the early 1900s

Actress Ellen Terry gave readings while H.G. Wells, who lived on the estate, also visited. Other performers included Charlie Chaplin, Gracie Fields and George Formby

The estate itself dates back to the Roman era and was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 before the eight-bedroom mansion was ever built

In 1865 the 66-acre estate was inherited by socialite Frances ‘Daisy’ Maynard, who was said to have been the inspiration for Harry Dacre’s famous song Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two).

Daisy,  the long-term mistress of Albert, Prince of Wales who was eventually crowned King Edward VII, became the Countess of Warwick in 1881.

It was only in the early 1900s that she had the tithe barn transformed into a theatre which saw the great and the good of the acting world  perform there.

Edwardian actress Ellen Terry gave poetry readings while War Of The Worlds author H.G. Wells, who lived with his family in a house on the estate, also frequented the theatre. Other regular performers included Charlie Chaplin, Gracie Fields and George Formby. 

Comedian Charlie Chaplin and singer Gracie Fields were known to regularly perform at the theatre in Little Easton Manor after the barn was converted

The outside of the property is painted in traditional 'Essex Pink' while the grounds include formal gardens (pictured) along with a tennis court and swimming pool

Other actors to have performed on the stage at Little Easton Manor include Rowan Atkinson, Bill Cotton, Tim Rice, Esther Rantzen and the cast of Eastenders

The grounds of the house, which feature fishing lakes and two cottage, have been used as the setting for multiple TV shows including BBC 1 series Lovejoy

Author H.G. Wells, who lived in a house in the grounds with his family, and entertainer George Formby were also among early fixtures at the playhouse

In 1925 famed film director Basil Dean acquired the manor through his marriage to the Countess’ daughter Lady Mercy Greville before embarking on a grand renovation project. 

Dean sold the manor in 1939 after his marriage to Lady Greville broke down and it passed through several hands until it was snapped up by Neville Pedley, a skilled carpenter, and his wife Vera in 1971.

The couple took on the renovation of the barn theatre and during their ownership it welcomed a new generation of stars including Rowan Atkinson, Bill Cotton, Tim Rice, Esther Rantzen and even the cast of Eastenders.

The eight-bedroom house and grounds was also used as the settings for numerous television programmes including BBC 1 series Lovejoy.

The Grade II listed manor, which is painted in traditional ‘Essex pink’, also has a drawing room, dining room, sitting room, office and cellars. Within its grounds are fishing lakes, two cottages, formal gardens, a tennis court and swimming pool.

It is on the market with Carter Jonas estate agents for £5million.

Steven Foreman, from Carter Jonas, said: 'Little Easton House is very special. Country houses like this don’t come up for sale very often so to be able to sell this is a rare treat.

As well as fishing lakes in the grounds, the eight-bedroom house also includes a drawing room, dining room, sitting room, office and cellars

Estate agents Carter Jonas said the home is already self-sufficient as it has already been used multiple times as a wedding venue and people will pay to use the lakes

'It really is a lovely house. It has all aspects covered - aside from its wonderful theatre there are a number of lakes for fishing, and it is very popular as a wedding venue.

'Country houses come with the burden of significant maintenance costs but Little Easton generates enough income to easily cover these. It is self sufficient.

'A lot of very famous people have performed in the barn theatre over the years from the likes of Gracie Fields and H.G. Wells to Rowan Atkinson and Tim Rice. There is so much history to Little Easton Manor - it is a real English gem.'
