With its dirty sheets, empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts and discarded underwear, it is the most infamous bed in the world.

Having recently sold for more than £2.5million, Tracey Emin’s artwork ‘My Bed’, the product of a chaotic low point in her life when a failed romance resulted in severe depression, must also be among the most expensive.

But despite being directly inspired by the messy scene left after she spent four days in bed after the break-up, a leading art expert has cast doubt on whether Miss Emin ever actually slept in her crumpled creation.

Tracy Emin sits in front of her 1998 piece 'My Bed' on display at Christie's in June. With its dirty sheets, empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts and discarded underwear, it is the most infamous bed in the world

Martin Kemp, emeritus professor of art history at Oxford University, inspected the 1998 artwork, which comes with a dossier of photographs of the detritus and instructions for where to put each object every time it is reassembled, in its various incarnations, including its first display in Japan and in the 1999 Turner Prize exhibition after it was shortlisted for the award.

Professor, Kemp, an authority on Leonardo da Vinci, said: ‘I began to wonder… have any of those beds really been slept on continuously over four sweaty and desperate days?’

He noticed the creases are ‘caused by rumpling, not sharp, compressed creases caused by a warm body’, the pillows show no compression by a head and the bed-base of the Japan version has a different graining pattern.

‘Look at the various incarnations of My Bed and it’s clear that the detritus of Emin’s legendary four days in bed has been reconfigured a good deal,’ Professor Kemp said.

‘Discussions tend to be about autobiography, about feminism, obvious theoretical things, all of which are relevant… Nobody has really looked at these as I would look at versions of a Leonardo painting…

‘It’s not just some things not arranged scrupulously, which is fine. They’re actually different items.’

He concluded that the different versions are not one bed in which Miss Emin slept for a long time, adding that if she had lain in the bed ‘its conservation state would be pretty horrendous.

‘Organic materials don’t do nice things if they’re left… Why doesn’t it smell?’ he wondered.

Advertising executive Charles Saatchi, the ex-husband of chef Nigella Lawson, bought the work for £150,000 in 2000. He sold at auction it to an anonymous buyer for £2,546,500 in July, more than triple the guide price of £800,000.

Despite his observations, Professor Kemp regards Emin as a ‘brilliant’ artist and says the myth she created behind ‘My Bed’ should not be taken literally. He plans to include ‘My Bed’ in his new book to be published next month.

Asked about Professor Kemp’s comments, Miss Emin, 51, who was awarded a CBE for services to the arts in the New Year honours list two years ago, said: ‘The bed came directly from my flat. When I say ‘My Bed’ I mean it was the idea of the artwork.

‘The bed has gone through many transformations. In a way it’s a self-portrait. It’s like a ‘Descartes-ian’ theory of the soul: the candle burns, but the wax still remains in a different form… As I get older my face changes, my skin changes.

‘Every time I reinstall the bed it will always be different. [After my death], the people… will install it differently because of the nature of how I haunt the room.

‘The bed is the physical ghost of my own existence.’
