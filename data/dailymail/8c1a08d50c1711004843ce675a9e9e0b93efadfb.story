The reality of family life has not changed much since the 1950s with mums still responsible for most of the household chores, particularly at Christmas, watchdogs have ruled.

An increasing number of women are in the workforce, bringing greater financial independence, while new men are apparently willing to take a turn at shopping and ironing.

However, a Christmas TV ad for Asda, which showed a mum weighed down with all the festive preparations, has been cleared of being sexist on the basis it simply reflected real life.

Off the hook: Supermarket Asda's Christmas advert from 2012, featuring a mother stressed out by festive preparations, has been ruled not sexist

The commercial showed the exhausted mum struggling to buy the presents and tree, decorating the home, wrapping the gifts, writing cards and cooking the festive feast.

At the same time, the dad and the rest of the family were very much in the background, being waited on, feet up and having fun.

The Advertising Standards Authority(ASA) received 620 complaints from both mums and dads, claiming the images reinforced outdated stereotypes and were sexist.

While hundreds more joined the chorus of disapproval on Twitter and Facebook, including the Radio 4 Woman’s Hour presenter, Jane Garvey, who said she felt like putting her foot through the TV set.

However, the ASA has ruled that despite 
major changes in family life and the belief that men now carry more of 
the domestic load, not much has changed in the last 60 years.

Stereotype: The advertisement sees a young mother stress to create the perfect Christmas for her family whilst her partner and children play a minor role in the preparations

Row: Hundreds complained that the advertisement was sexist and reinforced outdated stereotypes

The voice-over at the end of the commercial stated: ‘It doesn’t just happen by magic. Behind every great Christmas, there’s mum, and behind mum there’s Asda.’

The supermarket produced research among 1,896 mothers who shop with them to back up its belief that women still carry the weight of running the home, particularly at Christmas.

The research found that 86per cent said they were mainly in charge of shopping for presents, while 84per cent were mainly in charge of wrapping them.

At the same time, the vast majority, 78per cent said they were mainly in charge of shopping for Christmas food.

Asda said that while they appreciated the role of mother and father differed between households, they intended to portray a scene which reflected the actual Christmas experience of the majority of customers.

Accurate representation: The Advertising Standards Agency ruled that the commercial was not sexist but reflects 'a significant number' of Christmases in Britain

The store also argued that while the 
father was in the background, he played a positive role in helping with 
preparations, hosting the family and making sure the children were 
entertained.

At the time the
commercial was running, Justine Roberts, founder of the Mumsnet 
parenting website, said it was the subject of more than 1,000 comments 
on its forums in less than 24 hours.

‘Most users were irritated by what 
they saw as a patronising portrayal of an outdated version of family 
life and argued that the days when men sit around demanding their tea 
are long gone,’ she said.

However,
she said a significant number also accepted that the theme reflected 
the real division of labour in their households over Christmas.

Among
the 620 to complain were members of Fathers 4 Justice. It even 
encouraged supporters to stage a series of ‘occupy’-style protests at 
Asda supermarkets, starting with a flagship store in Wigan.

Upset: Complaints regarded the images and the voiceover which stated that behind 'every great Christmas, there's mum, and behind mum there's Asda'

Some people felt the advertisement might be particularly upsetting for children who had lost their mother.

However, the ASA rejected all the complaints, saying the images really did accurately represent the Christmas experience for ‘a significant number’ of families.

As a result, it said the ad ‘was not likely to be seen as condoning or encouraging harmful discriminatory behaviour, or reinforcing negative stereotypes of men or women’.

The watchdog said: ‘We acknowledged that single fathers and men with primary domestic responsibilities might find the presentation of the mother playing the central role in the Christmas preparations distasteful.’ However, it said this was unlikely to cause serious offence.

Similarly, it rejected the idea that children without mothers would suffer any serious hurt.
