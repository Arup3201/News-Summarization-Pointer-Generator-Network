A long-distance swimmer who calls himself 'The Shark' jumped into Michigan's Lake St. Clair this morning - for a 30-hour, 22-mile dip.

If that isn't enough, Jim Dreyer will be hauling dinghies filled with 2,000 pounds of bricks.

The 49 year old started his swim from a spot near Algonac, and will end Tuesday at Detroit's Belle Isle.

Dreyer has previously made direct crossings of each of the five Great Lakes.

The keen swimmer is raising money and awareness for Habitat for Humanity and he's doing it without a support boat.

But one of the dinghies is equipped with a radar target so Dreyer will show up on radar screens of passing freighters.

His GPS tracking device will post his position online and he can communicate with it too - sending out per-programmed messages to let crew know he's OK or if he needs help.

He has to feed himself and won't leave the water until coming ashore in Detroit.

Dreyer calls the mission - including hauling the dinghies filled with 334 bricks - his 'train of pain',

He waded out into the water on Monday morning off the Clinton River Boat Club in Clay Township.

Dreyer took off in a wetsuit and said 'Next stop, Detroit', as onlookers gathered to watch.

During a previous crossing in Lake Superior, Dreyer overcame high waves, falling ill and vomiting, and even lost 20lbs while crossing Lake Huron.

But for his latest mission, he's been training since October and was pleased that current water temperatures are between 68 and 71 degrees farenheit.
