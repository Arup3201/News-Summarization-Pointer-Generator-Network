A Maine motorist is lucky to be alive after a moose smashed into the windshield and completely through to the back seat on Sunday.

Mark Forino, 34, miraculously escaped with only minor scrapes after he was unable to swerve away from the massive beast while driving in Ashland Sunday night.

The Presque Isle man narrowly escaped being struck by the moose and is traveled into the 2006 Toyota Sienna's passenger compartment.

Mangled: Maine man Mark Forino was unable to avoid striking a moose in the road in Ashland on Sunday night

Unblieveable: The massive beast smashed through the windshield of his Toyota minivan and all the way through to the back seat

Relieved family: Even more shocking than the horrific crash was the fact that Forino, a father of two who was alone in the vehicle, escaped with just some scrapes and glass in his eyes

The father of two needed his eyes flushed of glass at the scene from the shattered windshield before being released to his no doubt relieved family.

Forino posted photos of his smashed car to Facebook Monday morning.

His friends and family were understandably horrified by what they saw.

One Facebook friend, astounded by the gutted white family vehicle, summed things up nicely:

'Holy s*** Mark. Thank god your family wasn't with you,' said Jenette Talbot.

Another friend wondered, 'Do you get to keep the kill?'

Completely smashed: Forino posted the shocking aftermath to his Facebook on Monday morning

Hair-raising: The accident occurred Sunday night in the town of Ashland. At right, an unrelated Facebook photo of Forino reveals how he likely felt after the moose barely missed him on its path toward the back seat

The answer to his question, at least in the state of Maine, is a definite yes.

Authorities there give motorists unlucky enough to hit a moose--and lucky enough to survive the impact--first dibs on the very large and, to some, very delicious carcass. 

Tim Cotton of the Bangor Police Department told boston.com in October:

'When a car hits a game animal, the person that hits the animal gets first dibs,

'Some people don’t have stomach for wild game, so a lot of police departments keep a list of people who would like to pick up the animal. 

'If the driver refuses the road kill, police use the list to attempt to contact someone willing to come get the animal.'

Blood from the animal can clearly be made out in the front passenger seat. Per Maine state law, Forino will have first dibs on the animal's carcass -- if he refuses, state police have a list of people they know will be interested
