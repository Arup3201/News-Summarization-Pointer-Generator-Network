Britons blew away their New Year hangovers by enjoying a dip in the seas and rivers as temperatures soared to near record levels yesterday, but forecasters warned chillier climes would return today with wintry rain in the north.

The Met Office said yesterday's highest temperature of 15.1C was recorded at Murlough, County Down, with peak figures in England reaching 13.9C at Bude in Cornwall. They were close to the record set almost a century ago in 1916 when Bude in Cornwall saw 15.6C (60f).

However last night was wet and windy in the South East, with showers most frequent in western Scotland and snow expected over the hills.

Today south-east England will see early mild and damp conditions clear, joining the rest of the UK in a chilly and breezy day. Northern parts will see the coldest and windiest of the weather, including wintry showers, but much of the UK will see decent amounts of winter sunshine.

Calum MacColl, meteorologist for the Met Office, told MailOnline: ‘Friday will be a very nice day for southern areas with plenty of winter sunshine, but in Scotland and the North a few showers.

‘There will probably be an early maximum temperature tomorrow in the South East, but as the day wears on it cools off.

At 8am yesterday temperatures observed in Britain included 11C (52F) in Cardiff, 10C (50F) in Edinburgh, 9C (48F) in Belfast and 8C (46F) in London. But as of 4pm, the Met Office said the top temperature recorded so far was only 14.1C (57F) in County Down, Northern Ireland.

In the morning, dozens of brave swimmers took to the North Sea for their annual New Year's Eve dip off the coast of Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear. About 50 members of the Panama Swimming Club, based in the North Tyneside town, shrieked as they entered the chilly waters.

Some wore wigs while one girl was dressed as a Santa's elf and other costumes included a giraffe and Father Christmas.

In contrast a group of young women frolicked in the ocean wearing nothing but bikinis despite the frosty weather. 

But the Met Office issued a yellow ‘be aware’ severe weather warning for wind in north Wales, northern England and southern Scotland. And the Environment Agency has two flood alerts out - for the coast at Bridlington, East Yorkshire, and the area around Grantham, Lincolnshire.

Exposed coastal areas were also battered by rain and wind, with gusts reaching up to 60mph in some areas. A Met Office spokesman said the changeable weather would continue over the coming days.

Speaking to MailOnline yesterday, Mr MacColl said of the weather: ‘Today it’s very mild for the time of the year across a large part of the country.

‘Temperatures could reach 14C (57F) and even 15C (59F) in the likes of north-east Wales and the east of the Pennines too.

‘Temperatures are well above where they should be for the time of year. For most of the country we’ll be seeing temperatures into double figures.

‘There will be very mild temperatures, but I’m sure a lot of people will prefer tomorrow’s set-up with a lot more sunshine.’

Cloud and rain looks set to push eastwards across southern parts of the UK on Saturday, and the north will be bright but cold.

It will be dry and fine for many on Sunday, albeit chilly, while cloud and patchy drizzle may push into western parts later.

The wettest UK area yesterday was Achnagart in the Highlands with 1.15in (29.2mm) of rain, while Wittering, Lincolnshire, was sunniest with 5.8 hours.

The coldest area was Farnborough in Hampshire at -6.7C (20F), and the warmest was Kinlochewe, Highlands, at 12.4C (54F), reported BBC Weather.
