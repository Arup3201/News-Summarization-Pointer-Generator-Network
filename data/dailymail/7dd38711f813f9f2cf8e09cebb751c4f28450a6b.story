Buses may be forced to increase their loads as passengers' waistlines continue to expand at a frightening speed across Australia.

Two-axle buses are feeling a serious strain from heavier commuters with an almost 20 per cent rise in overweight and obese adults, prompting the National Transport Commission to call for an extra two tonnes to be added onto the maximum limit.

Experts say that although these statistics are not surprising, it is yet another sign that obesity is a growing concern in Australia.

The maximum load on buses may be increased by two tonnes due to Australians gaining weight

Obesity has increased almost 20 per cent between 1989 and 2012

Aloysa Hourigan from Nutrition Australia said obesity is a very real issue across the country.

'It highlights that we as a nation really need to keep working hard at all levels to turn it around, although it's not a quick fix problem,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It is important for the safety of people to have appropriate transport arrangements and obviously if that is affecting the safety of buses then they need to address that.'

The NTC's annual report states that when the laws were designed in 1989 the average adult's weight was taken as 65kg.

However, that was a conservative estimate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with the average man weighing in at 77.4kg and the average woman at 62.6kg.

Since then, waistlines have only continued growing.

The NTC says a 2011-12 Australian Health Survey found the average male had increased to 86kg, while the average weight for a female was 71kg. 

The health report further found about 63 per cent of adults were now overweight or obese - up from 45 per cent in 1989. 

'It is possible that buses can be technically overloaded even when within their maximum passenger operating limits,' the NTC annual report explains.

Something's got to give, argue bus operators, and the NTC has recommended that the National Vehicle Regulator develop a notice to allow an 18-tonne nationwide limit. 

Ms Hourigan said the obesity problem could stretch across all forms of transport.

'It's the same thing when you hope into a lift and it says this lift for 10 people and you look around and think "well they would have to be 10 very slim people to fit in here",' she said.

'So it is an increasing problem certainly on other forms of transport - the dilemma is there whether it be planes.'

But buses are not just struggling with fatter passengers.

Wheelchair access lifts, fuel-efficient engines, rollover protection devices and air-conditioning units are also adding weight to each bus.

The notice to increase the limit by two tonnes is expected to be progressed over the next year, the NTC said.

Ms Hourigan said society must not lose hope on improving the issue with education and prevention being the key factors.

'There are little glimmers of hope around such as in the U.S where the consumption of McDonald's and Coca Cola has been decreasing and their sales are dropping - perhaps it will be a bit of a trend that might reflect back eventually on weight loss but it takes time to see those changes,' she said.

'In Australia we know there has been a bit of improvement with children - but again it takes time to make those changes - but it means that governments need to keep investing in prevention programs and in ways of dealing with the problem.'
