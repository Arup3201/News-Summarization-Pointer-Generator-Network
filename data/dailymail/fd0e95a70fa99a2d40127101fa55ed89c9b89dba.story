New Delhi played host to a mass marriage ceremony today at a local temple in the old quarters.

Twelve brides and grooms from impoverished families gathered together to tie the knot in a joint ceremony organised by social groups to help those who aren't able to afford the traditionally lavish marriage events.

If undertaken on their own, such an event could set each family back hundreds of thousands of Indian rupees.

Group weddings are not uncommon and a sensible economic decision in many cases to dramatically reduce the cost for the venue, decorations and officiants.

Even the celebrations afterwards are a collective affair. 

Three years ago India had a collective wedding ceremony involving 3,600 couples - many the children of poor farmers - including Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims and Adivasi.

Recommendations on restrictions on spending came from India’s Dowry Prevention Act.
