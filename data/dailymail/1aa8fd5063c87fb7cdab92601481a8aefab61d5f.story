With sun-kissed locks and golden skin, it is a widespread assumption that people look better in the summer months than during the great winter chill when hands are dry and noses snuffly.

And one dating agency is now urging people to 'summer-proof' their online photos in order to increase their chances of finding romance.

Match.com has suggested members add more summery photographs of themselves and remove the wintry ones, after their survey revealed 73 per cent of people find others more attractive during summer than winter.

Looking good, Tulisa: According to the latest survey, we really do look hotter in the summer, and over half of us feel far more attractive in the warmer months

The study asked people to select the 
more attractive from two images of the same person taken in winter and 
summer, and almost three out of four people selected the summer photos.

When asked why, the respondents said that the summer shots looked happier (72 per cent), healthier (50 per cent), and more confident (37 per cent), while 21 per cent said they thought it was because people were wearing nicer clothes and accessories.

Researchers found 73 per cent of people said others were more attractive in the summer than winter, while women are more likely than men to look better in the summer month.

More than half the people polled (54 per cent) said they feel more attractive in the summer, while just one in 50 (two per cent) felt they look better in the winter.

Interestingly, women are more likely than men to visibly reap the physical benefits of the summer months.

Some 82 per cent of those voting on the female photos indicated ladies were more attractive in the summer, compared to nearly two-thirds (65 per cent) who thought the men looked better in the warmer months.

Kate Taylor, resident relationship expert at match.com, said: 'It's natural that we find others more appealing in the summer.

'Typically, both sexes look better when outdoors and relaxed rather than huddled up in hats and scarves. Plus, you're more likely to be outside enjoying the sunshine and having a good time, and this comes across as much in a photo as it does in person.'

Profile update: Online dating companies are urging people to add more summery pictures to their social media pages to attract more attention

She added: 'If you are currently dating, or looking to start, now is the perfect time to show what makes you great.

'Make the most of looking happier and healthier, and use the extra confidence boost to meet even more new people.

'If you're using a dating service, make sure you have a summery photo for your profile picture, as this will make you look even more attractive in the eyes of your potential date.

'In fact, why not take the opportunity to give your whole profile a make-over and ensure you're summer-ready.'
