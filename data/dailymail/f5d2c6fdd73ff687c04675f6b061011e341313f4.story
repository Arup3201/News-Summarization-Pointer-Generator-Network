Scientists have got to the root of cancer.

They’ve pinpointed the deadly ‘mother cells’ that give birth to tumours and keep them alive.

A drug that kills these menacing cells could wipe out the disease – and cure patients.

Despite advances in medicine, cancer claims more than 150,000 lives a year, making it one of Britain’s biggest killers.

The ‘mother cells’, or cancer stem cells, are blamed for the disease’s spread throughout the body – the most common cause of death in cancer patients.

They are also believed to be resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and so explain why cancers come back after treatment.

Long thought to exist, they have for the first time been identified and tracked in cancer patients.

The breakthrough was made by Oxford University researchers who studied men and women with a form of leukaemia.

They showed that a small proportion of the cancerous cells were extra-dangerous.  

The disease started in these stem cells.  The stem cells also made all the cells that made up the cancer – and were vital if it was to stay alive.

This is important because it means that a drug that kills the ‘mother cells’ could eliminate the disease.

The concept has been likened to getting rid of dandelions by pulling them out by the roots, rather than merely removing their heads.

Researcher Dr Petter Woll said: ‘We have identified a subset of cancer cells, shown that these cells are invariably the cells in which the cancer originates and are also the only cancer-propagating cells in the patients.

‘It is a vitally important step because it suggests that if you want to cure patients, you would need to target and remove these cells at the root of the cancer.  

‘But that would be sufficient, that would do it.’

 Dr Woll cautioned that new drugs take time to develop but added:  ‘Now we know that identity of these cells in this particular group of patients, the next thing is to try to understand the biology that makes them different.

‘Is there anything in that biology we can take advantage of to design a therapy that would allow their elimination?’

 The researchers studied one particular form of the blood cancer leukaemia.  However, they think the same principle likely applies to other types of the disease.

Professor Kamil Kranc, a Cancer Research UK stem cell expert based at the University of Edinburgh, said:  ‘This finding of rare human cancer stem cells in patients with a blood disorder that often develops into acute leukaemia is a huge leap towards understanding the roots of blood cancers.

‘Cancer stem cells have long been thought to be at the heart of many types of cancers but identifying these rogue cells has been a major challenge.

‘The next step will be to find specific drugs that eliminate these unique cells, which could be key to helping more people survive cancer.’
