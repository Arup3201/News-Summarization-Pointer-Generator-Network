Miss McManus alleged Derek Mitchell later dug his nails into the hand of 44-year-old Miss McGuire (pictured) when they sat at a table while the DJ was ‘holding court’ and telling a story

Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus spotted radio DJ Suzie McGuire’s husband grabbing his wife’s arm and calling her a ‘slut' as she hosted an event at a luxury hotel in Scotland, a court heard yesterday.

McManus said Derek Mitchell ‘looked angry’ when she and Miss McGuire, a presenter on Radio Station Clyde 1, were having photos taken with military personnel.

The singer and TV presenter told Paisley Sheriff Court she was ‘quite taken aback’ when Mitchell allegedly told his wife she was embarrassing him and that she was ‘behaving like a slut’ at the event in exclusive Mar Hall in Bishopton, Renfrewshire.

The star said she was ‘baffled’ when Miss McGuire – whose married name is Susan Mitchell – did not react.

Miss McManus was giving evidence on the first day of Mitchell’s trial. Accountant Derek Mitchell, 35, denies a string of charges including various assaults and breaches of the peace between March 2009 and October 2013.

He has lodged a special defence of self-defence for one of the charges.

Miss McManus alleged Mitchell later dug his nails into 44-year-old Miss McGuire’s hand when they sat at a table while the DJ was ‘holding court’ and telling a story.

Miss McManus told fiscal depute Amanda Gallagher that Miss McGuire was a work colleague she had met while filming the TV show Pop Idol.

She said Miss McGuire worked for a radio station and the court also heard the two women worked at corporate events together.

Miss Gallagher asked the witness if there were any occasions when she noticed anything ‘out of the ordinary’ with Miss McGuire.

Miss McManus said she knew Miss McGuire both as a single person and in a relationship and added: ‘There was one particular night where I noticed behaviour that I wouldn’t say was normal.’

The singer said they had been at an event in Mar Hall which Miss McGuire had been booked to host but as she was late the singer was asked to step in. She said when Miss McGuire and Mitchell arrived they were ‘a little bit flustered for being late but they seemed fine’.

The jury heard that after Miss McManus had performed at the event some of the military personnel there asked for pictures with the singer and Miss McGuire.

She said: ‘Suzie and I obliged, we spent about ten minutes with these guys getting pictures taken, they wanted selfies and stuff like that. At that point I kind of stepped aside to make a phone call or send a text message myself.

‘I noticed Derek coming towards where we had been standing and he looked angry.

‘He grabbed Suzie by the arm and said, “You’re really embarrassing me”.’

Miss McManus claimed Mitchell also told his wife: ‘You’re behaving like a slut, but then again you are a slut.’ She told the court she was ‘quite taken aback’.

Miss Gallagher asked: ‘What was Susan Mitchell’s reaction to what was said to her by Derek Mitchell?’

Miss McManus replied: ‘Nothing, there was no reaction, which was the most baffling thing for me.’

She also told the jury: ‘In my opinion it was almost like it was the norm.’

Miss Gallagher asked: ‘The lack of reaction was particularly striking to you?’ and the singer answered: ‘Yes.’

Miss McManus said that later she saw Mitchell and his wife sitting at a table, where the DJ was telling a story. The singer claimed at first she thought they were holding hands but ‘on closer inspection’ Mitchell was holding Miss McGuire’s hand.

Asked to describe what Mitchell was doing, she said his hand was on top of Miss McGuire’s and his nails were in the grooves between her fingers and he was pushing down on her hand.

She added: ‘Whatever he did to her hand stopped her from talking, she stopped the story.’

The trial before Sheriff Susan Sinclair continues.
