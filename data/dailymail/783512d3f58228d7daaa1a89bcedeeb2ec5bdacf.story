Selfie-loving Karen Danczuk has been trying her hardest to put a tough month behind her by doing what she does best - posing for the cameras.

Wearing a revealing luminous bikini, the wife of Labour MP Simon Danczuk settled into her Spanish sun holiday by taking a series of selfies, appearing to know she was in front of a photographer.

In a series of poolside shots, Ms Danczuk is seen rubbing suncream all over her body, before relaxing on a sun lounger, phone in hand.

The Labour councillor, who is due to stand down in May, is also seen emerging wet-haired from the swimming pool before casually strolling along the poolside.

The photographs were taken while on a four-day holiday in Costa Blanca with a female friend. They come weeks after she alleged that she had been repeatedly raped as a child.

A source told The Sun that Ms Danczuk had gone on the holiday to clear her head while the police investigation into her claims is ongoing. 

She was said to have read a lot of books and enjoyed some nice food during the break - while also spending time adding to her ever-expanding gallery of selfies.  

The source said: 'Everything had become a bit much for her and she's decided to go away for a few days and just get out of the country. It was just what Karen needed.' 

Last month, Ms Danczuk claimed in a newspaper interview that she had been raped hundreds of times between the ages of six and 12.

Ms Danczuk recently told how her selfies - many of which offer up an eye-watering view of her ample cleavage - were rooted in the abuse she allegedly suffered as a child

She told how her selfies were rooted in the abuse she suffered as a child and are a defiant way of reclaiming control over her alleged attacker.

‘They are my way of saying I am no longer ashamed, I’m saying, “To hell with you and to hell with what happened, I am sexy and good looking but you can’t have me. I’m in control now"', she said. 

A 36-year-old man was later arrested by Greater Manchester Police. He has vehemently denied the claims.

The mother-of-two shot to fame last year after posting dozens of  pictures - mostly showcasing her generous cleavage - to her 47,000 followers on Twitter.

Her public profile has grown steadily ever since with the images helping to propel her to the position of one of the most famous women in public life.

She has recently enlisted the help of Borne Media, an agency made up of a number of executives from Max Clifford’s former PR agency, including his daughter Louise, to look after her public image.

Meanwhile, Ms Danczuk's wife Simon, Labour MP for Rochdale since 2010, has this week been speaking out about an investigation into an alleged police cover-up over child abuse claims involving high-profile figures.

He is a vociferous campaigner against child abuse and those who cover up such crimes.
