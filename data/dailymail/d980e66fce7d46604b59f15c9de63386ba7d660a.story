Being born in to the Royal family assures a certain level of privilege, but while William and Kate's child will no doubt live a gilded life Britons have declared that they wish for the prince/princess to enjoy the freedom and challenges of a 'normal job'.

According to a report in the Evening Standard 65 per cent of people polled by Ipsos MORI would like the child to experience the working life of ordinary folk.

Perhaps the infant will follow in the footsteps of father-to-be William, who as a search and rescue pilot is one of the few royals to have any kind of 'real' job?

Or maybe the future heir will take after creative mother-to-be Kate, who enjoyed a short career in the fashion industry as an accessories buyer at Jigsaw in 2006 while the couple were still dating.

Despite wanting the Royal baby to earn its keep only three in 10 polled thought the child should attend a state school, with 50 per cent strongly disagreeing.

And seven in 10 agree with the statement that it will be 'impossible' for the child to have a normal upbringing.

The Duchess of Cambridge enjoyed a brief career in the fashion industry before taking on a full time role as a royal, which includes attending official events and patronages of several charities

The poll also found that one year after the Jubilee celebrations support for the Royal family remains strong.

Although not quite reaching the feel good factor of the summer of 2012 when 80 per cent of Britons declared their support for the monarchy, the Royal baby effect means that a huge 77 per cent of Britons questioned still counted themselves as monarchists. Only 17 per cent would like the UK to become a republic.

And the public seem to be softening towards grandfather-to-be, and the current heir to the throne, Prince Charles: only 35 per cent of those questioned thought that Charles should give up his right to the throne, with the majority - 52 per cent - wanting him to keep his place in succession.

Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORO said: 'The Diamond Jubilee is extending its halo, with support for the monarchy approaching all-time high levels.

'There is both sympathy for the challenges facing any children born to royalty but also a desire for Kate and William's child to experience more of a normal world of work.
