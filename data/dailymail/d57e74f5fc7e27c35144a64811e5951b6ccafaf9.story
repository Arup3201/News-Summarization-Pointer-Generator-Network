A former policeman stabbed his estranged wife to death at her hair salon in front of her horrified teenage colleague.

In the months before her killing,  Ivan Esack, 38, had chillingly told Natalie, 33, ‘You’re a dead woman walking – tick tock, tick tock’, a court heard yesterday.

He eventually fulfilled his alleged threat by knifing her up to 11 times in an attack that was so ferocious the blade bent.

Murder case: Ivan Esack, 38, knifed Natalie Esack, 33, at Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, in April up to 11 times with such ferocity that the blade bent and the tip broke off, Maidstone Crown Court was told

Mrs Esack’s 17-year-old salon 
assistant Chelsea Ford wept as she told how after the killing, Esack 
strode out on to the High Street, saying: ‘She deserved it, the bitch.’

Prosecutor Philip Bennetts described 
Esack as ‘a violent and controlling person who was unable to deal with 
the separation from his wife’ and killed her because he did not want her
to be with anyone else.

The court was told of this chilling exchange between Esack and his wife on the day before her death.

Esack: ‘I’ll catch up with you, don’t worry. You can’t ****ing hide from me, can you?’

Natalie: ‘What are my options?’

Esack: ‘Death, death or death.  You will see in the morning, and what I’m going to ****ing do to you won’t be funny.’

Cocaine-user Esack admits stabbing 
his wife but denies murder, claiming he is guilty only of manslaughter 
while his mind was unbalanced by ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ and
‘substance abuse’.

Maidstone Crown Court heard Esack and
his wife met around ten years ago and married in 2006. She later opened
Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, and counted Nancy Sorrell, 37, 
wife of comedian Vic Reeves, among her clients. Although she ran her own
business, Mrs Esack’s husband was bullying and controlling, the jury 
heard – never allowing his wife out without knowing where she was.

One Christmas a few years ago she 
suffered a badly swollen cheek and eye, Mr Bennetts said, after her 
husband punched her. In July last year Mrs Esack told a relative he had 
threatened her with a knife.

In October last year Mrs Esack left 
the marital home and went to live with her brother. Mr Bennetts said 
Esack then made such frightening threats to use his legally-held shotgun
to kill his wife, himself, and their dog, that she called the police.

Esack voluntarily handed over the gun but continued with his abuse and threats, the court heard.

During the separation, Mrs Esack 
began a new relationship but just before last Christmas was persuaded to
return to her husband after he broke down crying.

On Boxing Day, she went on a 
make-or-break holiday to Mexico with Esack – but returned with a massive
bruise on her thigh, saying he had kicked her.

The couple separated again and 
abusive calls continued, the jury heard. Some were recorded by Mrs Esack
and were played in court. Esack was heard saying: ‘You’ve signed your 
own death warrant’.

Matters came to a violent end in 
April after Mrs Esack went to a party with her new boyfriend and 
accidentally called her husband. He heard the pair talking and became 
aware of how serious her new relationship was.

The next day, the court heard, he 
bought a knife and went to her salon, stabbing his wife at the reception
desk. As she tried to flee, he grabbed her and continued to knife her 
in the back. The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
