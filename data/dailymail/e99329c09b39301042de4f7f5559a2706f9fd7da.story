A group of influential Conservative MPs are calling on the Chancellor to permanently grant small firms exemption from business rates

George Osborne is set to cut business taxes this week after Tory MPs called on him to ease small firms’ burden.

Some 37 influential Conservative MPs are publishing a report today calling on the Chancellor to permanently grant small firms exemption from business rates.

And last night Tory sources said Mr Osborne will heed their advice in his Autumn Statement on Thursday.

The MPs’ report says firms are still suffering from excessive regulation.

Last night, a Tory source said: ‘I understand there will be some action on this.’

The demand comes as leading Tories also called for income tax cuts and London Mayor Boris Johnson pressed the case for a one-off VAT cut on a new bridge in the capital.

The group of MPs, led by backbencher Kwasi Kwarteng, also call for councils to offer rate cuts to businesses who occupy empty properties. And the MPs said the threshold of taxable income at which firms have to register for VAT should rise from £79,000 to £100,000.

Small companies are completely exempt from business rates until March 31, 2014, on properties with a rateable value of £6,000 or less and get some relief on those whose rateable value is under £12,000.

Treasury sources said the Chancellor will have to ‘make a decision’ on what to do about business rate relief as it is due to expire next year. Insiders say it is likely he will extend it until the General Election.

But the MPs say it should be made permanent.

All shops and offices pay business rates, a tax for local services. The amount they pay is based on the rateable value of the property, roughly the amount those premises could have been let for at the last valuation in April 2008.

Small firms currently get a 100 per cent rebate on their business rates if their rateable value is under £6,000. This then tapers off until relief hits zero at properties with a rateable value of £12,000. MPs are calling for the rateable value threshold to go up to £14,000.

MP Kwasi Kwarteng is leading the group, which also call for councils to offer rate cuts to businesses who occupy empty properties

Those who have signed the paper include chairman of the Treasury select committee Andrew Tyrie and David Cameron’s envoy to the Indian community Prit Patel.

Mr Kwarteng said: ‘In preparing his Autumn Statement, George Osborne should consider how tough life is for many businesses. The combination of business rates and red tape is stifling people’s ability to drive the economy forward.’

The Free Enterprise Group report comes amid calls for cuts to personal taxation.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox said yesterday Mr Osborne should return to his pre-crash policy of ‘sharing the proceeds of growth’ – between measures to control the deficit and easing the cost of living for cash-strapped families.

Mr Osborne will also announce £30million of public money for the construction of a ‘garden bridge’ across the Thames.

Sources close to Mr Johnson say he is pressing Mr Osborne to give it a VAT exemption.
