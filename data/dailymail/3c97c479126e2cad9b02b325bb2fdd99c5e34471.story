Eulogised by William Wordsworth, Esthwaite Water is a mile and a half long and nestles in one of the most beautiful parts of the Lake District.

It is also going to be for sale on eBay for roughly the same price as an ordinary home – £300,000.

It is believed to be the first lake to go on the online auction site, which  is more often used to get rid of unwanted clothes or concert tickets.

Owner Nigel Woodhouse describes it as a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' as he prepares to retire.

Esthwaite Water, which lies between Lake Windermere and Coniston Water in Cumbria, is the first to be offered for sale on eBay

The lake's owner Nigel Woodhouse claimed it was the 'opportunity of a lifetime' for prospective buyers

The lake inspired William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter as they penned their literary masterpieces

He said: 'I chose eBay because I wanted to broadcast it to the world. The literary and natural importance of the lake is likely to attract an international audience so what better way to get the message out?'

Esthwaite Water covers 280 acres, straddling the villages of Near Sawrey and Hawkshead, and is the largest privately owned lake in Cumbria.

Mr Woodhouse said he wants to sell the lake and its established leisure businesses after 32 years in charge, as he approaches retirement age. 

'I will be sad to see it go; it has been my life,' he said.

The majestic expanse of water is mentioned by Wordsworth in his poem Expostulation and Reply and is the location for Lines Left Upon A Seat In A Yew-Tree - both feature in his Lyrical Ballads.

And Beatrix Potter's 'favourite lake' was the setting for the moment the children's author was inspired to create the popular character frog, Jeremy Fisher.

A licensed nature trail around the lake now pays homage to the famous literary figure behind the Peter Rabbit series.

Images painted by the author on the shores of the water hang in a studio nearby celebrating her work.

Mr Woodhouse said he chose to market the lake on the auction site because it is likely to attract prospective buyers from across the globe

'The nature walk provides for an informative amble from our car park up to the National Trust property of Hill Top, just 500m away,' Mr Woodhouse added.

The lake is the largest stocked fishing lake in the north west and acts as a trout fishery, attracting thousands to fish its shores each year - including one who caught England’s largest pike at 46.5lb.

Mr Woodhouse added: 'The site is of European importance and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

'It also has Ramsar status, which commends wetlands of international importance.

'We have had ospreys on site for 13 years and now offer a self-driven electric boat ride safari around the lake, taking in six different locations.'

Included in the 15-year lease from the Graythwaite Estate is the lake and land on the south west shore, a Victorian boathouse, fisherman’s lodge and shop. There is also a slipway and jetty for boats.

The auction will work on a best offer basis and Mr Woodhouse is available to show prospective buyers around.

Poet William Wordsworth drew inspiration from the beautiful landscape at Esthwaite Water

William Wordsworth was an English poet who helped to launch the Romantic age in English literature.

He was Britain's Poet Laureate from 1843 until his death in 1850.

Esthwaite Water is mentioned twice in Wordsworth's The Prelude at line 269: 'Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake'.

And again at line 570: 'From Esthwaite's neighbouring lake the splitting ice.'

The lake was also mentioned as the spot where Wordsworth spoke with a friend in his poem Expostulation and Reply, which made up part of the former Poet Laureate's Lyrical Ballards.

In the same collection, compiled with fellow romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the lake is the location for Lines Left Upon A Seat In A Yew-Tree.
