A solar flare was revealed in a NASA YouTube video on Thursday.

The Wednesday afternoon event was 'significant,' the space organization said in the video's description. 

'Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground,' NASA said. 'However -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.'

Beautiful! A solar flare was revealed in a NASA YouTube video on Thursday

Out of this world: NASA said the X.16-category flare was 'significant' 

Though the solar flare is blasting its way to Earth, the worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet and not cause many problems.

It has been several years since Earth has had a solar storm of this size coming from sunspots smack in the middle of the sun, Tom Berger, director of the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, told The Associated Press Wednesday. The flare on the sun barely hits the 'extreme' on forecasters' scale, but with its worst effects missing Earth it is only looking 'potentially strong' at most when it arrives at Earth as a solar storm, he said.

New calculations from satellite data show that the worst of the energetic particles streaming from the sun likely will go north or above Earth this time, Berger said late Wednesday.

So while the power grid may see fluctuations because the storm will cause changes in Earth's magnetic field, it won't knock power systems off line, Berger said. It may cause slight disturbances in satellites and radio transmissions but nothing major.

Solar storms occur often, especially during peaks in the solar cycle, and don't directly harm people.

'We're not scared of this one,' Berger said.

The storm is moving medium fast, about 2.5 million miles per hour, meaning the soonest it could arrive is early Friday. But it could be later, Berger said.

'There's been a giant magnetic explosion on the sun,' Berger said. 'Because it's pointed right at us, we'll at least catch some of the cloud' of highly energized and magnetized plasma that can disrupt Earth's magnetic sphere, which sometimes leads to temporary power grid problems.

On the plus side, sun flares expand the colorful northern lights so people farther south can see them. But don't expect them too far south, Berger said.

NOAA's National Weather Service Space Weather Prediction Center said a coronal mass ejection took place Thursday evening shortly before 7pm on Facebook. 

Accuweather.com reported Friday flares may be visible 'as far south as Maryland in the East and down over Nebraska farther west.' 

There may be storms Saturday, the Space Weather Prediction Center also said. 

Where can I watch? Accuweather indicated which areas of the US and Canada will be able to see the lights Friday
