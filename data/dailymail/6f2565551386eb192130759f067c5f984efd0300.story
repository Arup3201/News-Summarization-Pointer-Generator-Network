A Florida teen is fighting for her life after she was stabbed multiple times by a registered sex offender during a police chase.

Ashley Lyon, 16, from Valrico, went missing Friday, with her parents believing she was lured away by 41-year-old Steven Patrick Myers, who has twice been convicted of child molestation.

The pair were spotted at the Tiger Truck Stop near Grosse Tete, Louisiana, at about midnight Wednesday by a patron who recognized them from an Amber Alert.

The patron called the Iberville Sheriff's deputies who arrived to find Lyon and Myers in a Chevy 3500 flatbed pickup truck.

When Myers, who was driving, spotted the deputies he fled in the truck and a high speed chase ensued that stretched more than 40 miles to Lafayette, authorities said.Â 

Myers rammed four other cars during the chase, in what appeared to be an attempt to create roadblocks behind him.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, stop sticks eventually deflated his tires, however the criminal continued driving until his tires wore down to the rims.

When he finally came to a stop, he got out of the truck with a knife in his hand and started yelling at deputies to shoot him, deputies said. At some point he stabbed himself.

A police dog was then set on him and he was arrested.

Myers was treated for two self-inflicted stab wounds and bites from the police dog.

Lyon was found inside the truck with multiple stab wounds and was rushed to a Lafayette hospital.

She was listed in critical condition early Thursday.

'We don't have anything new,' Ashley's uncle Todd Lyon told the newspaper from her parents' home.

'When we get more information and we know Ashley's safe, that will be the time to communicate.'

Earlier this week, the teen's family revealed that she had exchanged thousands of text messages with Myers prior to her disappearance.
