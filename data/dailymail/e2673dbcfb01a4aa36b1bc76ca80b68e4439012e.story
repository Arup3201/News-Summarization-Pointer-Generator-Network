Financier: Mark Hawtin, who is hoping to add ti his property in Notting Hill, west London, is a director at investment management firm GAM

A wealthy financier’s plan to build a huge extension for a gym and kitchen in his £8million home by digging under a public road have been rejected after a campaign by neighbours including Ruby Wax.

Mark Hawtin wanted to add a second basement level to his five-storey house in Notting Hill, west London, by digging 5ft 9in out below a road - but neighbours called it an ‘unauthorised land grab’.

Boris Johnson’s sister Rachel joined U.S. comedian Miss Wax in protesting at the expansion and 25 residents signed a petition for the council to reject the application, reported the Evening Standard.

Neighbours feared it could cause 
flooding and that construction work would blight the area for months - 
and a planning committee turned down the proposals because of 
‘inappropriate’ designs.

But
this was in reference to the basement’s upper floor, which has led 
residents to raise concerns that a renewed bid from 50-year-old Mr 
Hawtin is still possible, reported the Evening Standard.

Ms
Johnson said she was ‘very pleased’ and that the planning committee 
‘refused the application on the grounds that they could refuse it on, 
but not on a lot of the other objections that were raised’.

Solicitor
James Mackay, 51, spoke against the plans at a meeting on Tuesday, and 
told the Evening Standard that the residents are concerned about where 
building under roads 'could all end'.

Stella Reed, 67, who is the next-door neighbour to Mr Hawtin, said: ‘We are all worried about a new application, but we just have to wait and see.’

Thomas Croft Architects, which is behind the plans, said the application was not rejected because of ‘subsidence or anything to do with the pavement’ and that no decision has yet been taken on an appeal or resubmission.

Mr Hawtin is a director at investment management firm GAM and currently lives in nearby South Kensington, central London. His wife said the family was unavailable for comment.
