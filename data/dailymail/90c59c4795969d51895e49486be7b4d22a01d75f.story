Public Advocate Bill de Blasio completed his surge from seemingly nowhere in New York City's mayoral primary Tuesday by taking a commanding lead on his Democratic opponents Tuesday, hovering near the threshold needed to avoid a runoff.

Former Metropolitan Transit Authority Chairman Joe Lhota easily won the GOP nomination, capping a chaotic primary to succeed 12 years of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The night also marked the unceremonious end to the bid by a City Council leader trying to become the first female and openly gay mayor, and to the political comebacks of scandal-scarred candidates Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer.

'We are better as a city when we make sure that everyone has a shot,' de Blasio told his Brooklyn victory party, emphasizing his campaign theme of combating income inequality. 'We begin tonight.'

With 94 percent of precincts reporting, de Blasio has about 40.02 percent of the total vote. He needs to stay above 40 percent in order to avoid triggering an automatic Oct. 1 runoff. If he cannot, he will face former city Comptroller Bill Thompson, who has 26 percent.

Council Speaker Christine Quinn was 
third at 15 percent, followed by current city Comptroller John Liu at 7 
percent and Weiner at 5 percent. Elections officials are expected to 
count an additional 30,000 or more votes in coming days as absentee 
ballots arrive by mail and paperwork comes in from voters who had 
problems at the polls. A final result may not be known for 10 days.

With
de Blasio so close to 40 percent, Democratic leaders may pressure 
Thompson to drop out in the name of party unity. But Thompson made it 
clear Tuesday that he wanted to contest the runoff.

'Three
more weeks! Three more weeks!' chanted Thompson, the party's 2009 
nominee, referring to the campaign sprint before the potential runoff. 
'This is far from over.'

De Blasio's rise in the race to succeed Mayor Michael Bloomberg was as sudden as it was unexpected.

Not
even two months ago, he was an afterthought in the campaign but surged 
in part thanks to an ad blitz that centered on his interracial family, 
his headline-grabbing arrest while protesting the possible closure of a 
Brooklyn hospital and the defection of Weiner's former supporters in the
wake of another sexting scandal.

Exit
polling showed the appeal of de Blasio, who holds the position of the 
city's official watchdog, to be broad-based: He was ahead in all five 
boroughs; was even with Thompson, the only African-American candidate, 
with black voters; and was ahead of Quinn, the lone woman in the race, 
with female voters. He also led Quinn, who is openly gay, among gay 
voters.

The voter interviews were conducted by Edison Media Research for The Associated Press and other news organizations.

The
winner of any runoff contest will face Lhota in the Nov. 5 general 
election. Lhota, ex-MTA chairman and former deputy mayor to Rudolph 
Giuliani, defeated billionaire grocery magnate John Catsimatidis for the
GOP nomination.

In the 
closely watched race for city comptroller, Manhattan Borough President 
Scott Stringer defeated Spitzer, who was seeking a return to politics 
after resigning New York's governor's office in 2008 amid a prostitution
scandal.

The winner of the
mayor's race in November will assume the helm of the nation's largest 
city at a critical juncture, as it experiences shrinking crime rates yet
widening income inequality, and as the nearly completed One World Trade
Center building symbolizes a new era after the terrorist attacks of 
2001.

Bloomberg, the 
businessman Republican-turned-independent, is completing his third term.
While the city's registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 6 to 1, the
GOP's recent success in mayoral elections has been largely attributed 
to a crime epidemic, the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks or other 
extraordinary circumstances.

Nearly
three-quarters of Democratic primary voters say the next mayor ought to
move away from Bloomberg's policies, according to the exit polls.

And
De Blasio, 52, has fashioned himself as the cleanest break from the 
Bloomberg years, proposing a tax on the wealthy to fund universal 
pre-kindergarten and changes to city police practices he says 
discriminate against minorities.

'I'm
a lefty and I've had enough of the righties,' said Jessica Safran, a 
business consultant from the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn who voted 
for de Blasio. 'Even if de Blasio moves to the center if he gets 
elected, he'll be closer to the positions I want than the others.'

All
the candidates were hosting election night rallies in venues across the
city. Each gathering went silent for 15 minutes when President Barack 
Obama addressed the nation on the situation in Syria.

Quinn
was the front-runner for much of the year, boasting the biggest 
campaign war chest and strong establishment backing. But she was dogged 
by her support to change term limits to let Bloomberg run again in 2009,
a decision unpopular with liberals who make up the bulk of Democratic 
primary voters.

Turnout 
appeared light, but the city's complaint line received several thousand 
voting-related calls. Many reported jams and breakdowns in the 
antiquated lever machines, which were hauled out of retirement to 
replace much-maligned electronic devices.

The
mayoral campaign was waged in hundreds of candidate forums and across 
millions of dollars of TV ads and was largely fought on the legacy of 
the Bloomberg era. Substantial policy differences were scarce among the 
Democrats, who agreed that the school system needed an overhaul, that 
the city's poor had been forgotten, and that stop-and-frisk police 
tactics used to stop suspicious people needed changing amid claims that 
police unfairly targeted blacks and Latinos.

Weiner
surprisingly entered the race in May after being in political exile 
since resigning from Congress in 2011 upon admitting to lewd online 
exchanges with women who were not his wife.

His
candidacy sparked curiosity and popular interest, and he immediately 
shot to the top of the polls. But support collapsed almost as quickly 
when he revealed in July that he continued the online behavior even 
after his resignation from federal office.

On
the Republican side, the candidates largely pledged to follow 
Bloomberg's lead, focusing on maintaining the city's record low crime 
rates. Lhota led the race from start to finish, fending off 
Catsimatidis' self-financed, unorthodox bid. Catsimatidis spent more 
than $4 million of his own money but was unable to stage a serious 
challenge.
