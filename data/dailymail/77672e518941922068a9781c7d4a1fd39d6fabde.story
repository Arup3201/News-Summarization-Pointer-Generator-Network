A Minnesota woman was sentenced yesterday to six months in a county 'workhouse' for allowing her special-needs daughter to be prostituted out to multiple men over a six-week period, one of whom got the 19-year-old woman pregnant.

In addition to the six months in the Ramsey County workhouse, Judge Gary Bastian sentenced 51-year-old Cheryl Tchida to a 185-day stayed sentence for two years probation after she pleaded guilty in April to neglect.

Tchida was charged in January after she repeatedly dropped her daughter - who has the mental capacity of a 5-year-old, an IQ of 45 and dwarfism - off at various locations to have sex with multiple men, even after the disabled girl told her she was being raped.

'Dropped the ball': That's how neglectful mother Cheryl Tchida summed up her decision to drop her special needs daughter off at motels where she was raped and impregnated

The initial incident happened on July 3, 2012, when Tchida dropped her daughter off at a motel in Roseville to 'hang out' with a 17-year-old male 'friend' she'd met at a fast-food drive-through a few days earlier.

Inside the motel, the disabled woman met her 'friend,' who had brought along his uncle and four other men. When the woman arrived, one of the men setup an online dating account through the website LiveLinks and began advertising the woman as a prostitute charging $200 per sexual act.

The teen - who can't tell time, read, or care for herself - later told police that she'd had sex against her will with five men that night; each time she said tried to say no, a man, identified in court documents first obtained by Pioneer Press, as 32-year-old Hasan Muhammad, told her he would harm her if she didn't do what the 'customers' asked.

The woman called Tchida for a ride following the night of repeated non-consensual sex. When Tchida called her back, Muhammad answered the phone and told her '[the woman] needs more chocolate and isn't coming home.'

Tchida never returned to the hotel to pick up her daughter.

According to the complaint, Muhammad then drove the woman to his apartment in St. Paul and had sex with her for the next several days.

Once he allowed her to leave, he sent the disabled woman text messages asking her to visit him again, which she did - with the help of Tchida.

Muhammad told the woman she needed to dress in shorts, a tank-top and high-heeled sandals for her next visit. Tchida then dropped her off at his apartment, and she was taken to a motel in Minneapolis and forced to have sex with multiple men, again for $200 per act.

According to the complaint, the teen reported the rapes to Tchida but she continued to drive her to Muhammad's apartment,

By August, Tchida learned that her daughter was pregnant, with the baby having been conceived in early July - and that's when she decided to call the cops and report the multiple rapes.

During a pre-sentencing interview, when asked about her failure to protect her disabled daughter, Tchida told the interviewer, 'yeah, I dropped the ball.'

The teen has since been placed in foster care because she requires round-the-clock care. The woman's daughter - who also was born with special needs - also has been placed in state custody.

At sentencing, Tchida talked about wanting to regain custody of her daughter, according to a Star-Tribune reporter who was in the courtroom.

Her plea was not received well by Judge Bastian.'You talk about wanting to be reunited with your daughter. To me...that would be the worst thing that could happen to your daughter,' Bastian said.
