Spain defender Juanfran has called for patience as former Atletico Madrid team-mate Diego Costa fired another blank in the shock 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifying defeat to Slovakia.

Costa has made an electric start to his Chelsea career with nine goals in seven games this season since signing for Jose Mourinho's side in the summer.

However the Brazil-born striker has now failed to score for Spain in six matches but Juanfran insists the under-fire forward will soon be scoring for the national side.

'He's not getting the scoring chances he's getting with his club team,' Juanfran told AS.

'He's committed and sooner or later he will start scoring goals. We need to be patient with him. On Sunday [against Luxembourg], everything will be fine.'

Juanfran stated he though the result, a first qualifying defeat for Spain since 2006, was harsh on Vicente Del Bosque's side.

Juanfran, whipping in a cross in Slovakia, has leapt to Costa's defence insisting he will fire in the goals soon

'Their goalkeeper had the game of his life. I truly don't believe we deserve to leave this stadium defeated,' he said.

'Sunday is a must-win game now. We are disappointed and we'll go over it again and again tonight (Thursday).

'But by the morning we'll find the way to take the positives out of our display and we'll look to take three points on Sunday. I don't think we'll treat this like it is the end of the world.' 

Spain surrendered to their first qualifying defeat in eight years, since losing 2-0 to Sweden in 2006
