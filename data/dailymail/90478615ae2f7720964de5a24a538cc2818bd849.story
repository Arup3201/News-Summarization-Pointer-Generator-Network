A four-year-old girl has become an ambassador for a new campaign - to help cure children like her who are robbed of the chance of growing up.

Aimee Lloyd has Retts Syndrome - a rare brain condition which affects only girls, slows down growth and reverses development.

It most often strikes youngsters just after they have learned to walk and say a few words and starts dragging their progression backwards. Over time they lose their new skills and are left  unable to communicate or use their
 hands to hold, carry or manipulate  objects.

Progressive condition: Aimee appeared to be a happy, healthy baby (left) but her parents became concerned when her development went into reverse. She was diagnosed with Rett's syndrome

Although most reach adulthood they lose their motor control essentially locking them into their bodies. Currently there is no cure for this cruel disease but Aimee's mother Jill, 36, has started a major fundraising campaign for research into the illness. She hopes a breakthrough will come in the next 10 years.

It is believed that Rett’s syndrome 
may possibly be the first reversible brain condition as symptoms have 
been successfully reserved in animals.

Presently Aimee is not able to 
sit unaided, speak or walk.

Jill, who runs a sandwich shop in Preston, said: 'It is basically a break-down of 
communication between her brain and her body. She also has no control 
over her hands - she’s constantly wringing them.

'There’s some fantastic research going 
on, especially the work of Professor Adrian Bird, who successfully 
reversed the syndrome in mice. We are hoping and praying every day they 
are one step closer to finding a cure. We’re not giving up hope.'

Jill, who also has a son called Daniel, 7, said the youngster was diagnosed just before her second birthday. Jill and Aimee’s dad, Justin Lloyd, 37, had alerted doctors after noticing slow development.

'Everything was normal during pregnancy,' she said.

'Daniel was six-and-a-half weeks early, so we thought she may come along early too, so they had me on steroids to build me up and she was just two weeks early.

'Everything was perfectly normal until her first birthday, she was a bubbly, happy baby who would wriggle around. The only thing was that she wasn’t sitting up on her own yet, but doctor said she would eventually catch up.'

But a few months later Aimee got a chest infection for a couple of weeks and during this time Aimee deteriorated significantly.

'She stopped doing everything she had done, so she would just lie there not moving. She was very placid; relatives said she was too good. Before she had been giggling and moving about. I thought she was maybe just weak, but I eventually took her to the GP,' she said.

Aimee was referred to Preston Royal hospital where Aimee’s muscle tone and bloods were tested.An MRI scan was also carried out, which came back clear, but doctors wanted to see Aimee again on receiving the results of her bloods.

On April 17, 2010, Jill and Justin were told the reason for their daughter’s slow development was Rett Syndrome, which only affects young girls.

She said: 'We had no idea what it meant, we had never heard of it. They said a cure for the disease would not be found during Aimee’s life.

'Of course we were devastated, it was our little girl. Nothing can prepare you to hear that she will never be able to look after herself, talk or walk and that there was no hope of her getting better - it was very very difficult.'

Aimee was born a few weeks early so her parents didn't worry about her slow development

Jill and Justin along with family and friends, have been trying to raise as much money to enable this research by Rett Syndrome Trust, to be continued.

Jill has trained and completed charity runs, whilst Justin and friends took on a Welsh peak challenge, raising £5,000.

More recently, girls and boys gathered in Preston for a fun walk dressed as super heroes and princesses in a bid to raise money.

Justin said: 'At times you just feel numb because this condition is like a bereavement. We lost our dream of having a healthy daughter and everything that goes with that - that one day I would walk her down the aisle, have grandchildren.

'The first few months she would cry at least three hours a day, but now she is such a happy little soul. She loves being around her grandma, who is always singing.

'Her favourite song is Rumour Has It by Adele, she loves Rihanna too. We never go anywhere without music. One minute she’ll be screaming and when we put on music, she’ll be beaming. She really is one of the happiest girls you will ever meet.'

Sufferers of the illness - including 
Coleen Rooney’s adopted sister Rosie McLoughlin - have small hands and 
feet and experience a 'deceleration' of the rate of head growth.

The
 illness was first described by Austrian pediatrician Andreas Rett in 
1966 and affects only girls as boys have different genes and male 
sufferers of the condition would rarely survive birth.
