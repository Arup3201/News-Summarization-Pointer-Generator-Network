Rafa Benitez's job as Napoli manager remains precarious after they were held to a home draw in front of a half-empty Stadio San Paolo crowd on Wednesday night.

The former Liverpool manager has inspired Napoli to just one win in Serie A so far and fans are frustrated by the club's lacklustre performances and failure in the Champions League group stages.

Benitez has managed in Naples since May 2013 but the Italian club sold just 17,000 tickets for the 3-3 draw against Palermo on Wednesday, a far cry from their 41,000 average attendance last year.

Jose Callejon put Napoli ahead on the brink of half time, but Belotti's second spoiled Benitez's night.
