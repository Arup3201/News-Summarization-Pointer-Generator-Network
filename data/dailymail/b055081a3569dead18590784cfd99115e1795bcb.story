It is not often a book is hailed 'the best book ever' - not least when the pages contain a collection of sketches of moody stick-men.

But the rave review by Sunday Times Style Magazine is just one of the accolades that's been bestowed upon the newly released cartoon book, A Decade in S***house.

In fact, the book, which is filled with crudely drawn figures displaying all manor of offensive and often downright rude behaviour, was a success before it even began.

The book became the UK’s second biggest ever comic crowdfunding success, exceeding their target within 48 hours of going live

Cult cartoonists and animators Modern Toss, made up of illustrators Jon Link and Mick Bunnage, received overwhelming support when they launched a crowdfunding campaign to create a coffee table book.

'If you want to see the last decade of our scurrilous comedy cult stuffed into a brand new collection then bung us a few quid or pre-order the book,' read the come-on on the Kickstarter website. 

The book became the UK’s second biggest ever comic crowdfunding success, exceeding their target within 48 hours of going live.

In all the duo, whose work features regularly in The Guardian and Private Eye magazine, received over £53,000 for the project

In all the duo, whose work features regularly in magazines, received over £53,000 for the project, well over twice their £20,000 target.

With 560 pages of classic cartoons and archive rarities, their subtly titled book ‘A Decade in the Sh**house’ has been eagerly awaited by their fans.

Have the duo received appreciative feedback? 'One bloke said he used our stuff to cheer his wife up who’s got a brain tumour,' Jon told MailOnline. 'You can’t get a better review than that.'

But despite the cult following and rave reviews, not everyone will find these crass-mouthed moody little men to their taste. On what side of the fence are you?
