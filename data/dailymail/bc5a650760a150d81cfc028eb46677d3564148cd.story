Ronny Deila plans to build his Celtic team around Scott Brown following the news that his skipper signed a new four-year deal on Thursday night.

The 29-year-old midfielder, brought in from Hibernian in 2007 in a reported £4.4million deal, has committed himself to the Scottish champions until 2018.

And Deila, speaking after the club's AGM at Celtic Park on Friday and ahead of the visit of Dundee in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday, underlined the importance of Brown, who also doubles as Scotland skipper.

'He's the captain and he has a lot of knowledge and skills that we need in this team,' he said.

'We want to build the team around him. He is a leader and he has the values that we want on the pitch.'

Brown, who is suspended for the Dundee game after being sent off at Aberdeen before the international break, does not envisage hanging up his boots when the new contract expires and claimed it would be 'amazing' if he could end his career at Parkhead.

'They offered me the deal and I jumped at the chance,' he said.

'It's a great place and to come her for another four years is great.

'I won't be hanging my boots up when the contract ends when I am 33, I will still have a few good years in me.

'It's just a great place to be - the fans, winning trophies, playing in the Champions League and Europa League, it's a great place.

'Everyone goes through hard times and the club stuck by me, so it's a little something back from me to stick by the club.'
