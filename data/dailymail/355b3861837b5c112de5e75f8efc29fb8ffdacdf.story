A Chicago mother says that officials at her daughter's elementary school ignored 'numerous' reports of bullying against the 12-year-old girl — eventually leading her to commit suicide.

McKenzie Phlipot, a student at Peirce School of International Studies, killed herself on May 8. Her mother, Beth Martin, is now suing Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Board of Education, charging that officials shared blame in the 12-year-old girl's death.

'The continued bullying that McKenzie suffered at school should have never been allowed,' Martin, whose suit seeks more than $50,000 in damages, said in a statement.

'McKenzie and I were relying on the administration to help us, but they ignored and dismissed the severity of the problem.

'They did not have McKenzie's back, she felt like she had nowhere to turn.'

Before her death in May, McKenzie made several comments about bullying on her social media accounts.

'Like if u hate bullies,' she wrote on her Instagram account in December. 

She wrote later: 'Look! All the bullies at my school need to stop talking.'

Four days before her death, she  made one final post on Instagram.

'If I died, would you cry? Would you wonder if I was happy?' she wrote ;Would I be on your mind? Would you ever speak my name again? Would you come to my funeral? Would you miss me?...

'Would your heart drop to your stomach when you found out that it was suicide?'

Chicago Public Schools have denied that there was any 'credible evidence' that McKenzie was bullied at school. Spokesman Bill McCaffrey on Thursday declined to comment on the lawsuit, DNAinfo Chicago reported.

McKenzie's dad, Travis Phlipot, on Thursday went to Peirce School and distributed flyers to parents asking: 'Does your child feel safe at school?'

'Mckenzie Phlipot didn't. Mckenzie was picked on, bullied by other students as well as a teacher,' says the flyer, signed by both parents, according to DNAinfo Chicago. 'Even after her mother complained, the bullying continued.

'She was shoved, punched and even required emergency room visits after being injured at school. One of her teachers repeatedly singled her out and treated her differently than other students.

'Her family's cries for help were ignored,' the flyer concludes. 'Nothing was done.'

The lawsuit, filed in Cook County,also alleges that the school failed to notify authorities of the bullying.

'I want McKenzie to have a voice, the one that went unheard while she was alive,' Martin said. 'I live with the pain of McKenzie's loss every day and want to help make sure no other child will have to endure the physical and emotional torment she experienced at school.'
