The Kansas City fan who swapped his season tickets to a Chiefs game for a wedding band set has proposed to his girlfriend, and the lucky lady said yes.

Rusty Jones, 49, popped the question to Janie Young-Tesch, 50, on Friday night after spotting an ad for the diamond engagement ring and wedding ring on Craigslist.

He said he met with the rings' owner, known only as Rachael, on Thursday and she handed them over in exchange for four tickets to the upcoming Chiefs Vs Broncos game.

And on Friday night, during a low-key evening at home, Jones gave the engagement ring to Janie, and asked if she'd marry him.

However, Janie may have had some inkling of Jones' intentions.

'I went to Cragslist and found the ad,' Jones told ABC News. 'I showed my girlfriend the pictures and asked her if she liked it.'

Obviously, she did, and the brilliant-cut diamond and white gold ring changed hands.

Jones said he has been a season ticket holder since 1993, and had purchased the tickets earlier in the year as part of the season package. He was more than willing to give up the tickets for the ring, which Rachael advertised as a 'nice diamond ring and wedding band' worth $3,100.

After Jones replied, the two agreed to meet at a jewelry store to verify the rings' authenticity.

The jewelers valued the set at $2,800, but it was close enough for Jones, whose tickets weren't quite as good as Rachael was originally after. The deal was sealed on Thursday.

When it came to the proposal, with the element of surprise gone, Jones decided a quiet night in was just the ticket.

Bling! Pictured are the wedding band and engagement ring an anonymous woman was offering to trade for football tickets on Craigslist last week

What an offer! This is the ad an anonymous woman posted to Craigslist on November 8 offering her wedding rings in exchange for tickets to a Chiefs game

'Our local paper had run a story 
about the purchase so I wasn't able to keep it a secret,' he said. 'She 
found out yesterday with all the hoopla. We just spent some time alone 
and asked her to marry me.'

Rachael was thrilled when she secured the tickets to the December 1 game.

'It's official! I have tickets to the game!!!' the Overland Park woman said.

The woman became an internet sensation after posting the unusual ad to Craigslist on November 8. It has since been deleted.

The
woman was after tickets to the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Denver Broncos 
game at Arrowhead on December 1 to surprise her husband on his 40th 
birthday.

She chose to hide
her identity because the post, which went viral, sparked a backlash 
from people criticizing her decision to trade the rings.Â 

What she didn't declare upfront was that they were from a previous marriage.

It's a deal! Rusty Jones (pictured) agreed to trade Chiefs tickets with the unnamed woman for her rings

'Will trade diamond wedding ring for Chiefs vs Broncos Tickets,' the original ad said, according to The Kansas City Star.

'I
have a nice diamond ring and wedding band set that was appraised at 
$3100 that I want to trade for Kansas City Chief tickets to the 12/1 
game...[I] will only entertain offers in lower or club level.'

According to the post, the item was a '14K white gold wedding set'.

The
engagement ring contained a round, brilliant-cut center diamond, .45 
carats, in a white gold setting. The wedding band contained 10 small 
round, full-cut diamonds weighing .25 carats.

'The ring holds no value to me,' the woman told FOXSportsKansasCity.com.

'And is a lot easier to part with over tickets than handing that much cash over for the tickets.

'I
tried to purchase tickets to the game about a month ago. I hit 
Craigslist and had someone accept my offer of $500 for two tickets.

'After
a number of attempts to schedule a meeting, he finally responded to me 
(a week later) that he had sold them to someone else. By then tickets 
were then selling for $400 each.

'We don't have that sort of money so my only option was to barter a wedding ring (from a previous marriage).'

The woman was elated when Rusty Jones, a Chiefs season ticket holder since 1993, accepted her offer yesterday.

Jones was identified by, and spoke with, The Kansas City Star, his local paper.

Jones
said he met the seller at Meierotto jewelers on Vivion Road Thursday, where he paid to have them appraised. They were valued at 
$2800.

The official 
trade was the ring set for four tickets to the December 1 Chiefs game 
and two tickets to the November 24 Chargers game, both in section 123, 
according to The Kansas City Star.

Jones, 49, said he and his girlfriend had started talking about engagement rings about a month ago.
