Tottenham fans should get down to White Hart Lane on a Thursday night. They should make an atmosphere, make it unplayable for the visitors and replicate the feel of those Champions League nights.

Why? Because by far their best chance of reliving them - those wins over Young Boys, Inter Milan, FC Twente and Werder Bremen - is winning the Europa League.

Every Europa League game from here on in is more important than the Premier League.

Managers will never admit to prioritising a cup over the league; some are bold enough to admit vice versa.

But for Mauricio Pochettino, their best chance of reaching the Champions League is by lifting the Europa League in Warsaw in May.

With Spurs’ quality individuals and strength in depth, the competition is winnable.

The Argentine boss has made 42 changes in their five European games so far this term, but don’t be fooled into thinking he has selected weaker teams.

He brought in Jan Vertonghen, Ben Davies, Emmanuel Adebayor, Andros Townsend, Harry Kane and Mousa Dembele on Thursday night after the 4-1 defeat to Manchester City. That’s six players with 197 international caps.

White Hart Lane was only 60 per cent full for the visit of Asteras Tripolis, but for £25 an adult, £5 a junior and a superb £50 family deal for four tickets, those who stayed at home missed out on value for money.

First, there was Erik Lamela’s ludicrous goal, surely the most skilful and audacious finish seen in this part of north London for years.

Then youngster Kane, proving once again he is a huge prospect (not between the sticks) with a striker’s hat-trick. Lamela’s blistering second and Hugo Lloris’ world class save, before being sent off, completed a night of superlatives.

Spurs fans were truly entertained for only the second time this season against the team who had previously topped the group, and qualification to the knockout stages should follow for Pochettino.

Their league form is less to shout about. Inconsistency has plagued Spurs in recent years, but the Europa League is a maximum 17-game tournament that essentially bypasses the rigours of the Premier League.

Of course, winning it is no simple task. Three of the last six winners had been filtered out from the Champions League group stages, and that is a road block still to come for those gaining confidence in the pre-knockout rounds.

But Spurs proved on Thursday night that when the nuts and bolts fit together, they’re a fine team to watch and unstoppable going forward. The fans must do all they can to believe the Europa League lifeline can be grabbed with both hands on the trophy.
