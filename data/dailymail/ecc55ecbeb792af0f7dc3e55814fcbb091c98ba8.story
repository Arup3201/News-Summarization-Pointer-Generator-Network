They have been a constant on motorways and building sites for more than two decades - and now the hi-vis jacket is heading for a fashion upgrade.

A modern take on the safety wear that makes garments visible from 1.5miles away in complete darkness has been unveiled.

The technologically-enhanced makeover of the building site staple uses a concealed battery to light up bright strips on the clothing that can be seen from long distances.

The technology uses a battery hidden inside the clothing which lights up reflective strips and can be seen for 1.5 miles

Fhoss, the company behind the clothing, is now making 5,000 products a month, including jackets, trousers and shoes 

Bosses at Network Rail, London Underground and infrastructure giant Balfour Beatty have already snapped up the items of clothing for use on their work sites.

Fhoss, the company behind the high tech clothing, claims its products could revolutionise workplace safety and save the lives of those working in dangerous situations.

Traditional hi-vis clothing uses reflective material that first requires light to be shone on it before it works. 

But by incorporating battery-powered strips on top of normal reflective material, the manufacturers claim that their jackets will be significantly harder to miss.

Wet weather also reduces the visibility of traditional clothing by up to 70 per cent, while the powered jackets do not lose any effectiveness in adverse conditions, it is claimed.

Andrew Kimitri, the man behind the company that started in November last year, has patented the technology and has his eyes on claiming a large stake of the multi-billion personal protective equipment market.

The Weston-super-Mare business is already producing 5,000 pieces of clothing a month and has designed trousers and shoes that also use the technology.

Inventor Andrew Kimitri initially thought of the product as a way to make doormen at hotels, bars and nightclubs to stand out

The clothing uses electroluminescent technology connected to a battery that provides 15 hours of light before recharging.

A hidden battery in the clothing lights up bright strips on normal reflective material that can be seen up to 1.5miles away.

The battery, connected to electroluminescent technology, provides 15 hours of continuous light.

Unlike normal hi-vis clothing, the products are equally effective in adverse weather conditions.

The clothing can also be machine washed 25 times - 15 more than standard hi-vis. 

Mr Kimitri, 40, initially thought of the idea while working in the hotel industry and nightclub industry.

He said: ‘I’ve spent 20 years running hotels, bars and nightclubs. Doormen don’t tend to stand out; they look like anyone. I wanted to help distinguish the security personnel in case of an emergency.’

Mr Kimitri spent three years developing the idea, eventually realising that the concept easily leant itself to the safety clothing industry.

He said: ‘High–vis clothing hasn’t changed for 20 years. The main achievement was to get a battery on a man.

‘When I started the business, a rival asked, "Are you the fool that wants to put lighting onto a high–vis vest?"'

After securing £750,000 in funding, the company is already enjoying success and is importing products to America, Australia and Europe.

The businessman also said that he envisages runners and cyclists using the technology in the future, with the company hoping to make a turnover of £3million this year.
