Lothar Matuschak, Schalke’s veteran goalkeeper coach, was expecting a promising 14-year-old by the name of Manuel Neuer but did not recognise the callow youth who turned up at his door clutching a pair of gloves.

‘I didn’t realise he was the goalkeeper they meant because he was so small and his voice was so high,’ recalls Matuschak. ‘From a physical point of view, he was the opposite of a goalkeeper.’

When Schalke considered letting Neuer go shortly afterwards, however, Matuschak had already seen enough to know they were making a big mistake. ‘Don’t do it,’ he said. ‘One day Manuel will be the best in the world.’

Matuschak’s prediction has come true and on Sunday night, in the iconic Maracana Stadium, 28-year-old Neuer hopes to get those famous hands on the World Cup. He has been the outstanding goalkeeper of the tournament, brilliant against Algeria and Brazil, unbeatable against France. Now it’s the turn of Lionel Messi and Co to try and find a way past Germany’s imperious 6ft 4in ‘sweeper keeper’.

Alongside Neuer in Rio will be Mesut Ozil, Benedikt Howedes and Julian Draxler, three other graduates of Gesamtschule Berger Feld comprehensive who went to school in the shadow of Schalke’s old Parkstadion.

Neuer could see it from the window of his house in the Buer district of Gelsenkirchen. He was given his first ball at the age of two and had signed up for Schalke when he was four, initially as a striker.

‘The coach put me in goal and back then we were playing on bone-hard ground,’ he recalls. ‘Red ash, we even trained on black ash, which was worse.

‘That’s not easy for a goalkeeper. My mother was always taking out her sewing kit for the countless holes in my training pants. For a long time I had to buy my own gear.

‘I used to cry when I let in a goal. I always thought I was to blame because I was the last man.’

Neuer, a promising tennis player until he gave up the sport in favour of football at the age of 14, has developed an altogether tougher mentality over the years.

Former German international Mehmet Scholl refers to him as Icecube Neuer and Andreas Kopke, Germany’s goalkeeper coach at this World Cup, believes the Bayern Munich star is one of the finest exponents of nervenstarke — strength of nerve. ‘This is the quality that makes him stand out,’ says Kopke.

‘If something goes wrong for him during the game, he can put it aside immediately. Analysis can wait.

He embodies exactly the goalkeeper we want to see in the national team. He’s not only an excellent keeper, but also a good footballer who can participate in the build-up play.’

If Neuer isn’t keeping the ball out of
 his goal — the nonchalant one-handed block from France’s Karim Benzema 
in the quarter-finals was reminiscent of Robocop deflecting a bullet — 
he is charging out of his box to break up an attack or venturing forward
 with the ball. A sweeper keeper, the penalty area is just a white line 
drawn for the benefit of others.

‘My
 role model was Edwin van der Sar who played that way when it was 
unusual,’ says Neuer, who was also a big admirer of former Schalke and 
Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann. ‘The game has changed. I want to help and 
support the team, even if it’s with my feet.’

Neuer’s brother Marcel, who is one year younger, is a referee who officiates fixtures up to the fourth tier of German football.

Neuer will be operating on a different level against Argentina. The hopes of a nation could rest on his shoulders.

‘He has proven at this World Cup that he is the world’s best goalkeeper,’ says Germany’s legendary keeper Oliver Kahn.

‘Everyone knows he is a wonderful footballer but what is crucial is that in important situations he can rescue the win. That is what he’ll be measured by.’
