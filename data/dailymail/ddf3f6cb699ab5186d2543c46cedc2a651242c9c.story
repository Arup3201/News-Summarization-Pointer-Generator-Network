Britain’s top 10 benefits claimants were paid on average  more in handouts than someone earning over £85,000, it can be revealed.

Average welfare payments to 10 families were worth on average more than £1,100-a-week before a cap on payments was introduced.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he was determined to end the ‘ludicrous situation’ where people on benefits had a higher income than the average wage of someone who goes out to work.

Latest figures show that between April 2013 and March 2014, 42,252 households were affected by the benefit cap, which limits welfare payments to £500-a-week

The figures mean the 10 highest benefits claimants an average each week - higher than the gross weekly pay of dentists, accountants and teachers and almost as much as a senior police officer 

The benefits cap is set at £500-a-week, or £26,000-a-year - chosen by ministers because it is close to the average pre-tax wage of someone in work.

The new figures relate to the amount households were able to claim before the cap was introduced. The largest sums are likely to have been driven by large claims for housing benefit. 

More than 42,000 households have seen their benefits cut since the cap came into force in April last year.

Until now the Department for Work and Pensions had only said that 96 had been receiving more than £900-a-week.

Officials has refused to release details of each of the highest claimants to protect their identity.

But now ministers have confirmed that the average payment amount the top 10 claimants had been capped by was £607.

This means that on average they were receiving £1,107-a-week, or £57,564-a-year.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the government was ending the 'ludicrous situation' of people on benefits receiving more than average workers' incomes

The benefits cap covers Housing Benefit, Income Support, Incapacity Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance.

Severe Disablement Allowance Other payments included are Bereavement Allowance, Carer’s Allowance, Child Benefit, Child Tax Credit, most Employment and Support Allowance,Guardian’s Allowance, Maternity Allowance.

With the data only providing the average for the top 10, the figure for the highest recipients is likely to be much higher. 

Someone on an annual salary of £85,000 would have take-home pay of only £56,444.

According to the Office for National Statistics, a dentist's pre-tax pay is £972-a-week, a chartered accountant £716.90 and a secondary school teacher £644.10. 

Mr
 Duncan Smith told MailOnline: ‘The benefit cap has addressed the 
ludicrous situation we were in where people were receiving far more in 
benefits than the ordinary hardworking family earns.

‘It is not right that before we introduced it some families could rake in more than double the amount that the average taxpayer takes home.

‘By limiting the amount any household can receive to £26,000 a year we are restoring fairness to the system.

‘Our reforms are helping people move off benefits and into work, and already we have seen that more than 100 people affected by the benefit cap have moved into work every week on average since its introduction.’

The benefit cap is set at £500 a week for couples, with or without children, and single parents. An adult living alone is limited to £350-a-week.

Latest figures show that between April 2013 and March 2014, 20,088 families received between £500 and £550 in benefits, meaning they lost £50 under the cap.

A further 11,583 were capped after receiving £550-£600 and 5,311 were given £600-£650. Overall 96 received £900-a-week or more, equivalent to £46,800-a-year.

Earlier this year, MailOnline submitted a freedom of information request asking for the top 10 households by the amount they have been capped by per week, giving the amount each had been capped by and the region they live in.

The figures show that most families hit by the benefits cap live in London and the South East

But the Department for Work and Pensions refused, insisting it is a ‘criminal offence to release Social Security information relating to an individual without lawful authority to do so’, even though the request had not asked for the names of the people affected.

Since then Tory MP Charlie Elphicke asked a parliamentary question for the ‘highest amount is that a single household has been capped as a result of the benefit cap’.

Employment minister Esther McVey replied: ‘Of the top 10 highest capped households at the end of March 2014, the average capped amount was £607 per week.’
