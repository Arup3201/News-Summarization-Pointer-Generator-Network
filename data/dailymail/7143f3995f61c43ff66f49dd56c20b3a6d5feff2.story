Surprise! Drivers were showered in 3,000 ping-pong balls on Interstate 15 in Idaho

Freeway drivers were showered in ping-pong balls when a pilot dropped 3,000 on the highway by mistake.

The balls were meant to be dropped on a crowd for the grand finale of a two-day city pride fair in Blackfoot, Idaho, and could be exchanged for prizes worth up to $100.

But the pilot who was tasked to make the drop overestimated their momentum - prompting what was described as a dangerous scramble by revellers as they ran out into the road.

Organizers immediately called off the contest on Saturday night, which was the final event for Blackfoot Pride Days.

The city of 12,000 people had put on a string of events to celebrate local pride, including a greased watermelon contest and cheap tours around the Idaho Potato Museum.

But attendees had to be instructed not to run onto the highway with the promise that the prizes would be handed out despite the mishap.

One resident, Sarah Taylor, told the Idaho State Journal: 'It was ridiculous. Kids and adults were actually running out on the freeway to get the balls.'

She
 added: 'You could hear them popping as people ran over them. People 
needed to realize that's a dangerous situation. I'm glad nobody got hit 
and there was no accidents.'

The ping-pong ball drop had taken place for more than a decade and most of the balls were redeemable for small prizes including sweets.

The highest-ranking ones could be swapped for $100 gift certificates.

Aaron Moon, an organiser of the event, said a new pilot attempted the drop this year and misunderstood how the balls would fall.

Instead of being carried by the momentum of the plane or blown in the wind they lost speed and dropped down together, he said.

The day was not a complete write-off, however - it also included free fishing, a 'safety fair' and free potatoes for all.

Blackfoot Police Chief Kurt Asmus told the Journal no charges would be filed, but police plan to work with the organizers more closely next year.
