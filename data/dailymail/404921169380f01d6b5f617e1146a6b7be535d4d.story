A man hunting whitetail deer in Kansas last week thought he'd bagged an 8-point trophy buck he could show off back home in North Carolina.

Chuck Rorie was right about one thing: the deer sported an impressive rack, but it wasn't a buck . It was a doe.

Rorie realized his understandable mistake while skinning the animal. 'It didn’t have the right private parts,' he told the Wichita Eagle.

Rorie, who calls Monroe County, North Carolina home, had stumbled upon a very rare antlered doe--a 1 in 10,000 phenomenon the occurs when a female deer has an overabundance of testosterone.

'It didn’t have the right private parts': Chuck Rorie killed what he thought was an 8-point trophy buck on Wednesday. When he skinned it, he realized it was actually a 1 in 10,000 antlered doe

'I’m tickled to death. I know this is a once in a lifetime thing,' he told the Eagle.

Rorie's kill was made especially rare by the high quality of the deer's antlers. More often than not, an antlered deer has an off-looking rack with lots of points growing in all directions.

And more common than that, most antlered deer never lose the velvet that covers male antlers through the spring because they lack enough testosterone to drive them to rub off the covering.

'You could see tree bark on the antlers where she’d been rubbing them against trees, like a buck,' he said.

Rorie told the Eagle that, at least at first blush, the deer looked like any normal buck as he lined up to shoot it at the edge of a hay field.

It was with a group of other bucks that were chasing a group of does as potential mates.

He didn't notice at the time that his deer lacked the necks swollen for mating season that the other bucks sported.

The other does knew, though. '[It tried] to follow the does around, but they wanted nothing to do with her,' he said. 'I guess they saw the antlers and just assumed.'

Doe or not, though, Rorie plans to mount the impressive rack like any other.
