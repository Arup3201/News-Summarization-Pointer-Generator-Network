Education Minister Christopher Pyne may have called one of his political opponents the 'c-bomb' on national breakfast television if popular euphemisms are anything to go by. 

Mr Pyne appeared opposite Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese on Channel Nine's Today show on Friday to field questions about leadership speculation within the Liberal party. 

Despite being pressed repeatedly by host Karl Stefanovic, Mr Pyne wasn't able to confirm if Prime Minister Tony Abbott had the numbers to maintain leadership of the Liberal party ahead of next Tuesday's party room meeting.

The conversation between Mr Pyne and Mr Albanese appeared to be civilised until the interview started wrapping up and a cheeky dig was made about the government's current leadership crisis. 

'See you with a new leader next week,' Mr Albanese quipped.

Mr Pyne instantly shot back: 'See you next Tuesday'.

The phrase, C U Next Tuesday, is a common euphemism of the word c**t.

The dig  was made after Mr Pyne was asked if the Prime Minister would still hold the top job next Wednesday and if a vote would be held about the Liberal leadership.

Mr Pyne told Mr Albanese he would 'See you next Tuesday' - a common euphemism of the word c***

'I assume that the party room knows that the worst thing we could possibly do is change leadership right now. We have to support the PM,' he said.

'I've been supporting him very strongly in the past 10 days while this has been going on. I have been doing as much media as I possibly can, as I am this morning, because I believe that he remains the best person to be leader of the party.' 

If Mr Pyne intentionally used the 'see you next Tuesday' phrase in the way many perceived, it wouldn't be the first time.

He was accused of calling Labor leader Bill Shorten a 'c***t' in parliament last year.

He was also accused of calling Labor leader Bill Shorten a 'c***t' in parliament last year, despite saying he only used the word grub

Mr Shorten looked surprised by the outburst and gestured at Mr Pyne while looking at Speaker Bronwyn Bishop.

Ms Bishop responded by saying: 'The minister will refer to people by their correct name.'

Mr Pyne responded: 'I will, Madame Speaker. I withdraw.'

A spokesman for the Education Minister said he used the word 'grub', but it caused outrage on social media nonetheless.
