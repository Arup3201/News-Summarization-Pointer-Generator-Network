A British holidaymaker who went on a cruise while recuperating from throat cancer treatment says his trip was ruined after he was struck down with gastric illness.

Robert Keywood, from Mexborough, South Yorkshire, was travelling on the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship with his wife, Verena, to get some rest and relaxation after undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

But the 53-year-old said he was forced to remain in his cabin while experiencing stomach cramps, fever, diarrhoea, aches, lack of appetite and severe lethargy.

Robert Keywood said he fell seriously ill on board the Cunard-owned Queen Elizabeth cruise ship

Mr Keywood experienced gastric illness symptoms during a ten-day cruise from Singapore to Dubai

Mr Keywood, a steel engineer, fell ill while sailing from Singapore to Dubai over ten days in April 2014 and has instructed solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to investigate his claims.

He said: ‘This was meant to be a holiday where my wife and I could relax and take it easy. I had been having treatment for throat cancer and we just wanted to get away and enjoy ourselves.’

He claimed food was served lukewarm, fruit was not always fresh, the pool water was dirty looking, and public toilets wouldn’t flush properly aboard the Cunard Line vessel.

Robert and Verena Keywood said conditions on board the ship were below the standards they expected

He said water was dripping from the ceilings in the dining rooms and buckets were used to catch the drops.

Robert said: ‘We were very disappointed to see that the conditions were well below the standard we expected.

‘You just don’t expect to get ill when you’re booking a holiday. The cruise was only for ten days but I spent most of it being ill and feeling weak and was still not feeling right when we returned home.’

Robert said the ship’s captain announced that more than 80 passengers were ill on board the ship.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Cunard Line said: 'Norovirus is the most common cause of stomach bugs in England and Wales and according to Public Heath England outbreaks are common in semi-enclosed environments such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools, restaurants and hotels.

'All our ships have stringent ongoing cleaning and hygiene policies in place as part of normal operations and if there is an occurrence of illness on board we then implement comprehensive disinfection protocols, developed in conjunction with UK and international health authorities.

'We confirm we have been contacted by Mr Keywood’s legal advisors and we have provided our response, but we cannot comment further on individual cases.'

Clare Pearson, a specialist international personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which is representing Mr Keywood, said: ‘Although a number of passengers were reported to have suffered illness during the cruise on board the Queen Elizabeth, Cunard has denied liability for the illness experienced by Mr Keywood and claim that they followed the very strict health and safety guidelines set down for cruise operators to prevent the spread of illness.

‘The exact cause of the illness Mr Keywood suffered and whether it was contracted on board the ship has not yet been established and we are now supporting him in his quest for answers as to what caused him to fall ill.

‘As part of this investigation we will seek to determine whether more could and should have been done to prevent Mr Keywood from becoming ill.’
