When Yohan Cabaye called his childhood friend Mathieu Debuchy a year ago to sell Newcastle United to him, he knew the fans would help seal the deal.

An ardent follower of the Barclays Premier League, Debuchy knew all about the club when they came calling in Lille. Ginola, Robert, Ben Arfa and Shearer all resonated with the defender, but the inside track from his trusted ally helped make his mind up.

‘I already knew about Newcastle and that many French players had played for them,’ Debuchy recalled. ‘And other great players like Alan Shearer. I knew Newcastle were one of the best teams in this country.

‘Yohan told me the club were fantastic but above all he talked about the fans and that convinced me to come straight away.’

Only from Saturday, when Newcastle welcome Sunderland for the 149th Tyne-Wear derby, Cabaye is no longer there after sealing his own January transfer to Paris Saint-Germain this week.

Newcastle will miss the midfielder but Debuchy, whose family shared meals and days off with the Cabaye clan, will feel his absence most.

Those same fans will also feel aggrieved at the sale, no matter what the financial benefits.

Cabaye’s £20million fee was not touched before the transfer window closed on Friday night.

‘He will be a miss for the team,’ Debuchy said. ‘He was an extraordinary player and we were friends but we have other talented players. He will miss the Newcastle supporters, I know that.’

Debuchy started in goal when he began kicking a ball at the age of four in Fretin, his small village near Lille.

It did not take long before he played outfield with his older brother Gregoire — who also became a Lille junior  — and their friends on a makeshift pitch or in the street.

‘I was a good keeper but I wanted to get on the ball more,’ he said. ‘I wanted to play in every position but Patrick Vieira was my favourite so I usually played as a defensive midfielder.’

Union Sportive Fretin signed him and he joined Lille’s academy at the age of eight.

He didn’t leave until Newcastle paid £5.5m for him a year ago.

Things could have been very  different. Three years before his Lille debut, Debuchy suffered a cruciate- ligament injury in training at the age of 15.

It was a life-changing episode which required the support of his  parents Jean-Pascal and Dominique, as well as his older brother.

Debuchy said: ‘I was young, I wasn’t a professional footballer and I had nothing to fall back on. I hadn’t achieved anything but to become a professional footballer, that is what I wanted more than anything.

‘Fortunately, the club looked after me and I had the support of my parents and my brother and my future wife Ludivine. I worked hard to get back over six months.

'It was a serious injury and it was hard work. When I did my other knee I was in Ligue One and 22. I was prepared.’

His parents may not have approved at the time, and Debuchy’s wife has her own reservations now, but it was during that lay-off as a teenager that Debuchy had his first tattoo.

He has lost count of them all now but his entire left arm and most of his back are covered.

He has the names of his children Lalou, Lukas and Manon on each leg and the bottom of his back. It is all the work of a friend from Lille.

Debuchy said: ‘Everyone has their own desires on what they want on their body. I just feel a real need to be able to express what I feel — and on my body it is tattoos.

‘There is the fashion side to it but the majority are about my religion and my family. They have meaning. I am going to continue getting more but my wife may not like it. She has a few of her own but thinks I have enough.

Softly spoken and still lacking the confidence to conduct this interview in English, Debuchy is far removed from the man who went wild when he scored in the Stadium of Light derby in October.

There have been grumblings about the dearth of Geordies coming through at Newcastle but Debuchy insists the academy, part-funded by club sponsors Wonga, is vital.

He said: ‘It is important they help local players become professionals. The fans want to see local players in their team.’ 

In pole position: Debuchy is currently keeping Arsenal Bacary Sagna out of the France national team and looks a good bet to keep his place for the World Cup

Debuchy, who is keeping Bacary Sagna out of France’s starting XI, plans to be reunited with Cabaye for the World Cup in Brazil.

‘It would be wonderful but nothing is certain,’ he said. ‘I will do everything I can to be there but Sagna is a fantastic player. The most important thing is France has a good World Cup.’

But before that is the derby. ‘I’ve had two (derby) defeats since I came and even scoring in one can’t make up for that. I want to put that right.’

As a proud partner of Newcastle United, Wonga are investing over £1.5m in the club’s academy. Read more about their work at www.wongafootball.com/nufc
