Part of the International Space Station was dramatically evacuated on Wednesday after an alarm warned of a possible leak of toxic ammonia.

Crew members in the US section of the station were forced to take refuge in the Russian part of the ISS while the problem was being investigated.

But later on Wednesday the crew were able to return to the US modules after it was revealed that the reading was a false alarm, letting the astronauts and cosmonauts return to life as normal.

Part of the International Space Station (pictured) was dramatically evacuated Wednesday after a possible leak of 'harmful' ammonia in the US section, forcing astronauts to flee. However, Nasa said the leak was likely just a faulty sensor reading, and the crew were able to move back later on Wednesday

The Russian Space Agency, Roscosmos, had said a possible 'escape of hazardous substances from an air conditioning unit' was discharged into the station's atmosphere at around 8.45am GMT (3.45am EST) on Wednesday.

Following an alarm, the six crew members aboard the ISS were told to don masks and take refuge in the Russian segment of the station.

They then closed the hatch to the US segment to prevent leaking ammonia - which could be hazardous to the health of the astronauts - from contaminating the rest of the station. 

By Wednesday afternoon, the astronauts were back in the US part of the orbiting outpost.

'Hey everybody, thanks for your concern,' Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti said via Twitter. 'We're all safe & doing well in the Russian segment.'

Ammonia on the ISS is used to cool the station as part of the Active Thermal Control System.

It is circulated in loops on the exterior of the ISS and moves through the large radiators on the exterior of the station, releasing heat from them into space.

Although extremely useful as a coolant, ammonia is also poisonous to breathe - and thus a potential leak could be a serious health concern for astronauts on board.

The 'unscheduled excitement,' as Nasa called it, occurred around 9am GMT (4am EST), well into the station crew's workday.

As alarms blared, the astronauts followed emergency procedures in slapping on oxygen masks, taking cover in the Russian quarters, then sealing the hatches between the U.S. and Russian sides.

At the same time, flight controllers at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston turned off non-essential equipment.

Within minutes, Mission Control gave an all-clear, but sent the astronauts scurrying back over to the Russian side again when there was more evidence of a possible leak of the coolant.

The highly toxic liquid ammonia, flowing outside the space station, is used to cool electronics. 

Flight controllers originally feared it had gotten into the water system running inside. 

Now, it's believed that a failed card in a computer-relay box was the culprit. 

'The American segment on the ISS is currently isolated. The crew is safe and located in the Russian segment,' Roscosmos said in a statement at the time of the discovery.

An official added: 'The crew's safety was provided for thanks to the co-ordinated and quick actions of the cosmonauts and astronauts themselves, as well as operative control groups in Moscow and Houston.'  

The current crew on board the ISS had to take refuge in the Russian part of the station after a possible ammonia leak this morning.

The crew of the ISS are currently in the Russian modules of the ISS, shown here in red. The US parts of the station, shown in yellow, may have an ammonia leak, causing them to be evacuated - but this has not yet been confirmed. Note the Science Power Platform shown here is an addition to the ISS that was never launched

The entire crew of Expedition 42 are now seeking refuge while ground controllers at Nasa and elsewhere figure out the extent of the problem.

Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998.

It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three.

The station orbits at a height of about 264 miles (425km).

It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house.

It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour.

It has now been in space for more than 5,800 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. 

According to Russian Mission Control an unscheduled spacewalk may have been required to fix the leak - but this is not likely to be needed now.

This would not have been the first time an ammonia leak has been fixed by a spacewalk, though. Back in 2013 two astronauts had to plug a leak outside the station. 

In the event that an evacuation had been needed, the crew would have been required to get into the two Soyuz spacecraft currently docked to the ISS and return to Earth.

The chances of this being required, though, were extremely low.

The latest emergency comes after recent hints from Russian officials that they could abandon the ISS in 2020 despite a US desire to see the station continue until 2028.

Russia is thought to want to end its involvement in the ISS to begin construction of a new space station that it will use as a gateway to the moon and possibly other destinations.

On the right is Russian cosmonaut Elena Serova, born on 22 April 1976 in Vozdvizhenka, Russia. This is also her first flight to space
