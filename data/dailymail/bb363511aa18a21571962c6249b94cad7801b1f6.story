Charged: Jeffrey Coley, 50, is accused of robbing a South Carolina KFC and leading police on a dangerous chase

A man fired from a chicken shop is accused of robbing a KFC before leading police on a dangerous chase through South Carolina.

Jeffrey Coley, who was fired from his $8.50/hour Chik-fil-A job on June 18, allegedly threatened drive-thru workers with a handgun and demanded cash on Monday. He fled in a Plymouth Neon with just $516.02.

After eluding police for a day, officers spotted the 50-year-old driving his car near the Taylor St and Crawford Rd, Rock Hill intersection on Tuesday.

The father-of-one allegedly didn't stop when police turned on their sirens, leading officers on a high-speed chase down Dave Lyle Boulevard where he allegedly crashed into another car.

The pursuit continued through the northern end of the city before cops used stop sticks, causing Coley to crash into a ditch on Cel-River Rd.

Police told Charlotte Observer they found the cash drawer and less than a gram of methamphetamine in Coley's car when he was arrested.

He was charged with armed robbery, possession of a 
firearm during a violent crime, possession of methamphetamine and 
failure to stop for a blue light.

Coley told the court on Wednesday morning that he worked 40 hours a week at Chick-fil-A 
in Indian Land to support his unemployed wife and daughter, Herald Online reported.

He said he lived with his mother in
 Charlotte, North Carolina for the last year-and-a-half after his 
pastor father died, and that he owns a $28,000 property in Fort Mill, South Carolina.

Rock Hill Municipal Court Judge Dolores Williams denied Coley bond.

Meanwhile Chick-fil-A spokesman Mark Baldwin told Herald Online that Coley was sacked on June 18 after he failed to show up to work for two days.

Coley did not mention his termination in court.

Norman Dobson, KFC area manager, told the court that the two employees held at gunpoint are still traumatized.

'Neither one of these young ladies has worked since the incident,' Dobson said.

'They’re terrified; they’re not getting a good night’s sleep. He’s turned their lives upside down...they’re out there trying to make an honest living and this is what they got.'

Dobson also said that Coley endangered motorists when he pulled out of the drive-thru, cutting off cars at a 'very busy intersection'.

'There were a lot of lives put in danger,' he said.

Coley will appear before a Circuit Court judge in the coming months for another chance at bond and is being held at the York County Detention Center.
