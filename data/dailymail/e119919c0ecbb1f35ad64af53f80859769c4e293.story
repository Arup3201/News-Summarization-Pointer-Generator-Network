Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1992 Committee, called on David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove to support selective education

Senior Tory MPs demanded a return of grammar schools in England yesterday after the Conservatives in Wales announced that they will bring them back if they win the next Assembly election.

Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1992 Committee, called on David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove to support selective education where there are currently no grammar schools.

And he said existing selective schools should be allowed to expand further. There are no remaining grammar schools in Wales and only 164 in England.

David Cameron has angered many of his backbenchers by refusing to overturn a ban introduced by Labour on new grammar schools.

But in a challenge to the leadership, Welsh Tories threw down the gauntlet by proposing plans for children to undergo academic selection at 14 - rather than the old 11 plus - choosing whether to continue with rigorous academic subjects or concentrate on technical or practical courses.

Mr Brady, who resigned from the Tory frontbench in 2007 after Mr Cameron said he would not support more Grammar Schools, said his party should do more for parents in England who don’t want to have to pay for selective schools.

He told the Mail: ‘I’m delighted to see colleagues in Wales thinking so creatively about ways to improve standards of state education.

'In England Michael Gove has done an enormous amount to increase choice and diversity in state schools.

‘I hope we will also be prepared to look at ways of freeing up schools in areas that don’t currently have grammar schools to introduce academic selection.

'Everybody accepts that selection is necessary at 16 before people go on to sit A-Levels. There’s no reason in principle why selection at 14 shouldn’t be tried.

Popular: The proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978

‘In England the government celebrates the success of our existing grammar schools and is happy to allow them to expand or set up annexes in areas which already have grammar schools.

'There is a massive and unfulfilled demand for the rigour of academic selection in other parts of the country where current laws, introduced by Labour, prevent parents having the option of grammar schools in the state sector.’ 

David Davies, the Tory MP for Monmouth, also voiced support for the plans.

He said: ‘Bring back grammar schools! Hope the Tory party in London [is] listening to what we are saying in Wales.’

His colleague Glyn Davies said he ‘loves the UK impact’ of the Welsh announcement.

Angela Burns, the Conservative shadow minister for education in Wales, declared: ‘It is time we put the Grammar back into education and Wales has just that perfect opportunity.

She said: ‘We could see the benefit of creating two equitable streams of education, one alongside the other, a dualing that begins at 14 - giving children the chance to develop important core subject skills before embarking on their chosen path.’ 

The law states that no new selective schools can open with state funding. But the existing grammars have been expanding and taking on new pupils.

The proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 - and almost double the historic low of 1986.

Over the past 25 years, their pupil numbers have soared by tens of thousands. There are now more than 161,000 pupils in state-funded selective schools.

The next Tory signal on selective education will come when Education Secretary Michael Gove rules this autumn on whether to allow one of two grammar schools in Kent to build a new ‘annexe’ in the Kent town of Sevenoaks, miles from the original schools.

A Department for Education spokesman: ‘We have changed the rules so that popular schools, including grammars, can expand in response to parental demand.

'We have received two formal applications from grammar schools in Kent to expand onto the Sevenoaks site. We are currently assessing these applications.’ 

Under devolution, the Welsh Tories are free to set their own policy independent of Mr Cameron’s party in London.

A Conservative Central Office spokesman said: ‘We don’t have an opinion on Welsh education policy because it is a devolved matter.’
