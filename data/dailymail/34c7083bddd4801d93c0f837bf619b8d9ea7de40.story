The Minnesota man whose Twister game launched decades of awkward social interactions at parties has died at the age of 82.

Charles 'Chuck' Foley died on July 1 at a care facility in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park.

His son, Mark Foley, said today that his father suffered from Alzheimer's disease.

Iconic game: Foley and a collaborator were hired in the mid-1960s by a St. Paul firm that was branching into games and toys when they invented Twister (library image)

Foley and a collaborator were hired in the mid-1960s by a St. Paul firm that was branching into games and toys.

They came up with Twister, which was purchased by Milton Bradley and became a sensation after it was featured on 'The Tonight Show' in 1966.

Current manufacturer Hasbro Inc. says Twister continues to be a top seller.

Mark Foley says his father made little money from Twister but continued to be an inventor and held 97 patents.

The party favorite is played with a large plastic mat covered in different colored circles. Each player spins the board which tells them where to put their foot and hand.

Due to the scarcity of colored circles, players will find themselves in precarious positions until eventually someone falls over.

The invention of the game was originally controversial - accused of being 'sex in a box'.

But Twister soon became one of the most popular games in American culture.
