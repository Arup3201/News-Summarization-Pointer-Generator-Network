Jermain Defoe is hoping for a move to the Barclays Premier League to rejoin Harry Redknapp at QPR. 

The striker has been at MLS side Toronto since July, but QPR are in the market for a forward after they lost Loic Remy to Chelsea and Defoe is ready to replace him on a permanent deal. Rangers also hope to tie up a loan deal for Sandro  and are interested in Aaron Lennon, too. 

Both worked under Redknapp at White Hart Lane, but the club wouldn't be able to sign them both temporarily because of loan regulations. 

On his way? Sandro may be set to leave Tottenham and join QPR before the transfer window closes on Monday

Race against time: Sandro may move after seemingly falling out of Mauricio Pochettino's plans at Spurs

Charlie Austin has scored nine goals in his last nine games at Loftus Road.

Redknapp signed Defoe, who has scored 15 goals in 16 league games for Toronto, while in charge at his previous two clubs Tottenham and Portsmouth. Sandro and Lennon were left out of Tottenham’s squad for Sunday’s defeat by Liverpool. 

Toronto FC general manager Tim Bezbatchenko confirmed on Sunday: 'We have received multiple offers for Jermain Defoe and we will make a decision on this in the next 24 hours.' 

Rangers have also bid for Dutch striker Jeremain Lens of Dynamo Kiev and are talking to Dnipro left-back Ivan Strinic. They have also revived interest in Ajax forward Kolbeinn Sigthorsson.

After having to pull Remy out of his squad to face Sunderland at the last minute on Saturday when Chelsea triggered his release clause, Redknapp admitted he would be looking to strengthen in that area. He has only Charlie Austin, who scored his first Premier League goal in their win against Sunderland, and Bobby Zamora as available out-and-out strikers and both have been prone to injuries in recent seasons.

After QPR’s first win of the season, Redknapp called for a rule to be put in place to stop clubs blaming medical tests when deals break down at the last minute. Remy was on the verge of a transfer to Liverpool in July only for the Merseyside club to claim he failed a medical.

Redknapp said: ‘Remy’s a fit lad, he’s never had a problem. That’s a rule that needs to be changed.

‘When there’s a fee agreed and you have the medical, if you don’t sign a player I don’t think you should say he has failed a medical. You should say you couldn’t agree terms. The medical side can finish people’s careers in some cases.’

Redknapp did not have Remy available after Jose Mourinho triggered his £10.5million release clause a few hours before the game.

Remy’s absence did not matter in the end as QPR won their first points of the season when Austin scored from close range in first-half stoppage time.

Redknapp said Liverpool’s allegation damaged QPR. ‘I think it did,’ he added. ‘It didn’t do us any favours.’
