A student who was shot by his cousin and best friend Jaylen Fryberg  in a school cafeteria has taken to Twitter to forgive him from his hospital bed.

Nate Hatch, 14, wrote 'I love you and I forgive you jaylen rest in peace' while in the intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle where he is being treated for a gunshot wound to his jaw.

He was sitting with his friends at Marysville-Pilchuck High School during the lunch break on Friday when the 15-year-old gunman opened fire, killing two girls and injuring three others before turning the gun on himself. 

Forgiveness: Nate Hatch, 14, wrote 'I love you and I forgive you jaylen rest in peace' on Twitter while in Harborview Medical Center in Seattle where he is being treated for a gunshot wound to his jaw

Victim: He was shot in the jaw by his cousin and best friend Jaylen Fryberg during the shooting in Marysville-Pilchuck High School in Washington on Friday

Nate also took to Facebook to update his friends saying he was 'grateful to be alive' after his condition was upgraded from serious to satisfactory. 

Spokeswoman Susan Gregg says he's awake and breathing on his own and still in the intensive care unit.

Nate and Jaylen grew up together in the Native American Tulalip tribe along with Andrew Fryberg, 15, another brother-like cousin who is in a critical condition in Harborview Medical Center following the attack. 

Overnight it was revealed that Gia Soriano had died as a result of her injuries. She was the second person to be confirmed dead as a result of the shooting after Zoe Galasso last week.

Their classmate and friend Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, remains in critical condition in intensive care at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett.

Speaking out: The youngster also took to Facebook to update his friends on his condition. He was upgraded from serious to satisfactory overnight but is still in the intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center 

While he was still in a serious condition, Nate's mother posted on Facebook 

Nate's grandfather, Donald Hatch, revealed Nate started communicating with his family by writing notes as he is unable to speak. 

Mr Hatch told King5 reporter Alex Rozier that Nate knows it was his close cousin Jaylen who opened fire on the group of friends.

He said one of the notes Nate had written to his family reads: 'Grandpa, I still have a bullet in my chest'. 

Mr Hatch added: I think Nate's either getting his memory back or somebody mentioned what had happened.

'And it kind of broke his heart to hear, "why would my brother do that to me," even though they're cousins. 'Why would my brother do that to me?"

Last week Nate's mother, Denise Hatch-Anderson wrote on Facebook, thanking the community for their support in the aftermath of the shooting.

She wrote: 'Thank you so much from the mother of Nate Hatch... i cant [sic] thank everyone from our community for the outpouring love that has been shown [sic] to me since this tragic happened... i love everyone!!! No time for hate just love.'

Since the shooting, it has emerged that Jaylen was left heartbroken over a girl who rebuffed him for the his cousin Andrew.

In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!'

Friends say it was a reference to the fact that he was crushing on the girl dating Andrew, 15, who is still fighting for life. 

Couple: Fryberg's other cousin, Andrew, 15, (left) went to the school's homecoming dance days before the shooting with Zoe Galasso, 14, who was killed in the attack. The gunman reportedly had a crush on her
