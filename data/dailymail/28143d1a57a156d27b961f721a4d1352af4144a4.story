Connected: The couple were arrested in relation to the death of 19-year-old Haley Kemp in June

'These people were probably the biggest heroin traffickers in Midland County at this time. They'll probably be replaced, of course, but that amount of heroin equates to approximately 8,400 dosage units. Some addicts would take four to five a day, but when you get into the thousands you're talking a lot.'

The case was brought to the attention of the DEA after a teenage drug user died earlier this year.

19-year-old Haley Brianne Kemp died from a heroin overdose in June.

The young woman was found dead and it was determined she died as a result of a cocaine and heroin overdose.

At the time of her arrest, Mrs Alvarez was on federal probation for a June 2006 drug trafficking conviction.

She and her son were arrested in connection to an investigation in relation to Kemp's death.

The mother and son  face more than 40 years in federal prison on charges of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance

After tracking down the two men that Ms. Kemp was with when she died and likely sold her the fatal batch, the DEA turned its attention to drug traffickers in the area.

It was at that point the Alverezes became wanted in connection with the death.

The Alvarezes have had a history of drug trafficking in Midland, and multiple family members were implicated in the 2006 case, including Alvarez's husband, son and grandson.
