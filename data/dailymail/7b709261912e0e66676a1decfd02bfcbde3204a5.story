One of the oddest aspects of Cyril Smith’s sinister reign in Rochdale was how well-meaning parents came to connive in the abuse of their own children.

As whispers of his penchant for doling out corporal punishment spread across the town, he would offer his services to give boys ‘a bloody good hiding’ if they stepped out of line.

Parents on Rochdale estates would often use his name to try to frighten badly behaved sons.

‘He was a kind of bogeyman,’ recalls Stephen Moore, a Labour councillor in the Seventies. ‘Parents would say: “If you don’t start behaving, we’ll call for Cyril Smith.”

‘And sometimes they would. Cyril would make his way round, tell the parents he was happy to help, then go upstairs and spank boys till they screamed. He saw it as a kind of public service.’

One such victim was a 16-year-old scooter-riding Mod with a taste for amphetamines and all-night clubbing. He’d spent three months in a detention centre for possession, and relations with his parents were very strained.

‘My dad would scream in my face about how I was causing my mum to worry. The tension was unbearable.

‘Then I came home one night from work and this man was sitting on the settee with my parents on either side of him. He was enormous. Acres of flesh packed into a pinstriped suit.

‘My dad said: “I want you to meet Cyril Smith. He’s the Mayor of Rochdale and is very important. We’ve told him about the problems we’re having and he’s going to have a little chat with you.”

‘My mum and dad left and Smith and I sat staring at each other. “I don’t like your attitude,” he snarled. “Things are going to have to change.”

‘Then he lunged at me, lifted me off my feet, and threw me over his knee. He pulled my trousers and pants down and hammered my flesh with his bare hands like a man possessed.

When he’d finished, he dropped me to the floor and stood above me while I lay with my face down trying to forget about the pain. I never made a noise. I wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing he’d hurt me.

‘My skin was on fire and I could feel the welts forming, but I pulled my trousers up, sat up and stared insolently back at him. “Is that it?” I said.

‘He was still panting but a nasty little smile formed on his face as he knelt next to me and pushed his face close to mine. “Your bad behaviour is going to stop,’ he hissed, “or I’ll kill you.” I thought he was a psycho.’

The teenager hoped he’d seen the last of Smith. He was wrong.

When he went back to his job at a local factory, his boss sidled up to his workbench and asked what he was doing at the weekend, adding: ‘I was thinking that maybe we could go camping together in the Lake District.’

When the lad said he’d rather not as camping wasn’t his thing, he suggested they get a caravan instead. The boy said no again.

Later that day, his boss called him in and fired him. It was clear this was to be his punishment for having turned down his advances. And worse was to come.

‘You won’t be out of a job,’ he smiled. ‘I’ve seen to that. There’s a friend of mine who runs a spring manufacturing company across town and takes on lads with criminal records. He helps them back on the straight and narrow.

‘I’ve called him and he said he can give you a job at his factory. His name’s Cyril Smith.’

On the boy’s first day there, Smith put his arm around him and said: ‘I’m going to look after you now.’ The boy shuddered.

‘And so began the strangest time I’ve ever known. All week I worked for Cyril, and at weekends he’d be round our house beating the living daylights out of me.

‘I sometimes wondered if it was all a bad dream. I worked for an enormous fat man who’d wink at me all day and tell me he was going to be my dad — then, when the weekend came round, he’d be knocking on our door itching to get my trousers off and start spanking my backside.

‘Cyril tried everything to intimidate me. He told me all the important people he knew. He boasted of his relationship with the chief constable. I wasn’t impressed.

‘I asked him once why he had such a fixation with smacking my backside. Did my parents know he was doing this? He backhanded me and told me I had an attitude problem.

‘After a few months, I think Cyril realised he wasn’t going to win this battle. He wasn’t going to batter me into submission.

He got his business partner, Geoff, to sack me. He didn’t have the guts to do it himself. He told my parents I was a lost cause and that there was no hope for me. It was the best day of my life. I got another job soon after and things started to look up.  

‘I never told my parents what Cyril had done to me, though I suspect they’d known what was really going on. I was more than relieved to have escaped Cyril’s clutches — but I soon came into contact with boys who hadn’t.

‘Because I’d spent three months in a detention centre, I still had to report to a probation officer, so every few weeks I’d make my way over to their office on Drake Street in Rochdale.

‘That’s where I met other boys who told me that Cyril Smith had seriously sexually abused them. We’d all sit in the corridor waiting to be seen, and the conversation would quickly turn to Cyril.

‘As I listened to their stories, I started to realise I’d got off lightly. These were damaged kids. They had no confidence and came from broken homes. Some had been in care.

‘Most had been in the Cambridge House boys’ hostel that Cyril had opened. That’s where he’d abused them. Their stories sent shivers down my spine.

‘I asked one lad why he’d put up with it. He had nowhere else to go, he said. He couldn’t bear to sleep on the streets.

‘There were other boys I’d bump into in town who told me Cyril had abused them, too. I remember one lad who worked in the cinema as an usher. He had a hollow look in his eyes, as though his future had been ripped out of him. All he had left was a deep sense of loss.

‘I still wonder what happened to those lads.

‘Once I no longer had to meet the probation officer, that world began to recede and I moved on to different things. I worked hard, got married, and ended up going to work in Australia.

‘I returned to Rochdale many years later and no longer thought about Cyril. Then, one day in 1990, the police knocked on my door. They were investigating claims that Cyril Smith had abused young boys.

‘I had no idea how they’d got hold of me. Perhaps some of the lads who I met at the probation office had mentioned my name.

‘I told them what had happened in the 1960s and made a statement. Cyril was still the town’s MP, and I hoped it wasn’t too late for his past to catch up with him.

‘I never heard anything more from the police, and it wasn’t until his crimes were publicly exposed after his death in 2012 that I realised there had been a number of investigations into Cyril that had gone nowhere.

‘I thought back to what he’d said to me at the time. The threat that he would kill me; the talk of how close he was to the chief constable.

I’d laughed it off. But how would other less assured boys have reacted? They’d have been terrified. And that was his aim. Finding vulnerable young boys, striking fear into them and breaking them.

‘I tried to talk to Mum about it, before she got Alzheimer’s. She just shook her head and I could see the tears forming in her eyes. I put my arm round her and didn’t say any more.

‘She knew calling him in was a mistake, but I guess they were at their wits’ end. I didn’t blame them. How could they have known what a real monster he was?

‘But plenty of people did know what a real monster Cyril was. He wasn’t acting on his own. We used to laugh when we saw groups of men getting off the train and coming into Rochdale because we all knew what they were up to. The dirty mac brigade, we called them.

‘Cyril couldn’t have abused all these boys on his own. He had a team of people behind him. They were all in on it.

‘It took the police long enough to knock on my door. I hope there’s still time for Cyril’s cronies to get a knock on their door.’
