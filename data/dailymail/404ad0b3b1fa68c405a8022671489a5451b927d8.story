Century-old mix-up: Evelyn Frost found out shortly before she turned 100 that she'd been celebrating her birthday on the wrong day for 99 years

A woman discovered that she had been celebrating her birthday on the wrong day for her entire life – just before she turned 100.

The blunder was only discovered after Evelyn Frost from Tamworth, Staffordshire, applied for her birth certificate to register for her letter from the Queen.

Instead of listing her date of birth as April 17, 1914, the certificate revealed it was April 16.

Her son Dennis said: ‘We were looking at sending off for the Queen’s letter and we had to send off her birth certificate.

'She has never had one before and when it eventually came through she couldn’t believe it.’

This week Mrs Frost marked her birthday on the correct day as she celebrated the milestone with her family and friends.

Her daughter-in-law Freida said: ‘We celebrated on Wednesday for the first time and even Evelyn said it felt a bit weird.

‘She is still very surprised and she wants to celebrate her birthday on the 17th as well.’

Baby of the family Evelyn Starkey was born in Tamworth, the youngest of 10 siblings and is mother to Dennis, 72, Margaret, 75, and Hazel, 71.
