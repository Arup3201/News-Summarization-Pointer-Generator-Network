Student volunteers carried out a quick cleanup of Keene State College campus after classmates set fires in the streets and overturned at least one car during a riot at a pumpkin carving festival.

At least one car was flipped over by crowds of people, and the photos showed streets littered with beer cans, but students said there were enough volunteers to finish cleaning in under a half hour.

'We all recognize that we made a mistake and we're going to better next year,' said Mallory Pierce, Keene State sophomore and student body vice president. 'We're not going to let this happen again.'

Cleanup: Student groups and athletic teams called for volunteers, who showed up to offer help in a campus-wide cleaning after riots marred Keene Pumpkin Fest

Groups flooded the streets coming from parties being held along with the  Keene Pumpkin Festival, an event where attendees try to carve and light a record-number of pumpkins each year. 

Keene police reports state that one group made threats to assault an elderly man and said an attendee overheard others talking about killing police.

At least 30 were reportedly injured during the riots, with 20 needing to be transported to the hospital, according to Keene Fire Chief Mark Howard who spoke with New England Cable News.

News cameras and attendees on social media caught rioters flipping a car, tearing street signs from the ground and setting fires in the streets.

At least 49 people were arrested over the weekend, though not all were related to the out-of-control partying. Most of those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct or alcohol-related offences.

College President Anne Huot released a statement saying that the school would look at social media and photos of the riots to identify any students involved.

Hauling: Student volunteers were able to finish the majority of their cleaning operations in under a half hour on Sunday

Trashed: Keene State students volunteered to clean up the massive amounts of garbage and destruction left behind by rioters

Mob: Groups of partiers overturned a car and reportedly jumped from roofs during wild rioting coinciding with Keene's Pumpkin Festival

Bloodied: Several students, including this unnamed boy, had been injured by beer bottles thrown at one party off campus

Wild: Huge crowds including Keene State College students and visitors to an annual pumpkin festival in New Hampshire became unruly Saturday, leading to injuries and arrests

Injuries: The Southwestern New Hampshire Fire Mutual Aid organization said on Twitter that several people were injured from thrown bottles at a party involving hundreds of people

Geared up: Police arrived on scene in riot gear, using tear gas and pepper spray to disperse rioters in the streets, leading to at least 49 people being arrested

'The most serious offenders will face interim suspension, followed by conduct action up to, and including, expulsion,' the statement read.

Huot also said in recent years some have encouraged visitors to come to the pumpkin festival as 'a destination for destructive and raucous behavior.'

Keene State student Ellery Murray told The Boston Globe she was at a party that had drawn a large crowd when people started throwing things. 

Situation: New Hampshire Gov Maggie Hassan said state and local safety officials worked to defuse what she called 'the situation'

Fall fun: The pumpkin festival happens every year, with revelers coming to try and set the record for most pumpkins carved in a single location

Festival: The pumpkins go on display for visitors and Keene State President Anne Huot has said that the festival has lately attracted people looking to engage in 'destructive and raucous behavior'

'People were just throwing everything they could find — rocks, skateboards, buckets, pumpkins,' she said. 'People just got too drunk.'  

'It got way out of hand. Everyone I talked to said, "I feel unsafe, I'm going home." They didn't want to be part of the riot, and they couldn't do anything to solve it,' said Pierce. 'I honestly did not feel safe.'

Brian Mazzola told the Associated Press that many in his building had not gone outside Saturday night after hearing about the escalating mayhem.

He claimed some of the violence resulted from police breaking up house parties earlier in the night, leaving 'a mob of drunk kids on the street,' though he felt the later response was justified.

'It was kind of scary,' he said. 'We could hear the helicopters circling around telling people to go inside.'

With media coverage of protests over the shooting death of Michael Brown often focusing on looting, people took to Twitter to critique how the media depicted well-off college students rioting.

Users also jumped on the #pumpkinfest and #pumpkinspiceriots hashtags to poke fun at the rioters.

'How you get arrested in head to toe LL Bean though?!'  tweeted Charles Wade.

'I heard the chili used in the pepper spray isn't even organic or fair-trade,' another user krsna joked.
