During
 her time in the Celebrity Big Brother house, Casey Batchelor was embroiled in a 
love triangle with Lee Ryan and US actress Jasmine Waltz.

Since leaving the show, Lee and Jasmine's relationship has gone from 
strength to strength, with the pair recently holidaying together in 
Thailand - and putting on some very public displays of affection.

With Jasmine parading her perfectly toned physique on the sun-drenched beaches, it comes as no surprise that Casey may have been feeling a little insecure - and now we can reveal that she paid out nearly £700 for a fat-freezing treatment to help her match her love rival in the bikini body stakes.

Slimming secret: Celebrity Big Brother star Casey Batchelor showed off her figure in a tiny pink bikini in Marrakesh earlier this week, and now we can reveal the secret behind her trimmed new physique

The 29-year-old model, who was feeling self-conscious about her stomach after putting on nearly a stone in weight during her time in the CBB house, wanted to shed a few inches before her recent trip to Morocco.

She had a £670 hour long treatment at the LoveLite clinic in Harley Street, tweeting a picture of herself on the day of her treatment with the caption: '@LoveLiteUk having a lovely time having lipoglaze. Summer here I come :)'.

Quick fix? The £670 treatment claims to freeze fat cells, which pass naturally from the body

Fans of the Lipoglaze treatment, which claims to freeze fat cells that then waste away naturally,  include The Only Way Is Essex stars Ricky Rayment and Bobby Norris, as well as Made In Chelsea stars Binky Felstead, Louise Thompson and Ashley James.

Since leaving the CBB 
house, 5ft 4in Casey certainly hasn't been short of male attention and 
was seen kissing singer Miles Kane in a nightclub last month.

The bubbly brunette has also voiced her plans to design her own range of bikinis for girls with bigger cleavages. Watch this space.
