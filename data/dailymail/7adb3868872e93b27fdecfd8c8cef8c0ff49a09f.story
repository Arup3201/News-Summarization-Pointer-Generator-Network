The secret to happiness in modern Britain is earning £80,840 a year and living in a £443,000 house. 

At least that's according to a new study which has found that the ideal life would involve working a 27-hour week and having two children.

The ideal four-bedroom family home should be no more than 45 miles from the rest of people's direct family, although some Britons insist they want to live less than a mile from their loved ones.

Men and women have slightly different ideas on their ideal partner, according to the research by 3M Post-it.

While the average man wants a wife who is three-and-a-half years younger than him, the ideal partner for women is just over a year older.

Men also seem to be more materialistic in their goals, saying they would need a salary of £96,010 to make them truly happy, while women insist £68,770 would suffice.

A third of people say their main goal in life is earning more money, with 15 per cent of those surveyed saying they would not be satisfied until they earn more than £100,000 a year.

However, a fifth of people insist their happiness is not dependent on salary, while 60 per cent say money cannot buy happiness. 

Two in five lucky people believe they have already achieved true happiness while 23 per cent fear they will never be truly happy, the research found.

After being wealthy, high up on most people's life goals is starting a family and travelling the world (pictured posed by models)

Sadly, 16 per cent of us believe we will never get close to achieving our dreams.

Men want to live in a more upmarket home than women, aiming for one worth £498,000 compared to £402,000 for their female counterparts.

Money is seen as the biggest barrier to achieving life goals (46 per cent) followed by age (34 per cent) and a lack of determination or bravery, cited by one in four.

The research suggests the other things we strive for to achieve our ideal life are to travel the world (33 per cent), live a healthy lifestyle (33 per cent), lose weight (28 per cent) and fall in love with ‘the one’ (28 per cent). 

The study shows that 62 per cent of people believe the health, wealth and happiness of loved ones contributes more to an ideal life than our own health, wealth and happiness. 

One in five women would be happiest with their family living within one mile, compared to just over one in ten men. 

Meanwhile 16 per cent of women believe family commitments get in the way of achieving their life goals, compared to just 8 per cent of men.
