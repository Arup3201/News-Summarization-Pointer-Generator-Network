MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may be barred from voting on laws which only affect England, as the Government moves to tackle the thorny 'West Lothian question' for the first time.

An independent commission will be set up to consider the issue, which was first raised 34 years ago by Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for West Lothian.

The question has become more pertinent since the advent of devolution in 1997, when separate administrations were set up for Scotland and Wales.

Parliament: MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could be barred from voting on England-only legislation

Since then a large number of policy issues, particularly relating to public services, have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly.

English MPs sitting at Westminster have no say over the policies set outside of English borders.

However, English policies on issues like education and healthcare are still decided by the UK Parliament, and are voted on by MPs who make up the chamber meaning they can come from all the countries of the Union.

In 1977, Tam Dalyell, pictured above, the Labour MP for West Lothian, pointed out that Scottish devolution could mean Scottish MPs voting on English affairs, with English MPs unable to vote on Scottish affairs.

In response, controversial right-wing MP Enoch Powell said: 'Let us call it the West Lothian question.'

The introduction of Scots and Welsh devolution in 1997 meant that responsibility for many policy areas was taken out of the hands of Westminster, but that MPs from those countries could still vote on purely English issues.

Solutions which have been suggested for the problem include the establishment of a purely English parliament, and banning Scottish MPs from votes which do not affect their constituents.

However, every possible answer has its drawbacks, and none has been very widely accepted despite it being an issue which has rumbled on for 34 years.

Since devolution, there have been growing calls for 'English votes for English laws', so that MPs should no longer be able to vote on laws which will not apply in their consistuencies.

The controversial voting issue became particularly heated in 2004, when Labour's policy on top-up fees was passed only with the support of Scottish MPs, even though the controversial policy did not apply in Scotland.

Now after 34 years the current Government is determined to take action to end the anomaly.

Constitutional reform minister Mark Harper announced in a statement to MPs that a formal proposal for the commission's work, and its terms of references, will be announced soon after Parliament returns from the party conference season.

It will be made up of a small group of non-partisan experts with constitutional, legal and parliamentary expertise.

Their primary task will be to examine how the Westminster Parliament can 'deal most effectively with business that affects England wholly or primarily, when at the same time similar matters in some or all of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are lawfully and democratically the responsibility of the separate parliament or assemblies,' Mr Harper said.

Ministers will consult with Commons Speaker John Bercow and other parliamentary authorities before the launch of the commission, he added.

All political parties will be given 'a full opportunity to have their say' following the completion of the commission's work.

The commission will not consider the funding of different parts of the UK, nor the balance between English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs in the House of Commons.

Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd said: 'England deserves to have its own administration to deal with issues which affect England only.

'This would then ensure that there is a clear distinction between what is a matter for England and what is a matter for other countries too. The lines are too blurred as they are.'
