A super-slick, catamaran-like craft is being touted as the 21st century answer to the speedboat.

The Quadrofoil uses C-shaped hydrofoils to lift the craft out of the water, allowing it to reach a top speed of 25mph (40kph).

The shape of the four foils creates lift, to haul the vessel above the surface of the water and travel with minimal water resistance and in turn very little noise.

A speedboat will allow holiday makers to 'fly' above water, instead of gliding through it. The Quadrofoil (pictured) uses  hydrofoils to lift the craft out of the water and allow it to reach a top speed of 25mph (40kph)

Marine engineers from Slovenia, who invented the craft, described it as ‘a thrilling yet quiet and eco-friendly watercraft’. 

‘Its silent motor and zero emissions enable it to ride on lakes, rivers, seas & eco-zones where most motor boats and PWC’s are not allowed. No noise, no waves, no emissions.’

The Quadrofoil has four hydrofoils, which are wing-like lifting surfaces that operate in water.

They look like airfoils used by aeroplanes and are mounted on struts below the hull

When speed is gained, they lift the boat's hull out of the water, decreasing drag and allowing greater speeds.

The foils are shaped to move smoothly through the water causing water flow to be deflected downward, which exerts an upward force on the foil.

This turning of the water causes higher pressure on the bottom and reduced pressure on the top of the foil.

This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, so the resulting flow about the foil has a higher average velocity on one side than the other.

When used as a lifting element on a hydrofoil boat, this upward force lifts the body of the vessel, decreasing drag and increasing speed.

Height: 3ft 11 inches (1.2 metres)

Length: 9ft 10 inches (3 metres)

Width with foils: 8ft 2 inches (2.5 metres)

Weight: 220lbs (100kg)

Seats: 2

Speed: 25mph (40kph)

Range: 62 miles (100km) on a full battery 

Batteries: 10KWh

Cost: €22,500 (£17,586 or $28,144)

Shipping date: March 2015

The craft costs €22,500 (£17,586 or $28,144) and will be shipped in March next year.

It is powered by an electric motor and will cost less than 80p ($1.3) an hour to run.

The Quadrofoil is easy to operate, according to its creators and the steering wheel has an integrated touch screen display to show a user how much battery power the boat has left, as well as its range and speed.

The battery will give the craft a range of 62miles (100km) on a single charge.

The wheel will act as a detachable key, so that no-one else can start the engine when it is removed.

The boat has an integrated steering system, which is designed to keep the craft stable, prevents drifting and makes the craft responsive.

It is made to be stable and stay horizontal at all times because of the foil design, which places the centre of gravity 26 ft (eight metres) above the vessel.

The lightweight hull is built from composite materials and weighs just 220 lbs (100kg).

Despite claiming the Quadrofoil is unsinkable and super stable, the craft will come with two life jackets, a paddle and safety whistle.
