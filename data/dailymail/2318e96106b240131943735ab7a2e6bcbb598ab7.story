The husband of the female staffer caught kissing a conservative, Christian lawmaker on video has said that the revelation has destroyed his life and his marriage is over.

Heath Peacock, 34, has been left 'devastated' after his wife Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, 33, was caught passionately kissing Louisiana Rep. Vance McAllister - who also happens to be Mr Peacock's childhood friend.

Mr Peacock told The Ouachita Citizen today: 'I’m just freaking devastated by the whole deal, man. I loved my wife so much. I cannot believe this. I cannot freaking believe it. I feel like I’m going to wake up here in a minute and this is all going to be a bad nightmare.'

He added: 'He has wrecked my life. We are headed for divorce.'

The 34-year-old was informed of his wife's infidelity only a few hours before the scandal went public on Monday. The couple have been married for six years and have a six-year-old son.

Mr Peacock, who donated $10,000 to McAllister's campaign fund, says his wife no longer works for the politician. He added that he has yet to receive a personal apology from McAllister.

The McAllisters and Peacocks have been friends for many years. Facebook pictures posted online to Kelly McAllister's profile show both couples together at a birthday party in 2009.

The two men grew up three miles apart and they both graduated in 1990 from the same high school. McAllister
 also worked with Mr Peacock over a 16-year period for Mustang 
Engineering, a Houston, Texas-based oil and gas company.

McAllister,
 a married, conservative Christian politician with five children, offered a contrite apology on Monday after he was
 caught on video kissing Mrs Peacock at his office.

Surveillance tape 
from December 23 recorded inside the Republican's office in Monroe, shows 
him engaged in a stolen clinch with Peacock, who was his district 
scheduler - and the wife of a childhood friend.

In a statement issued on Monday, McAllister said: 'There's no doubt I've fallen short and 
I'm asking for forgiveness. I'm asking for forgiveness from God, my 
wife, my kids, my staff, and my constituents who elected me to serve.

Named: This is Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, 33, - who has been named as the woman caught in a clinch with married GOP Representative Vance McAllister, of Louisiana

'Trust is something I know has to be 
earned whether your a husband, a father, or a congressman. I promise to 
do everything I can to earn back the trust of everyone I've 
disappointed.'

McAllister is seen on the tape wearing a crumpled, purple shirt. He turns off the lights in the room before a woman with long, dark hair and is wearing a beige trench coat, short skirt and knee-high boots, comes to stand beside him.

The couple peck each other on the lips then have a long, lingering kiss. The man then sets what appears to be an alarm panel on the wall and both leave the building.

They are both caught on an outside security camera exiting the building, the woman first and then McAllister. When they get to the driveway of the building, they separate.

McAllister, a veteran and businessman, 
entered the House of Representatives in November after campaigning on a 
ticket of Christian, family values.

He has been married to wife Kelly Duncan McAllister for 17 years. The couple have five children and live in rural Swartz, east of Monroe in Louisiana.

Their oldest daughter Anna Claire Rogers, 19, was adopted by the McAllisters in 2010 and now attends the University of Louisiana at Monroe.

They have four other children Emilie Katherine, 12, Duncan Michael, nine, Vance, five, and three-year-old Eva Grace.

McAllister, played up his membership of the North Monroe Baptist Church during his congressional campaign.

McAllister’s campaign benefited from support from the Robertson family 
of Duck Dynasty fame. Phil Robertson publicly supported McAllister 
while Willie Robertson endorsed McAllister in a YouTube video.

He describes his decision to run for Congress as a 'prayerful one. Many people make light of my spiritual faith, but that is okay with me. I know the blessing that I have received from the good Lord and the inner peace that comes from being a believer'.

He went on: 'I knew there were a number of qualified people in the district to be congressman, but also I realized that I had the time and the financial capability ... that maybe [the others] didn't.'

Calls to McAllister's office seeking further comment went unanswered on Monday.
