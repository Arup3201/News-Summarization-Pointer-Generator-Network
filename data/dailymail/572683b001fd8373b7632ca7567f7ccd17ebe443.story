Alan Pardew gave his Newcastle players a day to rid themselves of their derby despair and has banned talk of their fourth straight Tyne-Wear loss.

The Magpies were told to stay away from the training ground on Monday as they recovered from the 1-0 reverse 24 hours earlier, inflicted when Adam Johnson struck in the last minute.

Pardew’s side now travel to Manchester United on Boxing Day as they look to halt a run of three losses.

And the manager said: ‘We have to move on, it's as simple as that. We can't dwell on it. It was a performance that was pretty good, but it wasn't enough.

‘I have just kept them away from the training ground. They have come in today (Tuesday) and we will have a warm-down, so I haven't really seen them, to be honest.’

Newcastle are still in the top half of the Premier League table having won five games on the spin over October and November.

And Pardew added: ‘We have good spirit and character in the squad. In terms of how we lost the game, if we were going to lose a game, I’d rather we lost it like that.

‘We tried to win it, and that ambition won’t leave this team because we have a good spirit and we never give in. That’s been in evidence since Southampton (4-0 defeat) really.’
