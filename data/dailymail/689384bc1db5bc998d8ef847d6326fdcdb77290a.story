If you’ve already invested in a brand new autumn wardrobe and can’t wait to wear it all, you’re in luck this weekend.

Everyone else? Well, you’d better go find your old cagoule fairly sharpish.

Storms are set to batter huge swathes of the country tomorrow, with forecasters issuing severe weather warnings for many areas.

Autumn storms: Last week waves pounded the wall surrounding Seaham lighthouse in County Durham

Vile conditions: Driving rain and strong winds ghave replaced the sunny summer weather of late

Winds of up to 70mph are expected in 
parts of Scotland, North-West England, North Wales and Northern Ireland 
tomorrow, with blustery conditions in the South.

The wind will be accompanied by up to two and a half inches of rain.

Last week, Britain left summer behind in typical fashion with wind, rain and plummeting temperatures.

And just as the dire autumn conditions begin, forecasters have warned the weather will get dramatically worse over the weekend.

Forecasters also predict that up to two-and-a-half inches of rain could fall over the weekend.

The South will avoid the high-speed winds, but will not escape low temperatures, showers and the first signs of a cold autumn.

Temperatures will be in the mid-teens in some parts, but will drop to as low as 10C during the day in the north of Scotland.

It comes a week after hailstorms and torrential rain hit parts of North Yorkshire and the North East, leading to dozens of people being evacuated from their homes.

Lindsay Mears, a spokesman for the Met Office said it was going to uncharacteristically cold for this time of year and admitted the weather would not be pleasant for the next few days.

She said: 'We are going to get some rather wild weather coming in.

'Tomorrow will not be too bad with a few scattered showers, reasonably normal temperature for this time of year.

'But we are looking at a yellow warning being in place on Sunday and Monday in Scotland and the North East of England.

'We are expecting gales of between 45 to 60mph with cold temperatures. It is possible it could go up to 70 on coastal areas. It will be really unpleasant.

Change: Last week, 11 miles down the coast from Seaham, the sun beamed down on South Marsden beach in South Shields

This time last year parts of the country saw similar Autumn gales, with the seafront at Swansea Marina (pictured) feeling the impact

'The south will escape the wild weather with pleasant conditions but colder temperatures than is typical for this time of year.

'This yellow warning means drivers need to be aware of things that may have blown onto the road when they are out and about.

'There are no warnings for Tuesday, but it will feel quite cold compared with the last few weeks.

'From then, it is going to feel a lot colder than it has done.'

Last week saw extraordinary extremes as the country was hit by a mixture of blizzards and hailstorms, but it seems the cold weather and the decline into winter will begin on Tuesday.

The Met Office said it is likely that 2013 will be one of the ten warmest summers 
since records began in 1910.

Heat maps revealed the mercury has been 2C higher than average this summer.

August 1, has so far been the hottest day of the year with temperatures reaching 33.7C at Heathrow Airport in West London, surpassing the previous seven-year high of 33.5C on July 22.

Estimates also suggest that just 7.45in of rain fell between June and 
August, about 78 per cent of the UK average.

This made it the driest summer since 2006 and has led to an early Autumn with trees expected to shed their leaves in the next couple of weeks.

Last week dozens of people had to be evacuated from their homes after almost a month and a half's worth of rain fall in just 24 hours.

In some areas of North Yorkshire as much as 75mm of rain fall over a 24 hour period, almost one and a half times the average September monthly rainfall.

Durham was Britain's wettest city with over 58mm of rain.

In Redcar, Cleveland, up to 60 people had to be evacuated while in nearby Saltburn part of a bridge was washed away with some areas seeing up to three inches of rain fall. 

And on the other side of the country a freak hail storm covered parts of Devon and Cornwall in a blanket of white creating a winter wonderland, at the beginning of September.

Just a few days before, forecasters were predicting an Indian Summer with the mercury reaching 28C on September 1st.

But the hopes were washed away a week later with a flurry of showers and plummeting temperatures.
