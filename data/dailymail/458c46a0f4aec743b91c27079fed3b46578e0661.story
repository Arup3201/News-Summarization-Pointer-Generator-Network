Tough? Labour's Rachel Reeves signalled a toughening of opposition stance

Britain's three main parties were on a collision course with Brussels last night after they all backed plans to limit migrants’ benefits – in defiance of the European Commission.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said migrants should not be able to obtain welfare payments until they had been in the UK for two years – eight times the current limit of three months.

And Labour’s Rachel Reeves signalled a toughening of the opposition’s stance, calling for them to receive handouts only if they had paid into the system first as taxpayers. Even Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was ‘eminently sensible’ to work with other EU nations to tighten the rules.

But the growing consensus that the free movement of labour had gone too far was rejected by EU Employment Commissioner Laszlo Andor.He called the proposed two-year limit ‘a problem’ that would violate EU rules.

The Government has enshrined the current three-month limit in law after advice from its lawyers.

But Mr Duncan Smith revealed that he is already talking to Britain’s allies, including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, about plans to dramatically extend it.

He told the Sunday Times: ‘It could be a year, it could be two years. After that, then we will consider you a resident of the UK and be happy to pay you benefits.’

He said migrants should ‘demonstrate that you are committed to the country, that you are a resident and that you are here for a period of time and you are generally taking work and that you are contributing’.

Far from criticising the Government, Miss Reeves made clear that Labour now supports the ‘contributory principle’ on benefits – a posture that won her predecessor as Mr Duncan Smith’s shadow, Liam Byrne, criticism from some on the Labour left.

Mr Clegg said it was 'eminently sensible' for the Government to  'come to an agreement that says you have to jump through certain hoops before you can claim benefits'

She said: ‘It has got to be right that you only get something out of our social security system if you put something in.’

Mr Clegg told Pienaar’s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live it was ‘eminently sensible’ for the Government to  ‘come to an agreement that says you have to jump through certain hoops before you can claim benefits’.

But Mr Andor attacked politicians of all parties, branding them ‘nasty’ for the second time in a month and warning that Britain risks ‘losing friends’ if they continue with the same rhetoric.

‘We shouldn’t assume the UK welfare system is a lot more generous than that of many other countries,’ he said.

A source close to Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘It’s not the UK that is isolated, it is the European Commission that is isolated, sticking to rules that no longer command public support.'
