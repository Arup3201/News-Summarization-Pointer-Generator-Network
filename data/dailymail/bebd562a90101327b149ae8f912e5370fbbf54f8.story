A welcome full of pomp and military splendour was staged for the President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) today as he was formally greeted by the Queen.

Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is on a two-day state visit to the UK, was treated to the spectacle of some of Britain’s most prestigious regiments on full display at Windsor Castle.

In glorious spring sunshine, the UAE’s head of state enjoyed a carriage procession with the Queen through Windsor to the Berkshire town’s famous castle.

Crowds lined the streets of Windsor 
as the Household Cavalry, in their breastplates and plumed helmets, 
provided a Sovereign’s Escort for the procession of carriages carrying 
the Queen and her guests.

Hundreds of soldiers on foot from the Grenadier Guards and Scots Guards were also stationed at intervals through the town.

The
Queen and the UAE leader travelled together in the Scottish State 
Coach, while Philip made the journey in the Australian State Coach with 
the UAE’s deputy prime minister, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, 
owner of Premier League football club Manchester City.

In the castle’s quadrangle, the immaculate Welsh Guards formed two rows, waiting to be inspected by the president.

The Arab leader took his place on a 
small dais with the Queen on his right and the Duke on his left as the 
national anthems were played.

Philip then led the way for the 
inspection, gesturing to the president, and the UAE ruler, wearing 
traditional flowing robes, strode past the guardsmen who, when not on 
ceremonial duty, are fighting soldiers.

The
final element of the welcome was a parade past the royal party by all 
the military units involved in today’s events with horses and men 
thundering past the trio.

The Queen then led her guests into the castle, where she was hosting a state lunch for the president, his entourage of ministers and officials, and other guests who included senior members of her household and Prime Minister David Cameron.

They dined on a starter of asparagus mousse with parmesan shortbread, quails' eggs and asparagus salad, followed by a main of noisettes of Windsor estate lamb, Jersey royal potatoes and a selection of vegetables, and to finish there was a dessert of rhubarb creme brulee tartlet.

In the castle's Waterloo Chamber, the Queen told the president: 'Our two countries have been close friends since before the foundation of the United Arab Emirates in 1971, under the wise guidance and leadership of your late father, Sheikh Zayed.

'Your visit this week is a chance to 
celebrate the depth of our partnership - a partnership that continues to
grow and strengthen.

'Our
Treaty of Friendship signed in 1971 declared that the UAE and the UK 
would consult each other, promote educational, scientific and cultural 
co-operation and build close trade relations.

'This has never been truer than it is today and I am delighted with how our ties have developed, spearheaded by the UK-UAE Taskforce.'

She added: 'The UAE is one of our largest trading partners in the Gulf region, and we have welcomed Emirati investments in the United Kingdom in many areas from the construction of the largest port facilities in the UK to the Emirates Skyline, the spectacular cable-car crossing over the Thames and, of course, Manchester City.'

In response to the Queen's address, the foreign leader gave a short speech which also highlighted the links between his homeland and Britain.

He said: 'We shall strive to develop further the long-established bilateral relations that exist between the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom in all fields, in order to achieve the interests of our two friendly countries.

'Indeed, it is my hope that this current visit serves to reinforce our deep rooted and steadfast friendship that has continued for many, many years.'

The traditional exchange of gifts took 
place after lunch when the Queen gave the president something associated
with his passion for falconry, the UAE's national sport.

She presented 
him with a falcon head statuette and wooden display box while in return 
the president gave the Queen a five-strand pearl necklace made from 
natural pearls from the Arabian Gulf and a family photograph in a gold 
jewelled frame.

The sheikh's trip comes as three 
British men were jailed in Dubai for four years each for possessing 
drugs, amid claims that they were tortured.

During
talks with the UAE head at Downing Street tomorrow, Mr 
Cameron is expected to address the claims of the men - Grant Cameron and
Suneet Jeerh, both 25, and Karl Williams, 26.

A
Foreign Office spokesman said the state visit 'will primarily be a 
chance to develop and strengthen relations between the UK and UAE' but 
the trio’s case would be brought up.

'Ministers will raise these cases along with other issues during the course of the state visit.'
