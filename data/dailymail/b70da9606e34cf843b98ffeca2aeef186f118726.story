When Bert Hendy dialled 999 for help for his dying wife he didn’t expect a visit from the bomb squad.

But the first paramedic to reach his home called in explosives experts after spotting a wartime shell on the pensioner’s mantelpiece.

Jean, Mr Hendy’s wife of 63 years, had died before the ambulance arrived but her body was not moved for another four hours while the bizarre incident unfolded.

Bomb squad: Bert Hendy, of Whitchurch, Bristol, had been given the nose cone of the deactivated shell (right) 10 years ago. He had dialled 999 after his 81-year-old wife Jean (left) stopped breathing shortly after waking up

Accompanied by police, the explosives 
experts examined and photographed the device before eventually taking it
away to a police station.

The couple’s son Steve, 62, said: 
‘This was typical of mum – causing such a drama. In a way it was a 
fitting finale – she certainly went out with a bang.’

He said his mother, 81, slipped into unconsciousness shortly after waking up last Sunday.

‘By the time paramedics arrived, mum 
had sadly passed away,’ he added. ‘But while he was here, the paramedic 
noticed the nose cone of this bomb on the mantelpiece.

'He kept picking 
it up and looking at it and then said to us that he thought
it was live and he was going to have to call the police.

'We couldn’t 
believe it. Mum had just passed away and all this was going on around 
her.’

House: The body of Mrs Hendy was left on the sofa for three-and-a-half hours at her home in Bristol (pictured) while officers dealt with the 3in tall nose cone, which was nailed to a wooden plinth

Mr Hendy, 85 and a former Navy officer, was given the First World War British shell ten years ago in Hotton, Belgium.

He was visiting a graveyard in the town where his brother, Fred, 19, was buried after being killed in the Second World War.

Steve said: ‘He drilled the shell and ground it so it would fit on this plinth.

‘At no time did any of us think it 
could be live – it is 100 years old. It’s one of his pride and joys and 
had just been sitting there for years.’

Police have now returned the nose cone to Mr Hendy’s Bristol home and issued him with a certificate saying it is safe.

Ambulance sent: The paramedic called Avon and Somerset Constabulary officers, who arrived at the home with bomb experts to take photographs and remove the shell (file picture)

A police spokesman said: ‘At around 
8.15am on Sunday, July 28, we were informed by the ambulance service 
that they had found some sort of World War One device. We attended the 
property in Allerton Crescent and took photos of the object.

‘At 12.30pm the Explosives Ordnance 
Disposal advised us that they were happy with the object and it could 
safely be removed to the local police station.’

The paramedic had served in the Royal Marines.
