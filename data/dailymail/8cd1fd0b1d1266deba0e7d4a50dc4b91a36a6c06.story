Anonymous pranksters have created a spoof map detailing the 'contemporary art' highlights of Huddersfield.

The group - who call themselves MapFodder - poke fun of the pretentious blurb alongside modern art in galleries while leading walkers on a trial of eyesores through the West Yorkshire town.

The leaflet, entitled Huddersfield Contemporary Art Trail (HCAT) have been anonymously distributed around public places with a railway station, car park and bus station among the highlights.

Fluorescent strip lights on a tower are grandly renamed 'Never! Never! Never! Never! by Christian Bent'. The accompanying blurb says: 'A tower is decorated with a set of fluorescent tubes which have been
programmed to light up in a complex and hypnotic display'

Here I Am, I Always Am, by Mark Murgatroyd (or some grilles covering a hole). The pranksters write alongside it: 'Casual passers-by are unlikely to realise the true purpose of this simple
and harmonious arrangement of grilles: beneath them an endurance
piece is in progress, in which the artist is trapped and gagged, facing
upwards'

Puddle water on a canvas has been grandly retitled 'Padiham and Wyre- Aspects of Beige'.  The 'collective' claim the piece is reminiscent of later Rothko 'but with less form and variation- creating a solemn and contemplative atmosphere'

HCAT satirises Metro's policy of playing muzak at Huddersfield Bus Station in 'Endless, Helpless' by 'Antonio Perogi'.

It says: 'Perogi's notorious sound installations imbue existing music with an effect opposite to that intended by its composers.

'In this instance, compositions designed to be calming and relaxing are piped into the waiting area of a busy bus station where they create a heightened sense of stress and irritation in their captive audience.'

Harry Chung - Timeless (which is actually just a photograph of stone slabs in a tower). Chung's outspoken works involve the removal and ritual destruction of an item of utilitarian value, and replacing it with something of no perceivable use in the context into which it is placed

'Mr Pozo' Stark Choices (stencils on a car park pillar). The blurb reads: 'Banksy's template-based techniques are here further abstracted by
"Mr Pozo", creating clean and simple motifs which are devoid of any
meaning other than the object they clearly represent'

'Andrea Wozinsky- Numbers 35 and 39, Springwood St Bricks'. 'Minimalist architect Wozinsky specialises in removing the clichés of urban dwellings, such as guttering, windows
and doors, creating living spaces permeated by an intense, if
claustrophobic, energy', the jokers write

Chipped emulsion on a staircase? Or Descent To Heaven, by Caroline Coot

Atkin Watendlath's 'Dog Hook'. The mickey taking modern art 'experts' say: ' This is typical of Watendlath's installations, where the nameplate is put on an equal or even greater footing than the work itself, therefore
effectively becoming part of the work'

The new-ish St George's Square and Kirklees Council also receive a bashing in 'The Emperor's New Art' by 'Lucy Grimes'.

It says: 'Kirklees Council's inventive response to savage cuts in its arts budget was to commission this massive, multilayered and adventurous sculpture which can only be seen by true art connoisseurs.'

A MapFodder spokesperson said: 'It's just a bit of fun, a piece of anonymous comedy.

Nishad Das - Evolving Informational: St George's Car Park. The artist  'ignores all conventions such as font size, orientation and consistency, and including random elements (small
panels, insulation tape and indistinct painted forms)'

Francine Beaumont- Beauty Spots Series 3: Location 20 (or a picnic table on a pavement).  'An object usually associated with pleasant rural scenery is placed into an area of urban blight'

This piece, entitled Come In! by Andrew Hagan, appears to be nothing more than some pictures of concrete

But the accompanying blurb calls the pictures an 'audacious piece which entirely subverts the notion of
the word'

Brick towers, re-imagined as modern art. A MapFodder spokesperson said: 'It's just a bit of fun, a piece of anonymous comedy'

'If it makes people laugh then it's worked...Yes, it is a bit of a mickey takeof poor contemporary art, but mainly of the pretentious blurb in galleries.

'Plus, I genuinely believe that some of this stuff could work as a piece of art.'

Town centre and Newsome councillor Andrew Cooper praised MapFodder.

He said: 'I love it. I came up with an idea for "misinterpretation boards" instead of interpretation boards.

'They might have too much time on their hands but it certainly highlights some of the issues.

'It's highlighting some of the areas that do need attention and if it brings them to people's attention that's great. It's quite Banksy-esque in the way it's quite subversive and I'm all for a bit of that.'
