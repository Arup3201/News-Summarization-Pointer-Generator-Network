Up to ten ebola cases could be seen in Britain by Christmas, the Health Secretary warned last night.

Jeremy Hunt told Parliament that the health crisis will get worse before it improves.

As the death toll in West Africa passed 4,000, Mr Hunt announced that screening for ebola will begin at Heathrow airport today.

International airports are already screening passengers for ebola - such as this Moroccan health worker using a thermometer at the arrivals hall of the Mohammed V airport in Casablanca

He told MPs: ‘In the next week, Public Health England will start screening and monitoring UK-bound air passengers identified by the Border Force coming on to the main routes from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

‘This will allow potential ebola virus carriers arriving in the UK to be identified, tracked and given rapid access to expert health advice should they develop symptoms.’

The World Health Organisation yesterday described the epidemic as the ‘most severe acute health emergency in modern times’ as the number of cases hit 8,400, killing 4,030.

Screening measures – a questionnaire followed by a possible medical examination and temperature check – will be introduced at Heathrow Terminal 1 today, followed later this week at Gatwick, Eurostar stations and other Heathrow terminals. 

Mr Hunt said the procedure should pick up 89 per cent of people travelling from the affected region, and it could be extended to Birmingham and Manchester if the risk increases.

Anyone who tests positive for ebola will be transferred to Royal Free Hospital in north London, where British nurse William Pooley, 29, was successfully treated when he contracted the virus in August.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the Government would collect mobile phone numbers from people potentially suffering from ebola

There are also plans to provide ebola ‘surge wards’ in Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield, to make a total of 26 beds available. ‘The situation will get worse before it gets better,’ he told the Commons.

Nurse: Nina Pham

The nurse who became the first person to catch ebola in the US breached safety protocols, officials believe.

Officials at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas insisted Nina Pham had been wearing full protective gear while treating Liberian Thomas Duncan, who died there last week after he had initially been sent home with antibiotics. Miss Pham, 26, was described as ‘clinically stable’ yesterday.

Federal officials said she may have caught the virus as she tried to take off her bulky protective gear without any of the material touching her skin, eyes, nose or mouth.

‘The care of ebola patients can be done but it’s hard to do it safely,’ said US disease control chief Dr Thomas Frieden.

He said it was ‘genuinely very difficult’ to predict an exact number of UK cases but, when pushed, said up to ten would be expected in the next three months. 

Mr Hunt admitted he could not guarantee UK patients would receive the experimental drug ZMapp that was given to Mr Pooley.

The Health Secretary also announced that calls to the NHS’s non-emergency 111 phoneline will be screened for potential ebola sufferers.

Medical experts have criticised the screening – which stops short of the automated temperature scanning introduced by the US – as a ‘political gesture’.

The ability of NHS hospitals to deal with ebola was called into question after reports that one patient suspected to have the virus was allowed to receive visitors and use a communal toilet and kitchen at Lewisham Hospital, South London.

The patient, later given the all-clear, was only isolated when staff reportedly refused to go near him. 

Mr Hunt said the case highlighted, ‘the importance of making sure that the guidance is widely understood’.

Underlining the potential turmoil, WHO director-general Margaret Chan said yesterday: ‘I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries.’
