More than 4,000 pop-culture enthusiasts have signed a petition to withdraw American actor Adam Baldwin's invitation from the upcoming event Supanova Pop Culture Expo.

The campaign, fuelled by Albert Santos, is demanding that the fan convention 'revoke' Baldwin as a 'supa-star guest' at the Sydney and Perth exhibitions in June as well as 'further events'.

It claims Baldwin was responsible for creating the hashtag 'GamerGate' that led to 'numerous instances of harassment and abuse towards women' in the past six months - claims that Baldwin says aren't true and defamatory of him.

Baldwin allegedly promoted  the movement that 'claims to be acting for 'journalistic integrity' but targets women, people of colour and the LGBTI+ community inside the gaming industry', the petition claims.

More than 5,000 pop-culture fans have signed a petition to 'revoke' US actor Adam Baldwin from Supanova

Best known for his roles in sci-fi series  Firefly and Serenity, the petition claims that Baldwin posted on his Twitter linked to videos that revealed private details of a number of female game developers  to his 'several thousand followers'.

While Santos concluded in the petition that Supanova has been an annual event for most of his childhood, dating back to his first appearance in 2003.

'I have always felt welcomed and loved by both the community, the variety of guests invited, and the family-friendly atmosphere that is harboured [sic],' Santos said in the petition.

'Knowing that someone that has not only harassed and intimidated people, but has led an entire online movement in doing so, will be there goes against those sentiments entirely,' Santos claims.

Others have defended the American actor by setting up another petition titled under: 'Don't revoke Adam Baldwin's invite to the Supanova Pop Culture Expo' - which has received 3,000 signatures.

With Baldwin expected to attend the convention and hold Q&A sessions and photo and signing opportunities, fans of the actor have flooded the Supanova page as they stand by his invitation.

'I think quite a few things he has said have been grossly taken out of context...'

'Dont spoil it for those of us who desperately want to see him.'

'Who cares we all have beliefs and what are we turning into an extended US state where the opinions of right or left wing sensationalism is taken for gods right! Please he is an amazing actor in many ways and his views are his own. I don't care.'

'If you don't like him, don't get his autograph and don't go to his panel.'

It follows after 'pick-up' artist Julien Blanc was rejected from holding his seminars across Australia

The controversial petition to ban Baldwin follows after 'pick-up' artist Julien Blanc was due to hold one of his seminars in Australia but was cancelled at the last minute.

Three Australian venues and two American hotels rejected appearances by Blanc after a social media campaign was brought to light, sparking outraged activists across the globe.

'Dating coach' Blanc who has been accused of using techniques such as choking women and then hushing them, had planned to hold his seminars in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in November last year. But Blanc has denied the allegations, saying it was meant to be a 'joke'.
