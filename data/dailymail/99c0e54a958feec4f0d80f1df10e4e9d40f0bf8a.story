As MailOnline's Fantasy Football season gets underway, we take a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

CARLOS SANCHEZ IN A NUTSHELL 

The tough-tackling midfielder considers Chelsea legend Claude Makelele as his hero and there are similarities in the way Sanchez approaches games.

He gained the nickname La Roca (The Rock) early on in his career due to the strength of his tackling and the tenacious manner in which he hunts for possession.

Not fazed: Sanchez made his debut for Villa as a second-half substitute against Newcastle on Saturday

Born: Quibdo, Colombia - February 6, 1986

Position: Defensive midfield

Career stats:   

2005–2007: River Plate Montevideo 40 appearances, 1 goal

2007–2013: Valenciennes 178 apps, 10 goals

2013–2014: Elche 30 apps, 0 goals

2014-: Aston Villa 1 app, 0 goals

International stats: 

48 appearances, 0 goals

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE SANCHEZ IN YOUR  FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM  

Sanchez was crucial for Colombia in qualifying for the World Cup in Brazil, and featured in four of their five games at the tournament including their quarter-final defeat to the hosts.

The 28-year-old will win tackles galore for Villa this season, and though he offers little in terms of a goal threat, his side will benefit defensively from his presence in front of the backline. 

THE GAME HE PROVED HIS WORTH IN 

Sanchez did a brilliant man-marking job on Lionel Messi when Colombia played Argentina in the Copa America in 2011, stopping the diminutive No 10 from influencing the game or getting on the scoresheet.

Making a name for himself: The 28-year-old moved to the Premier League from Spanish side Elche

Mixing it with the best: Sanchez tussles for possession with Barcelona star Lionel Messi in La Liga

BUT HOW WILL HE PICK UP POINTS? 

Villa conceded the fourth highest number of goals in the Premier League last season (61) and Lambert made it a priority to strengthen his squad defensively before the start of the new campaign. 

Sanchez's role will be to shield the Villa defence and stop them leaking so many goals over the course of the season, which should help propel them up the league. He will pick up points for every win and draw that Villa pick up.

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT 

Villa boss Paul Lambert was full of praise for the midfielder after he completed his move to the Midlands

'It was well documented that we were on the lookout for a defensive midfielder,' he said. 'I've watched a lot of his games to see if he fitted the bill and after seeing him once in training I realised that we have got a proper player on our hands.'

'He has not done much training since the World Cup but I think if you look at the World Cup and that Colombia team, he was someone that really captured the attention the way he played and fitted in that system.

'I know I have got a really top player on my hands here.'

Pedigree: Sanchez has played 48 times for Colombia and was part of Jose Pekerman's World Cup squad

HE'S A BETTER, CHEAPER VERSION OF... Victor Wanyama

Southampton midfielder Wanyama started his Premier League career well following his move from Celtic last year, but has influence has since waned, making his Fantasy Football price of £6.4million fairly high. 

The exodus from the St Mary's this summer has not helped the Kenya international and he has been linked with a move to Arsenal before the transfer window slams shut.

On the wane: Victor Wanyama has failed to live up to the hype after a decent start to life at Southampton
