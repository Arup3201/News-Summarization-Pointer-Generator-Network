From buying new outfits to spending hours applying their makeup, it seems that women are more interested in impressing other women  than the opposite sex on a night out.

Researchers found half of the British women polled in a new survey doll themselves up when they hit the town purely to impress their friends.

And one in twenty women said they care far more about the opinions of their best friends than that of their other half when it comes to make-up, hair and clothes.

Dress to impress: A new survey reveals that 50 per cent of British women polled  doll themselves up when they hit the town purely to impress their friends

In fact, nearly two thirds of women said getting a compliment from another woman meant much more than receiving one from a man they didn’t know.

The poll also found that eight in ten women get a genuine buzz when someone they don’t know compliments them on their image.

And when asked who gave the most genuine praise, a third said it was women that approached them when they were out and about. 

When it comes to compliments, one in ten women said other girls comment on their make-up the most, with one in twenty claiming their shoes got the most attention. But a quarter said it was their hair that attracted the most comments from their peers.

Men, meanwhile, are most likely to comment on a woman's chest area than anything else and often say ‘you look nice’ regardless of what women actually look like, according to 65 per cent of the women surveyed.

Complimentary: The poll also found that eight in ten women get a genuine buzz when someone they don't know compliments them on their image but canny women won't compliment their friends because they're jealous of their appearance 

When it comes to getting ready, the poll reveals the typical female will spend an hour and half preparing her hair for a night on the tiles.

Preparation: The poll reveals the typical female will spend an hour and half preparing her hair for a night on the tiles - and their footwear often receives a lot of compliments on a night out 

A further one hour and eight minutes will be spent showering and applying makeup and a further sixty minutes will be dedicated to choosing what to wear, totalling three hours and 38 minutes. 

The poll also found there is fierce competition between girlfriends over who goes to the longest lengths to look good.

Nearly one in ten of the ladies polled said there is rivalry over who looks the best amongst their group of girlfriends, although a more diplomatic 26 per cent said there was ‘friendly competition.’

But a competitive 15 per cent of women said they refuse to tell their girl pals they look nice and one in five said after a night out, they critique what one another was wearing. 

So jealous are these women that four in ten claim they often copy what their friends are wearing.   

A spokesperson for feelunique, who commissioned the research, said: 'It’s great that women are out to impress other women and not necessarily the opposite sex.

'The chances are other females will be a lot more in tune with make-up and style than men will be so it’s no wonder new clothes and the latest beauty look are lost on men.

'We know from our customers that women love woman to woman advice so it’s no surprise they’re out to impress the same sex.

'It’s sometimes great to hear from another woman that they love your new hairstyle – it can often mean you’re bang on trend.'
