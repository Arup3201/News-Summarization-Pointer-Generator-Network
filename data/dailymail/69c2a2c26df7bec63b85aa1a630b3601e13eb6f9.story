Manchester United defender Phil Jones is ready to prove himself a credible replacement for Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic as he prepares to become part of Louis van Gaal’s new three-man back line.

With Ferdinand and Vidic no longer at Old Trafford, it will be up to Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans to prove to new United boss Van Gaal that they are good enough to move his team forwards.

Van Gaal is hoping to buy at least one central defender between now and the start of the season – with Thomas Vermaelen and Mats Hummels under current consideration – as he looks to impose a new 3-5-2 system on the team he inherited from David Moyes.

In contention: Phil Jones started Louis van Gaal's first game in charge of Manchester United

Big chance: Jones wants to replace Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic who have left United

The system got its first airing in the 7-0 tour defeat of LA Galaxy here on Wednesday and Van Gaal has confirmed he will use it when United begin their Barclays Premier League campaign next month.

Last night Jones said: 'Of course, replacing those guys is ultimately what I want to be doing. Everyone is trying to impress and hopefully we can start the season off well.

‘You’ve got to thrive on the challenge.

‘We’ve lost two great defenders in Rio and Nemanja. But that’s football and we move on.

‘We’ve got good players to replace them and hopefully we can all step up and improve that.

‘You get used to a new system. This is the first time I’ve played three at the back.

‘Every manager has got his philosophy. We’re all pulling in the right direction and hopefully we’ll have a better season.

‘It’s not a massive difference to what you’re used to. You’re a defender and you’ve got to defend. We’ll keep working on it and I’m sure we’ll be ready come the start of the season.’

Van Gaal believes a 3-5-2 formation is the best way to get the maximum out of his attacking options.

Jones, though, knows he must cement a place in the side if he is to justify the fanfare that greeted his arrival from Blackburn in 2011.

The United manager has said he will look at everybody in the squad before buying players and Jones said: ‘That’s encouraging for everyone.

‘Everyone is trying to impress and it’s only right that we give everything we’ve got and prove to the manager that we’re worthy of starting the first game of the season.

‘The way this system works, if one of us goes in the other two have got to come round and cover.

‘But it’s the same when you’re playing two at the back, one goes up for a header and the other comes round.

‘Of course, as a defender you need a lot of communication. It’s about talking to the people around you and if we get that right we’ll be good.

‘The lads have been brilliant in training. The gaffer has told us how he wants us to play and the way he wants to play this season.

‘It’s a learning process but we’re all pulling in the right direction.’

United will arrive in Denver on Friday ahead of the second leg of their two-and-a-half week tour of America.
