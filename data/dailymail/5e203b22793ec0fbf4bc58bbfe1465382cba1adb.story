Fiona Woolf will lead the inquiry into historic child abuse 

The Lord Mayor of London, Fiona Woolf, will chair the government’s inquiry into historic child sex abuse, it was announced yesterday.

Mrs Woolf, 66, is a senior tax lawyer and former president of the Law Society. 

She will be advised by Professor Alexis Jay, who wrote last week’s report into child abuse in Rotherham.

She takes the place of Baroness Butler-Sloss, who stepped down in July after questions over her brother’s role as attorney general at the time of some of the events.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has campaigned on the issue, questioned whether Mrs Woolf has the ‘experience and knowledge’ to deal with ‘vulnerable, poor children’ who had been victims of abuse.

‘I would have preferred someone with at least a whiff of outsider to them,’ he told the BBC’s World at One.

But he said Mrs Woolf was an ‘intelligent, capable woman, who I have no doubt will do a good job’.

The inquiry, announced by Home Secretary Theresa May on July 7, will examine allegations senior Establishment figures covered up child sex abuse.

And it will look at why the police and other authorities did not properly investigate celebrity sex attackers such as Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith.

Mrs Woolf said: ‘Ensuring lessons are learned from the mistakes which have been made in the past and resulted in children being subjected to the most horrific crimes is a vital and solemn undertaking.

‘I was honoured to be approached to lead such an important inquiry, and look forward to working with the panel to ensure these mistakes are identified and never repeated.’

The inquiry is due to deliver an interim report before next year’s general election.
