The widow of America's most successful sniper Chris Kyle has proved that she is also a crack shot during a recent antelope hunting trip in honor of him.

Taya Kyle traveled to Wyoming with gun company, Weatherby Inc, to shoot the short film in memory of her late husband.

The ad was posted online on January 16, the same date that American Sniper was released in the U.S.

Entitled, He Is With Me, the camera follows Mrs Kyle, 40, as she stalks antelope dressed in camouflage gear and with a hunting rifle in the wild. She talks about her late husband's lifelong love of hunting throughout.

Mrs Kyle also proved to be a crack shot, just like her late husband, and bagged an antelope during the hunt

Mrs Kyle's late husband Chris Kyle, the SEAL veteran who is subject of blockbuster movie American Sniper. Mr Kyle, who was credited with saving hundreds of American lives, was killed by a veteran with PTSD in 2013

She said: 'I have a very different perspective on hunting because I know that peaceful side.

'And the more I do it, the more I fall in love with it. It is very beautiful, it’s peaceful, it’s nature at it’s best.'  

Mrs Kyle is seen shooting at herds of antelope and at the end of the clip, poses next to her kill with her hero husband's dog tags and wedding bands  visible.

She became emotional as she said: 'I do believe that Chris was with me. This hunt, I feel like he’s always with me, but sometimes more strongly than others.

'I feel that he’s proud, I feel that he’s happy, I feel like he has more answers than I do, so while there’s a part of me that has some regrets that we didn’t have more time or didn’t take more time to do this, I also know we did the best we could... it’s not the same but I know he’s with me.'

The widow has been seen a lot in public in recent weeks after the opening of American Sniper, the blockbuster movie starring Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, based on her husband's life. 

The movie, which has already earned at least $105million at the box office, has set a record for the highest-earning January opening and created a great deal of Oscar buzz.

The mother-of-two said that while on the hunt, she felt like her late SEAL veteran husband was with her every step of the way

The film tells the story of Mr Kyle, a sniper, who was credited with saving hundreds of American lives by making 160 confirmed kills,  the most in U.S. military history. 

In February 2013 after retiring from the military, Kyle and a friend, Chad Littlefield, took 25-year old Eddie Ray Routh, a veteran suffering with severe PTSD, to a remote shooting range in Glen Rose, Texas. 

Before they reached the range Routh, 25, shot both men dead and stole Kyle's customized pick-up truck. 

Since his death, Mrs Kyle, who has two children with her late husband, has been prolific in promoting his charity, the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation (the skeleton of a frog is the symbol for a fallen Navy SEAL).
