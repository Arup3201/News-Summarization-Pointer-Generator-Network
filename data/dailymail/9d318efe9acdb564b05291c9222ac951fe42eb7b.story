Two Twitter accounts belonging to the Ku Klux Klan have been taken over by hacker group Anonymous after the white supremacist group threatened protesters in Ferguson.

Anonymous acted after the group distributed flyers threatening 'lethal force' against the protesters who have rallied in the lead up to the grand jury decision on whether Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson will be charged.

Protesters had gathered around St.Louis while they await what many believe will be a no-indictment vote in relation to the shooting of teenager Michael Brown. Anonymous has previously announced that Wilson will not be charged.

Anonymous launched a 'cyber war' called Operation KKK and would make further announcements

Michael Brown, 18, was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson more than 100 days ago

ZDNet also reported that Anonymous has compromised Ku Klux Klan members email accounts and is harassing members by phone. Member's personal information was also thought to have been released. The Twitter accounts taken over are @KuKluxKlanUSA and @YourKKKCentral.

Last week, a Ku Klux Klan group based 75 miles out of Ferguson, passed out pamphlets that reported stated, 'Attention: To the terrorists masquerading as 'peaceful protesters!'

It went on to read: 'We will use lethal force as provided under Missouri law to defend ourselves.'

The head of Missouri's KKK, Frank Ancona, later boasted that the threats had boosted the group's recruitment. 

The Missouri group behind the threats - Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan - is listed as an active hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Anonymous is said to have compromised Ku Klux Klan members email accounts and is harassing members by phone. Members' personal information was also thought to have been released.

The Ku Klux Klan taunted the hacker group, and had said their threats had boosted recruitment 

In a video published by Anonymous on YouTube, which has since been taken down by the website, the group said it had come to their attention that the KKK had been 'interfering with Anonymous'.

The hacker group said: 'We are not attacking you because of what you believe in as we fight for freedom of speech.

'We are attacking you because of what you did to our brothers and sisters at the Ferguson protest on the 12th of November.'

Anonymous said they had launched Operation KKK, which it said was 'nothing more than cyber warfare'.

The group warned: 'Anything you upload will be taken down, anything you use to promote the KKK will be shut down.'

Anonymous said they had 'infiltrated' the KKK's servers and would release 'all information retrieved' to the public. 

Preparation: Demonstrators lay on the ground in a mock death protest of the shooting of Brown. The area around St. Louis, Missouri, is preparing for the grand jury decision in the shooting death of Brown

A crowd of a couple hundred
demonstrators, angry about the fatal August shooting  took to the
streets of St. Louis yesterday, briefly blocking a major
intersection in protest.

Dozens of people lay down in the street outside of a
downtown theater hosting a film festival, pretending to have
been shot by other demonstrators playing the role of police officers
in an action intended to evoke the memory of 18-year-old Brown, who died 100 days ago in front of his home in the suburb
of Ferguson.

Marchers went on to briefly block a major intersection near
Washington University and the event ended without any of the
violence that was seen in Ferguson following Brown's shooting death
by police officer Darren Wilson. 

A grand jury, sitting in the county seat of Clayton,Missouri, is currently deliberating whether to bring criminal charges against Wilson. Many residents and officials in the region fear another wave of rioting similar to the one in August that led to the burning out of multiple businesses if the grand jury decides not to charge Wilson.

'We are bracing for that possibility. That is what many people are expecting. The entire community is going to be upset,' if Wilson is not indicted, said Jose Chavez, 46, a leader of the local Latinos en Axion group. 

There have been conflicting witness accounts of the
shooting, with some saying that Brown had his hands up in
surrender while others have described it as a struggle
between Brown and Wilson.  

From Boston to Los Angeles, police departments are bracing for large demonstrations when the grand jury decides. 

In Los Angeles, rocked by riots in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers in the videotaped beating of Rodney King, police officials say they've been in touch with their counterparts in Missouri, where Gov. Jay Nixon and St. Louis-area law enforcement held a news conference this week on their own preparations.
