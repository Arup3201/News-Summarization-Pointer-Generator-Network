Dozens of Tory MPs are threatening to defy David Cameron by voting against plans for plain cigarette packets

Dozens of Tory MPs are threatening to defy David Cameron by voting against plans for plain cigarette packets.

Priti Patel, a member of the Prime Minister’s own policy advisory board, is leading the charge - warning it will be the ‘final nail in the coffin’ of hundreds of newsagents.

Rebels say around 40 Conservative backbenchers may vote against what they regard as a nanny state measure. If that happens, it would dwarf this week’s rebellion against the controversial HS2 rail line.

Public health minister Jane Ellison announced last month (April) that shops would be forced to sell cigarettes in plan packaging within a year.

Fifty MPs, most of them Tory, have signed a Commons motion against plain packaging - an indication of the scale of backbench anger.

A large rebellion would be another sign of Mr Cameron’s poor grip on party discipline. Most famously, House of Lords reform - part of the Coalition agreement with a Liberal Democrats - had to be dropped when backbenchers refused to back it.

As well as being one of the Prime Minister’s advisers on the Number 10 Policy Unit, Miss Patel is chairwoman of the all-party parliamentary group on small shops.

Last night she said: ‘This is a very, very anti-Conservative thing to do.

‘It is completely mad. Plain packaging is a blunt instrument which will have a disproportionate impact on independent retailers.

‘All this will do is that it will boost the number of illicit cigarettes, meaning it will actually be easier for children to purchase them.’

Rob Halfon, another Tory backbencher, said: ‘Fifteen thousand people die of alcohol abuse every year, but are we going to have brown paper bags over alcohol bottles?

‘This decision will simply increase the black market and create a new business in fancy cigarette cases, rather than dealing with the problem.’

Miss Ellison went for plain packaging after commissioning a report from former paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler, which said there was ‘very strong evidence’ from Australia that plain packaging protects youngsters.

No date has yet been set for a Commons vote on the policy. Rebels hope their pressure will force the government into a U-turn before a vote is held.

In a letter to Asian Trader magazine two weeks ago, Miss Patel accused ministers of wishing to ‘steamroll stricter tobacco controls and plain packaging through with no further debate or consideration, under the pretence that this will in some way prevent young people from taking up smoking’.

She said: ‘Plain packaging will serve to harm the very businesses that are best-placed to prevent underage sales and fight back against illegal and illicit supplies.

‘Independent retailers are already being clobbered by the burdens of tobacco regulation.

‘Next year, the point of sale display ban comes into effect for small shops, while over the next couple of years the provisions of the European Union’s tobacco products directive will be felt by them.

‘Packs of 10 and small pouches of roll-your-own tobacco under 20 grams are to be banned. These products already make up a sizeable share of newsagents’ trade.

‘On top of this, the EU is also demanding that at least 65 per cent of a cigarette packet contains picture and health warnings.

‘With so much of a cigarette packet already set to effectively become standardised with health warnings, the likelihood of the removal of remaining branding making a significant difference to reducing the prevalence of smoking is highly unlikely.’

She added: ‘New plain packaging rules that go further than this would only serve to be another nail in the coffin for many newsagents.

‘We are a proud nation of shopkeepers, with newsagents forming the backbone of many local communities.

‘Many are already struggling for survival, and unnecessary additional tobacco regulation should be avoided to help these businesses continue to serve their communities and create local jobs.’

On Monday, 35 Tory MPs voted against the government’s plans for a high speed rail link from London to Birmingham.
