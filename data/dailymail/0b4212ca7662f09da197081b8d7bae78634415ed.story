Dozens of Ukraine's most dangerous prisoners have escaped from a high-security jail after it was hit by shelling in Donetsk.

Authorities say one prisoner was killed while 106 inmates escaped from the jail, on the western outskirts of the besieged Ukrainian city, after it was hit during fighting between government forces and separatist rebels.

City council spokesman Maxim Rovensky today said  a riot broke out at the jail after it was hit by a direct rocket, which also left three inmates injured.

Ukrainian government forces have over the past week intensified their push on Donetsk and have succeeded in surrounding it. 

Exchanges of rocket fire have become a daily feature of the fighting.

Rovensky said at least 10 homes, shops and garages were hit by overnight rocketing. He added that 20,000 people are living without electricity.

A military spokesman today said Ukrainian government forces were preparing for the final stage of recapturing the city from pro-Russian separatist rebels after making significant gains that have divided rebel forces. 

The spokesman, Andriy Lysenko, said Kiev's forces had now cut Donetsk off from the other main rebel-held city of Luhansk on the border with Russia.

'The forces of the "anti-terrorist operation" are preparing for the final stage of liberating Donetsk. Our forces have completely cut Donetsk off from Luhansk. We are working for liberating both towns but it's better to liberate Donetsk first - it is more important,' Lysenko told Reuters.
