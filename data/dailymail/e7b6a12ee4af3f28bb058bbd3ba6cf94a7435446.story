Fraud: John Darwin has been forced to pay the State £40,000 from his newly matured pension pot

The man who faked his own death in a canoe accident in order to claim life insurance was today ordered to pay back £40,000 in compensation.

John Darwin has so far repaid just £121 of the £679,073.62 he gained from the scam, which he orchestrated with his wife Anne.

But after two private pensions matured, Teesside Crown Court ruled that he would have to hand over thousands of pounds to the Crown.

Darwin, 63, from Hartlepool, did not challenge the application by the Crown to have the money removed from his bank accounts.

Although the pensions were legitimately earned by Darwin during his work as a teacher and a prison officer, officials were still granted access to them in order to pay off the money he owes to the State.

Prosecutor Jolyon Perks said that the defendant would have to hand over any money he manages to earn in the future.

'We believe it sends a strong signal to those who seek to benefit from their criminal conduct that these orders have teeth,' he said.

'They will be pursued and they will be rigourously enforced. The Proceeds of Crime Act is intended to be draconian.'

Anne Darwin, who has now split from her husband, has repaid more than £500,000 under a separate order, and still owes another £177,000.

The couple were both jailed for fraud after it emerged that they had made a false claim on Darwin's life insurance even though he was still alive and living in Panama.

Outside court today, Tommy Maughan from the North East Regional Asset Recovery Team said: 'I'm pleased with the outcome today - Mr Darwin has now seen first-hand the full force of the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation in action.

'It's a robust law that allows police and prosecutors to make sure those who have benefited from crime pay back what they owe until their debt is paid.

'The court assessed how much John Darwin benefited from crime some time ago, and today they have taken into account recently identified assets which the Judge has agreed can be confiscated.

'His full benefit from crime has still not been paid off, and if he comes into any substantial assets in the future we will again consider asking the court to revisit the Confiscation Order granted against him in 2009.

'Criminals should be warned that even if assets are gained legitimately this legislation can be used and their crimes may just come back to haunt them.'

Partner in crime: Anne Darwin was jailed for her part in her husband's life insurance fraud

John Darwin left his children heartbroken when he failed to return from a canoeing trip near his home in Seaton Carew on Teesside in March 2002.

He was reported missing, and after the wreckage of his canoe was found the next day he was officially presumed dead - allowing his wife Anne to claim thousands in life insurance.

She used the money to repay the couple's debts and wipe out their mortgage - but in fact, John was living next door the whole time.

In 2006, they moved to Panama, where they bought a tropical estate which they planned to turn into a hotel specialising in canoeing holidays.

However, the next year Darwin decided he had to come back into the open in order to secure a long-term visa to continue living in Panama.

He walked into a London police station in December 2007 - to the shock of his sons, who had assumed him long dead.

Although Anne initially pretended not to have seen him for five years, a photograph soon emerged of the couple together in Panama, and their scam was exposed.

In July 2008, the Darwins were convicted of fraud and sentenced to more than six years in prison each.
