His celebration delighted the home crowd, but not the officials. Gavin Rumgay gave himself a ‘wedgie’  after fighting back from two games down to beat Canada’s Pierre-Luc Theriault in the men’s team event of the table tennis.

The 29-year-old said: ‘I’m just in the zone and it happened. I got a warning and a yellow, but it’s a funny yellow card.’
