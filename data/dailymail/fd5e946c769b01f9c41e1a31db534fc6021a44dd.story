The first ever drag show performed at a US military base was hailed as a resounding success over the weekend - but predictably, some were outraged.

On Saturday, six gay, straight and lesbian servicemen and women slapped on the makeup to dance and lip-sync their way through hits such as 'I Wanna Dance with Somebody' at the Rocker NCO Club at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa to raise money for the military's largest LGBT nonprofit advocate.

Expecting to sell only 75 tickets, the organizers welcomed 400 people to the show, which has been criticized by former Republican Congressman Allen West, who attacked the Pentagon for worrying about 'hair and makeup for our gay military' while Russia overwhelms the Ukraine.

Before: The drag show was the first ever time that a performance of its kind has been seen at a US Military base ever

The historic event, the first since the 2011 repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, is a step forward for the military which has hosted gay marriage ceremonies and dinners for LGBT servicemen and women, but never a drag show.

On Saturday night, the Rocker club was rammed for performances by serving members with stage names such as Chocolate Sunrise and Artemis Faux. 

The event’s sole lesbian performer took the drag king name Manny Nuff.

Raising money for the Okinawa chapter of OutServe-SLDN, the group were stunned weeks ago when the event starring drag kings and drag queens was approved - but as a 'variety show'.

Popular: The organizers of the show feared that they wouldn't sell more than 100 tickets for the performance but they ended up with a packed house of 400 people

Pioneering: The show has been hailed as a huge success by the organizers and by those who attended who said that sexual orientation is not an issue in the military for servicemen and women

The advocacy group agreed not to use the term 'drag show' on the base, but those who attended were left in little doubt that it was.

'We didn’t think there was much of a desire for an event like this on the island but it has actually blown up,' said Navy Lt. Marissa Greene, co-chapter leader of OutServe Okinawa to Stars and Stripes magazine.

Expecting less than 100 people to arrive, Greene was stunned when they sold 400 tickets in ten days.

Indeed, the unexpected success of the show highlights the changing attitudes within the military to its LGBT members, as gay civil rights reach a pivotal moment across the nation - with many states passing laws legalizing marriage.

Make-up: The show was weeks in the planning for  the new Okinawa chapter of OutServe-SLDN, an advocacy organization for LGBTs in the U.S. military

It is also a huge moment for the American military. Just three years ago, a gay, lesbian or drag performance on a military base would have been unthinkable and could have led to dismissal from the armed forces.

But the repeals of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, as well as the Defense of Marriage Act now mean that gay and lesbian people can be open about their sexuality and serve the military at the same time.

However, all are not convinced by the openness the military is now beginning to display.

Former Republican Congressman Allen West said that he was 'kinda at a loss for words' over the fundraiser for members of the military.

On Saturday, servicemembers on OKinawa were the first to take to the stage and perform as drag queens on a military installation in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender troops

Songs: The show was a resounding success but carefully avoided any mentions of politics

In a post on his website following the show, which West called, 'Our Gay Military Dances in Drag in Okinawa', the politician seemed threatened and frightened for America's military past and future.

Annoyed that the show took place on Okinawa, 'the scene of one of the most ferocious and protracted battles of World War II - a site of legendary valor and sacrifice on the part of American soldiers', West was withering in his surmising of the show.

'Some US service personnel stationed in Okinawa today are treating the world to another kind of display: Gay and lesbian service personnel performing in drag, to raise for their activities, to a sellout audience.'

West goes as far to claim that the since the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the rate of sexual assaults in the military and especially male-on-male sexual assaults has 'skyrocketed'.

Backing up West's scathing opinion of the show, Right Wing News called the performance 'disgusting' and went as far as to make very derogatory remarks regarding the performance.

Tech. Sgt. Kristen Baker, who was among the crowd, said the show got a great reception and was important for civil rights.

'Everything is just accepted. It makes me really proud to watch it,' Baker said.

In the military, 'we are all brothers and sisters no matter what.'
