When answering calls, do you find raising your hand all the way to your ear too strenuous?

If so, a new gadget to come out of Israel could solve your problems by letting you only reach half way.

Dubbed Fonhandle, the device is essentially an iPhone case with a long plastic handle attached.

As well as making phone calls easier, the device could also transform your image by helping you take a perfect selfie from a different angle.

It was created by Yonatan Assouline, an entrepreneur in Tel Aviv, who says the device is ‘the chicest, hottest, girliest, manliest way to hold and handle your phone.’

Mr Assouline has created a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for Fonhandle, which are selling for £7.60 ($13).

The device comes in six colours – black, white, clear, pink, green and brown – and currently all models are made for iPhone 5/5S.

Monopods designed especially for smartphones were unveiled at this year’s Mobile World Congress, including a Samsung version.

It is a trend that's especially popular in Asia, including Indonesia.

A number of existing monopods can be used with iPhones, from companies including Interfit.

They work by holding the camera in landscape mode, with the screen facing the photographer and using the front-facing camera.

Buttons on the handle of the stick are used to control the device.

‘Fonhandle is inspired by hafting, the act of attaching artefacts to a handle which turns them into useful objects,’ Mr Assouline says.

‘Humans have used this method throughout history to turn rock, metal and bone into axes and hammers, then later on – simple lenses into magnifying glasses, and then – rubber nets into fly swatters.

‘Now it is time to do the same with the most useful object of all – the smartphone.’

Mr Assouline adds that it could opens a world of new photographic and videographic opportunities, as well as easier web browsing and other uses that have yet been discovered.

The crowd-funding campaign is $1,909 towards its $22,000 goal, and has 44 days remaining.
