After taking a long, hard look at some of America's biggest cities, Kink University has determined Portland, Oregon is the nation's kinkiest town. 

The Pacific Northwest city topped the list for having the largest population of kink-identified people with 3.99 per cent considered to be among the adventurously amorous. 

Kink University used four criteria: 'the total size of the kink-identified population, the size of the population relative to the city's size, the number of resources available for kink-identified people, and the adult entertainment purchases in each city.'

Coming in a close second was San Francisco, wrote the Huffington Post.

'San Francisco is usually seen as the center of kink life in the United States, but rising housing costs resulting from the tech boom seem to have pushed the community northward,' according to King University spokesperson Mike Stabile. 

Rounding out the top ten from most to least kinky are New York City, Chicago, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, and Los Vegas.

The site has online and real-life workshops.
