Spacewalking astronauts who ventured out for the third time in just over a week on Sunday have completed an extensive, tricky cable job at the International Space Station. 

But, dramatically, right before Sunday's spacewalk, engineers spotted problems with American astronaut Butch Wilmore's suit.

While it had functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks, on Sunday morning, a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out.

Maintenance: Barry Wilmore and Terry Virts begin their third spacewalk at the International Space Station

Work: Astronaut Terry Virts installs an antenna and boom during the third spacewalk outside the International Space Station Sunday

Space Station: An astronaut is pictured at the International Space Station, the spacewalk is the third in eight days for NASA, and is the 187th in the history of the space station

Repair: Astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore, right, and Terry Virts carried out the work but both had problems with their suits before their mission but none during the task

A mechanical gauge, however, was operating fine. Mission Control told Wilmore that he would need to pay extra attention to how his suit was feeling throughout the seven-hour excursion.

Meanwhile, Nasa said a small amount of water got into American astronaut Terry Virts helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurized on Wednesday. 

They were forced to spend two days analyzing his suit after the water leak  occurred at the end of an outing earlier this week.

Engineers concluded it was the result of condensation, and a safe and well understood circumstance that had occurred several times before with the same spacesuit. 

Virts was never in danger, according to Nasa, so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks, Friday, to install cable.

But in 2013, another astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet. 

Duties: NASA said another main part of the astronauts task was to route 400 feet (121 meters) of cable

Leak: In this file image made from video provided by Nasa, astronaut Terry Virts points to his helmet as he sits inside the International Space Station on Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2015, during an inspection for water in his suit. Virts reported the water while he waited in the air lock for Wednesday's spacewalk to formally conclude

Italian astronaut, Luca Parmitano, barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk.

The water escaped from his suit's cooling system and Nasa spent months investigating the mishap, before clearing the way for more spacewalks.

On Wednesday, the amount of water seepage in Virts' helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when Virts was already inside.

'They're very different occurrences,' said Alex Kanelakos, a spacewalk officer in Mission Control. 

Cable: American astronauts Terry Virts and Butch Wilmore had 400 more feet of power and data cable, as well as two antennas which they installed Sunday

The advance work, involving nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks was carried out to create new crew capsules commissioned by Nasa.

The work done by American astronauts Virts and Wilmore meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed, as well as two antennas installed on Sunday.

A pair of docking ports will fly up later this year, followed by the capsules themselves, with astronauts aboard, in 2017. 

The astronauts successfully routed 364 feet on their first two excursions, on February 21 and last Wednesday. 

They carried out complicated work Sunday, yet the astronauts completed their task  an hour early  making it a five and a half-hour spacewalk. 

They spent 20 hours altogether on three outings.

Neither Virts nor Wilmore experienced any more suit trouble during their task. Mission Control joked by radio: 'You guys have done an outstanding job even for two shuttle pilots.'

The 260-mile (418-kilometre) spacewalk unfolded 50 years to the month of the world's first spacewalk by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov  on March 18, 1965.

Nasa hasn't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days, and the amount of cable work is unprecedented.

Even more spacewalks will be needed once new docking ports start arriving in June. 

Wilmore is due to return to Earth next week following a five and a half-month mission. Virts is midway through his expedition. 

A Russian Soyuz spacecraft carried them both up, with NASA paying for the multimillion dollar tickets.

To save money and stop being so reliant on the Russian Space Agency, NASA has hired Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the space station. 

The two contracts are worth nearly $7 billion. SpaceX already is delivering cargo under a separate agreement with Nasa.
