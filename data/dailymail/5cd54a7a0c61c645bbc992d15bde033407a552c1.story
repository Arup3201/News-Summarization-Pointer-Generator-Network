Cashing in: Bookies are taking bets on everything from the baby's birthday to its name and hair colour

First everyone was convinced it was July 13, then July 19, but whatever the Duchess of Cambridge's actual due date, one thing is certain: there is still no royal baby.

And that means bookies are cashing in as thousands of pounds are lost by those who were certain Kate's revelation she was due 'mid July' meant the baby would arrive last week.

Bookmakers said the most popular day for due-date bets was Thursday, July 18, when 1,142 people lost money with Ladbrokes alone.

One punter in Wiltshire is £1,000 down after putting their money on July 17.

The company said it will make £23,000 if the baby isn't born by midnight tonight, while Coral told the Sunday Telegraph it had made £25,000 from lost bets.

William Hill said it had already taken £100,000 in due date bets but could not say how many people had lost out as all bets remain open until the baby is born.

The bookmaker has now stopped taking bets on when the baby will arrive, and said the majority of people had bet on it being tomorrow.

Spokesman Joe Crilly said: 'The money would suggest that it will be Monday 
or Tuesday at the very latest.'

Jessica Bridge, from Ladbrokes, said: 'In an ideal world we'd love it if Kate and Wills have completely pulled the wool over our eyes and are actually expecting a late July or early August baby, because all the mathematicians and media thought it would be an early birthday and so that's where all the money went.'

Yesterday William Hill revealed it had seen a surge in bets for a due date in August, as punters appeared to decide the baby would have to be induced.

Doctors do not normally induce births until two weeks after the due date, which would be August 2 if the Duchess was due on July 19.

Bookies are also taking bets on everything from the baby's name to its hair colour, and whether William or Kate will be holding it when they first emerge from hospital.

Expecting: The Duchess of Cambridge's due date was first reported to be July 13 and then July 19

Long wait: Reporters have resorted to interviewing each other as they wait outside the hospital. Here, ABC Today Program's Amy Robach and Lama Hassan speak to Sky's Royal Correspondent Paul Harrison

Waiting game: The world's press has been camped outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London for a fortnight, and social media is continually awash with rumours that she has gone into labour

The Duchess of Cornwall said on Monday she was expecting the baby 'by the end of the week', suggesting it could arrive today.

However, on Wednesday the Queen appeared to suggest that the baby was already late.

She told a 10-year-old schoolgirl on a trip to Cumbria: 'I would very much like it to arrive because I’m going on holiday 
soon... I wish it would hurry up.'

William and Kate's private office at 
Kensington Palace has refused to confirm the Duchess's exact due date, 
although Kate herself let slip during a public walkabout earlier this 
year that it is 'mid-July'.

William
was said to have had a few days off from his job as an RAF Search and 
Rescue pilot in Wales this week, which he was thought to have spent with
his wife at their Kensington Palace residence.

However, Kate,
31, has also been staying at the home of her parents Carole and Michael Middleton in 
Berkshire.

Thrilled: Fay Batey (left) asked the Queen: 
'Would you like the baby to be a boy or a girl?' To which the Queen 
replied she would like the royal baby to 'hurry up' before she goes off 
on holiday to Balmoral next week

The world's press has been camped 
outside the Lindo Wing, at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where the 
Duchess is expected to give birth, for over a fortnight.

Reporters have resorted to interviewing each other while they wait for news that Kate has gone into labour.

The packed press area has itself 
become a tourist attraction for visitors to London, and those who drop 
by are interviewing and pictured by the waiting press.

Outside the hospital scores of royal fans from Britain and all over the world are waiting for the royal arrival.

Pat and Norman Bate took two months to
get to St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington because the retired fruit and 
veg merchants travelled from their Liverpool home to London via 
Britain’s canal network  at four mph.

Their 55ft canal boat Ellie May, is moored just behind the royal 
hospital, filled with bagfuls of cards and presents for the baby, and its cabin draped with bunting.

‘As soon as we heard Kate was pregnant, I
said that we should aim to get there for the birth, so we left home on 
May 1,’ Mrs Bate said.

‘And we hope to be here as long as it takes. After
all, we’re not paying for a hotel.’

Terry
Hutt is now in his second week of living on a wooden bench opposite the
street entrance to the Lindo Wing, St Mary’s private maternity unit.

The
retired carpenter from  Cambridge has been a familiar fixture at major 
royal events for years, always dressed head to toe in Union Jack clothes
beneath a Union Jack umbrella hat. The Royal Family, he says, know him 
as ‘The Umbrella Man’.

Terry,
78, has been here so long that, a few days ago, he felt compelled to 
take himself back to Cambridge for a bath and a change of clothes. He 
then returned to London with enough spare Union Jack kit to last him as 
long as it takes.

‘What’s another week?’ he says. ‘It’s not boring and it gives my wife a rest from me.’

NBC presenter Natalie Morales has been knitting a pink bootie live on NBC’s flagship Today programme.

‘I think it may be even bigger news at home than it is here,’ she said, adding: ‘Once Kate goes into labour,’ she says, ‘we’ll be sleeping 
right here.’
