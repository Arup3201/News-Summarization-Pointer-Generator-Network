Franz Beckenbauer is certain English clubs are not in the midst of a Euro-crisis despite the domino crash which culminated in Everton's five-goal hammering in Kiev.

The Merseysiders, the last representatives of the Barclays Premier League in European competition this season, lost 5-2 against Dynamo Kiev and went out of the Europa League with a 6-4 aggregate defeat.

It leaves English football with no teams in the last eight of either trophy for the first time in 22 years.

'It is a temporary problem,' said Beckenbauer. 'I am not very happy because there are no English teams in the quarter-finals. But in Germany we are having the same debate. We almost have the same problems.

'We had four teams in the Champions League but only one has survived, Bayern Munich.

'Last year the Bundesliga teams were very successful. And two years before when the final was held at Wembley, we had two teams in the final and everybody said we had the best league in the world.

'It is temporary. Sometimes you are very unlucky and you get defeated. Next year is another year.'

Beckenbauer was speaking at the launch of Gazprom's third annual 'Football for Friendship' initiative.

He is a global ambassador for the international children's social project, which brings young footballers together from 24 different countries around Europe and will offer many of them the chance to attend the Champions League final in Berlin on June 6.

The showpiece will take place without an English team but Beckenbauer, an honorary president for Bayern Munich, a club he served as a legendary captain and manager, will be hoping for a German victory on home soil.

'I hope Bayern Munich will be there opposite whoever, this is my dream,' he said. 'If they are in the final, I will keep my fingers crossed because I am the president and I have to support my team. But there is a long way to go.'

Wolfsburg are Germany's only team left in the last eight of the Europa League. Â
