A company selling furniture used by athletes during last year’s Olympic Games has been flooded with complaints after failing to deliver the goods on time, or even give refunds.

Some items that were ordered from Ramler Furniture five months ago and intended as Christmas presents still have not arrived. Meanwhile customers who wanted a refund could not get hold of anyone from the company for several months.

A contact phone number was removed from the website and people with complaints were not getting any response by email. Hundreds of customers left messages on the company’s Facebook page before getting a reply.

Ramler Furniture, which supplied the Olympic venues and the Athletes’ Village, began selling the goods last August as part of its contract with the London 2012 organisers.

The company offered more than one million items, ranging from beds that Olympic stars such as Jessica Ennis and Usain Bolt could have slept in, to bean bags, bathroom bins and even coat hangers. 

Customers began buying the items through a website called Remains of the Games. At its peak in August and September, the website was receiving 10,000 visits a day from customers, who expected delivery of the goods within the industry standard of 28 days.

But hundreds of people are still waiting for their items to arrive.

Ramler, which has apologised for the fiasco, says it has now paid back almost £100,000 in refunds, and is frantically trying to deliver the remainder of the goods to other customers.

A spokesman said that of the 500 customers who complained, almost 200 were still waiting for goods or refunds. The company has sold more than 700,000 items.

LOCOG, the Games organising 
committee, said it had been unaware of the problems until  contacted by 
The Mail on Sunday this weekend, and that it was now monitoring Ramler’s
performance with ‘concern’. Customers say the experience has left a 
‘sour taste’ in their mouths.

Ramler, an Australian company, provided most of the furniture for the Games venues and the Athletes’ Village.

The
Village contained 17,000 beds, which were up for sale, along with 6,900
bean bags, and 5,000 dining chairs. Ramler was also selling rugs of the
fake grass used in Danny Boyle’s Opening Ceremony at £95 each.

When
customers ordered their goods, they were told by Remains of the Games 
staff that their order would either be ready for collection at two 
depots in Nottingham or Tilbury, Essex, or delivered in a few weeks.

But
by the end of September, customers could not contact Remains of the 
Games by phone because the number had been removed from the website.

Karen Roberts, 51, from Gravesend, Kent, said she ordered three wall clocks, one floor lamp, two notice boards and a deck chair  for £280 in August, but had not received anything by this month.

She sent 29 emails to Ramler, and eventually left an angry message on its Facebook page, threatening to go to Trading Standards. 

Going, going, gone: Ramler Furniture sold off more than one million items varying from beds, bean bags and even coat-hangers from the athletes' village

Within hours, she received a refund into her PayPal account.

Mrs Roberts said: ‘On a scale of one to ten on how bad their service was, I would give them 11. It did feel like a scam. It was just frustrating. I just wanted something to remember the Olympics by.’

Her sister Alison Thompson, 42, said she bought an umbrella for £9 and a locker from an athlete’s bedroom for £24. The locker, ordered in September, was meant to be a Christmas present for her 12-year-old daughter Jordan.

She said: ‘We’ve managed to get a refund, but it’s not the money  I care about. We really wanted a memento from the Games.’

Ramler spokesman Paul Levin said the main reason for the delay in delivering orders was that  beds and chairs were not being returned on schedule as workers cleared the Olympic Village.

He added that many items were not fit to be delivered because they were damaged or stained. Mr Levin said: ‘I apologise to customers for the delay.’
