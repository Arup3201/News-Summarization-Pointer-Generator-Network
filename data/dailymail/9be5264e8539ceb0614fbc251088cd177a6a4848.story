Five cups of coffee a day may keep the doctor away, according to a new government health report.

A panel of experts from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which convenes every five years, did a detailed assessment of the caffeinated beverage for the first time.

They concluded that a trusty cup of Joe could have various health benefits, including reduced  risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's and liver cancer.

Drink up! Five cups of coffee a day may keep the doctor away, according to a new government health report

The amount the report recommends drinking is three to five cups a day, while pregnant women should limit their intake to two cups a day.

There was found to be no added benefit from exceeding these limits.

Americanos appear to be the way to go, as the panel note that high-calorie creams, milks and sugars could diminish the potential positive health effects.

The report concludes that moderate coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy lifestyle.

Although, individuals who do not consume java should not start consuming it for health benefits alone.

Tom Brenna, a member of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and a nutritionist at Cornell University, said the findings put a new spin on coffee, which has traditionally been panned by health experts.

'Coffee’s good stuff,' he told Bloomberg, adding: 'I don’t want to get into implying coffee cures cancer - nobody thinks that.

'But there is no evidence for increased risk, if anything, the other way around.' 

The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee helps the U.S. government formulate dietary guidelines that affect millions of American diets, from school lunches to food package labels.

The U.S. is the one world’s biggest consumers of coffee. 

According to a 2014 survey by National Coffee Association, 61per cent of Americans sip on a cup of the good stuff each day. 

Despite the focus on coffee, the Dietary Guidelines A

dvisory Committee's latest report sticks to the basic message of the previous guidelines in 2010: Eat more fruits and vegetables and whole grains; eat less saturated fats, salt and sugar.

The 2015 dietary guidelines are set to be issued by the end of the year. 

EGGS ARE OK

The report says dietary cholesterol now is 'not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.' This follows increasing medical research showing the amount of cholesterol in your bloodstream is more complicated than once thought.

The committee says available evidence 'shows no appreciable relationship' between heart disease and how much dietary cholesterol you eat, but it still recommends eating less saturated fat. As in previous years, the report advises limiting saturated fats to 10 percent of total calories.

The panel doesn't give a specific recommendation for how much cholesterol - or eggs - a person may eat.

WATCH THE ADDED SUGAR

Added sugars should be around 200 calories a day - about the amount in one 16-ounce sugary drink, says the advisory committee, which is made up of doctors and nutritionists.

The recommendation is part of a larger push in recent years to help consumers isolate added sugars from naturally occurring ones like those in fruit and milk. Added sugars generally add empty calories to the diet.

Americans now get about 13 per cent of their calories from added sugar, or 268 calories a day, the committee says. Older children, adolescents and young adults generally take in more. The committee recommends ten per cent, which is 'a target within reach,' says Miriam Nelson, a Tufts University professor of nutrition who served on the panel.

Sugary drinks should be replaced with water instead of those with low-calorie sweeteners; there's not enough evidence those drinks can help with weight loss, the committee advises.

A SOFTER APPROACH ON SALT

Sodium adds up quickly. A turkey sandwich and a cup of soup can average about 2,200 milligrams. That's just under the committee's recommendation of 2,300 milligrams a day for all people, even those most at risk for heart disease.

The 2010 dietary guidelines had recommended those at risk for heart disease limit sodium to 1,500 milligrams. The new report said lowering to that amount can still be helpful for some. But the new advice follows a 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine that said there is no good evidence that eating less than 2,300 milligrams a day of sodium offers benefits.

With the average American eating more than 3,400 milligrams daily, the panel recommends at least trying to reduce sodium intake by 1,000 milligrams a day if the goals are unattainable.

Alice Lichtenstein, a member of the panel and a professor at Tufts University, said the new recommendation 'puts the focus where it should be.' Get sodium intake down, and fine-tune the numbers as more evidence comes in. 

EAT A PLANT-BASED DIET

The panel recommends eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. A plant-based diet is 'more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact' than the current U.S. diet, which is high in meat.

The report stops short of telling people not to eat meat, saying 'no food groups need to be eliminated completely to improve sustainability outcomes.'

Overall, the panel advises a diet lower in red and processed meat, and in a footnote says lean meats can be part of a healthy diet. The North American Meat Institute criticized the report, saying the health benefits of lean meat should be 'a headline, not a footnote.'

The meat recommendations in particular may prompt pushback from Capitol Hill. Last year, Congress noted the panel's interest in the environment and directed Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack 'to only include nutrition and dietary information, not extraneous factors' in final guidelines.
