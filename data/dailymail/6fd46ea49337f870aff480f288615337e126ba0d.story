If changing channels on a TV isn't exciting enough with a traditional remote, a company has created a control that is an exact replica of Doctor Who's sonic screwdriver.

Designed by The Wand Company, users can program the screwdriver using specific movements to turn electric appliances on and off, switch TV channels, and control volume.

It was created using 3D scans of the original gadget used in the show by former Doctor David Tennant.

London-based The Wand Company has created a remote control that is an exact replica of the tenth Doctor Who's sonic screwdriver, pictured. Users can program the screwdriver using specific movements to turn electric appliances on and off, switch TV channels, and control volume

The sonic screwdriver was first introduced in 1968, and was used 
regularly by the second Doctor, Patrick Troughton.

It
was written out of the series in 1982, but featured briefly in the 1996 Doctor 
Who TV Movie before making a full return in 2005.

It is a multifunctional tool used by the Doctor, although its most common function is picking locks. It can also scan people, aliens and other objects.

Throughout the series there have been different versions of the sonic screwdriver, depending on which Doctor was using it.

In the BBC TV series, Doctor Who uses the gadget to pick locks, perform 
medical scans, remotely control other devices and more.

The Wand Company wanted to build an exact likeness of the tool but the BBC told it they no longer had any in storage.

The company then contacted Tennant who agreed to lend them his sonic screwdriver, kept as a souvenir from his time on the show.

It can be programmed to control any infrared appliance and has a built-in motion sensor to detect individual movements.

Each battery-operated remote comes with a set of default movements but these can also be personalised.

For example, users could flick the screwdriver up to increase volume, or anti-clockwise to turn a device off.

The sonic screwdriver was first introduced in 1968. The remote control design, based on the tenth Doctor David Tennant's screwdriver, will be available from October and costs £69.95. Fans can also buy the screwdriver used by eleventh doctor, Matt Smith, for £59.99, pictured

The Wand Company co-founder Richard Blakesley, 38, said: 'We phoned David's agent the next day he came back and said 'That's fine, David says you can borrow it'.

'This is entirely down to David Tennant. We'd heard he was a nice guy, but there's nice and then there's bending over backwards to help somebody you've never heard of.'

The Wand Company took hundreds of photographs and 3D image scans of the device before returning it to the actor.

Blakesley and business partner Christopher Barnardo, 48, have previously turned other famous gadgets into remote controls, including Harry Potter's wand.

In 2010 they turned down the offer of £200,000 from Duncan Bannatyne after demonstrating their Harry Potter wand on Dragon's Den.
