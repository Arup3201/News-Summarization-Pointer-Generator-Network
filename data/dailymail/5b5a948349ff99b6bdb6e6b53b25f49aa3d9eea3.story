Family and friends have paid tribute to a young man who became trapped between a railway platform and a train after a fight broke out at the station.

Ryan Harrison died when he became stuck between the platform edge and the train as it moved away.

It is understood that following a row with a group of men, Mr Harrison either fell or was pushed down the side of the platform next to a stationary train.

The 22-year-old is thought to have been with a male friend at the station when the pair became involved in a confrontation with a group of men.

It is believed Ryan either fell or was 
pushed down the side of the platform, next to a stationary train at 
Guildford railways station in Surrey.

A family friend said Mr Harrison, of 
Woking, Surrey, had moved with his father to Spain to start a business but 
came back in September last year.

Daloney Carlton, partner of Mr 
Harrison’s father Tony, said: ‘He came back in September because he 
missed his friends and moved in with his girlfriend.

‘I don’t know what happened but I think he was with his girlfriend at the station.

‘He was a lovely lad and his father is in pieces. He is flying back in a couple of days but can’t even talk at the moment.’

Ryan's devastated friends and loved ones have written tribute messages on Facebook, while his girlfriend Jaime-Leigh Egerton posted two poignant pictures of the pair together - including one of them sharing a tender kiss.

The dark-haired 20-year-old states on her Facebook profile that she works in high street retailer New Look and bar chain Yates.

Friends posted tributes on social networking sites as news of the tragedy spread.

Ryan's pal Adam Wicks wrote on Facebook: 'Words cant even explain what you ment to me Ryan Harrison i'll miss you so much, truly lost a brother. nothing will even be the same now. love you and sleep tight xxxx'.

One note, signed by 'Charlie', said: "Ryan, I can't get my head around that you've gone.

'I keep thinking you'll call any minute and come out with something stupid like you usually do!

'You have been an amazing best friend to me and I will miss you dearly.

'We are all trying to stick together and help one another through.

'I promise to look after your little 'flee' [sic] Jaime Leigh. You were a brother to me.

'I've had to say goodbye to you so many times when you've gone to Zante, Spain etc.

'But what did we say instead to stop me crying? "This isn't goodbye, it's I'll see you soon."

'So for now, my darling, sleep tight and I will see you soon.

'Love you forever and always, your little Charlie xxxxxxx'.

A British Transport Police spokesman 
said three people have been arrested in connection with the incident 
which happened late on Saturday night.

The spokesman confirmed all three of those arrested in connection with the incident were male.

Two of the men, both aged 19 years 
and from the Guildford area, were arrested at the scene, while another 
man later handed himself in at a police station in Guildford.

The station was closed for most of the night following the incident, only re-opening fully at around 9am yesterday/on Sunday.

Making an appeal for witnesses to 
come forward, Detective Chief Inspector Iain Miller, senior 
investigating officer, said: 'The station was cordoned off until the 
early hours of Sunday morning while forensic officers conducted a 
thorough search and my team of detectives are working to establish the 
full circumstances surrounding the death, which we are currently 
treating as suspicious.'

He added: 'Clearly the man's family 
will have many questions about the circumstances leading up to his death
but at this time the full sequence of events is unclear.

'However, we will do everything we can to shed light on what took place on Saturday night.

'We'll be making local inquiries, 
including checking whether the incident was captured by CCTV cameras, 
but we know that there were a number of other people at the station at 
the time and want to hear from them.'

Liz Spiers, spokesman for South East 
Coast Ambulance Service, said: 'We were called at about 11.45pm on 
Saturday to Guildford railway station to a report of a man on the line.

'We sent an ambulance, a single responder, an officer and our Hazardous Area Response Team (HART).

'Unfortunately the man was pronounced dead at the scene.'
