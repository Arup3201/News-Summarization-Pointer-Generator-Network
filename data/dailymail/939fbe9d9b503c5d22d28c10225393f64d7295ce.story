The pastor of a Florida megachurch with a congregation in excess of 20,000 has resigned over a 'moral failing.'

Church elders announced to an estimated 7,500 parishioners attending a special Sunday meeting of the Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale that Pastor Bob Coy, 58, had resigned.

In a statement released Sunday, church elders said Coy, of Coral Springs, resigned Thursday as senior pastor of the 20,000-member Calvary Church 'after confessing to a moral failing in his life which disqualifies him from continuing his leadership role.'

Shocked: Congregants were taken aback at the announcement that Bob Coy stood down

'Most people were shocked,' congregant Robert Milne told the Sun-Sentinel. 'A lot of people were hurt, a lot of people are disappointed.'

Outreach Magazine listed Calvary Chapel as the 14th-largest church in America and one of the fastest-growing last year.

The church has assets valued at $135 million, according to the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability.  

Blogger Michael Newnham wrote 'We have confirmed that Coy has admitted to at least two affairs in the past year alone and has had a long standing “problem with pornography,' though the church has not elaborated on what Coy's moral failings were. 

Coy founded Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale in 1985 with his wife Diane. The couple have two children.

Coy's
 social media accounts make no mention of the revelations, although 
interestingly, the only person he follows on Facebook is a buxom Zumba 
instructor named Gigi.

'Who Jesus is ought to determine what we do. Our actions and Christ's example ought to harmonize. If they don't, then we're no longer following Jesus in the truest practical sense. We are disciples in word - but not in deed,' he posted on Facebook just days ago.

'Pastor Bob will be focusing his full attention on his personal relationship with God and with his family,' the church's statement reads.

'The governing board of the church is providing counselors and ministers who will help guide him through the process of full repentance, cleansing and restoration.'
