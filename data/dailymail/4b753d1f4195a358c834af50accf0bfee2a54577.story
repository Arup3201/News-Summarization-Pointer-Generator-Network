Supporters were outraged when Man United star Rio Ferdinand was left bleeding after being hit in the face with a two pence coin as he celebrated his team's derby victory at the weekend.

But it seems not everybody was as sympathetic to his plight, with relatives of fellow Premiership star Ashley Cole apparently taking to Facebook to gloat about the attack on Ferdinand.

Cole's brother Matthew is reported to have said in a post that seeing the defender hit in the eye had 'made his day'.

'Straight in the eye!!': Ashley Cole's brother Matthew is said to have described his glee at the attack on Ferdinand in a Facebook post

When Ferdinand was hit in the face with the coin as he celebrated his team beating Manchester City on Sunday, the Chelsea star's brother Matthew is said to have posted on Facebook: 'So happy Rio got hit in the face today when he tried to give it kissing his badge!! Straight in the eye!! Made my day.'

According to a report in the Daily Mirror, Cole's mother Sue later added her own comment: 'Give the fan that threw it a medal!!'

Cole and Ferdinand have been 
at odds since last year when Chelsea captain John Terry was accused of 
racially abusing Rio's brother Anton - also a player - during a match. 
Cole backed his Chelsea team-mate.

Rio was later fined by the FA for posting a message on Twitter which referred to Cole as a 'choc ice'.

The Facebook thread was later removed.

Sue Cole denied writing anything online about Ferdinand's injury.

Matthew Cole was unavailable for comment.

Ferdinand was left bleeding from his left eye following the incident which took place in the aftermath of United's injury-time winning goal in their 3-2 victory at the Etihad Stadium.

In extraordinary scenes, a City fan then ran on to the pitch to confront Ferdinand but was restrained by Manchester City's goalkeeper Joe Hart. A smoke flare was also thrown onto the pitch.

However, the Premier League star joked about it afterwards, tweeting: 'Whoever threw that coin,what a shot! Can't believe it was a copper 2p....could have at least been a Â£1 coin!'
