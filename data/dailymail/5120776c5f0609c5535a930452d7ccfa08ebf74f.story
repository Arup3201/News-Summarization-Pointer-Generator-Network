Sex assault suspect Freddie Starr has put his four-bedroom detached mansion up for sale for £900,000.

The luxuriously decorated home is set in a beautiful setting offering clear views of hills and fields in Warwickshire.

Complete with conservatory, games room and bar the home also boasts a detached log cabin in the garden.

Beautiful setting: The house is surrounded by trees and fields in a leafy part of Warwickshire

The home has been fully refurbished, with each bedroom decorated in its own unique style and colour scheme and ample space inside the house and on the terrace for small gatherings and parties, according to information supplied by his estate agents.

It his thought he shares the home with his children and fiancee Sophie Lea.

The move comes at a difficult juncture in the comedian’s life, after he was arrested by detectives earlier this month investigating Jimmy Savile’s decades of paedophilia.

He reportedly hit rock bottom after he was banned from being left alone with his own children by social services while the abuse claim against him is investigated.

Starr is accused of molesting a 
14-year-old in Savile's BBC dressing room forty years ago, which he 
denies and says the strain of the investigation is giving him heart 
problems.

'My life is ruined. I feel so desperate at times I want to go and end it all,' he told the Mirror, adding:

'It’s heartbreaking because I’m totally innocent. It makes me feel suicidal. I don’t think I can ever work again – how can I put a comedy face on after this?'

The former television star, 69, was bailed earlier this month and has not been charged with any offence.

The comedian was named by Karin Ward who claims she was groped by him at a Savile sex party 40 years ago after appearing on television alongside him.

Luxuriously refurbished: The home is decked out with a bar and lounge area overlooking the lush garden

Spacious: The home offers a comfortable living area - with room for large group to watch television together

Decadent: Drapes are hung over the large guest bed and a chandelier takes centre place

Every comfort: The mansion boasts four bedrooms, each uniquely decorated with their own colour schemes

Starr had denied meeting his accuser but a video later emerged of the pair of them together on Savile’s show ‘Clunk Click’ in 1974.

Warwickshire social services has now ordered him to only spend time with his children when his fiancee Sophie Lea, 34, is with them at their home.

A council will always act in this way when an individual is subject to sexual assault claims.

'I’m no sex pest,' he said, 'but right now I can only have supervised contact with my kids.

Regal colours: The bedrooms each have views of trees and nature and have ample storage space

Perfect for a little princess: The fourth bedroom is decorated in pink and white

Unique feature: To the back of the house is a log cabin with three rooms and attic space

Starr was taken into custody at a police station near his home earlier on November 1 as part of Operation Yewtree - Scotland Yard's inquiry into alleged child sexual exploitation by the late Jim'll Fix It presenter and others.

He voluntarily returned to speak to officers for further questioning the next day following his release on bail in the early hours of the morning.

Starr was then released for the second time on November 2 with officers saying he had been 're-bailed to a date in December'.

On
the same day officers raided his home, seizing his computer, hard 
drive, his old address books, old photographs and his iPhone, he says.

He denies claims by Karin Ward that he tried to grope her in 1974 when she was a 14-year-old schoolgirl.

Earlier this month, Freddie Starr cancelled a show to concentrate on defending the sex abuse allegations.

Fans were expecting to see the comedian perform his Back From The Jungle Tour at the Wyvern Theatre in Swindon, Wiltshire.

But Wyvern Theatre director Derek Aldridge said the show would not go on, following discussions with Starr and his team.

He said: 'Following the weekend, we have held further discussions with Freddie Starr and his management team and have agreed that the show will no longer take place at the Wyvern Theatre on Wednesday, November 7.’

Idyllic: The house is set amid trees and fields in Warwickshire

English country garden: The house back out on to fields and has a decked area for admiring the view

Spacious: The kitchen has enough space for three people to sit and eat - without getting in the way of the cook

Neutral tones: The master bedroom has an ensuite shower room decorated in granite tiles

Fully refurbished: The second bathroom is fitted with a free-standing bath and red carpet

Leafy terrace: The home has an outdoor area with heaters perfect for eating outside in the evening

Difficult time: Freddie Starr has spoken of his anger at being dragged into the Jimmy Savile scandal after he was arrested
