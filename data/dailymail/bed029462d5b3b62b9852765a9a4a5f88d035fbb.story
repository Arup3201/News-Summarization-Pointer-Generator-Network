An Al Qaeda supporter from Brooklyn is suing the US, claiming that tight-fitting shackles have given him deep-vein thrombosis.

Wesam El-Hanafi, 38, is due to be sentenced for helping terror network Al Qaeda. However, he is simultaneously suing the US, claiming that he's been mistreated since being detained and as a result has potentially life-threatening blood clots in one of his legs.

El-Hanafi, an Egyptian-American, claims that his symptoms started after his arrest in Dubai in 2010.

He claims that his legs were shackled for three days and four nights and that his FBI handlers didn’t allow him to stretch his legs properly during the 14-hour flight back to America.

His lawsuit claims that he was only allowed to walk around the plane once, for 15 minutes, so he could pray and use the bathroom.

Despite his condition being diagnosed in 2011, he is alleging that it went untreated for nearly two years through a lack of compassion from prison authorities.

The condition was exacerbated, he claims, when he was eventually given hospital treatment, but shackled so tightly that he was left in unbearable pain and needed another hospital stay two weeks later when he began coughing up blood.

‘He has trouble walking. He has constant pain,’ his lawyer Jake Harper told The New York Daily News.

El-Hanafi, a computer engineer and former Lehman Brothers employee with a wife and three children, faces up to 20 years in jail.

US authorities say that after meeting two Al Qaeda members in Yemen in 2008 he swore allegiance to their extremist organisation and taught them how to send undetected messages online.
