The Irish tourist who left his brother fighting for life in an alleged one-punch attack has pleaded for a lesser charge in a bid to head home soon with his family.

Barry Lyttle, 33, is facing reckless grievous bodily harm charges after he allegedly struck his brother Patrick, 31, during a late-night argument in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner-city on January 3.

Patrick was taken to hospital in a critical condition and spent six days in a coma in the intensive care unit at St Vincent's Hospital before being moved to a rehabilitation centre in Ryde.

After making a remarkable recovery, Patrick called for the charges laid against his brother to be dropped.

Speaking outside the court, Lyttle's lawyer Chris Watson said the family were hoping the Director of Public Prosecutions would agree to a lesser charge, which could be finalised in the local court.

'The best-case scenario is that whatever happens it doesn't impact on the family's ability to go home,' Mr Watson said.

Mr Watson said the family were waiting for the prosecution to consider a medical report of Patrick's condition before continuing negotiations.

'We are pressing to bring the matter to a close as quickly as we can,' he said outside of court.

'We're just waiting for the DPP to look at the evidence that shows that Patrick's recovered fully and there's no ongoing problems.'

The family has been in Australia for months, supporting the brothers. Lyttle told reporters he hoped 'it would come to a close very soon'.

Patrick said he had recovered well and didn't need ongoing treatment 'I'm just delighted with all the treatment that I've received,' he said.

He and his brother are supporting each other 'the whole way through', he added.

The brothers' father, Oliver, has been a constant presence besides his son at court from the beginning

Barry appeared in the Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday and successfully applied to have his bail reporting reduced. 

He will now only have to report to Blacktown police station on Fridays, instead of three times each week as initially ordered.

Magistrate Christopher O'Brien told the court he had no doubt Lyttle would attend court.

'The defendant has appeared on each occasion ... even in circumstances where his attendance has been excused,' he said. 

Lyttle is next due in court on April 9.
