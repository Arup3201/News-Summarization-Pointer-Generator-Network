John Terry has praised Chelsea team-mate Gary Cahill for his 'immense' match-defining block to deny Josip Drmic in England 2-0 win over Switzerland.

The former England captain, working as a pundit on Sky Sports, identified Cahill's 70th-minute intervention, with England leading 1-0 at the time, as the crucial moment in a morale-boosting win for Roy Hodgson's men.

Terry, who won 78 caps for England before retiring in 2012, said: 'At 1-0, he's got himself back in there. That recovery speed is something people tend to overlook.

Warm welcome: Terry said he'd had a 'great night' after posting this image to his official Instagram account

'I think Harty [Joe Hart] does well here initially, he delays him [Drmic], pushes him wide and Gaz comes back with a great block there.

'It's very important and an immense challenge. Over five yards, he's very quick. He does that for Chelsea an awful lot as well.'

England got their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign off to the perfect start and lifted the post-World Cup gloom as Danny Welbeck's double secured victory in Basel.

And Terry was full of praise for the front three of Welbeck, captain Wayne Rooney and Raheem Sterling, who caused endless problems for the Swiss defence.

He said: 'They've done very well. The manager and the team will be delighted with this performance.

'The pace up front from Sterling, Welbeck and Wazza [Rooney] stretched the opponents and that definitely benefited us.'

On Sterling's contribution, Welbeck added: 'He's been brilliant all night, he's been the difference. Every time he got the ball, he wanted to do something.

'He's very versatile, he can play behind, on the left or on the right. He can open up defences.'

Before the match, Terry had expressed his support for Rooney's recent appointment as captain following Steven Gerrard's retirement from international football following the World Cup.

He said: 'He's still one of the best players in the world and the right choice for the captain.

'He's a leader in the dressing room and the training field, he sets an example on daily basis. I've been on a the receiving end of a few of the shouts from him.

'When you're not performing well in training, he's the first one to let you know.'
