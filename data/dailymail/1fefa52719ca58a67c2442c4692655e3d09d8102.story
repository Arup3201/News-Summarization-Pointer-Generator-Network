Stabbing victim Ann Maguire had been due to retire next year after inspiring generations of pupils at her school over four decades.

She taught whole families from the local estate – first the parents, as well as their cousins, then their children and their children’s children.

Known for her dedication and kindness, the Spanish and religious studies teacher was remembered last night in the fondest of terms by her devastated friends and pupils.

Loved: Pupils described Ann Maguire, 61, as the heart of Corpus Christi College, where she taught generations

Tributes: One student left a note saying she was 'the best, most caring teacher and went the extra mile for everyone' (left). Another pupil thanked the Spanish and RE teacher for making life fair for them (right)

They said Mrs Maguire, 61, was the matriarch of Corpus Christi, striving for excellence and coaching even the most difficult children with care and patience.

Such was her devout nature, said one distraught pupil, she would have forgiven her attacker. Another said: ‘She was the best teacher ever, everyone loved her.’

Mrs Maguire began teaching at the Roman Catholic college in her early twenties, shortly before she married.

Her husband Donald, 62, is a part-time maths teacher and landscape gardener.

She lived with him in a £300,000 semi-detached home in Leeds and they have two daughters: Kerry, 32, a ballerina who retrained as an osteopath for pregnant women and babies, and Emma Jane, an acclaimed dancer with the Royal Ballet.

The younger sister, who celebrated her 30th birthday on Saturday, is a soloist with the company and has starred in productions including The Nutcracker, Mayerling, and The Sleeping Beauty.

She trained at the Royal Ballet School from the age of 11 –  after apparently inheriting a passion for the arts from her mother, a talented musician.

While Mrs Maguire was said to have been extremely proud of her daughters’ achievements, she was known locally for treating the pupils at her school as if they were her own.

As her family consoled each other over their loss, students gathered at the school to lay flowers in the teacher’s memory.

Some had travelled across the country to pay their respects. Many were in tears.

They
 spoke of Mrs Maguire being the ‘mother’ of the Catholic school, where 
she also worked as a head of year and helped pupils with applications 
for further education, apprenticeships and jobs.

Students
 said Mrs Maguire, who celebrated her birthday earlier this month, had 
begun working part time in preparation for retirement in a year’s time.

Jacob
 Hill, 16, from Leeds, said yesterday: ‘She would never hurt anyone. She
 was always trying to help people. She would never stop when she got a 
poor grade, she would always try and make it higher.’

Kara
 Green, 16, added: ‘She was the best teacher ever, everyone loved her. 
She stood up for you and really cared about us all. No one had a bad 
word to say about her. If she’d survived she would have forgiven him.’

As long as we were happy, she was happy. She would do anything 
for you

Channel
 4 television presenter Brendan Sheerin, who was taught by Mrs Maguire, 
wrote on Twitter: ‘Very sad to hear about Anne [sic] Maguire she was a 
lovely, special teacher who taught me and my brothers at our school 
Corpus Christi. RIP.’

Aine Arnold, 17, said the tragedy was ‘more like losing a family member than losing a teacher’.

She
 said: ‘As long as we were happy, she was happy. She would do anything 
for you. She helped me personally a lot. She’s going to be such a loss 
to the school. Hers were one of those lessons you didn’t want to miss.

‘She was just lovely. She was wonderful. I am devastated.’

Dean Quigley said the teacher celebrated her 40th year at the school last year.

‘She was just a wonderful, caring person,’ he said.

‘She
 was head of year 11 for in excess of ten years and she was just so 
patient in her pastoral work. She was held in such immense esteem. She 
taught the grandparents of some of these children here today.’

Samuel
 Dasaolu, 18, who is studying accounting and finance at De Montfort 
University in Leicester, was a pupil at Corpus Christi until 2011.

He
 said Mrs Maguire had a unique ability to calm disruptive pupils. ‘She 
was almost a mother figure of the school. I felt I could go and talk to 
her. She made everybody feel so comfortable,’ he said.

‘She never jumped to conclusions. I 
remember there was a disagreement between a student and another student.
 Usually most teachers would pick a side or say, “You’re both in 
detention”.

'But she listened to them and 
discussed the situation. She was a teacher that was loved by everybody. 
You didn’t have to be a good student to love her.’

Former pupil Nathan Mulenga, 18, described Mrs Maguire as ‘the best teacher in the world’.

‘Mrs Maguire taught me Spanish for five years while I was at the school and she was such a great teacher,’ he said.

‘She
 also taught religious education and she was my head of year while I was
 at the school. When I left in 2012 she always said she would help me 
and my friends in the future if ever we needed anything.

‘I went to college after leaving the school and she was the one who gave me a reference.

‘She cared about everyone even after they left school. It’s absolutely devastating to hear that she’s gone.’

Kerianne
 Ayward, 17, who left the school two years ago, said: ‘She has been my 
referee for everything. There’s no one else you would go to who’s 
better. She was the heart of the school.’

You taught four generations of our family
 and you were simply a totally fantastic teacher, always caring and 
always there to make us smile

Another former pupil, Peter Masefield, 18, said: ‘I just can’t understand why her. Of all people. She was the school’s figurehead.’

Many students paid tribute to Mrs Maguire on social media sites, expressing their utter shock that such a kind and gentle woman had been killed at school. They said it was particularly heartbreaking that she had been targeted because she was the one teacher who ‘never wrote anybody off’.

More than a hundred bunches of flowers had been left at the school gates in her memory last night. Students pinned photographs to the railings, along with teddy bears and other memorabilia.

One note said: ‘You inspired countless generations. You taught four generations of our family and you were simply a totally fantastic teacher, always caring and always there to make us smile (even if you were speaking Spanish).’

Danny Powell, 17, said: ‘She was the most caring teacher at the school, she wanted the best for everyone and understood anything you had to say to her. I can’t believe what has happened.’

Michael Walpole wrote: ‘RIP Mrs Maguire. Amazing teacher, amazing family friend. You will be sorely missed.’

Abby Warwick tweeted: ‘Never known a teacher as dedicated to every one of her students as Mrs Maguire, she honestly cared so much.’

Lucy Melia said: ‘Everybody has got nothing but pure love for Mrs Maguire. Still haven’t met anyone else like her. She was the heart of that school.’

Charlene Rue added: ‘Cannot get over this. She didn’t deserve this at all. One of the nicest teachers, who would have done anything for students. RIP Mrs Maguire.’

Natalie Jade Jones, 24, who was taught by Mrs Maguire for five years before leaving the college in 2006,  said: ‘I am honoured to have been taught by her, it is a huge loss.

‘She was a wonderful woman and a fantastic teacher who will be sadly missed by everyone who knew her. Myself and all her other former pupils are in utter shock and truly devastated.’
