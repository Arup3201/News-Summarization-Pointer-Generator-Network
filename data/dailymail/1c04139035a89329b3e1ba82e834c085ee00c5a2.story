A 19-year-old model who posed nude and filmed graphic footage at her old Catholic high school has been sentenced to 45 days in jail.

Valerie Dodds, known as Val Midwest online, said she was just going to treat the time at Lancaster County Jail, Nebraska as 'a really bad vacation'.

'I feel like I'm harmless as to what I 
did, and they are definitely bringing the hammer as far as the 
sentencing goes,' she told KETV before she reported to jail on Wednesday.

She also sent out a tweet, saying: 'Jail bait baby'.

Controversy: Valerie Dodds, 19, was charged with indecent exposure for taking nude pictures and footage at her old Catholic high school after classmates ridiculed her for wanting to model nude

Last June, Dodds was charged with indecent exposure after posing nude on the football field and inside Pius X High School and masturbating on campus.

She said it was a way to get back at her former classmates and teachers who scorned her dream of working in the adult entertainment industry.

She had attended the school before transferring to another school for her senior year.

'Everyone in my high school had something nasty to say to me when I started my website and so this is my tribute to all of you,' she wrote on her website, where she shared the racy footage and images.

But days after baring it all, she received a ticket for trespassing and public nudity.

'Why would you give me a ticket for public nudity if I'm trespassing onto private property?' she asked.

Dodd's website manager, Shane Harrington,
 added: 'It may be wrong, and some people may not agree, but I always 
believe if you're attacked, you defend yourself.'

After Dodds received a ticket, St Pius X school said in a statement that they would pursue the case if she had done anything illegal.

'We constantly follow our school's motto: 
To Restore All Things In Christ,' the statement said.

'To that end, we are praying for the 
young lady and her family, and we stand ready to offer forgiveness and 
support should she seek it.'

But Dodds added on her website: 'The school has already had an all school 
prayer for me and I am getting bombarded with crazy emails from 
teachers, priests and friends.

'But f*** em I am going to keep getting
 naked. I think I was born to do this, I have never had so much fun in 
my life and it's just starting out. I can't wait to see what it's like 
in a couple years from now.'

Dodds' lawyer said her sentencing is the longest sentence he's heard of for indecent exposure. A district court judge will hear her appeals case next.
