Both the host and one of the promoters for a Michigan party that saw 2,000 attendees on Saturday say a similar event will take place.

Host James Taylor, 21, spoke to Fox 17 and said his 'Project P' event in Hilton Township was actually the second.

Seven guests had to be hospitalized, an alleged sexual assault took place at the party, and a drunk party guest later drove into a  house, the affiliate station reported.

The 
organizers, the alleged rapist, those who allegedly overdosed along with
 Taylor and the homeowner may be charged, Sheriff Purcell told Fox 17.

A Friday event is being organized by group 'Turn down for whattttttt?' on Facebook, the affiliate station reported.

Host: James Taylor denied responsibility for his guests at the enormous 'Project P' party on Saturday

While Taylor spoke to a camera crew, this guest was filmed passed out on the floor of his house

Crowd: A reported 2,000 guests showed up at Taylor's party in Hinton Township on Saturday

Dangerous: Seven people were hospitalized and an alleged rape took place at the bash. A drunk driver later reportedly left the party and crashed into a house

WOOD reported the 19-year-old female attendee at the party was allegedly gang-raped.

Speaking to Fox 17 on Monday, Taylor said of first responders' arrival 'I'm glad they went. People could have been laying dead this morning. I'm glad the police were here. And the ambulances.'

'I didn't force anything down anybody's throat. I didn't make anybody stay here till 7am or 11 or whatever it is when everybody finally left. I didn't make this kid pass out on my floor,' he said, gesturing to a party guest while speaking to a camera crew. 'People wanted to be here. That was their decision.'

Third round: A Friday party is reportedly being arranged

Promoter: Brittany Johnson says the next party will be 'hopefully maybe bigger'

One of the party promoters, Brittany Johnson, told Fox 17 on Monday 'We're proud we hosted it. We're proud to be a part of it. We're glad it happened. It definitely is something that we're always going to remember.'

Speaking about the first party, she said it 'it kind of set up all on Facebook. It was a big birthday party for a 16-year-old. They were like, well we are going to make this second one ten times bigger and we were just like yeah, we are down to help, and we made the Twitter page and it just escalated from there.'

Like Taylor, Johnson denied responsibility.

'Stupid mistakes with obviously drug overdoses and the rape, which I mean we definitely, we didn’t have any control over that. I mean people came at their own risk,' she told Fox 17.

Johnson told the Fox 17 reporter the next event will be 'hopefully maybe bigger.'

A Twitter account for 'Project P!' - whose handle is @P*****Palooza - says it is making a video about the party's exploits.
