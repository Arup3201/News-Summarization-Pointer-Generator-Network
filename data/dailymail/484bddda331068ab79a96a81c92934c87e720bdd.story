Goldman Sachs has analyzed the spending habits of Millennials and are reaching out to spread the news using the hippest technology it can find, emoji.

The multinational released macroeconomic insights into the way that people born in the 1980s and 1990s are buying houses, getting married and using phone apps

However, the firm, which had more than $34.5billion in revenue last year, took the time to condense its findings from Millenials: Coming of Age into a series of 22 cartoon characters on Twitter.

Goldman Sachs, which had more than $34.5billion in revenue last year, condensed the life of many Millennials into a string of emojis

Goldman's insights put numbers to well-known trends about Millenials such as the fact that they are holding off on large purchases such as houses, are waiting to get married and buying more products online.

The emoji version of a twenty- or thirty-something's life begins with a fresh-faced young boy cartoon added to a stack of books representing his education.

When added together this leads to graduation, but a cancel sign next to a tie, presumably referencing graduates' increased difficulties in finding full-time employment in their fields after their studies. 

Instead, Millennials are met with curved arrow emoji that leads them back to their parents' houses.

A series of six clocks the represent how the generation is taking longer than its forerunners to reach milestones such as getting a stable career, getting married, having kids and buying a home, the last six emoji.

The tweet also used the hashtags #millennial and #economy. 

Other insights include the fact that younger consumers are using 'sharing economy' apps to access cars and music without buying them, according to the Goldman report.

The investment banking firm released a report compiling information about the spending and lifestyle habits of those born in the 1980s and 90s

Goldman Sachs's report provided figures for the life choices of Millennials, such as waiting longer to get married and live on their own

Only 15 per cent of respondents to a survey said that they thought owning a car was 'extremely important'. 

Ninety-three per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds plan on owning a home someday, though the younger generation has also seen an increased number of renters. 

The firm found that the mean marriage age is now 30, rather than 23 for those getting married in the 1970s.

A growing number of young people also define healthy living as not smoking or drinking too much, as opposed to just not falling sick.

Eighty-three per cent of 12-graders in the study said they disapproved of adults smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, up 13 per cent from 1998.

Some of the concepts  too difficult to show in tiny picture form on Twitter.

While some may laugh at Goldman's use of emoji as a cute way to gain traction on Twitter, the tiny cartoons have gained an increased seriousness.

In January Brooklyn teenager Osiris Aristy was arrested after he posted alleged terrorist threat messages that included a gun emoji pointed towards a police emoji.

Aristy's charges were later dropped, though courts and others in official capacities still struggle with how to interpret or use the cartoons, according to Wired. 

Millenials are forgoing purchases of items such as cars and getting access to expensive goods through apps, according to the Goldman Sachs report
