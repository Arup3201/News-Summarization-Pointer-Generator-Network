A company has come up with a range of food perfect for busy fashioniastas at London Fashion Week, providing all the goodness of 'five-a-day' fruits and vegetables without the need to prep, cook, or even sit down to eat.

They claim that just three canapes and one fruit cocktail from the range will provide enough nutrients for the whole day because they are full of vitamins and antioxidants.

The powerful party snacks were created by staff at high-end appliance brand Miele, in a bid to combat 'fashion week fatigue' around the tents of Somerset House next week.

Vitamin-packed canapes and cocktails at London Fashion Week will provide fashionistas with their five-a-day

All of the canapes and cocktails are full of antioxidants which hydrate as well as boosting metabolism

The tasty canapes were all handmade and cooked using the new state-of-the-art Miele Steam Oven.

Refreshing cocktails include raspberry and grapefruit, spicy carrot and orange, and pineapple and papaya.

All of the healthy treats are full of antioxidants which hydrate and boost metabolism.

They have been cooked in a healthy way to keep calories down, yet still maintaining the key nutrients from the fruit and vegetables.

Miele teamed up with fashion company Antipodium to create the menu, which will be available to sample during their presentation on September 13.

One of the canapes is the sweet Potato Rosti, Green Pea Humus and Quails Egg - a classic flavour combination full of fibre and a fantastic source of energy

The party bites and drinks were created by staff at high-end appliance brand Miele, who are on a mission to combat fatigue at this year's London Fashion Week

The Asian Style Beef Carpaccio  is full of vitamins and antioxidants from ingredients like ginger, mango and chilli

A spokesman for Miele, said: 'We want to encourage people to live a healthy lifestyle, using different ideas and techniques; our team of home economists helped to do this.

'Miele has always championed living in a healthy way and being creative in the kitchen so this was the perfect project to bring both our passions to life and we are glad to be able to put our stamp on this.'

Daniel Mcilwraith, Head Designer at Antipodium, said: 'We are excited to partner with Miele this season by helping to ease people into the week with a selection of morning canapes and cocktails.

'To prevent you turning fashion weak, we have collaborated on a healthy and delicious menu, offering an indulgent break in your schedule.'
