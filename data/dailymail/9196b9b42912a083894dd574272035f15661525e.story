Moscow sold £6billion gold and foreign currency to protect the rouble

Wholesale gas prices rose the most in two years yesterday as markets reacted to the crisis in Ukraine.

Fears that supplies to western Europe could be affected saw the price surge by 10 per cent at one point.

The cost of crude oil also rose – driven by fears that Russia, which is a major producer, might be hit by trade sanctions.

The turmoil spilled over into stockmarkets, with big falls in share prices in London and New York.

This morning a Kremlin aide said that if the United States were to impose sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, Moscow might be forced to drop the dollar as a reserve currency and refuse to pay off loans to U.S. banks.

Sergei Glazyev, an adviser to the Kremlin who is often used by the authorities to stake out a hardline stance but does not make policy, added that if Washington froze the accounts of Russian businesses and individuals, Moscow would recommend that all holders of U.S. treasuries sell them.

The statement comes as the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee admitted it is preparing legislation to provide support to Ukraine, and consulting the Obama administration on possible sanctions against individual Russians - ranging from visa bans and asset freezes to suspending military cooperation and sales, as well as economic sanctions.

Moscow has been forced to sell off gold and foreign currency worth £6billion to try to protect the sliding value of the rouble.

The
 threat from Kremlin Aide Sergei Glazyev that Russia could sell all its 
US Treasuries, drop the dollar as a reserve currency and default on 
loans from the US is an idle one according to analyst Mark Oswald at 
Monument Securites.

‘It would be a declaration of economic war - and it would hurt Russia a lot more than the US.

'Russia’s
 main exports are oil and gas, which are traded in dollars and which 
means Russia receives constant huge inflows of dollars.

‘Russia
 would have to find A buyer for what is probably in the region of 
$100billion in US Treasuries, which, if not impossible, would in any 
case mean they would get a terrible deal. By defaulting on loans their 
access to funding globally would be cut off.

‘In
 the unlikely hypothetical event the threat was carried through, the 
main impact would be upward pressure on long-term US interest rates – 
but it is likely that the Federal Reserve could take steps to counter 
that. There would be passing disruption for the US and world markets but
 lasting damage to Russia itself.’

Russia’s central bank raised its key interest rate from 5.5 per cent to 7 per cent to try to stop investors taking their money out of the country.

The £34billion tumble in the value of shares on the biggest Russian stock exchange, the MICEX, was greater than the cost of hosting and running the Winter Olympics last month.

Andrei Klepach, Russia’s deputy 
economy minister, described the reaction of the financial markets as 
‘hysteria’, which would subside in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Moscow seemed to be initiating economic sanctions against the Ukraine, with Russia's top gas producer Gazprom announcing it will remove a discount on gas prices for Ukraine from April

Motorists were warned of potential fuel price rises as speculators bought up stocks to capitalise on the political uncertainty.

An RAC spokesman said: ‘Fuel traders 
have already begun to buy up stocks to guard against being caught out in
 the event of the situation worsening, which automatically causes prices
 to increase due to a tightening in supply. 

‘And,
 to make matters worse, the price of oil will almost certainly be 
negatively affected, further increasing fuel costs and, in turn, 
forecourt prices.’

Luke 
Bosdet, a spokesman for the AA, said: ‘Experience from previous crises 
shows that commodity market speculation tends to be a greater problem 
than the actual threat to supply. Over recent weeks, reduced oil flow 
from Libya has put upward pressure on the price of oil yet it has had 
little impact on the UK pump price. This is primarily due to the 
strength of the pound.

‘The average price of petrol is 10p a litre lower than a year ago, when it peaked at 140p a litre. Now it is still below 130p. The $2-a-barrel rise in today’s Brent oil price represents a possible 1p rise in the pump price of petrol, but only if sustained.’

Gas from Russia, some of which is exported through pipelines that run across Ukraine, makes up around 25 per cent of supplies to the Continent’s homes and businesses.

Masked and wielding makeshift weapons, a crowd of around 3,000 pro-Russian activists led a demonstration in the Ukrainian port of Odessa yesterday.Members of the group managed to break into a session of the local parliament, smashing windows and injuring an official, according to local reports.Congregating outside the building, activists in balaclavas and helmets, waved Russian flags and wooden clubs with screws in and chanted ‘referendum’.Police had to move in to after dozens of young people from the far-right Pravy Sektor arrived on the scene demanding that the pro-Russian demonstrators leave and remove a Russian flag that had been placed on the building.In the eastern city of Donetsk, around 100 pro-Russian protesters seized two floors of a regional government building after the self-imposed Kiev government appointed a local oligarch as  a regional governor.

It is feared that Moscow will use its control over the supply as economic leverage to head off opposition to its decision to send troops in to Crimea. It supplies gas to Ukraine at a deep discount – a concession it warns will end in April.

This could affect supplies to other countries if Ukraine decides to grab gas from the Russian pipelines crossing its territory.

It used this tactic during a dispute in 2009 and prices rose sharply. Russia does not supply gas directly to the UK, however any increase in international wholesale prices will feed through to customers here.

Analysts point out that Western Europe is less reliant on Russian gas than before.

The unusually mild winter means that the UK has 25 per cent more in storage than normal.

At the same time, European nations have spent billions on wind power with the result that many gas-fired power stations have been mothballed.

And strong westerly winds have allowed UK windfarms to consistently produce more than 10 per cent of the country’s electricity in recent weeks.

The wholesale cost of gas had been falling for three weeks and – despite the Ukraine crisis – it is still below the level of February 2012.

Joe Conlan, an energy trader at Inenco, said: ‘Gas prices remain volatile and are closely linked to the power price – further price rises may be seen.

‘The situation could be worse but, with Europe having had a mild winter, prices have fallen significantly of late. However, this morning’s rise has eradicated three weeks of constant falls.

‘Should this continue, prices are likely to carry on rising in the medium term.’

UK gas prices rose as high as 61.95p a therm – up 9.4 per cent – at one stage before falling back to around 60p a therm.

The events in Russia will be watched with particular concern by the British energy giant BP. Last year it ended a troubled partnership with Russian oligarchs and decided to get into bed with the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft, where it owns 20 per cent of the shares.

Sanctions imposed against Russia could directly impact BP and its desire to be the partner of the Kremlin in exploiting oil and gas reserves in  Siberia and the Arctic.
