This little girl has the whole world in her sights as she greedily eyes up a miniature planet.

Vintage Confections began making the edible image lollipops back in Spring 2012, when they began receiving requests for different themed items into our lollipops for parties and events

'By using the finest details, we can allow for great clarity and images,' said Cheryl Carr, co-founder of Vintage Confections.

'Using these carefully crafted images, we are now able to develop endless concepts and in most cases create something that will fit any concept.

'We thought the solar system set would be an interesting take on this concept as it’s an original way of showing how the solar system is created.'

The stunning detail in the Venus (left) and Earth (right) makes the lollies almost a shame to eat

The solar system consists of the Sun and eight planets. Pluto was originally classified as the ninth planet from the Sun, before being recategorised as a dwarf planet in 2006. 

Vintage Confections began making the edible image lollipops back in Spring 2012, when they began receiving requests for different themed items into our lollipops for parties and events.

'Both children and adults love lollipops,' Cheryl, 35, said.

'And everyone is fascinated when they can see Earth of Saturn in such detail.

'It makes you almost not want to eat them!'

Vintage Confections have already sold more than 3500 sets of the lollies, which come as a set of six or ten planets.
