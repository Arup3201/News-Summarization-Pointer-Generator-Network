QPR face a major battle to hold on to Darnell Furlong after the wonderkid made his debut against Hull last weekend.

Furlong, son of former Chelsea and QPR striker Paul, is out of contract at the end of the season.

West Brom, Newcastle, Crystal Palace and Hull are among the teams monitoring Furlong's situation at Rangers as they battle against relegation.

New Rangers manager Chris Ramsey is under instruction to develop young players at Loftus Road and Furlong is among the most promising.

The situation is complicated because Paul is also the club's Under 18 coach and his son has been with Rangers since the age of 10.
