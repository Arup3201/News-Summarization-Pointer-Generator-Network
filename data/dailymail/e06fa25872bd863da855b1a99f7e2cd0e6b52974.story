Libyan rebels claim to have found a mass grave containing the bodies of 150 civilians slaughtered by forces loyal to Colonel Gadaffi.

A spokesman said rebel forces had found the buried bodies of civilians about 60 miles to the west of the city of Misrata.

He claimed in addition to the grave, troops had discovered video 'showing kidnappers cutting the throats of people'.

The spokesman said: 'We discovered a mass grave containing 150 bodies in Tawargha. These are the corpses of civilians kidnapped from Misrata by Gaddafi’s loyalists.'

Rebel troops are now believed to be working their way up the coastal road outside the town of Hisha about 100 km west of Misrata as they advance towards Tripoli.         

They took control of an oil refinery in the western town of Zawiyah and blocked the main highway north to the capital on Thursday, further isolating Muammar Gaddafi’s Tripoli stronghold.   

The advances in recent days have cut Gaddafi’s forces off from their main supply routes following a long stalemate, putting the Libyan leader’s 41-year rule under unprecedented pressure.

The Zawiyah refinery is one of the few sources of fuel for Gaddafi’s troops and the people of Tripoli.       

Small groups of rebel fighters 
occupied the inside of the Zawiyah refinery complex, about 30 miles west
 of Tripoli on the highway linking Tripoli to Tunisia, with no sign of 
the pro-Gaddafi forces that had battled for the plant for days.

A rebel commander said the pipeline linking it to Tripoli was severed on Tuesday.

Doctors
 at a hospital south of Zawiyah said nine people were killed and at 
least 45 injured in fighting around the town and at the refinery on 
Wednesday, most of them rebels.

They said pro-Gaddafi forces had hit a house near the hospital with Grad rockets.  

Rebels are also in control of the town of Garyan, about 80 km south of Tripoli on the main highway and have placed a T-34 tank and an anti-aircraft gun taken from Gaddafi forces in the main square.        

One of the fighters said: 'We took one tank and an anti-aircraft gun from Gaddafi’s forces. Next, we will go to Tripoli.'

A spokesman for Gaddafi played down recent rebel gains and said the government remained in control of the country.

He said: 'This is a crisis that will last a few days and then it will be, God willing, overcome.

'We will push ahead and until we liberate the whole country.'   

Fernando Calado of the International Organisation for Migration has expressed concerns at the news that the pipeline carrying oil to Tripoli from Zawiyah had been cut.

He said: 'that would imply dire consequences for the population in Tripoli in terms of fuel supplies needed for the city to keep operating.'

He said there had been a sharp 
increase in the past week in the number of foreign nationals asking to 
be evacuated and estimated that more than 300,000 foreigners remain in 
Tripoli, including many from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Chad, Egypt and
 Tunisia.

He added: 'We
 have received 2,000 requests at this point. The potential caseload is 
huge. We’re exploring the possibility of land, sea and air evacuations.'

Libya’s rebel National Transitional Council (NTC) denies holding secret talks with Gaddafi to end the war.

But suspicions persist that some form of end-game negotiation may be going on.   

The NTC insists Gaddafi should step down and leave Libya, saying talks ignoring this basic demand would be 'unthinkable'.

Aided by NATO bombers, assault helicopters and a naval blockade, the rebels have transformed the battle in the last few days after many weeks of stalemate.             

The United States also deployed two more Predator drones for surveillance operations over Libya, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.

It was unclear how many drones the U.S. already had over the country.               

In Brega, on the eastern front, rebel forces said they had suffered 18 killed and 33 wounded on Tuesday and Wednesday in their battle to dislodge Gaddafi forces from the oil port and refinery, where they have been fighting for many days.

The 69-year-old Gaddafi seems isolated with rebel forces closing in and vowing to enter Tripoli by the end of the month.
