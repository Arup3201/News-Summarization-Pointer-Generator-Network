Pastry chef and Cronut inventor Dominique Ansel has teamed up with Nutella to create a limited-edition dessert featuring the beloved hazelnut spread in celebration of International Pancake Tuesday on February 17. 

The Nutella Pancake Cone will be available for one day only during a special New York City event held at Grand Central Station's Vanderbilt Hall - where the mini-treats will be handed out for free. 

'There's something about Nutella that goes beyond just the flavors of hazelnut and cocoa, but has an emotion that brings me right back to my childhood,' Mr Ansel said in a statement.

'It is always a fun inspiration for new creations,' he added. 'I am thrilled to partner with Nutella again and put a creative spin on the traditional pancake for today’s International Pancake Tuesday celebration.'

The miniature pancake cones are filled with the hazelnut spread and topped with sea salt.

The unique dessert will be given out on a first come, first served basis between 11am and 4pm on Tuesday.

Two thousand Nutella Pancake Cone's will be made for the event, with the first 1,000 customers receiving two of the treats. 

Nutella fans can also enjoy a sampling station as well as a customized pancake bar filled with a variety of toppings, including bananas and strawberries.  

This isn't the first time Mr Ansel has joined forces with Ferrero, the manufacturer of Nutella.

In 2014, hundreds of people lined up at Madison Square Park for a tasting of Mr Ansel's Nutella Cronut holes, which he created for the 50th anniversary of the hazelnut spread. 

'Last year we celebrated our 50th anniversary and were humbled by the way our fans showed their passion and love for the Nutella brand,' said the Senior Brand Manager for Nutella at Ferrero USA, Inc.

'This year we looked for another way to celebrate with them, and since Nutella makes pancakes extra special, we found International Pancake Tuesday to be the perfect opportunity to do so.'
