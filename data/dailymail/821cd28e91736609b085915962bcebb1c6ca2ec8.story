Burglars have struck twice at Peaches Geldof’s home since her death last month, police revealed last night.

The house where Bob Geldof’s daughter lived with her husband, Thomas Cohen, and their two children has been targeted by thieves in recent weeks.

CCTV had been installed in the £1million home, in Wrotham, Kent, but the cameras were damaged by the trespassers.

A red ride-on lawnmower, which featured in one of their family photographs taken before Miss Geldof’s death, was stolen in the first incident in mid-April.

No items were stolen in the second attack, which happened on Friday.

Miss Geldof was found dead in her home on April 7.

Mr Cohen found her slumped in her bed after he had been unable to contact her the night before. It was revealed at the opening of the TV presenter and columnist’s inquest that recent heroin use ‘was likely to have played a role’ in her death.

A spokesman for Kent Police told the Mail last night: ‘Police are investigating a burglary at an address in Wrotham on May 9.

'Officers were at the address within five minutes and no personal items are believed to have been stolen.

‘Additionally, in mid-April a lawnmower was reported to have been taken from the grounds.’

A source told The Sun: ‘The people who did this are just vultures.’

There has been speculation Mr Cohen would sell the house because of its association with his late wife’s death.

The star’s death has tragic similarities to that of her mother, Paula Yates, who died from an accidental heroin overdose in 2000 at the age of 41.

After launching an investigation into Miss Geldof’s death, Kent Police said it was ‘unexplained with no third party’ involvement.

Earlier this month, police confirmed that drugs paraphernalia had been found in Miss Geldof’s home following her death, and added that Mr Cohen was not under suspicion of any involvement.
