Scientists claim the rise of untreatable bacteria is one of the biggest health threats facing the world.

To prevent minor infections killing people globally, researchers are in a race against time to develop new and better types of antibiotics.

Now scientists in Switzerland believe they have found one solution to the problem in an unlikely place: the gray shag mushroom that grows on horse dung.

Scientists in Switzerland believe they have found a substance that can lead to a new type of antibiotic in an unlikely place: the gray shag mushroom (pictured) 

The substance, known as copsin, has the same effect as traditional antibiotics, but belongs to a different type of biochemical family because it is a protein.

The researchers led by Markus Aebi, a mycology professor at ETH Zurich, discovered the substance in the common inky cap mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea.

Copsin belongs to the group of defensins, a class of small proteins produced by many organisms to combat microorganisms that cause disease.

The human body also produces defensins to protect itself against infections. They have been found, for example, on the skin and in the mucous membranes.

For Professor Aebi, the main focus of this research project was not primarily on applications for the new substance.

'Whether copsin will one day be used as an antibiotic in medicine remains to be seen. This is by no means certain, but it cannot be ruled out either,' he says.

The ETH professor is now looking at how fungi have used defensins and other naturally antibiotic substances for millions of years to protect themselves against bacteria - without becoming resistant. 

Scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics, marking the next step in the fight against drug-resistant superbugs

Scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics, marking the next step in the fight against drug-resistant superbugs.

A small test study has found the new drug is effective at targeting the bacteria that causes MRSA.

Researchers believe the likelihood of the bug developing a resistance to the new drug is 'very limited'.

A version of the drug is already used in specialist creams to treat conditions including acne, eczema, rosacea and skin irritations.

Dutch biotech firm Micreos claims Staphefekt is the first endolysin - a bacteria-killing enzyme - available for use on human skin.

While targeting MRSA and other strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, the drug's make up means it leaves 'good' bacteria unharmed - important in the case of long-term use.

The firm unveiled its discovery at the EuroSciCon meeting, Antibiotics Alternatives for the New Millenium, in London last week. 

'Fungi have internal instructions on how to use these substances without resulting in selection of resistant bacteria. How to decode these instructions is an intriguing problem for basic research,' explains Professor Aebi.

In addition to being used as an antibiotic in medicine, it may also be possible to use copsin in the food industry as well.

This is because copsin kills many pathogens including Listeria, a type of bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning and is therefore feared, especially in the production of non-heat treated foodstuffs such as raw milk cheeses and dried meats.
