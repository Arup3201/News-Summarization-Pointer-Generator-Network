Archaeologists have unearthed a 6,000-year-old temple in the Ukraine that shows evidence of of complex sacrificial practices. 

The prehistoric place of worship was found to contain altars and burnt lamb bones as well as human-like figurines, shedding light on practices within a huge prehistoric settlement.

Measuring 197ft by 66ft (60 metres by 20 metres) the temple was originally a two-storey construction made of wood and clay with a courtyard,

Archaeologists have discovered a 6,000-year-old temple in the Ukraine that shows signs of sacrifices. Measuring 197ft by 66ft (60 metres by 20 metres) the temple (pictured) was a two storey construction made of wood and clay with a galleries courtyard

Nataliya Burdo and Mykhailo Videiko told the European Association of Archaeologists' annual meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, that the upper floor of the building was divided into five rooms.

Archaeologists discovered the remains of eight clay platforms (pictured) that could have been used as altars, as well as ‘numerous burnt bones of lamb, associated with sacrifice’

The temple is at the heart of a vast prehistoric settlement near modern-day Nebelivka (marked with an A on the map), thought to cover an area of 288 acres (238 hectares) based on the results of a geophysical survey

The temple was discovered in 2009 near Nebelivka in the Ukraine.

It measures 197ft by 66ft (60 metres by 20 metres).

The two storey structure was made from wood and clay, with a courtyard.

It is divided into rooms that held clay 'altars' and had red walls.

Pottery fragments, humanlike figurines and gold hair ornaments were found.

The structure was at the heart of a prehistoric village covering 288 acres (238 hectares).

They discovered the remains of eight clay platforms that may have been used as altars, as well as ‘numerous burnt bones of lamb, associated with sacrifice’, according to the journal Tyragetia.

The researchers, of the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, said the floors and walls of the rooms could have been decorated with red paint – perhaps to create a sacrificial atmosphere.

There were seven ‘altars’ on the ground floor as well as a courtyard filled with animal bones and fragments of pottery.

Clay humanlike figurines were found, which have beak-like noses and eyes that look as if they are mismatched because they are different sizes.

Hair decorations made of gold and measuring less than an inch in size were unearthed too.

The settlement would have contained more than 1,200 buildings and 50 streets. 

The complex temple was built in the Ukraine at least 1,000 years before Stonehenge (pictured). Archaeologists believe the prehistoric monument in Wiltshire was built anywhere from 3000 BC to 2000 BC

Hair decorations made of gold and measuring less than an inch in size were unearthed at the temple, which was an important building in the prehistoric village. The settlement would have contained more than 1,200 buildings and 50 streets

The researchers, of the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, said the floors and walls of the rooms could have been decorated with red paint – perhaps to create a sacrificial atmosphere. Pottery fragments (pictured) were also found at the site

It is not known what the human figures (pictured) were used for at the temple, but similar figurines have been discovered at similar prehistoric sites in the Ukraine and eastern Europe

It was a similar size to others found in the Ukraine and in and other parts of Eastern Europe, which belonged to the ‘Trypillian’ culture.

The modern name is inspired by the village of Trypillia, where artefacts from the ancient culture, similar to the figures found at the site,  were first discovered.

Archaeologists believe that the settlement at Nebelivka was abandoned by ancient people, who burned the temple down. This is believed to have happened at several Trypillian sites.

Curiously, temples of a similar size and design were being built in the Middle East between the fifth to fourth millennia BC, the researchers said.

For example, a 6,000-year old temple at the ancient city of Eridu, in modern-day Iraq was also divided into small rooms.
