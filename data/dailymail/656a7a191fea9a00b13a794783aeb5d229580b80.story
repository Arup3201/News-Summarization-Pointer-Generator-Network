An endurance runner who was struck by lighting halfway through a mountain race not only kept going for another 12 hours but still managed to clinch third place.

Canadian runner Adam Campbell and his pace-setter Aaron Heidt were caught in the storm as they approached the highest point of the Hardrock 100 race in Silverton, Colorado.

Stuck on open ground atop the 14,000ft Handies Peak, they were left with no choice but to try to run through it. Then lightning struck 200 metres ahead of them.

Remembering the old adage about lightning never striking twice, they pushed on. It was the wrong decision. 'Right when we hit the summit, we heard a huge crack and a flash of light and both of us got knocked to the ground,' Mr Campbell told Michael Platt of the Calgary Sun.

'I heard the battery on my headlamp pop — and we were laying there looking at each other, and we both swore.

'It was really scary, with lightning going on all around us — you’re in shock, like "were we really just struck by lightning in the middle of a race?"

'That just doesn’t happen. Of all the things you prepare for, this isn’t one of them.'

The Hardrock 100 race through the back country of the San Juan Mountains is touted as one of America's most difficult trail-running races.

Runners compete around a 100.5-mile loop linking the mining towns of Silverton, Telluride, Ouray and Lake City, with an average elevation of 11,000ft and a high point of 14,000 ft.

Mr Campbell and Mr Heidt had just scaled that high point, some 60 miles into the race, when the storm struck.

Mr Campbell, an accomplished marathon runner who works as a lawyer in Calgary, Alberta, told, Brian Metzler, editor-in-chief of Competitor: 'There's nothing up there, no place to hide, no rocks, no trees, nothing.

'We didn't really have much of a choice. We wanted to get over the peak as soon as we could and get out of there.'

Having survived the lightning strike virtually unscathed, both men ran on through the night, and the rain, with Mr Campbell eventually coming in third, having covered the course in 25 hours, 56 minutes and 36 seconds.

As he reached the finish line he grabbed a bear, drinking part and pouring the rest over his head, before proclaiming: 'Wow, that was a hard race.'
