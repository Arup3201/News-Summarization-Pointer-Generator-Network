Serial thief Annette Daniel, 51, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after admitting stealing designer handbags and clothes

A notorious serial thief dubbed the 'Queen of Shoplifting' has been jailed for stealing more than £35,000 worth of luxury goods from Harrods.

Annette Daniel, 51, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after admitting stealing designer handbags and clothes from the world famous London store in May and November last year.

Sentencing Daniel, who has 22 
previous convictions dating back to 1982, Judge Simon Oliver highlighted
her previous stealing sprees across the UK, adding: 'At least you get 
to see the world if nothing else by your offending.'

He continued: 'Annette Daniel, 
because of the extent of your thieving in the two offences that you have
pleaded guilty to and bearing in mind your previous convictions you 
will go to prison for 18 months.'

The Glaswegian thief seemed far from concerned by the prison sentence.

She laughed and winked from the dock - even joking about the £100 victim surcharge imposed on her as the custody officer led her away to the cells, saying: 'How can we pay that if we're in prison?'

Isleworth Crown Court heard how Daniel and four friends attempted to steal almost £24,000 of designer handbags on a single shoplifting spree in November.

Daniel was captured on CCTV pointing to expensive goods, before her accomplice James Shearer, 38, loaded them into an M&S bag.

Roxanna Nasser, prosecuting, said: 'Annette Daniel was seen pointing to items which were then picked up by Mr Shearer and put into M&S bags.'

The gang of thieves successfully made it through one set of security barriers at the Knightsbridge store.

However, they were caught by the store's security guards soon after and Shearer assaulted a member of staff.

A search of the car the group travelled down from Scotland in revealed a further £1,195 of clothes they'd already stolen from clothes store Zara.

During an earlier shoplifting spree last May, Daniel, Donnelly and Tomlin stole a £5,000 Roberto Cavalli jacket and a £6,000 Ralph Lauren dress.

Mrs Nasser told the court: 'CCTV appears to show that these items are taken and stored in bags while they all walk out of the shop.'

The three women admitted two counts of conspiracy to steal.

James Shearer was jailed for two years for his part in the Harrods theft last November and for assaulting a security guard and kicking a cell door after he was caught.

Jean Donnelly, 46, and Shearer's brother Thomas, 33, acted as lookouts on that occasion, while another woman, Julieanne Tomlin, 34, was also involved in the theft.

All three women and Thomas Shearer admitted two counts of conspiracy to steal.

Thomas Shearer and Tomlin were jailed for 15 months each, while Donnell told the judge: 'Thank you your honour,' as she was sentenced to 18 months.

Jailing the five, Judge Simon Oliver said: 'On November 29th last year you stole goods to the value of £25,133.

'You came down from Glasgow to take those goods from Harrods and Zara.

'That was not the only time the three women came to London. On May 14 last year you were in Harrods again, this time taking a jacket and dress to the value of £11,345.'

He continued: 'These offences involved prior planning. You were working as a group, you were taking goods of high value and there would have been a high level of gain.
