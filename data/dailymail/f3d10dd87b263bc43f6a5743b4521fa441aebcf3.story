A primary school has been accused of imposing a Victorian punishment regime after it secretly forced its pupils to wear a humiliating ‘I am going to the toilet' sign.

Staff at Ashbrook Junior School in Borrowash, Derbyshire, made ten and 11-year-olds march to the lavatory with a label round their necks to improve discipline.

Only one boy at a time was allowed to use the toilet because of 'mess and damage', including urinating on seats and the floor.

Controversial: Ashbrook Primary School in Borrowash, Derbyshire, forced its pupils to wear a humiliating sign if they needed the toilet

The diktat was revealed when Thomas Hayes, 11, was pictured wearing the sign by his shocked sister Sophie, 16, who came to pick him up on Tuesday.

Riley Pearson, six, from near Slough, was suspended from his school after he took a bag of Mini Cheddars in his packed lunch before later being expelled for more food related problems.

Colnbrook C of E Primary School insisted he was not excluded 'for just having Mini Cheddars in their lunchbox' but because there had been a 'persistent and deliberate breach of school policy, such as bringing in crisps, biscuits, sausage rolls, mini sausages, scotch eggs and similar'.

A school is banning parents from watching their children play sport unless they pay £26 to undergo a criminal records check.

Last year parents at Isambard Community School in Swindon were told they must fill in a four-page form for the Criminal Records Bureau vetting process, which takes up to eight weeks to be completed.

Until that point, parents were not allowed to watch their children represent the school.

Friends of a 14-year-old boy who died after a long battle with cancer were sent home from school for refusing to remove wristbands worn in his memory.

Jordan Cobby, from Nuneaton, was diagnosed with a tumour behind his eye in 2008 and died aged 14.

Tribute wristbands in memory of Jordan were sold at his school, the Nuneaton Academy, following his death, with all proceeds donated to the Teenage Cancer Trust charity.

But the school banned pupils from wearing them in 2012, saying they are not part of the uniform, his mother Joanne Meuse said.

Father Darren Hayes compared the practice to something you might see in a 'Victorian workhouse'.

'I'm livid that the school did a humiliating thing like this to Thomas and his classmates,' he told The Sun.

'It's disgusting and degrading — the kind of thing you'd expect in a Victorian workhouse, not a school in 2014.

'I've told other parents about it and like me they had no idea this was being done. People
 are furious and I've no idea what the head and teachers thought they 
were playing at. That sign needs ripping up and chucking in the bin'.

Headteacher Mell Julian said the rule had been scrapped but they were still looking at 'alternatives' because of problems when more than one boy was in the toilets.

'We have had some issues recently with the way the Year 6 boys have been behaving in the toilets.  Some doors were damaged and sinks and toilets have been blocked leading to the toilet block flooding,' she said.

'To address this issue we produced a sign for boys to carry to the toilet to help us check that only one pupil was in there at a time.  One of our parents expressed concern with the signs and we immediately stopped using them.

'We are currently reviewing our procedures in light of the concerns raised.  We are sorry if this has caused any distress or upset.'

It
 came just days after a primary school teacher in Somerset was suspended
 for Sellotaping over the mouths of her 10-year-old pupils after they 
refused to stop giggling and talking.

Parents with children at the school said they were angry at the decision.

Lindsey Taylor, 32, whose six-year-old son Brandon is a pupil, said: 'I wouldn't be happy at all if he came home and told me he'd had to wear one of these signs.

'It's like they are being labelled as trouble-makers. It must have been pretty embarrassing for them to have walk around the corridors wearing it.'

Sarah Slaney, 31, has a seven-year-old son at the school.

She said: 'It's unbelievable. This should never have happened.

'There must have been a better way of dealing with this. To make a child wear a degrading sign around their neck isn't right at all.'

Mr Hayes, who revealed how son Thomas, 11, was forced to wear the 'degrading' sign, declined to comment further when contacted at his home half a mile from the school earlier today.

Priscila Davo Ortega, 27, allegedly lined up more than 20 children during her art lesson and put layers of sticky tape across their lips because they were being too noisy.

Parents said that when some children ripped off the tape because they were struggling to breathe, the Spanish-born teacher replaced it.

Other children were left with bleeding
 lips when the tape was removed, and several said that they were scared 
about returning to school.

Miss
 Ortega has been suspended from teaching art and Spanish at Danesfield 
Church of England middle school in Williton, Somerset, pending an 
investigation. Police said they would work with the local education 
authority.

Upset: Pupil Thomas Bradbury said some friendss had rashes after the Sellotape placed over their mouths to keep them quiet was torn off

Stacey Bradbury, 28, from Watchet, Somerset, said she was ‘disgusted, shocked, traumatised’ by Miss Ortega’s actions.

Her
10-year-old son Thomas said: ‘She put Sellotape on our mouths just 
because we were talking. Some people had a really bad rash after and 
some girls in my class had their lips bleeding.
