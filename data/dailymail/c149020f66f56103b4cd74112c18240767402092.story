An aspiring singer who auditioned for the The Voice and The X Factor has died at just 19-years-old.

Mollie Jones, a KFC branch manager, died after collapsing at work from a sudden brain haemorrhage.

The teenager fell ill at the fast-food restaurant at Charnock Richard services on the M6 in Lancashire on March 1st.

Miss Jones, from Coppall, Lancashire, was rushed to hospital, but was pronounced dead two days later.

Her heartbroken father Brendan Jones, 45, said music was her greatest passion and she loved singing.

She had auditioned for BBC's The Voice and ITV's The X Factor after studying performing arts at Newman College in Preston.

He said she had been got through several stages of the show, just missing out on being part of the televised programme.

He said: 'She could silence a room. I can't listen to the radio any more.'

Miss Jones would regularly sing at local venues such as the Rose and Crown pub, Chorley, the Alison Arms, Coppull and Coppull Conservative Club, he said.

He added that she enjoyed helping others with their hair and make up.

'She was into make up. She made people up getting married and going out on a do,' he said.

Mr Jones said he was shopping with his wife when they were told something was wrong with his daughter.

He said: 'We got a phone call from her boyfriend, Adam, who works with her, saying she's collapsed.

'We thought she'd fainted, not had enough to eat.

'She had had a bleed to her brain. There was no warning at all - it was just out of the blue. She was fit and healthy.

He added: 'It was thought it was meningitis at first. It was only at 11pm when we found out she had a bleed.'

Around 350 people attended her funeral, at Oswald's Church, Coppull, the Chorley Guardian reports.

Her family and friends have raised over £3,000 for children's hospice Derian House in her honour.
