An Australian navy warship has seized $183 million worth of heroin off the east coast of Africa.

Crews from the frigate HMAS Toowoomba were patrolling Indian Ocean waters when they boarded a vessel on Monday and seized 388kg of heroin in hessian bags.

The heroin seizure is one of the biggest hauls in recent years with East Africa becoming an export path for Afghan drugs en route to Europe, Reuters reports.

HMAS Toowoomba was deployed as part of the 30-country Coalition Maritime Forces to crack down on illegal activities in areas near the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. 

'The teams ashore and onboard the ship provided key pieces of the puzzle which led to this successful intercept,' commanding officer of HMAS Toowoomba Cath Hayes said. 

While the exact location of the heroin bust has not been revealed, other seizures have taken place near Kenya and Tanzania in the past.

Another Australian navy ship seized 1,023kg of heroin on a vessel near Kenya back in April.  

Regional maritime services have so far struggled to stop the flow of drugs due to a lack of funds and expertise in the anti-trafficking areas.
