Former president Bill Clinton and a local Planned Parenthood affiliate both endorsed San Diego's sex pest mayor Bob Filner as recently as last year, it emerged today.

Clinton has had his own female problems in Washington, most notably involving a sexual dalliance with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, and during his terms as Arkansas governor.

Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest provider of pregnancy terminations, and advocates a platform of defending women's health and abortion access.

'The "war on women" can be done at any level,' Filner said wryly on October 26, 2012, after a Planned Parenthood representative praised him for 'protecting our rights, and the rights of women and families'

'Bob has the experience to move San Diego forward,' Clinton said last year. 'As a Freedom Rider in the 1960s, Bob showed he has the courage to do what's right'

Clinton endorsed Filner when he was standing for election as the southern California city's chief executive, last October in a recorded message that Filner's supporters played at pre-election rallies, as KPBS first reported. 

The Daily Caller dug up the audio last week as Filner's troubles reached their peak and he announced he was entering counseling.

'As president I worked with Bob to save San Diego taxpayers more than $3 billion,' Clinton said then, 'and to secure funding for construction of a veterans home. Bob has the experience to move San Diego forward.'

'As a Freedom Rider in the 1960s, Bob showed he has the courage to do what's right. That's what he did in Congress, and that's exactly what he'll do as mayor of San Diego.'

The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, where the former president has an office, did not respond to a request for comment.

Planned Parenthood's endorsement was more specific to Filner's positions on women's issues.

San Diego mayor Bob Filner has been slammed on all fronts following allegations that he groped and sexually harassed more than a dozen women while in office

'For twenty years, Bob Filner has defended women,' wrote local Planned Parenthood chair Julie Bornstein (L) in a 2012 endorsement. 'Filner has a 100% voting record on women’s health'

'He is the only 100 per cent pro-choice in the race,' said an unidentified Planned Parenthood leader in a YouTube video shot at an October 26, 2012 rally.

He has 'worked tirelessly to protect Planned Parenthood from vicious ideological attacks in Congress,' she said, 'and spent the last 20 years in D.C. protecting our rights, and the rights of women and families.'

During the brief speech that followed, Filner encouraged voters to support him as they had previously during his runs for city council and Congress.

'The "war on women" can be done at any level,' he said.

The abortion rights group formally endorsed him in an email blast a few days before the election.

'For twenty years, Bob Filner has defended women… our right to choice, our right to healthcare, our right to equal pay,' wrote Planned Parenthood Action Fund of the Pacific Southwest chair Julie Bornstein.

'Filner has a 100% voting record on women’s health. He put the Lily Ledbetter Equal Pay for Women Act on President Obama’s desk.  Now, it’s the law.'

While women in Filner's 
administration may be paid as much as men, they have allegedly been 
subjected to the kind of attention he reserved for attractive female 
staffers.

So far 14 of them have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances and comments. Irene McCormack Jackson, his former communications director, has sued Filner in San Diego County Superior Court, seeking unspecified damages for sexual harassment.

Michelle Tyler (R) gave an August 6 press conference with her attorney Gloria Allred (L), during which she alleged that Filner made inappropriate advances on her while she was seeking help for a disabled Marine

Monica Lewinsky (L), shown with then-President Clinton, told congressional investigators that he had sexual contact with Clinton in a hallway near the Oval Office

Many of the women have told media outlets similar stories, describing initial meetings with Filner on official business during which he allegedly made by sexually inappropriate comments and asked them out on dates.

In a few cases, the women have claimed he kissed or sexually touched them.

Polls of San Diegans show that between two-thirds and three-quarters of them want their mayor to resign, but he has insisted that he's not going quietly.

On Tuesday the Associated Press reported that he will fight an effort to remove him through a voter referendum. 'As your Mayor, I am committed to moving San Diego forward!' he wrote in an official response to a citizens' recall effort.

Filner, said recall chairman Michael Pallamary in a statement to the AP, 'obviously believes his policy initiatives excuse his being a sexual predator. His reply is unacceptable.'

'San Diegans want a mayor that doesn't grope and demean women, who doesn't abuse his office to satisfy a perverted quest for a sense of power, and who has the ability to lead our great city — an ability Filner can never, ever reclaim.'

The San Diego city council and California Sen. Barbara Boxer – a longtime Filner ally – have added their voices to the chorus calling for him to leave office.

On Tuesday a Yahoo News reporter spotted Planned Parenthood's 2012 campaign mailer that praised Filner as an advocate for women

Planned Parenthood almost universally supports Democratic politicians. This group protested outside the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa
