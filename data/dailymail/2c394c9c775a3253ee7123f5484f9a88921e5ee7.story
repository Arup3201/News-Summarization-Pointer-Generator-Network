An aquarium has been urged to stop throwing after-hours parties by an animal welfare group who believe they could cause distress to the marine life with fish even 'attacking each other out of frustration'.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) have written to aquarium executives at the SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium in the city's Darling Harbour, claiming that 'aquariums that market themselves as party venues create even more of a nightmare for the animals at these facilities'.

However, the aquarium's curator, Gerhard Beukes, insisted that animal welfare was paramount at all exhibitions and the staff prided themselves on providing the highest possible standard of care for the aquatic life.

An aquarium has been urged to stop throwing after-hours parties by animal welfare group PETA

PETA says the parties could cause distress to the marine life with fish even 'attacking each other out of frustration'

'All functions are developed in coordination with our curatorial staff to ensure they do not exceed the aquarium's normal day-to-day noise levels and are aimed to provide an intimate evening at the aquarium while maintaining an appropriate end time to benefit the animals,' Mr Beukes said.

'Our curatorial staff are onsite to monitor the animals at all times during any function or event; this includes the use of decibel meters to monitor sound as well as restrictions on the use of additional lighting, decorations and equipment.' 

Sydney Aquarium has thrown a string of limited-edition 18+ events run by non-profit arts company The Festivalists, called Hijinks, in recent months where DJs and artists entertain guests to help raise awareness around crucial marine conservation issues

Pop-up bars are also set up inside the aquarium and the Hijink's website promises party goers can 'grab a drink at the pop up bars serving Little Creatures beers or SKYY Vodka cocktails, take selfies with Grey Nurse sharks, chat with conservationists or simply get a head start on the weekend'.

The event also says attendees can 'reclaim the aquarium as their own over the course of a wild and eventful evening'.

In the strongly-worded letter to FBi Radio and Sea Life Sydney Aquarium executives, PETA said: 'Events such as this, which take place outside normal opening hours, while animals would normally be resting, are likely to have a detrimental impact on aquarium residents, particularly if the visitors behave in a manner that causes the animals stress.'

 PETA reasoned: 'As you can imagine, loud parties and captive animals are a bad mix. 

'Employees at aquariums have themselves said that the animals become extremely agitated during these events, even attacking one another out of frustration.

'Experts have stated that anthropogenic noise at high levels can affect animal behaviour, mask important natural sounds on which they depend, alter their physiological function and physically injure them.'

In their plea PETA said marine animals in small tanks already experience 'enough stress'.

'Events with loud sounds held at aquariums are debilitating to these animals, who have no other choice in dealing with their frustration and discomfort but to swim around in endless circles.

'Aquariums should be responsible for the safety of the animals in their care. Allowing these late-night events to continue does not demonstrate adequate consideration for animal welfare,' they added.

During the events so far the aquarium's dugongs, which have acute hearing and sensitivity to sound, have not been present as their part of the centre was being renovated.

On Hijink's Facebook page this week they announced: 'If you missed Pig & Wuru, as their home was undergoing massive renovations. Good news: the dugongs are back for Hijinks Halloween on October 30th. Lettuce for everyone!'

But PETA says that parties could have a' detrimental impact on the aquarium residents'
