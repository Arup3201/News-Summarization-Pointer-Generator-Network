After spending yesterday evening in the company of the literary world's biggest names, the Duchess of Cornwall's week took on an earthier tone as she arrived at a harvest festival today.

The duchess was the guest of honour at Westminster Abbey's autumn celebrations and despite the inclement weather, appeared in good spirits as she arrived at the cathedral.

Resplendent in a royal blue collarless coat, a matching hat and an exquisite pair of weighty pearl earrings, the duchess was greeted by the Dean of Westminster, John Hall, on the abbey steps before being ushered inside.

Before making her way into the UNESCO listed abbey, Camilla spent a few moments chatting with the assembled crowd and was presented with a stunning bouquet made up of autumnal orange roses and crimson rosehips.

Later, she was shown a pair of enormous Shire horses, their black manes entwined with gaily green and red ribbons, and obligingly gave one a pat on the nose.

It was all a far cry from last night's engagement, which saw the duchess take centre stage at London's Guildhall during the presentation of the Man Booker prize.

Elegant in a black velvet gown and diamond earrings, she presented 28-year-old author Eleanor Catton - the youngest winner ever - with the prestigious prize for her novel The Luminaries.

In a speech made ahead of the prize giving, the duchess, who is known to be an avid reader, said: 'The whole point of this prize is not just to reward the masters of well-honed prose, but to celebrate the astonishing and intoxicating breadth, depth and beauty of the written word.

'I get as much pleasure reading to my grandchildren as I do getting lost in my own favourite writers.

'The power of great literature is immense, a key to other kingdoms, an escape from the dull and mundane. And many will discover this great and lifelong pleasure thanks to the Man Booker Prize.'

Despite arriving home late, Camilla was up early this morning for a private meeting with Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands, during which the pair discussed the problem of falling literacy rates, according to Clarence House.

During the meeting, the duchess and Princess Laurentien, who is the wife of King Willem-Alexander's younger brother, Prince Constantijn, appeared to enjoy each other's company and chatted happily.

But with the harvest festival looming, it wasn't long before the duchess was back in a car en route to central London and Westminster Abbey.
