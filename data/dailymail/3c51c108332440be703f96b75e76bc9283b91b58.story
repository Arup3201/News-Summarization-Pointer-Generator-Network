Love game: Darren White, 41, was discovered lying face down on his bed with a metal chain padlocked tightly around his neck

A businessman found dead in a hotel bedroom, with a chain tightly padlocked around his neck, may have suffocated when a sex game went wrong, an inquest heard.

Darren White, 41, was discovered lying face down on the bed, surrounded by sex toys.

The body was already decomposed as it had  laid undiscovered for several days and pathologist Dr Peter Jerreat told the inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court that it was impossible to determine a cause of death.

Mr Jerreat said: ‘Potentially this could mask someone being suffocated under the influence of drugs.It is possible to have suffocated during a sexual act.

‘I’m definitely not excluding third party involvement,' he added.

A violent sex film was in the DVD player
when staff found Mr White’s body, and drugs paraphernalia was also 
recovered.

Mr White, originally from Colchester, Essex, had recently taken over forklift truck company United Lift Trucks.

He had checked in to a serviced flat on the fourth floor of Hotel Think in Long Lane, Southwark, on December 30, after a skiing trip to Switzerland. 

On January 3, the final day of his stay, a receptionist rang his room at around 11am after he failed to check out, the inquest heard.

Even after using a master key to unlock the room, staff were unable to push the door open more than a crack and instead put mobile phones through the gap to survey the scene.

They then realised Mr White, of Tenpenny Hill, Thorrington, Essex, was dead.

Pc John Willmor, one of the first officers to arrive in the hotel room, said he found Mr White’s decomposing body lying face down on the bed with the chain around his neck.

‘I could tell he was deceased and had been there for a matter of days rather than hours,’ he said.

‘We looked around, and there were numerous...what I would describe as sex toys, around the room.

‘The television was on and there was a DVD playing at the time - I would describe it as some extremely violent sex acts.’

A
further ten pornographic films were found in the room, along with a 
bloodstained towel, and a DVD case containing white powder believed to 
be drugs.

Police also failed to test the powder or examine Mr White’s laptop and mobile phone, the inquest was told.

In
a statement read to the hearing, his father, Brian White, said his son 
had been working long hours for 18 months after buying his company.

‘This
was his first venture into business on his own, and he had been told by
some of the staff to slow down, as he was starting to sleep during the 
lunch hour,’ he said.

‘I think that the pressure of the business took its toll, and wore him out.

‘I did notice, from November 2011, he started to look tired, but he wouldn’t confide in me.’

Recording
a narrative verdict, assistant deputy coroner Shanta Deonarine said: 
‘I’ve no option but to record and open conclusion.

‘I
specifically make mention that I cannot rule out whether or not there 
was third party involvement and therefore I make no specific finding 
that it is expressly ruled out.’

A
police spokeswoman said the death was deemed to be non-suspicious, and 
no request had been received from the coroner to mount a fresh 
investigation.
