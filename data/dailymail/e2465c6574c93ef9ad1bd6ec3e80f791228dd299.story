Isobel Pooley rose to the occasion on the penultimate night of athletics at Hampden Park, winning Commonwealth high jump silver with a personal best of 1.92 metres.

The 21-year-old entered Friday evening's final as an outsider, having been outjumped this year by heptathletes Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Morgan Lake.

However, Pooley shone as she cleared her first five jumps at the first attempt, including a personal best of 1.92m.

Leap: The 21-year-old claimed a silver medal with a personal best jump of 1.92 metres n Glasgow

Australian teenager Eleanor Patterson eventually snuck ahead with a jump of 1.94m to take gold, with Pooley taking silver ahead of St Lucia's Levern Spencer on countback.

'I went for it, I lost control and it turned out okay,' Pooley told BBC Sport.

'The leap took a lot of confidence. I dreamt about being consistent, but my second attempt I am very proud of.'

There was more English medal joy in the women's discus as Jade Lally's season best of 60.48m secured bronze, while the 4 x 400m relay teams progressed with ease.

Emily Diamond, Shana Cox, Margaret Adeoye and Christine Ohuruogu qualified for the women's final on Saturday in three minutes 27.88 seconds - the fastest time of the night.

'It was nice to finally get out there,' Ohuruogu said. 'I've been stuck inside for the last week.

Disbelief: Pooley was shocked as she realised she had claimed a medal at Hampden Park on Friday

'The roar [when handed the baton] was so cool. I didn't miss the individual 400m to be honest, I really didn't.

'It's the first championship I've ever done in 10 years where I've just sat and watched. I'm glad I passed it up.'

While world champion Ohuruogu led England home, the home crowd at Hampden Park were left frustrated.

Scotland's decision to rest Glasgow 2014 poster girl Eilidh Child after her 400m silver on Thursday cost them as they finished ninth in the rankings, just 0.24secs slower than India, who qualified as a fastest loser.

The hosts fared better in the men's event, though, with the team of Kris Robertson, Jamie Bowie, Greg Louden and Grant Plenderleith qualifying as a fastest loser.

They join England in the final after the quartet of Daniel Awde, Matthew Hudson-Smith, Nigel Levine and Conrad Williams qualified in three mins 3.01s - the quickest time of the night.
