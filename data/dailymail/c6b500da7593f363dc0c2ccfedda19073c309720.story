A radicalized Muslim convert from Ohio who was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly plotting a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol is a 'peace-loving momma's boy', his father has insisted.

Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, had planned to detonate pipe bombs in the U.S. Capitol before opening fire on fleeing government officials in December 2015, according to a criminal complaint.

But his father isn't buying it - and says he believes the FBI set his son up.

'They've already painted him as some kind of terrorist,' John Cornell told the Cincinnati Enquirer. '(Christopher) is one of the most peace-loving people I know.'

Defense: John Cornell, whose son Christopher Cornell was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly planning a terrorist attack on the U.S. Capitol, insisted his son was just a 'vulnerable kid'

Speaking from their home in Green Township, Cornell, 60, claimed his son was a 'momma's boy who never left' their apartment and said he still loves him despite the charges.

'I think he was a really vulnerable kid, just a big kid,' he said. 

His mother, Angela Carmen, added to WCPO: 'He was a good kid, I mean, he would do anything in the world for you. He would not hurt nobody.'

His father told CNN: 'His best friend is his kitty cat. There's no way he could have carried out any kind of terrorist plot. He didn't even drive; he didn't have a car.'

Cornell added to ABC that he does not think his son could have devised a terror plot on his own and believes that an FBI informant, with whom his son allegedly exchanged messages and met in person, duped him.

'He told me he had went to a mosque and now I know, in hindsight I know, he was meeting with an FBI agent,' he said. 'And they were taking him somewhere, and they were filling his head with a lot of this garbage.'

The parents added that he only had around $1,200 in his bank account - not enough to fund a terror plot or pay for the two guns he bought before his arrest on Wednesday.

'These guns cost almost $2,000. Where did that money come from? Well, it came from the FBI,' his father said. 'They set him up.' 

After high school, where he was a wrestler, Cornell worked at Kohl's and spent a lot of time playing video games in his room, his parents said. At the time of his arrest he was unemployed.

They believe their son took an interest in Islam about two months ago - which contradicts the FBI's narrative. 

Cornell Sr., who is himself not a Muslim, said his son attended Masjid Abue Baker Siddikue mosque in South Fairmount and had found peace in the religion.  

After turning to Islam, Christopher Cornell became a target for bullies because of his long beard and tradition Muslim clothing, and his father said he discouraged him from talking about it too much in case he offended others. Still, the older Cornell said he supported his son's religion.

'Hey, that's my son and I love him just the same,' he said.

His parents said the first they knew of his arrest or alleged criminal plot was when the FBI turned up at their door on Wednesday and seized their son's electronic devices. 

Christopher Cornell, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, was arrested by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, after leaving a gun store on Wednesday morning.

Inside the store, he had been sold M-15 two semi-automatic rifles and 600 rounds of ammunition after staff checked that he had no criminal record.

He was taken into custody on charges of attempting to kill a government official and possession of a firearm, according to a criminal complaint.  

Cornell first showed up on the FBI's radar several months ago after he sent out a tweet in support of violent 'jihad', according to government documents. 

An investigation into Cornell's activities revealed videos and other online statements backing the deadly extremist organization ISIS, also known as ISIL or Islamic State. 

According to the FBI, the 20-year-old also exchanged messages with an undercover federal informant about his desire to launch Islamic State-style attacks on US soil.

'I believe that we should just wage jihad under our own orders and plan attacks and everything,' Cornell allegedly wrote in August. 'I believe we should meet up and make our own group in alliance with the Islamic State here and plan operations ourselves.'  

In instant messages to the undercover informant, Cornell indicated that while he did not have support to conduct an attack on behalf of any group, 'we already got a thumbs up from the Brothers over there and Anwar al Awlaki before his martyrdom and many others'. 

Caught red-handed: Cornell was arrested Wednesday morning at the Point Blank gun store in Cincinnati. He had saved up his money to buy the two rifles and 600 rounds of ammunition, according to authorities

Awlaki, an American-born radical imam, was killed in a US drone strike in Yemen in 2011. 

Cornell also researched the construction of pipe bombs, saved up money to purchase semi-automatic rifles and 600 rounds of ammunition and made plans to travel to Washington on a reconnaissance mission, according to the FBI informant. 

He met with the informant four times last fall and during one meeting in November, Cornell said he considered members of Congress to be his enemies, according to the documents.

The criminal complaint says the FBI informant began supplying agents with information about Cornell last year in return for favorable treatment in an unrelated criminal case.

Government officials say Cornell's suspected terror plot was in the early stages of development; he planned to carry out an attack in December 2015.

The FBI says the public was never in danger and he never made it to Washington.

'The alleged activities of Cornell highlight the continued interest of U.S.-based violent extremists to support designated foreign terrorist organizations overseas, such as ISIL, by committing terrorist acts in the United States,' read an FBI and Department of Homeland Security bulletin.

Targeted: Cornell allegedly planned to blow up pipe bombs in the Capitol and open fire on fleeing government employees sometime in December 2015. He called members of Congress 'my enemies'

Role model: Cornell allegedly told an FBI informant that radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki had been in favor of terrorist attack before his 'martyrdom' in 2011

'Terrorist group members and supporters will almost certainly continue to use social media platforms to disseminate English language violent extremist messages.'

Cornell's arrest came only days after a grand jury indictment charged another Cincinnati-area resident with threatening to murder House Speaker John Boehner.

'Once again, the entire Congress owes a debt of gratitude to the FBI and all those who keep us safe,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said in a statement on Wednesday.

Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, praised the FBI and other law enforcement agencies for their work 'to thwart this potential terrorist act'.

'It is an important reminder of the very real threat that radical Islam continues to pose to the homeland,' he said. 

The Islamic State militant organization, which broke with the al-Qaeda network and took control of large parts of Iraq and Syria, has drawn jihadi fighters from across the Muslim world and Europe. 

It has been blamed for violence such as the beheadings of foreign captives including a former U.S. soldier turned aid worker and two American journalists.
