Police Inspector Julie Pillott says police don't know for sure how the fight started but it may have been just a bump during dancing.

'The victim believes he was bitten and it appears that might be the case,' she said.

It is believed the club was hosting an event for the the Fijian Indian community.

The injured man, who had his bottom of his lobe bitten off, has since been released from hospital but has declined to provide a statement to police.

The biter is yet to be identified and police are urging witnesses to come forward.

Inspector Pillott said police will also review CCTV footage.
