The apartment allegedly booby-trapped by James Holmes, the Colorado theater gunman, is to be rented again, 18 months after the massacre.

More than 30 homemade grenades and ten gallons of gasoline was discovered in Holmes' North Aurora apartment in Colorado the day after the shooting which killed 12 people and wounded 70 in a screening of The Dark Knight Rises on July 20 last year.

Now the one bed, one bathroom 650 sq meter apartment is available to rent for $850 a month according to TMZ.com.

A sophisticated maze of improvised 
explosive devices (IEDs) and trip wires or trigger mechanisms were also 
secured from the apartment, the Denver Post reported at the time.

arrested in the parking lot shortly after.

One of the victims' families is said to be outraged that the apartment is back on the market.

Wired: The court heard in October how police were considering letting the bombs in the apartment (as advertised today) go off and the building burn down because they originally thought it was safer than attempting to diffuse them

Bill Hoover, whose grandson A.J. Boik was killed in the shooting, said: ‘The place should be burned down or bulldozed.

‘I don't think anyone would want to stay there if they knew the evil acts that were done.’

The apartment is advertised as renovated and furnished. According to Zillow.com, the apartment is described as: 'Only two blocks from University 
Hospital and all the amenities of Fitzsimons. Completely renovated and 
furnished. We also pay heat which make this a steal at $850.'

In court in October this year, Lt Thomas
 Wilkes testified that the explosives found in the apartment were so 
sophisticated that police were originally going to let them go off and 
the building burn down as they thought it was safer than attempting to 
diffuse them.

During the July 2012 investigation of 
the apartment, a law enforcement official told CNN that grenades were 
wired to a control box in the kitchen, resembling setups that are more 
often seen in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He said that if they had went off as intended, the walls of nearby apartments would have been knocked down.

Holmes helped police officers diffuse the cache of alleged explosives, the court heard.

The trial is scheduled to start again in February 2014 and the Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour Jr said prospective jurors should be warned that the trial could last eight months.
