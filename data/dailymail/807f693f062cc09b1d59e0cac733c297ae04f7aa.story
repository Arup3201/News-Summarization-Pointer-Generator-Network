While it's believed that neither of them have actually contacted a divorce lawyer, they are now allegedly 'separated', according to the website.

TMZ claims that people close to the NBA star have been unable to find or contact him for the last 72 hours, although a representative for the star has denied this.

Representatives for Lamar did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment.

Earlier this week the Kardashian family allegedly staged an intervention to convince Lamar to return to rehab, but he refused, reports the gossip website.

Khloe urged Lamar in August 2012 to go to rehab and after he entered a San Diego facility she hired private investigators to make sure he didn't leave.

Lamar reportedly constantly threatened to leave the rehab clinic and Khloe visited several times to convince him to stay, but he left after three weeks, sources said.

Khloe was convinced of recent reports of Lamar's infidelity, but feels his drug abuse has been the main problem, the website reported.
