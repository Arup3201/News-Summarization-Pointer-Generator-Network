Frozen Snow Glow Elsa toys are going for as much as £79.99 online, a 130 per cent markup on their original price of £34.99 after selling out in stores

A nightmare looms for parents this Christmas with evidence there is a desperate shortage of Britain’s best-selling doll.

Stores are unable to keep up with demand for Frozen Snow Glow Elsa, an interactive doll who sings, speaks and lights up, with an official price of £34.99.

Many household chains and websites, such as Tesco, Toys r Us and Argos, list it as being ‘unavailable’, while any new stock is being snapped up as soon as it arrives on shelves.

Such is demand from parents desperate to avoid tears on Christmas morning that eBay entrepreneurs are cashing in by charging as much as £79.99 – a mark-up of almost 130per cent.

Elsa, the lead character from Disney’s Frozen film, is driving a phenomenal surge in sales in a wide range of merchandise linked to the inspirational animated fairytale.

Sales of dolls and merchandise linked to the Disney film are on course to hit all-time high for any movie franchise – overtaking the phenomenally successful Toy Story.

While Toy Story sales were driven by versions of Buzz Lightyear and Woody, it is the Frozen Snow Glow Elsa which is number one on wish lists this year.

Elsa’s dress lights up and she will sing and speak phrases from the film when owners touch her magical snowflake necklace.

The current top five toy best-selling toys also includes a Frozen Ice Skating Elsa Doll, which is £29.99, and an interactive Frozen Toddler Doll for younger children at £39.99.

UK sales of all Frozen merchandise, from dressing up outfits to dolls and jigsaws, are put at £31m up until the week ending November 8, according to retail experts at The NPD Group.

Global toys industry analyst for NPD, Frederique Tutt, said: ‘New items have been launched, production has been increased to meet demand, and sales are getting stronger. 

‘We counted three Frozen dolls in the five best-selling toys last week alone.

‘If Frozen continues at this level until Christmas, not only will the license keep top spot and get the license of the year accolade but it will also beat the all-time record of Toy Story 3 – in 2010 - in terms of toy sales.’

Sales of Frozen toys are set to hit an all-time high, outstripping the Buzz Lightyear dolls that set a record after Toy Story was released. Frozen has already beaten Toy Story 3 to the top grossing animated movie spot

While Toy Story merchandise was most popular with boys, Frozen is clearly a favourite for girls.

The storyline is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale The Snow Queen and tells how a fearless princess sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer and a snowman to find her sister, Anna, who has become trapped in a land of eternal winter.

The film overtook Toy Story 3 to become the biggest grossing animated film of all time earlier this year with ticket sales of more than £1billion, while the song ‘Let it Go’ won an Oscar and became a social media phenomenon.

Such is the demand for themed merchandise that there were reports of fights among women shoppers at the opening of a new Poundworld in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales.

Just last week, police were called to a toy store in Dublin to calm shoppers who battling to get hold of a Snow Glow Elsa doll.

Gary Grant, the boss of The Entertainer toy chain, said: ‘Demand is just unbelievable. The film launched last year, but this is the year that sales of themed products have really caught on.

‘We have major stock issues in terms of keeping up with demand. The numbers are just vast.

‘We sell more jigsaw puzzles based on Frozen than all others put together. I have never seen anything like it. I suspect even Disney has been surprised.

‘Quite frankly, you could sell empty boxes if they had Frozen written on them.’

1. Frozen Snow Glow Elsa £34.99

2. Kidizoom Smartwatch £39.99

3. LeapPad Explorer Tablet £79.99

4. Frozen Ice Skating Doll £29.99

5. Frozen Toddler Doll (15in) £39.99

Mr Grant said Frozen has outpaced any previous film in terms of the sales of themed toys.

‘Stocks of the dolls are coming in all the time, but if I get 2,000 of the interactive dolls they would be gone by the end of the week. It is bigger than Toy Story and Buzz Lightyear ever was.’

The other products on the top five best sellers stand out because they incorporate technology which mimics devices used by adults.

The Kidizoom Smartwatch, which is made by Vtech and costs £39.99, includes a stills and video camera, a voice recorder and a series of games.

Mike Lynch of Vtech said the watch will help prepare youngsters for the technology they will need and use in later life.

‘It takes adult technology and puts it into a child friendly toy. It has all the features you would want from a watch, in terms of a digital and analogue clock display as well as a stop watch.

‘There are games and a voice recorder that allows children to add some funny effects, like a robotic sound. There is a two megapixel camera for stills and video.’

Also on the list is the £79.99 LeapPad Explorer, an iPad-style tablet for toddlers, which includes eBooks, hundreds of educational games and apps, as well as a camera.
