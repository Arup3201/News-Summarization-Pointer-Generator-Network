One of the brothers behind Britain's first cereal café has written an open letter to Channel 4 complaining about an excruciating interview which made a 'mockery' of him.

Gary Keely, who founded Cereal Killer Cafe with his twin brother Alan, was challenged over selling bowls for £3.20 in one of the most deprived areas of London.

The hipster seemed to be caught unaware by Symeon Brown's questions and even claimed that the niche cafe, which opened earlier in Tower Hamlets this week, was 'cheap'.

But he has now responded by saying the interview was 'completely unfair' and said the journalist did not even pay for his bowl, despite the fact he was wearing an 'overpriced River Island suit'.

He also jokingly pointed out he was not the man to solve the property crisis in London as he was 'too busy trying to cure Ebola and getting Kim Kardashian to keep her clothes on'. 

'First of all you tried to blame me for the property prices in London before attacking me with questions about poverty,' he wrote on the café's Facebook page.

'I am a small business owner and am gambling everything I have in this business and you try to make a mockery out of me.

'I have a million things going on in my head and one of those things was about helping local charities as I am not the selfish **** you have made me out to be.

'You obviously don't understand business if you think I don't have to put a mark-up on what I sell.'

He said the journalist did not even pay for his bowl, despite the fact he was wearing an 'overpriced River Island suit'

He said he has to pay 'over the top rent' as well as paying his 12 staff, so he either has to make a profit or run out of business.

'Maybe if I charged over £3 for a coffee and dodged all the taxes in this country like some cafés - the reporters would leave me alone would they,' he said. 

The brothers, from Belfast, opened their venture earlier this week on Brick Lane - a hipster hotspot and home to a number of quirky cafes.

After tasting one of the 120 varieties on offer, priced at £3.20, Mr Brown asked the cafe owner whether he thought it was a lot to charge for a bowl.

The restaurateur seemed surprised by the question and responded saying, 'I think it is quite cheap for the area'.

He was challenged by the interviewer, who pointed out that the cafe is in one of the poorest parts of London - and asked again whether £3 seemed like a premium price.

Mr Keely tried to justify the extraordinary cost and explained that many of the brands are 'imported from America'.

The journalist then asked what this means for the people who live in the area, where the proportion of children living in poverty has nearly reached 50 per cent.

Mr Keely responded saying, 'Well, if they are poor, probably not then.'

The cafe owner then became defensive and started asking to stop the interview because 'he doesn't like the questions'.

In his open letter, Mr Keely said he would be sending the journalist the bill from his unpaid cereal, signing it from 'the worst person in the world'.

He also brought up the fact that he was brought up in one of the most deprived areas in Belfast.

'My family know all about poverty but haven't had to blame the small business owners in the area for it, I have been taught a great work ethic and have made it this far without blaming small business owners trying to better themselves and make a future for themselves.'

The café plays on nostalgia, with limited-edition boxes and collectibles proudly displayed on furniture reminiscent of yesteryear.

They also employ a 'mixologist' - who combines different types of cereal for customers looking for something different.

The cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner - meaning cereal aficionados can get their fix pretty much any time of day.

Behind the counter, brightly-coloured boxes line the walls and offerings are as diverse as Golden Grahams and Reese's Puffs to Cap'n Crunch and Apple Jacks.

When asked about his favourite cereal, Mr Keeley said: 'I really love the Boo-berry, Count Chocula and Franken-berry – these are limited-edition Halloween cereals that are only available one month of the year in America.

'We've got these, but really limited-edition, so we've only got about 20 boxes of them.' 

Channel 4 News and Symeon Brown were not available for a comment when contacted.

Imported: Mr Keely says that the reason the cereals cost so much is because some are American brands

Located in east London, Tower Hamlets has the highest rate of child poverty in the country - it reached 49 per cent this year, up from 42 per cent last year. 

It also has the second highest unemployment rate in London. Every ward has a higher proportion of people claiming out of work benefits than the London average. 

But the problems are by no means confined to the economic - Tower Hamlets also has very high rates of long term illness and premature death.

Yet this is only half the picture. Tower Hamlets also has some of the highest paid people in London, working in the financial district of Canary Wharf, which has European headquarters for HSBC, Citibank and Barclays. 

The proportion of jobs in Tower Hamlets that are low paid is one of the smallest in the capital.

The borough also boasts booming Brick Lane, which lies at the centre of Britain's hipster culture and is home to a number of quirky bars and restaurants.

At a number of these establishments, including the Cereal Killer Cafe, customers can expect to pay a premium for the out-of-the-ordinary experiences. 

Just down the road from Cereal Killer Cafe is Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium. There, visitors pay £5 to book a table in the cafe, which is home to a number of rescue cats.
