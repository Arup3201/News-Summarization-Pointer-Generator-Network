For most expectant mothers, an 8lb baby is more than enough to deal with.

So spare a thought for Sarah Chiad, who carried two of them.

Her daughter and son, Hannah and Thomas, had a combined weight of 17lb 8oz, almost double the average for twins.

Hannah weighed 8lb 13oz and Thomas 8lb 11oz when they were born by caesarean section on January 11.

It means they are among the largest pairs of mixed-sex twins ever born in the UK.

Mrs Chiad had watched her waist grow to 57 inches during her pregnancy so she knew her babies would be big – just not that big.

But for the 38-year-old, all that 
matters is that the twins are healthy. She and her husband, Thomas, had 
endured three miscarriages in the past, including the loss of another 
set of twins.

She suffers from a rare blood-clotting
disorder called Hughes syndrome or ‘sticky blood,’ which is one of the 
biggest causes of recurrent miscarriage. Clots form in the placenta, 
causing the pregnancy to fail.

Sibling love: Sarah, 38, had an inkling the twins she was expecting might be bigger than normal when her bump measured a whopping 57 inches

When Mrs Chiad became pregnant for the
first time she was expecting twins, but that pregnancy ended in a 
heartbreaking miscarriage.

She was still oblivious to the blood 
problem when she later gave birth to 6lb 12oz Christopher, who is now 
nine. She said: ‘When he was delivered the placenta was full of clots 
and it was a miracle he survived.’ Mrs Chiad and her husband, a 
41-year-old electronics engineer, tried for more children and two more 
miscarriages followed.

She was not given any tests in the UK,
but when the family spent a period living in Austria she told a local 
doctor about her history and Hughes syndrome was ‘diagnosed straight 
away’.

The miscarriage risk is easily treated
with blood-thinning drugs and as a result Rebekah was born, weighing 
9lb 3oz. She is now five.

The world's heaviest pair of twins weighed a total of 27lbs 12oz and were born to Mary Ann Ward Haskin on 20 February 1924 in Arkansas, USA - Patricia Jane weighed 14lbs and John Prosser weighed 13lbs 2oz. Patricia Jane is the heaviest twin ever born.

The world's lightest surviving twins, weighing a total of 1lb 8.5oz, were Courtney (12oz) and Chloe (12.5oz) Smith, born in Louisiana, USA, on 1 March 2000

The twins born furthest apart were Timothy and Celeste Keys, born 95 days apart on 15 October 1993 and 18 January 199, in Louisiana, USA

After slimming down to 15 stone from 
21 stone, Mrs Chiad then decided to try for a third baby. She said: ‘We 
ended up with two instead of one. It was a shock but a nice surprise.’

She found out she was expecting twins at a seven-week scan, and was 
again given medication to prevent her blood clotting.

The pregnancy went without a hitch and the twins were born at 37 weeks.

‘When I saw them for the first time they were big but normal babies. I didn’t realise they were anything unusual,’ she said.

The average twin is around 5lb so staff at Chesterfield Royal Hospital were stunned when they weighed Hannah and Thomas.

The UK record for mixed-sex twins is a
combined 18lb 12oz and Mrs Chiad believes she would have broken it had 
she gone to full term. ‘I knew they were going to be big but didn’t 
expect this,’ she said. ‘My health visitor said in 20 years she has 
never known such big twins.’

The babies, now five weeks old, are 
flourishing at home in Hasland, Derbyshire under the careful eye of 
their parents and older siblings.

Mrs Chiad said: ‘Rebekah and Christopher wanted one of each so they were delighted when they found out.’

Sarah said: 'They are getting on very well and are good babies. They already look so different and have different personalities'

Achoo! According to Sarah, Thomas, right, is very chilled out while Hannah, left, is a bit more fussy
