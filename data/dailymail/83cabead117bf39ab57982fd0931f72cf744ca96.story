Relatives of soldiers killed in Iraq spoke of their prolonged agony as it emerged the inquiry into the war has been delayed until late next year.

Sir John Chilcot’s report, initially due out in 2011, has been beset by more delays due to an ongoing secrecy row with the Government, which is blocking publication of classified documents.

A source revealed it is now likely to be published at the end of next year if not early 2014 if the issues are not resolved soon.

Delay: The Chilcot inquiry was set up three years ago to get to the bottom of former prime minister Tony Blair’s decision to join the US in war against Saddam Hussein in 2003, and conduct until the withdrawal of British troops in 2009

Reg Keys, whose son Lance Corporal Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003 aged 20, said the new delay was ‘frustrating’ and suggested waiting any longer would diminish its impact.

The inquiry was set up by Gordon Brown three years ago to get to the bottom of the Government’s decision to join the USA in going to war against Saddam Hussein in March 2003, and conduct right up to the withdrawal of British troops in July 2009.

But Sir John’s five-strong panel of academics and former diplomats have met resistance from the civil service to publishing key documents, in particular transcripts of phone conversations between George W Bush and Tony Blair in the run-up to the conflict.

Mr Keys, of Llanuwchllyn, North Wales, who founded the campaign group Military Families Against the War said: ‘The report was due to be published in 2011 when it was still a very hot potato, but by the time we eventually see it, people might think it was all a long time ago and that it doesn’t really matter any more.

‘I can understand why Mr Blair and a few others don’t want things to come out, because there was deceit behind closed doors. 

‘But for me and the other families, the delays just keep poking a wound that you’re trying to heal. You try to put things in a box, but until this is done and dusted you can’t move on.’ 

In July, Sir John wrote to David Cameron to warn him about delays in persuading the government to declassify ‘a significant volume of currently classified material’ that he believed the public should see.

This is thought to relate to the intelligence produced by M15, M16. GCHQ and the Joint Intelligence Committee regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction; and key question of whether Mr Blair promised to back the US invasion before he had the backing of parliament.

Sir John predicted the panel might contact those who would be criticised in the report in the summer of 2013 to give them the right to reply. But it is understood his team are still in deadlock with the Cabinet Office.A source told the Daily Telegraph: ‘The big issue still remains the inquiry’s belief that it should be able to publish documents that the Cabinet Office is still withholding.

‘Sir John is hoping to send letters out to people next summer to invite their responses to any criticisms he might intend to include in his report.

Their responses could take weeks or months to come back, then the inquiry will have to consider whether it needs to change the wording of the report in the light of their responses.

‘So it’s likely to be well into well into the autumn before anything is published.’ 

The inquiry -which took evidence from 150 witnesses with its last public hearing last February - has cost more than £6million and the year-long delay is set to cost an extra £1.4million. His report is expected to run to a million words.

It was claimed last night that a secret document relating to discussions between George W Bush and Tony Blair has not been provided by the Cabinet Office nine months after it was ordered to do so by the Information Commissioner. No one from the Cabinet Office was available for comment last night.
