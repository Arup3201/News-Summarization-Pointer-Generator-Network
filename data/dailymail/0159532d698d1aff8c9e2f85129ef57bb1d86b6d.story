A star college footballer has been suspended by his college team, the Oklahoma Sooners, after allegedly punching his date so hard that he broke several bones in her face.

Freshman running back, Joe Mixon, 18, seen as the one of the hottest properties in the country, is accused of knocking a woman unconscious with one devastating punch last month.

The alleged victim, who suffered a fractured jaw, broken cheekbone, fractured sinus and fractured orbit, claims the argument started after Mixon directed a homophobic comment towards her male friend.

Joe Mixon, who has pleaded not guilty to assault, has been suspended by the Oklahoma Sooners for one year

CCTV footage of the incident is said to show the woman pushing Mixon. The star footballer, who is 6ft1 and weighs more than 200lbs, reacts by lunging towards her.

According to a probable cause affidavit released by the Cleveland County District Attorney's office, the alleged victim then slaps Mixon in the face - to which he reacts by punching her in the face - causing her to fall into a table before hitting the ground.

Mixon's defence lawyer, Kevin Finlay, said: 'As we have maintained from the beginning, it is our belief that Joe reacted instinctively after being racially slurred and physically assaulted by a highly intoxicated young woman and her male friend.

'We strongly disagree with the series of events as portrayed by Norman PD. Justice knows no gender bias, and we do not believe that Joe's actions were criminal in nature.'

Mixon's lawyers claim their client only acted 'instinctively' after being provoked by racist slurs and physical abuse by a woman and her male friend who they say were very drunk

The year-long suspension means he will miss the whole of his first season at a team with national championship aspirations, being ranked number four in the country. 

The school has since released a statement saying university President David Boren accepted the recommendation of athletic director Joe Castiglione and coach Bob Stoops to suspend Mixon.

Posted on Twitter, it read: 'He will be excluded from all team activities and removed from the team roster. As the university has demonstrated in the past, we are committed to winning the right way. 

Mixon will be allowed to continue studying at the university and will remain eligible for financial aid

'As an example to others, OU sets the highest possible standards for its student athletes, coaches and staff.'

They added that Mixon would be allowed to continue studying at the university and will remain eligible for financial aid. The freshman has pleaded not guilty to assault.
