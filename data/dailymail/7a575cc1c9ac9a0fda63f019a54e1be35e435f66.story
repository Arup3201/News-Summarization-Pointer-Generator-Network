Police have issued a grovelling apology after they posted a Tweet with the words 'Officers 1 Immigrants 0' which was branded xenophobic and racist.

Surrey Police were left red faced after they wrote the Tweet along with the hashtag 'We Will Catch Up With You' following an operation against illegal immigrants resulted in several people being detained.

However within minutes of the posting, at 9.30pm on Thursday night, dozens of people had replied to the Guildford Beat police site, accusing them of being over the top.

Offensive: The tweet was posted after a successful operation which saw several people detained

The original Tweet described how officers along with members of the UK Border Agency had carried out a raids at a mobile carwash in Sainsbury's in Burpham near Guildford, which resulted in eight people being detained.

One user called Dan Maguire wrote: 'Just seen the @Guildford Beat tweet. They shouldn't be allowed on the streets let alone Twitter if that is the attitude they have.'

Another user, Tim Travers wrote '@Guildford Beat institutional racism or institutional stupidity?'

The Tweet was eventually removed as Surrey police posted a series of apologies which read: 'The language used in that tweet was inappropriate and has been removed. Apologies for any offence caused.'

Another person who complained received a differently worded response which read: 'Apologies for any offence caused - wasn't the intention. Message used inappropriate language and has been removed.'

In the joint operation at the Hands On Car Wash at Sainsbury's, workers from Uganda were questioned as to whether they had the right to work in the UK.

Three men, aged between 32 and 37, and a 37-year-old woman were found to have overstayed their visas. Two men, aged 31 and 33, were working in breach of their visa conditions and a 31-year-old had entered the country illegally.

Climbdown: Officers in charge of the force's Twitter feed apologised individually to those who took offence

A 45-year-old man was found to be an immigration offender.

They were arrested and transferred to immigration detention pending removal from the country, apart from the men aged 32 and 33 who were placed on immigration bail while their cases are progressed.

They will face removal from the country if found to have no leave to remain. The 45-year-old is still being questioned by immigration officers.

Hands On Car Wash was served a notice warning that a civil penalty of up to £10,000 per illegal worker found will be imposed unless proof is provided that the correct right-to-work checks were carried out. This is a potential total fine of £80,000.

Discipline: A spokesperson for Surrey Police said the officer who posted the tweet has been given 'advice'

A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'Following a UK Border Agency led operation, supported by Surrey Police, in Guildford, the @GuildfordBeat Twitter account gave an update about the incident to members of the public.

'The language used in a subsequent tweet was inappropriate, it was quickly removed and an apology issued.

'Surrey Police will not tolerate language which is derogatory or discriminatory and the officer who sent the tweet has been given words of advice.

'It is important to stress that whilst the intention was to update the public about a successful intelligence-led operation the wording used does not reflect the views and values of Surrey Police.'
