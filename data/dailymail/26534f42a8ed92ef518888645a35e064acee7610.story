Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong seemed to be struggling with his maths on Tuesday night. The 23-year-old asked on Twitter: ‘If Arsenal win 2-0 they go through?’ No, afraid not, Emmanuel.

Arsenal officially had 1,200 fans in the Stade Louis II — but an estimated 5,000 were in the 18,000 crowd with Monaco having put the tickets on general sale. 

Despite their renaissance, the Principality, with a population of 38,000, unsurprisingly struggles to fill the stadium, even on big European nights. 

Five thousand Arsenal supporters packed in to the Stade Louis II for their tie against Monaco on Tuesday 

It perhaps should come as no surprise that a tax haven inhabited by the super rich should lack passion — but it was difficult to avoid the comparison with the ferocious atmosphere of Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon Stadium, the other venue hosting a Champions League fixture on Tuesday night. Monaco’s Stade Louis II stadium had all the intensity of a yacht club soiree.

This was Arsene Wenger’s first win as a manager against Monaco. He had previously drawn four and lost three.

Despite Bono, Larry Mullen and the Edge all of U2 fame, watching the game from the stands, Wenger and his side still couldn’t find what they were looking for in Europe
