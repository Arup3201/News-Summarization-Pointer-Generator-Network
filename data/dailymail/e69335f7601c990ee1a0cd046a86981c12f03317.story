Sophie Wessex was at London College of Fashion to try her hand at working a sewing machine this afternoon - for the second time in seven days.

Last week saw the Countess put the finishing touches to a charity quilt during a reception for a group of Girl Guides at Buckingham Palace.

And the royal put her new found skills to good use as she tried out various techniques on an industrial machine during a sewing session.

Sophie Wessex was at London College of Fashion trying her dab hand at sewing today 

She was joined by fashion students at the Lime Grove Campus as she helped make an eclectic structured top form a patchwork of fabrics.

The Countess, 49, was appointed the first ever patron of the world famous fashion school 19 months ago. 

Her role was announced on 18th March 2013 and she has since been lending her support to the College's Better Lives campaign.

It aims to use fashion to change the world, reduce the industry's environmental footprint and help those in need.

The London College of Fashion has produced of a roll call of famous alumni, including footwear designers Jimmy Choo and Beatrix Ong, rising star William Tempest, and Harold Tillman chairman of the British Fashion Council.

The Countess' three-year stint as patron involves finding time to visit Better Lives projects, such as one that works with prisons to help rehabilitate female offenders and get them into work on their release.

Speaking at the time of Sophie's appointment, Professor Frances Corner, head of the London College of Fashion, said that the college was 'proud' to have her as patron.

'We are very proud to have The Countess of Wessex's support and look forward to working with her,' she said.

'This is a very exciting time for the college and HRH's Patronage strengthens the innovative work that we do and the contribution we will continue to make to the future of the fashion industry.'

Although the Countess hasn't always been known for her fashion sense, the last few years have seen a sea-change in the first lady of Wessex' personal style.

Gone are the frumpy jackets and oversized hats that characterised the first few years of her married life, while in their place are chic shift dresses, nude courts and flattering hats.

Her role was announced 19 months ago and she's since been lending her support to the College's campaigns
