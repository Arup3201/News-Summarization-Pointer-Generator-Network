Danny Murphy thinks Liverpool's treatment of Steven Gerrard 'stinks' and believes the club were keen to get rid of the 34-year-old.

The Liverpool captain's July move to LA Galaxy was confirmed on Wednesday by coach Bruce Arena in an interview with the LA Times.

But Gerrard revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England.

However, having been one of Liverpool's star performers as Brendan Rodgers' side finished second in the Premier League last season, the midfielder was only offered a new deal in November.

Gerrard's former Anfield team-mate Murphy believes Liverpool always intended to move their skipper on. 

Co-hosting the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast, Murphy said: 'You can only be judged on the season you've just played and, last season, he was terrific. He probably felt he'd warranted a new contract at that point.

'Liverpool let it get to November or December before they offered him anything. In fact, that offer was only triggered by Stevie going out in the press and saying he hadn't been offered a new deal yet. That says to me that the club, and Brendan [Rodgers], were already thinking about him moving on.

'Each manager has his own opinion and Brendan is not going to come out and say, "that was my decision".

'It stinks a bit for me though that they treat a player like that. We saw the same thing with Chelsea and Frank Lampard. Clubs say, "we have offered him a new deal" but it's always on reduced wages.

'It's not how you should treat someone who's put their all into a club.'
