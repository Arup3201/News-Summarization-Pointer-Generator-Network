Louie Jenkins has now taken his first steps on prosthetic legs after his older sister, Francesca (right), tried to teach him how to walk by bribing him with Haribo sweets

A boy of two who had to have both legs amputated after contracting meningitis has taken his first ever steps after being enticed onto his feet - by the offer of Haribo gummy bear sweets.

Louie Jenkins was taken ill early 2012 when he was six months old and had an operation to remove his legs in March last year. The toddler also had to have all the fingers on his left hand amputated and the fingertips on his right hand removed.

His devastated parents thought they would never see their son walk, but when Louie was given prosthetic legs in June 2012 they were given fresh hope when he was given a pair of prosthetic limbs.

Eventually after his big sister Francesca, six, stood at the opposite side of their living room waving a bag of Haribos which include gummy beras, and liquorice Louie shocked his parents Julie, 30, and Warren, 31, when he stood up on his prosthetic legs and walked across the room to help himself.

Now despite setbacks including chicken pox and eczema, little Louie has finally got used to wearing his new limbs and is using the slide and walks hand-in-hand with his parents like any other toddler.

He can now manage over twenty steps at a time before he has to stop for a break.

His mother Julie, a former teaching assistant from Colne, Lancashire said: ‘Doctors told us Louie may never walk, but we always remained positive because even though he was still so young we could already see how much of a determined little boy he was.‘

Louie can now walk 20 steps on his new legs before getting tired

When Louie was given his new legs we 
were quite nervous. We worried that he might not be able to get used to 
them and for a while he was a bit unsure. Francesca has been trying to 
get Louie to walk for ages and like all children Louie loves sweets, so 
Francesca had the idea to hold sweets up to Louie to encourage him to 
walk.

‘I held 
Louie on one side of the room and his dad and sister stood at the 
opposite side of the living room holding Haribo sweets out to Louie.

‘We all watched him stand up and walk over to Francesca. He had such a determined look on his face and when he took his first steps we couldn't believe it. The sweets obviously worked.

‘It was a fantastic moment. It was so emotional for all of us.’

The family set up the Little LAMB (Louie's Amazing Meningitus Battle) appeal to help buy the toddler the equipment needed to support him as he grows. They seek to raise £30,000 for a specialist downstairs wet room and bedroom for Louie.

Julie added: ‘When we were first told Louie would have to have his legs amputated we were heartbroken.

'He was just a baby and for Warren and I to have to see him so ill was devastating.

Louie's mother, Julie, described the moment that he began walking as very emotional

‘Louie was in hospital for a total of eleven weeks and I stayed with him the whole time.

‘My husband Warren works as a welder and fabricator and he had to take care of our daughter, so he would travel from home to Leeds General Infirmary to see us at weekends.

‘The legs Louie has now are his fourth pair because every time he grows he has to get a new pair. It's a bit like when children Louie's age grow out of shoes really quickly.

‘Francesca is so proud of her little brother. She was so excited when he walked for the first time. She couldn't wait to tell everybody at school about it.

‘I go through feeling ecstatic at the fact that he is walking but then often a sadness comes over me because he has spent so long struggling.

‘He has been through so much in his early life. He's truly amazing. Every week he is improving more and more. He is getting more confident and Warren and I have high hopes for him in the future.’
