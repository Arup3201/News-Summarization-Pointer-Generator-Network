A Southern California couple with a shared passion for Disneyland ended 2012 by completing the remarkable achievement of having visited the tourist attraction every single day of last year.

Jeff Reitz and Tonya Mickesh both started last year out of work, but with annual passes to their favorite theme park given to them as a present from a friend.

The couple, who met in July 2006 and don’t have children, decided to visit Disneyland on a daily basis as a way to pass the time while they searched for work, but even after finding jobs they decided to keep up their daily pilgrimage.

Disney nuts! Tonya Mickesh and Jeff Reitz visited Disneyland every day during 2012 after a friend bought them annual passes

‘It was a way to keep ourselves occupied because we didn’t have jobs,’ Mickesh told the Orange County Register. ‘Originally, we thought we’d get jobs and stop doing it, but we kept it going.’

Most days, the couple had a set routine to their visits. They would arrive early in the morning to beat the crowds and park in the Mickey & Friends car park.

Highlights for the couple over the year included spending 24 hours in the park for the 24-hour Leap Day and watching the baby ducks in the park grow up. They also made friendship with the park staff and became known as the ‘everyday Disneyland couple.’

Both Jeff and Tonya are big Disney fans who have been visiting to theme park since they were small children, Jeff was only six months old when his parents first took him.   

In 2012, Mickesh’s favorite attraction was the Pirates of the Caribbean, while for Reitz it was the Matterhorn.

As well as enjoying the rides, the daily trips also provided the couple with plenty of exercise and using a pedometer they worked out that they walked between two and four miles per visit. 

Remarkable achievement: Tonya Mickesh and Jeff Reitz have been made honorary citizens of Disneyland after visiting every day for an entire year

As the year progressed the daily visits became harder to fit into their schedules as the couple found work.

Mickesh’s job started in late April and entailed working the second shift, so they would go in the mornings. Then Reitz found a job in September, making it difficult to go together. So during the week they would go at separate times, leaving the weekends for joint trips.

There were also days when they nearly didn’t make it. One day Reitz got delayed at work and made it to the front gate with only 20 minutes to spare.

Both Mickesh and Reitz say they thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but they have no plans to keep up their daily visits in 2013

The couple’s premium passes cost $649 apiece, include parking, which means that the cost per day per person was $1.77 over the 366 days.

To celebrate their remarkable achievement, the couple were made honorary citizens of Disneyland by Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Tom Staggs in a brief ceremony in front of the castle on New Year's Eve.
