She has made quite a name for herself during her first few weeks on Made in Chelsea thanks to her man-hopping antics, explosive arguments and overused 'catchphrase' 'why is everyone getting up in my grill?'.

But self-confessed 'player' Lucy Watson insists that she isn't as bad as people think and that the show portrays her in the wrong light.

'I'm not as bad as I look on TV, I promise,' she told MailOnline after co-star and former flame Jamie Laing dubbed her a 'b****'.

Setting the record straight: Lucy Watson insists that she is nicer in real life than the way she is portrayed on TV

The pretty brunette who was caught in a love triangle with loveable blonde Jamie and nostril-flaring favourite Andy Jordan enraged viewers when she ditched both men to set her sights on Louise Thompson's boyfriend Spencer Matthews this week.

But while some cast mates haven't warmed to 21-year-old Lucy, newcomer Stevie Johnson has nothing but nice things to say about her.

'She really is a lovely girl,' he said at fellow Made in Chelsea star turned clothes designer Ollie Proudlock's launch night on Wednesday.

Handsome Sam Cussins added: 'Even though she's a good lass she could be a bit high maintenance for me.

'Lucy is more into her bad boy type which me and Stevie don't massively fit into!'

Dumped: Lucy dumped Andy Jordan on Monday night's episode, leaving him to dine alone

Most of the Chelsea cast were out in force to support the launch of Proudlock's Serge DeNimes clothing label and pop-up shop at Wolf and Badger in Mayfair, but Andy Jordan was notably absent.

One surprise guest was I'm a Celebrity Get Me out of Here star Hugo Taylor and his petite girlfriend Natalie Joel.

The pair couldn't keep their hands off each other and whilst the rest of the cast partied in private members club Mortons until the early hours, the smitten couple retired early.

Dolled up: Rosie Fortescue dressed up for the occasion and wore her trademark fedora hat

'Apart from one other clothing label, Serge DeNimes is all I wear. I even wore it in the jungle, I love the new stuff, Ollie has put so much work into it,' Hugo told MailOnline.

Jamie Laing added: 'I love the clothes, my boy Ollie is repping it hard.

'I'm not wearing any because I thought it was too embarrassing to turn up wearing a T-shirt at the Serge launch; I thought that would show a bit too much keenness.

'I have most of the collection, I always steal the T-Shirts from him.'

Stressed: Ollie Proudlock had a stressful day planning the event but was so happy with the turn out

The pint-sized blonde couldn't hide his excitement about moving in with best friend Spencer, even though Spencer's girlfriend Louise made it extremely clear she is unhappy about the decision in Monday's episode.

Jamie said: 'I can't wait for us all to move in together.

'We are still looking for a place. I think we are going to wait until January, that's like our Christmas present to each other, moving in with each other.'

Man of the evening Ollie Proudlock, who was supported by his Serge DeNimes team and his family including mother Lena who Oliver describes as his 'inspiration' and fashion muse, chatted to guests sporting a selection of pieces from his eponymous label.

He said: 'I'm pretty stressed, it was one of those days when everything comes together really late but it's a great turn out, all my friends are here and I love the way the shop looks.'

Designer: The reality TV star has turned his hand to designing and has a pop-up shop in trendy Mayfair (Â£52 each T-shirt)
