A coastguard's isolated cottage boasting incredible sea views is on the market for just £75,000.

Whitenothe Cottage, which overlooks Weymouth Bay in Dorset,  is one of seven dwellings built in 1902 for the Coastguard.

Sitting at the top of 200-metre high cliffs the terraced property has some of the best uninterrupted views in the UK.

A former coastguard's cottage (circled) which is set upon 200-metre cliffs in Dorset will be auctioned off with a guide price of £75,000

However, there is no electricity or mains gas - while water is harvested from rainfall and stored in underground tanks.

It has a log burner and septic tank, with accommodation consisting of two bedrooms, two reception rooms and a bathroom.

Despite the lack of amenities, the cottage was lived in for the past 30 years by a gentleman who passed away last year at the age of 94.

He left the cottage to the National Trust, which has asked Savills to sell in it forthcoming auction.

Described as a 'unique opportunity' to own a home with 'some of the most spectacular views you'll find anywhere in the UK', the property has a guide price of just £75,000.

This is compared to the £410,000 paid at auction for a set of disused toilets in Harrow earlier this month.

Paul Mooney, Savills auctioneer, said: 'It is a real hideaway on the cliffs, overlooking Weymouth and Portland.

'There are spectacular views, it really is unique. I have never auctioned off a property so isolated and you won't find many like it around the country.

The former owner left the cottage to the National Trust, which has asked for the property to be auctioned

The cottage is one of seven built for the coast guard at the turn of the 20th century

'This property provides prospective purchasers with the rare opportunity to be completely at one with nature whilst enjoying some of the most spectacular views you'll find anywhere in the UK.

'Properties such as this are hard to come by as they are rarely for sale in the public domain and it would provide a wonderful opportunity for a second home owner looking for a unique project.

'Nothing like this will ever be built again and so it really is one of the country's last great coastal hideaways.

'If you want to get away from everything and go back to nature and have some of the best views in the country then this is perfect.'
