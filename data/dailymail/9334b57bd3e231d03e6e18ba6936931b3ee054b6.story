A council leader believed to have shot his wife dead before turning the gun on himself is set to be buried alongside her in a funeral at the church where they held their wedding.

Keith Johnson and his wife Andrea are pictured here signing the marriage register in 2004 at St Peter and St Paul Church in Cromer, Norfolk - the place where they will be laid to rest next week.

The victim's parents say they feel 'no animosity' towards their son-in-law even though he is thought to be responsible for their daughter's death.

Police believe the 68-year-old North Norfolk District Council leader killed his 44-year-old wife on December 2 outside their home in Roughton, near Cromer.

Mr Johnson was found with a shotgun by his side and is thought to have made a telephone call to friends before taking his own life.

But despite the circumstances, Mrs Johnson's parents John and Janice Chadwick insisted that the couple should have a joint funeral.

'We have no animosity against Keith or anyone,' Mrs Chadwick said. 'It was a spur of the moment thing.'

A notice was published today in the Eastern Daily Press confirming that the Johnsons would be buried together, with members of both families uniting under one roof.

The notice states that Mr Johnson was the 'dearly-loved son of Joyce and the late Ted', adding that his mother is 'broken-hearted' after his death.

'To honour Andrea's vibrant personality, her family requests that those who attend her funeral wear an article of brightly coloured clothing,' it continues.

'She was a beloved daughter, sister, auntie and nana and will be deeply missed by those she left behind.'

The couple are said to have very popular, and a large crowd of mourners is expected to attend the ceremony.

Investigation: Officials have not yet found a motive for the tragic murder-suicide

Detectives from Norfolk Police are continuing their investigation into the deaths to prepare a file for the coroner.

Police have not released a possible motive for the killing, though friends of the Conservative councillor and former mayor have said he seemed depressed in the days before the tragedy.

Mr Chadwick denied claims that his daughter and son-in-law had a turbulent open relationship, describing their deaths as 'a lovers' tiff that has gone wrong'.

Mr Johnson had four shotguns registered to his home, and is believed to have used one of the weapons to carry out the murder.

The couple had been together for 18 years, though they married only in 2004.
