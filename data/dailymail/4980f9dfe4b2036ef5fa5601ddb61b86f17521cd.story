David Crystal, professor of linguistics of Bangor University, explained how people are dropping letters when typing words into search engines

Common misspellings of English words could be acceptable within a few years because they are used online, a linguist has said.

‘Rhubarb’ could change to ‘rubarb’, ‘receipt’ to ‘receit’ and ‘necessary’ to ‘neccesary’.

Simpler online forms of ‘irritating’ complex words are starting to affect mainstream usage,  linguistics professor David Crystal told the Hay Literary Festival.

He started monitoring the word ‘rhubarb’ ten years ago by typing the correct spelling into a search engine, then the error ‘rubarb’.

He said: ‘I got millions of hits for rhubarb with the “h”, and just one or two without it.’

A few years later, ‘rubarb’ got ‘hundreds of hits, and then a  few years later hundreds of  thousands of hits,’ he said.

‘Rhubarb is still the dominant one by a factor of 50. But think ahead 50 years . . . and rhubarb and rubarb will be equal.’

Professor Crystal, of Bangor University, said the ‘h’ is illogical and was not used in Middle English.

He predicted more changes, saying: ‘Is it one “c” and two “s”s in necessary or two “c”s and  one “s”? . . . Over time one  spelling will emerge, probably a simpler one.

‘The internet will influence spelling. It will get rid of some letters that irritate us, the letters that instinctively we feel shouldn’t be there. But it will take time.’

At the festival, Simon Horobin, a professor of English at Oxford, proposed spellings of ‘they’re’, ‘their’ and ‘there’ be standardised and told ‘grammar police’ to relax over apostrophe usage.

Professor Crystal also criticised Education Secretary Michael Gove and plans to make schools concentrate on teaching the phonics.

He said the move was 'absurd' because the English language was a mix of phonics and words.

A recent study from Cambridge University which was published last month revealed how language is becoming more informal.

The average English child is likely 
to say the word 'like' five times as often as his or her grandparents 
and the word 'love' is used more than six times as often as 'hate'.

The
research was part of the Cambridge English Corpus - one of the biggest 
collections of words in the English language in the world.

The
Corpus contains written and spoken English from books, newspapers, 
advertising, letters, emails, websites, and recordings of conversations,
lectures, TV, meetings, radio and many other sources, totalling several
billion words.

Over 20 years, researchers have formed a database which shows there is a decline in the correct use of grammar.

Claire Dembry, from Cambridge University Press, said people are now embracing the different forms of the English language.
