A Labour MP today likened the American drug giant Pfizer to a 'rapist' for trying to buy its British rival AstraZeneca.

Austin Mitchell said David Cameron was refusing to block Pfizer's £63billion bid because he was scared of offending the US.

Writing on Twitter, he said: 'Cameron dare not stop Pfizer because he dare not offend the US in any way. Roll up rapists.'

Labour MP Austin Mitchell sparked fury after likening US drug giant Pfizer to a 'rapist'. It is not the first time he has caused controversy on Twitter - he previously joked that a female Tory MP should obey her husband

Pfizer chief Ian Read was swamped after leaving the House of Commons yesterday. He was grilled by MPs over his company's proposed takeover of AstraZeneca

Tory Women's Minister Nicky Morgan attacked Mr Mitchell on Twitter for his 'offensive' remark and called on him to 'withdraw your tweet now'.

She wrote to the Labour leader to say the 'comments are totally unacceptable'.

Her letter read: 'Austin Mitchell must withdraw what he has written immediately and issue a full, unreserved apology.

'As the Leader of the Labour Party I look forward to hearing what action you intend to take in response to this totally unacceptable behaviour.'

Outspoken backbencher Nadine Dorries joined a host of MPs in attacking Mr Mitchell's tweet

The new Women's Minister Nicky Morgan was first to attack the Labour MP for his outburst. She said it was time for Labour leader Ed Miliband to suspend him from the party

But an unrepentant Mr Mitchell defended his remarks. He said critics were ‘making a mountain out of a molehill’. He confirmed that he had apologised to Labour chief whip Rosie Winterton over his choice of words, but said he stood by the sentiment of his original tweet.

He added: ‘I have corrected what I said – I should have referred to rapaciousness, but it’s difficult to express what I feel Pfizer will do to AstraZeneca in 140 characters.

‘I do not feel I merit this pile of abuse I am getting for using a word that is regularly used in other contexts – lots of very respectable, well-to-do people regularly talk about the rape of the countryside. I was doing no different. People are making a mountain out of a molehill.’

His remarks came after he tweeted: 'Naughty me. 'Substute (sic) rapaciousness before any more Physer (sic) defenders weigh in.'

A Labour spokesman confirmed Mr Mitchell had apologised to Labour chief whip Rosie Winterton.

'The
 chief whip has made clear to Austin Mitchell this tweet was 
unacceptable. He has now apologised for what was an obvious error of 
judgment.'

The veteran Labour MP, who is standing down at the next election, appeared less than wholly repentant in a second tweet posted after his 'rapists' outburst

It is not the first time Mr Mitchell 
has sparked anger on Twitter. In 2012 he became embroiled in a sexism 
storm after telling the former Tory MP Louise Mensch to obey her 
husband.

Mr Mitchell said Mrs Mensch had been caught lying about why she quit Parliament after her husband claimed she resigned to avoid being 'killed' at the next election.

She had insisted she only resigned to be with her rock star manager husband Peter Mensch, who lives in the US.

But Mr Mitchell, who changed his name to Austin Haddock in 2002 to raise awareness of Britain's fishing industry, tweeted: 'Shut up Menschkin. A good wife doesn’t disagree with her master in public and a good little girl doesn’t lie about why she quit politics.'

David Cameron, speaking here during Prime Minister's Questions in Commons today, was challenged over his refusal to block Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca

He later revealed that he had been told to withdraw the message by his wife and his three daughters.

Mr Mitchell's latest Twitter outburst came after a fiery Prime Minister's Questions dominated by the Pfizer takeover bid.

Mr Miliband challenged Mr Cameron's 'failure' to protect British jobs and urged him to block it if it was not good for Britain.

He said the Prime Minister could offer no reassurances for British jobs, science or investment in the wake of a takeover.

But Mr Cameron said, in the final Prime Minister's Questions clash before prorogation, that his Government was getting 'stuck in' to get the best deal for Britain rather than standing on the sidelines opposing a deal outright.

Labour party leader Ed Miliband challenged David Cameron to apply a public interest test to the Pfizer bid and dismissed the proposed job guarantees offered to the Prime Minister as 'worthless'

Mr Cameron said 'the right thing to do is to get stuck in to seek the best possible guarantees on British jobs, on British investment, and British science'.

The PM also accused Mr Miliband of 'putting party politics ahead of the national interest'.

He said: 'We discussed this last week and one of the most important things we have learned since last week is you were asked for a meeting with Pfizer - but you said you were too busy political campaigning.'

Mr Miliband hit back - claiming he was 'not going to take any lectures' from the Prime Minister. He accused Mr Cameron of 'negotiating with Pfizer over the heads of the board of AstraZeneca'.

He added: 'Pfizer doesn't need a PR man, they have the Prime Minister.'

Mr Cameron insisted he was not biased in favour of the Pfizer bid. He said he was simply 'getting stuck in' to win guarantees over British jobs.

He said: 'I am clear what the British interest is - it is British jobs, British science, British R&D, and we will do everything we can to make those guarantees we have received, and you would have got nothing, as firm as possible.'

Mr Miliband warned that the PM's assurances were 'useless'.

He demanded to know if he had challenged Pfizer's boss Ian Read over his revelation to MPs that 'there will be job cuts somewhere'.

The Labour leader asked Mr Cameron: 'Have you got an assurance these job cuts won't take place in the UK?'

Mr Cameron replied: 'We have assurances on the percentage of R&D that will happen here, on investment in Cambridge, on investment in Macclesfield. If you are arguing, "do we want further assurances?", yes we do.

'Do we want to make sure those jobs stay here? Yes we do. Do we want more investment in British universities and British science? Yes we do.

'The only difference between us is how do you get those things. I say get stuck in, negotiate hard, fight for Britain. You say stand up, play politics and put that before the national interest.'

The exchange came after the Tory Science Minister David Willetts this morning suggested that the Government would like Pfizer to go further in its guarantees to protect British jobs.

Asked whether Pfizer's five-year commitment to protect research jobs was enough, Mr Willetts told MP on the Commons Science Select Committtee: 'I would like to see a longer period than that.'
