The ‘People’s Open’ was Thomas Bjorn’s evocative description to sum up the raucous atmosphere that pervaded at Royal Liverpool in 2006. Now, on The Open’s return next week, one of the people has qualified to play.

Nothing sums up the unique spot the tournament holds in our glorious summer of sport than the feelgood story of John Singleton. The 30-year-old makes his living driving a forklift truck in a resin factory some 10 minutes from Hoylake.

At 4.30pm, he clocks off and makes his way down to Eastham Lodge golf club to practise. His dreams of making it as a pro have gone but there’s no trace of bitterness. ‘I was lucky to get the job I’ve got and I’m happy with what I’m doing,’ he said.

Scouse proud: Local man John Singleton defied the odds to qualify for the 2014 Open

It was pregnant fiancee Lucy who persuaded him to try to qualify for The Open, with it being on the doorstep and all. Poor John took one look at the dilapidated state of his two wedges and decided there was no point turning up for qualifying at Hillside with them. So he borrowed a couple off his mate.

At Hillside that blessed day there were 72 players chasing three spots. There was Matt Fitzpatrick, the gilded teenager who has just turned pro. Established European Tour men like Graeme Storm and Richard Finch. Young amateurs who do nothing else but play golf; hardened pros who make a living winning regional PGA events.

Who shot the lowest score of the afternoon play? John Singleton. Who came through a nerve-wracking play-off following the scheduled 36 holes to earn his spot alongside Tiger, Rory and the rest? The  factory man.

As he was driving to work last  Friday, Singleton spotted the mate who had lent him the two wedges. ‘We just looked at each other and burst out laughing at the craziness of it all,’ he said. ‘It’s every golfer’s dream to play in The Open and now it’s happening to me on my doorstep. It’s a bit overwhelming to be honest.’

To help get over the shock and awe, Singleton took a look around the course last week. At the magnificent wraparound grandstand at the 18th that is going to give this Open a carnival flavour. ‘I don’t think it’s going to hit me until I see the people in the stands,’ he said. ‘It’s just a dream come true.’

Loan star: John Singleton, 30, qualified for the tournament using a borrowed set of clubs

Singleton’s love of the game is such he 
was due to have been a  volunteer marshall next week. Instead his job 
inside the ropes will be the most glamorous one of all.

No doubt the winner will come from the upper echelons of the game, just as it did back in 2006 when Tiger won. But it’s the John Singletons who make the event unlike any other major sporting occasion.

The men who return to their day jobs but who can always say that for one week at least they rubbed shoulders with giants and played in The Open.

Can I suggest those in charge of the qualifying criteria for the Ricoh Women’s British Open, which takes place at Royal Birkdale this week, have a rethink? Stephanie Meadow finished third on her pro debut at the US Open last month.

Unfair: Stephani Meadows was forced to qualify for the British Open despite recent third place finishes

The brilliant 21-year-old from Northern Ireland followed that up by shooting a final-round 63 to finish third again in the Ladies European Tour’s flagship event on Sunday.

One of those performances should have earned her an exemption. An equivalent performance certainly would have done so in the men’s game. Instead, she had to endure the rigours of qualifying yesterday. That’s just not right.

Soothsayer: Graeme McDowell's prediction saw him win a second Alstrom Open de France

‘What I need to do is shoot a 66 or 67 in the final round, because there’s a 76 lying in wait for any man out there.’

That was how Graeme McDowell called it on Saturday evening, after falling eight behind American Kevin Stadler at the French Open. The following day he shot 67 to Stadler’s 76 to not only defend his title successfully but display an enviable line in prophecy.

Outside the usual summer staples, the highlights next year must be an Open at St Andrews and an Ashes Test match at Lord’s. And, to the considerable annoyance of the many who would like to watch both, they will clash.

Clash: The 2016 Open at St Andrews will played at the same time as the Ashes Test match at Lord's

This will be the third time since 2009 this has happened but a clash with a St Andrews Open is particularly grievous.

Who’s to blame?  Certainly not the Royal and Ancient, who announce the Open dates years in advance. I’m told Sky television, who hold the cricket rights, are culpable.

Sky do so many good things when it comes to golf that it’s a shame they let themselves down with this harmful act towards the biggest event of all.
