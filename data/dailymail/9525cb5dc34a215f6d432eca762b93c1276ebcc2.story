One in four patients says their doctors talk over them as if they weren’t there, according to a major survey.

A fifth didn’t necessarily trust the doctor treating them while a third couldn’t always understand what they were being told.

One in ten said there weren’t enough nurses and one in five was not always treated with dignity.

One in four patients said doctors talk over them as if they aren't there, according to a new NHS survey

The results of the NHS’s annual survey of hospital patients showed care had improved compared to last year.

But campaigners were still disappointed in the findings, considering the efforts made to drive up standards.

More than 64,500 patients who had spent at least one night in hospital took part in the survey, which covered various aspects of their care.

The results show that 24 per cent felt doctors sometimes talked over them as if they didn’t exist. Twenty per cent didn’t always have trust and confidence in them and 33 per cent didn’t always understand the answers to their questions. Another 13 per cent of patients thought hospital food was poor while 21 per cent said they weren’t always offered enough choice of meals.

Almost one in ten was put in a mixed-sex ward when they were first admitted and 14 per cent were made to share bathrooms or toilets with the opposite sex.

One in five was not always treated with respect and dignity and 5 per cent had a poor overall experience of care.

Although the survey found patient care had improved overall, campaigners said the survey findings were still disappointing

Michelle Mitchell, director of charity Age UK, said: ‘Whilst it is encouraging that there have been small improvements on in-patient relationships with nurses and doctors and that most patients felt they were treated with  dignity and respect, it is deeply disappointing that there has been no significant improvement  since 2011.

Do you understand what your doctor tells you?

‘Dignity needs to be a priority for all those responsible for  delivering care and should be a fundamental staple in every  care setting.

‘Patients need to be involved more, asked what they think of the quality of care and if there is a problem then people must know how to complain.

‘To have an NHS that is truly patient-centred and committed to providing dignified care, there needs to be a real change in the caring relationship.’

But Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer for NHS England, the new body in charge of hospitals and GP services, said the findings were broadly positive.

‘The NHS must get it right every time for every patient. This survey is, on the whole, encouraging and demonstrates progress in key areas.

‘However, there remains too much variation in the quality of care provided and hospitals need to look closely at what they need to do to improve.’
