A billionaire family from Oklahoma is offering a 217-acre campus for free to a Christian institution.

Worth more than $20million, the campus in Northfield, Massachusetts will be offered to an institution that promises to offer an education founded on traditional Christian beliefs.

It must also be able to show it has the funds to maintain the sprawling, classic New England campus.

The campus was once home to the Northfield Mount Hermon prep school, founded as a girls’ school by famed evangelist D.L. Moody.

It now belongs to the Green family, who own the Oklahoma-based Hobby Lobby craft store chain.

They bought in in 2009 for $100,000, with the intention of giving it to a new college named after Christian scholar C.S. Lewis.

However that project stalled amid fundraising woes, prompting the Greens to search for another owner.

Since the market to resell the campus does not currently exist, Hobby Lobby president Steve Green said the family has decided to offer the campus and its 43 buildings to a select institution that can meet its criteria.

Following $5million of renovations, the campus is now ready to be occupied, but it is expensive to keep it in this condition.

Mr Green said the family would like to transfer the grounds to a new owner at least by the end of the year.

The Greens invited 15 top Christian institutions to view the campus, 11 of which have now visited. Another nine have been allowed to inspect the grounds as news of the offer has spread, and more requests are coming in daily.

Some Northfield Mount Hermon alumni are protesting against Liberty's interest in the campus, citing what they call the 'divisive and hateful' views of its founder

So far, Olivet, Azusa Pacific University and Liberty University are among the schools whose names have gone public.

There is concern about how a conservative Christian institution will mesh in a town of about 3,000 in a notably liberal state.

‘We hope that whatever's here can bring people together and not divide,’ said Alexander Stewart, chair of a town committee monitoring the sale.

Mr Green added that the priority is to find the right tenant, restoring Moody’s original intent to create a place to teach and train people to share Biblical truth.

Even while the campus remains vacant, Moody’s legacy lives on, with busloads of Christians from South Korea - where Moody’s ministry had a deep impact - still climbing to join hands and pray around Moody’s hilltop grave.

‘We would love to see the property be used for a great Christian ministry, and if we help somebody to get that started without a lot of heartburn ... and be a light in the area, that would be our primary goal,’ Mr Green said.

Liberty's interest has prompted some Northfield Mount Hermon alumni to petition the school's board of trustees to protest any sale to the university, citing what they called the ‘divisive and hateful’ views of its founder, the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. Residents have also met to discuss concerns about Virginia-based Liberty and the fate of the campus.

But Northfield Mount Hermon has no say over what the Greens decide to do with the property, and Liberty is not likely a top contender, anyway. To make the transaction as simple as possible, the family prefers to give the campus to someone who will take it all, and Liberty has discussed assuming control of only a portion of it.

Mr Green added such protests would matter ‘very little’ to the family if it felt it had found a good suitor who would also be a good neighbour. ‘You'll never please everybody and we understand that,’ he said.
