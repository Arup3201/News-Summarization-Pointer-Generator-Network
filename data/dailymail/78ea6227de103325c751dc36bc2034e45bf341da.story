The son of Ariel Castro, the prime suspect in the abduction of three Cleveland girls, interviewed the mother of one of the missing girls for a local news piece, with no idea she was being held captive at his father's house.

Anthony Castro, 31, said he was absolutely stunned when he heard about what his father has been accused of, after Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, Michele Knight and Amanda's six-year-old daughter were rescued from his home.

After the disappearance of Gina DeJesus in April 2004, Anthony Castro penned a piece for his local paper which includded quotes from her mother.

He was a journalism student at Bowling 
Green State University when he wrote the article, entitled 'Gina 
DeJesus’ disappearance has changed her neighborhood', for the Plain 
Press in June of that year.

Gina's mother Nancy Ruiz told him: 'You can tell the difference. People are watching out for each other’s kids. It’s a shame 
that a tragedy had to happen for me to really know my neighbors.

'Bless their hearts, they’ve been great. People are really looking out for my daughter.'

Ariel 'Anthony' Castro read out a statement in court in defense of his sister and her mental illness, saying: 'What happened to Janyla was serious, unthinkable and irreversible. What happened to my sister is no less serious'

Prison: Castro has lived in the house since 1992. His two brothers - aged 50 and 54 - do not live there but have been arrested in connection with the girls' disappearance

The aspiring journalist described the atmosphere of the area after the incident.

'Since April 2, 2004 , the day 
14-year-old Gina DeJesus was last seen on her way home from Wilbur 
Wright Middle School, neighborhood residents have been taken by an 
overwhelming need for caution.

'Parents are more strictly enforcing curfews, encouraging their children to walk in groups, or driving them to and from school when they had previously walked alone.

'On Cleveland’s west side, it is difficult to go any length of time without seeing Gina’s picture on telephone poles, in windows, or on cars along the busy streets. 

'One thing is for certain, however. Almost everyone feels a connection with the family, and Gina’s disappearance has the whole area talking.' 

He also mentioned Amanda Berry in his article, saying: 'They feel the disappearance of Amanda Berry on April 21, 2003, was a wake-up call, but Gina’s case really caught everyone’s attention.'

Anthony had no idea the answer to her whereabouts, and that of two other local girls, lay in his father's house, which he said he was never allowed inside.

Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'I 
last saw my dad two weeks ago, it was at the house, but he didn't let me
 in.

'He never did. I was never invited inside. The last time was several
 years ago and even then it was for about 20 minutes.

'If
 I had known anything about this, there is no way I could have not done 
something about it. I wrote about it ten years ago and now it is so 
close to my family. It's unbelievable.

'I can express nothing but shame for our
 family. It is just beyond anything that we can speak about. It’s just a
 nightmare. I feel unspeakably horrible for the victims.'

Other case: Gina DeJesus went missing in 2004 on
 her way home from school and her alleged kidnapper's son actually wrote an article about her disappearance for the local paper

It also emerged today that Anthony's sister Emily was jailed for 25 years in 2008 for the attempted murder of her 11-month-old baby.

Emily Castro, 24, tried to slash her daughter Janyla's throat in April 2007 after she broke up with the child's father.

Court documents state that police were called to Emily's home in Fort Wayne, Indiana - where she moved after she became pregnant - when a passerby saw a woman running out to the street with a bleeding baby in her arms.

The woman was Emily's mother, Grimilda Figeroa, who told police that her daughter stabbed her own child.

When officers went to the home, they found Emily Castro covered in mud, water and blood.

She was bleeding from self-inflicted knife wounds to her neck and wrists and told police she tried to kill herself with the same knife she used to attack her baby. She then tried to drown herself in a nearby creek.

At the time, she had a long history of mental illness though was found competent to stand trial as it did not meet the legal definition of insanity.

During the trial, her defense attorneys produced evidence that Castro suffered from serious depression for years before the birth of her daughter, and that it spiraled into paranoia, causing her to think her family was trying to kill her and the baby at the time of the attack.

The Journal Gazette reported at the time of the trial that Emily told the judge she was a good mom and that she did not know how it could have happened.

Court: Emily Castro, then 19, is pictured going to her initial hearing charged with attempted murder and felony battery for cutting her 10-month-old daughter's neck several times in 2008

Alleged abductor: Ariel Castro's daughter Emily - who is believed to be pictured here with her father - was jailed for 25 years in 2008 for trying to murder her daughter

Her brother Anthony read out a statement in court in defense of his sister and her mental illness.

He said: 'What happened to Janyla was serious, unthinkable and irreversible. What happened to my sister is no less serious.

'Emily's mental illness was 
something the family saw every day, and it was regrettable it failed to 
meet the legal definition of insanity.'

She was not an 'animal who tried to 
kill her daughter out of revenge', he said, describing his sister as a 
proud mother who put together scrapbooks in anticipation of Janyla’s 
first birthday.

The child made a full recovery, though it is not known whose custody she is currently in.

Family: Anthony Castro with his late mother Grimilda Figeroa - who was in the Indiana home with Emily Castro when she tried to murder her daughter

Emily and Anthony's father Ariel 
Castro, 52, was arrested on Monday after one of his alleged victims 
escaped his home and called police.

Neighbors
 in the street were shocked to hear that Castro, who was a school bus 
driver in the Cleveland area until last year, could be capable of 
abducting three innocent teenagers from the street and tying them up 
with chains in his basement.

Castro's Facebook page depicts a man with a passion for motorcycles and the bass guitar.

His last post to the social networking site on May 2 says: 'Miracles really do happen, God is good :)'

The
 man who came to Amanda Berry's rescue, Charles Ramsey, expressed 
disbelief that his neighbor could be capable of such a disturbed and 
shocking crime.

He told 
NewsNet5: 'I've been here a year. I barbeque with this dude, we eat ribs
 and what not and listen to salsa music. Not a clue that that girl was 
in that house or that anyone else was in there with.

'He just comes out to his backyard, plays with the dogs, tinkering with his cars and motorcycles and goes back in the house.

'He's
 somebody you look and then you look away because he's just doing normal
 stuff. You got some big testicles to pull this one off because we see 
this guy every day.'

Sources
 close to local station WOIO said the women were reportedly tied up 
during their captivity and police found chains hanging from one of the 
ceilings

They also 
reported there were signs that dirt had recently been moved in the 
backyard of the house, though police continue to investigate whether or 
not the dirt will lead to any new evidence in the case.

Castro has lived in the house since 
1992. His two brothers - Pedro, 54, and Oneil, 50 - do not live at the
 home but were arrested in connection with the three abductions.

Records
 show that Castro was arrested for domestic violence and disorderly 
conduct in December, 1993, though details of this are not yet available.

He was also stopped six times by Cleveland Police between 1995 and 2008 for traffic violations.

In a press conference today, it was 
revealed that police were called to the house in January 2004, after 
Castro left a child on his bus at the depot. They were not able to get anyone at the home and 
police did not follow up on it.

After an investigation, no criminal intent was found.

There are no other records of any violations or complaints in relation to the address.

He was a school bus driver in the 
area until November 2012, when he was let go after doing an illegal 
U-turn with children on the bus, according to the Cleveland Leader.
