Ferguson's municipal court judge resigned Monday following a scathing report from the U.S. Department of Justice that was prompted by the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. 

Ronald J. Brockmeyer stepped down to help the city 'begin its healing process' and to promote public confidence in the court, he said through a spokesman. 

State appeals Judge Roy L. Richter was appointed by the Missouri Supreme Court to take his place and make 'needed reforms' in all of Ferguson's pending and future municipal court cases.

Richter will be authorized to overhaul court policies in order to 'restore the integrity of the system' and ensure the respect of defendants' rights, according to the high court.  

He will start on March 16. 

Chief Justice Mary Russell said she believes Richter will bring a 'fresh, disinterested perspective' to the court. 

'He is able and willing to implement needed reforms,' she said. 'Extraordinary action is warranted in Ferguson, but the Court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis.'  

Last Thursday two Ferguson Police Department commanders resigned after racist emails were released during the DOJ's investigation into the police department.  

Sgt. William Mudd and Capt. Rick Henke resigned Thursday and City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty was fired Wednesday.

A Justice Department investigation found patterns of racial bias in the Ferguson police department and at the municipal jail and court. Brockmeyer stepped down to help the city 'begin its healing process', he said 

It is unclear whether the three were recipients or senders of the 'racially biased' emails included in the 102-page civil rights report.  

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Henke was associated with a 2008 email suggesting that President Barack Obama would not complete a full presidential term because a black man can't hold 'a steady job for four years'. 

Mudd is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a New Orleans woman was paid by 'CrimeStoppers' to terminate her pregnancy. 

The Justice Department highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless, appearingly tribal, women dancing, with the caption 'Michelle Obama's High School Reunion.'

The report states that the emails illustrate racial, ethnic, or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the DOJ's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week.

In fact, the report states, there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails. 

Instead, the emails were forwarded along to others.

The investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts. 

The report also adds that evidence found shows not only racial bias, 'but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case.'  

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the DOJ's report 'searing,' saying the investigation found the Ferguson community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be 'disproportionately harmful to African-American residents.' 

'This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized,' Holder said. 'A community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents. 

'A community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue.'

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said Friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the DOJ, Reuters reports.  

The DOJ's civil rights investigation into the St. Louis suburb of 21,000 came after a white Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson (right) fatally shot an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown (left) on Aug. 9

The grand jury's decision not to indict the Ferguson police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast Ferguson's mostly white police force in a negative light

Knowles did not comment on whether Police Chief Tom Jackson would step down, Reuters reports, amid calls for the chief to do so by some community and civil rights leaders.  

The report highlighted the department's practices, saying the city's focus on revenue greatly impacts the police department's approach to law enforcement and the role of Ferguson's municipal court. 

It states: 'The Ferguson Municipal Court handles most charges brought by the FPD, and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice, or protecting the rights of the accused, but of maximizing revenue.'

The department also exhibited evidence of racial stereotyping, the report states.

The report found that some practices of the Ferguson Police Department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the Fourth Amendment

The report highlighted the fact that African-Americans make 'extraordinary' efforts to pay off overly expensive tickets for often minor,  unfairly charged violations.

Court records and emails show that while African-Americans struggled to pay the expensive tickets, city officials including the Municipal Judge, the court clerk, and department supervisors helped their friends, colleagues, and even themselves in eliminating tickets, fees, fines, and citations.

The report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help.

The clerk responded: 'Your ticket of $200 has magically disappeared! 

The report found that some practices of the Ferguson Police Department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause.
