The battle for mortgage customers has taken a new turn – with one bank launching a six-year fixed rate deal.

A string of major lenders have slashed their interest rates and fees in recent days in an apparent end-of-year sale to meet targets.

The tussle for business has seen several lenders drop their rates below 3 per cent for people looking for a five-year fixed rate mortgage.

Now, Virgin Money has launched a fixed rate six-year deal starting from 2.99 per cent – the same rate as some of its equivalent five-year products.

The bank said that, while seven and ten-year deals are already on the market, the six-year deal offers a ‘middle ground’ to house buyers who are scared of locking in for longer.

Experts said it is ‘great news’ for consumers as many rush to sign up to fixed rate deals before the Bank of England raises its base rate, pushing up mortgage repayments. Industry figures said banks are driving down prices at the moment in a desperate bid to attract more buyers to hit their end-of-year targets.

A rising number of new lenders has helped to increase competition and push down rates. There has also been an ‘improved appetite’ among banks to lend now that they have got to grips with tougher lending rules

A rising number of new lenders has helped to increase competition and push down rates. There has also been an ‘improved appetite’ among banks to lend now that they have got to grips with tougher lending rules introduced in April, it was claimed.

The market saw some disruption earlier this year as lenders adjusted to stricter rules which required them to carry out extra checks on borrowers’ spending habits to ensure they could afford repayments if interest rates rose. The number of mortgage approvals dipped around that time before heading back upwards.

David Hollingworth, head of communications at London and Country Mortgages, said: ‘Lenders have let these processes bed in before rolling their sleeves up to get some business back in. This is not just window dressing, lenders are looking to do business.’

Banks put up interest rates over the summer amid fears of an imminent hike of the base rate rise, but they have since fallen back below 5 per cent for five-year fixed rates for the first time in three months. In mid-July, the best rate on a fixed rate five-year deal was 3.09 per cent from Metro, while many banks are now offering well below 3 per cent.
