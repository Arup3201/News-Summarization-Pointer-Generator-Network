A popular New York salon will soon start offering a 'Vagina Facial' for women who want a little extra grooming...down there.

J. Sisters, which is best known for introducing the Brazilian bikini wax to New York City, will launch the new service in its Midtown Manhattan salon later this week, according to the New York Post.

The facial will use gommage therapy, a gentle kind of exfoliation, to combat cosmetic imperfections such as ingrown hairs.

New service: New York's J. Sisters salon will soon offer a 'Vagina Facial' for women who want their bikini area to appear well-groomed like the one pictured

Gommage, which means 'to erase' in French, is a type of cream or paste that is typically applied to the face or body in a thin layer and later removed by massaging away.

And that's not the only new treatment that the salon is adding; a service called J. Sisters Couture will offer 'color and shaping' for the nether regions of older women who are going grey.

The J. Sisters isn't the first New York salon to offer treatments to beautify one's lady parts.

Ms Paltrow famously once proclaimed that the salon 'changed her life'.
