Aaron Murphy scored two tries as Huddersfield ended their hoodoo against bogey side Warrington but it was Danny Brough who starred in the Giants' win.

Brough provided the assist for both of Murphy's tries in a typically influential display and the talismanic stand-off also landed four conversions and a drop goal.

Jamie Ellis, Jermaine McGillvary and Eorl Crabtree also crossed the whitewash for Huddersfield, who ended a run of 11 games without victory against Wolves going back to 2011.

The hosts welcomed back skipper Joel Monaghan from a two-match injury absence but Ben Harrison, Richie Myler, Gary Wheeler and brothers Ben and Rhys Evans were missing.

Huddersfield brought back Anthony Mullally for Josh Johnson but were still without Chris Bailey, who missed the victory at Wakefield for family reasons.

The Giants, whose confidence was boosted by three successive victories against Widnes, Castleford and Wakefield after three opening defeats, made a dream start with a try from Ellis.

The scrum-half won the race to his own neat grubber kick to score under the posts after six minutes and Brough landed the conversion.

Warrington missed a chance when Ben Currie lost the ball after Ryan Atkins had been held up over the line.

The Wolves increased the pressure but their own mistakes, a poor kicking game and dogged Giants defence kept Warrington at bay.

Ben Westwood lost the ball trying to stretch over the line with Atkins then bundled into touch on the first tackle.

Warrington prop Chris Hill and Giants second row Jack Hughes were involved in a skirmish before Huddersfield increased their lead with a trademark Brough drop goal just before the interval.

Wolves were fortunate to be only 7-0 down at the break after a mistake littered first half.

The lead was increased soon after the restart when Brough's kick bounced awkwardly for Stefan Ratchford and Murphy pounced to race over for a converted try and stretch the advantage to 13-0.

Warrington finally broke the resolute Giants defence after 47 minutes when Chris Bridge, after a poor first half, broke through to send in Gareth O'Brien with an inside pass.

O'Brien converted his own try and Mickey Higham almost forced his way over after Westwood was held short.

Warrington briefly stepped up the tempo with a sizzling break from his own line by Ratchford setting up the chance for Monaghan to put Kevin Penny over in the corner and close the gap to 13-10 after 63 minutes.

Brough was a constant threat to Warrington and another precision kick to the corner split the Wolves defence for Murphy to pounce for his second try and make it 17-10 with 13 minutes left.

A touchline burst by McGillvary almost brought another try but his cross field kick just eluded Craig Kopczak.

Huddersfield sealed victory five minutes from time when McGillvary intercepted Daryl Clark's pass to race 70 metres to touch down for their fourth try and the Giants still had time to add a final try through Crabtree.
