ITV and BBC pundits have been ridiculed online after they took contrasting approaches to fashion for the World Cup final last night. 

Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Alan Hansen and Rio Ferdinand plumped for suits and ties for the occasion in their studio in Rio de Janeiro.

While Adrian Chiles, Martin O’Neill, Ian Wright, Lee Dixon and Glenn Hoddle were on Ipanema beach in open shirts and shades.

Both teams were lampooned for their fashion sense with some wondering if the ITV team were 'on a lad's holiday' and the BBC boys were 'off to a funeral after the match'. 

The BBC team were described as ‘looking like sales reps’ and even Ferdinand joked later that his outfit made him look like a pilot for budget airline easyJet.

Smart-casual: ITV's team, meanwhile, wore open-top shirts as they discussed the match on Ipanema beach

It was the first time the BBC and ITV went head-to-head during the  World Cup, as both channels had the chance to show the showpiece final between Germany and Argentina at the Maracana.

The decision to take to the beach particularly backfired for the ITV team according to viewers.

With sharp sunshine still blazing in Brazil, Dixon, Wright and Hoddle needed sunglasses to shield their eyes as they discussed Germany and Argentina’s chances ahead of kick-off.

Later, as the game ran into extra time, the ITV team were left sat in near darkness still sat on the Rio sand. 

Viewers also said the sound of crashing waves was so loud that the pundits could not hear eachother. 

Some suggested that the BBC's decision to wear suits and ties was because Alan Hansen was retiring.

The former Liverpool defender was making his final appearance for the BBC, after 22 years on the screen

Wind-swept: Hoddle's hair blew in the wind as he spoke about Germany's chances of winning

The
 59-year-old moved into punditry after retiring from playing in 1991 and
 during his time with the BBC he worked with presenters and pundits 
including Des Lynam, Lineker and his long-time side-kick Mark Lawrenson.

On his BBC departure, Hansen said: ‘Twenty-two years on an iconic programme, with the best people working for the best organisation, it can't get much better than that.’ 

The contrasts in style was the cource of much chat on Twitter, and overall ITV decision to head to the beach was the least popular. 

Chris Goodacre ‏wrote: 'BBC mean business tonight, nice to see ITV are still living up their 'lads' holiday'.

Michael Lamont ‏tweeted: 'Turned over to ITV for the end of their coverage. Awful. The pundits can't hear each other because of the waves breaking on the beach!!'

Nicola Smith ‏wrote: 'Just turned over to ITV, hilarious. Five men on beach front sat round a pasting table. Makes ill fitting suits on BBC look classy!'
