House Speaker John Boehner accused Democrats in the Senate on Thursday of using funding for the Homeland Security Department as 'blackmail' as they attempt to protect President Barack Obama's immigration measures.

Boehner's comments came after Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said at a press conference that House Republicans would be guaranteeing a shut down of the department when Saturday rolls around if they continue down the path that they're on. 

'If they send over a bill with all the riders in it, they’ve shut down the government. We’re not going to play games,' Reid said during a joint press conference this morning with his counterpart in the lower chamber, Nancy Pelosi.

'Outrageous': House Speaker John Boehner accused Senate Democrats on Thursday of 'using Homeland Security funding for blackmail to protect the actions of the president'

Boehner's tough talk came after House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, left, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, right, said at a news conference that Republicans in the House would be to blame if the Department of Homeland Security goes into shutdown mode tomorrow night because on the fight on Capitol Hill

Sparks flew on Capitol Hill on Thursday as the deadline to appropriate money to DHS rapidly approached.

The White House, however, seemed confident that the situation would resolve itself in a timely manner, and the president's spokesman told reporters on Thursday that Obama had no immediate plans to get involved in the fight, which he characterized as 'a party dispute,' not a partisan one.

Senate Democrats ended their filibuster on Wednesday of legislation to fund DHS after GOP leaders agreed to hold a separate vote on Obama's immigration directives. 

Members are expected to pass a bill before they go home for the week that would keep the Homeland Security up and running through the end of the fiscal year. They will take a separate vote to block the president's programs at a later date.

Boehner would not say on Thursday whether he would bring the 'clean' bill that is free of language restricting the department from using its funds to implement Obama's directives to the floor of the House once it passes in the Senate.

'We’re waiting to see what the Senate can or can’t do, and then we’ll make decisions about how we’re going to proceed,' he said at a briefing.

'I just think it’s outrageous that Senate Democrats are using Homeland Security funding for blackmail to protect the actions of the president, where the president himself said he didn’t have the authority to do this,' Boehner said. 

The GOP leader rejected the White House's repeated claims that the DHS dispute is a fight ‘amongst Republicans.’ 

'It is not a fight amongst Republicans. All Republicans agree that we want to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and we want to stop the president’s executive actions with regard to immigration,' he contended.

He then stuck out at the president for sitting 'there like a bump on a log watching Senate Democrats filibuster the debate on this bill.'

'If they send over a bill with all the riders in it, they’ve shut down the government. We’re not going to play games,' Reid said. The Nevada Democrat is sporting glasses this week as his right eye recovers from surgery

Pelosi showed at the press conference on Thursday with sunglasses to show her solidarity with her Senate counterpart, who has been unable to see out of his right eye since New Year's Day when he injured himself while exercizing

The White House confirmed on Thursday that the president has not inserted himself directly into the argument in Congress, even as time runs out to come to an agreement, because he is hopeful Boehner to follow the 'responsible course' of action.

'I think that everybody expects' once the DHS funding bill comes up for a vote, it will get bipartisan support in the Senate and in the House, Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said.

The real question, he said, is whether Boehner will allow that to happen. 

'If its necessary for the president to speak to him directly about how important it is to fund the Department of Homeland Security, he'll have that conversation,' Earnest said, but 'I would anticipate that the speaker of the house understands the stakes...of this action.' 

The White House Press Secretary's cool tone toward the situation appeared to be an about-face from earlier in the week when the administration was on the verge of making doomsday warnings about the consequences of withholding money from the department responsible for protecting Americans from terrorists.

Department of Homeland Security Chief Jeh Johnson held two news conference urging lawmakers to come to their senses and made the rounds on Capitol Hill in person on Thursday to confront them directly.

Obama claimed Monday that withholding the funds would have 'direct impact' on national security.

Wednesday, at a town hall on immigration hosted by MSNBC and Telemundo, the president said Republicans were 'trying to hold hostage' DHS's money 'which is so important for our national security.'

More nonchalant about the matter than his boss had been the night before, Earnest still maintained on Thursday that a shutdown would 'would have negative consequences for the country' and that furloughing thousands of DHS workers 'can't be good for our homeland security.'

According to one estimate, 30,000 of the department's employees would be kept off the job on the funding battle concluded. That would leave as many as 200,000 workers on the clock, but they would not be paid until Congress agreed on terms to fund DHS.
