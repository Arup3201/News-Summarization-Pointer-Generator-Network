A 21-year-old woman has saved her mother’s life by giving her a kidney.

Milissa Hutchinson, known as Millie, from Walsall, went under the knife on Valentine's Day to donate a kidney to her mother, Mandy.

Mrs Hutchinson, 49, had been suffering from kidney failure for more than a year after her body's immune system began attacking her kidneys.

Her daughter immediately volunteered to help after helplessly watching her become dependent upon dialysis.

She said she wanted to repay her mother for giving her the gift of life.

Ms Hutchinson said: ‘I nominated myself straight away - I hated seeing my mum so ill.

‘It was scary but all worthwhile when I woke up and realised I had saved someone’s life. Knowing it's my mum makes it feel even better.

‘Being wheeled down the theatre when there is technically nothing wrong with you was the strangest situation to be in, as normally you're going in to improve your own health.’

After just one week in University Hospital Coventry, Ms Hutchinson is now back at home and recovering.

She said: ‘I'm recovering really well and my mum came home yesterday too.

‘My mum being ill has changed my life forever, I used to be a typical 21-year-old and went out all the time with friends but now I'd rather spend time with my mum.’

Ten months ago the family were told that a live donor was possible and that Ms Hutchinson was a match, but it took until this month for the operation to go ahead because doctors needed to check the pair were both healthy enough for the operation.

Ms Hutchinson said: ‘When we were told it was possible for my mum to have a live donor, I didn't give it a second thought to give my kidney away. I don't need two of them anyway.’

Mrs Hutchinson, who works in Asda, suffers from a rare immune condition which is thought to occur after pregnancy.

It develops when some cells from the baby remain inside the mother and her body starts to attack them.

Ms Hutchinson, who is her mother's carer, has seen first-hand how kidney failure can affect someone's life and is now keen to raise awareness of live donations.

She has set up a Facebook page - Our Transplant Journey Millie & Mandy - which has received nearly 3,000 likes.

Ms Hutchinson (pictured with her mother) says she used to want to go out with her friends every night but that her mother's illness means she now prefers staying at home with her

Mrs Hutchinson has now also left hospital so mother and daughter are recovering at home together

Her father, Roy, said: ‘I'm just so proud of Millie, it's amazing what she's been able to do for her mum.’

Ms Hutchinson said: ‘It was a scary journey to go through but it was all worth it when I saw how much better she already looks.

‘When we first saw each other after the operation we both cried, it's such an emotional thing to go through but I'd do it all over again for my mum.’
