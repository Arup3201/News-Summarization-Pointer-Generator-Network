Poland's foreign minister has allegedly been caught on tape comparing his country's relationship with the U.S. as like giving oral sex for nothing in return.

Radek Sikorski is said to have made the controversial remarks during a private conversation with Jacek Rostowski, an MP and former finance minister, after they were published by influential news magazine Wprost.

In a short transcript of the conversation, a person identified as Sikorski also says Poland's strong alliance with the U.S. was worthless and 'even harmful because it creates a false sense of security.'

'The Polish-American alliance is not 
worth anything. It’s even damaging, because it creates a false sense of 
security in Poland,' Sikorski allegedly said in a translation by Russia Today.

'Complete
 bulls***,' the tape purportedly records Sikorski as saying. 'We will 
get a conflict with both Russians and Germans, and we’re going to think 
that everything is great, because we gave the Americans a blow***. 
Suckers. Total suckers.'

He
 allegedly goes on to criticise Poles as naive, in the latest recorded 
revelation from magazine Wprost to rattle Prime Minister Donald Tusk's 
government.

'The problem in
 Poland is that we have a very shallow pride and low self-esteem,' he 
allegedly said, decrying such a mindset as 'Murzyńskość', a 
racially-charged pejorative term that could be translated as 'thinking 
like a negro.' Sikorski suggested on Twitter the translation should be 
'negritude,' linking it to the anti-colonialism movement in Europe, 
according to Russia Today.

The
 Foreign Ministry declined to comment, but did not deny that Sikorski made 
the remarks. Government spokesman Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska said 
officials would only comment after the recording is published in full.

Wprost has only provided a transcript of excerpts of the conversation, which it said was recorded in the spring. The magazine has said the sound files will be published today or tomorrow.

While the alleged Sikorski comments do not reveal any illegal actions, if confirmed, they would likely put Poland's top diplomat on the defensive. The prime minister's office said Tusk was likely to address the issue Monday.

Diplomatic storm: It is the latest recorded revelation from magazine Wprost to rattle Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government

Wprost already last week set off a 
political storm with the release of a recording of a conversation 
between central bank head Marek Belka and Interior Minister Bartlomiej 
Sienkiewicz.

In the recording, the two discussed how the bank could help
 the governing party win re-election in 2015, an apparent violation of 
the bank's independence. Critics responded by calling on Tusk's 
government to resign.

Sikorski has been an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and has strongly criticized Russian actions in neighboring Ukraine this year. In the past he was a strong supporter of the United States.

But he has become more critical of Washington in recent years, especially after President Barack Obama's attempted 'reset' of ties with Russia in 2009 and the subsequent scaling-down of the U.S. missile defense plan for Poland and other parts of eastern Europe. Amid recent violence in Ukraine, Sikorski has been calling for a substantial U.S. troop presence on Polish soil.

He has also been widely mentioned as a possible successor to Catherine Ashton as the EU's foreign policy chief. Poland officially put him forward as a candidate last month.

'The publishing of the tapes poses a threat to the social and political order of the state," sociologist Henryk Domanski said on TVN24 news channel. "This will have repercussions for Sikorski and for his international career, but on the other hand, Sikorski is known in the world for his strong, extreme statements.'

Wprost has not revealed the source of the recordings, other than to say that they were obtained from a businessman who did not make them. In Poland, secretly recording a conversation is a crime.

Some Poles wonder whether Russia might have a hand in the revelations, on the argument that the Kremlin benefits from a destabilized Poland.

While the source of the recording remains unclear, political analyst Rafal Chwedoruk said he believed that the case was about political fighting and 'internal games' — with international implications.

'But if indeed foreign intelligence was involved, that involvement would be so deeply hidden that we would not be able to track it down for years,' he told The Associated Press.
