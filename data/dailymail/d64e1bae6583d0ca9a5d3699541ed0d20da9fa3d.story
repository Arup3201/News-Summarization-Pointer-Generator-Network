American judo champ Nicholas Delpopolo has been booted from the Olympic Games after testing positive for marijuana.

Delpopolo, who had finished seventh in the 73kg judo event, accepted his expulsion on Monday.

He said, however, that the positive test was caused by inadvertently eating food that he did not realise had been baked with the recreational drug.

The 23-year-old judoka from Westfield, New Jersey, said his positive test was he consumed the cannabis before leaving for London.

'I apologise to U.S. Olympic Committee, to my teammates, and to my fans, and I am embarrassed by this mistake,' he said in a statement. 

He went on: 'I look forward to representing my country in the future, and will rededicate myself to being the best judo athlete that I can be.'

He waived the right for his case to be heard before the Disciplinary Commission.

U.S. Olympic Committee spokesman 
Patrick Sandusky said in a statement that his group is 'absolutely 
committed to clean competition and stringent anti-doping penalties.

Cannabis's place on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) prohibited list has sparked much debate.

President John Fahey indicated earlier this year that WADA may look at changing the criteria for cannabis as a banned substance.

At the moment, a substance appears on the banned list if it meets the following criteria: it is proven to be performance enhancing, it goes against the spirit of sport, or it is dangerous to the health of athletes.

Marijuana, or cannabis, is forbidden under current rules, with athletes facing a two-year ban if it is found in their system.

While it is generally accepted that cannabis is unlikely to give athletes an advantage in fast-paced sports, some experts say it could prove helpful in sports like shooting or golf where a steady hand is needed.

Any
positive test, for any banned substance, comes with the appropriate 
consequences and we absolutely support the disqualification.'

Delpopolo, according to his official Olympic biography, was born Petra Perovic in the former Yugoslavia.

 He was adopted by an American family who changed his name.

According to Britain’s National Health Service, the amount of time that marijuana remains in the body depends on how often the person smokes it.

If the subject has only smoked marijuana once or twice, it will be gone form the body within several days.

But for heavier smokers, it takes an average of two weeks to one month for it to leave their system, although it can be longer.

Long-term users may still have weed in their body two to three months after they last smoked it.

Delpopolo brings the number of athletes suspended by the IOC to five since the start of the Olympic period on July 16.

He joins Colombian 400 meters runner Diego Palomeque Echevarria and Russian cyclist Victoria Baranova who both tested positive for testosterone.

Belarussian hammer thrower Ivan Tsikhan and Moroccan runner Amine Laalou were also ruled out with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) saying they had been charged with anti-doping rule violations.

Several other athletes, including Brazilian rower Kissya Cataldo da Costa who was expelled for failing a dope test for the blood-boosting EPO, have been sent home by their own federations.

Delpopolo is set to leave London for the United States on Tuesday where he will attempt to piece his career back together.
