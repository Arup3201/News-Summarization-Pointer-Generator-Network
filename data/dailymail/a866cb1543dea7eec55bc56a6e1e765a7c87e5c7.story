Louis van Gaal has refused to speculate on claims that Gareth Bale is subject to interest from Manchester United.

In a survey of 30,000 Real Madrid supporters, 54% said they would be happy for the club to accept a bid of €150million Source: AS.com 

Reports in Spain on Tuesday had stated that Van Gaal is willing to offer Real Madrid £120million to bring the Welshman back to the Premier League, but the United boss was vague in his response.

'I cannot discuss that with you,' Van Gaal said. 'I discuss that with my CEO and not with anyone of the media.'

The deal would smash the current world transfer record, coincidentally set by Bale's £86million move to Real Madrid last summer.

It is not the first time the Red Devils have expressed an interest in the Wales winger. When the 25-year-old was intent on leaving Tottenham, United eventually lost out to Real Madrid in the race to sign him.

A survey on Spanish newspaper website AS.com on Tuesday asked Real Madrid fans if they would be happy with the club letting him go for the right price, with 54% responding that they would be willing to let Bale leave the Bernabeu.
