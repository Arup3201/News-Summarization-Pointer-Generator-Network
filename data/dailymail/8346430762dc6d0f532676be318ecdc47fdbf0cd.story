There can be no relaxing into paternity leave for Novak Djokovic, not when trying to fend off the remarkable charge of Roger Federer back towards the world No 1 ranking.

Djokovic has left wife Jelena and new-born son Stefan behind to defend the Paris Masters this week, knowing that Federer is close to striking a blow for the supposed tennis geriatrics by joining fellow 33-year-old Serena Williams at the summit of the season-end rankings. 

If the Swiss wins this last significant ATP Tour event of the year and Djokovic fails to make the final then the Serb will effectively hand over the position next Monday.

Even if Federer fails to reach the summit here he can still topple Djokovic if he significantly outperforms him at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in London.

All this is happening slightly over the head of Andy Murray, despite his recent surge of form, and he plays his first match in the French capital tomorrow — against either Julien Benneteau or Taiwan’s Lu Yen-hsun — after winning the Valencia Open final.

Federer has not won a major since Wimbledon 2012 and few would have expected him to rebound from a difficult 2013 with a season of such consistency. He has won two Masters-level events, three regular ATP tournaments and reached five finals, including Wimbledon.

Andy Murray can seal qualification for the ATP World Tour Finals by reaching the quarter-finals of this week's Paris Masters.

Even if he was to lose his opening match, all of the following would have to happen for him to miss out on the season-ending finale in London:

Whether he reaches the top spot will depend partly on how much energy he has, and on whether Djokovic manages to finish the season strongly. Despite his new arrival he insists he is well prepared ahead of tonight’s match with Philipp Kohlschreiber.

Djokovic, who was gloriously outplayed in the Shanghai semi-final by Federer earlier this month, is not close to his rival but praised his evergreen qualities: ‘I have a lot of respect for what he does, he’s playing some of his best ever tennis this season,’ said the 27-year-old.

‘Last year was his worst in 10 years but I never signed him out. He’s coming close behind in the rankings and I’m sure he’s going to be very motivated, it’s pretty much open.’
