The government's handling of the inquiry into historic child abuse face fresh criticism today after its second chairman who was forced to resign was made a dame.

Fiona Woolf quit the probe in October after failing to declare the extent of her links to Tory peer Leon Brittan, who was allegedly handed a dossier detailing abuse.

But today Lady Butler-Sloss - the first chairman to be appointed before resigning - said criticism of the honour awarded to Dame Fiona was 'very unfair' as the damehood was in recognition of her term as Lord Mayor of London.

The decision to hand Dame Fiona a gong so soon after the abuse inquiry fiasco will be contentious with abuse survivors who campaigned to have her thrown off the committee. 

Critics may suspect the honour was a sop to compensate her for losing the job. 

Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the Civil Service, said: 'Her honour reflects what she has achieved throughout her career.'

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who exposed the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, said the damehood 'seems inappropriate', adding: 'I can think of many more worthy recipients … once again it looks like the Establishment are looking after their own.'

He added: 'The public will be disappointed that people such as Fiona Woolf are receiving honours when there are people who are much more worthy of an honour, people who have done courageous things, or have achieved things for their country.

'I'm sure her achievements warrant an honour but the timing is a bit off. I suspect some people might be upset and it might have been more appropriate to let a bit of time elapse.'

However, Lady Butler-Sloss today leapt to her defence, blaming the Home Office for failing to perform proper checks on Dame Fiona's links to former home secretary Lord Brittan.

Lady Butler-Sloss, who stood down from her role on the troubled inquiry in July because her brother, Sir Michael Havers, was attorney general in the 1980s, was speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme in her role as guest editor.

Defending the decision to award the honour, she said: 'She was Lord Mayor of London, she is only the second woman ever to be Lord Mayor of London.

'The very least that the honours system could do would be to honour a woman who has got such a distinguished post.

'Unfortunately she had, like myself, a brief period where she had agreed - for goodness sake, she had agreed to do a very disagreeable job to become chairman.

'And because she happened to know Leon Brittan, she was unacceptable to the survivors and therefore she stood down.'

She criticised officials for failing to spot the potential difficulties the contacts with Lord Brittan could cause.

'I don't know what happened. There was discussion between her and, presumably, the Home Office.

'I think they made a mistake in not doing sufficient due diligence, actually.

'But the fact is she is a very distinguished woman, she did a wonderful year's job as Lord Mayor and of course she gets an honour for it, that's why she gets it.

After Dame Fiona was appointed to the role, it emerged she had close links to Lord Brittan, who is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry

'To put if off to another time would be a reflection on the City of London.'

Edinburgh-born Woolf, a City of London lawyer already honoured with a CBE in 2001, was made a Dame for services to the legal profession, diversity and the City of London in the New Year Honours.

But Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale and a leading figure campaigning against child abuse cover-ups, was scathing about the honour.

He said: 'Fiona Woolf misled the Home Secretary over her links with Leon Brittan, caused unnecessary distress to victims of child abuse and caused a lengthy and avoidable delay to a very serious inquiry that urgently needs to get started.

'It seems inappropriate that she's now being invited to Buckingham Palace to pick up one of the highest honours.

'I can think of many more worthy recipients of this honour, but once again it looks like the Establishment is looking after their own.'

Dame Fiona's links to Lord Brittan prompted the calls for her resignation.

Lord Brittan is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry over a dossier he received from MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, documenting the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring.
