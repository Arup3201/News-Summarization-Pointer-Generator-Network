A giant treehouse nestled in the branches of a 200-year-old oak tree is available for hire as your very own castle in the sky.

But far from being just a playhouse, the holiday wonderland six metres off the ground comes complete with all the modcons including a dishwasher and a giant copper roll top bath.

Owners Nick and Tara Culverhouse were searching for a way to preserve the beautiful tree that has stood in the grounds of their hotel for the last 200 years.

Soak it all up: The treehouse is a world away from camping and even glamping and has all the furnishings on a modern home

When they realised they could turn it into the location for a brilliant property they set about working on a design with Bower House construction.

The completely self-contained house which opened this year measures 40m-sq and has a master bedroom on the top floor, a room for two children with bunk beds, and a sitting room with French doors onto a deck, as well as a fully functioning kitchen and bathroom.

Just like any other new house, it had to be built in line with modern building regulations and is highly insulated with double glazing. The luxury treehouse even has underfloor heating.

Tea for two: It may look like a playhouse, but the treehouse has every luxurious touch imaginable

In order to preserve the tree the building is supported by stilts and can move freely as the wind sways the branches.

But an evening in the sky is no budget holiday and a stay in the luxury treehouse in the grounds of the Fox and Hounds Country Hotel in Eggesford, Devon starts at £245 a night.

Gill Churchill, assistant general manager at the hotel who manages bookings for the treehouse said: ‘It was screaming out to be put to good use.

‘It's the biggest the builders have ever put together.

‘When people come and stay the reaction is always really positive.

‘Nobody can believe that they are actually living in a tree house and that there's a roll-top bath and a dish washer nestled up in the trees.

‘Each person finds something different that they love about it.’
