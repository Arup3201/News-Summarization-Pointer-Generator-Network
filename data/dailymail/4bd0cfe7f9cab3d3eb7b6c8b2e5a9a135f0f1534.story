A history expert was amazed to discover an undeveloped film inside a vintage camera bought by her boyfriend - and is now trying to track down the people in the photos.

Michala Hulme, from Knutsford, Cheshire, received an AGFA box camera for her birthday and found an undeveloped film, which after processing revealed four photographs.

The photos are of a group of relatives or friends at a train station, and are believed to have been taken in the 1930s or 40s.

Miss Hulme's boyfriend bought the AGFA box camera at a Knutsford antiques shop

Intriguingly, it shows part of a sign behind the group with rail destinations including Bournemouth, Plymouth and Penzance.

The camera was bought by Miss Hulme's boyfriend at a Knutsford antiques shop but originally came from an auction in Stockport, where the 31-year-old genealogist grew up.

Now she is trying to find descendants of the people in the pictures.

She said: 'I received the camera from my boyfriend for my birthday on Christmas Eve. It is a German-made camera from around 1939. I had the film developed straight away at a shop in Didsbury.

She said: 'Being a genealogist I know how hard it is to get pictures of peoples' ancestors so I would love to be able to reunite these pictures with the family or persons they belong to'

'Eight pictures were developed but only four were clear. They seem to show someone either visiting relatives or someone going somewhere, and are all set at a train station.

AGFA was the abbreviation for Aktien-Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Anilin-Fabrikation, given in 1873 to a company that had been founded in Berlin in 1867. It produced chemicals for photography.

AGFA obtained the Rietzschel camera works in Munich from Bayer in 1925 and badged all its products with its distinct rhombus logo.

In 1926 it introduced the first real Agfa camera, the Standard, belived to be the model owned by Miss Hulme.

'Being a genealogist I know how hard it is to get pictures of peoples' ancestors so I would love to be able to reunite these pictures with the family or persons they belong to.

'I know it is a long shot but it is worth a go.'

Michala said that going on the way the people are dressed she would date the pictures to around the time of World War Two.

'This is all I know, it's a bit of a mystery really,' she added.

Miss Hulme is an ancestry expert on BBC Radio Manchester and Radio Lancashire and has traced family trees for celebrities including comedian Justin Moorhouse and Hollywood actor Quinton Jackson.
