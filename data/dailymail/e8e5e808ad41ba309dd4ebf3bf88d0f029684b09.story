It's back! Starbucks has decided to bring back its beloved Eggnog Latte after fans were furious over its disappearance from the holiday menu 

Starbucks has decided to bring back its Eggnog Latte, following a huge outcry from customers when the company announced it was discontinuing the beverage.

The drink, which the brand had been selling seasonally since 1986, was cut to 'simplify' its holiday menu, according to USA Today. 

'We made a mistake,' said Starbucks spokeswoman Linda Mills. 'We are very sorry.'

Ms Mills said she expects the drink to be back in stores sometime during the week of November 17.

'It's a fairly complex product to bring back,' she said. 'We have to be able to source the eggnog itself.'

The brand is also putting Gingerbread Lattes back on the menus at Pacific Northwest, where they were cut.

Once fans realized in early November that Eggnog Lattes weren't on the holiday menu, hundreds took to Twitter to voice their anger.

One user, @saucypeeps, said, 'I tolerated your Pumpkin Spice Latte, but if you don't bring back the Eggnog Latte, I will quit you.'

Another user, @emmawingfield, said upon finding out, 'There goes my holiday cheer.'

And one Twitter user, @jeffybum, went as far as to post a picture (perhaps a selfie) of an exasperated-looking man with the text, 'Where's my eggnog latte?!' printed over it.  

Unhappy camper! Twitter user @saucypeeps was not pleased about Starbucks's decision to remove Eggnog Lattes from its menu

Starbucks is a grinch! User @EmmaWingfield echoed the sentiment, saying the holidays just wouldn't be the same without the drink

Not coming back! User @barberchicago Tweeted that Starbucks would be losing her as a customer 

It won't be the same! User @jeffybum posted a picture (maybe a selfie) summing up his feelings about the disappearance of the Eggnog Latte 

A representative from Starbucks announced the Eggnog Latte's return on the brand's blog, My Starbucks Idea.

'This week you lit My Starbucks Idea up and let us know through email, tweets, and phone calls that these drinks, served up in the iconic red Starbucks cup, are an indispensable part of your holiday traditions,' she wrote. 'These messages were emotional, personal. They told of times connecting with loved ones over an Eggnog Latte, how the Eggnog Latte became a tradition. We're honored you care so much—and chagrined we risked dimming your holiday brightness, even a little.'

Dozens of readers showed their gratitude in the comments section of the post.

One user proclaimed the beverage's return 'a Christmas miracle' while another said, 'Christmas never would be the same without my Eggnog Latte!'

Some customers still weren't happy, however. 

'Your decision to not put them on the menu this year got me motivated to SCREW YOU,' wrote the commenter. 'I bought a Nespresso machine and my first gallon of eggnog today to keep the tradition alive! Cost Plus also sells a nice Gingerbread Syrup. So this year I just won't be coming back, YOU LOST ME!'  

Another person wrote in, 'Grateful for the reversal, but angry for the weeks missed.

'Be careful in the future. #FirstWorldProblem? Sure. But I am thankful to be in the "first world."'
