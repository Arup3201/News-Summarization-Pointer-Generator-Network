Tourists in France are set to be stung by a rise in hotel tax – of a whopping 500 per cent.

France's foreign minister has joined tourist chiefs in attacking the increase.

The controversial measure, which has already been approved by Parliament after being initiated by Socialist MPs, will see up to £8 added to Paris's already sky-high room rates.

Laurent Fabius, the foreign secretary, said the measure was 'dangerous and totally contrary to the promotion of tourism, a priority for jobs.'

If rubber-stamped by the Senate, visitors to French hotels would find a tax of £6.40 (Euro 8) on their bills, rather than the current £1.20 (Euro 1.50).

This figure will rise to £8 (Euro 10) in Paris - the most popular tourist destination in the world, where the biggest visitor group among some 30 million a year are the British.

While small hotels will be able to charge less, critics said the measure will stop people coming to France, which has plunged into economic chaos since a Socialist government came to power in 2012.

Roland Heguy, a hotel trade unionist, attacked 'irresponsible measures that will have grave consequences for our hotels, which me must remind people are "Made in France" businesses.

'The hotels that I represent are extremely angry, and request that members of parliament and the government instantly stop this massacre.'

Hotel and restaurant owners are already smarting over a VAT hike to 10 per cent, along with other measures aimed at increasing government revenue.

'The situation is becoming intolerable,' said Paris hotel manager Jacques Houllier. 'A few years ago you could get a hotel room for a fair price, but now you need to be very rich indeed. Ordinary people just can't stay here, and the industry is suffering enormously because of this.'

The Socialists, in turn, hope the massively increased hotel tax will generate the equivalent of around £112 million a year.

Mr Fabius, who is in charge of tourism in France, has laid out plans to increase visitor numbers from the current 83 million a year to 100 million.
