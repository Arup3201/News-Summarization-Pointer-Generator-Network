Husband and wife Albert and Carolee Hickman

A husband and wife used black magic to terrify an 11-year-old schoolgirl into taking part in depraved sex sessions, a jury has heard.

Their alleged victim blotted out her three-year ordeal for almost four decades before a torrent of suppressed memories resurfaced, a court was told.

Carolee Hickman, 64, is accused of preying on the Bridgend schoolgirl, convincing her she was a witch in a powerful coven linked to devil worship.

Her terrified victim allegedly returned to Hickman’s home again and again, where she was regularly sexually abused.

Hickman gave the girl and a number of her friends 'pagan crosses' to wear and plied them with cigarettes and alcohol, it is claimed.

Husband Albert Hickman, 65, allegedly raped the schoolgirl during an encounter set up by his wife.

Hickman was with the RAF based at St Athan during the period in question.

A jury at Cardiff Crown Court watched a DVD recording of an interview the couple’s alleged victim made for the police.

A bearded Hickman listened in silence. His wife sat in court in a mobility scooter.

He denies a single charge of rape.

His wife denies three counts of indecent assault and one of aiding and abetting rape.

All charges relate to a period between September 1972 and September 1975.

The jury has been told the couple have already been jailed in the past after being found guilty of indecently assaulting children.

Their alleged victim, now aged 52, said in interview that she began visiting the couple with other friends aged 11.

She said Hickman later claimed she was a witch, talked about the occult, used black magic and did readings with tarot cards.

She said the older woman used a bejewelled knife wrapped in black silk, and kept in a wooden box, to cut the girl’s thumb and suck the blood.

'She got us believing in Satan and that she was this powerful person,' said the alleged victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.

'She used to tell me that I was hers, I was special.

'She told me that in the night she was going to come and get me and take me to her coven and they would fetch the devil and I would be part of the circle.

'Being so young I was gullible and believed her.'

The court heard repressed memories of her schoolgirl abuse allegedly resurfaced during bereavement counselling after the death of a son.

The trial continues.
