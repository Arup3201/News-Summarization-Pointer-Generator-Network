A rugby coach and father-of-three has died after apparently suffering an allergic reaction shortly after being stung by wasps.

William Lay, 43, had been getting tools out of his garage when he was stung by the insects.

The popular man from Oxford was rushed to hospital where doctors battled to save his life, but his reaction to the sting was so severe that he fell into a coma and died four days later.

Coma: Father-of-three William lay died four days after being rushed to hospital with wasp stings

In a statement, Oxford Rugby Club, wrote: 'Will was stung by wasps while getting tools out of his garage and suffered a major allergic reaction.

'He will be remembered for his enthusiasm and calm demeanor - two traits ideally suited for coaching children.

'The club wishes to pass on their deepest sympathy to his immediate family, especially his three children, Matt, Ollie and Tilly, two of whom played for Oxford.

'This has come as a huge shock, not just to the age group that Will coached, but to the club as a whole. He was a very popular and hardworking club member.

'Not only did he give up a considerable amount of his time in his role as a coach, but he was also fully involved in any social or fundraising events held by the club.

'He will be sorely missed and our thoughts are with his family at this sad time.'

South Central Ambulance Service spokesman Michelle Archer confirmed that ambulances were called just before 8.15am on July 30 to the house in Netherton, near Fyfield, Oxfordshire, following reports of a man in a 'life-threatening condition'.

Emergency: Mr Lay was rushed to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, but doctors were unable to save the father-of-three

The air ambulance, a road ambulance and a rapid response car were sent to the scene.

Paramedics treated Mr Lay at the scene and he was then taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in the road ambulance with a doctor from the air ambulance helping paramedics.

Fyfield Parish Council chairman John Watts said he believed Mr Lay had an epipen with him at the time of the sting.

This allows those with a history of anaphylaxis - a severe type of allergic reaction caused by things such as wasp stings and nuts - to inject adrenaline into themselves.

Mr Watts added: 'I know he was stunned and then went into shock. They tried to revive him, but it didn’t work.'

Mark Ainsworth-Smith, a consultant practitioner with South Central Ambulance Service, said that an epipen will buy an extra five minutes.

He added: 'It’s life-threatening unless treatment is given fairly quickly, which is why patients are given epipens to buy them time.

'Usually a reaction to a sting will start within minutes, and can be fatal after five minutes.'

Mr Lay’s funeral will be held at St Nicholas Church, Fyfield, on Monday.
