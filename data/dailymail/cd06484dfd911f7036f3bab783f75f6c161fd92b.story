A sheep and cattle grazier is using her 32,000 hectare farm to help drought-stricken farmers get fit.

Instead of using traditional equipment, Joy McClymont uses things lying around her 32,000-hectare farm to train her clients by using irrigation pipes as weights, swing truck springs in place of kettle bells, tyres to do push ups and the dam to run laps around.

Then passes on her tips and tricks to her fitness program clients.

Mother-of-four Joy McClymont lives out in Queensland's central west and started Off The Track Training

This is helping producers in Ms McClymont's region get their minds of the crippling drought which has gripped more than 70 per cent of Queensland.

The former triathlete, who lives 100km from Longreach in the state's central west, told Woman's Day three-quarters of her clients were suffering from the dry conditions.

She said the process of getting and keeping fit had been therapeutic.

'I tell them [my clients] their fitness is the one thing they can actually control and exercise will change the way they face the day. It tricks you - you feel like you're 10 kilograms lighter and bulletproof,' Ms McClymont said.

'For me, this has been sanity saving.'

She wanted her clients to use equipment they already had their farm with spending a huge amount of money

This includes moon rocks as medicine balls (above) and irrigation pipes as weights

Ms McClymont used to be a competitive triathlon and qualified for an ironwoman competition

Ms McClymont said the idea of starting an outback fitness program that people could access online came after the birth of her first child with her husband, Paul.

She now has four children aged from one to six years old.

The former ironwoman qualifier found it was extremely difficult for her to get back on the horse after her pregnancy because of the remoteness of her home.

'I just wanted to do something to make it easier for people to look after their health and do something for themselves in tough times, especially when there's a drought,' Ms McClymont told Daily Mail Australia.

'It also makes it easier for them to manage their stress when their health is better.' 

That's when she started up Off The Track Training, which gives people living in rural areas access to all the benefits of a metropolitan personal trainer.

Ms McClymont and her group of trained professionals provides tailored training programs, meal plans and nutritional advice to clients from the Northern Territory, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland.

They also get face-to-face time with Ms McClymont and her team when required as well as contact through Facebook or the phone.

These programs can last from 50 days to 100 days depending on her clients' needs.

She said this communication helped build a support network for those who are drought-stricken.

'When you live on a property, so much of your identity is tied to the place. When it doesn't perform well, people often have nothing else in their lives.'  

Ms McClymont recommends exercising outside to utilise the landscape and get fresh air into the body

Ms McClymont is helping those living in remote and rural areas to get their minds off the Queensland drought

Currently, more than 70 per cent of Queensland is suffering drought conditions and have been doing so for three years

Ms McClymont told Daily Mail Australia said she did not wanting her clients to spend more money on equipment they would not use.

'The idea is to get them to exercise on their property,' she said.

'I want them to use what they have, so they can be seriously sustainable and they're not spending buckets of money to exercise.

'People buy my programs but they buy the connection, the network... That is what is needed mostly, they need support to get them there.'  

Tyres are also a good way to exercise. Ms McClymont recommends running over them and using to do push ups

Ms McClymont also uses her 20-kilometre driveway as a running or cycling track to keep fit

She said her best pieces of gym equipment were an irrigation pipe, round moon rocks and a crowbar.

Being out on a remote property, Ms McClymont has had to get creative with how she keeps fit.

She uses her 20-kilometre as a cycling track, does sprint exercises on her airstrip and her dam to do laps.

The mother also tries to incorporate training into her day-to-day activities.

During mustering season, Ms McClymont opts to run from one gate to another instead of driving her ute.

She said her best pieces of gym equipment were an irrigation pipe, round moon rocks and a crowbar.
