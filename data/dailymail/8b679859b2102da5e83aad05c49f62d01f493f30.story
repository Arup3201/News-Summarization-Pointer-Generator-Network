A man who escaped from a minimum security prison in Mississippi 35 years ago and was captured living in Utah has now been returned to Mississippi to serve out the remainder of his sentence, officials said on Friday.

Sam Gene Harris, 62, was sentenced in 1979 to six years in prison for burglary and possession of burglary tools, the Mississippi Department of Corrections said in a statement.

He escaped from the Forrest County Community Work Center in southern Mississippi the following year, 1980, the department said.

Mississippi authorities learned of Harris's whereabouts from the FBI, the state's prisons department said. 

Back to prison, buddy: Sam Gene Harris had escaped from two jails in Oregon before escaping the Forrest County Community Work Center in southern Mississippi in 1980. In January, 35 years later, police found him living in a tiny Utah town and arrested him (left). On Friday, he was returned to prison in Mississippi (right)

He was extradited from Utah on Sunday.

Before his arrest in January, Harris had lived in Wellington, a town of 1,600 people about 100 miles southeast of Salt Lake City, for 23 years, KSL-TV quoted a local sheriff as saying.

During his decades on the run, Harris had come into contact with law enforcement and had used aliases, said Mississippi Department of Corrections spokeswoman Grace Fisher.

He has lived under at least 10 different names, and has escaped from two other jails in Oregon.

He also has a criminal history in Florida and Georgia, including charges for theft and assaulting an officer 

At the time of his arrest, Harris was living as Wayne Stevens in a small house on a main road.

An FBI bulletin about wanted people tipped off Utah police to his identity.

Police had been staking out his home trying to get an idea of the property's layout when they saw Harris walking across the street.

They decided to pounce and arrested him.

Harris tried to convince police they had nabbed the wrong man, however fingerprints proved otherwise.

He also said he had suffered a serious brain injury a few years prior and had memory problems. 

Exact details about his escape are sketchy because it was so long ago.

However Harris remained on wanted persons lists. 

Interestingly, Harris will not incur additional prison time for his escape because fleeing from a community work center was at the time a misdemeanor, the department said in its statement.

He will be eligible for release in 2018.
