Overpaid? Jennifer Aniston was eighth on a list after her latest three films made minimal returns

She commands up to £6.5million a film. But Jennifer Aniston might not be able to bank on such high fees much longer.

The former Friends actress has found herself on the list of Hollywood’s ten most overpaid stars.

Following a string of box-office flops, 44-year-old Miss Aniston appears in eighth place in Forbes magazine’s list of stars who provide the least value for their huge fees.

The publication examined the costs of each actor’s last three films up until June 1st 2013, adding up salaries and production costs.

They then compared that with the film’s box office returns to find out which actors were the least bankable.

The star’s last three films, Wanderlust, Horrible Bosses and Just Go With It cost a total of £93m to make, including her salary costs, but brought in just under £450m.

In contrast, the world’s highest-grossing film over the past year has been Iron Man 3, which cost £122m to make and made £741m at the box office. It starred Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr.

Aniston shot to fame in 1994 playing Rachel Green in US sitcom Friends, which ran until 2004. The role earned her an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

Her biggest box office success to date was her appearance in 2003 film Bruce Almighty, in which she starred alongside Jim Carrey. The film cost £49.5m to make before going on to make almost £300m at the box office.

US comedy star Adam Sandler, who is paid almost £10m per film, topped this year’s list of overpaid stars after his last two blockbusters Jack & Jill and That’s My Boy struggled to justify their dizzying production costs.

Flop? Forbes found Horrible Bosses, starring Jennifer Aniston as Dr. Julia Harris, made a small return

Wanderlust, in which Aniston as Linda starred with Paul Rudd as George, was on of three unsuccessful recent films

Adding to the figures, Just Go With It, in which Aniston played Katherine, also failed to make an impact

Jack & Jill grossed £91m at the box office, but the film cost an estimated almost £50 million to make. Considering studios take home about half of box office receipts, that means only about £45m went to Sony, who also had to pay to advertise the film.

That’s My Boy did even worse. With an estimated budget of £42m, the film brought in only £35m at the box office worldwide. Forbes magazine estimated that for every dollar Sandler was paid on his last three movies, the films returned an average of $3.40.

His most recent film, Grown Ups 2 grossed £150m at the box office on an estimated £49m budget, making it one of Sandler’s best performing films. However, the magazine’s survey includes films that were released before June 1st this. Grown Ups 2 was released in July.

Top of the list: Adam Sandler topped the list and Katherine Heigl was second. According to Forbes, every dollar Sandler was paid on his last three films returned $3.40 on average. Meanwhile Heigl only trumped him by $0.10

His animated film Hotel Transylvania grossed £218m at the box office worldwide on a budget of £52m, but it was not enough to offset his other two films.

Close behind Sandler in second place is Katherine Heigl. For every dollar she was paid Heigl returned an average of $3.50. Reese Witherspoon came in third place with an average $3.90 return for every one dollar she was paid.

Last year, comedy star Eddie Murphy topped the list, while Drew Barrymore was named the most overpaid film star in 2011. Nicole Kidman came in first place in 2008.
