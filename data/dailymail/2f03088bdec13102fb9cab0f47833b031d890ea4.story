One in a million: Golfer Brian Hughes sank two holes-in-one in just half an hour at Ampfield Golf Club in Hampshire

A golfer who returned to the game for the first time in 30 years defied the odds to amazingly sink two holes-in-one in just half an hour.

Brian Hughes might have been forgiven for being slightly rusty having not picked up a club for almost three decades.

But the 51-year-old bagged the unbelievable one-in-a-million feat in just 30 minutes during two separate rounds at Ampfield Golf Club.

Mr Hughes' achievement was even more incredible given that he only took up the sport again - after a long absence - two months ago.

The IT systems architect shot his first ace at about 9am on the 13th hole of the course in Ampfield, Hants, while playing with his friends.

And an even louder cheer erupted when Brian sank his second hole-in-one just half an hour later while playing a different round with his wife, Sarah.

Mr Hughes, a stepfather-of-three from Romsey, Hants, said: 'The first one landed in the hole with an enormous clatter and people were soon shouting and hollering.

'I saw the second one bounce on to the green before it went out of sight and when I walked up to the hole it was in the cup.

'My wife was so excited because she's never seen someone get a hole-in-one before.'

Hughes, a former Welsh international youth amateur, gave up golf in the mid-1980s to concentrate on his university degree and career.

The odds of a professional tour player making an ace is about 3,000 to one, while for an average player the odds are 12,000 to one.

And for any player to make a brace of aces in the same round would come at staggering odds of 67 million to one.

Jubilant: The 51-year-old hadn't played the game for 30 years, which made his accomplishment even more remarkable

Both holes were par 3.

Alex Donahue, from bookmakers Ladbrokes, said Hughes' feat has odds of more than one million to one.

Ampfield club captain Kevan Vear said: 'To get one ace is always amazing but to get two in the same day is just unbelievable.'
