A company called 4Sphere is putting a new  - pardon the pun - spin on a 5,500-year-old classic: the wheel.

Wheels, as most everyone knows, are round. But not 4Sphere's Shark Wheel - rather, a Shark Wheel, designed for skateboards, is formed around a cubed center, which its inventor claims allows it to ride faster and smoother than your traditional round skateboard wheel.

In other words, the company has literally reinvented the wheel.

Behold! The wheel - reinvented

Shark Wheels

'When used on hard surfaces, the Shark Wheel produces a low friction profile similar to a high performance, low rolling resistance tire,' the company says on its Kickstarter page. 'This allows for less energy to be used as the contact patch is very small.  Conversely, a wheel that would normally work well as a low resistance wheel would perform poorly in something like soft sand.'

Shark Wheels are made up of three, helical-shaped strips that, when rolling, form a sine wave pattern when they make contact with the ground.

This pattern allows the wheel to roll faster than a traditional round wheel, the company claims, and provides better handling on rough, wet terrain.

The man who reinvented the wheel: David Patrick says he's been an avid skateboarder all his life

'It kept on going': Patrick says he dropped this 'rectangle' accidentally and noticed that it rolled

'When encountering soft surfaces, the patented design of the Shark Wheel 
produces a much wider, high friction profile which creates a wide 
surface area and unsurpassed grip, the company says. 'This ability to travel on soft 
surfaces is very similar to the way a sidewinder snake moves through the
sand.'

Shark Wheel inventor David Patrick says he got the idea for the wheel when he used six different shapes to form a perfect cube. He dropped the cube accidentally and it rolled.

'Not only did it roll,' he says in a promotional video for the Shark Wheel, 'it kept on going. The helix shape of it was perfectly balanced so no matter what the terrain, it kept on going.'

Lame: round wheels are sooo 3000 B.C.

Sidewinder: Patrick says the Shark Wheel works similar to how a 'sidewinder snake moves through the sand'

The company recently started a campaign on Kickstarter - an online fundraising website where the general public can contribute money to creative ideas - that already has garnered more than $30,000 in 10 days.

The company's initial fundraising goal was $10,000.

Patrick says the company already has plans for the wheel designed and tested. He says it will use the money from Kickstarter to start mass-producing the square-shaped wheels soon.
