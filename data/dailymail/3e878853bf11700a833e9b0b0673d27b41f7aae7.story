Serie A leaders Juventus are keen on signing Radamel Falcao, Ramires and Miranda even if they choose not to cash in on £70million-rated Paul Pogba.

La Gazzetta Sportiva have labelled 2015 'The year of Pogba' as Juventus will have to fight off interest from a selection of the world's best teams. 

Pogba has been linked with a move back to Manchester United in recent weeks but the Old Lady are keen on keeping hold of the France international.
