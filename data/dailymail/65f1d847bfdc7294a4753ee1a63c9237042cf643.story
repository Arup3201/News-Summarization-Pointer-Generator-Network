A Spanish teenager who killed a British mother and her two children in a road crash and left their father in a wheelchair, has been jailed for just three years.

Sally Austin  and children Samuel, 13, and Claire, 11, died in the horrific smash on the island of Menorca, while husband Nicholas Austin suffered life-changing spinal injuries.

They were killed after a head-on collision with another family of British holidaymakers who needed hospital treatment.

Killed: Sally Austin and children Samuel, 13, and Claire, 11, died in the horrific smash on the island of Menorca, while husband Nicholas Austin suffered life-changing spinal injuries in 2007

Mr Austin, 51 at the time, was initially thought to be at fault over the July 25 2006 accident on a road linking the island capital Mahon to the town of Ciutadella.

But a police investigation revealed Spaniard David Fernandez had clipped the holidaymaker's hire car and forced him into the path of a another vehicle driven by the second Brit family after overtaking in heavy traffic.

The local, 19 at the time, was found guilty of the manslaughter of Mrs Austin and her two children, from Billericay in Essex, through reckless driving, after a trial in Mahon.

He was also convicted of injuring Mr Austin and fellow Brits Paul Blackwell, his wife Rebecca, their son Sebastian, then five, and their daughter Francisca, then two, from Warfield near Bracknell in Berkshire.

Judges heard Fernandez, from Ciutadella in north west Majorca, had overtaken several times in heavy traffic in his souped-up Ford Probe in the run-up to the accident.

An oncoming bus was forced onto the hard shoulder to avoid a head-on crash during a near-miss moments earlier.

He hit Mr Austin's Ford Ka as he tried to slot back into his carriageway after overtaking several vehicles.

Mr Austin only found out he lost his family after waking up in intensive care in hospital on the neighbouring island of Majorca several days after the crash.

He suffered serious spinal injuries that left him unable to walk.

His daughter was thrown nearly 100 feet out of the family's hire car from the force of the impact.

Paramedics pulled her mother alive from the wreckage of the Ford Ka, which was almost cut in half by the impact of the collision, but she died shortly after.

The Blackwells were nearing the end of a two-week holiday on Menorca.

Mr Blackwell, a keen runner and regular churchgoer, suffered head injuries and spent time in intensive care.

His wife and two children suffered minor cuts and bruises and were released from hospital after treatment.

Mr Austin's elderly mother Beryl, speaking after the accident, said: 'We can't believe we have lost all three of them.

'My grandchildren were such wonderful children.

'We just have to hope now for our son.'

A local fireman, describing the scene of the accident, added: 'We arrived to find the car in which the adult and two children died cut in half in the middle of the road.

'The woman was brought out alive but died minutes later.

'Her husband was beside her and although he was conscious, he wasn't able to take in the full impact of what had happened.

'The young boy was already dead in the back of the vehicle and his sister's body had been flung into a ditch about 25 metres from the car.'

Fernandez, thought to have been travelling with a pregnant woman at the time of the crash, was also banned from driving for five years.

He was ordered to pay Mr Austin nearly Â£310,000 in compensation.

The jail sentence has already been ratified by a higher provincial court.
