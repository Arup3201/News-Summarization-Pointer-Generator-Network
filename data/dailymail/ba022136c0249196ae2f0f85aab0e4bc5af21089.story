An elephant, angered by its failed attempts to break a stick in half takes its frustration out on it by flinging it at a log with its trunk.

The footage, recorded at Fort Worth Zoo in Texas, shows two elephants in an enclosure – one clutching a stick in its trunk while swinging it about.

Propping it up against a large log on the ground, the elephant lifts its leg and slowly begins to apply its weight to the centre point, hoping it will snap in two.

Stopping to reposition the stick, the elephant once against tramples down upon it, but despite the mammal's best efforts it merely slips from the log and onto the floor.

Looking slightly bent although still intact, the stick is once again picked up by the elephant's trunk and after twirling it around the mammal slams it down onto the log in a fit of rage.

Meanwhile the other elephant, who appears to be eating, looks on nonchalantly.

The elephant picks up the stick, skillfully props it up against the log on the ground and begins applying its weight to the centre point in the hope of snapping it in two

As the elephant tramples on the centre point of the stick it begins to bend but then slips down from the log

Frustrated at its failed attempts to break the stick in two the elephant picks it up in its trunk, twirls it around and throws it against the log

Youtube user johnbod, who uploaded the clip, noted that the other elephant appeared to be chewing on a piece of stick and believes that this was the reason for the elephant’s behaviour.

Fort Worth Zoo was founded in 1909 with one lion, an alligator,  a peacock, a coyote, two bear cubs and some rabbits.

Today the zoo is home to 5000 native and exotic animals and features Elephants in a section entitled Asian Falls, which was opened in 1992.
