When the talk turns to the greats of European football it is easy to rattle off the names of Paisley, Guardiola and Mourinho.

Last night, as his Real Madrid team contested the Super Cup with Sevilla, the most successful coach in Champions League history was taking it all in his stride.

Carlo Ancelotti is modest about his achievements after winning the Champions League twice with Milan and again last May with Real.

Quality: Carlo Ancelotti remains the most successful coach in Champions League history

Modest: Ancelotti remains a very level-headed individual despite all his success in the game

Assets: Ancelotti can call upon the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale at the Bernabeu

VIDEO Ronaldo double secures Super Cup

More than Mourinho’s two titles. More than Guardiola’s two with Barcelona. One more final than Paisley’s three. He knows there is pressure to deliver another, perhaps even more now that Los Blancos have added James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos to their stable.

They are, as they proved yet again last night, a phenomenal team. The trick is to manage them, to negotiate those tricky moments when he is asked about this player or that in the frenzy before Super Cup finals.

After naming Gareth Bale as the best player on the planet before this clash, he quickly added Sergio Ramos and Cristiano Ronaldo. He doesn’t want to upset anyone.

This dressing room is bulging with big names, superstars with enormous egos and worldwide acclaim from millions of supporters. They all want a slice of the action.

Ancelotti’s man-management skills are perhaps unequalled, and he is seemingly liked and respected in equal measure by his squad after he landed the Big One — La Decima — last May.

That thrilling night in Lisbon, when Real eventually dismantled Atletico Madrid and beat them 4-1, was his third Champions League triumph as a coach. He also won it twice as a player with Milan.

This is the man who was sacked by Chelsea in 2011 a year after winning the Double in his first season in English football.

Despite the success, Chelsea’s defeat against Mourinho’s Inter over two legs in the Champions League second round in 2010 was the beginning of the end.

This victory, confirmed by the brilliance of Cristiano Ronaldo and his two goals, adds to the aura of Ancelotti. 

He fended off a remarkable question about the possibility of him being sacked by Real president Florentino Perez if he fails to land La Liga this season.

Truth is, as club captain Iker Casillas explained, there is pressure to appear at Cibeles Square at the end of every season for the trophy parade.

Pedigree: Ancelotti has a fabulous record at both domestic and European level

Remember Mourinho had three cracks at the Champions League during his spell at the Bernabeu and failed to reach the final with this extraordinary squad.

Ancelotti is racking up the trophies, having won league titles in Italy, England and France. The challenge this season is to wrestle La Liga back from Atletico and fend off the inevitable threat of Barcelona when the domestic season gets under way on August 25.

Between now and then they have a two-legged Copa del Rey final against Atletico before the league opener at the Bernabeu against Cordoba.

Everywhere you look, they are competing for trophies and they will go deep into the Champions League again with this incredible front line rampaging across Europe.

Behind it all is the quiet man of continental football, making the subtle tweaks to his team as they chase honours at every turn.

Ronaldo remains the face of this football club, but Ancelotti is the brains behind it all.
