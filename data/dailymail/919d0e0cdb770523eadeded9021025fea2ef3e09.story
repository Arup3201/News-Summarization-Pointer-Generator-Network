The accusation thrown at Arsenal this season has been that they are a one-man team, that the goals of Alexis Sanchez have carried them so far.

Well, that’s not strictly true. Statistics reveal that the Gunners have the widest spread of goalscorers of any Premier League team this campaign.

While Sanchez has been a revelation at the Emirates since his summer move from Barcelona, scoring 18 goals, there have been 17 other different scorers for Arsene Wenger’s side.

Alexis Sanchez has scored 18 goals for Arsenal in his first season in English football 

Arsenal have been lucky enough to count of 18 different goalscorers throughout this season 

Sanchez, Giroud, Welbeck, Cazorla, Ramsey, Podolski, Koscielny, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rosicky, Ozil, Arteta, Chambers, Debuchy, Gibbs, Mertesacker, Sanogo, Walcott, Wilshere 

Compare that to beleaguered Aston Villa, who only record seven different players to have found the net.

But, somewhat surprisingly, it is Harry Redknapp’s Queens Park Rangers who hold the dubious honour of having the fewest amount of goal-getters this term at just six. Charlie Austin has scored 59 per cent of their goals.

Despite being lauded for their attacking play, Manchester United are in the bottom half in terms of personnel scoring, with only 10 different players having hit the back of the net. 

Sergio Aguero (here playing against Everton) is one of 15 different Manchester City scorers this term

Ayoze Perez is Newcastle United's top scorer but has only found the net five times 

Remarkably, Gabriel Agbonlahor is one of just seven different goalscorers for Aston Villa

Manchester City have 15 different scorers, which looks likely to be added to with the arrival of Wilfried Bony from Swansea City.

Tottenham have the same amount as Manuel Pellegrini’s title chasers, with Harry Kane grabbing the most. Remarkably, the young English striker has scored exactly double the amount of goals that Aston Villa have all together.

Goals have been spread evenly at St James’ park, with 14 different players scoring. Newcastle’s top scorer, Ayoze Perez, has only managed to score five times.
