A new-age guru to the stars is being sued by the mother of his child in a unique bid to secure a 'common law divorce' payout.

Simon Brown, who says that his teachings 'come from a place of love', is disputing the mother of his 16-year-old son’s right to a share of his wealth or the £500,000 home they shared for more than 15 years, despite her claim that they were 'man and wife' in all but a legal sense.

Mr Brown, who practices holistic health 
therapies and counts Boy George and Alicia Silverstone amongst his 
celebrity clients, is facing a High Court claim for half of his wealth 
from former partner Dragana Brown.

Court case: Macrobiotic chef Dragana Brown, left, is suing her former partner and the father of their child Simon Brown for half of his wealth in a unique bid to secure a common law divorce pay-out

This includes a 50 per cent share of his flat in Camden, West London, half the value of his collection of classic Jaguar cars and half the royalties for two of his books written since September 2010.

Although the couple share the same surname they are not married.

Ms Brown,a 48-year-old macrobiotic chef, co-authored a cookery book with Boy George about the diet which is based around grains, local vegetables, and avoiding animals products and processed foods, and is linked with the belief that food quality can affect health, happiness and well-being.

Famous followers of the diet are said to include actress and model Kelly Brook and singers Madonna and Sting.

She claims her guru partner told her that she 'need not worry' about their home being in his sole name 'as she was protected as a common law wife' should they split up.

However when the couple parted ways in 2008, after a 'serious and committed relationship' which lasted 15 years and produced a child, Mr Brown told his former partner that she had 'no legal or beneficial interest' in his flat, his cars or the books.

Ms Brown, originally from Kosovo, has now launched a High Court claim, asserting she is entitled to half shares in the property, the book royalties and the three Jaguars.

In documents filed at London’s High Court, Ms Brown’s barrister, Michael Glaser, set out her case and told how the former golden couple of the new age scene came to fall out over money.

'Although unmarried, the parties began living together as man and wife at the property when Ms Brown moved in on February 5, 1994. The reason for the delay in her moving in is that Mr Brown informed her that the timing and direction of her move had to be correct according to feng shui principles,' the barrister said.

'Although it was purchased in Mr Brown’s sole name in September 1993, it had always been the intention and understanding of the parties that it was to be their joint home,' he went on.

'Following the birth of their son, Ms Brown was concerned as to her position in relation to the property and any claims she may have against Mr Brown in the event that the parties were to separate.

'These concerns were raised with Mr Brown and the parties discussed their situation. Mr Brown said to her that she need not worry as she was protected as a common law wife.

'The parties agreed and understood this to mean that they both owned 50 per cent of the property and other assets they went on to purchase. This agreement and understanding was frequently repeated throughout the parties’ relationship,' he added.

'Ms Brown now understands that there is no legal concept known as a common law wife. In any event the agreement which they both made...was that she was entitled to one half of the property and other assets which they purchased during their relationship.

'She relied on this agreement - and the assurance given by Mr Brown to her - to her detriment,' the barrister said.

Mr Glaser went on to claim that Ms Brown was entitled to a share of the book royalties because she had 'edited them and co-authored the books' and that she had also made substantial payments towards the upkeep of the family home and the maintenance of the family whilst living there.

Ms Brown is also seeking an order that she and her son Michael be permitted to live in the contested flat until he has finished University.

Of this claim, Mr Glaser concluded: 'The property was purchased as a home for Ms Brown and Mr Brown and any children of the family. Although the relationship has since broken down, Ms Brown requires the property in order to provide a home for herself and the parties’ child.”

In his defence to the action, Mr Brown’s barrister, Morgan Sirikanda, denied that Ms Brown has any 'legal or beneficial interest' in the flat, the cars or the books, and denied feng shui had anything to do with the timing of her move into the property.

'It is expressly denied that the property was bought by Mr Brown with the intention that it would be a joint home for Ms Brown and himself,' he said.

'It is expressly and specifically denied that Mr Brown sought to assuage any concerns by representing to Ms Brown that she need not worry because she is his common law wife.

'Mr Brown has never described Ms Brown as a ‘common law wife’ either to her or to anyone else,' he went on.

'The
parties on occasion referred to themselves as ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ 
because they were in a serious and committed relationship which by 1996 
had produced a child,'he added.

'These
references have no connection to any understanding they had as to 
ownership of the property or any other asset,' the barrister states.

Mr Sirikanda also denied that Mr Brown’s former partner had edited or co-authored any of his books, or that she had the financial input into the home and family that she claims, adding: 'Mr Brown never assured or promised Ms Brown that his income was joint monies to be shared between them.'

In promotional material for his 
alternative therapies business, which at times has earned Mr Brown 
upwards of £90,000 a year and focuses on feng shui, macrobiotics and 
healing, the guru says: 'The words that best express my intentions are empathy, honesty, integrity, kindness, respect, dignity, understanding, care and gentleness...You will be listened to and heard in a way that is non-judgmental, open, considerate and caring.

'All our interactions come from a place of love.”

Dragana Brown said outside court: 'I don’t want to tarnish anybody’s name; I am just going to court to claim what I know is legally and morally mine.

'There are so many women who are under the illusion that there is such a thing as a common law wife - I was one such woman.

'I could walk away from this case with nothing, but I want to get it out there so other people know.”

She called for the law to be changed to give long-term partners similar property rights to married women calling it 'outdated.''
