Traffic was light this morning, but one little commuter was still in a bit of a rush.

Nassim Mohammed Elkarhat, was born at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel, at around 7am on Wednesday as parents Abdel and Soukaina rushed to a Brooklyn hospital.

Time ran out when Soukaina's labour pains intensified as they drove out of the underpass, on its Manhattan side, leaving husband Abdel no choice but to pull over and find help.

So Abdel, with the help of Port Authority Tunnel and Bridge Officer George McCann, delivered his firstborn as traffic whizzed past.

'I didn't know if I should stop inside the tunnel or just keep moving until I got out,' he said.

He kept moving, stopping at the tunnel exit to seek help.

Port Authority Tunnel and Bridge Officer George McCann, who is trained for emergency medical response, helped deliver the child.

'The father was really frantic,' Mr McCann told the New York Daily News.

A father of two children himself, the 52-year-old added: 'You could tell he was a new father. He was running around screaming, "Help me! Help me!"'

In a hurry: Nassim Mohammed Elkarhat, was born at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel, at around 7am on Wednesday as parents Abdel and Soukaina rushed to a Brooklyn hospital

Baby Nassim Mohammed Elkarhat and his mother were in good condition at New York Downtown Medical Center.

The Holland Tunnel runs under the Hudson River, connecting New York's Manhattan with Jersey City,  New Jersey, with around 34 million vehicles passing through it every year.
