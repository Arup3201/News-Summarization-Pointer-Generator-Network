A swimmer was feared dead when he disappeared after going for a dip - the latest tragedy of the summer heatwave.

The man, in his 20s, dived into a reservoir to try to cool off on one of the hottest days of the year.

But he disappeared in the water - sparking a large scale search and rescue operation in the reservoir in the Brecon Beacons in Mid Wales.

Police confirmed they were searching for a man in the Cantref Reservoir in the Brecon Beacons, Mid Wales.

The missing man is believed to be from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.

Hundreds of people have been around the reservoir as the heatwave continues. Police warned people to beware of swimming in unmanned water.

The weather reached new highs yesterday, the hottest day of the year.

Temperatures did not decrease by much today, with much of the country dealing with intense heat.

The rest of the week will see warm temperatures between the mid to high 20s, with the exception of Wednesday which is another contender for the hottest day of the year when temperatures could reach 32C (89.6F).

Health authorities have also urged the public to take care in the potentially 'dangerous' heat.

Elderly people are being warned to stay in the shade as much as possible and keep hydrated.

Level 2 alerts are triggered as soon as the Met Office forecasts that there is a 60 per cent chance of temperatures being high enough on at least two consecutive days to have a significant effect on health.
