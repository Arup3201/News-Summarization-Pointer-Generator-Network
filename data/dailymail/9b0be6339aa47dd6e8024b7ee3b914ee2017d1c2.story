Home Secretary  Theresa May defended the decision to terminate the eBorders contract with US firm Raytheon Systems - despite being ordered to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in damages

Taxpayers were last night landed with a £500million bill for the ‘catastrophic’ IT project intended to protect our borders.

An arbitration tribunal ruled the way the Home Office had terminated the contract for the shambolic eBorders scheme was unlawful.

Defence firm Raytheon will now pocket £223million of public money, including £50million in damages.

The settlement is in addition to the £260million the Government had spent by the time Raytheon was fired in July 2010 with the journey-logging system in disarray. Legal fees are expected to push the final bill to half a billion pounds.

The contract debacle sparked new questions about the performance of Lin Homer, who was paid £200,000 a year to run the UK Border Agency from 2005 to 2011. She was in charge of her officials’ disastrous management of the eBorders project, and presided over a string of other blunders.

But, despite fierce criticism from MPs over her record, Miss Homer has been promoted to the post of chief executive of the HMRC.

Her time in charge of UKBA will now be the subject of up to four different inquiries, including a new hearing by the home affairs select committee of the Commons. Keith Vaz, the commitee’s Labour chairman, said last night: ‘This is a catastrophic result.

‘It is now clear that the UKBA didn’t know what they wanted from the eBorders programme.

‘We will want to hear further from Lin Homer, the then head of the UKBA, as to why she sanctioned such a defective agreement.’

The project was initiated by Labour but was poorly managed by officials from the start, and hit by a series of delays.

It was eventually axed in July 2010 by Home Secretary Theresa May when, acting on advice from officials, it was deemed impossible to salvage. However, the process that the now defunct UK Border Agency used when reaching a decision to scrap the agreement was flawed according to the Arbitration Tribunal, which settles global contract disputes.

Labour's Home Affairs Select Committee chair Keith Vaz said the tribunal's decision was 'catastrophic' for the Government

The Treasury is expected to step in to pick up much of the bill to minimise the ‘impact on frontline services’.

In a letter, Mrs May said: ‘The Government stands by the decision to end the eBorders contract with Raytheon. All other alternatives available to the Government would have led to greater costs than the result of this tribunal ruling.’

Despite its own role in the shambles, Labour last night criticised the Government’s handling of the contracts. The party’s Home Office spokesman David Hanson said: ‘This is a crushing verdict. As a result of this stalled process, we are still far away from counting people in and out of the UK.’
