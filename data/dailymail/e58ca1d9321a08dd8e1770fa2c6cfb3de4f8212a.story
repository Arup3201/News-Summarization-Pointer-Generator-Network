MailOnline has now confirmed that Alec Baldwin has been nixed from the MSNBC lineup following the scandal surrounding his homophobic insults and run-ins with multiple photographers.

Hours after the news broke, Baldwin took time out of filming a movie in Hawaii to tell his side of the story- and place at least a portion of the blame on gay rights advocates who he argues used him as a scapegoat.

The scandal erupted earlier this month when he was videotaped using a homophobic slur towards a photographer outside of his apartment. Though recordings of the events make it appear that he called the man a 'c********** f**,' Baldwin has maintained that he said 'c********** fathead'. He has since apologized for saying the first half of the slur, claiming he did not know that it was derogative towards homosexuals.

'If I called him 'cocksucking maggot' or a 'c********** motherf*****'... 'f*****' is not the word that came out of my mouth. That I know,' Baldwin told local blog Gothamist by phone on Tuesday evening.

'But you've got the fundamentalist wing of gay advocacy—Rich Ferraro and Andrew Sullivan—they're out there, they've got you. Rich Ferraro, this is probably one of his greatest triumphs.

Off the air: Alec Baldwin's show on MSNBC was cancelled following a series of public clashes with photographers

'They killed my show. And I have to take some responsibility for that myself.'

Baldwin's decision to point to 
Ferraro, a spokesman for GLAAD, in the interview comes as a bit of a 
surprise since he previously announced via Twitter that Ferraro was the 
one who called Baldwin after the incident to explain that 'c**********' 
was a slur.

He removed 
the Tweet shortly after posting it, but MailOnline screen-grabbed it and
 it reads: '1-Rich Ferraro from @glaad informs me that c'sucker is an 
anti-gay epithet. In which case I apologize and will retire it from my 
vocabulary.'

'2- you learn something new every day.'

Both
 of the men that Baldwin mentioned by name condemned Baldwin publicly, 
with Ferraro issuing the statement from GLAAD and blogger Andrew 
Sullivan writing a lengthy article on his well-read political blog 
calling for his show to be taken off the air.

Naming names: Baldwin specifically cited GLAAD's Rich Ferraro (left) and blogger Andrew Sullivan (right) as two members of the 'fundamentalist wing of gay advocacy' who had him fired

Called out: GLAAD publicly chastised Baldwin shortly after the incident for his homophobic language - the second time the group has intervened with him this year

Pleading ignorance: Baldwin offered up an apology in the days after the altercation and this excuse after GLAAD criticized his use of language- which he Tweeted but deleted shortly after

Baldwin went on to compare himself to
 MSNBC's other controversial host, Martin Bashir, who is also facing 
calls for his resignation after suggesting on-air that something 
horrific should be done to former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin. MSNBC 
has not made any statements about the fate of Bashir's show but the host
 apologized to Palin and she accepted it.

Bringing him into it: Baldwin cited the fact that MSNBC has not fired Martin Bashir for making highly inappropriate comments about Sarah Palin

'Martin Bashir's on the air, and he made his comment on the air! I dispute half the comment I made...' Baldwin told Gothamist. 

'There's
 nothing you can do when you get thrown in this washing machine, 
nothing. You know? Nothing. All you end up doing is just defending 
yourself all day long.'

The
 actor's late night talk show 'Up Late With Alec Baldwin' was 
originally suspended for two weeks immediately following his argument 
with photographers and journalists outside of his New York City 
apartment.

In a pseudo 'mea
 culpa' that the actor wrote following his earlier two episode 
suspension that preceded the announcement of his show's cancellation, 
Baldwin hinted that it may be taken off the air permanently.

An employee at MSNBC has confirmed to MailOnline on Tuesday that the star's nascent show has been officially cancelled.

The New York Post first spoke with the Golden 
Globe-winning actor's spokesman who reportedly took issue with the word 
'fired' but did confirm that the show will no longer be on the air.

Cryptic: Alec Baldwin retweeted this Nelson Mandela quote just three hours before the news broke

Supportive: Baldwin's wife Hilaria put up this inspirational message Tuesday evening

'The show is not coming back. He had questions on whether he wanted to continue,' the spokesman said.

Not long after their article was published, Baldwin's spokesman Matthew Hiltzik and MSNBC issued a joint statement to The Huffington Post.

'We are jointly confirming that UP LATE will not continue on MSNBC,' the network said in the statement.

'This is a mutual parting and we wish Alec all the best.'

'The decision has been made. He’s gone,' a different unidentified insider told The Post.

'The (parent company) Comcast guys have decided. Word is spreading through the building.' 

Hours before speaking to Gothamist- which is where he last went to explain himself after getting into an online Twitter rage against a MailOnline journalist- the actor retweeted an inspirational quote from 
Nelson Mandela just hours before the news about the MSNBC decision broke
 on Tuesday afternoon.

'There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to dispair,' the post read.

Confrontation: The reporters were outside his apartment earlier this month following his appearance in court when he testified against his stalker

Apparently his use of a slur was not 
the only reason why Comcast decided to cut the program.

Even before the show was suspended following the run-in with the photographer, it was already struggling.

The ratings for the show's fifth week were down 40 per cent from the premiere audience and dropped to 395,000 total viewers.

The reportedly had difficulty booking guests, as Terms Of Endearment actress Debra Winger and fellow MSNBC host Chris Matthews were the two biggest names who appeared on the short-lived program.

The inside sources also claimed that Baldwin was overly demanding behind the scenes and said that he required a personal humidifier and his own make up room because a woman who he would have been sharing it with has cancer and a sensitivity to hairspray. 

'I don’t give a f*** if she has cancer or not, I want that f****** makeup room,' he allegedly screamed.

When the temporary suspension was announced on November 15, Baldwin hinted that it may not return.

'Whether the show comes back at all is at issue right now,' he wrote in an essay published on The Huffington Post.

'If quitting the television business, 
the movie business, the theater, any component of entertainment, is 
necessary in order to bring safety and peace to my family, then that is 
an easy choice.' 

Though he may have been down at that point after having three separate arguments with reporters and photographers in the span of one day, it didn't stop him from taking pot-shots at the competition in the blog post.

Off the air: Baldwin's show was first suspended for two weeks and then cut from the lineup entirely

'If the show dies, its fate ends up being no different than the vast majority of start-up TV programming, and so be it. We do take a small amount of pride in knowing that we beat CNN in the ratings each of our nights. (I forget who they had on at that time.)'

'I have been a fan of MSNBC for some time. Its left-leaning tone never bothered me. I still believe that they are more enamored of and devoted to the truth in any single hour than Fox is all year long.'

In a note that seems like he knew trouble was brewing, he did say that a cancellation of his program may help fellow MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who he called the 'single most important television journalist on the air today'.

'If my show does disappear, I will be grateful in so far as her good work, along with that of (Lawrence) O'Donnell and (Chris) Hayes and (Al) Sharpton and (Chris) Matthews and (Chris) Jansing, will not be sullied by my problem,' he wrote.

The series of incidents this month were just the latest in a string of violent and homophobic altercations that Baldwin has been a part of over the years.
