On trial: Brenda Christine White faces charges of attempted murder and criminal mischief stemming from the 2006 incident

The attorney of a Utah woman charged with ramming an SUV through an office building to hit her estranged husband says she was on a large amount of anxiety medication and was 'not in her right mind.'

The argument came as a part of the trial against Brenda Christine White, the 36-year-old woman who has gone through a series of rejected appeals before being brought to court in Taylorsville.

Authorities said White hit her ex-husband twice with her Ford Explorer after crashing through the office building in Salt Lake County.

'On that day, Brenda White's body was behind the wheel of that Ford Explorer,' Attorney Jason Schatz said.

'What's in dispute is why this happened.'

The incident happened in 2006 but there have been several appeals because her defense attorneys have tried to use the defense that White was under extreme emotional distress.

Lawyers argue that she had taken too much Xanax which also was partially to blame for the incident.

The Salt Lake Tribune reports that White faces charges of attempted murder and criminal mischief. The trial is scheduled to last through Thursday in 3rd District Court in Salt Lake City.

The womanâ€™s ex, Jon Robert White, said he initially ran from a parking garage when he saw his ex-wife in the SUV.

Long process: White's attorneys have pushed for appeals over the past six years, arguing that she was 'not in her right mind' because she had taken too much Xanax before the attack

He said he ran between two parked cars, jumped over a concrete wall, and into an office, before his ex-wife crashed through the glass doors and hit him.

After being hit, he was still able to get up and continue to run but she drove down a hallway and chased him, hitting him again.

He said he hid in a closet until a maintenance man found him.

Brenda White's attorneys say she did not intend to kill her ex-husband. Mr Schatz said she suffered from panic attacks and anxiety and on that day she had taken a lot of medication.

'At some point in our lives we have all done or said something that we wouldn't have done if we were in total control of our body,' Mr Schatz said.
