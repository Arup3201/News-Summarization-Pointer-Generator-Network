Star Wars fans have been auditioning for two lead roles in the latest Episode of the franchise in Bristol today.

She was joined by thousands of other amateur actors from 4.30am outside the Arnolfi arts centre, with auditions not starting until six and a half hours later.

Auditions for two roles in the latest Star Wars movie took place in Bristol today, with one girl queuing from 2pm on Friday to be the first in. Here another girl dresses up as Princess Leia in the hope it might convince the panel

Despite the pouring rain hundreds of young people turned out for a chance to play either 'Thomas' or 'Rachel' in Episode 7

The female lead was been described as 'street smart and strong' and 'always a survivor, never a victim' on the casting sheet, while the male has 'grown up without a father's influence' but is 'smart, capable and shows courage when it is needed.'

Disney, who are producing Episode 7, are 
auditioning for two 'athletic and attractive' lead roles, one girl in 
her late teens and another man in his late teens or early 20s.

Jasmine Du'Pre, an actress, was the first in line and for her chance to play 'Rachel', a 'street smart and strong' girl who is 'always a survivor, never a victim.'

She said: 'I had the most amazing experience at my Star Wars audition. I was first in line and it was worth the wait'

One amateur actor Colin Powers tweeted that he had queued for four hours in his bid for fame

Yesterday JJ Abrams, the director of the latest Star Wars franchise, was announced as the screenwriter

Bristol is just the first venue for a 
casting call that will visit Glasgow, Manchester, Dublin and London 
before heading to Nashville and Chicago in the US.

Meanwhile Colin Powers, hoping to play 
'Thomas', who has 'grown up without a father's influence' but is 'smart,
capable and shows courage when it is needed', tweeted: 'After leaving 
at 5:40, arriving at 7:30, queuing until 11:30 and finally finished the 
#starwarsaudition'

J.J. Abrams, the director of the Star Trek films, is penning the new Star Wars movie with Empire Strikes Back writer Lawrence Kasdan

At midday Sara Adele Diaz was still waiting for her chance and added: 'Still in queue. Feet are freezing I can't feel them.'

Yesterday it was announced that JJ Abrams, the director of the vaunted Star Trek franchise starring Chris Pine, has agreed to write a script.

The film will go into production next year at Pinewood Studios and a release date has also been set for Christmas 2015.

The latest edition will carry on chronologically from where the original 1970s franchise left off, with the death of the Imperial ruler Emperor Palpatine and Sith Lord Darth Vader, and the destruction of the second death star.

The three icons of the original movies - Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher - are expected to make a comeback.

Disney will be behind the latest offering after buying Lucasarts, George Lucas' production company, for $4billion (Â£2.7bn) in October last year.

That development made some die-hard fans nervous, fearing that the films will be mellowed out to appeal to a younger audience, however Abrams has allayed some of them by hinting that his script, being penned with Empire Strikes Back writer Lawrence Kasdan, will return to the gritty and mysterious style of the original trilogy.
