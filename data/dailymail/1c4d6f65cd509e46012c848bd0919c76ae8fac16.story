Exorbitant: Stephen Kavanagh, currently deputy assistant commissioner in the Met Police, will earn £192,000-a-year when he becomes the new Essex Police Chief Constable

A chief constable is set to earn nearly £200,000-a-year, despite swingeing cuts to police forces across the country.

Stephen
Kavanagh, the incoming chief constable in Essex, will rake in £192,000 –
more than ten times the starting salary of a new recruit.

He will earn £17,500 more than his predecessor, despite the force having to find £44 million a year in savings, after Whitehall slashed policing budgets by 20 per cent.

His salary, £50,000 more than the prime minister, and nearly three times more than the average MP, has provoked strong criticism from taxpayer groups.

The TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Matthew Sinclair said: ‘Such a huge increase in pay for the role is impossible to justify when families struggle to make ends meet and rank and file officers see their pay frozen.

‘This appears to be case of one rule for a fortunate few and a totally different one for everyone else.’

January, Theresa May announced the starting salaries of new constables would be cut from £23,000 to £19,000.

But
the Essex Police and Crime Commissioner Nick Alston, who hired Mr 
Kavanagh – currently deputy assistant commissioner in the Met Police – 
has defended the enormous salary.

‘During the selection process, Stephen's passion to lead Essex Police for a full four years and to serve the people of Essex was crystal clear,’ said Mr Alston, who was elected to his position in November.

‘We had an outstanding field of candidates, of whom Stephen was the very best.

‘Therefore, I have decided to use the discretion given to me under the legislation to ensure that Stephen is remunerated at the top end of the agreed national range.

Savings: Essex Police and Crime commissioner Nick Alston has defended the savings, while Home Secretary Theresa May announced in January that the salary of new police recruits would be dropped to £19,000

‘Essex Police is one of the largest employers in Essex, and I find it hard to imagine a more important job than keeping us all safe.’

But if Mr Kavanagh’s salary wasn’t enough, his pay package also includes a housing allowance, which is given to officers who joined the police before September 1994.

Under new police pay regulations, signed off by Home Secretary Theresa May, police and crime commissioners are allowed to increase the starting salaries of incoming Chief Constables by up to ten per cent.

Mr Alston, acknowledged, however, that the Mr Kavanagh’s salary could rile rank and file officers who have seen their pay frozen and the salaries of newly recruited constables slashed.

He added: ‘I'm sure there will be some concerns about it.

‘But what I want to explain to officers is that they need a good leader to take them forward who is interested in their work and is committed to keeping Essex safe.’

Conservative MP Simon Burns, an Essex MP, told the MailOnline: 'I’m disappointed that the salary is not only more than the previous incumbent’s salary but also more than the prime minister of this country.

'In a time of austerity it does seem a little perplexing that the new Chief Constable of Essex should be getting such a generous salary.'

Stephen Kavanagh was born in Basildon, Essex, and will join the county’s force from a high profile role in the Metropolitan Police, where he started as a constable in 1985.

In 1998, he took on the role of Homicide Senior Investigating Officer for East London, leading on 50 murder investigations.

He is currently deputy assistant commissioner in London and he played leading roles in the wake of the 7/7 bombings, the phone hacking probe and the riots in 2011.

In the past he has also been in charge of protecting the Royal family and the Palaces of Westminster.

He is a real ‘Essex Boy’, who grew up in Clacton, Colchester, Chelmsford and Tolleshunt D'Arcy – all in the county.

He lives in Essex, with his wife and their teenage son.
