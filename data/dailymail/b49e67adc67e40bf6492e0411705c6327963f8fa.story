Liberal Democrats have triggered fury by vowing to overturn David Cameron’s plans for internet porn filters.

Child safety experts and MPs called the move ‘irresponsible’ and warned it would undermine attempts to protect children from hardcore pornography.

Lib Dem party president Tim Farron said the Government should enshrine the ‘digital rights of the citizen’ and halt requirement for ‘filters, lists or controls on legal material’.

Mr Farron said filters were ‘misconceived, ineffective and illiberal’. A motion set to be adopted at the party’s spring conference will say ‘families and individuals should decide how they wish to use them’.

He warned ‘essential sites’ on sex education and gay rights were being blocked, while porn was slipping through filters.

‘Our motion is designed to strengthen Lib Dem ministers’ hands in challenging this nonsensical policy, which has yet to be brought before the House of Commons,’ he said.

‘If the Prime Minister really wanted to protect children from inappropriate material, he’d ensure they had access to good sexual health and relationship education.’

John Carr, of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, accused Lib Dems of rushing to judgement.

He said: ‘When the Lib Dems say they do not want internet service providers to make it easier to use filters, what are they saying to parents?

‘Filters are not perfect but they can help busy parents keep some of the most awful stuff away from their children’s machines.’

Mr Carr said internet providers plan to spend £25million on a public awareness campaign to explain how filters work.

Conservative MP Julian Smith said: ‘Tim Farron is clearly putting his Lib Dem leadership ambitions ahead of our children’s protection.

‘Instead of looking ahead to 2015 and pandering to the loony left in his party, he should be . . . prioritising the safety of children online.’

Culture Secretary Maria Miller is in charge of the policy which is under review at the moment

Laura Perrins, of Mothers At Home Matter, said: ‘Online filters are one tool in helping protect families but no one  is pretending that they are  a panacea.’

Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman, said: ‘It’s typically irresponsible of the Liberal Democrats to oppose this protection.

‘It is important our children are protected from 18-rated material. That should not include gay helplines or normal sex education websites but if anything the initial problems strengthen my belief that we need one unified standard and filtering system.’

Labour has pledged to bring in mandatory filters if the coalition’s voluntary approach is found to have failed.

The party wants all filters to abide by British Board of Film Classification ratings.

A Tory source said: ‘It is bizarre that the Lib Dems have decided protecting children online is no longer important.

‘But luckily the Tories do and a Tory Secretary of State [Culture Secretary Maria Miller] is in charge of this policy.’

Miranda Suit, of Safer Media, which campaigned for a block on online porn, said: ‘Everyone knew there could be teething problems but to ditch the entire policy seems entirely disproportionate.’

A Lib Dem party spokesman said Mr Farron’s intervention ‘is not agreed party policy’.

He pointed out Lib Dem Baroness Benjamin had called for tougher controls on porn.
