The 14-year-old student who severely beat a Missouri sixth-grader with Asperger's syndrome will be taken into custody by the state's youth services division for treatment. The teen, whose name has not been released, admitted to striking Blake Kitchen (above), 12, in their school's lunchroom last month

In the February 19 attack, Blake (above) was knocked unconscious and suffered from a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School 

'They can pretty much tailor a program to each individual kid based on their needs,' said Janet Rogers, interim juvenile officer for Clay County. 

'Their goal is to get these kids turned around so they can make better choices before they hit adulthood.'

In the February 19 attack, Blake was knocked unconscious and suffered from a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School.

Blake has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. 

His parents said that turned troublesome when last month, a boy moved Blake's belongings from his seat. When Blake asked the boy to move, another boy began hitting him.

'Then I blacked out,' Blake told WDAF. 'My ear hurts, my jaw hurts, my back hurts and that's all.'

Blake's mother, Destiny, said the boy continued to beat her son even after he had blacked out, but she said luckily he does not remember the attack, according to Fox2Now. 

'He doesn't remember any of that. I guess that was a blessing. He was unconscious and doesn't remember being violently attacked. It's sad he didn't stop,' she said.

'Anytime they moved him he would vomit. Dry heaving constantly, just dry heaving. Him crying and saying it was so painful and he was afraid he was going to die. He was like 'I don't want to die'.' 

Blake spent five days at Children's Mercy Hospital and was later released. 

His injuries have left him facing a second surgery and he is still unable to return to school but is trying to keep up online.

Prior to the incident, Blake's parents  sent a certified letter to the school's principal  complaining about the same boy bullying Blake's older brother.

Programs have been put in place following the incident to address bullies and other serious issues, Liberty superintendent Jeremy Tucker (above) announced on Thursday

'It could have been avoided,' said Destiny.

She said that she hopes the teen gets the help that he needs so that he does not harm anyone else.

The eighth grader was arrested and referred to juvenile court following the incident, said Liberty police Capt. Andy Hedrick. At the time of the hearing on Thursday, he was still in juvenile custody.

During the proceeding, the teen's lawyer, Gregory Culotta, said the boy and his family are very sorry for what happened, according to KMBC.

He also mentioned that his client suffered at the hands of some bullying himself for nearly a year at school and on the bus.

Culotta also disputed that there was ongoing bullying evident with the boy against Blake and his siblings.
