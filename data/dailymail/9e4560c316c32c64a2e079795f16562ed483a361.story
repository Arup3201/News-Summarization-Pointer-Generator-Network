Friends: Kirstine Hamilton, who has a ten-year-old daughter with former partner Neil Trotter

The ex-girlfriend of lottery winner Neil Trotter may have missed out on his fortune, but is still happy after finding love with the man two doors down.

Kirstine Hamilton, who lived with Mr Trotter at number 29, stayed at the address after she split with mechanic Neil ten years ago.

She soon struck up a friendship with Michael Hamilton, who lived in number 27 - just two doors down, the Sun reports. 

The friendship turned to love and now she and Mr Hamilton, who is said to work for F1 mogul Bernie Ecclestone, are married and enjoying their honeymoon in Cancun, Mexico.

But despite her ex-boyfriend's new found fortune, Mrs Hamilton has taken news of his £108million win in good humour, and is said to be 'over the moon' for Mr Trotter.

The pair, from Coulsdon, Surrey, who have a ten-year-old daughter together, are said to remain on good terms despite their split several years ago.

Mr
 Trotter said that he planned to use his fortune to buy 
country mansions, sports  cars and designer handbags for his new 
girlfriend.

But he appeared 
amused when asked if he would be buying his ex-girlfriend a house – and 
explained that she and her husband were rich enough already.

He
 said: ‘She’s just married. He’s in Formula 1. I think he’s in charge of
 all the radios and things like that for Bernie Ecclestone. They are 
well off and live just up the road from me.

‘Her mum texted her. She was pleased – she said, “That’s just typical of you, Trotter.”’

Mrs
 Hamilton, who will turn 41 at the weekend, attended Purley High School 
for Girls in South London, close to where her ex-boyfriend went to 
school.

The couple are 
believed to have broken up not long after their daughter Annabelle was 
born, and Mr Trotter has been with his new partner Nicky Ottaway, 33, 
for eight years.

Mr Trotter bought £10 worth of Lucky Dip tickets on Friday after getting a 'funny feeling' that he had to play while on the drive to work

Pictures posted on Mrs 
Hamilton’s Facebook page last month show her in a white wedding dress 
and kissing her new husband, in full morning dress, surrounded by their 
friends and family.

Another picture, apparently from later that evening, shows her in a blue dress clutching a celebratory glass of champagne.
