A family who were holidaying on an island off the Scottish coast used their luggage straps to save 19 stranded dolphins.

Finlay Meakin, 13, spotted the pod of dolphins swimming unusually close the shore at the seculded resort of Lochbuie on the Isle of Mull.

He called for help when it became clear the animals had become stuck in shallow water after chasing a school of mackerel toward the beach.

His uncle Simon Lane, 59, and mother Madge Meakin, 48, ran down to the shore, before immediately wading into the sea in a bid to help the 'mass stranding'.

The family then spent two hours slowly moving the dolphins, weighing between 35lbs and 200lbs each, back into deeper water.

Incredibly, they even used their suitcase luggage straps to help lift the heavier animals and push them to safety.

Video footage taken by Finley shows Mr Lane, from Hickling, Nottinghamshire, wading into the shallow water, before helping the stressed dolphins.

Due to the family's brave rescue efforts, the dolphins were able to swim to deeper water unharmed.

The beaching on July 24 was the worst case seen in the UK since 2008, when 26 dolphins died after becoming stranded in Cornwall, according to the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust.

Yesterday, Mr Lane said he was forced to carry the dolphins out to water that was up to his neck so they could swim to safety.

'On the day, we were in the house which overlooks the bay and we saw them chasing mackerel, but to our astonishment they were all beached,' said the grandfather of one.

'It was only about 100 yards away, I had never seen anything like it before. We ran down to see what we could do and they were beached about 20 yards from the sands and seemed very distressed.

'I went in and tried to get them out but they kept coming back in. With some of the bigger ones we had to get a strap and put it under them and lift them.

'We had to move them into the deeper water and hold them under using this strap so they could get their sat-nav sorted. At its eepest, the water was up to my shoulders and neck.'

Ms Meakin, 48, added: 'Simon was definitely the hero. We just couldn’t believe what had happened.'

Mr Lane was on a two-week holiday in Scotland with his partner Sue Meakin, 60, her sister Madge and her husband Jim, 58, and their son Finley when they spotted the stranded dolphins.

He said the family have rented the house on the Isle of Mull for ten years but have never had to act as heroes before.

'We go up there regularly, and rent the house that overlooks the bay. It is very remote, there isn’t much out there,' he said.

'It will probably never happen again. I do a lot of snorkelling and have swam with seals before but I have never had any dealings with dolphins.

'Hero': Mr Lane said he was forced to carry the dolphins out to water that was up to his neck so that they could swim to safety

'I wasn’t sure what they would be like, they were obviously stressed and you could hear them squeaking very loudly.

'They must have been talking to each other but they seemed to know what we were doing and that we wanted to help them.

'It was pretty exhausting but we were all so relieved to know the dolphins were safe.'

The Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, which is based an hour-and-half’s drive from the loch, today  praised the family’s rescue efforts.

Sighting and strandings officer Conor Ryan, 28, said: 'It was a really unusual event and the family did everything right.

'It was in a very isolated place, so it was very lucky that the family spotted them.'

Mr Ryan also described the 'mass stranding' at Lochbuie as unusual, saying: 'Common dolphins normally live in deeper waters, so they don’t tend to get beached.

'Between 100 and 150 dolphins had been going through the waters nearby at that time. The dolphins that became beached were part of a splinter group.

'It’s that time of year when they move a bit closer to the shore, possibly for fish, and the mackerel come right in close to the beach.'

He added: 'A "mass stranding" means that more than two individuals have been affected. The last one of this scale was in Cornwall in June 2008 when 26 dolphins became beached.'

During the 2008 incident, the entire pod of dolphins died after becoming stranded near St Mawes in Cornwall.

Veterinary wildlife pathologist Vic Simpson, who examined the 
bodies, said the animals had died after they inhaled debris and mud that 
clogged their insides.

He added that the scenes in the River Percuil looked like 'some sort of mass suicide'.
