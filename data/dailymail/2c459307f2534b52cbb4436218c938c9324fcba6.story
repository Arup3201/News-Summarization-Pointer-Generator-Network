These are the first pictures of Simon Huxtable and  Deborah Dale, the British couple crushed by a drunk driver in Bruges.

The pair had been taking a stroll on New Year’s Day when they were hit by a speeding  Mercedes going the wrong way down a one-way street.

Miss Dale, 34, and Mr Huxtable, 44, were badly injured when the car pinned them to a wall, crushing their legs.

Injured: Simon Huxtable, 44, and Deborah Dale, 34, were crushed by a car while on a romantic holiday in Bruges

The couple, from Witney, Oxfordshire, were in the city for a romantic New Year break, and had been staying in the heart of Old Bruges.

They remain in the city’s Sint Jan Hospital, where doctors are fighting to save their legs.

A source close to Miss Dale’s family yesterday corrected a statement by Belgian police, who said medics had been forced to amputate both her legs in an emergency operation.

The source told the Daily Mail: ‘Miss Dale has been seriously injured but doctors have not had to amputate her legs.

‘She has suffered serious injuries and she is continuing to receive treatment for these injuries in hospital.’ The original police statement said: ‘The woman had to have both of her legs amputated.

‘The man also suffered bad injuries. One of his legs was very badly injured but doctors have been working to save them.’

The couple’s parents rushed to Belgium after learning of the accident, and remain at their hospital bedsides. Foreign Office officials also are providing assistance.

Scene of horror: The Mercedes stands in the cobbled street where Deborah Dale and Simon Huxtable were crushed

Mr Huxtable, from Witney, Oxfordshire, had travelled to the historic Belgian city for a romantic New Year break with Miss Dale

'There was blood everywhere. The lady’s legs were completely crushed.’

The driver, a 22-year-old local man 
who has not been identified, had been at an all-night New Year’s Eve 
party in the city centre before the accident, which happened at 10.30am.

He failed to stop the Mercedes C320 
saloon at a T-junction and ploughed straight into the couple, who were 
walking along the cobbled streets past historic Flemish houses in the 
Old Town.

The heavy car pinned the couple against the wall of a house, causing horrific crush injuries.

The driver, who police believe had 
been speeding, was breathalysed at the scene and arrested for driving 
while over the alcohol limit.

He was banned from driving for 15 days
and released without further sanction. A magistrate will decide in the 
coming months whether to bring any further charges.

Last night Miss Dale’s ex-partner Kevin Ruxton branded the Belgian criminal justice system ‘disgusting’.

Mr Ruxton, a computer engineer from 
West London, said: ‘It’s up to a judge to decide if this drunk 
22-year-old gets any kind of sentence, I think that is preposterous. It 
seems too lenient.’

He added: ‘They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. We are still in shock.’

Yesterday a spokesman for the Belgian 
police said the couple remained in a serious condition. ‘There is a 
possibility that they may both have to have either one or even both legs
amputated,’ he added.

Sister
Emmanuelle, a Catholic nun who witnessed the horrific scene, said: ‘I 
heard a big bang and then I heard loud screaming. There were two people 
lying on the ground screaming and waving their arms wildly. It was 
terrible.

‘The people were screaming and screaming and shouting out in English. I tried to reassure them but I cannot speak English.

‘The driver got out of the car and asked
someone to call an ambulance. People were coming out of their houses 
because of the noise

‘Finally the injured people fell silent and stopped screaming. After what seemed like a long time the police and the ambulance arrived.

‘I have not been able to sleep since. I can still hear them screaming.'

A retired doctor, who lives next to the crash site, administered first aid on the couple while they waited for the ambulance.

Witness Marleen Broeckeart said: ‘There was blood everywhere. The lady’s legs were completely crushed.’

A police spokesman told the Daily Mail: ‘The driver is a local man. He had borrowed his sister’s car to come to Bruges for a New Year’s Eve party.

‘The next day he was driving the wrong way along a small street in the centre of Bruges.

‘He was meant to turn at a T-junction but he went straight on and drove into the British tourists who were walking along the footpath.

'The Mercedes is a very heavy car and it pinned them against the front of a house and they were badly hurt.

‘The driver said he had been drinking and officers found he was over the legal limit.

‘He was arrested and he was banned from driving for 15 days, which is the normal procedure. A magistrate will decide in the next couple of months if there will be any further charges.’

Popular: The historic city of Bruges attracts thousands of British tourists every year

Miss Dale’s parents, Roger and Diana, were at their daughter’s bedside at the Sint Jan Hospital in Bruges.

A hospital spokesman said: ‘They are very upset. They don’t want to talk about what has happened to their daughter. It is against hospital policy to discuss the medical condition of patients with journalists.’

Bruges, which dates from the 12th century and is a UNESCO world heritage site, is a popular holiday destination attracting tens of thousands of Britons every year.

The small Old Town is characterised by its winding cobbled streets, meandering canals and pretty squares surrounded by distinct Flemish red-brick houses.

However behind the picturesque architecture is a rich commercial history – Bruges was an important trading centre throughout the Middle Ages.
