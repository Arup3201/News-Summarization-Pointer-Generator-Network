Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League and Football League fixtures. 

1. Arsenal’s problems keeping the ball at Anfield began from the back where goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who normally likes to roll the ball out to a defender to start play, was forced to kick it long.

He launched all but two of 33 passes into Liverpool’s half – so not surprising that barely a third of them reached another Arsenal player.

It set an uncharacteristic tone for the Gunners. Their total of just 36.5 per cent possession was the lowest total recorded by an Arsene Wenger side in a Premier League game since records began in 2003.

2. Nobody works harder for a team than James Milner, even when he is asked to play out of position.

The England midfielder responded to Manuel Pellegrini’s request to play at centre forward by making more sprints (71) than any other Manchester City player, and covering more miles (6.7) in his 82 minutes than all but Jesus Navas managed in 90.

For good measure he set up Yaya Toure for the third goal and made two other chances in the 3-0 win over Palace.

3. Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan has added a confidence coming off his line to his shot-stopping.

The USA international made eight saves to help end Manchester United’s six-game winning run, but it was his willingness to catch crosses that made the biggest contribution as ten-man Villa held on to a 1-1 draw.

Guzan used his 6ft 4ins frame to come out and make six catches in all – more than any other Premier League keeper this weekend.

4. Will Buckley showed his determination to force his way back into Gus Poyet’s starting team with a match turning nine minutes after coming on for Sunderland at Newcastle.

The 25-year-old, who followed Poyet from Brighton in the summer for just £2.5million, sprinted the length of the field to set up Adam Johnson’s dramatic winner seconds after heading away a corner on his own six yard box.

He ran a remarkable 1.5 miles during his brief time on the pitch – and set up three other chances as well as the winning goal.

5. Nigel Pearson can be a gambler if he’s chasing a game – he used all three subs at the same time with nearly half an hour left shortly after Stewart Downing had scored West Ham’s second goal.

It’s the second time since bringing Leicester into the Premier League that he’s risked leaving himself with ten men if anybody gets injured. He did the same thing when his side were 2-0 down with 22 minutes to go at Swansea in October.

Sadly for Pearson his boldness failed to change the game both times. On each occasion the Foxes went on to lose 2-0.

6. Kyle Walker’s return from the abdominal injury that had kept him out since early March has added an extra attacking threat to Tottenham’s back four.

The 24-year-old England full back played more accurate passes in Burnley’s half than any other Spurs defender in the 2-1 win over Burnley as Mauricio Pochettino’s side stretched their recent run to 16 points from eight games.

Walker has recovered his pace since undergoing surgery, too. He recorded the quickest average speed of any Tottenham player.

7. Swansea’s Garry Monk is still a relative rookie after less than a year as a Premier League boss but he’s not afraid to take big decisions.

He made seven changes to the team that had unluckily lost to Spurs a week earlier – including dropping top scorer Wilfried Bony – for the trip to Hull and was rewarded with a 1-0 win.

It’s fair to assume the Ivory Coast international will be back on Boxing Day, though. His one shot on target in a 14 minute cameo as a sub was more than Frenchman Bafetimbi Gomis managed in the previous 76 minutes.

8. One of the first priorities on Eddie Howe’s list when he returned to Bournemouth two years ago was to persuade Marc Pugh to sign a new contract.

The talented winger had previously turned down new deals insisting he wanted to play in a higher division.

With just 18 months left on that agreement, it might be worth Howe talking to the 27-year-old again to tie him down a bit longer. Pugh has now hit six goals in the last nine games for the top of the Championship side.

9. Peter Taylor’s status as a former England boss isn’t keeping too many critics off his back as Gillingham battle at the lower end of League One.

The 61-year-old suffered abuse from Gills fans as his team clawed their way back from two down at home to Chesterfield only to lose to Jimmy Ryan’s volley.

It seemed tough on Taylor – his team had been unbeaten in six matches before Saturday.

10. Yeovil might need to spend pretty quickly some of the £250,000 plus bounty that a glamour FA Cup tie with Manchester United will bring them.

Four days after their efforts to win a replay with Accrington that secured the bonanza TV tie, Gary Johnson’s side lost 1-0 at home to relegation rivals Colchester.

And with a Boxing Day trip to League One leaders Bristol City followed by another six-pointer against Leyton Orient, they could find themselves bottom of the table by the time Wayne Rooney and co turn up at Huish Park on January 4th.
