A new survey by the Daily Mail has revealed millions of patients wait as long as three weeks to see their GP

Millions of patients wait as long as three weeks to see their GP, a Daily Mail survey reveals today.

Only one in three manages to secure a same-day appointment, despite Government promises to make such slots routinely available. One in five cannot get a consultation within seven days.

The survey suggests that two million adults wait between two and three weeks to see a doctor and half a million suffer a delay of three or four weeks. Leading GPs say the figures reflect their struggle to meet the demands of a growing population with ever larger numbers of pensioners.

And they are increasingly worried about late diagnosis of deadly illnesses such as cancer and lung disease.

Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘We do worry on patient safety grounds that access is becoming more of a problem.

‘Take someone who’s had a cough for four or five weeks. The chances are that it’s a long-running cough from a viral illness. But what if they’ve got TB, what if they’ve got lung cancer? If it does turn out to be cancer or TB then the quicker they’re dealt with the better.’

Clare Gerada, a Health Service primary care chief, said: ‘GPs who have been the bedrock of the NHS are struggling, seriously struggling. They are particularly struggling in London.

‘As we get older, as we live longer, we are putting more strain on general practice. It would not be unusual for GPs to see 40 to 50 patients in any one day.’

Dr Gerada is helping to draw up new guidelines for GPs in London – which may later be adopted across the country – to make it easier for patients to see their doctor.

They will urge surgeries to offer 
phone consultations as well as ensure GPs and nurses are freed up to 
offer more same-day appointments.

The
 Mail’s survey – in collaboration with over-50s group Saga – asked 
11,019 adults how long they waited the last time they saw a family 
doctor. Twenty-two per cent had to wait longer than a week and 4 per 
cent had to wait two to three weeks.

Another 1 per cent waited longer than three weeks and a handful waited longer than a month. Nationally, 4 per cent equates to two million people and 1 per cent to 500,000.

Many practices now offer same-day 
appointments only to those prepared to queue outside from the moment a 
surgery opens. In autumn the Care Quality Commission watchdog reported 
that some patients have resorted to taking stools to make their wait 
more bearable.

Surgeries 
have also become busier because fewer GPs work at evenings and weekends.
 A contract, which was negotiated under Labour in 2004, allowed them to 
opt out, meaning services are now largely run by private firms employing
 locums.

Many patients would rather 
wait and try for an appointment with their own doctor on the Monday 
morning – which is when surgeries are busiest. The Mail survey – carried
 out over a period of ten days on the internet this month – also found 
it is much harder to book an appointment now than it was just five years
 ago.

Forty-nine per cent said it was difficult or very difficult, compared with 21 per cent in November 2008.

One in three people manages to see their family doctor on the same day as calling for an appointment despite Government promises from Jeremy Hunt's Department of Health, that these slots would be made routinely available. One in five patients cannot get a consultation within seven days

The situation is worst in London, where 27 per cent wait more than a week and 1 per cent wait a month.

Joyce Robins of Patient Concern said: ‘Having to wait ten days to a fortnight is quite common and quite often you will hear of people waiting three weeks.

‘You have to wait longer if you want to see your own doctor – it’s easier if you’ll see any locum who’s popped into the surgery for a couple of weeks and will never be seen again.

‘For most people locums aren’t satisfactory. If you’ve got an ongoing problem you don’t want to discuss it with someone you’ll never see again.’

The lack of GP appointments has partly been blamed for the crisis in A&E units. NHS figures show that half of patients arriving in casualty need no treatment.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has urged GPs to provide more same-day appointments as one measure to ease the pressure in A&E.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘Unless urgent action is taken, we are going to see increasing pressure being placed upon an already overstretched A&E system, as patients visit the emergency departments in desperation.’
