Former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat on successor Manuel Pellegrini by claiming the Chilean should be winning a trophy every year.

Mancini thinks Pellegrini was 'really lucky' to inherit a strong side from him and he should be delivering continual success at the Etihad Stadium.

But Pellegrini, who did win two trophies last season, is now under heavy pressure with City faltering in their Barclays Premier League title defence and facing an uphill task against Barcelona in the Champions League.

Mancini, who was sacked by City in 2013 despite winning the Premier League title the previous year, told CNN: 'I think Pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players.

'I think City can win a title every year and have a chance - it should and must try to win a title every year.'

Mancini's jibe came on the eve of the second leg of City's last-16 Champions League tie at Barcelona, which they will go into trailing 2-1.

The success or otherwise of City's season now appears to hinge on the outcome at the Nou Camp as, trailing Chelsea by six points having played a game more, the Premier League looks beyond them.

But Mancini said: 'It's my opinion that City is the best team in the Premier League. It's in second and six points behind Chelsea but I think it's the best team.

'In the Premier League anything can happen right up to the last game, in the last minute. I think they should think that they have a chance to win the title.'
