It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside.

Take a good look at a couple of stars at the World Cup, the best band from Leicester since Showaddywaddy and a tricky Red Devil. 

And peek through your hands at Poults in the pond.

WHAT'S HOT 

BIG HITTERS

While England's best cricketers have been riding open-top buses, the rest of the world has reinvented the game. Again. Watching batsmen like Brendon McCullum and AB de Villiers during this World Cup has been invigorating and depressing at the same time.

AB de Villiers has been having a fair old hit during South Africa's World Cup campaign

And Brendon McCullum hasn't exactly been holding back for New Zealand

DUGOUT HONESTY

John Carver may not last long at Newcastle so let's enjoy him. Fan on Wednesday: 'Obertan is rubbish. Why don't you b****ck him?'. Carver: 'I have bloody b****cked him!!!'. Obertan – standing 10 yards away – chose not to contribute.

Obertan didn't cover himself in glory against his former club and invited a b****cking from his boss

THE ANFIELD PLAY LIST

Thanks to 40 years of dedication from match announcer George Sephton, Liverpool have long since played the best pre-match music and now he chooses tunes with hidden messages. Rather more obvious, though, is his current fondness for the Kasabian hit: 'Stevie'.

Is there another Stevie at Anfield apart from captain and Kop idol Gerrard?

THE UNEXPECTED

What is sport if not a platform for genius? Even if you don't care for Rugby League, I urge you to check out this piece of magic from Salford's Rangi Chase against Hull FC last weekend.

WHAT'S NOT

IAN POULTER

European golf fans will cherish Padraig Harrington's uplifting win at the Honda Classic but a final-round score of level par shouldn't have been enough. Sadly, Poulter's remarkable collapse – he found water five times in 10 holes – let Harrington past and his search for only his second US stroke-play victory continues.

DAVID SAKER

England's bowling coach has a fine reputation but what has he been doing these last few years? Last winter's Ashes tour saw three of his charges virtually unselectable while it is pertinent to ask which – if any – of our bowlers have actually improved in recent times.

DAVID BENTLEY

Bentley quit football at the age of 29 after falling out of love with the game. Now he is trying his hand at Gaelic Football, an experiment you can watch on reality TV. Bentley had a real talent for football sadly not matched by his ability to make the right choices.

WEST HAM FANS

They've been trying for months and it looks like they may finally get their man. So, for them, a warning. Clubs only tend to head one way after Sam Allardyce leaves. It's to be hoped the Olympic Stadium doesn't become the best ground in the Championship.

Will Sam Allardyce be prowling the technical area at the Olympic Stadium?
