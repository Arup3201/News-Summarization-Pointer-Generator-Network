A singer who hasn't cut her fingernails in two decades has shown off her incredible talons at the Guinness World Records 2014 launch in London.

Chris Walton, 47, holds the title for the world's longest fingernails after she stopped clipping them in 1993. They now reach more than 20 feet, twisting and turning in a way that would appear to make even the most simple tasks near impossible.

The grandmother is better known by her stage name 'The Dutchess' in Nevada and California. But her voice is far from the first thing you would notice if you bumped into her in the street.

Long talons: Chris Walton, holder of the Guinness world record for 'longest fingernails' attended the Guinness World Records 2014 Launch Party, at One Marylebone, in central London on Tuesday

Walton's bizarre nails curl in all 
directions - yet the mother of five cooks and cleans, and can even play 
the piano and use a computer.

Her
amazing dedication to her nails was officially recognized by the 2012 
edition of the Guinness Records Book. She painted them a dazzling gold 
to celebrate, a color they have remained.

'It's just like growing a long beard, or long hair,' Ms Walton said in 2011.

'I didn't grow my nails deliberately - I just stopped getting manicures and started taking care of my nails myself.

'Instead of clipping them back, I'd fill them in as they grew. I kept living and they kept growing.

What big nails you have: The 45-year-old woman stopped cutting her nails 19 years ago and they have grown to a combined length of 20 feet

'I think they got this long because I don't pay attention to them. I sometimes even forget they're there.'

Ms Walton strengthened her nails using acrylic on the outside and inside of the nails. This also helps to balance the weight on each hand.

The woman claims to have only lost a nail once, when fixing her car engine on the freeway, and otherwise has no trouble leading a normal life.

'Other people think I'm very fragile when they first meet me, but they soon see that I can do everything,' she said.

'In my next life, I'm going to grow my nails and pretend I can't do anything for myself so that people will do it all for me.

'My daughters don't cater to my needs, I do everything.

Music maker: As a singer popular in Nevada and California, Walton known as The Dutchess, can also play the piano snag-free

'I would never be stupid enough to stop my life so that I could grow my fingernails.

'I'd rather have the attention for my music.'

Ms Walton is well-known for her voice in California and Nevada - she has been singing and playing her music since the age of 14.

She
has just released a single called Live And Let Live - which she 
believes sums up her attitude to life and how being different does not 
have to push people apart.

'I believe we were all put on this earth to be different,' Ms Walton said.

'If people are mean to me, I think that although I can cut my nails off, there are people born different that can't get away from their difference.

'Would they tease them too and how would that person cope? We should just live and let live, and be positive.'
