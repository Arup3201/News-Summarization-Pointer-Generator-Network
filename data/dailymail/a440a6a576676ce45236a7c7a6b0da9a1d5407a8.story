There are those who believe Darren Bent is past his Barclays Premier League sell-by date but it is not an opinion shared by the striker himself.

‘When I was playing regularly in the Premier League I was scoring a lot of goals,’ said Derby’s on-loan forward. ‘Am I still good enough? 100 per cent, definitely.’

Bent, once of England, marked his first start for the Championship club with his first goal. At the age of 30, and with parent club Aston Villa unlikely to want him back, Bent’s top-flight opportunities may rest with a permanent move to the iPro and promotion.

‘There was a time when I was playing regularly that I’d have spells of five or six goals in the same number of games,’ he said. ‘It’s a case of believing in myself. It’s pointless being judged on five minutes here and there.’

Bent’s close-range header in the first half and a late Will Hughes goal saw off League One neighbours Chesterfield. 

It is back to the promotion campaign tomorrow against Blackburn and Bent hopes he will have another chance to play alongside Chris Martin in a new 3-5-2 formation.

‘If I can help Chrissy and Derby get promotion, that is the aim for everyone concerned,’ added Bent.

‘I’ve scored more than 100 Premier League goals and it’s something I’m very proud of.

‘No-one can take that away from me and hopefully I can add a few more — with Derby next season.’
