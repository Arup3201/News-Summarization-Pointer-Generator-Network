Tributes were paid by friends and family today to a late teenager who ‘touched thousands of lives’.

More than 600 people gathered to pay their respects to ‘strong’ and ‘brave’ charity fundraiser Jak Trueman, 15, days after he lost his fight with a rare form of cancer.

Among the mourners was his girlfriend Hannah Boyd, 14, and memories were shared during a touching ceremony at the Kirk of Calder Church in his home village of Mid Calder, West Lothian.

Mourning: Jak's Glasgow Rangers-themed coffin was carried into the church as his friends and classmates from West Calder High School and team mates of his football club Mid Calder Colts watched 

Many of the attendees were dressed in Glasgow Rangers football colours on the request of Jak's family, while more than 300 people stood outside listening to the service on speakers.

Mark Traynor, 44, an instrumental music instructor who taught Jak the tuba since he was nine years old, led the service.

He said: ‘I'm really proud to have taught the young lad. It's a sad day and he will be missed. He was a big likeable soul who always had a smile on his face.

‘The family want to make sure the legacy he left continues. Jak was very keen that what comes out of this tragedy, others are helped along the way.

‘I really think that he will be well known in this community for many years to come. My lasting memories of Jak are that we shared some good banter. It was a real pleasure to have known him.’

Happy memories: More than 200 pupils and teachers at West Calder High School watched Jak fulfil a vow to take his girlfriend Hannah to the prom last week (left). The couple are also pictured together (right).

The entrance hymn 'Our God is a Great Big God' preceded a prayer from Rev Nanda Groenewald. Current Hearts and former Rangers goalkeeper Neil Alexander also paid tribute to Jak with a poem.

He said: ‘I truly feel blessed that I got to meet Jak and be able to call him my pal. I am extremely privileged to be asked to be the patron of his charity.

‘I'm sure he is looking down with that smile we all knew and loved at the support here today. It just shows how many people loved and cared for such a special person.’

Mourners at the touching service heard readings by the teenager's GP, Ian MacLeod, and a version of the song 'A Drop in the Ocean' by Jak's sister Aimie.

Through tears, his mother Allison described him as an inspirational character who ‘touched thousands of lives on so many levels’. She said: ‘This is every mother's absolute nightmare come true and the very last place I thought I'd ever be standing.

‘But we are here and there is absolutely nothing we can do about it except honour my amazing, strong, brave, handsome, intelligent, loving, talented inspirational boy - my son Jak.

‘Proud is an understatement of how I feel about my precious son. Since he was born I have loved him unconditionally.

‘Jak's family and friends meant the world to him and he was never happier than when he was spending time with us and his beautiful Hannah.

‘I remember about six months when they had started going out, he came into the kitchen one day and said “mum, I just love that girl”.

‘If there is any purpose to this tragedy, it's got to be that my amazing son has touched thousands of lives on so many levels.

‘Our family members will never be the same again, in a good way, as he has brought us so much closer together than we already were. He has inspired us to see the good in every situation.’ 

In blue: Six months after the couple had started going out, Jak told his mother of Hannah 'I just love that girl'

End of the service: Family members, friends and colleagues embraced and applauded after the ceremony

She added: ‘Most of all, he has left a little bit of heaven here on earth.

In hospital: Jak, of West Lothian, died last Monday

‘Strangely enough, as much as my heart is broken and my body aches for him, I am actually finding myself beaming with pride at the amazing, wonderful, loving inspirational son I had. Even though his life has been short, it has been fantastic.’

As the service closed, Jak's coffin was carried out the church to the tune of 'Simply the Best' by Tina Turner. Family members, friends and colleagues embraced and applauded.

Jak was diagnosed with a very rare form of blood cancer - known as Gammadelta T-cell lymphoma - in August.

He had been set for a bone marrow transplant three weeks ago, but learned that the disease had spread to his bones and organs.

He spent his last days fulfilling as many of his wishes as he could and trying to raise as much money as possible for charity.

More than 200 pupils and teachers at West Calder High School watched him fulfil a vow to take his girlfriend Hannah to the prom a fortnight ago. Hedied last Monday.

Collections at the funeral service were given to a charity set up by Jak's family, dubbed Team Jak, in a bid to fight cancer.

A fundraising page for leukaemia and lymphoma research set up during his final days has since raised more than £55,000 - well over double the original target.Jak was laid to rest at St Drostan's Cemetery in Markinch.
