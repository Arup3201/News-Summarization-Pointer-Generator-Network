Paul Casey is returning to Augusta after securing his place at next week's Masters.

The 37-year-old has not played in the season's first major for the last two years but will tee it up on April 9 due to his position in the world's top 50.

The Englishman, whose world ranking got as high as three in 2009, came into the new season outside the top 50 but a second-placed finish at the Northern Trust Open followed by a tie for third at the Honda Classic saw him move back in and his place at Augusta has now been assured.

The 37-year-old said he is relieved that he held on to the last qualifying spot for the Masters when the matter was decided by results elsewhere and said: ‘On the outside looking in is hardly where you want to be for the season’s first major.’

Casey's best Masters finish was a tie for sixth on his debut in 2004.

Indian Anirban Lahiri, who has two European Tour wins this season, will be making his debut at Augusta alongside Austrian Bernd Wiesberger.

South Africa's Branden Grace, too, has earned an invitation for the third consecutive season.

There’s still no word on whether Tiger Woods will play, although he did turn up at Augusta for a practice round on Tuesday.
