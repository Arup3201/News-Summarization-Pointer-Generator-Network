Fun day: Haitham al-Haddad had hired the theme park exclusively for a day of 'halal activities'.

Legoland has been forced to close this weekend after far-right extremists threatened to target a planned Muslim fun day booked by a radical cleric even though it had been cancelled.

The theme park in Windsor, Berkshire, had been hired out exclusively to the Muslim Research and Development Foundation.

The group, based in east London, is run by Haitham al-Haddad, who is said to be one of the top 25 radical preachers in Britain.

More than 1,000 Muslim families were expected to attend on Sunday at a cost of around £100,000 before police advised that the event be cancelled.

However, despite this bosses at Legoland have decided to close the theme park this weekend including its 150-room hotel because of safety fears.

A spokesman for Legoland said: 'Unfortunately the Legoland Windsor Resort has had to close the Hotel on Saturday 8th and Sunday 9th March 2014 after threats from right-wing groups made against the Resort.

'The Hotel closure follows the cancellation of a private event that was due to take place on Sunday 9th March prior to the Theme  Park re-opening for the 2014 season on Friday 14th Match.

'We are extremely sorry that we’ve had to cancel guest bookings and whole heartedly understand the disappointment of those families that will be unable to attend, particularly as we haven’t been able to give them more notification because of the dynamic nature of this situation.

'The safety and security of our guests and our members of staff has to be our is our number one priority, which is why we’ve made the difficult decision to close the Hotel.  All guests that were booked in to stay will be given a full refund.'

The theme park has been inundated with threatening phone calls, emails and posts online after details of Sunday's event emerged.

One Neo-Nazi group wrote that it would make police in Thames Valley their 'b****' and that threatening children 'rocks'.

The post on the group's Facebook page also said: ‘My dad would be so proud if he knew I existed #itsgreatbeingus’

Members of the English Defence League were also said to have been involved.

Target: Staff at Legoland were threatened by far-right group after it emerged that the park had been booked out.

Day trip: More than 1,000 Muslim families were to attend the day costing around £100,000.

A spokeswoman for Legoland told MailOnline the neo-Nazi group also posted a picture of one of their Muslim workers on Facebook with an offensive comment.

She added the extent of the abuse led Legoland to take down its Facebook page for a week.

The decision to cancel the event completely was made on the advice of police after no guarantees for the safety of staff and guests could be made.

Thames Valley Police are investigating reports of the offences under the Malicious Communications Act.

Legoland has previously hosted several exclusive parties and celebrities such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as well as David and Victoria Beckham.
