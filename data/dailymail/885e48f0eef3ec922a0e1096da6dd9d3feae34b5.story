Daniel Fing has been named as the man at the centre of an investigation after explosives were discovered in a Queensland home

Police have found maps in a Queensland house pointing to possible bombing targets as well as more than 50 kilograms of chemicals used to make explosives.

One of the sheets found at the property included a road map with an arrow pointing to the corner of George and Rawson Street in the Sydney CBD,  an intersection which lies just a few hundred metres from Sydney's Central Station.

The word uniform was also apparently scrawled on the same piece of paper, a possible reference to the Uniform And Kitchenette shop nearby.

On a second map was written 'brothel', 'grave', and 'bridge'  - which could be read as clues to a location on Sandgate Road in Newcastle, two hours north of Sydney.

The maps and liquid explosives were discovered on Monday at a property Daniel Fing was renting in Pullenvale,15 kilometres west of Brisbane, which has since been abandoned, according to Nine News.

When contacted a Queensland Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'It's an ongoing investigation and it would not be appropriate to comment at this time.'

Fing, 30, is in police custody, and is now at the centre of a joint investigation.

On Monday police discovered maps pointing to possible bombing targets at a property in Pullenvale, Queensland

Officers found the documents during a search on the house where they previously uncovered more than 50 kilograms of explosives

Last week officers were detonating bomb-making material at the Pullenvale property after an array of chemicals - some highly unstable - were found.

Red Cedar Road was closed off for nearly 48 hours while officers carried out detonations.

The quantity and type of materials found were alarming to officers, and they are currently assessing whether there was a plot to carry out any attacks in place.

The whole street where the property lies was closed off while officers detonated explosives last week

The alleged mastermind behind this possible attack on Sydney's bustling CBD bombed the car of his ex-girlfriend's lover in 2006, while it was parked at a Newcastle McDonalds.

The car and the one beside it was completely destroyed, but the owner escaped unharmed, the Newcastle Herald reported.

Fing pleaded guilty and was charged just one day before he was due to be released on parole for unrelated explosives charges.

In 2011, Fing was the victim of an alleged drive-by shooting. His father ,Trevor Fing, is a convicted serial fraud.

Fing has a previous conviction relating to explosives and blew up the car of an ex-girlfriend's lover in 2006
