In an email exchange, Lake Mary, FL Police Chief Steve Bracknell agreed that George Zimmerman is a ‘ticking time bomb.’

Mr Bracknell, head of police where Mr Zimmerman lives, was responding to an angry email from a resident complaining cops aren’t protecting citizens from the increasingly erratic, gun-toting, Stand Your Ground expert. The police chief agreed with the angry citizen’s assessment of Mr Zimmerman.

Mr Zimmerman rose into the national consciousness after admitting to killing unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin while on a neighborhood watch patrol. He was found innocent of murder in a dramatic verdict watched live on television by millions.

A 'ticking time bomb': Locals, as well as police, are clearly concerned with the perceived danger posed to them by George Zimmerman (right)

Reacting to the latest incident involving Lake Mary’s most famous resident and his trademark firearm, local resident Santiago Rodriguez emailed Mr Bracknell through a generic contact form on the Lake Mary Police Department’s website.

Mr Santiago railed against the department for what he felt was a lack of purpose in the department’s response to Mr Zimmerman allegedly threatening his estranged wife with a gun, smashing her iPad and punching his father-in-law in the face, according to reports.

Among the many complaints made to Mr Bucknell about the department, the concerned resident said ‘’Zimmerman is a Sandy Hook, Aurora waiting to happen. Your job is to protect the communities you serve and you are failing big time,’ read the email chain first made public by Think Progress.

The embattled police chief responded to the email, surprising Mr Rodriguez.

‘Your reference to Sandy Hook............................. I agree.’

In his second email, Mr Santiago thanked Mr Bracknell for replying, then countered that ‘George is a ticking time bomb… sooner or later another mother and father is going to be on CNN lshing out against the system due to this man snapping.’

The chief again agreed.

‘As for your final thoughts, again, on a personal note, I agree.’

These comments come hot on the heels of Chief Bracknell venting his frustration with Mr Zimmerman to a Los Angeles Times reporter Sept 9.

‘Man, it would be fantastic if you have an apartment out there [in California] for George Zimmerman,’ Bracknell joked to the reporter. ‘This guy is killing me.’

Neither Chief Bracknell, nor a public information officer for the Lake Mary Police Department responded to attempts by MailOnline to reach them.

Mr Bracknell did backpedal a bit to ThinkProgress when asked for further comment on his recent remarks.

Explaining that he did not agree with Mr Rodriguez, the chief told the site he was ‘referring to the fact that [Zimmerman] seems to be involved in incidents’ involving firearms.’

The Sandy Hook reference is a nod to the December shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown CT., that left 20 innocent children and six adult dead.
