Even now, mere mention of the place evokes fear, horror, shame and anger.

The workhouse was the institution you ended up in when things really couldn't get any worse. To enter one of the foreboding Victorian buildings - where even the architecture, it seems, was designed to intimidate - was the ultimate dread.

Inmates (and what else to call them?) may have been fed and clothed, but the conditions were often barbaric and the fate of those who entered ultimately tragic.

And a shocking number of our ancestors were among them. In the opening minutes of a new documentary, Secrets From The Workhouse, we learn that one in ten Britons has a family connection to these places.

More than 500 were built in the 50 years following the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act, which made it compulsory for those seeking government relief from poverty to enter the workhouse.

But the governments of the day didn't want to promote them as havens of shelter. Instead, they made them as terrifying as possible.

Those entering had to relinquish all personal items - even clothes - and undertake backbreaking work such as breaking stones for ten hours a day, six days a week. Men were separated from their wives; children from their parents.

Quite how many of us have the workhouse etched somewhere on the family tree is brought home by the range of celebrities taking part in this harrowing programme, tracing their own ancestors' steps into these hellholes.

Actress Felicity Kendal clearly had no idea what skeletons lay in her family closet, and when she delves into the past of her great-grandmother, Mary Liddell, she discovers a woman who ended up, shamed and ostracised by society, in the workhouse - not once but twice.

Mary had married her husband John Liddell in 1880 and bore him nine children. Her tenth child, however, was the result of an illicit affair and - as was common at the time - Mary was cast out of the family home and ended up in a Cumbrian workhouse, where her son Albert, Felicity's great-uncle, was born.

She was, it emerges, branded a woman of ill-repute and low morals. Pregnant adulterers like Mary were forced to wear special uniforms with yellow and black stripes, designed to shame.

With mounting horror, Felicity discovers her great-grandmother bore not one but two illegitimate children - pretty much sealing her fate as a fallen woman.

At one point, poring over the archives, she shakes her head in disbelief. 'This woman is extraordinary,' she says.

She manages a smile - delivered along with an expletive - before concluding, 'She's a goer, isn't she?'

Later, discovering that one child dies and another is taken into care, she makes a poignant pilgrimage to an unmarked grave. 'It's heartbreaking.'

Novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford is similarly upset, her features becoming more and more pinched as she discovers exactly what her mother Freda would have gone through as a six-year-old child, brought to a workhouse by her own mother.

Freda never told Barbara she'd been there. It was a secret too terrible to tell even her own family.

The multi-millionaire novelist only made the discovery when her biographer went searching for historical records.

'When I found out I burst into tears,' she admits. 'My mother had been such a sweet person. I couldn't imagine her in a workhouse. It begged the question, “Why?”'

By the end - discovering why her mother never mentioned any of this awful past - she is weeping openly.

Then there's actor Brian Cox, whose great-grandfather ended up in the Scottish equivalent of the workhouse, the poorhouse.

At one point Brian looks as if he might punch the poor archivist charged with breaking the news of how brutally his family was treated by the authorities. 'B******s!' he declares, as the full horror of his family history is laid bare.

His great-grandfather Patrick McCann was an Irish immigrant who set up home in Glasgow with his wife in the late 1800s. They had eight children; five didn't survive their early years.

Cox stands in front of the tenement where the family would have lived alongside 40 or 50 other people. So cramped were the conditions that each family had to share one bed. 'It just leaves you... it's really bad,' he says, his voice faltering.

Brian's journey to discover what became of Patrick McCann makes for difficult viewing. 'Unbearable!' he says as the pieces are put together.

Patrick first seeks sanctuary in a poorhouse in 1899 when his son Samuel falls ill with bronchitis, but the stay is only a short one. Records show he's back in 1901, desperately ill himself. He's discharged again, but is back almost every year thereafter.

For 14 years he boomerangs in and out of the poorhouse, at one point - despite medical records showing he's a very ill man - being branded a 'malingerer', until in 1911 he's declared insane.

'There's this endless spiral into the abyss, until finally he goes nuts,' says Brian, incredulous. 'It was a harsh system, horrible. It's an absolute outrage what they did to these people.'

Presenter Fern Britton discovers her great-great-great-grandfather, a man who went by the wonderful name of Friend Carter, managed to avoid the workhouse until he was 91 years of age. His son Jesse wasn't so lucky, however.

In 1879 Jesse, then 23, fell ill and ended up in a workhouse in Kent. Jesse didn't survive, but what happened to his body reduces Fern to tears. If a family couldn't afford to pay for a burial, the authorities had the right to hold onto it for medical research. It would have caused the family great anguish, Fern learns, because of beliefs about the afterlife at the time.

She is visibly distraught. 'I always thought of the Victorians as great philanthropists, God-fearing and kind. Yet if you were living in poverty at that time, you were penalised for it.'

Friend Carter also died in the dreaded workhouse, but somehow the family managed to scrape together the money to take his body back home for burial - a happy ending, of sorts, for Fern, who greets the news with tears pouring down her cheeks.

The grim days of the workhouse may now be consigned to history, but this show underlines how recent that history is - and how close in other ways too.

'One of my greatest fears has always been poverty,' Brian Cox admits. 'Now maybe I know why. You begin to realise it's in the DNA.'

Secrets From The Workhouse will be on ITV on Tuesday 25 June at 9pm.
