Leighton Baines may have been an Everton defender for eight years, but it seems he still isn't quite sure who is in charge of what at the club.

Baines, who is currently out of the side because of an injury, was a pundit for ITV's coverage of his team's 2-1 win over Dinamo Kiev.

But when asked about how his team defend from corners, following Oleg Gusev's first half header, Baines seemed completely stumped over who makes the decisions - even though he has played 63 times under manager Roberto Martinez.

'I'm not too sure,' said Baines, when asked whether it was Tim Howard's decision not to have a man on the near post at corners, or if the orders came from Martinez.

'We get the organisation before the game from the manager and the assistant manager before the game, so I'm not too sure who makes the final call.'

What Baines was confident about was that the defending wasn't good enough. 'There's shades of the goal we conceded against Arsenal as well,' he added.

Everton bounced back from the early set-back, as goals from Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku saw them take a lead from the first leg.
