First-time buyers in London are typically forced to take out a mortgage of nearly £200,000 to get on to the property ladder, figures showed yesterday.

The super-size loan highlights how the capital’s housing market means only the rich, the very well-paid or those with generous parents can afford to buy.

In many parts of the capital, such as Kensington, Chelsea, Westminster and Camden, the average asking price is more than £1million.

First-time buyers in London are typically required to take out a mortgage of nearly £200,000 and pay a deposit of more than £64,000, figures have shown (file picture)

The figures, from the Council of 
Mortgage Lenders, showed that the average first-time buyer in London 
takes out a mortgage of £192,640 with an average household income of 
£52,130.

In London a 
typical first-time buyer puts down a 25 per cent deposit because 
otherwise mortgage rates are prohibitively expensive.

That means the average price paid is £256,853 and the typical first-time buyer needs a £64,213 deposit.

The
household income of £52,130 is double the amount the average worker 
with a full-time job earns – the national average full-time salary is 
£26,500.

The council’s 
figure is based on the income of the person, or people, applying for a 
loan, which means they could relate either to a single person’s salary 
or a couple’s salary.

By 
comparison, the average first-time buyer in England takes out a mortgage
of around £120,000 and has a household income of £36,520.

Despite the size of the loan they must take out, the number of first-time buyers in London getting a mortgage has jumped to its highest level since the credit crunch began in 2007

The
figures emerged as the new Bank of England governor yesterday made 
clear he fears a housing market bubble could develop.

Mark Carney said: 
‘The Bank of England is acutely aware of the risk of unsustainable 
credit and house price growth.’

Many Londoners are being forced to move further and further out before they can afford to buy.

Despite
the size of the loan they must take out, the number of first-time 
buyers in London getting a mortgage has jumped to its highest level 
since the credit crunch began in 2007, the CML said.

Between April and 
June, 11,200 first-time buyers took out a mortgage, a 38 per cent 
increase on the same period last year.

Brian
Murphy, head of lending at the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said: ‘Access to
the property market is clearly improving, despite warnings of an 
impending housing bubble.’

David
Newnes, director of LSL Property Services, owners of the Your Move and 
Reeds Rains estate agencies, warned that too few homes are coming onto 
the market at a time when demand is high.

Government
initiatives, such as two schemes, both called Help to Buy, are aimed at
helping first-time buyers, but they are stoking fears of another 
bubble.
