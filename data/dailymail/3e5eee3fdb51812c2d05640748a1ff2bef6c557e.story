Carl Froch topped off his epic victory against George Groves by asking model girlfriend Rachael Cordingley to marry him.

Froch asked the question after Cordingley rushed over to him to congratulate him on the eight-round stoppage in his rematch with Groves.

He did not let the watching 80,000 crowd at Wembley, going crazy after witnessing Froch's unstoppable right hand which ended the fight, put him off.

Although Froch spends his life in a ring, unfortunately he could not get one arranged in time for the fight, so it was not an official proposal.

But Rachael, who he has two kids with, agreed to marry him.

Froch said: 'I did ask Rachael a sneaky question after the fight but it's not official. She said, “Yes.”

'I told her how much I love her. I didn't actually officially propose to her. I was going to but I couldn't sort a ring out.

'I will be marrying Rachael one day. This is the most special moment of my life -- the next will be wedding Rachael and making us a proper family, me, my kids and her.

'This night will be remembered for defending title.'
