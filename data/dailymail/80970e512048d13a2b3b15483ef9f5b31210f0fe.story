New York is deserted today on what should be one of its busiest weekends for tourism of the year, as businesses count the cost of a four-day city shutdown after Hurricane Irene forced people indoors.

Retailers will
make heavy losses because of a shutdown on one of the last weekends before children go back
to school - and one of the most popular times for tourists to visit.

But it might have been worse for New York City, as a direct
hit by the damage-wreaking hurricane could have cost it up to $35billion in
damage and increased the chance of a double-dip recession.

However C. Britt Beemer, of America's Research Group, told
MailOnline losses will be ‘catastrophic’ for businesses, as this weekend would
have seen 10 per cent of back-to-school shopping.

‘It's catastrophic because you basically lose all the volume you were going to do,’ he said. ‘Many people in the U.S. are getting ready for the
kids to go back to school.’

Around 85 per cent of revenue shops would have taken this
weekend will ‘evaporate’, and it is especially bad because back-to-school is the year’s second largest shopping event, he said.

One tenth of shopping ahead of school restarting would
have happened this weekend, as many parents would be taking their children on
holiday for Labor Day next weekend.

As well as lost sales, damage is an issue as flooding is a separate
policy on most home insurance - so consumers will be left with less
disposable income after they have spent money on repairs.

This weekend was going to see bumper sales for retailers - until Hurricane Irene came along.

Parents would have been shopping for children ahead of the return to school next month.

And New York City was expecting to be full of tourists visiting during the summer holidays.

But all that lost revenue will cost the city's economy billions of dollars, experts say.

'It’s going to be tough,' Jon Taylor, president of Babylon Village Chamber in Long Island, New York, told Patch. 'We just don’t need this after having to weather the economy.'

The total clean-up cost through 10 East Coast states is estimated at up to $13billion by Kinetic Analysis Corporation because of the widespread flooding in low-lying areas, reported ABC News.

University of Maryland professor Peter Morici said up to $45billion of damage has been caused on the East Coast, factoring in physical damage and the loss of two days of economic activity.

Around four million people have been left without power and more than 10,000 flights have been cancelled, while train services across the East Coast region remain indefinitely suspended.

But in New York, a hurricane hitting at 
around 100mph would have flooded the subway and acres of pricey real 
estate in the five boroughs - as well as costing the city half of its 
annual budget.

The city would have required state and 
federal assistance and recession fears would have been heightened from a
 damage response cost of around one per cent of the total U.S. output.

Governor Chris Christie said he expects damages from Hurricane Irene to run into billions of dollars along New Jersey's Atlantic coast and from inland river flooding.

'I've got to imagine that the damage estimates are going to be in the billions of dollars, if not in the tens of billions of dollars,' he told NBC.

He said state damage assessments along the coast would begin on Sunday afternoon but that inland damage may not become obvious until river flooding subsides as late as Tuesday.

One possible scenario was that the hurricane came ashore 50 miles east of Manhattan on Long Island, which would have caused around $10billion in damage, reported the New York Times.

If an even stronger storm with speeds of at least 111mph was to have directly hit Manhattan it could have caused $100billion damage, according to estimates.

A Category 3 storm could have rivalled the $235billion economic damage that the Japanese earthquake and tsunami was estimated to have caused earlier this year.

A Category 4 hurricane seems physically impossible but if it was to happen in theory it could cause trillions of dollars of damage, reported the New York Times.

Any hurricane hitting New York is 
such a big issue as the city’s annual gross domestic product is 
estimated at $1.4trillion, which is around 10 per cent of the whole U.S.
 output.

This means a long-term non-functioning economy could cause a national and even global meltdown, and could make it one of the most expensive natural disasters the world has ever suffered.

‘We're looking at a multibillion-dollar event - that's almost certain. We're not looking at a hurricane as strong as a Katrina or a Hurricane Ike. But we are looking at a storm that will move over an area that has much greater population than an area like New Orleans or South Texas'

Insurance expert Bob Hartwig

New York City’s real estate value is around $800billion, so analysts can only imagine what would happen if even a small percentage of this was to be destroyed by freak weather.

The major cities affected by Hurricane Irene are New York City; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Boston, Massacusetts; Baltimore, Maryland; and Washington D.C.

These account for a huge 16 per cent of U.S. national output and 14 per cent of employment, so a storm that disrupts work for several days could have a serious impact, reported The Fiscal Times.

Insurers are expecting to suffer huge losses due to the hurricane, airlines are reeling as thousands of flights have been cancelled and shops cannot open so they losing sales.

Clouds gathering: Manhattan is seen as Hurricane Irene approaches. A direct hit on New York City could have cost the economy up to $35billion in damage and significantly increase chances of a double-dip recession

The 1938 Category 3 hurricane that hit almost 40 miles from Central Park at speeds of 120mph caused the equivalent of around $45billion in today’s money, estimated meteorologist Roger Pielke.

'Any kind of severe weather tends to get insurance companies nervous. When they get nervous, their number crunchers take another look at what their exposure is and whether they’re charging enough and that may lead to rate increases'Consumer advocate Amy Bach

Other estimates from Kinetic Analysis suggest the hurricane could have threatened up to $14billion in insured losses and $20billion in overall economic loss, reported Bloomberg.

Big problems include lost hours at work, power outages and a shutdown in sea and air traffic.

‘Any kind of severe weather tends to get insurance companies nervous,’ consumer advocate Amy Bach told The Fiscal Times.

‘When they get nervous, their number crunchers take another look at what their exposure is and whether they’re charging enough and that may lead to rate increases.’

Hurricane Katrina cost an eye-watering 
$134billion in damage, as well as 1,800 fatalities, and although Irene 
is a much weaker storm it is wreaking havoc over a significantly larger 
area.

Despite the horrendous weather and shut subway, the New York Stock Exchange still expects to open as usual on Monday morning.

It has backup generators and can run on its own, but a spokesman said the exchange may change opening plans depending on the severity of the storm.

With many traders living outside of Manhattan, a suspended transport network means it's unclear how many traders will get in to work.

‘We're looking at a multibillion-dollar event - that's almost certain,’ insurance expert Bob Hartwig told NPR. ‘We're not looking at a hurricane as strong as a Katrina or a Hurricane Ike.

‘But we are looking at a storm that will move over an area that has much greater population than an area like New Orleans or South Texas.’

There was expected to be damage to buildings and transport infrastructure from storm surges and heavy rainfall, as well as damage to vehicles and beaches, reported the Huffington Post.

Petrol supplies fell as drivers filled up before leaving or just topped off their tanks as a precaution before the storm hit, with some pump prices rising around $0.03 per gallon overnight.

‘This is a worst-case scenario. This was supposed 
to be a prime weekend for apparel retailers’

C.
 Britt Beemer, America's Research Group

The hurricane comes in the thick of the critical back-to-school shopping season, a time between mid-July and September that is typically the second biggest shopping period of the year. 

For some big retailers, Manhattan is particularly important because it can account for as much as 10 percent of their annual revenue. 

A washout could have a huge impact on retailers' top and bottom lines, as estimates were made that  Irene will stop around 80 million shoppers from hitting the malls this weekend across the U.S.

‘This is a worst-case scenario,’ Mr Beemer added. ‘This was supposed to be a prime weekend for apparel retailers.’
