Flying enthusiasts are being offered the chance to buy the trip of a lifetime – alongside one of the only two airworthy Lancaster Bombers in the world today.

Costing £2,150 per seat, a 10-seater Piper Chieftain will be powering in the sky with the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum’s legendary aircraft.

The Lancaster will be in the UK, flying from Canada to England, for four days, arriving on August 8, making the 18-hour trip for the first and final time.

Final flight: The Lancaster will be making the journey from Canada to London for the last time

It is the only time the plane, which will be teaming up with the Battle of Britain Memorial Lancaster while in the UK, has been in a suitable condition to make the flight since the Sixties.

It will be the first time the world's last two airworthy Lancaster bombers have flown together.

Kent-based company Action Stations is selling the flights on board four Piper Chieftains over five days, on which there are 130 seats available.

The price includes a 40-minute flight, flying alongside the 69ft-long Lancaster – with a wingspan of 102ft - for about 30 minutes, as well as a tour of the plane and a photo opportunity.

During the flight, the Avro Lancaster Mk X - dedicated to Andrew Mynarski, the last Canadian airman to be awarded the VC in World War II – will move from side of the observation aircraft to the other.

Stephen Burt, CEO of Action Stations, said: ‘To see such a large, historic aircraft flying so close you can wave to the pilot will be a deeply moving experience.

‘Over 55,000 aircrew lost their lives flying similar machines during the Second World War, and the poignancy of the occasion will not be lost.’

The Piper Chieftains will leave from Humberside, where the Lancaster will be based, down to Lincoln Cathedral.

The building in the Lincolnshire countryside would have been one of the last views bomber crews had of England before embarking on their mission.

The planes will then fly out towards the North Sea, and over The Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Museum, home of the Avo Lancaster Just Jane – giving those on board the chance to photograph the two bombers together.

After that, they will head to the beaches of Grimsby to see the Lancaster ‘flying in a maritime setting’, before returning to Humberside, where the Merlin will land, taxiing over to the viewing area.

The 130 seats, which come with the restrictions that buyers must weigh no more than 14 stone, and must be able to walk unaided, will be spread over five days – August 18, 19, 20, 26 and 27.

Mr
 Burt added: ‘We offer these flights to ensure the memory of those 
aircrews who gave of themselves in our hour of need, is never forgotten.

‘We
 can appreciate and enjoy the aircraft that are kept in museums, but it 
is only when they are fired up and flying that these legendary machines 
capture the attention and imagination of all.

‘And
 if the story of the heroism of those people is to be passed on to 
future generations, it will be through the regular flying of these 
aircraft - their sight and sound will inspire future generations.’

The Avro Lancaster is one of the Second World War's most-recognisable British aircraft.

It
 is most famous for its involvement in the Dambuster raids, which saw 19
 Lancasters attack German dams with Sir Barnes Wallis's 'bouncing bombs'
 in 1943.

The
 plane was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum - which 
features the aircraft used by Canada from World War II until today - in 
1978, when it underwent a 10-year restoration, and has remained 
airworthy since 1988.

Action
 Stations, which has raised funds for good causes including the Kent Air
 Ambulance, the RAF Benevolent Fund, and the Battle of Britain Memorial 
Trust, also offers flights in other classic aircraft, including 
Spitfires and Hurricanes.

Mr
 Burt added: ‘This will be the last opportunity in our lifetime to see 
this iconic aircraft fly in the UK, and we are immensely proud to 
present fellow enthusiasts with this unique opportunity to mark this 
momentous occasion with our flights.’

Once in a lifetime: It will mark the final time a Lancaster flies from Canada to England

Honoured: Andrew Mynarski was the last Canadian airman to be awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War

'Probably the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War, the Avro Lancaster had impressive flying characteristics and operational performance,' the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum says on its website.

The Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum's Lancaster Mk X, which was built at Victory Aircraft, Malton, Canada, in July 1945, will be flying to the UK in August.

The plane is dedicated to the memory of Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski who was awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Canadian Mynarski won the award on June 13, 1944, when his Lancaster was shot down in flames by a German night fighter during the Second World War.

As the bomber fell, Mynarski managed to free the tail gunner trapped in the rear turret of the blazing and out-of-control aircraft before he died.

The crew member survived and lived to
 tell the tale, resulting in the Victoria Cross being awarded in 1946 - 
the last such award to a Canadian airman in the Second World War.

The
 Lancaster bomber, which is flying to the UK in August, was dedicated to
 Mynarski, and is referred to as the 'Mynarski Memorial Lancaster'.

It is painted in the colours of his aircraft KB726 – VR-A, which flew with RCAF Squadron.

Unique opportunity: The passengers will fly alongside the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War

In
 1952, it suffered a serious accident and received a replacement wing 
centre section from a Lancaster that had flown in combat over Germany.

It served as a maritime patrol aircraft in Newfoundland for many years and was retired from the RCAF in late 1963.

With help from the Sulley Foundation in 1977, it was acquired from the Royal Canadian Legion in Goderich, Ontario, where it had been on outside display.

Eleven years passed before it was completely restored and flew again on September 24, 1988.
