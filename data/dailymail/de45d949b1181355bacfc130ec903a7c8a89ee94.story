Prince William is planning to start work as an air ambulance helicopter pilot in the summer after passing a 'rigorous' set of exams.

The Duke of Cambridge hopes to work 'as close to full time as possible' flying both day and night shifts after completing  mandatory ground school training, which is expected to take a few months.

He had been studying for his air transport pilot licence exams since last September and passed all 14 exams required to work as a civilian helicopter pilot, Kensington Palace revealed.

The written exams covered a range of topics including the principles of flight, navigation, flight Planning and air law. 

The announcement was made shortly after the Duke of Cambridge touched down in Tokyo for a seven-day tour of Japan and China.

Shortly after his current tour, he will undergo extra training with Bond Air Services before starting work for the East Anglian Air Ambulance service in the summer.

This training will involve in-flight skill testing, simulated training and instrument rating, which involves flying in poor weather conditions.

Prince William will aim to work as close to full time as possible, covering shifts for the team based in Cambridge and Norwich and his salary will be donated to charity.

As a result of his new job, the Duke's family are expected to spend more time at Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate.

The second-in-line to the throne has completed seven-and-a-half years of full-time military service.

He began  his career with the Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals) and later served with The Royal Air Force, with his final posting as an RAF Search and Rescue Pilot. 

The royal left operational service in the Armed Forces in September 2013.

A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: 'Shortly before departing for Japan and China, The Duke completed and passed his Air Transport Pilot's Licence exams, which he required before starting work as an Air Ambulance Pilot.  

'After he returns from his tour to Japan and China in March, he will start working for East Anglian Air Ambulance and be formally employed by Bond Air Services.

'He will initially be required to complete another period of mandatory training, involving aircraft training, in-flight skills testing and further written exams.'

He will spend the next week touring Japan and China, highlighting British links with both countries, and addressing issues such innovation, trade and creativity.

The pitching for Britain had already started in Tokyo before he arrived with UK designers showing of their latest inventions at the British embassy. 

Miguel Head, William's private secretary, said ahead of the visit that the Duke was personally interested in the two countries which he has not visited before.

He added: 'The Duke's hugely looking forward to the visit and getting to know two countries that will be important in his life for years to come.'
