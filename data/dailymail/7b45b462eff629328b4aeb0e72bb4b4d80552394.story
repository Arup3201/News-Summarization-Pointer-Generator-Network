A new era for mobile phone use begins today as superfast 4G products and services are made available to millions of consumers in 11 cities across the UK.

Claiming to offer speeds five times faster than current networks, it is billed as a 'landmark day' for Britain.

However, experts have hit out at the pricing, and warned consumers to wait.

Britain's first 4G network, run by EE, launches today -but has come under fire for its high prices

Costly: EE has come under fire for its high pricing, with experts advising consumers to wait for rival networks to launch

EE, formerly known as Everything 
Everywhere, launch its range of 4G products and services today in  London, 
Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Glasgow, 
Liverpool, Southampton and Manchester.

The launch comes amid criticism of EE’s 4G pricing plans, which will hit customers on certain tariffs with additional charges if they exceed download allowances.

Consumers will have to switch their mobile contract to EE to use the new network.

The cheapest EE tariff offers just 
500mb worth of downloads each month - the equivalent to two one-hour 
programmes on the BBC iPlayer.

Customers
who want to download more than their 500mb allowance will have to pay 
extra, with a user looking to download eight one-hour programmes a month
facing additional charges of up to £180 a year.

The
EE deals range from £36 a month for 500mb of data downloads to £56 a 
month for 8GB of data.

The 4G network, which offers speeds up 
to five times faster than 3G, will be available on the Apple iPhone 5 as
well as devices from HTC, Samsung, Nokia and Huawei.

There are no plans for unlimited data downloads, leading experts to warn consumers to wait.

'Very few consumers should buy a 4G contract from day one,' said Jason Jenkins of CNET.

'The service only works in eleven cities today (although many more will follow quickly), and it's very expensive to use.

'Come back in a year or two though, 
and many more of us will be on 4G, so if you're buying a top-end phone, 
make sure it will work with all the 4G networks that will launch in the 
UK.

'For example, Apple's iPhone 5 will 
only work with one or two UK 4G networks in the future, whereas the 
Samsung Galaxy S3 LTE or Nokia Lumia 920 will work with all of them.

However, Jenkins admits the service is a big step forward.

'If you don't do your research, you 
could get caught out once your contract comes to an end and you want to 
use the phone you paid so much for on a different network.'

'Today is massive for UK tech - 
Britain's first 4G phone network launches.

'This is an incredibly 
important milestone in our race to compete with the rest of the world as
several other countries already have 4G.

EE customers in a further five cities - Belfast, Derby, Hull, Newcastle and Nottingham - will have access to 4G by the end of the year.

    The group then plans to roll out the service to further towns, cities and rural areas next year, with population coverage of 70% and rising to 98% in 2014.

Rival operators including Vodafone, O2 owner Telefonica and Three will be able to launch their own 4G services and products from next spring.

The companies had threatened legal action against communications regulator Ofcom over its 4G auction process, which has allowed EE to be the sole UK provider of the superfast services until next year.

Vodafone launched a '4G phone promise' last week, offering customers the chance to bring an eligible phone into any store and have 70% knocked off their remaining contract, in exchange for taking on a 4G device.

Olaf Swantee, CEO at EE, said: 'Today is
a landmark day for our company, the UK mobile industry and, most 
importantly, the country’s businesses and consumers.

'But
this is just the start as our 4G network will continue to grow stronger
and wider by the day.

'We’re investing £1.5 billion in our network to be
the first company to offer mobile 4G in the UK, alongside the biggest 
3G network.'

Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said:

'The 4G rollout is a game changer for the mobile market. But the launch of the service on a single network, EE, has already stirred up problems for mobile users when it comes to choosing whether or not to make the leap to super-fast mobile internet or stay put with their current providers.

'As expected, rival networks have waged war on EE in a heated bid to hang onto existing customers, promising discounted mid-contract upgrades to 4G phones in the future, as an alternative to switching to EE right now.

'The first spanner in the works for mobile fans was Vodafone's ad campaign’s claim: "not all 4G networks are the same,"' citing that their eventual roll-out will provide better indoor coverage than that of EE.

The second is the realisation that handsets touted as '4G-ready' could well cause confusion, with different networks using different spectrums to provide the service.

'Our research shows that as many as 45% of Brits think they don't need 4G and 29% don't even know what it is. If the mobile giants want to win customers, they need to make things as jargon-free and transparent to the average consumer as possible – or risk causing even more confusion.'
