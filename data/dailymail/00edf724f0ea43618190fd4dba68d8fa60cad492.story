A Taco Bell patron has been given a heavy-handed etiquette lesson after failing to pardon himself for burping.

Isaiah Morris, 20, claims he was eating with a friend at the South Carolina eatery on Sunday afternoon when an unknown man asked him if 'he had just belched and not said excuse me'.

When Morris asked the man what he said, the man allegedly picked up a chair and hit Morris's left elbow with it, according to a Tega Cay police report obtained by The Smoking Gun.

Morris also alleges the man grabbed him around the throat and tried to head-butt him.

The Smoking Gun reported that Cara Martin, a 17-year-old Taco Bell worker, witnessed the alleged attack and ordered the man to leave the restaurant.

She told police that the assailant drove off in a white vehicle that 'was possibly a pick up', though witnesses were not able to record its tag number.

The police officer, identified in the report as Sgt Larry Neely, observed a 'minor abrasion' on Morrisâ€™s elbow and 'redness around his throat'.

Police have administratively closed the assault and battery case as there was no surveillance footage of the incident. The case could be reopened if leads emerge.
