TLC's latest episode of My Strange Addiction ended last night with an unusual triumph when a male Madonna impersonator finally gave up on his damaging obsession.

Adam Guerra, 27, from Los Angeles, California, has devoted 12 years, endured 18 surgeries, and spent more than $175,000 in his quest to emulate the legendary pop queen; a passion he admits has slid into an addiction.

During the episode, his boyfriend Michael, unable to endure Adam's Madonna fixation any longer, delivers him a frank ultimatum, stating: 'I want to date a boy. I don't want to date a 56-year-old woman.'

During the couple's heart-to-heart, Michael insists he 'really, really' cares for Adam, but that his Madonna addiction is going to 'mess everything up' for the couple.

'I just don't understand,' he pleads. 'Where does it end? You're going to fall into a coma and never wake up?'

Adam, taken aback, responds: 'That's a very harsh way to go with it.' 

His mother Annette Guerra is not a fan of her son's Madonna obsession either. In fact, she admits she 'hates it' and keeps it a secret from all her friends.

That is, until Adam crashes Annette's 'ladies night' drinks party in full Madonna-drag, rendering her friends 'shocked'.

Final touch: Adam wears wigs, heavy make-up and colored contact lenses to look like his favorite pop star

Hook, line and sinker: The 27-year-old Los Angeles native admits that his passion, which includes spending a fortune on Madonna-style outfits, has turned into an addiction

Adam is then lured to a session with dance coach Carlton Wilborn, who was Madonna's back-up performer for two of her world tours.

Thrilled, Adam prances around the studio with Carlton as he learns his idol's famous moves, until it transpires that Carlton's 'real passion' is for life-coaching, and that he wants to help Adam ditch his worrying obsession. 

'I feel in love with Madonna when I was 15,' Adam explains. 

'She just spoke to my soul. I have an addiction to being Madonna. I feel respected when I am Madonna but I don't know who Adam is.'

Carlton coaxes Adam into a toe-curling truth session by inviting him to converse with himself in the dance studio mirror as he caresses his own face.

A single tear trickles down Adam's face as he states: 'I am Madonna. But I want to be Adam.'

He then wrenches off his wig and breaks into dramatic sobs as Carlton comforts him.

TLC concludes: 'After his breakdown, Adam decided to go back to being himself full time. He's sold his collection of Madonna outfits and moved in with his boyfriend.'

Happy ending? He breaks into dramatic sobs as Carlton comforts him. TLC concludes that after this 'breakdown', Adam  decided to go back to being himself full time and moved in with his boyfriend

This isn't Adam's first brush with reality TV, but if he really does give up his addiction, it may well be his last.

In 2011, he appeared in one episode of RuPaul's Drag Race, a TV show created to find 'America's next drag superstar'.

Despite having spent more than $100,000 on Madonna costumes over the years, Adam was eliminated from the show for having 'a poorly-executed outfit.'

And last May, he recorded a single about the joys of 'being plastic' with fellow cosmetic surgery addict Toby Sheldon, 34, who has spent more than $100,000 to look like Justin Bieber and has also appeared on My Strange Addiction.

Toby, to date, is still fixated with transforming himself into his favorite pop star.
