Tottenham Hotspur have not yet asked West Ham United permission to use the Olympic Stadium, but Karren Brady said they'd be barking up the wrong tree regardless.

Daniel Levy’s Spurs face relocating during the 2017/18 season and there remains uncertainty where they will be playing, with both stadium:mk and Wembley also mooted.

The Hammers - who are due to move out of Upton Park in 2016 - have a veto as to who can be housed in Stratford, with vice-chairman Brady scoffing at suggestions their London rivals could share.

'In reality they probably could – but only with our permission,' she said when asked if another club could move in.

'No-one has asked us for our permission and if they did we would probably say no, depending on who it is – if you get my drift.

Sam Allardyce's side have been awarded a 99-year lease to become tenants of the London 2012 venue and are set to leave Upton Park for the 54,000-seater stadium in August 2016. 

Spurs face moving for 12 months, with a number of venues being mooted - including stadium:mk in Milton Keynes.

Brady also confirmed that the club would not receive any money from external events such as pop concerts, while next year's rugby World Cup's fixtures will not be used as dress rehearsals for the following year.

'There will be lots of issues with that stadium. It'll be a shell of a stadium and won't be the finished article,' she added.

West Ham are trying to build a squad capable of European football for manager Sam Allardyce

West Ham's main objective is to become a team capable of consistently finishing in the Premier League's top six and there is a belief that the revenue from the new stadium will help the manager create a side capable of challenging for European qualification.

Brady was talking at the launch of West Ham's new members' club - 'Club London' which offers fans the chance to experience what Brady labelled as an 'unrivalled hospitality experience'.

Season ticket holders and members will soon be able to visit the new Reservation Centre at Westfield Stratford City to hand-pick their new seats at the Olympic Stadium.
