Senator Charles Schumer has proposed a new law that would fit autistic children with GPS tracking chips

A U.S. senator has proposed a new law in the name of the disabled teenager who was found dead in New York earlier this month, which would fit autistic children with tracking devices.

Charles Schumer said ‘Avonte’s Law’- named after autistic 14-year old Avonte Oquendo, who died after wandering out of the confines of his Long Island City school on October 4 - would make it easier for authorities to find children with the disability who had gone astray.

Under the proposed legislation, a state-funded voluntary scheme would see children’s clothes fitted with a small GPS system.

Standing with Avonte’s mother, Vanessa Fontaine, and grandmother, Doris McCoy, on Sunday, Senator Schumer said the family was going through a “nightmare” and that steps needed to be taken to prevent a similar incident happening again.

Avonte, who had a form of autism that made him nonverbal, had been missing since October 4, when he walked out of his school toward a park overlooking a river.

His body was found about 11 miles from where he vanished in New York’s East River earlier this month after his disappearance sparked a massive citywide search that saw volunteers join forces with police.

In a program that would cost around $10 million and be overseen by the Justice Department, schools and parents would be issued with tiny GPS chips. Currently in the US a similar system is used for locating Alzheimer sufferers.

'There is no reason the same program that's been successful with elderly people with Alzheimer's who wander cannot be used for kids like Avonte who have autism and wander,' Senator Schumer said in New York in remarks carried by The Wall Street Journal. 'The only barrier is the funding.'

David Perecman, the lawyer for Avonte’s family, backed the proposal which he said could save lives.

Hundreds of grieving relatives, friends and sympathetic strangers came together Saturday for a funeral marking the tragic end of a three-month search for the missing autistic New York City teen.

The former Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, Cardinal Edward Egan, presided over the ceremony at the Church of Saint Joseph as Avonte's parents and brothers sat stoically in a front pew, next to a white casket holding the remains of the body pulled from the East River.

‘This morning we are grateful to God for Avonte Oquendo, for his life, for his courage, and for the acts of goodness and kindness that his life and his tragic disappearance evoked among us,’ Egan said.

‘We know that he is safely in the embrace of the father in heaven and we thank that father in heaven for the years we had with him in our midst.’

Outpouring of support: Dozens of the volunteers who handed out flyers with Avonte's picture on them and helped the search effort were on hand at the church Saturday

Act of charity: Greenwich Village Funeral Home covered the costs of the service and a family-only wake

A
 funeral home covered the costs of the service and a family-only wake 
beforehand, where about a hundred relatives sat together in a room full 
of white flowers watching a slideshow of the teen's photos.

‘Nobody
 really wanted to speak,’ said Roberto Colon, 49, whose wife's cousin is
 Avonte's mother. ‘We couldn't fathom what to say.’

Vanessa Fontaine wept through the entire service, and neither she nor Avonte's other relatives spoke.

'It was like complete silence, it was very sad,' family friend Leslie Burch told the New York Daily News.

Actress
 and one-time Celebrity Apprentice star Holly Robinson Peete, who has an
 autistic child of her own, flew out to New York City from California to
 attend Avonte's funeral.

'Headed to NYC to celebrate the life of another angel,' she tweeted to her 400,000 followers hours before the service.

Investigators are still trying to determine how Avonte died and further tests are needed to determine the cause and manner of death, officials have said.

Mr Perecman filed a notice of claim in October, the first step in suing the city, and has publically listed a number of mistakes he alleges contributed to the boy's disappearance and what he has described as a flawed search effort.

The city's law department has called the boy's death a tragedy and said its attorneys will review a lawsuit when it's filed.

Case solved: The child's remains, including a skull, were found about 11 miles from where he vanished

Margaret Coaxume, who did not know Avonte or his family, brought her 15-year-old autistic son Elijah Thompson to the funeral because, she said, like so many she had closely followed the heartbreaking story of Avonte's disappearance and death.

‘It's a tragedy,’ she said, as mourners placed white roses on the casket inside a hearse that was to take Avonte's body to a crematorium after the service. ‘My heart is heavy.'
