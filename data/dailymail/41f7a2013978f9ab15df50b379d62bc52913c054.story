Turkish Muslims have declared victory after toy makers Lego agreed to withdraw a Star Wars product which allegedly depicted a mosque.

Critics claimed that the Jabba's Palace model, part of Lego's Star Wars range, was offensive to Muslims as it resembled the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul - one of the world's most renowned mosques.

The Lego set is based on the home of 
Jabba the Hutt, a central character in the Star Wars series, who lives 
in a domed palace, with a separated watchtower.

Toy: The Jabba's Palace Lego set will cease to be produced from 2014 after the Turkish Cultural Community of Austria group described it as offensive to the Muslim community

Criticism: The group criticised Lego's design saying it resembles the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul, one of the world's most recognisable mosques

As well as bearing a likeness to the Hagia
 Sophia mosque, the Turkish group also claimed the toy was designed based on the Jami al-Kabir mosque in Beirut with the watchtower resembling a minaret.

The set of blocks featured Jabba the 
Hutt, a slug-like shisha-smoking alien from the Star Wars films, and an 
oriental domed building housing rockets and machine guns.

The character of Jabba, which features in the toy aimed at children 
aged from nine to 14, keeps Princess
 Leia in chains for use as his personal slave in the Star Wars films.

A statement posted on the 
organisation's website referred to Jabba the Hutt as a 'terrorist' and 
said that he 'likes to smoke hookah and have his victims killed'.

It added: 'It
 is clear that the ugly figure of Jabba and the whole scene smacks of 
racial prejudice and vulgar insinuations against Asians and Orientals as
 people with deceitful and criminal personalities.'

The statement said that the figures in the set are made to resemble 'terrorists, criminals and murderers'.

Comparisons: A post appeared on the group's website pointing out features of the Lego set and comparing them to the Istanbul mosque

The case came to light when a Turkish man
 expressed his dissatisfaction with the toy after it was purchased for 
his son by a family member.

Lego initially refused to remove the Jabba's Palace toy from the shelves claiming it was an entirely fictional creation.

Lego's Katharina Sasse said:'We
 regret that the product has caused the members of the Turkish cultural 
community to come to a wrong interpretation, but point out that when 
designing the product only the fictional content of the Star Wars saga 
were referred to.'

But following a meeting between 
Turkish community leaders and Lego executives it was agreed that 
production of the toy would end from 2014 onwards.

Birol Killic, the
 president of the TCA, said in a statement: 'We are very grateful and 
congratulate Lego on the decision to take Jabbaâ€™s Palace out of 
production.'

Lego was not available for comment yesterday. There was no explanation why the game was not scheduled for immediate withdrawal.

The Hagia Sophia was first built around 360AD in the Byzantium capital Constantinople, later Istanbul.

It served as an Eastern Orthodox Cathedral and was the world's largest for nearly a thousand years, until Seville Cathedral was completed in 1520.In 1453, Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Turks under Sultan Mehmed II, who ordered the building converted into a mosque.Christian symbols such as the bells and altar were removed and many of the mosaics were plastered over. Islamic features, such as the four minarets, were added while it was in the possession of the Ottomans.It remained a mosque until 1931 when it was closed to the public for four years. It re-opened in 1935 as a museum by the Republic of Turkey.It is famous for its massive dome and is considered the crowning achievement of Byzantine architecture. Some experts say it 'changed the history of architecture'.
