Thin-haired with a large nose and deep-set eyes, it is the unremarkable face of a man who may be the most notorious murderer in history.

Astonishingly, it is also the first time anyone has attempted to put together an e-fit of Carl Feigenbaum, one of the men most likely to be Jack the Ripper.

The 54-year-old German merchant seaman went to the electric chair in New York in 1894 after the brutal murder of his landlady Juliana Hoffman.

E-fit: Carl Feigenbaum was a German sailor who expert Trevor Marriott believes was Jack the Ripper

SIR JOHN WILLIAMSHe was an obstetrician, someone who specialises in pregnancy and women’s reproductive tracts, and treated Queen Victoria’s daughter Princess Beatrice.

One of his descendants, Tony Williams, put him forward as the Ripper in 2005 book Uncle Jack, which he co-wrote with Humphrey Price.

Their argument is that he killed the women as part of his research into infertility.

ROBERT MANNHistorian Mei Trow points the finger at mortuary attendant Robert Mann. He was well educated in anatomy, lived locally and came from a poor background.

The first two victims, Polly Nichols and Annie Chapman, are known to have been delivered to his mortuary.

He killed the women after being driven insane by syphilis, according to an article in The Criminologist in 1970 by Dr Thomas E A Stowell.

MONTAGUE JOHN DRUITTDruitt was a barrister who came under suspicion because he committed suicide just after the final murder. However, he lived in Kent – and most Ripper experts believe the suspect was local to Whitechapel.

DR THOMAS NEILL CREAMCream, a doctor specialising in abortions, was hanged in 1892 for several murders he committed in London and his last words were reportedly ‘I am Jack…’.

A psychopath with a self-confessed penchant for mutilating women, even his own lawyer believed he was the Ripper.

Now, to mark the 123rd anniversary of the first murder, Ripper expert Trevor Marriott has composed his portrait from a detailed description made when he was admitted to prison.

And if the former murder squad detective is correct, it may finally put a face to this most elusive of murderers.

Mr Marriot put together the picture for a BBC documentary which airs tonight and identifies Feigenbaum as the man most likely to be Jack.

He comprehensively reviewed the five key murders of prostitutes Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly.

He then got on the trail of his suspect after investigating groups of people who may have been in Whitechapel at the time of the killings, which took place between August and November 1888.

These included sailors as the district - famed for its prostitutes and taverns - is just a short distance from London's docks.

Mr Marriott began examining crew lists for ships that were in dock in the autumn of 1888.

It was then he had a breakthrough. Feigenbaum, already among 200 names in the frame, had been aboard a boat called the Reiher, which had been in the East End in the critical period.

For Mr Marriott, the puzzle began to piece itself together.

Gaps in the killings indicated the perpetrator had been a traveller. Feigenbaum had admitted he was overcome by the desire to mutilate women.

And then there was his lawyer's dramatic statement after his execution at Sing Sing jail.

'I believe that Carl Feigenbaum, whom you have just seen put to death in the electric chair, can easily be connected with the Jack the Ripper murders in Whitechapel, London,' William Lawton told reporters.

'I will stake my professional reputation that if the police will trace this man's movements carefully for the last few years their investigations will lead them to London and to Whitechapel.'

He detailed a confession Feigenbaum made late one night.

'I have for years suffered from a singular disease, which induces an all absorbing passion,' the prisoner told him.

'This passion manifests itself in a desire to kill and mutilate every woman who falls in my way.

'At such times I am unable to control myself.'

Lawton believed his client had 
intended to mutilate landlady Mrs Hoffman, 56. But she screamed so much 
as he cut her throat that, fearing he would be caught, he fled.

Police quickly captured him. He was put to death on April 27 1896 but the execution was not without drama.

Officials gave him three huge bolts of
electricity, administering the final burst as they did not believe he 
was alive - but neither were they convinced that he was dead.

There are many, however, who doubt that Feigenbaum was actually Jack the Ripper.

Little is known about his life beyond the thinnest of details and prosecutor Vernon M.S. Davis described him as a 'cunning fellow, surrounded by a great deal of mystery'.

The most concrete information is his physical description, catalogued so carefully on the Sing Sing remand form. 

He had  grey eyes, dark brown hair and
a 'medium sized head' with a hat size of 6 7/8 or 7, stood  5ft4½ tall 
and weighed 126lbs.

The prison official noted he had thin hair on the top of his head and a slim neck.

'Eyes small and deep-set,' he noted. 'Eyebrows curved. Forehead high and heavily arched.

'Nose large, red and has raw pimples. Teeth poor and nearly all gone on left sides.

'Anchor in india ink on right hand at base of thumb and first finger.

'Round scar or birthmark on right leg below left knee.'

Feigenbaum appears to have had a number of aliases, living as an itinerant seaman across Europe and America.

And it is his relatively humble profession that make many believe he could not possibly been the Ripper.

It
has usually been presumed that the surgical precision of the 
mutilations indicated a killer with intimate knowledge of the human 
anatomy.

However, Mr Marriot
argues that the removal of the women's organs may actually have taken 
place in at the mortuary, the body parts reserved for medical training.
