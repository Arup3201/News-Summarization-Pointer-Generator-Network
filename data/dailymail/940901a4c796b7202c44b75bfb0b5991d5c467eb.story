A series of disturbing cell phone videos have been released in which a Florida teen boasts about his plot to blow up a Tampa high school, vowing that his attack would be bigger than 9/11.

Jared Cano was charged with plotting a massacre at Freedom High School in August 2011 after police found bomb-making material, including fuses, timers, shrapnel, accelerant and plastic tubing at his home.

In the chilling, newly released footage, the teen declares: 'You don't even f***ing know terror yet, 9/11 - I don't give a f***, I'm going to outdo every single one of them...'

According to ABC News, the teen filmed a series of four cell phone clips in the run up to his plot, which was thwarted after another teen tipped off police.

He says: 'For those of you retards who don't know who I am, I'm the Freedom High School shooter in Tampa, Florida. Well I will be in a couple months.'

He goes on to describe his elaborate killing plans.

'My plan is to set a bomb here at point A, here at point B, point C and point D. Then I got to get to the side entrance of the school by 7:24. The bombs blow at 7:26.'

He is seen on the tape smoking what looks like marijuana as he explains how he intends to kill as many students as possible.

Speaking over footage of burning newspaper, he gloats: 'This is a symbol of what all you guys are going to feel.'

The student, who was expelled from Freedom High School in March 2010, explains how he will specifically target two teachers because they had wronged him and wanted to spare the life of another teacher, who he liked.

'(I'll) come through the door then shoot everybody at the front desk,' he says. 'Mr Costanzo's office is right here, I've got to kill him. Mrs Carmody is here I've got to kill her. Mr Pears is here, I've got to make sure he doesn't die, because I like him.'

He then planned to retrieve a hoard of weapons he had placed near the school before coming back in and inflicting further carnage.

'I'm going to come in and advance on the courtyard where there'll probably be at least sixty people,' he says.

He then went on to say the bomb plot was inevitable.

'There's
nothing I can do about it, there's nothing anybody can do about it 
other than wait for it to unleash. If you don't like it just find a way 
to find people like me and just line us up and shoot us.'

Police
thwarted what they called a 'catastrophic' plot by the expelled 
student on the first day of school in August 2011.

He was arrested at his mother's home after someone tipped off authorities about the meticulously planned plot.

In his bedroom, officers found 
materials to make pipe bombs, including a fuel source, shrapnel, plastic
tubing and timing and fusing devices.

Officers also found a journal containing schematic drawings of rooms inside the school and statements about his intent to kill, which were shown in the videos. They also found marijuana growing operation in his home.

Mr Cano had written a detailed manifesto, outlining a minute by minute guide to his planned killing spree.

He is also said to have written that he 'wanted to do something that was more spectacular than Columbine'.

Mr Cano was charged with possessing bomb-making materials, threatening to throw, project, place or discharge a destructive device, cultivating marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of marijuana.

Authorities said he had been arrested multiple times in the past. Charges have included burglary, carrying a concealed weapon, altering serial numbers on a firearm and drug possession. All have been either dismissed or no action has been taken.

When Mr Cano was arrested he repeated his plan to discharge a bomb and cause mass casualties at the school. Mr Cano has being held in secure detention since his arrest.

'We were probably able to thwart a potentially catastrophic event the likes of which the city of Tampa has not seen and hopefully never will,' Police Chief Jane Castor said after the man was arrested.

She said Mr Cano had hoped 'to cause more casualties than were suffered at Columbine' in his attack.

In April 1999, two students at the Columbine High School in Colorado killed 12 students and one teacher in one of the deadliest school massacres in U.S. history.
