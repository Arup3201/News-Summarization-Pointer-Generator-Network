A tiny French village has been rocked by the news thatÂ its recently elected mayor has been castrated and killed by a jealous love rival who accused him of having an affair with his wife.

The barbaric killing of Dominque 
Leboucher, 55, has been greeted with horror in the small Normandy 
village of Bretteville-le-Rabet, 10 miles south of Caen.

Mr Leboucher's mutilated body was found lying in a pool of blood at his home close to the town hall, where he had been based since being elected mayor in March this year.

Sealed-off: Detectives have said the primary line of enquiry in their murder investigation is an extramarital affair. The barbaric killing of Dominque Leboucher, 55, has been greeted with horror in the village

A local police spokesman said the killing happened sometime between late yesterday evening and early this morning.

Mr Leboucher is said to have been having an affair with the wife of another villager, who got hold of a knife and attacked the mayor at his home.

The murderer then ran into a nearby field and committed suicide, a source close to the criminal enquiry said.

Albert 
Gibot, a villager, said the alleged killer was 'happily settled' with a
 local councillor with whom he had two young daughters.

Mr Gibot said he had 'blown a fuse as his partner used to attend meetings of the local council in the evenings.'

As council officials tried to play down 
the significance of the alleged love triangle, detectives confirmed that
 the primary line of enquiry in their murder investigation is an 
extramarital affair.

'I do not believe this thing about infidelity at all... It was an act of madness, Yannick Guesnon, one of the late mayor's deputies was quoted as saying.

Mr Leboucher first worked in insurance sales before becoming a councillor in 2001.

He took up the post of deputy mayor of Bretteville-le-Rabet in 2008, and was became mayor himself in municipal elections in March.

His election slogan

'He
 was a lovely, friendly man who was massively popular with everbody. Everybody in the village is in a state of 
shock,' one villager said.

Bretteville-le Rabet, a commune in the Calvados department, is 10 miles from the city of Caen, and had a population of about 250.
