A customer who rented a car for a one-day trip in Virginia wound up with a $3,374 bill thanks to a blown tire, while another was hit with a $780 charge for a broken bumper he had no idea about.

A third was charged an extra five days in rental fees after bringing her car back after-hours - because they say it took them that long to find the vehicle.

The fat fees are cautionary tales against straying from the fine print in rental agreements, which can lead to huge fines for what seem like minor offenses.

Rough ride: Roy Bonney's ride from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington, D.C. almost cost him $3,374

Roy Bonney, the driver whose flat tire struck at the worst possible time, had banked on paying Budget just $96 for his trip from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington, D.C., where he was due to catch a plane.

But, according to dailyfinance.com, Bonney found himself with a flat - and no spare - while he parked in Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling within D.C.

 He tried to summon the company's assistance vehicle and drive off in another car - but the company said the rescue would take so long he'd miss his flight home to Alaska.

So instead he called Budget and asked to leave the car where it was for them to pick up, while he headed off himself.

Claims: Bonney thought Budget had taken back responsibility for a car after he left it in a military base after a tire blew - but they couldn't reach it for weeks, and charged him

Don't be late: Another driver from Manchester, Maryland (pictured) was charged $785 for a broken bumper that wasn't there when he dropped off his car

But when the tow truck arrived, after Bonney had set off, it wasn't allowed on base and was kept away for weeks - resulting in the huge fee for him.

In another case, a 33-year-old man from Manchester, Maryland, took an Alamo car back after business hours, assuming he would be charged the regular fee - or for a late return at worst.

But instead he was contacted by the company saying the car had been 'rear-ended' while technically in his possession - and sent photos of the vehicle with a mangled bumper.

He was hit with a $785 charge to cover the repairs, because the vehicle was his responsibility until it had been officially given back.

A further, unnamed woman was hit with five extra days of fees on her rental after returning a car at 3am. The rental company said they took five days to locate the car, all of which she had to pay for.

A rental industry spokesman said it was the consumer's responsibility to protect themselves from accidents - and make sure their agreements are honored.

The representative, for the American Car Rental Association, said: 'The rule of thumb is that the unit you rented is still on rent and is your responsibility until the office opens and the car is inspected. If damage is found at that time, the renter is charged.'

Although after vigorous complaints, Bonney and the Maryland resident had their jumbo charges waived, experts warn that unless renters stick to the small print religiously, they could be next.
