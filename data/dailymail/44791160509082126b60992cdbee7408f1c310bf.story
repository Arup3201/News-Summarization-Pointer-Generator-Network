After the 28-year-old woman exited a bus in Ypsilanti Township, about 35 miles west of Detroit, around 6pm near the apartment complex where she lives, the men started yelling gay slurs at her. They then began to beat her, leaving her unconscious.

'One of the males stated, "Hey b----. Are you that (anti-gay slur) from the news?"' One of the males then punched her in the face, which knocked her to the ground and unconscious,' according to a news release from the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office. When she awoke, one of the men kicked her torso. The men then fled.

A 28-year-old woman was brutally beaten in a parking lot of the Roundtree Apartment complex in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan by three men who had seen her marry her partner on a TV news segment

'She had obvious visual injuries,' Sgt. Geoffrey Fox of the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office told the Detroit Free Press. 'She had injuries to her eye and around her eye. It was swollen, and she had fresh injuries on her arms and on her torso. The injuries matched exactly what she said had happened. There’s no reason for us not to believe her, and we’ll proceed with the investigation. Everything we see matches what she said.'

Fox added that the men, who have nto been found, would face assault charges. If the subjects are identified and a case built, hate crimes charges could be added.

The sheriff’s office described one of the suspects as a white male in his mid-20s, standing 5-foot-10 to 5-foot-11 and heavyset with a husky voice. The woman was not able to identify the other two assailants.

Several hundred same-sex marriages occurred on March 22 after a U.S. District Court ruled in favor of a lesbian couple who sued to have Michigan’s ban on gay marriage overturned. However, an appeal court has placed a stay on the ruling, stopping the marriages for the time being. For those same-sex couples that did marry, the states is blocking benefits they would be entitled to pending a ruling on the appeal.

Equality Michigan, a gay advocacy group, received at least 100 reports of slurs and assaults against gays and lesbians last year.

'A lot of times, they are just slurs,' Yvonne Siferd, the organization's director of victim services, told the Detroit Free Press. 'Unfortunately, when unchecked, people feel empowered by them and (get physical).'
