From the Empire State Building to the Blue Mosque, plenty of people take photographs of iconic architecture when on holiday.

And now Google Maps’ Panoramio ‘heat map’ of the world allows people to see the most photographed travel destinations.

Three of the five most photographed places on the planet are in the EU, according to the popular service, which lets people tag photos of landmarks and scenery and upload them to Google maps.

New York City is the most photographed place in the world. Rome, Barcelona, Paris and Istanbul make up the rest of the top five most photographed destinations, leading one to suppose that the service is more popular than in some areas of the world than others

According to the website’s heat map, New York City is the most photographed place in the world, or at least more images of New York landmarks and scenes have been uploaded via Panoramio than any other city.

Rome, Barcelona, Paris and Istanbul make up the rest of the top five most photographed destinations, suggesting the service is more popular in some areas of the world than others.

The map shows the most popular photographic locations in yellow, before fading to orange, pink and then purple for slightly less photographed places, making it easy to pick out popular holiday spots, cities and wonders of the world.

London was, unsurprisingly, the most snapped location in the UK and Ireland, followed by Dublin, Stonehenge, Brighton and Bath.

Rome, Barcelona, Paris, Istanbul and Venice were the five most photographed places in Europe, according to the map. Monte Carlo, Florence, Budapest, Prague and Madrid made up the rest of the top ten

However, Britain’s capital missed out on a spot in Europe’s top five most photographed sights, which comprised: Rome, Barcelona, Paris, Istanbul and Venice.

The top five photographed cities or sites in North America are: New York, Niagara Falls, Chicago, San Francisco and Havana, while Buenos Aires is the most snapped in South America, followed by: Sao Paulo, Mexico City, Ipanema – a beach resort south of Rio - and Iguazu Falls.

Photos shared via Panoramio can be viewed as a layer on Google Earth and Google Maps and the map was created based on the number of Panoramio photos at each place in the world.

The hottest places have markers linking photos, Street View, Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Foursquare and Google Plus articles about the site.

Google Maps' Panoramio 'heatmap' of the world allows people to see the most photographed travel destinations and seven of the top 10 are in the geographical area of Europe, perhaps suggesting that the service is most popular in this continent

The five most photographed sites, according to the 'heatmap' are: Harmandir Sahib, the Red Fort, Jaipur, the Taj Mahal and the site of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. There are relatively few 'hot' yellow areas in India compared to in Europe, leading one to surmise that the service is not as popular in this part of the world

The service asks users to organise images using geotags, such as Paris, or Eiffel Tower, which enable searchers to find images of a destination or subject matter easily.

Users can search the map to highlight top places in a given area, including most photographed 1,000 locations in the world or given country.

Shanghai was the most photographed place in Asia, followed by Beijing, Kowloon, Tokyo and Bangkok, while Johannesburg was the most documented in Africa, followed by Ethekwini (which includes Durban), Simon’s Town, Kruger Park and the Knysna Heads – an infamous spot for shipwrecks and part of the ‘Garden route’.

Top top five most snapped sites in North American are: New York, Niagara Falls, Chicago, San Francisco and Havana while Buenos Aires is the most snapped in South America, followed by: Sao Paulo, Mexico City, Ipanema - a beach resort south of Rio - and Iguazu Falls
