A graveyard of brown bears, cruelly slain and mutilated by poachers, has been uncovered in Siberia.

The animals were beheaded and their body parts are believed to have been exported to China as delicacies or for medicinal purposes. 

A hunting expert called in to analyse the horrifying discovery in Buryatia, Russia confirmed that all the bears, including several young creatures, were violently trapped and slain according to the Siberian Times.

Beheaded bears: Nine skulls were found and it is believed that poachers beheaded the brown bears and exported their other body parts to China for delicacies or medicinal purposes

Poachers' work: All were shot at close range in the head which suggests they were caught in illegal bear traps before they were killed

Like Gulag victims of Stalin's political purges, the bears were all shot at close range in the skull after they had been illegally snared in traps. 

Biologist Bimba Yumov said: ‘The brown bears were killed in the most barbaric way.

‘Poachers put the traps out which even the bears cannot escape from then came to finish the animals with the shot to the head.

‘The bears were sitting, trapped, like chained dogs. 

‘This was the only way the poachers could have shot them in the head.’

Final resting place: It is believed that the bears were trapped and killed in a remote location in winter before they were poorly hidden in the frozen ground of the graveyard

Russia's favourite: Russia has the largest brown bear population in the world, and it is one of the most widespread, well-known and popular animals in the country

The biologist said the bear deaths were definitely the work of poachers using traps.

She
 said: 'If it was the usual type of hunting, with the bear freely 
walking around, they would not have been able to get the animals in 
their heads, it is extremely unlikely. They would aim at other parts of 
their bodies.

‘I am 100 per cent confident that 
this was the work of poachers. You will not otherwise have nine skulls 
with identical type of bullet shots.’

The
 bears were found in the macabre forest cemetery 'skinned and their paws
 hacked off. Fat and bile was also removed', it is claimed.  

Graveyard location: The remains were found in Ulan-Ude, the capital city of the Republic of Buryatia, Russia

They were slain last winter, say experts. 

According
 to the Siberian Times: ‘The fear is that the poaching was undertaken as
 an order from the Chinese black market where bear products have a high 
value as delicacies and for medicinal purposes.

‘The remains were most likely brought to the “graveyard” in winter and not hidden properly in the frozen ground. 

‘The
 animals were found close to a suburb of the Buryatian capital of 
Ulan-Ude, but it is likely they were trapped and killed in a more remote
 location.’

All that was left: Only the bear skulls were found. They were skinned, had their paws hacked off, and fat and bile removed it has been claimed

Mushroom pickers made the gruesome discovery and alerted the local Channel 5 TV station in regional capital Ulan-Ude. 

Police doubt the poachers will ever be identified and punished. 

Recently, in a separate case, customs officers close to the Russian-Chinese border detained a Mercedes with 115 bear paws. 

It is estimated that black market price for a kilogram of brown bear's paw is about US$1000.

Spokesman for Blagoveschensk Customs Vitaliy Shabanov said: ‘We catch this kind of illegal cargo once every three months. 

‘It is one of the most widespread types of smuggling here.’

Russia has the largest brown bear population in the world, and it is one of the most widespread, well-known and popular animals in the country.
