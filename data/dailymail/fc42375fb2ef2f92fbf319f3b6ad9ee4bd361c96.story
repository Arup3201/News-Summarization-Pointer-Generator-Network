Cooling off: Showers costing more than £100,000 were installed for ministers and officials to freshen up before work

The taxpayer has spent more than £100,000 on smart new showers for sweaty ministers and officials to freshen up after cycling to work.

The Department for Energy and Climate Change splashed out on a suite of smart ‘shower rooms’ for staff as part of a £300,000 makeover of its Whitehall building.

It also included almost £70,000 on new kitchens, causing Labour to ask: ‘How many kettles does a minister need?’

As one of the newest departments, created by Gordon Brown in 2008, it already has some of the smartest government offices.

But climate change minister Greg Barker has admitted the department has spent £321,000 in the last two years on ‘smaller refurbishments’.

Almost a third of the bill was for ‘various shower installations to improve facilities for cyclists’, ministers have admitted.

The £104,127 shower rooms were ordered
 after eco-friendly officials were encouraged to cycle to work last 
summer to avoid rush how queues during the London Olympics.

It is thought staff were unhappy at 
the sight of sweaty cyclists arriving for work at 3 Whitehall Place 
without having had a shower.

But Labour vice-chairman Michael 
Dugher, who obtained the figures, told MailOnline: ‘On average people 
are £1,500 worse off since David Cameron came to power and yet ministers
 in one department have blown nearly a third of a million pounds on 
tarting up their facilities.

‘Over £100,000 on new showers for ministers seems shockingly steep,’ the MP for Barnsley East said.

‘What were they, gold-plated taps? 
Perhaps I can recommend a plumber from Barnsley who could do the job 
cheaper than that next time.’

Staff were encouraged to ride to the Whitehall offices during the 2012 Olympics - but needed somewhere to shower afterwards

Climate change minister said the refurbishment was needed to address 'wear and tear'

Mr Dugher added: ‘Spending almost £70,000 on kitchens seems equally extravagant. How many kettles do ministers need?’

The total refurbishment bill also included £10,000 for the ‘creation’ of an office, £2,800 decorating a basement, almost £18,5000 on painting the floors of a basement, £91,000 on ‘decoration works’, £21,200 on flooring replacements, £2,446.2 on skirting boards.

Tory climate change minister Greg Barker said: 'DECC have not undertaken any large scale building refurbishment work in the last 24 months but has carried out smaller refurbishment projects, primarily to redecorate after wear and tear or to increase the capacity and efficiency of the estate.'

Matthew Sinclair, chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘This is a massive amount of taxpayers’ cash to splash out on refurbishments.

‘Departments across Whitehall can not afford to spend this much on renovations at a time when budgets are tight.

‘It’s important that DECC finds the best deal possible to provide value for taxpayers’ money.’

A DECC spokesperson said: ‘A number of shower rooms have been created in the Department to respond to the increased number of staff cycling to work. 

‘The costs of creating the shower rooms include flooring, tiling and plumbing of the shower cubicles and each of their adjoining changing areas.’
