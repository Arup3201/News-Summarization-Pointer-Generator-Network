A high school yearbook has banned the baby bumps of two pregnant teens and says the images would promote teen pregnancy.

Deonna Harris says she was pulled aside at White Cloud High School in White Cloud, Michigan when she got the news her photo would have to be re-taken.

Harris was shocked. ‘It made me tear up,’ she said. ‘I was trying to hold it back because I didn't want everyone to ask me why I was crying and stuff.’

Belly ban: Deonna Harris, left, and Kimberly Haney, right, had photos of them in which their pregnant bellies showed yanked from the school yearbook

The staff member had been ordered not to use a picture they’d already chosen for The Chieftain’s 2013 edition.

‘She said, “We have to retake this picture.” I was kind of  confused and asked what was wrong with it and she was like, '”Well, the yearbook teacher told me you can't have your belly in, it so we have to retake it,”’ Harris told WOOD-TV Wedneday.

The original photo showed Harris and some friends, including Kimberly Haney, who is also pregnant, in the bed of a truck outside school.

‘It’s not like I was holding my bell,’ said Haney, ‘I wasn’t promoting it in any way. It was just a full body picture.’

Abstinence only: Superintendent Barry Seabrook of White Cloud, Michigan schools told reporters the photos would violate the school's abstinence-only sex ed policy

But promoting it is exactly what school officials say they were doing.

White Cloud schools superintendent Barry Seabrook said Thursday that showing the baby bumps in the year book would amount to a violation of Michigan’s mandate that sex education be abstinence-only.

The girls disagreed and say they’re being discriminated against.

‘What's the difference of letting me walk for graduation, letting me walk around the school? It's the same thing,’ said Haney.

Shotgun: Kimberly Haney and her boyfriend were voted most likely to get married but the yearbook photo, which shows her boyfriend pretending to propose, was banned by administrators

While Superintendent Seabrook agreed that appearing in school and in the year book seemed like the same thing, he also said he feared a backlash from parents.

‘We're not saying they can't have their photos in the yearbook,’ Seabrook explained.

The girls were given the opportunity to reshoot the photos while keeping their pregnancies out of view. They’ve declined to do so.

The photo in the truck will not appear in The Chieftain, nor will one of Haney and her boyfriend, who were voted Most Likely to Get Married.

Unfair? The girls were invited to reshoot photos that hide their bumps, but declined. They say they're being discriminated against while the superintendent says he mostly feared a backlash from parents
