From outside, Simon Edward's home looks like any other flat but close the door and this two bedroom property is covered with murals of scenes from Indiana Jones to Flash Gordon - and they took 13 years to paint.

The amateur artist has spent more than 10,000 hours turning his house into a film set: from a toilet which captures the scenery of Venice to a hallway complete with futuristic fittings and 'insectoid' walls, based on the hit 1979 film Alien.

The flat, which was built in the 1960s, has been valued at £300,000. Every room in the property is covered with murals - apart from the kitchen because, his wife Jo Edwards 'would have killed me,' Mr Edwards said.

As you walk into the flat, this huge mural (left) depicts alien tentacles from the 1979 film Alien. Also in the entrance are these gruesome jaws dripping with saliva

The terrifying scene in the corridor where the walls are painted black and a hand hangs from the ceiling contrasts with the brightly coloured kitchen. The kitchen is the only room not covered in a mural

Simon Edwards imagines he is on an Indiana Jones set as he relaxes in his lounge where even the lamps look like rocks found in the desert. The drawings are so intricate that you can even make out the roots of the trees and the expression on the monkey's face

The murals are incredibly detailed as shown by the texture of the monkey's fur in this picture and the way its hand is clasped around a piece of piece of leaf

The Amazon jungle brought to Mill Hill, London by Simon Edwards. The house has been valued at £300,000 but Mr Edwards has spent just £1,000 on painting materials. The flat is now up for rent. He said: 'You either love it or hate it but it always provokes a reaction. You can probably rule out 95 per cent of people that are looking'

Temple of Doom: The lounge mirrors the set of Indiana Jones action films - but there is no painting of Harrison Ford. The walls are covered with Indian statues morphed with statues and temples from Cambodia - also featured in the 1984 Temple of Doom. Even the door is camouflaged

Sunset on the Temple of Doom: The light flickering against the blue sky mirrors the sun beginning to set against the mural. Mr Edwards said: 'Paint doesn't cost much, and painting costs only time. It's been a fantastic journey and so much fun'

The amateur artist devoted 13 years to turning the property into a piece of art, he worked on the paintings for a total of 10,000 hours. But now, the flat is up for rent for £1,300 pcm

'It would have been too much for me to take off all the cabinet doors and sand them down,' he added.

The flat in Mill Hill, North West London, is now up for rent - but Mr Edwards admits he may some problems finding tenants for the place he compares to Marmite: 'You either love it or hate it but it always provokes a reaction,' he said.

'You can probably rule out 95 per cent of people that are looking.

'It would have to be someone who likes 
art, with a quirky personality, and probably someone who likes travel 
and films or just crazy ideas,' he added.

Not your average dining room: This is the room where Mr and Mrs Edwards eat dinner. Mr Edwards said that his friends like the murals in the house but he admits that they are 'like Marmite'

Simon Edwards stands at the table that he eats at every evening. He has spent years turning the house into a work of art and many of his memories are weaved into the property

The main bedroom is themed around comic strip Flash Gordon. The comic was first created in the 1930s before becoming a hit film in 1980. The walls are covered in characters such as Flash and Hans Zarkov. There are also pictures of Flash and his love interest Dale Arden

This is the room shared by Simon Edwards and his wife Jo. The bedroom walls tell the story of Flash Gordon and even the comic strip captions are written out

From floor to ceiling the bedroom is covered with the key moments from Flash Gordon. Famous quotes include Dale Arden saying: 'Flash! I love you, but we only have 14 hours to save the Earth'

Only the bedroom door is not covered with pictures from the action series. Flash Gordon is set on fictional planet Mango Planet. On the ceiling is the colourful galaxy around the planet

The main bedroom, which Mr Edwards shares with his wife, is the 'Flash Gordon room' complete with scenes from the classic comics on all four of the fours.

The spare bedroom is decked floor to ceiling in a panorama of London submerged in water - to scale. Even the furniture in the bedroom is aquarium-themed with the handles of the drawer chest made out of metal shells.

Entering the lounge is like being transported onto the set of Indiana Jones. Murals depict the Amazon jungle, temples, vines and elaborate trees - but there is no Harrison Ford peeping out from behind.

Hieroglyphics include these comical pictures such as a Pharaoh showering, carved outside the bathroom and another of a toilet, also outside the bathroom. He has also created hieroglyphic images of his friends faces. He said: 'I
 have written each of their names in hieroglyphics in the Egyptian 
hallway so they love coming over and pointing it out to people'

Maze: This is the wacky hallway in Simon Edward's flat which looks like the inside of a pyramid with its sand-coloured paint and intricate carvings into the walls

From outside, the purpose-built 1960s block looks like any normal residential building. In fact, behind its doors is the wacky two-bedroomed flat covered in weird and wonderful artwork

Even when entering the toilet, the room takes you to Venice, the scene of The Talented Mister Ripley. The toilet door has been decorated and turned into a painting of Venice with its canals and terracotta colours.

Mr Edwards, a 43-year-old business analyst, has only spent some £1,000 on paint and art supplies for the flat.

He said: 'Paint doesn't cost much, and painting costs only time. It's been a fantastic journey and so much fun.'

The couple are now moving out of the 
flat because Mr Edwards wants to start painting another flat 'all over 
again' on a 'blank canvas'.

But the artist admits that he will be sad to leave: 'It's a very unusual flat, not to everybody's taste, but I love it.

'If my wife didn't like it I guess she wouldn't be with me. And my friends love it.

This stunning doorway looks like a window with a view of a Venice canal. In fact, this is the bathroom door. Venice is the scene of The Talented Mr Ripley

From Venice to underwater London: The scene in the spare bedroom shows London underwater. Buildings such as Big Ben and the London Eye are depicted in detail and everything is located exactly as it would be on a map

Underwater London from the houses of parliament to Big Ben and the river Thames where dolphins, imagined by Simon Edwards, swim through the water

Parts of the wall look like coral reefs where fish are hiding in the blue water. The lighting is also blue-coloured in the spare bedroom

This picture was taken while the mural was still under construction and shows the outlines of London's buildings

'I
 have written each of their names in hieroglyphics in the Egyptian 
hallway so they love coming over and pointing it out to people.'

Mark Nasab, from Cosway Estate Agents, the company marketing the flat said:

'I've never seen anything like this before - it's such an incredible property.

'I think I'm safe in saying that there isn't anything else like this in the whole of London.

'People will either love it or hate it - and I don't know if there will be many people out there who will want to rent it.

'But it is a special flat and there will be some tenants who will be fascinated by the art work.

'It will be a challenge to find the right tenant but every house has a buyer, and there is someone to rent every property.'

Under construction: These pictures show the flat under construction. Mr Edwards attached wire mesh to the walls to create the tentacles. To the right is the wall before it became an underwater London
