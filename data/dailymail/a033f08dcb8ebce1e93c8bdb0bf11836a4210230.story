A grieving man recently widowed was so moved by seeing a young couple enjoying each other's company while out dining on Tuesday that he paid for their meal in a very generous ‘pay it forward’ gesture.

The heart-warming incident happened at an unnamed restaurant in Barrie, Ontario, where Lee Ballantyne was dining alone for the first time since his wife Carol had passed away from cancer on December 30.

As Lee watched the young couple and reflected on his 43 years of marriage he was so inspired that he wrote the couple a touching note on a napkin and paid their check. 

Lee Ballantyne, the grieving husband who paid for a young couple's dinner last week in Barrie, Ontario, because they reminded him of his recently deceased wife Carol, has modestly described his kind-hearted act as a 'selfish' gesture so he would feel better

‘You don't know me, but my beautiful wife of 43 years died last week. Tonight I dined alone for the first time. You remind me of us many years ago. Please allow me to buy your dinner. It will put a smile on Carol's face and make me happy... for now,’ he wrote.

The touching gesture has come to light after a photo of the napkin was posted on the social media site Reddit by user Turboturtle08, who explained that his friend owned the restaurant and that she had taken the photo after talking to the very grateful couple, who haven’t been named.

When the note was initially posted on Reddit it attracted a mixed response from other posters, many of whom questioned its authenticity.

This prompted the Ballantyne’s son Jason, who posts as Axe34, to respond to the internet trolls and confirm that the note was indeed authentic and the incident had really happened. 

‘I know this won't convince those who don't want to believe it could be true but here's the deal,’ wrote Jason. 

Carol and Lee Ballantyne were high school sweethearts who married in 1970, she was diagnosed with lung cancer last Sept and died on Dec 30

‘Mom died on Dec. 30. Dad went to dinner last night [Tuesday] and then told me this morning about what he did. A friend sent us the link to the photo that had been uploaded here. It's all true. That's my dad's abysmal handwriting.’

In another post, Jason explained that he had written about his mom’s death because it helped him ‘process his feelings’ and he posted links to his personal blog and to his mom’s obituary.

‘I'm posting a link in the hopes it might help some of those so quick to dismiss the loss of a loved one see that not only is the story true but it's about real people dealing with a devastating loss,’ he wrote.

Carol Ballantyne, who was 62, died over the holidays after being diagnosed with lung cancer in September.

In her obit, Carol was remembered as a ‘loving and nurturing mother and grandmother.’

She and her husband had been high school sweethearts, who had married in 1970 and gone on to have three sons and five grandchildren, ‘her pride and joy’.

Carol was remembered as ‘a talented artist, an avid gardener, a seamstress who made clothes for her children, and an excellent cook and baker.’

Her funeral took place on January 5.

Lee Ballantyne has been described as a ‘strong, compassionate man’ by his friend and former colleague Chris Malette, who is a journalist for The Belleville Intelligence.

In his weekly column, Malette revealed that Lee had told his Facebook friends about his kind gesture on Wednesday.

‘Lee wasn't looking for accolades, just wanted to share his way of spreading the love and grieving in his own way,’ wrote Malette.

He also wrote that the ‘inspirational’ gesture of kindness had made him proud to call Lee a friend.

‘Many of us struggle with the loss of a loved one. Lee and Carol were an inspiration in coping – most always, at least to us friends and family – with a smile and a kind word, caring always about how the rest of us were faring.

‘Now he moves on to a new chapter in his life without his dear wife and it's heartening to see he's taking the next steps on the wings of an angel.’
