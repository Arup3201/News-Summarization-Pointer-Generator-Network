Jordan Henderson will miss Liverpool’s attempts to reach the Europa League’s last 16 because of an ankle problem.

The England midfielder sat out training on Wednesday morning and will not travel to Istanbul with the rest of Brendan Rodgers’ squad.

Henderson has been in excellent form recently and Liverpool hope the extra rest will ensure that he is fit for Sunday’s crucial Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester City.

Henderson was not the only high-profile absentee from the session at Melwood before Liverpool headed off to Turkey, where they will aim to protect the 1-0 advantage Mario Balotelli’s penalty gave them last week.

Glen Johnson was not included nor was Mamadou Sakho, who is recuperating from a hip problem. Steven Gerrard was also missing as he recovers from the hamstring problem that has forced him to miss the last three games.

Otherwise, it was all smiles at Melwood on Wednesday morning as Liverpool stepped up their preparations for the second leg of their last-32 tie.

Ibe, who won the penalty that led to Balotelli's winner, is attracting a lot of attention at the moment, particularly after another eye-catching performance for Liverpool during their 2-0 victory at Southampton on Sunday.

Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher and former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry reflected on his ‘amazing performance' during their analysis for Sky Sports on Sunday.

Ibe began this season on loan at Championship side Derby County, before returning to Liverpool last month and breaking into the first team.

He has since gone on to become a regular, featuring in the last five Premier League games as the Reds have risen impressively back into top-four contention.
