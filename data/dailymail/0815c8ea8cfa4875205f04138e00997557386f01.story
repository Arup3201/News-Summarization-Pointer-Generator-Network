He told CBS Miami: 'That's called assault. Threatening to kill.

'His attitude was that this is his religious responsibility of carrying out killing infidels.'

Chaar, 24, admitted shouting 'Alluha Akbar' but denied threatening to behead the men in an interview with Local 10 after he was released from custody on bond.

He said: 'This is not a hate crime.

'This has nothing to do with them being Jewish. I just want to help them find peace within themselves.

'I don't want them to burn in eternal hell forever.'

He said he converted to Islam three years ago while in prison on drug charges.

He faces charges of assault with religious prejudice and stalking.

Extra security has been put in place at the synagogue to protect members.
