A group of passengers from a JetBlue flight which was forced to make an emergency landing after the pilot suffered a midair meltdown have filed a lawsuit against both the airline and the pilot, it has emerged.

The suit, filed by 10 passengers of JetBlue flight 191, accuses the airline of failing to properly supervise the pilot, Clayton Osbon.

Osbon, 49, who lives near Savannah, Georgia, had to be physically restrained after running through the cabin yelling about Jesus and Al-Qaida during a New York to Las Vegas flight on March 27.

Legal action: A group of passengers from a JetBlue flight which was forced to make an emergency landing after pilot Clayton Osbon, pictured, suffered a midair meltdown have filed a lawsuit against both the airline and the pilot

He has also been charged by federal authorities with interfering in the operations of a flight crew, which was forced to land in Amarillo, Texas.

The court papers said JetBlue 'was grossly negligent in retaining defendant Osbon, whom JetBlue knew or should have known was unfit to be entrusted with the aircraft as pilot.'Â 

The suit, which was filed in New York State Supreme Court in the Queens borough of New York City, seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.

Plaintiff Michael Bedziner, 48, of Commack, N.Y, who was headed to a conference of security consultants, said that since the September 11 attacks, he has often looked around airplane cabins, suspicious of who may be a terrorist.

'But you always look to the airline crew and say, "OK, this is a group I can turn to and say we're safer."

'What does this tell us? Now the very people that we're supposed to turn to for that assurance are the ones we're frightened of. And the pilot, no less.'

Richard Signoretti, 48, of Rosedale, N.Y., had his eyes closed and was listening to music when the woman next to him poked him to get his attention after the trouble started.

Outnumbered: The captain was subdued thanks to the help of passengers on the flight 'packed with burly men' heading to the 2012 International Security Conference in Las Vegas

'What I got from him was, "You're not going to make it to Las Vegas."

'It was extremely frightening, it was extremely unnerving. I still haven't gotten a good night's sleep,' Mr Signoretti said

The FBI says that while he was at the controls of the Airbus A320 about halfway into the five-hour flight, Osbon said, 'Things just don't matter,' and told the flight's first officer, 'We're not going to Vegas.'

The pilot suddenly left the cockpit and started running up and down the aisle in a wild rant, banging on a restroom door, and attempted to force his way back into the cockpit, which by then had been locked by the co-pilot, First Officer Jason Dowd.

The lawsuit claims he was 'yelling about September 11th, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Al-Qaida and terrorists.'

Other comments, according to the suit, included: 'We're all going down,' 'you better start praying right now,' 'I'm going to show you Iraq and Iran right now,' 'there's a bomb on board,' and 'the plane will never make it to Vegas.'

Several passengers restrained Osbon while Mr Dowd safely landed the plane.

A flight attendant's ribs were bruised as passengers tried to restrain Osbon, but no one on board was seriously injured.

JetBlue has not yet reviewed the suit and has a policy against commenting on pending litigation, company spokeswoman Alison Croyle said.

Attorneys Jonathan Reiter and Steve Epstein, who represent the 10 plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said they intend to seek information on whether there were any indications Osbon had shown signs of mental instability before March 27.

'We're going to have to delve into that,' Mr Reiter said. "That is one of the things this lawsuit is about."

Osbon faces a hearing Friday morning in Amarillo to determine if he is mentally competent to stand trial.

He faces federal charges of interfering with a flight crew. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.
