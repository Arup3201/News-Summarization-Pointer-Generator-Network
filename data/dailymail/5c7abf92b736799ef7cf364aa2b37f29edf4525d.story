Real ale enthusiasts are raising their glasses after a rare opportunity to craft beer barrels has come up for the first time this century.

Renowned brewer Theakston's is taking on an apprentice cooper to help them make and and repair the traditional oak casks they use to store and transport their classic ales.

Classed as one of the rarest jobs in the real ale industry, the lucky individual will be the only apprentice brewery cooper in the country.

Only one person will be chosen to learn from Jonathan Manby, pictured here working in his specialised field

Dying art: The role of cooper is considered one of the rarest jobs in the real ale industry, and the successful applicant will be taught by Mr Manby, the country's last remaining brewery-employed craft cooper

The cooper profession dates back centuries and the tools used handed down through generations

The chosen one will undergo a three to four year training period in order to produce, re-make and repair the family-owned brewery's wooden casks.

They will learn the craft from Jonathan Manby - who joined Theakston's as an apprentice himself in 1995 - and is the country's last remaining brewery-employed craft cooper.

Mr Manby, 39, makes hundreds of oak casks each year for licensees that insist on having their ales served that way.

He also demonstrates his skills in the North Yorkshire brewery's cooperage - which is one of the highlights of Theakston's visitor centre tour - and at fairs, festivals and shows all over the country.

The profession of cooper is said to require strength, intelligence and skill, with the finest barrels holding liquids

The last time Theakston's brewery advertised for a cooper position was 19 years ago in 1995 when Mr Manby, who has now become the cooper teacher ready to pass on his knowledge, was the successful applicant

Brewery director, Simon Theakston said: 'We are very proud to be one of the last breweries in the country to supply our ale in wooden casks and also to be preserving an ancient and skilled art.

'Tradition is respected not only in the brewing industry but in thousands of pubs throughout the country. We know consumers strongly approve of the idea of beer served from wood and we plan to continue that tradition.

Traditionally, a cooper is someone who makes wooden, staved containers with flat ends that are bound together with metal hoops.

Historically, this included casks, barrels, buckets and tubs, with the containers used for holding a range of items including milk, gunpowder, flour and tobacco.

The profession dates back to Roman times and was considered one of the most important medieval trades, evidenced by the appropriation of the word 'cooper' as a surname into a number of different languages.

However, the prevalence of modern metal and plastic casks, as well as timber shortages, has seen the number of coopers in England drastically reduce in the past 50 or 60 years.

It is thought there are no master coopers left in England - a rank attained only when one has successfully trained an apprentice.

'We have been using wooden casks since the company was founded by my great, great grandfather 187 years ago.

'The last time we advertised for this position was in 1995, and Jonathan Manby was the successful applicant.

'Watching Jonathan at work is fascinating and he uses the same methods and tools to create casks that coopers have used for hundreds and hundreds of years.

'The growing popularity of our cask ales means that Jonathan now requires another pair of hands to help him in his important job. However, coopering is a skill that cannot be learned overnight, and the training period can take up to four years.

'It is hard work, but the lucky applicant will know they are in a unique position - that of being the country's only brewery-employed apprentice craft cooper.'
