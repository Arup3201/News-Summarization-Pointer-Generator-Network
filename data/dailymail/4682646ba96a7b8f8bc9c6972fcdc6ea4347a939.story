A woman has been stabbed to death in the street by her drug dealer fiance after telling him she didn't want to get married, police said.

Jessica Broussard, 26, who had also struggled with drugs, was close to getting her life back on track when she was stabbed multiple times by Noah Scott, 29, outside his parents' home in Metairie, Louisiana on Saturday as horrified neighbors watched.

After the brutal attack, Scott ran back to his parents' home. When police confronted him minutes later, they said he continued to brandish the knife at officers, who shot him dead.

Now Broussard's family is trying to come to terms with losing their beloved sister and daughter just as they were finally getting her back after four years of drug problems.

The petite 26-year-old had struggled with heroin and prescription drugs, but after an overdose and another health scare in 2013, she decided to get clean, The Times-Picayune reported.

She was hoping to return to her career as a dental assistant. She had previously worked in the field for six years until she developed her addition.

But despite her amazing progress, she was still going out with convicted drug dealer, Noah Scott. They had been dating on and off for around a year-and-a-half, her father said.

'She wanted to leave him,' Broussard's best friend, Cassandra Catalanotto, told The Times-Picayune. 'He was very controlling and crazy.'

Struggle: Broussard was just getting her life back on track after battling drug addiction for four years, her family said. Scott was a convicted drug dealer who friends described as controlling

Doubts: The couple got engaged on New Year's Eve but on Saturday before he stabbed her to death, Broussard told Scott that she no longer wanted to get married

Broussard's family were not fans of Scott, who had pleaded guilty in July to drug possession with the intent to distribute after authorities found him with half a pound of marijuana.

Catalanotto also said she believes Scott was abusing her friend, who sometimes had black eyes.

So when Scott proposed to her on New Year's Eve, she felt pressured into accepting, the Times-Picayune reported.

But when she returned home, she realized she couldn't go ahead with marrying him. She told him her decision on Saturday, family said, but they still agreed to watch the Saints game together that night.

After the game, witnesses saw her running from the house, yelling: 'He's trying to stab me! He's trying to stab me!' Col. John Fortunato, a sheriffâ€™s spokesman, told the New Orleans Advocate.

Neighbor Mindy Durr told Fox8: 'The girl 
was screaming, "he's stabbing me", and ended up on my front lawn and he 
was over her, continuing to stab her.'

Killed: Police went to his parents' home, where they say he brandished a knife at officers, who shot him

Durr took her two young
children and ran inside, explaining: 'We 
have no idea if he was around the corner, we just didn't know.'

In fact, Scott had run back to his parents' house, where he lived. No one else was home at the time of the attack.

Another witness said he saw Scott glaring at him through the window and told police officers he was armed.

Fortunato said that when deputies arrived at the house, Scott refused to drop the weapon and became aggressive towards officers.

'That's when they fired, but he was told repeatedly to put the knife down,' Fortunato said.

Scott was pronounced dead at the scene.
