Allen Daniel Hicks Sr was taken in by police in May 2012 after they spotted him veering on the road

A driver who had a stroke on the road died after being left untreated in a jail cell for 36 hours.

Allen Daniel Hicks Sr was taken in by police in May 2012 after they spotted him veering on the Interstate 275 in Tampa, Florida.

He is said to have been rambling incoherently and dragging his left leg as the policemen booked him into jail.

He lay on the floor of his cell for more than a day before being taken to Tampa General Hospital and diagnosed is an ischemic stroke.

The 51-year-old went into a coma and died months later, reported the Tampa Bay Times.

State officials are now opening a review into health contractors Armor Correctional Health Services Inc almost a year after his death.

Armor is responsible for managing prisoners health care in Hillsborough County Jail system.

The Department of health has refused to comment or confirm the investigation, but lawyers for Hick’s family say they have been contacted by a medical quality assurance investigator.

Armor spokeswoman Yeleny Suarez said the company had not been contacted by the Department of Health, but the Sherriff’s office had been in touch. They add that they: ‘will cooperate fully with ongoing investigations.’

Armor cares for prisoners at 13 country jails and four Department of Corrections in the state.

They are also involved in prison management of four other states. They earn $20million per year from Hillsborough alone. 

The officials left Mr Hicks on the floor of the jail cell without noticing he had had a stroke

Thea Clark, deputy chief legal counsel for the Sheriff's Office, said that jail officials have provided all of their records to the state.

This includes jail surveillance video and internal memos that were critical of Armor.

Clark sent an internal memo earlier this year stating that a Tampa General Hospital neurosurgeon who treated Hicks ‘was extremely critical of the medical care provided by Armor’ to Hicks during his stay at the Orient Road and Falkenburg Road jails.

Hicks' heirs were paid $200,000 in a wrongful-death settlement by the Sherriff’s Office, in addition to $800,000 paid by Armor

An internal review cites at least ten nurses who were involved in the care of Allen Hick.

The Department of Health can take action to suspend or revoke the medical licenses of individuals, but does not have power to regulate many businesses and institutions.
