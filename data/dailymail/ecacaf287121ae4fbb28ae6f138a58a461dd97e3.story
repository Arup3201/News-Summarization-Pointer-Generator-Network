A Portland, Oregon chemistry teacher has been arrested and charged with making methamphetamine in a case drawing comparisons to television's gritty drug saga Breaking Bad.

Alexander Rudine, 38, a community college instructor pursuing a doctorate in chemistry at Portland State University, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to felony charges that he possessed, delivered and manufactured methamphetamine near a school, according to court documents.

His neighborhood is nestled between two parks with an elementary school only 790 feet away, which is why he also has been charged with manufacturing meth near a school.

He is  a former chemistry teacher at Mount Hood Community College.

The real Walter White?: A Portland State University  chemistry student and former community college teacher, Alexander Rudine, is accused of possessing, manufacturing and delivering meth

Uncanny similarity: Alexander Rudine's story is being compared to that of Walter White on Breaking Bad,  a chemistry teacher who makes meth to support his family after learning he has cancer 

Look familiar?: If allegations are true, Rudine is a bit like Walter White who was a chemistry teacher who turned to making meth and selling it

In addition to finding methamphetamine and drug-using paraphernalia, police found 'notes on how to re-crystallize methamphetamine along with a hand-written scientific formula at the bottom of the page,' Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney Christopher Shull wrote in an affidavit. 

The saga has people drawing parallels on social media and in local news reports on Thursday to the television drama that chronicles the downward spiral of Walter White, a 50-something high school chemistry teacher in the throes of a mid-life crisis who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.

To leave a nest egg for his wife and two children, White uses his chemistry knowledge to make and sell methamphetamine, an addictive street drug also known as crystal meth.

Police searched Rudine's home on Tuesday after receiving a tip from a suspected drug-runner, Shull wrote in the affidavit, filed on Wednesday.

Rudine told a court that he had taken leave from his teaching job and doctorate program to enter drug treatment.

KPTV reports that Rudine was sitting on his porch when deputies approached him.

In his pocket he was carrying $1,510 in cash along with 16 grams of meth in his waistband.

Court documents show that 14 more grams of meth were discovered in the basement and Rudine admitted to police, without questioning, that they belonged to him.

Also arrested on the scene was Morgan Amanda Clingings, 39, on a felony outstanding warrant for burglary charges, reports Fox.

Drug history: Alexander Rudine has two convictions for manufacture and delivery of a controlled substance in 1997 and possession of a controlled substance in 1998

Seeking treatment: Rudine told police he left both school and work so that he could seek addiction treatment 

Popular teacher: Alexander Rudine was graded a 4.1/5 of Rate My Professor, a site dedicated to evaluating college professors and their teaching styles 

A third person was interviewed on the scene but released.

The investigation is ongoing and more charges are expected.

This isn't the first time Rudine has been arrested on drug charges.

Rudine has two convictions for manufacture and delivery of a controlled substance in 1997 and possession of a controlled substance in 1998.

He was arrested other times for similar drug charges but the cases were later dismissed.

A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for October 23.

According to Rudine's Rate My Professor profile online, he was a popular and 'energetic' teacher among students while employed at Mount Hood Community College. His numerical rating was a 4.1 out of 5.

'I took the 5 week Chem course. The amount of material covered in that short amount of time made it challenging. However, Alex was organized and expectations were clear. He stayed energetic and excited about the material even after hours of lecture. He was always very approachable and helpful. His study guides and practice exams helped, ' writes one student.

Another student criticized Rudine's lessons as 'not making any sense' but it's unclear as to whether Rudine was using drugs while teaching at the college.
