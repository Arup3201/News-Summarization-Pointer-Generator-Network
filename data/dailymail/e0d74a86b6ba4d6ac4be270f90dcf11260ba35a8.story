Dramatic footage of confiscated motorcycles and quad bikes has been released to warn drivers to be responsible on the roads. 

The Quad Squad was set up by West Yorkshire Police in July to crack down on the number of dangerous drivers.

In just two months the group has seized almost 80 quads and motorbikes which have all been crushed in a bid to deter motorists from driving irresponsibly.

Footage of dozens of motorbikes and quad bikes before they are destroyed has been released by the Quad Squad 

The squad -set up by Yorkshire Police to tackle dangerous driving - has already seized 77 bikes since July

Vehicles that aren't claimed by owners are taken to a dismantling site and sorted into categories two categories - salvage or scrap. 

Those that are to be destroyed are dropped in a large hydraulic compacting machine which reduces the bikes - worth thousands of pounds - to a square hunk of metal and plastic. 

Another machine chews up wiring looms to produce child-friendly plastic, while bikes that are salvaged are sold on. 

Plans to donate some bikes to charities which work with young people who ride off road legitimately are being discussed.  

PC David Hitchcocks, of the Bike Team, said: 'Hopefully, this video should serve as a warning to those who make their neighbours’ lives a misery with noise nuisance or put their own enjoyment before the safety of other road users.

Among the vehicles some were destroyed into cubes of metal and plastic while others are sold on 

Bikes that are going to be scrapped are placed in a hydraulic compacting machine which reduces them to cubes of metal. West Yorkshire Police bikes were not included in the destruction 

Bradford Police hopes the images of crushed bikes will deter young motorists from driving recklessly 

A spokesman for the squad said no matter how much the vehicle is worth, it will be destroyed unless claimed by its owner once seized 

'It doesn’t matter if your vehicle is worth £50 or £3,000 - it will still end up as a cube of scrap metal if it is suspected of being used irresponsibly.' 

Sergeant Jonathan Best, who leads the team based in Bradford, West Yorkshire, added: 'We will continue to tackle nuisance riders across the district, and we urge people to keep reporting incidents and any details of the bikes which are being used to the police.

'We will also continue to work closely with our partners and use all available legislation, to make sure that those committing offences are prosecuted and dealt with positively.'
