Measuring 40ft high and riddled with rats and flies, this is the scene that greets residents of one suburban road every single morning.

Made up of compacted rubbish, this mountain is laden with everything imaginable from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges to tyres, scrap metal, excrement, discarded nappies and plastic bottles.

It has blighted the lives of residents living in Cornwall Drive in Bromley, south-east London for nearly five years – and shows no sign of being moved, despite the fact it set on fire again this week for the umpteenth time.

Residents of Cornwall Drive in Bromley, south-east London have lived in the shadow of this mountain of rubbish for five years – and there's no sign of it being moved

Firefighters have been keeping constant watch at the 40ft high site as the 25,000 tonne of rubbish keeps self-igniting in the heat and continues to smoulder away

Steam can often be seen coming from the top of the rubbish mountain as fire from within smoulders away, creating a putrid stench of burning plastic for local residents

Alan Cowburn, 74, who has lived on the road for 50 years, is praying for a time when the rubbish tip is shifted – but in the meantime he is forced to live with the putrid stench of rotting litter, the foot-long rats which roam freely and the plague of flies.

On top of that, he is forced to watch it smoulder away constantly as it continues to self-ignite in the warm summer heat.

‘The fire brigade have been here all day and night and they could be here all weekend, it’s a top priority fire risk,’ he said.

In fact, since 2011, London Fire Brigade has sent more than 650 fire engines to more than two dozen separate fires on the site. This represents more than 2,250 working hours and more than £650,000 in fire-fighting resources.

‘It’s costing the taxpayer a lot of money,’ said Mr Cowburn.

‘It’s a hazard because it keeps catching alight and the fire service has to come out constantly to check on it.

‘The trouble is it keeps self-igniting in the heat and it just sits there smouldering away.’

The mountain of garbage has been a massive problem for Mr Cowburn and his neighbours since rubbish disposal company Waste4Fuel took over the site in 2011.

Since 2011, London Fire Brigade has sent more than 650 fire engines to more than two dozen separate fires on the site - at a cost of more than £650,000 in resources

Firefighters continue to stand watch at the site on a daily basis and repeatedly hose it down to ensure the smouldering rubbish tip doesn’t escalate into a full-blown fire

According to its website, the firm’s aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and it ‘specialises in the collection and correct disposal of waste that can be reprocessed for use in generating electricity.’

It charges people to dump rubbish at the site — day and night, which it sorts, treats and then sends on for disposal elsewhere.

However, residents say this doesn’t happen and instead, over the past couple of years, Waste4Fuel has just taken the money and let it stack up in a monstrous putrid mountain.

‘It’s an absolute nightmare’, said Mr Cowburn.

‘This used to be a quiet little cul-de-sac, lovely and green and a pleasure to live in but now there’s a nasty smell as soon as you open the front door, flies and rats.

‘We’re living here under terrible conditions. We’re stuck with this huge problem and nobody wants to take any notice or do anything about it.

‘We need someone to come and ship it all out, but no one seems to be stepping up to do the job.’

Mr Cowburn reckons it will cost £2million and require a fleet of lorries to shift the 25,000 tonne of rubbish.

However, an ongoing dispute between Waste4Fuel, the Environment Agency and the High Court means the rubbish is unlikely to be moved any time soon.

Firefighters and officers are required to visit the south-east London site three times a day for the foreseeable future to monitor the rubbish and carry out security checks

The rubbish has attracted rats to the area and is plagued by flies meaning residents cannot open their windows, relax in their gardens or keep their cars clean of dust

The location of a waste or recycling plant is the responsibility of the local authority, which in this case is Bromley Council.

But its size and scope is set out in the operating permit granted by the Environment Agency, which allows Waste4Fuel to use the site ‘as a waste transfer station processing general non-hazardous waste, from commercial operators with [a maximum] of 5,500 tonnes allowed at any time.’

Last November, the agency won a court order for Waste4Fuel to clear the site of combustible waste by the end of April.

But the firm said it could only afford to comply by generating more money — by allowing more waste to be brought on site — and applied to increase the amount of rubbish it handles from 75 to 200 tonnes a week. It ended up failing to comply with the order.

The Environment Agency then tried to seek contempt charges against the recycling company, former company director Bryan Hughes, new company director Shelley Hurst and site manager Jonathan Beckson.

The charges were in relation to Waste4Fuel not complying with an undertaking to install appropriate fire breaks and separate areas for new waste at the site.

However, earlier this month the High Court dismissed the case – a decision which the agency is now deciding whether to appeal.

An Environment Agency spokesman said: ‘We fully understand and share the frustration of local residents and are doing everything we can to deal with the problems that Waste4Fuel have created.

‘We’ve used a range of approaches to make Waste4Fuel clean up the site. The site operators have avoided their responsibilities over many months and failed to comply with notices and a mandatory court order to remove the waste by 1 May 2014.

‘Waste crime blights people's lives. We will not give up.’

The Court recognised that those responsible have broken the law, but decided not to send them to prison. We’ll read the judgment carefully before deciding whether to appeal against that decision.

‘Since the hearing we’ve already served a further enforcement notice to stop Waste4Fuel from bringing any further waste on to the site and this appears to be working.

‘We are also considering what further steps we can take to make the operators remove the waste.

‘It is the operator’s and then the landowner’s responsibility to clear up the site. It is not the responsibility of public bodies unless there is an immediate risk to the public.

‘Our environment officers are visiting the site regularly and we will continue that close scrutiny working in partnership with the Fire Service, Health and Safety Executive and Local Authority to work to find a solution.’

The new enforcement notice means that any person depositing waste at Waste4Fuel will be committing an offence and may face further action from the Environment Agency.

The Environment Agency has issued an enforcement notice to site owners Waste4Fuel to stop the firm dumping any more waste at the already overcrowded site

Earlier this month, the High Court dismissed a case against Waste4Fuel which had been brought by the Environment Agency which was seeking contempt charges

Failure to comply with the new enforcement notice will result in further regulatory action being taken and several conditions within the new enforcement notice need to be met before further waste can be accepted at the site.

Andrew Pearce, Environment Agency Area Manager for Kent and South London, said: ‘This enforcement notice is another step towards the Environment Agency bringing the Waste4Fuel site back into compliance.

‘The High Court Order we secured last year has not been complied with, and waste on site is slowly increasing.

‘We understand the frustration of local residents and are doing everything within our power to bring the site back into compliance as soon as possible.’

In the meantime, firefighters continue to stand watch at the site on a daily basis to ensure the smouldering tip doesn’t escalate to a full-blown landfill fire.

In addition, officers are required to visit three times a day for the foreseeable future to monitor the rubbish and make security checks.
