Betrayal of trust: Kenneth McCaskey pleaded guilty to a charge of house-breaking and theft at Edinburgh Sheriff Court

When Kenneth McCaskey started dating the boss’s daughter, he was welcomed into the family like one of their own.

But it yesterday emerged that the salesman had betrayed their trust by breaking into their home and stealing a safe containing £50,000.

A court heard that magazine publisher Jeremy Hitchen only realised the strong-box was missing when his three-storey townhouse was flooded. It may have been missing for as long as four months.

McCaskey, 26, who had worked for the company for three years, then tearfully confessed to Mr Hitchen’s 23-year-old daughter Lucy that he was responsible.

He said: ‘I’ve made my bed. I deserve to suffer for it.’

McCaskey then told her parents that he had given the safe to an unknown individual to open and that the person had taken about £30,000 from it.

McCaskey, who had worked for Mr Hitchen’s The Media Company Publications Ltd, yesterday wept in the dock of Edinburgh Sheriff Court.

The firm publishes Living Abroad Magazine and the Edinburgh Festival Magazine and organises the Foodie Festivals. It is based at the Hitchen family home in Royal Circus, Edinburgh.

Prosecutor Karen Rollo told the court that McCaskey enjoyed a good relationship with Mr Hitchen and his wife Sue, 55.

She said: 'During that time, he became involved in a relationship with their daughter Lucy.

‘Mr Hitchen based his business at his home and the accused worked for him there. Mr Hitchen’s practice was to keep money relating to the business in a safe in the house.

‘There was £50,000 which was kept in the safe. The safe was taken from the house.’

Miss Rollo also told the court that, on March 3 this year, McCaskey, of Edinburgh, contacted a colleague.

She said: ‘When the accused contacted him, he said he wanted to have a wee chat and informed him that he had robbed the bosses and stolen the safe.

‘The employee was under the belief that most of the money had been paid back and did not discuss it immediately with anyone.

‘Around about the same time, Mr Hitchen had a flood within his house and he discovered the safe was missing.

‘When the employee returned to work, he told Mr Hitchen about his conversation with the accused. The daughter of the family then contacted the accused and he admitted to stealing the safe.

‘He told her, “I’ve made my bed. I deserve to suffer for it”. He then contacted Mr and Mrs Hitchen and he confessed in full and admitted what had happened.

‘He gave an explanation that an individual who he had given the safe to open had taken most of the money – around £30,000.

‘He did say that he was sorry and that he wanted to pay it back.’

The theft took place some time between December 10, 2011, and March 5, 2012.

McCaskey pleaded guilty to a charge of house-breaking and theft before Sheriff Gordon Liddle yesterday.

Sheriff Liddle deferred sentence on McCaskey until November in order for the court to obtain reports about his character.

Yesterday, Mr Hitchen was spotted outside his three-floor sandstone home. He was dressed casually and walking his dogs in the street’s exclusive park.

At the family home, Mrs Hitchen gave no comment.
