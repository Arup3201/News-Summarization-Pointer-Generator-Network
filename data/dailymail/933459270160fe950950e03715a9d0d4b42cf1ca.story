The social media backlash to the NYPD's invitation for citizens to tweet pictures of its officers in action has spread to Los Angeles.

Southern Californians are posting photos and stories of police brutality to Twitter with the hashtag #myLAPD, just as New Yorkers began to do using #myNYPD on Tuesday.

Now the well-intentioned hashtag has become a transcontinental bashtag campaign as citizens angry at violent police tactics from New York to Los Angeles and points between.

Sperading: The bashtagging of the New York police department's attempt to get citizens to tweet photos of officers doing good has spread to Los Angeles, where people are tweeting images of LAPD officers' bad behavior with the hashtag #myLAPD

Occupy Wall Street pointed out the spreading trend, which began just hours after the NYPD asked Twitter users to share pleasant photos of NYPD officers using the tag #myNYPD

The #myNYPD was set up for followers to share photos of themselves with police officers that would be viewed as positive.

The LAPD did not repeat the ill planned PR tactic, but Angelenos quickly took a cue from the East Coast bashtaggers.

'#myLAPD wear more combat gear then a U.S soldier deployed in Afghanistan,' tweeted @JC_LomeliÂ  along with a shot of a group of LAPD officers in SWAT gear, with one taking aim at something off camera.

Spreading northward: This picture of a Chicago man who died after he was beaten by police was tweeted with the tag #myCPD

Twitter users in Oakland followed suit Wednesday

Another tweet simply tagged as #myLAPD from @jimmy2beers shows a police officer sitting atop a subdued black man and preparing to club him.

Chicagoans also quickly hopped on the brutality-bashing trend.

'#myCPD beats peaceful protesters, press and even random passersby if they dare challenge the masters,' tweeted @ChicagoRADicals

As did some citizens of Oakland:

'#myOPD likes to shoot unarmed protestors with "less-lethal weapons"' wrote @NadiaKayyali along with a group of photos of grossly injured protestors.

Within a few hours, the campaign had received 10,000 predominantly negative responses, many of which were photos of violent arrests.

The original: The NYPD solicited fans to tweet photos of officers doing good around the city. But the campaign quickly backfired

Critics took the opportunity to post damning pictures on the hastag #MyNYPD, taking aim at such issues as excessive force and the controversial 'stop and frisk' practices

Occupy Wall Street NYC's Twitter account posted many photos under the hashtag.

The result was a public relations disaster for the force.

A Police spokeswoman responded to the negative publicity shortly before 6:30 pm.

'The NYPD is creating new ways to communicate effectively with the community,' said Deputy Chief Kim Y. Royster.

'Twitter provides an open forum for an uncensored exchange and this is an open dialogue good for our city.'

In November, JPMorgan Chase suffered a similiar social media campaign fail.

The bank invited followers to ask questions and speak with Vice Chairman Jimmy Lee in a live Tweeting session.

What followed was a humilating series of heckling and hostility.

A follow-up Q and A with Lee was quickly cancelled.
