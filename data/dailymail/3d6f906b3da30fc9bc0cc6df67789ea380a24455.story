The mother of a disabled teenage boy said her son was 'embarrassed and mortified' after she was forced to drag him to the bathroom because there was no wheelchair on board.

Virgin Australia has apologised after the incident involving Heike Fabig's son Kai, who is now 14, on board VA 183 from Sydney to Nadi, Fiji on September 28. 

But a furious Ms Fabig said that was not good enough and is demanding a wheelchair on board every flight.

She said some staff on board the flight even suggested she change Kai's nappy in his seat - in front of other passengers. 

'It just beggars belief,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Don't these people have children? 

'I don't want a voucher, I don't want points, I want an aisle chair on every flight - specifically if there is a wheelchair user on board.'

Airlines often keep aisle wheelchairs on board for people with injuries or disabilities to transport themselves around the aircraft.  

On a flight from Sydney to Fiji, Ms Fabig was forced to drag her son to the bathroom due to Virgin Australia failing to include an aisle wheelchair on board the plane 

Ms Fabig said her family had contacted the airline in the weeks prior to the incident and an official had assured them an aisle chair would be made available for Kai

Ms Fabig said her family had contacted the airline in the weeks prior to the incident and an official had assured them an aisle chair would be made available for Kai. 

But two hours into the flight, a flight attendant informed her there wasn't one on board. 

Kai has hereditary spastic paraplegia and the rare disorder Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy.

He developed symptoms of the disorder in April 2014. It has left him incontinent and unable to walk.

After tense discussions, she eventually carried her 50kg son the short distance to the toilet. 

Despite  the airline offering an apology (left) to her and her son (right), a furious Ms Fabig said: 'I don't want a voucher, I don't want points, I want an aisle chair on every flight - specifically if there is a wheelchair user on board'

'I had to sort of carry-drag him along,' she said. 

'They're actually really good in getting you onto the plane (via wheelchair).

'Once you're there you can just pee your pants.'

She said a concerned flight attendant wrote up an incident report and assured her there would be an aisle wheelchair on the return flight. 

However, 'on the return flight, the same thing happened'.   

Virgin sent Ms Fabig's family an apologetic email and have pledged to investigate the incident.

The email said: 'I apologise on behalf of the Virgin Group of airlines for the stress and inconvenience caused to you and your son.

'As per our discussion we do take this matter very seriously.

'However, whilst we remain focused on obtaining an outcome, I'm unable to provide a specific date for resolution.'

A spokeswoman for Virgin Australia told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was currently being investigated and that 'the business is working hard to rectify the situation'.

'Virgin Australia has sincerely apologised to the guest for any inconvenience caused in this situation and we are in contact with the guest regarding this matter. The safety and comfort of our guests is our number one priority.' 

Ms Fabig is considering taking the matter to the Human Rights Commission.
