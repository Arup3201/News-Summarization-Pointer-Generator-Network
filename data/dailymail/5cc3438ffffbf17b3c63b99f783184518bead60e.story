A Ukrainian security spokesman said data from the recovered flight recorders shows Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed due to a massive, explosive loss of pressure after being punctured multiple times by shrapnel.

Andrei Lysenko said the plane suffered 'massive explosive decompression' after it was hit by fragments he said came from a missile.

The data recorders were sent to UK experts for examination.

In their campaign to take control over more territory from separatist forces, Ukraine's army has deployed a growing amount of heavy weaponry.

Rebels have also been able to secure large quantities of powerful weapons, much of which the United States and Ukraine maintain is being supplied by Russia.

Moscow denies the claims.

It comes as fighting stopped an international police team from
reaching the wreckage of MH17 for second day running, as pro-Russian rebels admit they have lost control of part of the crash site.

Halt: Pro-Russian militants block the road behind Dutch and Australian forensic teams as they make their way to the crash site of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17

Fear: Dutch and Australian forensic investigators turned back on their way to the MH17 crash site this morning after 'explosions' were heard in the area

A high-rise apartment block in the town was hit by at least
two rounds of artillery, according to reports and dozens of families living in the area fled.

The development comes as UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said the downing of flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine may constitute a 'war crime'.

The mandate of the police team is to secure the currently
rebel-controlled area so that comprehensive investigations can begin and any
remaining bodies can be recovered.

With government troops intensifying their push to claw back
more territory from pro-Russian separatist rebels, the death toll is mounting
steadily.

Today rebels admitted they had lost control of part of the crash site to pro-Kiev forces.

United Nations figures show more than 1,100 people have died in just
over four months of fighting.

Ukraine has accused rebels of tampering with evidence and
trying to cover up their alleged role in bringing the Malaysia Airlines plane
down with an anti-aircraft missile.

Separatist officials have staunchly denied responsibility
for shooting down the airliner and killing all 298 people on board.

News that investigators were unable to reach the crash site for a second day comes as the UN said it was considering whether to classify the downing of MH17 as a war crime.

Human rights chief Navi Pillay spoke out to say taking down to plane with a surface to air missile could constitute a war crime.

Destroyed: A man walks past a damaged house in Horlivka - about 30 miles from north west of the MH17 crash site. The Ukrainian army is hoping to regain control of the town, which is considered a separatist stronghold

Wrecked: A man stands in rubble of a damaged house in Horlivka. Separatist leader Alexander Boroday accused president Petro Poroshenko of starting a new military offensive to hide the truth about MH17

Deadly: Smoke is seen rising over rebel-held Donetsk overnight. Today alone, at least eight civilians were killed by fighting and shelling in rebel-held cities in eastern Ukraine - three of them in Donetsk

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a report that at least 1,129 people have been killed between mid-April, when fighting began, and July 26.

The report said at least 3,442 people had been wounded and more than 100,000 people had left their homes. A UN report from mid-June put the death toll at 356.

overnight, officials in the region said today

 in Luhansk said that five people were killed and 15 injured by 
overnight artillery strikes. Three were killed in Donetsk as a result of
 clashes.

Rebel leader Alexander Boroday accused Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko of starting a new military offensive to hide the truth about the downing of MH17.

Intensified combat operations 'are irrefutable evidence proving that Kiev is seeking to destroy all evidence of the crime committed by its military,' he alleged.

'The junta is in panic, the only thing that matters for them today is to evade exposure.

'Kiev's actions run counter to Poroshenko's decision to declare a 40-kilometre zone around the crash site a ceasefire territory.'

Ukrainian military analyst Dmitry Tymchuk today alleged that rebels were sneaking back dressed as civilians into areas 'liberated' by the Ukrainian army.Â 

'The activity of the enemy's sabotage groups is high,' he said.
