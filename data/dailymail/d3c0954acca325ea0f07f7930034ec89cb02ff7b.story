A mother has broken her silence and revealed her heartbreak about her daughter's 'horrific' death at the hands of a 'friend' she had taken pity on.

Kailee Clapp's still-burning body was dumped in a cemetery by Stathis Kirkpatrick in January 2011. The 14-year-old was so badly charred she had to be identified by her dental records. 

He had lured her to her death by promising her a present – then stabbed her and set her alight while she was still alive.

Kirkpatrick was sentenced to life in prison in December 2012.

He refused to explain why he killed Kailee – but gave his family the thumbs up as he was jailed. 

Now Kailee's mother Nora Clapp, 51, of McCook, Nebraska, has spoken out about her heartbreak.

'The truth about what had happened to Kailee was horrific. It turned out Stathis began texting her just after 3am on the night she disappeared in January 2011,' she said.

'He told my daughter he had a belated Christmas present for her, and lured her from her bed.

'One of Kailee's last text messages to him was to say she'd meet him at the top of the alley by our house.

'There Stathis attacked her, stabbing her cheek and chin. He bundled her battered body into his car and drove her to the cemetery.

'While she was still breathing, he doused her in petrol and set her on fire. Kailee was so charred she had to be identified from her dental records.'

On September 6, 2012, Kirkpatrick, then 20, of McCook, Nebraska, appeared in Red Willow County District Court and pleaded 'no contest' to first degree murder.

The court was told Kailee had initially been badly mutilated. Afterwards – while still alive – she had had petrol poured on her and was then set alight. 

Mrs Clapp said she believed Kirkpatrick targeted her daughter because he fancied her and she was not interested. 

'Imagining what she went through and how scared she must have been, was just unbearable,' she said. 

'I still don't understand how anyone could be so evil. But I think Stathis was bitter Kailee had rejected him and murdered her out of spite.

'I wish she had never gone to meet him that night. But she was so friendly she probably didn't have the heart to tell him to go away. He took advantage of my girl's kindness to kill her.'

Mrs Clapp told how Kailee had initially met Kirkpatrick when he was 18 and they attended the same school. He had moved to Nebraska from New Mexico.

'Kailee said he'd moved in with his aunt because he's been struggling to get along with his family in New Mexico,' she said.

'She told me, 'he hasn't had the best start in life, but he's a great person'.

'It was typical of her to see the good in everyone.

'But they were only friends. Kailee was dating another boy who she went to school with and who was lovely.'

One Thursday evening, in January 2011, Kailee was watching television with her mother and sister Karen, now 17, when she went to bed around 10pm.

Her mother checked on her later and she was asleep. It was the last time she saw her daughter.

'Karen said she wasn't in bed,' Mrs Clapp said. 'I called her mobile but it was switched off.

'I was frantic and called the police. They immediately searched for her. But the hours ticked by and there was no news.

'I went to Kailee's school and began questioning the kids in her class. No-one seemed to have a clue.

'While I was walking home, I was passing an alleyway near our house when I froze – I noticed blood stains on the ground and I instinctively knew it was Kailee's blood.'

'I felt sick with dread as I phoned the police.'

Mrs Clapp said she told police: 'It's Kailee's blood.'

But it was hours before they had news.

Kailee's body had been found in a cemetery 20 miles from her home, mutilated and torched.

'Police told me they'd arrested Stathis in connection with Kailee's disappearance.

'I was so confused. I didn't know what he had to do with her disappearance.

'The next few months were torture. The police couldn't tell us why Stathis was suspected of murdering Kailee.

Mrs Clapp, pictured center, said the family remember Kailee, left, everyday, but added: 'Our family will never be the same again'

'Some of her friends had a theory about why he might have done it. They told me Stathis had a crush on Kailee but she told him he wasn't interested.'

Mrs Clapp said she remembers Kailee every day, but added: 'Our family will never be the same again.'

She said: 'We think about Kailee every day and talk about constantly.

'Last summer, Karen graduated from high school. In her speech, she told her classmates about her little sister.

''She was my best friend. She'll always be with me.' 

'Now, every year on the anniversary of Kailee's death, we hold a candlelit vigil for her in the park.

'Kailee's death has left an empty hole in my heart. But I'm determined to keep her memory alive.'
