Wealthy Conservative donors are defecting to the UK Independence Party to pledge financial backing ahead of next month’s local elections, it emerged today.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested five or six former members of the Tory Leader’s Group who paid £50,000-a-year to dine with David Cameron and other frontbenchers had switched to support his anti-EU party.

One ex-donor said he decided to switch after a dinner with Mr Cameron where he just wanted to talk about contestants on X-Factor.

next year’s elections to the European Parliament.

Mr Farage is trying to build momentum from his party’s success in pushing the Tories into third place in the Eastleigh by-election in February.

He has embarked on a nationwide Commons Sense tour of town hall meetings to engage disaffected voters.

The party is fielding record numbers of candidates in May’s local elections, and hopes to more than double its share of the vote from the five per cent it won in 2009.  A UKIP insider said: ‘I would be disappointed if we are not on 13 per cent.’

UKIP treasurer Stuart Wheeler, who gave £5.5million to the Tories before being expelled from the party three years ago, said around 30 councillors had defected from other parties this year. Around 20 were Conservatives.

Last year he suggested that up to eight Tory MPs were in talks about defecting to UKIP, but that threat appears to have receded.

Asked if he thought it possible before the 2015 general election, he said: ‘I think it is slightly more likely than not, but one has to remember that an MP who defects is more likely to lose his seat at the next election.’

But he insisted former financial backers of the Tory party were coming across. ‘Some of [our new donors] were Conservatives but many are unwilling to go public.

‘Any donation of more than £7,500 has to go on the electoral commission website. Quite a few give us exactly £7,500 because they don't want [their identities] to be known,’ he told The Guardian.

‘There is one potential donor who said he will give us £1m provided one or two other people do as well for the 2014 elections. The person concerned has been a big Conservative donor. People don't always do what they say they are going to do but we think he will.’

Adrian Buckley, a former member of the Tory Leaders Club, said he had switched to UKIP after becoming disillusioned with Mr Cameron. He has given £6,000 to UKIP and plans to give more.

‘I recall having supper with him one evening in 2010 at the home of a hedge-fund manager ... in spite of many serious questions from around the table the most illuminating insight we were able to secure was that he favoured Wagner to win The X Factor,’ Mr Buckley told The Times.

He went on: ‘I was attracted to UKIP because Nigel Farage clearly outlined his desire for a much smaller State involvement in our lives and an immediate withdrawal from Europe.’

Other former Tory donors who have defected to UKIP include children’s author Graham Taylor and Andrew Charalambous, a former Conservative candidate.
