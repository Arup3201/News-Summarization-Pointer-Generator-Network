The Mormon faith of presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been one of the hot topics throughout the Republican's campaign.

But a recent photo posted on social network website Twitter took speculation about the strength of his religious beliefs to new heights.

It shows the GOP nominee wearing an unbuttoned white shirt with his Mormon underwear clearly visible underneath.

Temple garment: This recent Twitter photo shows Mitt Romney wearing an unbuttoned white shirt with his Mormon underwear clearly visible underneath

Also known as a 
Temple garment, it typically covers the shoulders and extends to the 
knees, in deference to rules surrounding the Church of the Latter Day 
Saints' temples.

The close-fitting and far-from-revealing underwear is not a requirement for Mormons.

But the bulky cotton T-shirt and long shorts need to be hidden beneath clothes, even during the summer months.

It is strictly not for public display.

Those worshippers that do wear a Temple garment must keep it on day and night. It must also be worn when entering a temple, hence its name.

The image showing Mr Romney wearing the underwear ties in with his campaign tales of life as a Mormon missionary in France in the 1960s.

He has revealed, with little detail spared, how he defecated into a bucket while serving.

Mr Romney said he spent 
two-and-a-half years knocking on doors as he was greeted by locals with 
guns, or their barking dogs chasing at his heels.

These claims of a hard life since have been disputed by other missionaries.

What is clear is that Mr Romney’s 
mission to France took him through Le Havre, Paris and Bordeaux, 
promoting a church which now has 14million members globally.

The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-Day Saints now has 36,000 members in France and many of them 
found the faith thanks to missionaries.

Missionary work is a central tenet of Mormonism that is required of 
members and 52,000 missionaries currently serve in 350 missions 
globally.

On the up: Mr Romney won 39 per cent of the vote in Maine, three points ahead of the maverick libertarian Ron Paul

Mr Romney enjoyed another surge in the Republican candidacy race at the weekend.

He won both the Maine caucuses and a poll of conservative activists gathered in Washington - a double boost that could help steady his White House campaign after last week’s shock defeats.

The former Massachusetts governor won 39 per cent of the vote in Maine, three points ahead of the maverick libertarian Ron Paul.

Rick Santorum, who swept the board in Missouri, Colorado and Minnesota last Tuesday secured 18 per cent with Newt Gingrich languishing in fourth on just 6 per cent.

In a straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, Mr Romney won 38 per cent of the 3,408 votes cast, ahead of Mr Santorum on 31 per cent, Mr Gingrich on 15 and Dr Paul on 12.

Dr Paul had made a major play for Maine in the hope of chalking up his first victory of the 2012 campaign.

Mr Romney’s victory will help change the narrative that he is in major trouble and could help arrest Mr Santorum’s surprise surge.
