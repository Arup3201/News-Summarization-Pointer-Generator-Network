The antique dealer jokes that his photo is proof Nicolas Cage is more than just an a-list actor - he’s also a vampire who lived during the American Civil War.

An eBay seller claims to have a 4” by 2.5” carte de visite photo from around 1870 of a man who looks exactly like the 47-year-old star of Con Air, Ghost Rider and The Rock.

The seller, who has put the starting price at $1million, says the photo is 100 per cent genuine and was taken of a man who lived in Bristol, Tennessee, around the time of the Civil War.

Lookalike: An eBay seller claims to have a 4” by 2.5” carte de visite photo, right, from around 1870 of a man who looks exactly like the 47-year-old star of Con Air, Ghost Rider and The Rock, Nicolas Cage, left in 2006

The man who put the photo on eBay is Jack Mörd, of Seattle, Washington, whose Facebook page says he is originally from Los Angeles, California, and owns ‘The Thanatos Archive’.

'My theory is that he allows himself to age to a certain point, maybe 70, 80 or so, then the actor “Nicolas Cage” will “die”,’ Mr Mörd joked.

‘But in reality, the undead vampire “Nicolas Cage” will have rejuvenated himself and appeared in some other part of the world, young again, and ready to start all over.’

The photo comparison may suggest Nicolas Cage could have lived forever.

But the actor's radically-changing 
appearance over the years suggests he's as vulnerable to the ravages of 
time as the rest of us.

The 47-year-old Californian has clearly aged since his appearances in Con Air in 1997, top right, and then Adaptation in 2002, right.

Mr Cage's wife Alice Kim is around 
half his age at 27.

But hair 
transplants have seemingly helped maintain a youthful look.

The picture was found in the back of an 
album that contained many unusual death portraits from the Civil War era
 - but the Nicolas Cage lookalike was not identified by name, Mr Mörd 
said.

He has a 100 per cent positive feedback 
rating on eBay and his profile says he is interested in collecting and 
selling Victorian Era post-mortem photography, as well as other vintage 
pictures.

The eBay product description for ‘Nicolas Cage is a Vampire / Photo from 1870 / Tennessee’ says: ‘Original c.1870 carte de visit showing a man who looks exactly like Nick Cage.

‘This is not a trick photo of any kind and has not been manipulated in Photoshop or any other graphics program.

'It's an original photo of a man who lived in Bristol, TN, sometime around the Civil War.'

It is believed the photo was taken by a confederate Civil War prisoner of war photographer called Professor G.B. Smith.

Mr Mörd joked that Nicolas Cage could be a walking undead man who reinvents himself once every 75 years - and might be looking at going into politics or talk show hosting next.
