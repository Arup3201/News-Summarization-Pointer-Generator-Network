Jenson Button has issued an emphatic response to boss Ron Dennis’s 
criticism by calling on the entire McLaren team to raise their game in a
 bid to curve the constructor’s downward spiral.

Dennis took aim at 
Button last weekend after ordering the Englishman, who will compete in 
his 15th British Grand Prix on Sunday, to improve on his performances 
after seeing McLaren slump to sixth in the championship. 

But Button, seemingly irked by his boss’s comments, fought back in bullish fashion on the eve of his home race.

‘I think everyone has to try harder, the whole team, we all need to try harder,’ said Button.

‘If
 we want to get back to the front, if we want to win races, then we have
 got to try harder. We are doing an OK job right now. We are working 
hard, but to get back to the front, from the management down, we all 
have to try harder and get the best out of ourselves so that is 
hopefully what every one is doing and I definitely am.’

Dennis 
believed that the form of Button’s rookie team-mate Kevin Magnussen, who
 has fewer points than the 34-year-old in the championship, but has 
achieved the team’s best result of the season after he finished second 
at the curtain raiser in Melbourne in March, should provide a ‘big 
wake-up call’.

‘In some ways you say, “great, we’ve made a great 
choice with Kevin”, but in other ways you say, “Come on Jenson, you are a
 World Champion and one thing you can do on a consistent basis - and you
 should be doing it - is beating your team-mate,’ Dennis, who 
has returned to McLaren’s Formula One operation after a five-year 
absence this season, said. ‘Do I want him to try harder? Of course I do -
 he’s a highly-paid grand prix driver.’

Fighting talk: Button has urged McLaren to perform better this weekend

‘For me, the important thing
 is I have true belief in myself and I am giving it my all,’ Button 
remarked when it was put to the 2009 World Champion if he adjudged the 
criticism to be unfair. 

‘Believing in yourself and believing in the
 team, that is the most important thing. When I come out of a tough 
weekend with the team, I sit down with them, we discuss what happened, 
we more forward and we try and find a way out of it and try and improve 
ourselves and that is they way we are going to win races. That is the way we are going to win races; all working as one to get 
better.’

After Andy Murray crashed out of Wimbledon on Wednesday, 
England’s torrid World Cup campaign in Brazil, and the England rugby 
team’s miserable white-washing in New Zealand, does Button, out of 
contract at McLaren at the end of this season, feel a sense of added 
pressure on himself and countryman Lewis Hamilton with 120,000 expectant
 British fans descending on Silverstone this weekend?

‘I put enough 
pressure on myself and I feel that Lewis does as well,’ Button answered.
 ‘Lewis has got a good chance of winning. I want to be the guy that wins
 this weekend, but realistically that is not going to happen. There is 
always a miracle that could happen but Lewis has a really good chance. 

‘Being
 British I really hope he does. It will be amazing for the British 
public and the British fans, and the atmosphere at Silverstone, so it 
would be very special. I will give him that one,’ he adds with a smile. 

Deep in thought: The upcoming race at Silverstone will be Button's first British Grand Prix since his father John passed away
