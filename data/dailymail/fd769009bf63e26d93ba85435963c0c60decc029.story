Grumpy and miserable people in the workplace are more productive, according to a new study

He or she may not be the most popular person in the workplace, but your grumpy colleague may just be the person to turn to when a task needs completing.

Researchers say workers described as ‘haters’ are more focused because they spend a lot of time on fewer activities. It means they are good at their job because they hone their skills in specific tasks.

However, those seen as the life and soul of the workplace – ‘likers’ – spread themselves more thinly, possibly making them less productive employees.

The findings, from researchers at the Universities of Illinois and Pennsylvania and published in the journal Social Psychology, may have implications for understanding the development of expertise.

Participants in the study reported their activities over a week and also completed a measure of ‘dispositional attitudes’ – how they reacted to various situations.

Although haters and likers did not differ in the types of activities they pursued, the former tended to do fewer. Likers may have difficulty sustaining attention on a task because they perceive so many interesting opportunities in their environment.

To prove their point, in two studies participants reported all their activities over a week and also completed a measure of dispositional attitudes.

Although haters and likers did not differ in the types of activities they pursued, the former tended to do fewer throughout the period.

Almost 15 percent of the differences in how many activities people conducted was associated with their personality.

Haters and likers also did not differ in how much time they spent on them, just the number they managed. As a result, haters spent more time on any given activity.

So, compared with likers, haters would be characterised as less active because they do fewer things, or as more focused because they spend more time on the small number of things they do.

Dr Hepler said: “The present results demonstrate that patterns of general action may occur for reasons other than the desire to be active versus inactive.

'Indeed, some people may be more active than others not because they want to be active per se, but because they identify a large number of specific behaviours in which they want to engage.'

They added likers may have more difficulty sustaining attention on a task because they perceive so many interesting and distracting opportunities in their environment.

In contrast, because haters like so few things, they may be unlikely to be distracted when they are doing a task, and thus their generalized dislike may actually benefit their attention
