Tottenham can be revealed as the team who play least often during the Saturday 3pm slot traditionally reserved for English league football matches.

Spurs have kicked-off at that time in just seven out of 51 Premier League games played since the start of the 2013-14 season, whereas Stoke have played at that time on 31 occasions, the most of any top-flight team.

Tottenham fans have also seen their team play just 14 of those games at any time on a Saturday - again the lowest number in the Premier League. The club's involvement in the Europa League, which is played on Thursday nights, can explain much of their absence from the Saturday fixture list as clubs require three days' rest following European fixtures.

Stoke were beaten by Liverpool at Anfield in their most recent fixture, which kicked-off at 3pm on Saturday 

Sportsmail has investigated the kick-off times for each of the teams who have been in the top flight since the start of last season. The results are detailed in the tables below, where you can see on which days your club has played.

West Ham are the side who have played most often on a Saturday, the day which was once reserved for the nation to watch their favourite team play. 

Live broadcasting of Premier League games has gradually eroded the number of matches which kick off at 3pm on Saturdays.

Unsurprisingly it is the less fashionable teams which get closest to Stoke's number of 31 kick-offs at that time. Crystal Palace, Hull City and Southampton (all 30) and West Brom (29) have the next highest totals.

Of the established 'big four' clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United - it is Jose Mourinho's team which has played in the traditional slot the most with 13, while the Reds played just nine games at that time. 

Liverpool and champions Manchester City top the list of teams who have played in the early kick-off on Saturday at 12.45pm, with eight apiece. Chelsea are the team who most often played in the late 5.30pm kick-off, with nine.
