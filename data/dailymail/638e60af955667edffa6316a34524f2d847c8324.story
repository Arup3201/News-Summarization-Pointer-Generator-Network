An elderly from Utah has been ordered to serve at least 15 years in prison for the murder of his wife in 2011.

Charles Edward Dodd, 78, pleaded guilty, but mentally ill, to one count of murder.

Dodd admitted to stabbing his 10th wife, Mary W. Ratliffe, three times in the heart in August 2011.

After killing her, he took a large amount of prescription drugs and drank a tumbler of vodka before stabbing himself in the chest and losing consciousness.

Investigators learned of Ratliffe's death and Dodd's suicide attempt after an acquaintance notified them that Dodd had left two envelopes at her office containing $7,000 in cash and two notes indicating that he intended to kill his wife and himself.

'In the note he wrote he said he didn't want Mary taken from him,' Ratliffe's daughter, Connie Pearson told KSL news. She described him 'anxious and worried about every little thing' in the months before the murder.

The killing happened before the couple were dues to move to Houston.

They were a couple for 20 years and had been married for 10.

Both had health problems, according to Pearson. He suffered from a condition that left his lips blue from a lack of oxygen.

She
 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Despite her medical 
condition, Pearson said her mother was healthy and active. She dismissed
 Dodd's claims to detectives that her mother was an invalid who wanted 
to die.

This wasn't a mercy killing. This was murder,' she said.

Issues over Dodd's competency to stand trial led to several delays in the case.

It was no mercy killing: Mary W. Ratliffe's daughter has been critical of the way the case was handled by the Duchesne County Attorney's Office. Her primary complaints center on the length of time it took to reach a resolution in the case and a lack of communication from prosecutors

He was committed to the Utah State Hospital for at least a year and underwent three separate psychological examinations.

When Dodd woke up in his hospital bed shortly after the murder, he said he wanted to 'plead guilty to the charge straight up, be sent to the (state prison) and have them put a bullet in his head,' defense attorney Bill Morrison said.

As a result of that statement, the medical examiner found Dodd incompetent to stand trial.

Pearson said she had hoped that Dodd would have been eligible for the death penalty.

However, given his age though and the 15-to-life sentence he received, she said that he will likely die behind bars.

'I'm still going through the various levels of grief,' Pearson said. 'Right now, I can't forgive him. (My mother) was an inspiration to me.'

Dodd will begin serving his sentence at the state hospital before being moved to the state prison.
