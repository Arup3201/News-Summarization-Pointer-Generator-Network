Open verdict: Private Cheryl James, 18, was found dead with a single bullet would to the head outside the Surrey barracks in 1995

Relatives of a young Army recruit found dead at Deepcut Barracks today FRI demanded a fresh inquest after forcing police to disclose dozens of secret files.

The family of 18-year-old Cheryl James, represented by human rights campaign group Liberty, lodged an application with the Attorney General for permission to fight for a new hearing.

The move by Pte James' parents, Des and Doreen James, is the latest step in their 18-year battle for justice.

The teenage recruit was found dead from a single bullet wound to her head outside the notorious base in Surrey in November 1995.

An inquest held a month after her death recorded an open verdict.

She was one of four young soldiers who died in mysterious circumstances at the barracks in Surrey between 1995 and 2002, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse.

Private Geoff Gray, 17, Private Sean Benton, 20, and Private James Collinson, 17, also died from gunshot wounds.

The families have refused to accept the theory that all four soldiers committed suicide using their own rifles and have accused the Army of a cover-up.

Concerns about the string of tragedies led Surrey Police to open an investigation in 2002.

Officers took hundreds of statements and instructed forensic experts but concluded there was no evidence anyone else was involved in the shootings.

Controversially, Surrey Police flatly refused to give Mr and Mrs James, from Llangollen, North Wales, access to the files.

Now the force has caved in and handed over 44 volumes of files â€“ including witness statements, documents, notes and photographs - after Liberty threatened them with legal action under the Human Rights Act.

Some 70 per cent of the papers have never been seen before by Pte James' family.

Liberty said the material includes forensic tests that have never been properly examined and evidence some witnesses lied - including one on oath at the inquest.

The pressure group has applied for a fresh inquest into Pte James' death and will soon be doing the same on behalf of the parents of Pte Benton.

If Attorney General Dominic Grieve gives his consent, the family will take the fight to the High Court in a bid to secure a fresh inquest.

In a statement, Mr and Mrs James said: 'We're disappointed it has taken close to 18 years for us to even get disclosure of the evidence related to Cheryl's premature death.

Dead: James Collinson, 17, from Perth, found with a single gunshot wound in March 2002

Dead: Geoff Gray, 17, from Seaham, took two bullets to his head in September 2001

'No family should ever have to go through what we've experienced, and the fact there still has never been any meaningful inquiry into the four deaths at Deepcut remains a stain on the integrity of everyone involved.

'All four were placed in the care of the state and all four were badly let down.

'The implications of the new evidence is both serious and extremely worrying.'

Liberty's legal officer Emma Norton said: 'Cheryl's grieving family have been consistently snubbed by the state in their quest to discover what really happened to their daughter - only a fresh inquest can deliver the truth they so deserve.

'The human rights of our troops are worthy of exactly the same protection as everyone else - until what happened to these young people at Deepcut is competently, calmly and independently investigated, justice will not be done.'

A spokesman for the Attorney General's office confirmed that it had received an application from Liberty.
