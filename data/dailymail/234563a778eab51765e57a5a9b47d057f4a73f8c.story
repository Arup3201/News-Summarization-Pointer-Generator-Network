He may have climbed Mount Snowdon dozens of times, but mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington only carried the Olympic torch a short distance to the summit today, after the famous flame travelled the rest of the journey up Wales' highest mountain on a train. 

Crowds cheered as Sir Chris, 77, smiled broadly and held up the golden torch in jubilation on day 11 of the Olympic relay route.

The flame travelled in a miner's lantern on the Snowdon Mountain Railway and was carried by up stone steps by Sir Chris to the top and lit, 1,085 metres above sea level.

Excitement: Before receiving the torch, he tweeted: 'About to board train to Snowdon summit to carry Olympic torch on top. 1st time I've been there by train. Glorious day!!!!'

It was a significant moment for the mountaineer who began his climbing career on the mountain, in Gwynedd, north Wales, 61 years ago.

An emotional Sir Chris, who has also climbed Mount Everest and the Eiger and was knighted in 1996 for his services to mountaineering, said taking part in the relay was 'a special moment.'

'The honour of carrying this torch, and joining other torchbearers around the United Kingdom, the whole thing is wonderful,' he said afterwards.

Before receiving the torch, he tweeted: 'About to board train to Snowdon summit to carry Olympic torch on top. 1st time I've been there by train. Glorious day!!!!'

The relay's 11th day had started earlier on Anglesey as a convoy of four RNLI lifeboats helped carry the flame up the water which separates the island from mainland Wales.

Racing against the stopwatch to get from their boathouse to the pier at Menai bridge in 15 minutes, the crews managed to make it to the finishing line on time.

They were escorted from the air by an RAF Sea King rescue helicopter and an RAF Hawk jet.

Speaking after the torch had been successfully dropped off at the bridge, deputy division inspector for the RNLI in Wales and the Isle of Man, Matt Crofts said it had been a 'prestigious honour' to transport the torch.

The 39-year-old said: 'Our volunteers here have worked tirelessly, they have put hours into this, we have done two rehearsals to make sure everything went right.

'Those rehearsals paid off today because everything went flawlessly for us.

'It was a really good showcase of the work the RNLI does on the beaches and off shore.'

Boats formed a flotilla which followed the torch along the waterway flying Union Jack and Welsh flags.

Meanwhile, crowds enjoyed the warm early morning weather from the shore.

The torchbearer carrying the flame aboard an Atlantic 85 B-class lifeboat was local rugby player Elen Evans.

An international for Wales, Evans was the first woman to score a try at Cardiff's Millennium stadium.

Riding with her in the convoy as a helmsman was volunteer Antony Robinson.

He described how different it was to the work he usually carries out as a lifeboat volunteer, saying: 'I think it was the fact that we had time to think about it.

'The more you think about it the more you get pressurised into thinking about what if this happens, what if that happens, what if the weather...

'When the pagers go off you have minutes, seconds, you don't really have time to think.'

After reaching the mountain's summit, the flame then crossed from the Happy Valley to the Great Orme summit on the Great Orme Cable Car.

Also carrying the flame will be gymnast Beth Tweddle and jockey Jason Maguire, who will ride the final leg in Chester, scheduled to arrive at 17:47.

By that point the flame  will have been passed on by 125 torchbearers and traveled 79 miles today.

Olympic torch route: The flame will cover 8,000 miles in just 70 days and will be held by 8,000 torchbearers
