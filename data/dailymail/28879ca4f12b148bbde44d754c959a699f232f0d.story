It was 23 degrees (19 with wind chill) and blowing snow with near whiteout conditions. A perfect time to ...go surfing?

Two daring surfers hit the waves of Lake Erie outside Buffalo on Tuesday in the midst of one of the city's nastiest snow storms, which dumped up to five feet of snow in a matter of hours. 

Christian Edie and her fiance Kevin Cullen filmed their brave stunt - though it was so cold outside that they had to stop rolling several times to clear the ice off the camera.

Nice weather for a swim: Christian Edie trudged through snow on her way to go surfing in Lake Erie on Tuesday in the middle of a blizzard

Ms Edie caught a wave on Lake Erie headed into the snowy shore. Her fiance Kevin Cullen filmed 

Ms Edie and Mr Cullen wore dry suits, which helped keep the water away from their skin and allowed them to survive in the frigid conditions. 

Oddly enough, the water was actually dramatically much warmer than the air outside. 

Temperatures stayed below freezing for most of the day, but Lake Erie was a comparatively toasty 45 degrees. 

Ms Edie and Mr Cullen are surfing enthusiasts from chilly western New York, which means they've probably more accustomed to cold water than most surfers.

Daring duo: Kevin Cullen and Christian Edie are Buffalo natives who love to surf - so it stands to reason they wouldn't be afraid of the cold

The couple used dry suits to protect themselves from the cold water - which was about 45 degrees

But the pair hit the beach while the rest of the region was holed up at home under emergency orders to stay inside.

Up to 150 drivers were stranded on the New York State Thruway. 

Lake Erie, where the two caught some waves, was largely responsible for the nasty storm.

Lake effect snow, caused by cold air passing over warmer water - like Lake Erie.
