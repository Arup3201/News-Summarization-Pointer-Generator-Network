Coronation Street star Andrew Lancel emerged from his house for the first time yesterday after he was charged with indecently assaulting a child.

The married actor, 42, who denies all five charges, looked grim faced as he emerged from his Liverpool home in a cap and glasses.

It is believed the alleged offences against him are believed to date back to when he was a trainee actor called Andrew Watkinson and relate to a child under 16.

Denials: Andrew Lancel has strenuously denied the five indecent assault charges

Speaking to The Sun on Saturday, his lawyer said Mr Lancel 'strenuously denies the allegations'.

Solicitor Stuart Nolan said: 'Mr Lancel was invited by police to co-operate with an inquiry by one complainant about events that allegedly took place over 20 years ago.

'He is confident his innocence will be established in the fullness of time.'

Facing charges: Lancel has been bailed to appear at South Sefton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, 19 December

He tweeted on Saturday: 'My lovely followers and friends. Your support means the world. Have faith. Good night. See you soon x.'

Lancel's Coronation Street character Frank was killed off in March. He joined the famous soap after being in The Bill as Detective Inspector Neil Manson.

Actor: Lancel is pictured as Frank Foster in Coronation Street with actress Alison King

Support: The actor is currently starring in the play Epstein: The Man Who Made The Beatles in Liverpool. Last night he tweeted this to his followers

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Merseyside Police can confirm that a 42-year-old man has been charged with five offences of indecent assault on a child under 16 under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

'Andrew Watkinson, 42, was charged with the offences today (Friday, 30 November).

'The offences are historic. He has been bailed to appear at South Sefton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, 19 December.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
