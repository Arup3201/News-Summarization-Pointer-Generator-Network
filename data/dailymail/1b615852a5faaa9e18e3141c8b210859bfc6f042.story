Less than two months after coming out, NBA veteran Jason Collins happily showed off his true colors and marched with thousands in Boston's gay pride parade.

Wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with with a rainbow hashtag '#BeTrue', Collins walked alongside his onetime roommate at Stanford University, Congressman Joe Kennedy III, according to the Associated Press.

Collins said he started thinking about coming out when Kennedy marched in last year's parade and Collins didn't think he could walk with his friend.

He said that the Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three and injured hundreds, also 'reinforced the notion that things can change in an instant, so he might as well live truthfully', according to the Associated Press.

In April, 34-year-old Collins came out in Sports Illustrated, becoming the first openly-gay, active player in a mainstream U.S. sport.

'I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport,' he wrote. 'But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn't the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, "I'm different."'

'If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I'm raising my hand."

Collins also wrote: 'No one wants to live in fear. I've always been scared of saying the wrong thing. I don't sleep well. I never have. But each time I tell another person, I feel stronger and sleep a little more soundly.'

After his announcement, Collins received an outpouring of support from fellow NBA players--and even the White House.

President Barack Obama said he 'couldn't be prouder' of Collins.

'The LGBT community deserves full equality, not just partial equality, not just tolerance but full equality,' he said. 'To see a role model like that, I think that's a great thing and I think America should be proud. We treat everybody fairly and everybody's part of a family. We judge people on their character and not their sexual preference.'

In his 12-season career, Collins has played for six teams. He becomes a free agent next month.
