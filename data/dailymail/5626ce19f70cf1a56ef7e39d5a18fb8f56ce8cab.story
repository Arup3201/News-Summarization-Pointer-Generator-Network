The former residence of the late Australian author, Sir Donald Horne, will go under the hammer for the first time in almost 50 years. 

The two storey terrace at 53 Grosvenor Street at Woollahra in Sydney's east, was last sold to Sir Horne and his wife for £7,700 in 1966.

James Dunn from Richardson and Wrench in Double Bay, told Daily Mail Australia that the house was being auctioned off by The Lucky Country writer's family and would likely go for over $1.75 million.

'Another house just up the road sold for around $1,902,500 just a month ago,' Mr Dunn said.

'This is a very sought after street and area because the 2B zoning allows for mixed use of commercial and residential property uses and because people want to be this close to Bondi Junction – the shops and park and the train station.'

Featuring four bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms, the Victorian home still includes many classic period details.

James Dunn, from Richardson and Wrench in Double Bay, said the house was likely to be sold for over $1.75 million

'It's all original, it hasn't been touched or changed since they bought it,' Mr Dunn said.

'There are the pressed ceilings in the living and dining rooms, the original marble fireplaces and the beautiful big garden in the back. It's quite special.'

Mr Dunn said the study on the second floor, which features a floor to ceiling bookcase and a stunning fireplace, was Sir Horne's study where many of his novels were written.

He said the prime location of the terrace, which was close to Bondi Junction, was attracting many buyers

The grand white terrace will go up for auction on November 18 and according to Mr Dunn, has already had strong interest from potential buyers.

'We've got all sorts of people looking at the property – families looking to downsize, young families and people looking to use it for commercial purposes as well,' Mr Dunn said.

'We have met a lot of Donald Horne fans, but we are not yet aware of anyone in particular who is looking to buy it just for that reason.'
