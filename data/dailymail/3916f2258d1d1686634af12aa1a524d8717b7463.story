Craig Kieswetter is facing a battle to save his career after being ruled out for the whole of next year with the serious eye injury he suffered last season.

The Somerset keeper-batsman, only last week named in England’s provisional World Cup squad, will be missing indefinitely after struggling to regain the vision needed to perform at the highest level.

It is another harsh reminder of the dangers inherent in cricket, with the sport still reeling from the death of Phillip Hughes after he, like Kieswetter, was struck on the head after mistiming a pull shot while batting in a first-class game.

Kieswetter’s injury came in July when he damaged his eye socket and cheekbone and broke his nose when a ball from Northamptonshire’s David Willey smashed through his helmet grille.

He posted horrific pictures of his injuries on Twitter but was fit enough to resume his career towards the end of the season.

Problems re-emerged during the recent South African domestic Twenty20 tournament and he will now undergo further specialist rehabilitation.

A Somerset statement admitted that it was ‘unlikely’ that Kieswetter, 27, would be fit for the 2015 domestic season while chief executive Guy Lavender confirmed to Sportsmail that ‘we just don’t know’ when the South African-born player would be fit again.

Matt Maynard, the new Somerset director of cricket, admitted the extent of concern over Kieswetter when he said: ‘This is clearly worrying news for Craig and his health and well-being are paramount in our minds.

‘We will continue to support him during his treatment and rehabilitation and hope to see him return to playing as soon as possible.’

Kieswetter, who has made 46 one-day international appearances for England, said: ‘It’s really disappointing but my eye is not a hundred per cent and this is critical in maintaining the levels of performance that I expect of myself.

‘I need to make every effort to resolve the matter and have the best specialist help in that regard.’

The news will further increase scrutiny on the effectiveness of helmets and add pressure on manufacturers to come up with more improvements as they seek to reduce the risks involved in facing a heavy ball propelled at speed.

And it is a huge blow to Somerset, who lost Jos Buttler to Lancashire after plumping for Kieswetter as their No1 keeper in all cricket last year.

In the short term Kieswetter, one of the most effective Twenty20 hitters in the game, has been ruled out of Australia’s Big Bash and has seen any remote hopes he had of featuring in England’s final World Cup squad disappear.

More importantly, at 27, he faces a fight to see whether he will ever be able to recover sufficiently to take his place back at Taunton again.
