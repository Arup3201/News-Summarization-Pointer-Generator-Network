She could have had caviar and canapes but Pippa Middleton was clearly in the mood for something a little more down to earth last night.

Fresh from an appearance at the Cheltenham Festival last week, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister was spotted heading into West London hotdog restaurant, Bubbledogs, last night.

Joined by stockbroker boyfriend, Nico Jackson, fitness fanatic Pippa looked fresh and happy in a chic leather jacket, simple beige blouse and black skinny jeans, accessorised with a gorgeous nude Vienna tote by hip British brand,Â Milli Millu.

Chums: The couple were joined by friends for their hotdog and champagne supper

Tanned Jackson looked equally relaxed and was dapper in a neat black coat and white shirt, a dove grey scarf jauntily protruding from the collar.

While the choice of venue was relatively low key, West London's Bubbledogs doesn't exactly offer the humble fare found in burger vans.

The restaurant specialises in so called gourmet hotdogs, which include the 'K-Dawg', which comes with Korean pickled cabbage dish, kimchi, fermented red bean paste and lettuce, and the 'Reuben', which is a delicious sounding mix of sauerkraut, Russian dressing and melted Swiss cheese.

The hotdogs are served with champagne, which can be bought by the glass and, according to the restaurant, is produced by artisan wineries.

Fun: Pippa and her friends looked to be in high spirits as they were driven away

Shy? Pippa stayed a few feet behind Nico who looked more interested in his phone than the socialite

Pippa has just returned from a week in the glamorous Swiss ski resort of St Moritz, where, like her sister Kate and Prince Harry before her, she went public with her new romance.

The 29-year-old was seen planting a kiss on the 35-year-old stockbroker's lips on the ski slope and the pair were all smiles when they went for lunch with friends in the Swiss resort, where they were seen pausing to look at a jewellery store's window display as they strolled arm-in-arm.

Pippa and Nico have been dating since they met on a different ski trip earlier this year.

Attention: Pippa kept her eyes lowered to avoid the camera flashes while Nico fiddled with his mobile

That's better! Pippa was all smiles once safely in the back of the car surrounded by friends

Stylish: Hip London restaurant, Bubbledogs, specialises in fast food with a luxury twist
