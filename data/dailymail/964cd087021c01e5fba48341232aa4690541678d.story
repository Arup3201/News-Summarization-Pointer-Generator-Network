A Django Unchained actress who allegedly had sex with her boyfriend in a car has blamed society and the shooting of teenager Michael Brown for why she accused police of 'racially profiling' her.

Daniele Watts claimed she was harassed by Los Angeles Police Department officers after they arrested her as she straddled her boyfriend Brian James Lucas in a silver Mercedes in Studio City.

Watts, who is black, and her white partner were having sex in the vehicle near the CBS TV studios at the time, according to witnesses. However, the actress has maintained they were only kissing.

Now, she has blamed the killing of 18-year-old Brown in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson - as well as her own history of allegedly racial profiling - for why she 'exploded' at police.

Speaking at a panel discussion at USC's School of Law on Monday, Watts said: 'If we're going to condemn me, then we also have to look at the entire society that I am a product of.'

Referring to Brown's death at the hands of officer Darren Wilson on August 9, she added: 'At a certain point, enough is enough and somebody has to say something.'

Watts also told listeners that witnessing her black father being profiled by a white policeman when she was 16 had influenced her to pull the race card on officers on September 11, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

The actress was detained by LAPD Sargaent Jim Parker after he responded to complaints that a couple was engaging in a 'lewd sex act' and she refused to provide identification when asked.

Although Watts was released with no charges at the time, a subsequent investigation 'revealed witnesses who were willing to provide evidence of a criminal act,' said a department spokesman.

Two weeks ago, the star and Lucas were charged with misdemeanor lewd conduct by the Los Angeles city attorney's office. The couple have said they are 'appalled' by the charges.

As the case hit the headlines in September, Watts was lambasted for 'crying wolf' by numerous civil rights activists, including Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable President, Earl Ofari Hutchinson.

Hutchinson, who initially supported Watts's racial profiling allegations but later changed his tune, told reporters: 'We take racial profiling very seriously. It's not a play thing. It's not trivial.' 

In an audio recording, Watts could be confronting police in a heated exchange during which she used the N-word, and claimed legal expertise from her experience playing a cop on TV.

'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me,' she told officers through tears.

'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.' 

The release of the audio file came shortly after still images showed Watts - who played Coco in the 2012 film Django Unchained - straddling Lucas in a parked car in public. 

Allegations: Watts is perhaps best known for her small role in Django Unchained, playing a slave called Coco (left). She posted the picture on the right to Facebook, claiming she was injured in the September 11 arrest

Sgt Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, later said he was offended by claims that Watts was harassed because she is a black woman with a white boyfriend.

He said he feared that if he and other officers had not recorded their run-in with Watts, her allegations would have ruined their careers.  

Watts was joined at the panel discussion by USC professors Camille Gear Rich, Michelle Gordon, Shana Redmond and Diana Williams.

She reportedly hoped the event would lead to broader societal conversation about race.

Brown's shooting in Missouri in August sparked violent demonstrations in the city of Ferguson, with many residents claiming the teenager was gunned down by Mr Wilson because of his race.

A grand jury is considering the evidence from the incident. They are expected to reach a conclusion this month.

 Watts and Lucas are due to appear in court on November 13. If convicted, they could each face a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
