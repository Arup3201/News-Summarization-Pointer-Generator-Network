A stately home in the rolling Welsh countryside has been put up for rent for the first time in its 300 year history - at the same price as a two-bed apartment in London.

The luxury mansion, which stands in ten acres of land, can be rented for the princely sum of £5,000 a month.

For that price tenants of Tythegston Court can enjoy the house's nine bedrooms, a grand entrance hall and staircase, reception rooms, billiard room, outdoor pool, tennis court, stables and landscaped gardens.

Luxury: Tythegston Court in South Wales has nine bedrooms, a grand entrance hall and staircase reception rooms, billiard room, outdoor pool, tennis court, stables and beautiful landscaped gardens

Bargain: The manor house can be rented for £5,000 a month - the same as a two-bedroom flat in Kensington

But for the same money you could rent a two-bedroom apartment in Kensington or a three-bedroom fourth floor flat in west London's exclusive Notting Hill.

The estate agents handling Tythegston Court in the Vale of Glamorgan say it will appeal to anyone wanting to quit the city for an upmarket country lifestyle.

Angus Harley, of property consultancy Knight Frank, said: 'This is a truly exceptional chance to rent one of the country's most historic houses.

Tea in the drawing room? This historic home is beautifully decorated inside and is available just to let

Superior living: The house comes with its very own games room and enough space for a full size snooker table

'People think nothing of handing over this sort of sum to rent a nice but fairly modest place in London.

'It is a little known fact that at one time many large country houses were let out. As a tenant one enjoys all the pleasures of wonderful lifestyle without any of the concerns that can go with outright ownership.

'After a few years of superior living, you can simply hand it back and walk way.'

The Grade II listed property - two and a half hours by car from London, is available for rent between one and five years.

Whilst five grand a month gets you a mansion in Wales, it covers much more modest dwellings in London.

If you are all about location, location, location a one-bedroom flat near Chelsea’s exclusive Sloane Square is on the market for £4,767 a month. 

A short walk away on equally flashy Brompton Place, Knightsbridge, a two-bedroom flat will set you back £4,983 – but it does include access to a private terrace.

For the same monthly rent, estate agent Curtis Sloane offering ‘Holland Park’s finest properties’ are advertising a two-bedroom flat to prospective tenants near Notting Hill Gate.

No gardens, tennis courts or outdoor pools but a W11 post code, which in London is worth thousands.

Downsizing: For the same money you can rent a two bedroom flat in Kensington (Portland Road is pictured)

Fancy: Tythegston has been in the ownership of the Knight family for 300 years and was renovated in 2000

Bit of a commute: The Grade II listed property is two and a half hours by car from London

Roomy: A smaller study or office style room would be perfect for family meetings or working from home

The estate agents say it gives Downton Abbey a run for its money in terms of aspirational country splendour.

Tythegston Court dates back to medieval times but the current mansion was built in the late 1700s.

The new tenant will have access, by arrangement, to the significant 1,200 acre Tythegston country estate for riding and walking.

The
 details on the property say: 'The interior of the house is grand yet 
manageable in proportions, with generous rooms including a magnificent 
hall and staircase and the fascinating medieval tower.

Spacious: The house comes with its own drive way and turning circle with space for several motors

Gated: The house also comes with a suite of offices which could works as a business headquarters

'There is a suite of offices which would work perfectly as a private office or low key business headquarters.

'The West Wing of the house consists of a self contained apartment occupied by a caretaker couple. Housekeeping and gardening help may be available by separate negotiation.

Tythegston has been in the ownership of the Knight family for 300 years and underwent a complete renovation in 2000.

It is the first time it has been made available to rent.
