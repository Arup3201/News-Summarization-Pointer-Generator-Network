Bribery and corruption at ‘breathtaking levels’ costs Europe’s economy £100billion a year, a major report revealed yesterday.

Three-quarters of people across the continent felt corruption was widespread in their own country, according to research by the European Commission.

Even in Britain, nearly six in ten said ‘bribery and connections’ were often the easiest way to get the best out of public services.

Greece is considered to be the most corrupt nation in the EU, on a par with China

EU home affairs commissioner Cecilia 
Malmstrom said the extent of the problem was ‘breathtaking’ and that 
corruption was a ‘tumour on the body politic’.

But the report axed questions on the Commission’s own record, despite claims £4billion a year is lost to fraud from its budget.

The
 Commission has been widely criticised for failing to take its own 
corruption problems seriously. Its anti-corruption agency Olaf has a 
budget of just £20million a year.

But yesterday’s report from Brussels focused instead on the scale of corruption in individual member states.

Ms Malmstrom said: ‘In a Europe that has barely come out of the economic crisis, we cannot afford to drag our feet any longer.’

Italy is also regarded as a particularly corrupt nation

The
 new survey found that three-quarters of people across the EU felt that 
corruption was widespread in their country. The figure for the UK was 64
 per cent.

The worst 
affected country is Greece, where 99 per cent of people think corruption
 is rife. The least corrupt is Denmark, where just 20 per cent of people
 feel there is a major problem.

The
 new study also reveals also reveals that eight out of ten people 
believe that close links between business and politics lead to 
corruption.

‘Europe’s 
problem is not so much with small bribes on the whole,’ said Carl Dolan 
of Transparency International in Brussels. ‘It’s with the ties between 
the political class and industry.

‘There
 has been a failure to regulate politicians’ conflicts of interest in 
dealing with business,’ he added.

‘The rewards for favouring companies, 
in allocating contracts or making changes to legislation, are positions 
in the private sector when they have left office rather than a bribe.’

The
 report comes shortly after Romania’s former prime minister, Adrian 
Nastase, was sent to jail for four years for taking bribes.

He was the 
first premier to be put behind bars since the collapse of communism in 
Europe in 1989.

The EU has 
repeatedly raised concerns about a failure to tackle high-level 
corruption in Romania and Bulgaria, the bloc’s two poorest members. They
 have been blocked from joining the passport-free Schengen zone over the
 issue since their entry.

In
 October 2012, former European health commissioner John Dalli was forced
 to quit after an associate was accused of asking for 60million euros 
from a tobacco company in return for influencing EU tobacco law.
