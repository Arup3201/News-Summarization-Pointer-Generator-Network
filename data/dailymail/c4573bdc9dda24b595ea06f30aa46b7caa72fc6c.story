Councils in Kensington and Chelsea claim bins attract more litter

A council has decided to remove all litter bins from residential streets with the extraordinary claim they ‘attract more rubbish’.

Officials in Kensington and Chelsea claim bins encourage fly-tipping and increase - rather than decrease - the level of litter on the streets.

The West London borough is home to some of the most expensive houses in the UK, with some costing many millions of pounds.

From now on, passers-by will only be allowed to dispose of rubbish in busy areas, including shopping and tourist streets.

Last night, residents hit out at the plans, which they say would lead to more rubbish building up outside their homes.

Amanda Salvesen, 27, a PR manager from Earl’s Court, said: ‘I don’t think they have asked the local residents. They are always full, people use them. They should be adding more, not taking them away.’

But the council defended its position by saying businesses were dumping large quantities of waste in the bins.

In a trial in Earl’s Court Road, council officers reported only a very slight increase in littering when bins were removed.

Kathy Way, head of waste at the council, said in a report: ‘There are two schools of thought regarding litter bins; one is that litter bins are needed for the public to use, indeed that some members of the public look for litter bins in which to deposit waste, otherwise they may take it home or drop it on the street.

‘The other is that litter bins attract more rubbish, some of which can be unpaid-for commercial waste and domestic waste.’

The scheme follows the council’s ‘naked 
streets’ policy of taking away all road markings, signs and pedestrian 
barriers from Exhibition Road.

It is the first council in London to pursue an anti-bin strategy which, could be repeated elsewhere if successful.

The move was prompted by the fact that its bins have been on the streets for more than 15 years and are costly to repair or replace, the Evening Standard reported.

Kensington and Chelsea is home to Egerton Crescent, which was last year named the most expensive street in Britain.
