The body of an elderly woman has been found inside a home that partially collapsed during a fire overnight.

Fire services were called to a house in Green Lane, Woodstock, Oxfordshire shortly after 1am.

Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service teams immediately began to search the property as they believed someone was trapped in the building.

They managed to get search part of the ground and first floors - but when part of the building collapsed they had to evacuate.

The body of a woman, aged in her 70s, was later discovered at the property.

The woman, whose next-of-kin have been informed, is thought to be the owner of the home.

Four fire engines attended the blaze.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'The woman's next-of-kin has been informed.

'Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and Thames Valley Police are jointly working to establish a cause of the fire however early indications suggest the fire is not believed to be suspicious.'

Fire crews and police remain on the scene and the road has been closed.
