Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has launched a furious attack on her country’s national broadcaster, saying: ‘It’s not France Television anymore, it’s left-wing television!’

The 44-year-old multimillionaire heiress is still reeling from her husband Nicolas Sarkozy losing the presidential election ten days ago.

Mr Sarkozy, a right-wing conservative, was widely considered to be the most unpopular head of state in French history before he was rejected after just one term in office.

He was replaced by Francois Hollande, France’s first Socialist president in 17 years – prompting Ms Bruni-Sarkozy to suggest a conspiracy theory.

She told Le Point political weekly that Mr Sarkozy had been victimised by a ‘relentless’ group of left wing journalists working for France Television, the state owned company which incorporates channels including France 2 and France 3,saying all made up 'left wing television'.

Ms Bruni-Sarkozy spent much of the election campaign defending ‘my man’ against what she saw as character attacks, and said she had also been victimised.

‘There’s this girl called Carla Bruni who does things that I do not do, who says things I do not say,’ she said, accusing reporters of creating an unpopular ‘clone’ of her.

Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, a former supermodel and self-styled pop ‘artist’, used to be an avowed Socialist, leading a flamboyantly liberal lifestyle on Paris’s Left Bank.

Her numerous former lovers included English rock stars Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton, and she admitted that ‘monogamy bores me’.

But she gave up such views when she became Mr Sarkozy’s third wife following a whirlwind romance of just 80 days in 2008.

Now she styles herself as a loyal conservative wife and mother to the couple’s seven-month-old daughter, Giulia.

Mr Sarkozy, who lived at the Elysee Palace until Tuesday, has now moved full time into his wife’s Paris mansion, and they are expected to go on a long sunshine holiday within the next few days.
