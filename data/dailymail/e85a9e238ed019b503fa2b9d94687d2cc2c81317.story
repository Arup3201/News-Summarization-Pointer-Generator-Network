A 13-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to murdering a builder after a row outside a block of flats, making him one of Britain's youngest killers.

The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted stabbing 53-year-old Christopher John Barry to death in Edmonton, north London, in December last year.

Mr Barry was said to have been involved in a row with a group of youths trying to get into a party at another address in the block of flats where he lived.

Mr Barry was said to have been involved in a row with a group of youths trying to get into a party at the block of flats in Edmonton, north London

The attack happened as he returned home with his girlfriend, council worker Sabrina Finn.

He was followed into the building by two of the boys before being stabbed in the chest, police said.

Ambulance crews attended but he was pronounced dead on the doorstep of his own home.

The defendant's parents as well as relatives of Mr Barry, who was known as Jack and was originally from Cobh, Ireland, all attended the Old Bailey for the five-minute hearing.

After being brought into the dock from custody, the boy spoke to his father briefly before the charge was put to him by the court clerk.

When asked to confirm his name, the boy replied: 'Erm ... yes.'

His guilty plea to a single count of murder was almost inaudible.

Dressed in a light blue shirt and grey school trousers, he was remanded into youth custody by judge Anthony Morris.

The judge ordered a pre-sentence report ahead of sentencing on April 10, where the teenager will face a minimum of 12 years in prison.

Detective Chief Inspector Neale Baldock, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, who is leading the investigation, said at the time of the murder: 'The victim and this group were not known to each other - what started as a minor verbal altercation has escalated into a shocking act of violence.'

Residents of the block of flats described seeing 'blood everywhere' on the landing outside Mr Barry's home on the night he was killed. 

Shifal Kemal, 38, a neighbour of Mr Barry, described him as a 'nice man' who always smiled when he greeted people.

The NHS worker said: 'I cried quite a lot when I heard. I knew Jack slightly to smile and say hello to, but I know his girlfriend Sabrina more, and she is a lovely, lovely girl.

'We've been living here for nearly eight years and I think they must have been living here for around the same time.

'He was such a nice man. Every time we saw him he would always be really polite, smile, and say hello.

'They both worked and would leave early in the morning and come back late in the evening, so we didn't know too much about them. But they are both lovely people, who kept themselves to themselves.'

Another neighbour Steven Gregory, 42, said Miss Finn had complained about homeless people getting into the block of homes.

He said: 'They would leave beer cans, and cigarettes everywhere. We've always had troubles with people trying to get into the block, this times it looks like it was kids.'

Miss Kemal added: 'It's terrible and quite scary.

'We've always had trouble in this block with homeless people getting in and causing a nuisance on the stairwell or landings, and leaving lots of rubbish behind.

'We've also had problems with kids getting into the building, and knocking on doors.'
