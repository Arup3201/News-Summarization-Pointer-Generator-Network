These adorable pictures show baby panda cubs playing a hiding game before indulging in some rough and tumble with each other at a Chinese zoo.

The playful pair were captured attempting to conceal their faces with their paws as they played with each other at a zoo in the Zhejiang province earlier today.

But the fun and games didn't last long before descending into a lighthearted wrestling match as the mischievous bears rolled around on the floor.

The pair clamber over each other as their fun and games descends into play fighting and lively wrestling

The cubs can be seen lazing around on rocks in their enclosure  before participating in the children's game.

They appear to be giving each other a cuddle as they clamber on top of one another in a friendly fight.

The young bears, which are expected to grow somewhere between four and six feet in length, stare into each others eyes before trying to frighten the other.

In the wild, pandas tend to be solitary with each adult having a defined territory, which they mark by clawing trees or spraying urine.

After becoming a target for poachers, the animals became endangered and like the playful pair in the pictures, many are now kept in captivity.
