Paris Jackson and her brothers will remain under the guardianship of their grandmother Katherine and cousin TJ, a judge ruled on Tuesday.

The decision follows an investigation into the well-being of the late Michael Jackson's three children after Paris, 15, was hospitalised on June 5 when she overdosed on pills and cut herself in a failed suicide attempt.

Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff ordered an investigator to interview Jackson's children, including Prince, 16, and Blanket, 11, and report back to him.

Judge Beckloff said he was taking 'no further action' and the current guardianship set-up, which is shared between Katherine and TJ, will remain in place.

The decision came on the anniversary of Michael Jackson's death, who died on June 25, 2009, from a fatal dose of Propofol.

Meanwhile, TMZ reports Paris and Prince's biological mother Debbie Rowe is happy with the guardianship set-up for now.

But according to the celebrity website, she is prepared to file legal documents to get custody if the situations worsens again.

Perry Sanders Jr., an attorney for Katherine Jackson, has said Paris is physically fine and receiving proper medical attention. He 
has not provided further updates on her condition.

Sanders and

inquiry was an expected move and they supported his decision.

Tuesday also saw loyal fans of the King Of Pop pays their respects by sending flowers to the Forest Lawn cemetery in Los Angeles.

According to TMZ one fan group - called One Rose For Michael Jackson - gave 10,000 to the grave site.

People will continue to be allowed to pay their tributes throughout the day and the flowers at Jackson's mausoleum will be left there for the rest of the week.

Britney Spears - who performed with Michael in 2001 - sent her thoughts to the Jackson family via Twitter, writing: 'My thoughts are with the Jackson family today. Honored to have shared a stage with him. Miss u Michael!'

Jackson's anniversary comes against the backdrop of an ongoing wrongful death lawsuit - a civil case filed by his mother Katherine against against AEG Live LLC, the promoter of Jackson's ill-fated concerts.

Anniversary: Jackson, who died from a fatal dose of Propofol on June 25, 2009, seen here just months before his death announcing his comeback concerts

Jackson's mother wants a jury to 
determine that the promoters of her son's planned comeback concerts 
didn't properly investigate Dr 
Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter by a 
criminal jury for Jackson's June 2009 death.

AEG Live's lead defence attorney has pointed to the secrecy of Jackson's
 'upstairs lifestyle' - where the superstar was receiving nightly doses of
 the anesthetic propofol in his locked bedroom - to support the 
company's contention it couldn't have known about Jackson's drug 
treatments.

AEG's attorney also says the case is about personal choice, namely Jackson's decision to have Murray serve as his doctor and give him doses of a powerful anesthetic as a sleep aid. Millions, possibly billions, of dollars are at stake.

Jackson spent the final months of his life in a rented mansion in the upscale Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles.

The mansion had all the amenities fit 
for a pop superstar - a palatial entryway, staircase and parlor and in 
the basement, a home theater and dance studio.

The
 house was a hub of activity, with security guards posted outside, a 
pair of housekeepers, a nanny for the children and on many days, a 
personal chef stationed in the kitchen.

Dinners
 at the home occasionally featured special guests, including Jackson's 
personal physician Conrad Murray and choreographer Travis Payne.

But staffers and guests other than Murray weren't allowed upstairs, where the bedrooms were.

Meanwhile, Michael's brothers Jackie, 
Marlon, Tito and Jermaine Jackson took the day of memorial to honour

The brothers told TMZ:
 'Four years ago today we lost one of the greatest musicians, 
entertainers, and icons the world has ever known. But to us, Michael was
 first and foremost our brother. We carry his spirit with us always, and
 we love and miss him every day.'

Randy
 Jackson, who is the youngest brother in the family, also tweeted on the
 sad day: 'Thinking about my brother on this day. Thank U everyone 4 
your love and support and 4 the beautiful display of flowers at Forest 
Lawn.'
