The man suspected to be the Swiss cheese pervert was arrested at his home in Philadelphia on Thursday at gunpoint.

Christopher Pagano was taken into custody by Norristown police after an investigation by authorities led them to believe he was the man harassing local women.

The 41-year-old has allegedly been driving around town and approaching women asking them if they would like to pleasure his genitals with a slice of Swiss cheese.

'He was a weirdo,' neighbor Rae Dean told NBC10's Deanna Durante. 'He used to come outside in his underwear with no shirt.'

Hands up: Christopher Pagano was arrested at his home on Noble Street in Norristown on Thursday

The 41-year-old has allegedly been driving around town and approaching women asking them if they would like to pleasure his genitals with a slice of Swiss cheese.

Sources at the Philadelphia Police 
Department’s Special Victims Unit have indicated that Chris Pagano is 
the 'subject' of their investigation and added that is was 'possible' an
 arrest would be made after several women came forward to give 
statements believed to be about the Norristown resident.

This
 comes as unearthed court documents and a mugshot from 2009 reveal that 
Pagano, 41, was arrested after he allegedly 'removed a large block of 
cheese from his pocket' and asked a woman on the street if it would be 
alright to give her '$20 to rub the Swiss cheese on his penis.'

However,
 Pagano has denied that he is the man who has been driving around the 
Mayfair area of Philadelphia in recent weeks propositioning women to 
pleasure him with slices of cheese.

At the time of his 2009 arrest, Pagano pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct but a solicitation charge against him was dismissed.

A reporter from The Philadelphia Magazine traveled to Pagano's home on Wednesday morning to ask him if he was indeed the now infamous Swiss cheese pervert who has been terrorizing the Mayfair suburb of the city in recent weeks.

Pictured by at least two victims, the fetishist has been described as an overweight man in his 40s who drives around in his car approaching women with his genitals exposed.

According to his victims, he then dangles a large slice of Swiss cheese over his penis and offers to pay the women to perform sexual acts on him using the snack.

Pagano, who is believed to be married, flatly denied being the Swiss cheese pervert, saying, 'I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sometimes people confuse me with somebody else.'

However, the picture used by Pagano on his Facebook - which has now been set to private - and the pictured attached to an OkCupid profile message sent to a woman asking her to indulge his cheese craving are the same.

More-so, mugshots have emerged of Pagano from arrests in 2006 and 2009 after separate incidents both involving cheese according to law enforcement sources who spoke to Philadelphia Magazine.

Cheesy: The Mayfair Town Watch warned women of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert,' pictured, on its Facebook page earlier this year

An affidavit of probable cause given to the Norristown Police Department outlines a report of attempted sexual assault.

A woman - who is not being identified - said that she was approached by a man approximately just after midnight and asked if she would have sex with him.

'The male removed a large block of cheese from his pocket and told [Ms. Doe] that he would pay her $20 to rub the swiss cheese on his penis.

'[Ms. Doe] became alarmed and fled on foot toward her residence. The male offered [Ms. Doe] more money as she fled the area.'

In the affidavit the woman 'identified Christopher Pagano as the person that asked her to place cheese on his penis.'

Going back three years to 2006, Pagano was again arrested and charged with solicitation and disorderly conduct according to the Philadelphia Magazine.

The Norristown Police Department was unable to confirm that cheese was involved in this incident, however detective James Angelucci, who worked the 2006 and 2009 case said that he thought it was.

'I was working the 2006 detail as well,' said Angelucci. 'And I believe cheese was on the menu, but I’m not completely sure. If my memory serves me, it was Swiss.'

The Mayfair Town Watch warned local ladies of the lurking man on its Facebook page Saturday, and Philadelphia Police Department has confirmed the Special Victims Unit is investigating the curious case after several women filed reports describing a man with a 'major sexual cheese fetish.'

'I understand that people may think this is funny, but this is no laughing matter,' Milt Martelack, the town watch's senior adviser, told the Philadelphia Daily News.

'We've had a couple individuals reach out to us. We're taking this matter very seriously, and we're working vigorously with police to get this guy off the streets.'

The 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' is heavyset and white and drives a silver or black sedan.

Victim: A woman tweeted this picture of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' with the comment 'I met this dude a few weeks ago' #creep

The bizarre case shocked many residents but Gabby Chest, from nearby Bridesburg, recognized the fetish straight away and made her own report to police.

In July 2012, when she was just 19, she set up a profile on dating site OkCupid and within days had an inbox from a 'really strange guy' with a very specific request.

'He said he was looking for someone to perform masturbation on him with cheese,' Ms Chest told the Daily News. 'He kept saying how strong his urges were and how desperate he was to find someone to help him with them.'

She added: 'There's no doubt it was him; it looked exactly like the picture on his profile. I was scared and shocked. I never thought the guys you see on those sites would be so close to me.'

In the message, the man called 'Chris' explained he developed the fetish after struggling to find women and start relationships as a young man because he was overweight and always judged on his looks.

'So I developed this fetish to help me deal with my sexual urges,' he wrote.

'I found that women tend to like dairy products, and settled on cheese to represent the girl. thus I started having sex with cheese.'

Another woman, commenting on a Phillymag.com story, shared an OKCupid message her sister received from 'Chris' some four years ago, which was even more shocking.

'I love the way Swiss cheese feels against my penis. Either as slices of Swiss cheese being wrapped around my penis or a chunk of Swiss cheese being rubbed against my penis,' he wrote.

Swiss is best: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best,' 'Chris' wrote in an OKCupid message to a 19-year-old girl (stock photo)

'I love even more when a woman uses the Swiss cheese to pleasure me. Or simply wraps Swiss cheese slices around my penis and allows me to hang out with her as I wear the cheese.'

He explained that he prefers having sex with cheese over traditional sex and jokes 'I am lucky I never became a rapist,' suggesting this was an alternative to his fromage infatuation.

Chis went on: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best. First and foremost, if ever a picture of cheese is used, most of the time they use a representation of Swiss cheese. But also because of it's eye patterns, texture, and the way it feels against my penis.'

While he didn't offer Ms Chest cash in exchange for the sexual favor, so as not to suggest she was a prostitute, he did offer this young woman $50 if she'd pleasure him using his preferred method.

He described in the expansive letter, however, that when he was younger he had far more stamina for cheese sex.

'I was able to wrap and wear a good 1 ½ pounds of Swiss cheese against my penis, and wear the Swiss cheese for hours at a time, before I would climax from just having the Swiss cheese on my penis,' Chris wrote.

But in a strange twist, he insists he doesn't like Swiss cheese, only mozzarella, and would never consumer the cheese he has used on himself.

'One last note, I do not like cheese, except for mozzarella, and that is the one cheese I have never used on myself,' he explained. 'So no I do not eat the cheese after I am done using it for pleasure, it is discarded. I am always asked that question.'
