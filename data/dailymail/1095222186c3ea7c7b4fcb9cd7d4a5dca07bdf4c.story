Newcastle are closing on a £6million deal for Monaco striker Emmanuel Riviere ahead of competition from West Bromwich Albion.

They also hope to conclude the £9.5m transfer of Montpellier midfielder Remy Cabella but have had a £4m offer rejected for Feyenoord defender Daryl Janmaat.

Target: Emmanuel Riviere is expected to move to Newcastle from Monaco

Riviere, 24, has represented France at all levels but is yet to be capped for the full side.

The powerful striker has scored 45 times and assisted a further 30 in 158 Ligue appearances.
