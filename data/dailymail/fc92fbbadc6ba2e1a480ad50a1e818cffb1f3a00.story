Fans of the Comedy Central's comedian Nathan Fielder put their relationships on the line to take part in another cruel prank.

Fielder, who recently encouraged teenagers to text their parents about a fake drug deal, took to Twitter on Wednesday to ask his 70,000 followers to send a message their partner saying: 'I haven't been fully honest with you'.

In a cruel repeat of his drug deal prank, his followers were told to not respond to any texts or phone calls for one hour after sending the message.

Cruel: Comedian Nathan Fielder encouraged his Twitter followers to text the person they are dating

What might have seemed a funny idea at the time, quickly backfired as relationships were destroyed and trust lost.

David Pina was one of many who instantly regretted taking part in the prank. He later tweeted on Fielder's page: 'Thought it'd be funny but now I completely regret it. 2 years down the drain.'

In a fit of anger, his now ex-girlfriend
 berated and belittled him, before confessing that she 'Did hook up with
 your best friend on New Years'.

Demands: Many pleaded for more information, but the Twitter followers had been told to stay quiet for an hour

Acceptance: Some people took the cryptic message calmly, expressing a wish to 'end' the relationship well

One prank texter was ordered to 'find another place to sleep tonight', and several had their lives threatened by irate girlfriends.

While nearly all jumped to conclusions, believing they had been cheated on, a few took the news better than expected.

And while some made accusations, one woman's response was to ask her boyfriend to delete 'All my stuff of ur phone n computer ... I'm not tryna end up on world star'.

An eye-catching response to one of Fielder's fans, called Ethan, read: 'This better not be Panama City all over again, Ethan. 
Call me back now or we're done'.

But others were already in on the joke. After demanding to know if 'This [is] about what you've been doing at the "gym",' Carly texted back: 'Are you going to tell me you got 2 grams for $40 next?' in reference to the star of Nathan For You's last prank.

Caught out: While some were already in on the joke, for others the message brought up painful memories

Baffling: Many hoping for a funny response to share on the comic's Twitter page were stumped by their replies

One girl, who chose to text her mother rather than someone she was dating, received a shocking reply saying 'I was afraid u were gonna tell me u were out getting an abortion'.

For others however, what started as a joke ended up eliciting confessions from their loved ones, or cliff-hanger responses such as one that simply read: 'Me neither...'
