An Indian journalist has been criticised for appearing on television reporting from a disaster zone while sitting on the shoulders of one of a flood victim.

Narayan Pargaien was in the state of Uttarakhand reporting on floods which have devastated the region when he made his unorthodox broadcast for News Express.

But he has denied the suggestion that he exploited the man by sitting on his shoulders while on camera, insisting that the flood victim 'wanted to show respect' because he had never met anyone as important as the journalist before.

Controversy: TV reporter Narayan Pargaien has come under fire for filming a report from a disaster region while sitting on the shoulders of a victim of the floods

A video of Mr Pargaien reporting on the floods swept the internet when it was posted to YouTube earlier this month, with many Indian web users criticising him for apparently using a disaster victim to keep his feet dry.

One commenter denounced him as 'a disgrace to journalism', while another said he was 'a ridiculous reporter'.

In an interview Mr Pargaien, who has nearly two decades of reporting experience, admitted that he was wrong to file the unorthodox report, but said that he only sat on the man's shoulders after the victim had invited him to do so.

He also blamed his cameraman for revealing the bizarre arrangement, claiming that he had been told he would only be filmed from the waist up.

'It wasn't my idea to begin with, but there was this man who took me to his home and asked me to report the damage he had suffered,' Mr Pargaien told News Laundry.

'His house was in a miserable condition and he had lost a lot in the flood, and was left with very little food and water.

'We helped him with some food and some money and he was grateful to us and wanted to show me some respect, as it was the first time someone of my level had visited his house.'

The reporter added that he had paid the man, whom he refused to name, 50 rupees (55p) for his troubles.

He admitted that his actions were 'journalistically wrong', adding that he had 'no problem getting my feet wet'.

But Mr Pargaien appeared keen to pass blame on to his cameraman for allowing the footage to come to light, saying the report was supposed to be shown 'only with footage of me chest-up'.

He continued: 'This was entirely the cameramanâ€™s fault, who, it seems, almost tried to sabotage my career by shooting from that distance and angle and releasing the video mocking this whole incident, and making me the villain.'

The horrific floods in the northern state are believed to have killed 1,000 people, with many thousands more stranded in remote mountainous areas.
