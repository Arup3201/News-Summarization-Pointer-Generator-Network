The 8-year-old who received national attention for his touchdown run in the 2013 Nebraska spring football game has had a recurrence of brain cancer.

Jack Hoffman, from Atkinson, Nebraska had been in remission since October.

His father, Andy, said doctors found a 'spot of concern' in Jack's brain in April, and follow-up tests in Boston on Wednesday showed the tumor had grown.

Andy Hoffman wrote on Jack's CaringBridge page that the tumor would be treated with chemotherapy.

Fighter: Cancer sufferer Jack Hoffman, who became an internet sensation after his touchdown run with Nebraska, is to undergo another round of chemotherapy. Doctors have learned his brain tumor has returned

'Today we were humbly reminded that when your child has an inoperable brain tumor, that anything can happen at any point in time,' Hoffman wrote.

'Despite Jack's tumor being declared in remission (stable) last October, today we learned that that is no longer the case.

While we left Boston in April with the knowledge that there was a spot of concernâ€™, we nonetheless remained optimistic that it was just nothing.'

Jack's touchdown won an ESPY Award for best sports moment of 2013 when, with the players' help, he ran 69 yards to 
score during April 2013's intrasquad game.

Players mobbed him and lifted him on their shoulders in triumph after his 69-yard run.

The video of the play has been replayed on national TV and viewed more than 8.5 million times on YouTube.

This is not the first time the family have faced such a set back. Jack's
 tumor grew back after two surgeries in 2011, and it occupies a spot 
near his brain stem. The location is considered inoperable now, his dad said, but that could change.

Winner: Jack, who was 7 when he appeared on the pitch in April 2013, won an ESPY award for his video

Support: Nebraska's Taylor Martinez guides Jack Hoffman down the field for his touchdown play during a special segment dedicated to Hoffman during the Red-White spring NCAA college football game

Making friends: After the video went viral, he even went to the White House to meet President Obama

Doctors have been closely monitoring his condition with MRI's every three months.

Jack is a second-grader at a school near the family's home in Atkinson, a city of about 1,240 people in north-central Nebraska.

The
 brave cancer patient's chance to join the Huskers came through his 
family's friendship with the team's former star running back Rex 
Burkhead.

Burkhead 
befriended Jack shortly after the brain cancer was diagnosed in April 
2011. Their friendship grew into the Team Jack campaign that has raised 
awareness and funds for research.

'Jack
 is a fighter, a strong kid,' Burkhead said. 'To see him run around and 
enjoy the Husker experience, it's a dream come true, especially for kids
 in the state of Nebraska.'

Friends: Jack stands with former Nebraska football player Rex Burkhead after meeting with President Obama in Washington in April 2013. The team has continued to support the family throughout its battle

His video also won an ESPY award as the 'Best Moment' of the year last summer.

Jack and his dad ended up meeting with President 
Obama .

Andy Hoffman said the President presented his son with a new football and told him he was proud of him.

The rest of his family will continue to raise money for cancer research through the Team Jack Foundation.

'We're not living life in fear,' Hoffman said. 'We're busy living.'
