Just a few weeks old and Prince George is already hot property.

His first choice of outfit led to a 600% increase in orders of the 'royal swaddle'. He has several spoof Twitter accounts. And now the future king of England has been given one of Britain's highest honours: the chance to appear on the nation's best-loved soap opera.

According to a report in the Daily Star Coronation Street bosses have offered Kate And William's son a cameo role in the show to christen the programme's new set.

Uncertainty over Kate's due date meant that the historic birth wasn't covered in the soap's story lines and Creative Director John Whiston thinks a cameo appearance when the series moves to a bigger set in Salford next year might make amends.

He said: 'We want the royal baby to come and open the new street. It would be fantastic to get Kate, William and George there with a pair of tiny baby scissors.

'The soap has a long historical connection with the Royal Family so having the newest arrival on the set would be perfect.'

Coronation Street's arch rival EastEnders mentioned Prince George's birth in a scene with Dot Branning.

John said: 'We didnâ€™t have time to 
put the birth in a storyline. We did with the Jubilee but we knew what 
date that would happen!'

Prince
Charles appeared in an episode of Coronation Street on 8 December 2000 
when the show was celebrating its 40th anniversary.

He was seen in footage on a television news bulletin on a supposed visit to Weatherfield to meet Councellor Audrey Roberts.
In reality the footage was taken earlier in the day as actress Sue 
Nicholls was presented to the Prince when he visited the Granada 
studios.

Charles received a "With thanks to..." credit at the end of the instalment.
