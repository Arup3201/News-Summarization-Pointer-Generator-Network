Antarctica's icy edge is disappearing in warming ocean waters, with the last decade seeing the rate of ice loss increase dramatically.

This is according to a new study that has combined 18-years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites.

The researchers claim that some ice shelves in West Antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years.

Satellite data from 1994 to
2012 clearly shows the accelerating decline which could hasten the rise in global sea levels,
scientists say.

The findings, published today in the journal Science,
come amid concern among many scientists about the effects of
global climate change on Earth's vast, remote polar regions. 

During the study period's first half, to about 2003, the
overall volume decline around Antarctica was small, with West
Antarctica losses almost balanced out by gains in East
Antarctica.

After that, western losses accelerated and gains in
the east ended.

'There has been more and more ice being lost from
Antarctica's floating ice shelves,' said glaciologist Helen
Fricker of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the
University of California, San Diego.

Ice is added to the ice shelf by glaciers flowing off the continent and by snowfall. Ice is lost when icebergs break off the ice front, and by melting in some regions as warm water flows into the ocean cavity under the ice shelf. Under some ice shelves, cold and fresh meltwater rises to a point where it refreezes onto the ice shelf

The Crosson Ice Shelf in the Amundsen Sea and the Venable
Ice Shelf in the Bellingshausen Sea, both in West Antarctica, 
each shrank about 18 percent during the study period.

Climate change could make the food we eat taste worse, according to recent research.

A major report on the impact of global warming on food has predicted that the quality of many meats and vegetables is due to decline at temperatures increase.

The researchers predict that as heatwaves become more common, meat like chicken and beef will become stringier and tougher.

Carrots are likely to lose their flavour and develop a less pleasant texture.

Beetroots and onions will become smaller while milk will contain less protein needed to make cheese.

A separate study by marine biologists has also shown that  shellfish will take on a sour flavour as our oceans acidify.

They warn that as the planet's oceans grow more acidic, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising.

Shrimp raised in water with a lower pH were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting, while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest. 

'If the loss rates that we observed during the past two
decades are sustained, some ice shelves in the Amundsen and
Bellingshausen seas could disappear within this century,' added
Scripps geophysics doctoral candidate Fernando Paolo.

The melting of these ice shelves does not directly affect
sea levels because they are already floating.

'This is just like your glass of gin and tonic. When the ice
cubes melt, the level of liquid in the glass does not rise,'
Paolo said.

But the floating ice shelves provide a restraining force for
land-based ice, and their reduction would increase the flow of
the ice from the land into the ocean, which would increase sea
levels.

'While it is fair to say that we're seeing the ice shelves
responding to climate change, we don't believe there is enough
evidence to directly relate recent ice shelf losses specifically
to changes in global temperature,' Fricker said.

Oceanographer and co-author Laurie Padman of Earth & Space
Research in Corvallis, Oregon said for a few Antarctic ice
shelves, ice loss can be related fairly directly to warming air
temperatures. 

Much of the increased melting elsewhere is
probably due to more warm water getting under the ice shelves
because of increasing winds near Antarctica, Padman added.

Fricker said future studies will concentrate on the causes behind changes in ice shelf volume, including the effects of the atmosphere and ocean.

'We're looking into connections between El Niño events in the tropical Pacific and changes in the Antarctic ice sheet,' said Scripps graduate student Fernando Paolo.

'It's very far apart but we know that these teleconnections exist. That may ultimately allow us to improve our models for predicting future ice loss.'
