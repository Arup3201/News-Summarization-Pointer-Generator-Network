New footage, obtained exclusively by MailOnline, captures the moment actor Orlando Bloom throws a punch at Justin Bieber during a night out in Ibiza.

The incident was recorded by onlookers as Bieber crossed paths with the Pirates of the Caribbean star shortly after entering popular eatery Cipriani with his entourage.

Bloom, who wears a light coloured shirt, appears to make a beeline for the Canadian star before throwing a single punch.

Bieber's security team promptly pull the two apart before the incident spills over into the street. 

As members of their entourage engage in a
 scuffle to keep the two stars apart, Bloom is seen walking away before 
returning to gesticulate at Bieber, who sports one of his customary 
baseball caps.

Sources later claimed that Bloom hit out after the singer made a lewd comment about estranged wife Miranda Kerr's sexual prowess, telling Page Six: 'Justin was at one table, and Orlando was at another.

'But when Bieber and his party were later walking past Bloom’s table, Orlando refused to shake Bieber’s hand.

'Then “Bieber said something rude to Orlando, like, ‘She was good.'”

A separate source close to the singer has since refuted the claim, telling the same publication: 'Justin
 didn’t even know Orlando was there. But when they saw each other, it 
was Orlando who was just being an a**hole to Justin.'

Following the incident Bieber greeted fans, seemingly oblivious to the ugly scenes that had just played out with the British heartthrob.

As a throng of predominantly female onlookers neared, he cheerfully obliged them by posing for a series of snaps.

He also appeared to make light of 
his altercation with Bloom by grinning as a member of his team 
playfully raised his fists. 

Shortly
 after the incident the singer posted a picture of Bloom's estranged wife, fuelling rumours he went on a date with 
her while they were still married in 2012.

While 
representatives for Bloom and Bieber have refused to comment on the 
matter, a source on the scene has confirmed the incident to MailOnline.

Out and about: Miranda posted this shot, taken on a day out with young son Flynn, on Instagram on Wednesday afternoon

Low-blow: The 20-year-old star posted an image of his 37-year-old foe crying

We're told: 'Justin was being cordial, and everything was fine. 
But then Orlando was annoyed when he saw it was Justin and instigated by
 taking a swing at Justin.'

'Justin ducked, and Orlando's punch missed'.

Our source adds: 'People intervened, some minor pushing, then they were separated. Justin stayed for a while after.'

TMZ also report that the attempted punch took place fter the 20-year-old bad boy of music asked Bloom, 'What's up b****?'

For years it has been reported that Kerr had been seen on a date with Bieber following a Victoria's Secret show in 2012.

Clearly
 trying to irritate the situation further, Bieber then posted a picture 
of Miranda in a bikini with a symbol of a crown as a caption.

And
 Bloom also has ties to Bieber's ex, Selena Gomez; in April they were 
spotted partying together at the Forum in LA after taking in Chelsea 
Handler's Uganda Be Kidding Me show.

The location: Cipriani in Ibiza is an expensive poolside restaurant; also there were Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan

After
 Orlando made his alleged punch, the singer - who was arrested for a DUI
 in Miami earlier this year - 'fled the restaurant,' according to the 
site.

The British
 actor is almost 6ft tall and the Canadian performer is said to be 5ft 
7in. It has been guessed that Bieber actually fibs about his height and 
is more along the lines of 5ft 4in.

Cipriani
 was 'packed with celebs,' an insider said. Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan 
and Sean 'P Diddy' Combs were all reportedly in attendance at the time.

Orlando is not photographed taking a swing at the young artist, but an eyewitness told TMZ that's 'exactly what happened'.

Justin was seen with Orlando's now estranged wife Kerr at 2012 Victoria's Secret fashion show in NYC.

It was reported that the two got 'very close' after the event, despite Kerr still being married to Bloom at the time.

Kerr
 and Bloom announced their separation in October 2013 after three years 
of marriage, claiming they had split several months earlier.

When Orlando was seen with Gomez in April, it was heavily speculated that they could have been on a date.

Earlier in the day Bloom was seen with pretty women on a yacht in the Ibiza area. Erica Packer - the former spouse of Australian billionaire James Packer, who himself has been linked to Miranda, is thought to be one of them.

On Tuesday, Bieber shared a photo where he was boarding a private jet with a pal. Both were shirtless and showing off tattoos.

It is likely they were headed to Spain.

Meanwhile, Kerr was seen in Munich, Germany at an Escada event on Tuesday.

Also on Tuesday, TMZ reported that the Beverly Hills building in which Bieber has been living is hiring lawyers to deal with the star.

He has allegedly been making so much noise with his parties that police were called six times in one weekend alone this month to his unit.
