Kim Jong Un was watching his soldiers carrying out their latest invasion exercises in pictures released today, showing how the Korean peninsula remains perpetually on the brink of war.

North Korea's portly dictator stood with his military officials as soldiers leapt from hovercraft onto soggy, mist-shrouded beaches in an undisclosed location.

The 31-year-old, who followed his father and grandfather as North Korea's supreme leader, appeared to have stern words for his military men, who listened intently and took notes as he told them his views.

And I want a burger can here... Kim Jong Un is surrounded by his top military advisers as he directs military exercises at an undisclosed location on the coast of North Korea

Attack! North Korean soldiers leap from hovercraft landing vehicles on a mist-shrouded beach

Stern words: Kim apparently tells his experienced military advisers what he thinks of their strategies

Despite his military rank of Marshal and his reported five years officer education at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang, Kim wore no uniform as he directed proceedings on a large military chart.

His older, uniformed advisors peered intently as Kim outlined his strategy, keeping note of his instructions in small A6 size notebooks.

Although the photographs, all taken and distributed by the state-run Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) are undated, they presumably show drills taking place in recent days.

They come despite South Korea strongly warning North Korea against staging any military provocations ahead of today's fourth anniversary of a northern artillery attack which killed two South Korean marines and two civilians.

Much better! North Korea's supreme leader appears to be much happier with the operation now

Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min Seok was quoted by Kyodo News as saying: 'We strongly warn North Korea to remember its provocations will lead to self-destruction.'

He also demanded that North Korea's stop blaming his country for the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010, which also injured 19 people in one of the most serious incidents since the end of the Korean war.

'North Korea should stop the shameful conduct of covering the sun with hands and make an apology and punish those found responsible (for the attack),' he said.

Officer class: The north Korean dictator holds the rank of Marshal in the Korean People's Army

South Korea had earlier staged a live-firing exercise near Yeonpyeong Island on the Western sea border of North and South Korea, which northern diplomats had condemned.

A Korean People's Army statement broadcast through KCNA accused South Korea of 'driving the situation to an extreme phase through provocations in the acute hotspot waters, still without discretion.'

'The south Korean military warmongers should never forget the lesson from the bitter defeat in the Yonphyong Island shelling all the time,' the statement, translated by Kyodo News, said.
