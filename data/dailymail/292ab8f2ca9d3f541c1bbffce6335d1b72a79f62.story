X Factor judge Cheryl Cole has been crowned the nation’s most influential beauty icon.

The 30-year-old singer – who this week started filming for the new series of X Factor – topped a poll which questioned women on who most influences their beauty buys.

Ex-Corrie actress Michelle Keegan took 
second place, followed by supermodel Kate Moss. Other names who made the
 top ten include the Duchess of Cambridge, Rihanna and Jennifer Aniston –
 who Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden recently declared as her 
own beauty icon.

It is not difficult to see why women are willing to splash out to try and emulate the northern beauty's look

Cheryl often changes her look, shifting from brunette to blonde and back again, but always keeps up her high glamour finish

Iconic Hollywood actress Audrey Hepburn – star of classic films Breakfast at Tiffany’s and Roman Holiday – crept into the list at tenth place, highlighting her timeless influence on women.

The survey of 1000 women revealed celebrities’ robust influence on women’s cosmetics purchases.

A
 whopping 80 per cent of women said they would definitely buy products 
their favourite beauty icon had used in an attempt to emulate their 
look.

Most women were not concerned by the A-list price tags of their favourite celebrities’ choice of cosmetics.

A quarter admitted they would happily spend up to £80 on a single luxury product their beauty idol had bought, and a further 6 per cent declared they would spend up to an eye-watering £200.

On average the survey found that women 
would spend £312 a year attempting to recreate Cole and other glamorous 
stars’ looks with make-up and skincare products.

The survey also exhibited the omnipresent influence of social media, with three quarters of women saying they would rush out to buy a beauty product their icon had posted about on Twitter or Instagram, or mentioned in an interview.

Furthermore, a determined 61 per cent of women would attempt to source the particular product online if it was out of stock in store.

Popular YouTube beauty vloggers such as Lisa Eldridge and Tanya Burr have also profited from women’s desire to emulate the likes of Cheryl Cole.

Half of women (49 per cent) confessed they would try to replicate their celebrity idol’s make-up looks for a date or a night out by following YouTube ‘get the look’ tutorials like Eldridge’s, whose ‘Get The Cheryl Cole Look’ video has accumulated over 700,000 views.

Only 20 per cent of women claimed they would not purchase beauty products upon a celebrity’s recommendation.

Beauty Editor of Escentual.com, who conducted the survey, Emma Leslie said: ‘Women have forever been eager to discover the secrets of their beauty icons, so when a popular celebrity recommends a product via social media or in an interview we always see a frenzy in demand on the website.'

‘It’s not surprising that Cheryl Cole was voted the nation’s top beauty icon,' she added.

'As well as always looking flawless, she’s never afraid to experiment when it comes to make-up and pulls off a wide variety of looks with aplomb.'

The majority of women deemed ex-glamour model Jodie Marsh to be the celebrity with the worst beauty look, followed by unlucky-in-love Katie Price.
