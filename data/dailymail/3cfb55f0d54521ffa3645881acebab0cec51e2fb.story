The first two-footed challenge went in from Jose Mourinho when he claimed Paris Saint-Germain’s kickers were a refined version of Shrewsbury Town.

It was a razor-sharp comment, designed to rile the French champions and put down a marker for Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers ahead of the second leg. Sometimes this stuff bites you on the backside.

Mourinho will be picking the bones out of this for days because they were beaten at their own petty game by the perseverance of this PSG team.

There was a minor victory for Chelsea, with the foul count showing that Mourinho’s team had committed 24 to the visitors’ 17 at the end of 120 chaotic minutes here at Stamford Bridge. The reality is that they were beaten at their own game.

For PSG to do it with 10 men in extra-time, after the ludicrous dismissal of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the 32nd minute, is an even mightier achievement. The PSG striker pointed at his battle scars as he left the pitch, well aware that the reaction of Chelsea’s players to the collision with Oscar had helped Kuipers with the decision.

‘I spoke to him and he told me he didn’t mean it,’ admitted Mourinho. The pair are close from his time at Inter.

After surrounding Kuipers, Chelsea’s players called for the physio and team doctor to sprint on to tend to the stricken Oscar. Predictably, within minutes, he was back on his feet.

It is to Ibrahimovic’s credit that he left the field with dignity and composure, walking towards the tunnel and ignoring the clamour from the stands for a reaction.

‘When the red card happened, the worst thing was the Chelsea players — I felt there were 11 babies around me,’ admitted an understandably aggrieved Ibrahimovic.

It was a brutal but fair assessment of the moment that could easily have turned this tie in Chelsea’s favour.

There were feuds everywhere: David Luiz versus Diego Costa, Chelsea’s substitute keeper Petr Cech versus PSG midfielder Marco Verratti, Verratti against the world.

At every turn, someone, somewhere on the field at Stamford Bridge was rowing with somebody.

Costa could start a fight in an empty phone box, never mind an 18-yard box, gnawing away at everyone and everything during an ill-disciplined performance up top for Chelsea. This guy is really stewing at the minute.

He has gone a season without scoring in the Champions League and will have to wait until September to get going again in this competition. Luiz got inside his head, jabbering away at him in their native Brazilian-Portuguese tongue in an attempt to destabilise the forward. Costa, as we know, has only mastered one language. The Chelsea striker should have been sent off here — several times, as it happens — for his innumerable transgressions. He really is an angry man.

In the same motion he could have been booked and sent off when he caught Maxwell from behind close to the touchline of the East Stand and then appeared to accept the challenge from Luiz to graze his forehead. He escaped with a yellow card.

There was another escape, this time when he shoved over the excellent Marquinhos in a fit of pique. Quite how he survived is a story in itself.

He lives life on the edge, claiming he had been elbowed by Luiz in a hit-and-run job. It was an off-the-ball incident, retribution by the former Chelsea defender after he had collided with the pugnacious forward earlier in the first half.

He was throwing punches a few moments later, hitting the ground repeatedly after he was denied a clear penalty when Edinson Cavani took him out as he made his way into the area.

These are the fine lines of European football, with every challenge, skirmish and wrangle potentially punishable with an on-the-spot sanction from these notoriously pernickity officials.

Mourinho convinced us that Blanc had put the French champions on a diet of raw meat ahead of this second leg. This will eat away at him for months to come.

‘I need to go away and think about how this happened,’ admitted Mourinho.

Perhaps next time, he should keep both feet on the floor.
