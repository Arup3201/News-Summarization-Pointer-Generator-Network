Clive Palmer has come under fire for 'racist' comments about Chinese people, which Liberal politicians say could hurt Australia's trade relationship with China.

Clive Palmer launched the bizarre attack while appearing on Q&A on Monday night, calling Chinese people 'bastards' and 'mongrels' who 'shoot their own people'.

The Palmer United Party leader defended his comments this morning, writing on Twitter: 'My #qanda comments not intended to refer to Chinese people but to Chinese company which is taking Australian resources & not paying'.

But one important voice has been missing from the debate.

Missing in action: Clive Palmer's Chinese-born senator Dio Wang has kept mum on the whole dispute.

Australia's Palmer United Party leader was on the panel of ABC television programme Q&A on Monday night when he hit out with the racist comments

Chinese-born PUP Senator Dio Wang has kept mum despite today's furore.

When Daily Mail Australia called the Senator Wang's office this afternoon, a spokeswoman said Mr Wang was 'in a meeting' and therefore unavailable to comment.

The senator was still in a meeting when the Mail called back 20 minutes later. 'He is in a meeting (for) the whole day,' the spokeswoman said.

'He doesn't have time to respond to this'.

Cabinet ministers have condemned Mr Palmer's comments, with Treasurer Joe Hockey saying they were 'hugely damaging'.

'I would say to Clive Palmer please do not bring down the rest of Australia because of your bias,' he said. Mr Hockey added that Mr Palmer was himself the beneficiary of Chinese investment.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop reiterated that Australia's relationship with China was 'very important'.

'I will contact the embassy and let them know these are the views of one member of parliament, they are not representative of the majority of parliament and certainly not the majority of Australian people.

'It really isn't appropriate for [Mr Palmer] to vent on a national television programme about his bitterness about a legal dispute he’s having with a Chinese company,' she told 3AW Radio.

Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce remarked this morning that Palmer's remarks were 'not helpful' and could be harmful to Australia's business relationship with China.

'Clive started with a company called China First. He wanted to make a lot of money out of dealing with China. You can't blame the Chinese for being tough business people. That's what business is about. But the emotive and colourful language is not the way that you do business,' Mr Joyce said on ABC News Breakfast.

There has been no word from the Palmer United Party's Chinese born Senator Dio Wang, who represents Western Australia.

Clive Palmer's comments come as he is locked in a legal battle with Chinese-owned Citic Pacific over a series of disputes.

The first concerns a bank account operated by Mr Palmer's company Mineralogy, for which Mr Palmer was the only signatory of the account at the time of the incident.

Citic claims that the account was only to be used for covering the operational costs of Port Preston, an iron ore port in Western Australia.

Two cheques were spent from this account in 2013, one for $10 million that went to Mr Palmer's Cosmo Development and a $2.17 million check that went to the PR firm Media Circus.

Citic has accused Mr Palmer of using the $12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013.

On Monday's episode of Q&A Tony Jones tried to get Mr Palmer to admit whether or not he had spent any money from the Mineralogy-operated account on his election campaign.

One of Mr Palmer's companies, Queensland Nickel, put $12.7 million back into the account after media accounts of the incident first emerged.

There is an ongoing dispute between Palmer's Mineralogy and Citic about the Sino Iron Project. The dispute concerns royalties for the project, with Mr Palmer claiming he is owed $500 million.

Even former One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, who said in her maiden address to Parliament in 1996 that Australia was in danger of being 'swamped by Asians', condemned his comments, saying he should 'stick [his] nose out of other people's business'.

'Maybe Clive Palmer should take a position over in China in Parliamentary seats. I’ve always said clean up your own backyard before criticising other people. It’s not up to Clive Palmer or anyone else. It’s not for us or Australia to get involved in that,' she told Sunrise.

Mr Palmer was on the panel of the ABC's flagship programme when he launched into a tirade about Chinese business interests in Australia, accusing Chinese people of trying to take over Australia

'The Chinese government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free. So far they've shifted $200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it. I don't mind standing up against the Chinese bastards and stop them from doing it,' he said.

The controversial MP made the comments when he was being questioned by host Tony Jones about allegations he used money from one of his business accounts to fund his election campaign.

Mr Palmer repeatedly refused to answer Mr Jones's questions, saying he would be answering them in court this week and would not be subjected to a 'trial by media'.

He then claimed he was owed 'about $500 million by the Communist Chinese government.'

'We'll be suing them and they'll be answering the questions. We've had... an arbitration against these Chinese mongrels - I'm saying that because they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we're not going to let them,' he said.

Outraged Q&A viewers took to social media and expressed their disgusts over the mining billionaire's derogatory views.

Activist group GetUp! tweeted: 'Hey, that was pretty racist @CliveFPalmer, and that's not okay'.

'To say what Clive Palmer just said on #qanda. I'm surprised if that's legal. Or free speech absolute in Oz?' Peter Johansson tweeted.

'I love how @clivefpalmer is celebrating Australia's cultural diversity in an anger racist Palmer kind of way,' Raphael tweeted.

Silas Palmer wrote: 'Was that [the snarling, racist and ruthless] the Real Clive Palmer'.

'Dear @JulieBishopMP , If you need help with your portfolio perhaps @CliveFPalmer may help with a diplomatic mission to China,' tweeted Viscount Mike OBE.

Some expressed support for Mr Palmer, with Raiderette tweeting: 'Good on ya Clive keep speaking freely!' and Michael Brown writing: 'Fair enough Clive.'

The 56-year-old is a mining billionaire and established the Palmer United Party last year

The 56-year-old was on the panel for the weekly Australian talk show hosted by Tony Jones.

Other panellists were deputy prime minister Warren Truss, opposition leader in the senate Penny Wong, businesswoman and RBA board member Heather Ridout, national CEO of St Vincent de Paul Society John Falzon.

In 2009, Clive Palmer criticised the Labor government's trade policies, which made trade more difficult for Chinese investors than U.S. investors.

In an address to the Queensland Media Club he called the current policies 'racist' and said there was 'a great cry in Australia about Reds under the bed'.

But Mr Palmer argued that 'capital is now in China, it's not in the US' and that Australia had a terrific opportunity to become a strong trade partner with China 'if our politicians could only be fair and treat the Chinese people and Chinese government with the dignity they deserve.'
