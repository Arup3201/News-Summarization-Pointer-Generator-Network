A family were shocked when they unwrapped a Hovis loaf which had both white and brown bread.

Mother-of-four Susie Hirschler, 58, bought the £1.35 medium white sliced loaf during her weekly shop at a Tesco store near her home in Crawley, West Sussex.

But when she got home she found each slice was white on the top half and brown on the bottom.

Daughter Isabella, 17, was first to find the bizarre bread when she opened the wrapper to make toast. She buttered a slice - and found it tasted odd.

Her sister Madeleine, 21, said: ‘Isabella said it tasted strange so I had a piece and it tasted horrible.

‘There was sticky stuff in the middle as though someone had glued both pieces together. It definitely was not white bread as it said on the packet.

'It was certainly something we had never seen before. Mum took the loaf back to Tesco and they said they'd send it off to Hovis but we've kept a couple of slices in the freezer.’

A Hovis spokesman said: ‘This loaf has been combined with a piece of dough from the previous mix. We want to assure the customer that the greatest care is exercised during the baking process to help prevent such occurrences. We will make our production staff aware of this occurrence to help minimise the chances of it happening again.’

Since 2001 Hovis has stocked a Best of Both 'white and brown' brand - billed as 'tasty white bread with all the wheatgerm goodness of wholemeal'.
