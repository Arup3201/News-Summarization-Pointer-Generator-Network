The look on her face said it all when the barista fled for her life after being held hostage in her own workplace at Lindt cafe in Sydney for seven unbearable hours.

Elly Chen has received an outpouring of love and relieved wishes from her friends on her Facebook page once the images of her escape went viral around the world.

Still wearing her brown Lindt apron - Ms Chen escaped through the front door of the cafe - undoubtedly the longest and most frightening seconds of her entire life.

Ms Chen was the fourth of five lucky hostages who have escaped from the armed gunman who stormed the cafe at 9.45am on Monday - locking in every unlucky staff member and customer who happened to be inside the chocolate cafe at the time.

The images of Ms Chen literally running for her life will be etched in people's mind's for some time to come - and a moment she is unlikely to ever erase from her memory.

While Thomas Ng said: 'Heard on news just now - Glad you're safe, it must have been an insane time you gone through. Praying for peace.'

The overwhelming relief was expressed in every post she received on her page. 

'My goodness...I'm so glad you're safe,' Sherilyn Chen, possibly a relative said.
