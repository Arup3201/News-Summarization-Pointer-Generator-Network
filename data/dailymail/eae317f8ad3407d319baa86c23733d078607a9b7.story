Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella apologized on Thursday night and said he was wrong for saying that women don't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well.

Nadella was blasted on Twitter and in blog posts for his comments, which were made earlier on Thursday at an event for women in computing.

He had been asked to give his advice to women who are uncomfortable requesting a raise. His response: 'It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along.' 

Not asking for raise, he added, is 'good karma' that would help a boss realize that the employee could be trusted and should have more responsibility.

Foot in mouth disease: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sparked a controversy by advising women against asking for raises 

But his comments caused an uproar online, and Microsoft posted a memo from him on its website. 

In it, Nadella said he answered the question 'completely wrong' and that he thinks 'men and women should get equal pay for equal work. 

And when it comes to career advice on getting a raise when you think it's deserved, Maria's advice was the right advice. If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask.'

His interviewer at the event, Maria Klawe, president of Harvey Mudd College and a Microsoft director, had told him she disagreed, which drew cheers from the audience. 

She suggested women do their homework on salary information and first practice asking with people they trust.

Still, his comments at the event, the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, underscored why many see technology companies as workplaces that are difficult to navigate or even unfriendly for women and minorities. 

Tech companies, particularly the engineering ranks, are overwhelmingly male, white and Asian.

Criticized for their lack of diversity, major companies say they are trying to address the problem with programs such as employee training sessions and by participating in initiatives meant to introduce girls to coding.

Twenty-nine percent of Microsoft's employees are women, according to figures the Redmond, Washington-based company released earlier this month. Its technical and engineering staff and its management are just 17 percent female.

That's roughly comparable to diversity data released by other big tech companies this year.

'Without a doubt I wholeheartedly support programs at Microsoft and in the industry that bring more women into technology and close the pay gap,' Nadella wrote in his memo to employees. 

The gaffe came towards the end of a Q & A session conducted by Maria Klawe, a member of Microsoft's board of directors, who asked Nadella for an advice for women who are not comfortable asking for a raise. 

'It's not really about asking for a raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will give you the right raise,' he responded, reportedly sending murmurs of indignation through a crowd of 500 women sitting in the audience.

'That might be one of the initial 'super powers' that, quite frankly, women [who] don't ask for a raise have,' he continued. 'It's good karma. It will come back.'

Klawe disagreed with Nadella's career advice, urging women to be tough negotiators when it comes to asking for compensation.

To emphasize her point, Klawe, a well-regarded computer scientist, told the audience how she settled for a salary $50,000 lower than she had deemed appropriate when she was offered the position of dean of engineering at Princeton University, Bloomberg reported.

Satya Nadella did not have to wait long for a reaction to his words of wisdom as Twitter lit up with highly critical posts.

Backtrack: Nadella quickly took to Twitter to apologize for his 'tone-deaf' remarks 

'That @satyanadella thought that was reasonable advice says volumes about how little @Microsoft understands and wants to solve the problem,' wrote Sarah Milstein, CEO of Lean Startups Productions.

Alahha Woods tweeted at Nadella: 'This can't be positively spun.'

The recently appointed CEO of Microsoft quickly went into damage control mode Thursday afternoon, tweeting to his followers: 'was inarticulate re how women should ask for raise. Our industry must close gender pay gap so a raise is not needed because of a bias.'

He then followed up by releasing the text of a company-wide email addressing his gaffe, in which he readily admitted that he answered Maria Klawe's question about raises 'completely wrong.'

'I believe men and women should get equal pay for equal work. And when it comes to career advice on getting a raise when you think it's deserved, Maria's advice was the right advice.

'If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask.'

Nadella's controversial and arguably tone-deaf remarks come a week after Microsoft released figures showing that the company's staff was about 29 per cent female, and that 17 per cent of employees occupying position of leadership within the company were women.
