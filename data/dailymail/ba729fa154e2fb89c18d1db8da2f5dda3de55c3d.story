A missing baby has been found safe and well after her disappearance sparked an enormous police manhunt.  

Lana-Mai Bates, who is nine weeks old, was reported missing by her mother in the early hours of yesterday morning.  

She was handed over to police 14 hours later after officers were called to an address near her home in the Pleck area of Walsall, West Midlands.  

Found: Lana-Mai Bates was handed over to police yesterday afternoon following a 14-hour manhunt 

Safe: The nine-week-old baby was unharmed after going missing and being found by police 

Her father Stuart Adams, 30, was arrested on suspicion of child abduction following a short chase by officers.  

Lana-Mai was taken to Walsall's Manor Hospital, where doctors confirmed that she was unharmed.

The girl's mother contacted police after Adams apparently failed to return her to her home on time. 

Officers launched a hunt for both Lana-Mai and her father, searching a number of addresses linked to him.  

Arrest: After Lana-Mai was found safe and well, her father Stuart Adams, right, was arrested 

Concern: The baby girl was reported missing by her mother in the early hours of yesterday morning 

They were unable to find them until yesterday afternoon, when a woman at a house on Lana-Mai's street handed her over to police.  

Chief Supt Dave Sturman, Commander of Walsall, said: 'We would like to thank the people of Walsall and beyond for their help in this fast-moving inquiry.  

'I am relieved and pleased to be able to say that Lana-Mai is safe and well. Thank you to everyone who helped share our appeal.'  

Hunt: Police trawled the Pleck area of Walsall for 14 hours after Lana-Mai was reported missing

Safety: Lana-Mai was handed to police after a huge hunt and appeal. Pictured are police investigating her disappearance

Operation: Police are pictured entering a house in the area and leaving with the baby

A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It was a very strange turn of events for the baby to turn up here.  

'I saw them take her away and she looked OK.  

'I think everyone is just glad she was found. You hear terrible stories so when I heard she was missing I was worried. Thank God she's OK.'
