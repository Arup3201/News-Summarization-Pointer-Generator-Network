Moving against tax avoidance
by corporations, the Obama administration took several actions
on Monday to curb  'inversion' deals that allow companies to
escape high U.S. taxes by reincorporating abroad.

The Treasury Department announced new rules, effective
immediately, that will reduce the tax benefits available to
companies that have inverted, while also making new inversions
more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding.

Because they took effect on Monday, the new rules might
raise issues for some of a handful of companies that have 
agreed to do inversions, but have not yet completed them.

Fast-food chain Burger King Worldwide Inc is in the
midst of inverting to Canada in a deal with coffee-and-donuts
vendor Tim Hortons Inc. A spokeswoman for Burger King
said the company declined to comment.

Asked about the impact on pending deals, a senior Treasury
official told reporters on a conference call: 'If they are
closed and done as of today, then they are not subject to this.
If they are closed tomorrow or after, they are subject to this.'

U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is the driving force behind a new policy that penalizes companies for avoiding tax es by merging with overseas companies -- a scheme known as a corporate inversion

President Barack Obama, who has sharply criticized inverting
companies, said the Treasury Department's steps would
'discourage companies from taking advantage of corporate
inversions - moving their tax residence overseas on paper to
avoid paying their fair share in taxes here at home.'

The announcement of the rules followed months of growing
concern on Capitol Hill, with Democrats urging prompt
legislative action and Republicans pushing to address the
problem later, perhaps in 2015, as part of a broader overhaul of
the loophole-riddled federal tax code.

Companies that do inversions, which are legal and already
subject to certain restrictions, say they are only trying to
minimize their tax bills, which investors expect.

About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s,
but half of those have been completed just since the 2008-2009
credit crisis, according to a Reuters review.

Inversions have surged in the past year, pursued by big
companies such as Burger King and medical technology group
Medtronic Inc, which is working to close an inversion
deal into Ireland with rival Covidien Plc.

Medtronic spokesman Fernando Vivanco late on Monday told
Reuters: 'We are studying Treasury's actions. We will release
our perspective on any potential impact on our pending
acquisition of Covidien following our complete review.'

Medtronic has said it expects to close the Covidien
acquisition by the end of this year or early 2015.

Inversions usually involve a U.S. corporation buying a
smaller, foreign rival and redomiciling in its home country,
where taxes are lower, even though core operations typically
remain in the United States.

Treasury Secretary Lew said in a statement: 'These first,
targeted steps make substantial progress in constraining the
creative techniques used to avoid U.S. taxes, both in terms of
meaningfully reducing the economic benefits of inversions after
the fact, and when possible, stopping them altogether.'

A key target of Treasury's actions is foreign profits held
offshore by U.S. multinationals under a U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) rule that defers taxation on such profits unless
and until they are brought into the United States.

Deal: Fast-food chain Burger King Worldwide Inc is in the midst of inverting to Canada in a deal with coffee-and-donutsvendor Tim Hortons Inc.

One new Treasury rule will prevent inverted companies from
using 'hopscotch' loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes
when tapping such tax-deferred foreign profits. Another rule
will bar inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of
profits by using 'decontrolling' strategies that restructure
foreign units so they are no longer U.S.-controlled.

Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of
ownership that the former U.S. owners can have in an inverted
company to qualify for foreign tax treatment from the IRS, a
move that will make it harder to do these deals.

Some companies had feared that new rules might be imposed
retroactively, but they were not.

Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac
Research Group, said the administration 'may succeed in chilling
the climate for further deals, but this was not as strident as
it could have been, especially in that they don't do anything
retroactively.' 

The rules were the administration's latest effort to tackle
what it sees as a pressing issue by taking executive actions
that side-step a gridlocked Congress.

'When corporations choose to invert and don't pay their fair
share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab,'
said Democratic Senator Dick Durbin in a statement.

'Today, the Obama administration put these corporate tax
deserters on notice: we are not going to stand by while they
game the tax code and avoid their responsibility to our
country,' Durbin said.

Though in disagreement about the issue's urgency, both
Democrats and Republicans have said inversions are a symptom of
a broken tax code that needs a thorough overhaul, a job that has
eluded Congress and successive presidents since 1986.

Senator Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the tax
law-writing Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement: 'In
the end, any solution that permanently addresses inversions must
be legislated by Congress.'
