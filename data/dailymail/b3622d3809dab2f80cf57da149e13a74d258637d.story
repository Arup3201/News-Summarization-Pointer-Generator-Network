Gerard Deulofeu admits he is relishing the opportunity to prove himself at Barcelona after returning to the club after his loan spell with Everton.

The Spanish starlet spent a productive season at Goodison Park but he has now graduated from Barca's B team after the appointment of Luis Enrique as manager.

Toffees boss Roberto Martinez had hoped to keep the 20-year-old next season, but Enrique is keen to promote young talent from the club's famous La Masia academy.

Deulofeu will battle with the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Pedro for a place in Enrique's starting XI, but he is not afraid of the challange awaiting him at the Nou Camp.

Speaking to the club's official website, Deulofeu said: 'I’m very happy, I’ve missed all of this.

'I know how much competition there is for places here, but I think that’s a good thing. I know what kind of football I can offer and I’ll do my best to help.

'I want to win trophies and contribute as much as I can.'

Fellow midfielder Rafinha has also returned to his parent club after spending last season on loan at Celta Vigo under the management of Enrique.

The 21-year-old, who is the brother of Bayern Munich and Spain star Thiago Alcantara, added: 'I learned the game for seven years here and I’m thrilled to be back, it’s a great challenge for me.

'I want to learn from these brilliant players.'
