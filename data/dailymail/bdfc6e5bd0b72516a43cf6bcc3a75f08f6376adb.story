Joe France, pictured with his mother Kelly Jones, had been looking forward to seeing The Theory of Everything due to his love of Stephen Hawking

A 12-year-old boy with cerebral palsy could not see a film about Stephen Hawking because there was no wheelchair access to his local cinema.

Science lover Joe France had been eagerly awaiting the release of The Theory Of Everything because he looks up to Stephen Hawking, the world-famous physicist who himself uses a wheelchair.

But despite it being National Disabled Access Day last Saturday, the Odeon Cinema in Joe's home town of Harrogate, North Yorkshire told him the film wasn't being shown on the any of the screens he can access.

Joe's mother, Kelly Jones, told how her son has always used a wheelchair and is very likely to need one for the rest of his life.

She says she was left stunned when she phoned up their local cinema last Saturday to check he'd be able to see the film, but was told it was not possible.

The mother-of-five said: 'It was ironic as it was National Disabled Access Day, and we were going to see a film about the most famous disabled person in the world and they had no disabled access.

'Joe was just left confused by the whole thing, he couldn't understand why they couldn't show it for him in another screen.

'He said to me; 'The film was supposed to inspire people but how can can somebody in a wheelchair be inspired if they can't see it?'

'I cried when he said that, it's just such a good way of looking at it. I have always told Joe you can get anything you want in life but you just have to do it a little bit differently to get the goal.

'Look at Stephen Hawking - he was told he only had a couple of years to live and look where he is now.

'He was so disappointed not to see the film. Last night he watched the trailer about six times.'

IT recruitment consultant Ms Jones said when she asked staff at her local Odeon if they could move one of the showings to a disabled access screen on Saturday or Sunday, she was told head office decide what films are shown in what screens and there was nothing to be done.

But when Ms Jones phoned Odeon cinema in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, she was told the film would not be shown on any of the screens her son could access

Although Ms Jones, 36, couldn't fault the manner she was treated - she said the staff member she spoke to was very polite - she did think the Odeon could have done more to help her and her son.

The single mother added: 'Joe has been waiting to see this film since it came out on New Year's Day but I told him we should wait a couple of weeks to make sure we can get in.

'He is really into science, physics and into space. He has got a telescope and wants to be astronomer.

Joe is a keen scientist and lists Stephen Hawking among his 'top three heroes'

'He wanted to see the film because of the science but and also because Stephen Hawking wasn't always in a wheelchair, which really interests him.'

Schoolboy Joe said: 'I felt a bit disappointed really, I was looking forward to seeing the film, Stephen Hawking is one of my top three heroes.

'I am very interested in time, space, physics and black hole theory. I would like to study sciences at college and maybe be an astronomer, or a geography teacher or a science teacher.

'I thought it was going to be a very special day but I ended up doing nothing. It would be good to see more lifts in buildings to give disabled people access.'

Since the incident Odeon have contacted Ms Kelly and offered her free tickets to a showing this Friday, but Ms Kelly said they won't be returning to the cinema.

Jason Stanton, Head of Guest Experience at Odeon, said: 'Odeon Harrogate is inside a listed building, so we are unfortunately unable to change its layout to add wheelchair access to the two screens that currently don't have it.

'We therefore try to rotate weekly the films we show in the three screens that do have access for people with disabilities, to ensure a full range of films is available.

'The Theory of Everything was shown in a screen with wheelchair access during the week of January 9 - 15 and we'll be showing it again in a wheelchair-accessible screen for another week from this Friday January 23.

'On the weekend of the January 17-18, newer release films American Sniper, Into the Woods and Taken 3 were shown in the screens with access for people with disabilities, to ensure a variety of films are on offer.

Mr Stanton added: 'Unfortunately, this wasn't communicated to the guest clearly and we apologise for the frustration this caused.

'We have invited them back to see The Theory of Everything as guests of the cinema, and they have assured us they are satisfied with how the matter was concluded.

'We have a proud history of working with the Cinema Exhibitor's Association (CEA) to fundraise for charities that support people with disabilities such as Variety, the children's charity - and to champion equality in cinemas for all.

'Odeon is also proud to be a part of the CEA Card scheme, a national concessionary card to allow people with disabilities to obtain free cinema tickets for people accompanying them.

'The vast majority of our screens are accessible to wheelchair users, and we have been at the forefront of introducing other initiatives for guests with disabilities including providing headsets for visually impaired guests, and hosting Audio Descriptive Screenings and Autism Friendly Screenings.'

A spokesperson for Disabled Access Day said: 'This shows that while there has been much progress, there is still a great deal that needs to be done in the area of accessibility and illustrates how important it is to so many people's lives. Often access is about exploring creative solutions and greater understanding.'
