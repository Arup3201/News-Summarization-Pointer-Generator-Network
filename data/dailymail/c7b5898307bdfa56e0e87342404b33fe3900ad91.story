Any pending legal appeals will not delay the execution of the Bali Nine duo and the eight other drug smuggles, the Indonesian Attorney General has confirmed.

This comes as Bali's chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso announced Australian death row inmates Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be moved to 'Death Island' where they will be executed this week.

HM Prasetyo also confirmed that the preparations for the mass death by firing squad were '95 per cent' ready as Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers are planning to lodge an appeal within the next week.

Final journey: The strain shows on the faces of Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right), pictured in Kerobokan prison this week in Kerobokan prison with Indonesia's human rights commissioner Natalius Pigai (centre) who can do nothing to save them from execution which now seems set for this weekend

In waiting: Seen from the waters off Nuskambangan in central Java this is the police station on the 30km long island which houses seven prisons, including Batu or 'stone' prison where special isolation cells have been prepared for the Australian Bali 9 duo ahead of the deaths by firing squad

However, HM Prasetyo said following the clemency plea rejection there were no more 'no more legal avenues left', The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

'Regarding the transfer (of Chan and Sukumaran), it will be done as soon as possible,' he said. 

'It's all related to technical issues. Maybe there are still some things that need to be prepared.

As an Indonesian battleship is due to arrive in the waters off Nusakambangan island in southern central Java, Mr Samiarso said that for the first time Attorney General M. Prasetyo had issued him with an order to to move the Bali Nine duo to the island.

He said a meeting would take place on Monday to set the date of the transfer. Before they depart, Chan and Sukumaran will take part in a Hindu ceremony at Kerobokan prison in Bali at which offerings of flowers and food will be given and prayers will be made asking for the blessing of the gods.

Grisly business: Dressed in civvies to play their roles as Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, two police officers from Indonesia's mobile brigade take part in a dress rehearsal for the men's removal to Nusakambangan island for their execution along with eight other drug traffickers

The two Australians have a 900km journey from Bali where they have lived for the last decade, west to the port town of Cilacap from where they will be transferred to the prison island and place of their execution, Nusakambangan

This comes as gruesome details of the planned executions comes to light. The two Australians and eight others will be executed in similar fashion to five foreigners and an Indonesian woman killed by firing squad on the island on January 18.

Four of the  prisoners were strapped to wooden planks with a type of rubber used to make the inside of car tyres.

Indonesian Rani Andriani aka Melisa Aprilia, opted not to be attached to a board, saying in a written submission beforehand 'submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'. 

Last rites: Kerobokan prison (pictured, this week) will hold a special Hindu ceremony for Chan and Sukumaran asking the gods to bless the men before they make their final journey to their deaths

Is all hope lost? Bali's chief prosecutor says he is now certain that Myuran Sukumaran (above, left) and Andrew Chan (right) will be moved from Bali to Nusakambangan Island this week to be out to the firing squad

A masked member of the mobile paramilitary brigade 'Brimob' armed with an assault rifle will be among 22 officers who will accompany Chan and Sukumaran from Kerobokan prison to Denpasar airport, which they last saw ten years ago on arrival for their ill-fated heroin smuggling trip

These armed personnel carriers belonging to the Indonesian special police will be used in the transfer of the two Australians to Bali's airport whereupon they will be placed in Sukhoi jets and likely flown straight to Cilacap, which is just a short trip to their place of execution, Nusakambangan

Another woman, Vietnamese Tran Thi Bich Hanh who was executed on the same night but at Boyolali on the mainland in central Java, said in a final submission, 'whenever God wants me to die I am ready'.

News emerging from Cilacap, the nearest port to Nuskambangan island, is that the town is filling up with Indonesian Navy special forces.

Mr Samiarso said Nuskambangan, which houses seven prisons amid thick rain forest on the 30km long island, was now ready to receive Chan and Sukumaran.

'Everything is ready,' he said, reports Nine news, 'it will be this week for sure.'

Indonesian police carry out an ant-terrorist drill at Pasir Putih prison, the 'supermax' of Nuskambangan's seven correctional facilities on the island where Chan and Sukumaran are due to be shot this week

After weeks of deadly anticipation it appears that Nusakambangan, where police were pictured (above) this week taking part in an anti-terrorist drill is finally ready to carry out the deaths by firing squad of ten drug traffickers including the Australians Chan and Sukumaran

Indonesia plans to  hold the Australians and eight other convicted drug traffickers in one of the island's prisons before they are simultaneously killed by firing squads in the middle of the night.

The prisons boss for Central java provence, Ahmad Yuspahruddin,confirmed last week that special isolation cells had been prepared for the Australian pair or Batu, or 'stone' prison away from the jail's other inmates weho weren't on death row.

The transfer of Chan and Sukumaran to Nusakambangan, which had been predicted more than a week ago, was delayed by the logistics of carrying out the execution of ten people at once.

Myuran Sukumaran pictured in 2006 just after the death sentence had been passed on him and Andrew Chan, less than a year after the pair and the seven drug mules they consigned to carry 8.3kg of heroin into Australia had been caught and jailed

The men spent time with family members, although Sukumaran's father, Sam and siblings, brother Chinthu and sister Brinthe returned to Australia on Sunday.

Last Friday, Indonesia's mobile paramilitary brigade, Brimob, who will carry out the executions, staged a dress rehearsal in Bali to demonstrate how the Australian drug smugglers will be transferred from Kerobokan jail to the execution island.

In the exercise, 22 heavily-armed officers clad in balaclavas took the 'prisoners', played by two police officers, on and off a military plane, represented by a bus.

If Mr Samiarso's statement is correct, pleas for clemency by Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop and, in a phone call directly to Indonesian president Joko Widowo, Prime Minister Tony Abbott, havefallen on deaf ears.

Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 34, were the leaders of an 8.3kg heroin trafficking ring dubbed the 'Bali 9' who were convicted of attempting to smuggle the drugs out of Indonesia to Australia in 2005.

They were sentenced to death in February 2006 and have been living in Kerobokan prison.

The other eight due to face the firing squad are: Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, Serge Areski Atlaoui of France, Martin Anderson of Ghana, Indonesian Zainal Abidin, Silvester Obikwe of Nigeria and Rodrigo Gularte, a paranoid schizophrenic man from Brazil whose family has desperately fought to be transferred to a hospital.
