A new gel containing an ingredient previously used in eye drops could be the solution to embarrassing and often painful facial flushing.

Mirvaso will be available on prescription only for patients with the skin condition rosacea, which causes blushing and also permanent redness.

The gel contains brimonidine, a drug used to treat the eye disease glaucoma. The new use for  it was discovered by accident when patients with both conditions found that their skin around the eyes became clear when they used the drops.

Skin aid: The new gel, Mirvaso, will help patients with the skin condition rosacea, which causes blushing and also permanent redness

Rosacea is a genetic condition that affects about one in ten people in the UK. Usually appearing in people from their mid-30s onwards, it causes blood vessels in the face to dilate, leading to redness and uncontrollable flushing. The condition can be triggered by sunlight, saunas, spicy food, alcohol or stress.

In severe cases, rosacea can cause acne-like pustules on the face and can even thicken and distort the skin of the nose.

Although Mirvaso is not a cure, it causes the vessels to contract and become less visible for about 12 hours.

Dr Anthony Bewley, consultant dermatologist at Bart’s Health NHS Trust in London, recently conducted UK trials on Mirvaso. He found patients responded well to the treatment.

‘Rosacea sufferers often find the facial redness very disfiguring and even disabling,’ he says. ‘The flushing can appear at the most inopportune times, such as when people are at a job interview or are trying to impress someone.

‘Patients often also suffer a burning sensation at the same time. It makes them feel wretched and out of control. Some become depressed and a few even feel suicidal.

‘Until now there hasn’t been much that effectively treated the redness and flushing. Even  if patients have expensive laser treatments, the redness tends to come back. To have this is helpful not just for my patients’ skin, but their self-worth too.’

Mirvaso was cleared by the  US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2013 and by European regulators last week, meaning it can now be introduced in the UK.

Dr Bewley says he found that Mirvaso cleared redness within a few minutes in some patients.

And studies conducted by Galderma, which manufactures Mirvaso, suggest it may be effective at reducing visible redness  in about 70 per cent of patients.

Between one and four per cent of users can have side effects, including, ironically, rebound redness and skin irritation.

If Mirvaso is applied patchily, the face will have red areas where the cream was missed.

Dermatologist Dr Nick Lowe,  of the Cranley Clinic in London, says: ‘I have been interested in brimonidine for some time now, and think Mirvaso is going to  be very helpful when treating rosacea. It can be used in conjunction with other medications such as antibiotics and lasers. However, some of my patients who have used it say they have experienced stinging and increased redness.’

Despite these issues, some desperate patients are already buying Mirvaso over the internet from the US. Dr Lowe and Dr Bewley say they will be keen to consider prescribing Mirvaso to patients when it becomes available next month.

Health trusts will now have  to decide whether to offer it to patients in their area – it is expected to cost the NHS as little as 50p a day per patient.

Mirvaso will be also be available privately. A 30g tube that lasts between 30 and 60 days should cost less than £35.
