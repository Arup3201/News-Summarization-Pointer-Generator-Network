Tragic: Nicky Payne was rushed to hospital after collapsing during a rounders game

A 14-year-old girl died after collapsing at school while playing rounders in a PE lesson.

Nicola Payne had been playing the game with her friends at Angley School in Cranbrook, Kent, when the tragedy happened yesterday morning.

Nicola, known as Nicky to her family and friends, was given first aid at the scene while staff ushered other upset pupils away.

A 999 call was made at around 11.30am, and an ambulance crew, who found Nicky in full cardiac arrest, tried to help the schoolgirl at the scene.

She was taken to William Harvey Hospital in nearby Ashford but was later pronounced dead.

Nicky lived with her mother Roz, 49, father Bill, 52, an HGV driver, non-identical twin sister and a 17-year-old sister in Tonbridge, Kent.

Her cousin Sarah Hutchinson, 32, who used to baby sit the schoolgirl and her sisters today described her as a 'beautiful, sensitive girl'.

She said: 'She was my little cousin Nick. We got on very well. She was a bridesmaid at my wedding last year.

'She loved singing and dancing and anything which allowed her to be creative. I was often treated to performances by Nicky and her sisters.

'She was a huge Justin Bieber fan as most teenage girls are.

'Nicky and Charlotte were very close. They were in all the same lessons in primary school. Charlotte and Emily were very protective of Nicky. Nicky was a beautiful, sensitive girl.'

She added: 'We were unaware of any heart problems. She was a fit and healthy girl. 'We do not really know what happened.'

A Kent Police spokesman said despite the efforts of paramedics, the tragic schoolgirl could not be saved.

He said: 'Nicky was taken to hospital but medical staff were unable to revive her.

'Her death is being treated as unexplained but there are not currently thought to be any suspicious circumstances.

'Nicky's family are being supported by a family liaison officer from Kent Police and the coroner has been notified.'

The
coroner is expected to open an inquest into her death and adjourn it 
for a later date. A postmortem will try to establish the cause of her 
death.

Debbie Coslett, headteacher of Angley
School, said: 'Everyone at the school is extremely shocked and saddened
by the news of Nicky's death. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are 
with her family and friends at this very difficult time.

Friends have set up a Facebook group for Nicky, joined by more than 800 people

'Nicky
played a full part in the life of the school and was the first to 
volunteer for any activity. She especially loved taking part in school 
shows.

'It will take time for all those who knew her to come to terms with what has happened.

'We will be offering support to her friends, all students and staff at the school.
