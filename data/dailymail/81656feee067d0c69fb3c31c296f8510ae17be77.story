Radamel Falcao has not surrendered his status as one of the world’s most clinical strikers but may simply be lacking a little love and affection, says Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev.

The Colombian forward has scored just four goals during his loan spell at Manchester United and Louis van Gaal, who replaced him after an hour in the FA Cup against Preston, left him to stew on the bench against Swansea on Saturday.

United are set to decline the chance to sign the 29-year-old permanently at the end of the season but Monaco insist he is not damaged goods, just because he has not shone in the Premier League.

‘I am not worried for Falcao,’ said Vasilyev. ‘He is a great player and goal scorer. Mentally he is strong and technically he is one of the best. Sometimes you have a difficult spell, and little things make the difference. It can be the trust of the coach. 

‘Football has many examples of amazing players who go from one team to another and are not the same, then go back and explode.

‘After a difficult period you need support, you need confidence.’ Falcao’s contract ties him to Monaco until 2018 and his £280,000-a-week wage is a huge commitment from any club outside the French tax haven.

‘It is always possible he can play for Monaco again,’ said Vasilyev. ‘We have interest from other great clubs but we are waiting for the decision of Manchester United.’

Real Madrid and Valencia have been linked with a move for Falcao.
