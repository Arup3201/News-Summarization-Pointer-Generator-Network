A man has shot dead his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend after they awoke on Saturday morning to find the man standing over them with a gun.

Authorities believe the former boyfriend, who has not been named, entered the home in Birmingham, Alabama after using a key he had copied without the woman's knowledge.

The couple were sleeping in the bedroom when they woke and saw the man with a pistol inside the home on Beta Street in Titusville at 6.45am.

The new boyfriend grabbed his gun and both men started firing shots, authorities told ABC33.

When police officers arrived on the scene, they found the new boyfriend with a gunshot wound to his leg, while the other man was face down on the floor

He had been hit multiple times in his head and chest, authorities said.

Both men were rushed to hospital but the former boyfriend died as a result of his injuries.

Neighbor Jonathan Richardson said he was shocked to see a distressed woman running out of the house early on Saturday.

'I thought, at first, someone was just arguing and got into it,' he told ABC33, but then he heard a distinctive sound.

Shock: Neighbor Jonathan Richardson said he hear a 'pop, pop, pop' coming from the home and a woman running outside. The new boyfriend was also shot in the leg and is being treated in hospital

'It was a repeated sound. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop! It did not sound like a really powerful gun. It sounded like some firecrackers.' 

Lieutenant Scott Thurmond said authorities are not looking for any other suspects in the case.

'We have everybody that was involved in the situation,' he told WBRC.

'There are some witnesses that we are interviewing at this point in time. Crime scene technicians are collecting evidence and the detectives will continue to investigate.'

Police do not believe the new boyfriend will face any charges but the case is being treated as a homicide and will be presented to the District Attorney's Office for review.
