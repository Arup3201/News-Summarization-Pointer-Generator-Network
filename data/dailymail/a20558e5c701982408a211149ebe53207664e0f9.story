Downton fans were sent into a frenzy of anticipation this week, as more details about the new series were released. The forth run of the drama -  sold to over 220 territories around the world and believed to have been seen by approximately 120 million people - will begin next month.

And the millions seduced by the strait-laced but stylish world of the British historical drama will soon be able to take some of that style home.

If you want lips as soft as Lady Mary's, wine inspired by Lord Grantham's favorite tipple - or even walls the exact shade of grey as as Mrs. Patmore's kitchen, you're in luck as there is a new wave of merchandise set to hit stores.

There will be a board game, homewares, clothes, beauty products, and even Downton wine hitting stores this year

The programme's makers have arguably been slow to exploit the commercial potential of the show's popularity through merchandising, selling little more than DVD sets, wall calendars and desk diaries.

But that is all about to change.

A huge range of merchandise is being rolled out to accompany the fourth season, including a board game, homewares, clothes, beauty products, and even Downton wine - all in the best possible taste, naturally.

'We haven't rushed into it,' executive producer Gareth Neame told The Associated Press this week.

'We don't want to carpet bomb the retail sector.'

On October 12, British retail chain Marks & Spencer will launch its Downton Abbey beauty line in 250 stores and online. The range includes soap, nail polish, lip gloss, lotion and scented candles.

The items are whimsically packaged and inscribed with quotations from the series, including the advice offered by Maggie Smith's Dowager Countess of Grantham in the first episode: 'No one wants to kiss a girl in black.'

Downton merchandising in the U.S. and Canada is handled by Knockout Licensing, which has struck deals for a jewellery range from Danbury Mint and Downton-themed Christmas ornaments from Kurt Adler - both going on sale later this year.

It also has a licensing agreement with figurine manufacturer Bradford Exchange, raising fans' hopes for a range of Downton dolls - Scheming Thomas and Admirable Bates, perhaps.

North American fans also can soon drink Downton Abbey wine, marketed by Wines That Rock, the California company behind Rolling Stones' 40 Licks Merlot and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon Cabernet Sauvignon.

The Downton red is a French claret reminiscent of those favored by the early 20th-century British aristocracy.

Cele Otnes, a professor of marketing at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says the richly detailed world of Downton Abbey is key to viewers' intense bond with the show

She likens it to Mad Men saying: 'It's not just a television program, it's really an aesthetic' - and cites reported rises in sales of cravats, waistcoats and sherry as evidence of a Downton-driven appetite for Edwardian elegance.

'It's that whole thing about presenting a lifestyle,' she said.

'We get in the house, we get inside these characters' lives. We see inside their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their kitchens. We can absorb ourselves not only in the story, which is compelling, but in the details of their lives.'

No detail is too small to be cashed in on - down to the paint on the abbey walls.

Mylands, the London-based paint company that supplies the show with historically accurate pigments, recently began marketing two of its Downton tones to the public - Amber Grey, the color of the downstairs kitchen overseen by cook Mrs. Patmore, and Empire Grey, which adorns Mr. Carson's butler's pantry.

These are not just any greys. They are Downton greys.

'On the sets they look quite dark because they use them below stairs,' said Mylands spokeswoman Simone Barker. But in real life, 'they do look extremely chic.'

Otnes hopes the products manage to remain tasteful rather than tacky. As a fan, she urges producers to 'take a page from Lord and Lady Grantham's pool of reserve" and limit the range of merchandise,

'I hope they don't over-market the show,' she said.

Marks & Spencer is launching a Downton Abbey beauty line, including soap, nail polish, lip gloss, lotion and scented candles, on October 12. The Downton Abbey Fragranced Candle (£8.50) and the three-shade Lip Gloss collection (£9.50)

The items are whimsically packaged and adorned with quotations from the series- Downton Abbey Lip Balm Duo (£5)

Neame - who heads Downton production company Carnival Films, owned by NBC Universal - isn't worried.

'I don't have a nervous attitude about the idea of merchandising,' said Neame, who personally approves every item of merchandise.

'When a show is this global and this loved, I don't see any problem with offering products to hardened fans who want to extend their relationship with the show that they love.

'We are businesspeople. We are running a business, which is to create intellectual property and to monetise it.

'We sell as many DVDs as we can, and we sell the show in as many countries as we can, and you know what, by doing that we get the money on the screen and it allows me to finance other shows that we want to make and employ people. So I'm not coy about the merchandising and its purpose.'
