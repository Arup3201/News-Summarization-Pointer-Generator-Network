It proved to be a miserable World Cup for Chris Smalling, with the Manchester United defender part of the England squad which bombed out in the group stage at Brazil.

But the 24-year-old has already put the South American disappointment behind him by spending time in the off-season with girlfriend Sam Cooke.

The pair posed for a selfie while on holiday, before Smalling prepares to return to pre-season training with the Red Devils.

On a personal level the centre-back, proved faultless in Brazil as he played just one match in the 0-0 draw with Costa Rica, by which stage England were already eliminated.

But in travelling with the England squad, Smalling is allowed extra time off before returning for Manchester United's pre-season which began on Monday.
