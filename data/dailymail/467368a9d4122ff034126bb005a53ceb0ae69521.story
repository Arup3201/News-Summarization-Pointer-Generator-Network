An author and columnist has drawn comparisons between Ann Romney's view of motherhood and those of Hitler and Stalin.

Michelle Goldberg described an article written by Mrs Romney in praise of motherhood as 'creepy' because she had talked about the 'crown of motherhood'. 

On a weekend talk show, Ms Goldberg, who
was written a book on female reproduction and regularly features as a political commentator, told viewers that the phrase used by Mrs Romney reminded her of Hitler and Stalin's regimes.

Ms Goldberg said: 'It's authoritarian societies that give out like a Cross of Motherhood. They give out awards for big families... You know, Stalin did it, Hitler did it.'

In an article for USA Today called Three Seasons of Motherhood, Mrs Romney wrote: 'But no matter where we are or what we're doing, one hat that moms never take off is the crown of motherhood. There is no crown more glorious.'

In April, Ann Romney's was attacked by Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen who accused her of having ‘never worked a day in her life’ as a stay-at-home mother of five sons.

Michelle Goldberg has written two books, Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism and The Means of Reproduction: Sex, Power and the Future of the World. She is married and lives in Brooklyn, New York with her husband.

She defended her comments on Msnbc's Up With Chris Hayes in an article for the Daily Beast but
conceded: 'To me, bombastic odes to traditional maternity have a 
sinister ring, especially when they come from people who want to curtail
women’s rights.

'I 
should have realized that right-wingers were going to pretend that I was
saying that Romney is akin to two of the century’s most murderous 
tyrants.'
