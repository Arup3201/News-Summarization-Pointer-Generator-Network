A Christian ministry's long-stalled plans to build Noah's Ark in the hills of Kentucky have been revived.

Creation Museum founder Ken Ham announced Thursday that a municipal bond offering has raised enough money to begin construction on the Ark Encounter project, estimated to cost about $73 million. Groundbreaking is planned for May and the ark is expected to be finished by the summer of 2016.

Ham said a high-profile evolution debate he had with 'Science Guy' Bill Nye on February 4 helped boost support for the project.

Nye said he was 'heartbroken and sickened for the Commonwealth of Kentucky' after learning that the project would move forward.

He said the ark would eventually draw more attention to the beliefs of Ham's ministry, which preaches that the Bible's creation story is a true account, and as a result, 'voters and taxpayers in Kentucky will eventually see that this is not in their best interest.'

Ham's Answers in Genesis ministry and the Creation Museum enjoyed an avalanche of news media attention during the debate, which focused on science and the Bible's explanations of the origins of the universe.

Answers in Genesis unveiled the proposal in 2010 for a $150 million theme park that would include the ark. But private donations to the project did not keep pace with the construction timeline, forcing its backers to delay the ark's construction and divide the park development into phases. The bonds were offered last year by the city of Williamstown, site of the planned ark about 40 miles south of Cincinnati.

Ham said the bond issue faced many 
obstacles, including what he called misleading news media reports and 
attempts by opponents to disrupt the bond offering.

Ham
 would not disclose the total amount of bond funds raised because of 
underwriter restrictions. But a December bond document describing the 
project listed the amount at $62 million. Mark Looy, a vice president 
with Answers in Genesis, said the figure is less than $62 million, and 
that the minimum funding requirement was achieved.

Nye
 brushed off a question about whether he might be criticized for taking 
part in a debate that boosted fundraising for the ark.

'Me? I've always been criticized,' he said.

The bonds are to be repaid through revenue from the park, and the city is not liable for the money, according to bond documents.

The
 wooden ark would have old-world details, such as wooden pegs instead of
 nails, straight-sawed timbers and plenty of animals - some alive, some 
robotic.

The Creation Museum
 opened in 2007 and has been criticized by scientists as an affront to 
evolution science. Ham said Thursday that 2 million visitors have 
entered the museum since it opened.
