Iain Duncan Smith, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has been tasked with finding significant cuts to the pension bill

Ministers are looking at privatising the state pension as part of a drive to cut costs, it emerged last night.

Iain Duncan Smith’s department have been told they could save significant sums by contracting a private firm to issue the 4.5million pension statements every year in the UK and abroad.

The plan is contained in a leaked copy of the Department of Work of Pensions’ Efficiency Review, which is marked ‘restricted’ which discusses how to meet a target to shave a third off its budget.

The department is the biggest in Whitehall and issues nearly £100billion of public money to millions of pensioners every year. It faces an ‘unprecedented reform challenge’ the review states.

Mr Duncan Smith will have his operational budget slashed by 34pc to £6.3bn by 2016 from £9bn in 2009-10. Almost £2bn of those savings will need to be made in the next two financial years.

But the pensions expert Ros Altmann said she was seriously concerned by the idea that firms such as Capita, Serco or G4S could be brought in to administer public money to millions of pensioners.

An 80-page review, seen by The Guardian states that opportunities to make major savings ‘are limited...as much of the low hanging fruit has already gone.’

It says the department has already made savings and ‘to deliver anything greater, they would need to ‘to look more fundamentally at how it delivers its business, and consider some more strategic shifts.’

Currently the government runs ten pension centres around the country including in Dundee, Newcastle, Swansea and Blackpool, which employ 7,000 staff.

Labour's Dame Anne Begg, said 93 per cent of pensioners were satisfied or very satisfied with the current model. File picture

Miss Altman said a private firm would save money by reducing the pay and conditions of staff or the quality of the service, and charges could go up in the end.

‘We’re dealing with a vulnerable group and a massive number of people, so I would be seriously concerned about outsourcing a service like this, which is working well, with a view that it might make some short-term savings’, she said.

The chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, Labour’s Dame Anne Begg, said she would not want to see the service tendered out to private companies and pointed out that 93 per cent of pensioners were satisfied or very satisfied with the current model.

‘The pension service is one of the success stories of the DWP. There is a very high satisfaction rate and very few complaints about it. [So] if it’s a success story and it ain’t broke I’m not sure why they would want to upset that. If you end up with a poorer service as a result then it’s not good value for the taxpayer’, she said.
