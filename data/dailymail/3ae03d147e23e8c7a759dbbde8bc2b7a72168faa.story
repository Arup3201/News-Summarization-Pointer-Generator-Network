Trying to find a comfortable way to catch a quick nap on the move is a feat that has eluded even the most experienced traveller.

But help could soon be at hand – literally.

A new product which allows users to strap a portable pillow to their arms, hands or elbow has now been designed, and which promises to ‘continue the napping revolution’.

The Ostrich Pillow Mini allows users to strap a portable pillow to their arms, hands or elbow, and rest their heads on desks or against walls

The product has been described as ‘Quality Napping Within Arm’s Reach’, with the designers heralding the ‘cutting-edge design which is intriguingly cool’

The Ostrich Pillow Mini has been created by the same company who developed the Ostrich Pillow - a bizarre invention that looks like a padded balaclava and allows wearers to rest their head and hands inside.

The product, which has been designed by a young team of creatives called Studio Banana Things, is currently being advertised on crowdfunding website Kickstarter.

The firm initially wanted to raise $15,000 (£9,300) in order to commence production, but just two days after being placed on the Kickstarter website they have already exceeded that amount with donations currently reaching $15,466.

The inventors claim it will prove popular with office workers and acceptable with many organisations who ‘understand and acknowledge the correlation between sleep and performance'

People who make donations are being offered free Ostrich Pillow Minis in return for their money.

It is hoped that the product will be manufactured between the end of October and the beginning of December, with the first batch ready for sale by mid-December.

The inventors claim it will also prove popular with office workers and acceptable with many organisations who ‘understand and acknowledge the correlation between sleep and performance, making sleeping at work even more acceptable'.

They add that many companies are already ‘taking steps to tackle our sleep deficiencies through introducing state of the art sleep facilities at work’.

The product has been described as ‘Quality Napping Within Arm’s Reach’, with the designers heralding the ‘cutting-edge design which is intriguingly cool’.

They add: ‘It comes in four fashionable colours, resembles a cute cartoon character, or perhaps an ostrich egg, yet fits like a glove and is the grooviest little portable pillow.’

The pillow straps on to users’ arms, elbows or hands, allowing them to rest their head comfortably in a variety of positions either on a desk or table, or against a wall.

The invention comes a couple of years after Studio Banana Things, headed by inventor Ali Ganjavian, released the Ostrich Pillow in 2012.

No more distractions: The invention was designed to block out any noise or bright lights

The Ostrich Pillow offered a solution for resting for on the go -power naps

The quirky idea is a cross between a luxury pillow and a balaclava which wearers can rest their head and hands inside and which allows users to comfortably nap anywhere they like - whether it's at a desk at work, an airport or on a train.

Mr Ganjavian came up with after feeling tired at work.

The 35-year-old hopes his latest invention will revolutionise the powernap and prove to be a worldwide hit.

The inventor, who was born in Romsey, Hampshire, said recently: 'We spend many hours working all day and sleep is an essential part of our day.

'So I thought why not create a product that can help us unwind at work.'

The name is inspired by the way ostriches bury their heads in the sand.

Mr Ganjavian, who now lives in Madrid, Spain, said: 'I think it's a useful product that makes you smile whenever you see it.'

It has a hole for the wearer's mouth and two 'shelters' above the ears for their hands.

The product, which costs £50, proved immediately popular and clocked up 500 sales in its first week.

Mr Ganjavian set up his company with a friend from university in 2000.

They now have offices in America, France, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Previous inventions include the Deskshell, which offers privacy to computer users in open-plan offices.
