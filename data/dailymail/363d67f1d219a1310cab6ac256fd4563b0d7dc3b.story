One family traveling from Kennebunk, Maine to Tennessee believes a miracle saved them from being obliterated by an 18-wheeler truck. The massive truck hit where the family's 9-year-old daughter had been sitting just moments before her father pushed her out of harm's way.

Justin and Katie Sweeney were with their two children Molly, 9, and Carter, 7, when their Toyota Prius was crushed along with a pile of 35 vehicles on Interstate 95 On December.26. The family was injured, but astonishingly all of them survived.

Strangely enough, there was no prediction of snow before the family's departure on the 26th. Harsh snow hit five minutes right before the accident occurred.

The Sweeney family are lucky to be alive after their car was nearly missed by an 18-wheeler truck that could have cost them their lives

Justin, who is a pastor at the New Life Church in Biddeford, Maine, recalls pushing his 9-year old daughter out of harm's way just before a huge 18-wheeler truck struck their car.

'As I look at the pictures [of the vehicle] and as I remember that day so vividly, I truly know that it is a miracle that I should have my entire family together, that I didn’t lose my entire family in that crash,' Justin Sweeney said. 'It was the worst day of my life, but a day of blessings. You hug your family tighter and are so thankful for them,' Justin told the Bangor Daily News.

The family is now recovering from their non-life threatening injuries. Justin suffered a partially collapsed lung and broken sternum, Molly suffered from numerous pelvic fractures, and Carter and his mom Katie only suffer from scratches and bruises.

'It just crushed through the whole driver’s side of our vehicle. Molly ended up in the middle seat of the Prius and where she was sitting I looked up and there was the gas tank of the 18-wheeler,' said Katie Sweeney.

Katie recalls pushing down on the brakes, but she was no match for the icy roads. The family later crawled out the vehicle, gently taking Molly out of the wreckage.

Their car was entrenched in a 35-car pile up on a Pennsylvania highway

'We laid Molly down in the cab. She had her head in Carter’s lap and he was patting her cheeks and he kept telling her, ‘God must have a really great plan for us because we’re still alive,’ Katie Sweeney said.

'He’s 7 and he’s consoling her. It was a real precious moment and we were able to pray together and sing together and it helped to calm their nerves, calm the whole atmosphere. We realized we were all OK and we were going to be all right,' said Katie.

The family was initially taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Reading, Pennsylvania where they had x-rays and numerous tests. Molly was airlifted to The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Justin was airlifted to the Pennsylvania Hospital, also in Philadelphia.

Katie and Carter who only suffered minor injuries were treated and released.

The family's hometown of Kennebunk Maine is doing all they can to support the family and help them heal after they returned from their week of treatment in Pennsylvania hospitals.

Justin recalls instinctively pushing his 9-year-old daughter Molly out of harm's way

Since medical bills can run high, a friend of the family named Nicole Rossics set up a gofundme.com account to help the family raise money to get well. So far the page has raised over their $10,000 goal.

That goal started at $3,000, then $5,000, but kept going up as charitable donors exceeded the amounts.

'When I heard this happened, it’s like ‘oh my gosh,’ you just want to help,' Rossics said.

'They’re just good, good, good people. These things only happen to the best people,' said Rossics.

Molly and Nicole Rossics' daughter both do gymnastics together and when Rossics heard of the accident, she felt the need to help the family.

Molly competes as a gymnast competitively but currently is in a wheel chair.The family says she has done 'miraculously well' with physical therapy but that she still has a long way to go.

'She’s just as strong as she can be, she’s incredible. She has this little stubborn determination side to her, which is helpful in these situations,' Katie Sweeney said.

'We’ve absolutely been blown away by the support of friends and family, our church family, our neighbors,' Justin Sweeney said.

'People have been so creative with their generosity and kindness. They’ve gone above and beyond,' he continued.

Their Toyota Prius was completely totaled after the freak accident

Even though the Sweeneys are thankful for help, they also find it hard to accept.

'Anything you can give as a thank you just seems to fall so short. What card can I write in order to make it sound worthy of what is being done? There are just no words that can really describe how we feel,' she said.

'It’s humbling. We feel loved. It’s always a little bit more fun to be on the giving end. At the same time, this is how the Lord is choosing to organize things and I certainly don’t think it’s a coincidence. I think things are orchestrated for a reason. I’m so thankful people’s hearts are soft for us. We feel very loved and fortunate to be here in this community.'

Katie Sweeney told the Bangor Daily News that this Holiday, the Sweeney family got the best gift they could ever ask for.

'I look around at my family and we are each other’s greatest gifts,' she said. 'We’re very lucky to have each other.'
