A teenage brain cancer sufferer whose love of Taylor Swift sparked a social media campaign that helped her meet her idol, has died.

Kayla Kincannon, 18, lost her two-year battle against the crippling disease on Wednesday, just a week before her high school graduation.

The Michigan teen's fighting spirit inspired her Lamphere High School classmates, and even caught the attention of her country music hero who invited her to Nashville for lunch.

'She (Swift) had a way of making you feel like you were talking to one of your best friends,' Kincannon said of the incredible meeting in January last year.

News of the teen's death has devastated her family and friends, with her classmates releasing purple and gray balloons in a special memorial service on Thursday. 

'She was an inspiration to many and an 
example of the need to fight through adversity and (not) let obstacles 
stand in your way,' Greg Fuller, principal of Lamphere High School, told Detroit Free Press.

Fuller said Kincannon, a poetry and arts lover, wanted to attend her June 7 graduation ceremony. The 
school made her a diploma a few weeks ago and will present it to her 
family.

'Even when she was going through 
treatments and her legs were giving out on her and she was physically 
unable to get around very well, she was OK with getting a scooter and 
going to school every morning,' family friend Vicki VanSickle said.

Tragic: Kayla Kincannon, 18, was diagnosed with brain cancer when she was 16

Kincannon 
was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was 16. She underwent 
chemotherapy and radiation treatments after doctors removed part of the 
tumor.

But
 a few days before her 17th birthday in December 2012, doctors found a 
second spot on her brain. The teen's condition slowly deteriorated.

That's when Kincannon's family and friends jumped into action, starting a social media campaign to help Kincannon meet her singing idol, Swift.

Her loved ones sent out tweets with the hashtag #OperationGetKaylaToMeetTaylorSwift in the hope the singer would notice. The phrase became a top trending topic on Twitter, catching Swift's attention.

The 'Love Story' singer arranged a two-hour lunch with her fan in Tennessee, making the sick teen's dream come true.

'Can not believe I just had lunch w @taylorswift13 today, I was enchanted to meet you! Lol,' Kincannon tweeted.

Kincannon's funeral will be held on Sunday.
