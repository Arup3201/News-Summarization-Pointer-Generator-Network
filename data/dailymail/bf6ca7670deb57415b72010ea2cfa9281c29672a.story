They drove 33,000 miles around the world without mishap in a 55-year-old classic car.

But when Geoffrey and Hilary Herdman got back to Britain they found a large dent in the side of the 1956 Bristol 405 Drophead Coupe after leaving it in a Sainsbury’s car park.

The retired couple took 16 months to complete the trip they described as a ‘wrinkly gap year’ in the Bristol, of which only 42 were made. The convertible is believed to be worth around £90,000.

Despite encountering some of the 
toughest roads in the world without any problems, it was when they got 
home that they ran into trouble. Having popped into the supermarket they
returned to their prized car and found that another motorist had dented
it.

Mr Herdman said while they were travelling they were constantly warned 
about the dangers – from theft of the vehicle to kidnap and worse – but 
other than a few minor repairs, including a couple of punctures, they 
did not have any problems.

The Herdmans said that wherever they stopped, such as here in Panama, the car would attract much attention

‘It was a very nice reflection on human 
nature,’ said the 68-year-old retired chartered accountant, who shared 
the driving with his 70-year-old wife.

‘The bad thing is when we got back I leave the car in Sainsbury’s car 
park and find there is a large dent in the nearside front wing. Someone 
had obviously crocked it parking next to me.’

During the couple’s first 
24,000 miles they only had to spend £79 on repairs. But the dent in the 
car could cost them around £300.

Mr Herdman finished off the restoration of the Bristol – started by its 
previous owner – after buying it in 1999 and had it back on the road in 
2001.

Since then the president of the Bristol Owners Club has completed around
135,000 miles in the car and believes it has done around 500,000 miles 
in total.

Mr Herdman and his wife, a retired lawyer, started their journey in July
2010 from Miami, driving up the east coast of North America to Halifax 
before crossing Canada and then heading south down the west coast.

After a couple of months in South America, they headed across to 
Australia before the car was shipped back via Turkey for the drive home 
through Europe. The couple, who are from London and currently live in 
Sussex, returned to the UK last month.

The Royal Automobile Club is to put the Bristol on display in its clubhouse in London’s Pall Mall from January 3.
