Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland has been invited to join the rota of future Open Championships, and is likely to host the world's greatest golf tournament in 2019.

It will be the first time the Open returns to Northern Ireland in more than 63 years, after Portush staged it in 1951.

The news comes after Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clark called for Portrush to be added, given their successful hosting of the Irish Open in 2012.

Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson announced the news.

Mr Robinson said: 'This is wonderful news, not only for Royal Portrush Golf Club, but for the whole of Northern Ireland, with an estimated combined tourism promotion and economic return of £70million.

'The decision to bring the Open back to Northern Ireland is a tremendous vote of confidence in the game here and follows the huge success of the Irish Open in 2012, the first in European Tour history to sell out.

'Today's announcement recognises that Northern Ireland not only has some of the world's greatest golfers, but some of the world's greatest golf courses.'

Proud: Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson says is was a 'tremendous vote of confidence'
