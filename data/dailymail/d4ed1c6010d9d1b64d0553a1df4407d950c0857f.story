Gordan Strachan has revealed he already knows which goalkeeper will be handed the task of keeping world champions Germany at bay in Dortmund this weekend.

But the Scotland boss will pick his moment to break the news after choosing between Allan McGregor, David Marshall and Craig Gordon posed one of the toughest calls of his 18-month tenure.

‘I’m clearer,’ said Strachan on the issue. ‘I’ve been clear for a while. But it’ s a hard one and then you see Craig Gordon come in and you think, “Whoa”.

‘The goalkeeping coach Jim Stewart is really pleased with him and you wouldn’t know he’s been away.

‘I haven’t told them who is playing yet — I’ll tell them after the game!

‘That’s something I need to discuss with Jim. You never know the best moment to tell them. You have to sense when that is for everyone.

‘It’s not like it has to be at a specific time, but it will be before the team in general is announced, that’s for sure.’

Former Scotland No 1 Gordon had made way for Hull’s McGregor and Cardiff keeper Marshall after spending two years on the sidelines with knee problems.

Back playing first-team football with Celtic, however, the 31-year-old’s return has created the strongest goalkeeper pool a Scotland boss has had to choose from in years.

‘It’s usually been two, thinking back to Andy Goram and Jim Leighton,’ Strachan admitted.

‘Look at England as well when they had Peter Shilton and Ray Clemence. You couldn’t remember the third one.

‘So we’re strong and it’s a fantastic bonus having Craig along here, it really is.

‘The goalie’s position is more specialised and you can maybe move outfield players around a wee bit more.

‘But whoever is not playing, they know that there is a great goalie in front of them - but that they are a great goalie, too.

‘Sometimes the goalie can be picked depending on whether or not you are away or at home, believe it or not.’

Strachan confirmed Darren Fletcher will be his captain following his successful return to the Manchester United first team but he lost another midfielder, West Brom star Graham Dorrans, to injury yesterday.

Christophe Berra and young left-back Andrew Robertson have also pulled out, with Aberdeen’s Mark Reynolds the only replacement so far.

Revealed: Strachan said he would wait until the right time to inform the players about who would start

On Dorrans, Strachan said: ‘He has been playing with an injury the last few weeks.

‘It was great he came up here and gave it a couple of days’ rest and tried to train yesterday, but he wasn’t comfortable, so he is away back to his club now to get assessed.

‘Christophe has been scoring goals, as well. But his injury was bad enough not to allow him to travel.

‘Andy came up and tried his best. We felt it wasn’t worthwhile pushing it because he couldn’t train.

‘We are okay. We are happy with the training we have done. Everybody else has been involved.

‘We picked a few extra players because we knew we might get some knocks, so we are well covered.’
