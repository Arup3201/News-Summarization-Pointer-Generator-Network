Missing: Police fear for the safety of Jaidon Hill, 7, who vanished with his mother and step-father

The hunt for a missing Mississippi family has ended in tragedy after detectives found three bodies in an abandoned house near the spot where the family's SUV crashed and burned.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation arrested 42-year-old Timothy Lydell Burns Tuesday after he led authorities to the remains of Jaidon Hill, 7; his mother, Atira Hughes-Smith, 30; and his step-father, 34-year-old Laterry Smith in rural Copiah County.

All three were shot to death.

However, police have not commented on the circumstances of their deaths or why Burns allegedly killed them.

It is not known whether Burns knew the three victims or whether he was a stranger.

The circumstances of the disappearance of Hill, Mrs Hughes-Smith and Mr Smith has baffled police every since they vanished Friday night.

Hours later, the family's SUV was found burned out and flipped on its roof in a ditch along side a rural road.

WDBD-TV showed video of detectives carrying three body bags out of the woods near the abandoned, run-down house Tuesday.

On Monday Mrs Hughes-Smith's ID, clothes and other belongings were found in a garbage Dumpster outside a grocery store in nearby Jackson, Mississippi.Â

The Jackson Clarion-Ledger reports that the garbage bin is near the house where Laterry Smith's mother and two sisters lived.

The three family members reportedly had moved out of the house on Sunday night after the family was reported missing.

Jaidon,
Mrs Hughes-Smith and Mr Smith were last heard from Friday night when 
Mrs Hughes-Smith called family members to say she was leaving town for a
few days.

However, the call abruptly dropped.

On Saturday morning, police found the family's burned out SUV overturned in a ditch.

The vehicle was charred and its front-bumper was smashed and it was resting on its roof.

The family was nowhere to be found and there are no clues as to what may have happened to them.

'We have no idea where these people are,' Copiah County Sheriff Harold Jones told ABC News.

'We have some people we need to talk to, but we can't find them.'

Police initially thought that Mrs Hughes-Smith and Mr Smith torched the truck as a form of insurance fraud - a practice not uncommon in the area. However, they have since ruled out that explanation.

Jones will not say whether he believed foul play is involved, though he will not rule it out, either.

Jaidon is 3 feet tall, 44 pounds, black skin and brown eyes. Atira Hughes-Smith is 5 feet tall, 148 pounds, black with brown eyes and brown hair.

Laterry Smith is 5-foot-8, 180 pounds and black with browns eyes and brown hair.
