The 30-year-old woman charged with attempted murder after leaving her newborn son in a drain in western Sydney has been remanded in custody until December 12 for a possible bail application.

The accused did not appear in Penrith Local Court during a very brief hearing before Magistrate Brian Van Zuylen.

The woman, who is the daughter of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor, had been living with her aunt and uncle in the western Sydney suburb of Quakers Hill when she became pregnant and kept her condition secret for nine months.

 The 30-year-old woman charged with attempted murder after leaving her newborn son in a drain in western Sydney has been remanded in custody until December 12 for a possible bail application

After giving birth to a healthy baby boy at Blacktown hospital at 1am on Tuesday of last week, she discharged herself early that afternoon and, police allege, took her baby and placed him in a stormwater drain around 500m from her home.

The baby was apparently put through a small opening under the concrete slab over the drain and fell the 2.5m drop to the bottom.

The baby lay undisovered for five days in hot dry conditions.

The woman has been refused bail and remains in a women's jail  

On Sunday morning, David Otte and his daughter Hayley, heard cries coming from a drain as they were cycling near the M7 motorway.

They stopped, thinking it was a trapped small animal, and then called emergency services when they saw the baby.

Police from Quakers Hill Local Area Command retrieved the baby, which was wrapped in a pink striped blanket, from the drain.

The baby had blood on his head and was taken to hospital where it was found he was severely dehydrated and had bleeding on the brain.

Now 10 days old, the baby is in a stable condition in Westmead Hospital.

A Westmead Children's Hospital spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the baby is in the care of Family And Community Services.

 On Sunday morning, David Otte and his daughter Hayley, heard cries coming from a drain as they were cycling near the M7 motorway. They alerted authorities to the baby

Doctors said the baby was able to survive in the drain because of a lack of rain causing storm water which might have drowned him, along with newborns' natural ability to survive without food or water.

Police tracked down the mother and arrested her on Monday, charging her with attempted murder.

Magistrate Van Zuylen said the woman has still been refused bail.

Passersby outside court cried 'shame' as relatives crossed the street in Blacktown

The accused did not appear in Penrith Local Court during a very brief hearing before Magistrate Brian Van Zuylen but her family were present

She is being held in a Sydney women's prison and is expected to appear via audio visual link from jail in December.

Relatives told Daily Mail Australia they had been unaware of the woman's pregnancy and did not know who the father could be.

The woman's family quickly left the court on Monday, but she did not appear

The landlord of the house where the woman had been living with her extended family for at least two years said he had noticed the young woman had put on weight two or three months ago.

'I was delivering the water bill and I saw she was bigger and wearing loose clothes, but I didn't say anything.

'They are a very good family, clean. I see them with their Bibles.'

Three cars were parked outside the woman's house in Blacktown

The family are members of a Seventh Day Adventist Church in western Sydney. 

Police are believed to still be trying to formally identify the child's father.

Court documents state the child was placed in the 2.4-metre deep drain on Tuesday - less than 24 hours after he was born at Blacktown Hospital.

'The accused makes full admissions to putting the baby down the drain knowing it may kill the baby,' court documents said.

The woman will receive a medical assessment while behind bars, the court heard. 

David Otte and his 18-year-old daughter Hayley were two of the four cyclists who discovered the baby in a stormwater pit off the M7 at Quakers Hill.

They initially thought that the sounds were a kitten – but then Mr Otte realised that the cries were human.

'I've got two kids of my own so I know what a baby screaming sounds like,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald.

'It was so intense; you couldn't not tell it was a baby. We couldn't see it but we could hear it. It was distressed.'

The drain was covered by a concrete slab which weighed over 200kg and took six people to lift, including two police officers who had arrived at the scene. 

'You go through life seeing things but you never ever imagine you'll see something like this', Mr Otte, who only cycles the route once a month, said. 

The boy was lifted out of the drain by Senior-Constable Mark McAlister who climbed in with another officer to retrieve him. 

'How could someone do it? I, myself, have kids and we're expecting a baby in a few more months so it's not good that someone's going through this and has done this to a little one,' he said.
