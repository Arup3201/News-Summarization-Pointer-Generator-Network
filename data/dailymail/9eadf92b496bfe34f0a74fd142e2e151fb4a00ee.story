Wayne Rooney is set to miss Manchester United’s final home game against Hull City at Old Trafford on Tuesday as the England striker continues to nurse a groin strain ahead of the World Cup.

Although Rooney did some light training in the gym over the weekend, after sitting out the defeat by Sunderland, he is taking no chances just six days before Roy Hodgson names his provisional squad for Brazil.

It promises to be an emotional night, with United captain Nemanja Vidic making a farewell appearance at Old Trafford before he joins Inter Milan on a free transfer — and interim boss Ryan Giggs is believed to be considering the option of naming himself in the squad.

Giggs said: 'The perfect scenario is me coming on & scoring the winner, but it doesn’t always work like that. We’ll have to wait and see.'

The 40-year-old will 'take into consideration' the fact Tuesday’s game could be his last at Old Trafford, but insists: 'I want to do what’s best to win.'

A number of other United stars could also be playing there for the last time, including Patrice Evra. Like Vidic, the Frenchman will be out of contract at the end of the season more than eight years after they joined the club at the same time in January 2006, from Spartak Moscow and Monaco respectively.

The pair have since won five Premier League titles, the Champions League and three League Cups together, but Evra and the man he calls ‘The Rock’ could not have got off to a worse start.

‘I’m really sad because when I speak about Nemanja it’s like I’m speaking about myself because we joined the club together,’ said Evra.

‘Our first game was for the reserves and it was so hard. Rene (Meulensteen) was the manager and he took us both out of the match.

‘We were talking together in the dressing room and saying, “Oh my god, why have we come to Manchester United? We should go back to our clubs quickly!”

‘It was a difficult moment but we stuck together. We were in the same hotel, we went into training together, we won the same trophies. I’m really sad to lose The Rock.’

Although 40-year-old Giggs’s future at Old Trafford is unclear, Hull manager Steve Bruce believes United would be foolish not to offer him a significant role when Louis van Gaal takes over as manager.

Bruce, a former team-mate of Giggs at United, even joked that he’s got a job at Hull if he finds himself out of work in the summer.

Bruce said: ‘There’s always going to be a place for Ryan because he’s been a great. They’ll find a space for him somewhere.

‘I don’t think he’ll leave. If not, he can come and see out his days at the KC in the Europa League.  If he’s available on a free, I’d take him.’

With Premier League safety sealed, Bruce plans to make several changes to his team tonight as he plans for the FA Cup final on Saturday week.

Bruce added: ‘There’s five or six who pick themselves, really, but nothing’s a given.’
