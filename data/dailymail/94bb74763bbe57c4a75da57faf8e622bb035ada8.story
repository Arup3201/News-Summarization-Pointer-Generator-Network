On the eve of his initial appearance in a Texas court, Adrian Peterson is expected to plead not guilty to child abuse charges in a bid to hurry his return to the NFL.

The Minnesota Vikings running back is due to face charges of reckless or negligent injury to his four-year-old son.

The charges relate to Peterson using a switch, or a tree branch, to discipline his child in May. 

With 10,190 rushing yards to his name, Adrian Peterson faces an uncertain future in the NFL 

The 2012 MVP will appear in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County following his indictment by a grand jury. Peterson was detained briefly and released on bond in September.

Mary Flood, spokesperson to Peterson's attorney Rusty Hardin said: 'We expect him to plead not guilty if asked by the judge tomorrow.'

The 29-year-old said he was not trying to injure the child and that his actions reflected the types of discipline he received growing up.

Cases of this type are normally dealt with in nine to 12 months, so it appears likely that Peterson's 2014 season is over - unless Hardin can secure a quick trial date.

It is unclear whether he will be asked to enter a plea. Peterson could be sentenced to up to two years in prison and fined $10,000 if convicted of the charge.

A six-time Pro Bowl running back, Peterson played in the Vikings' season-opener against the St Louis Rams before being dropped for the defeat to the New England Patriots in week two.

He was reinstated briefly, drawing widespread criticism and the loss of a major sponsor, the Radisson hotel group. The Vikings then put their star player on the NFL's exempt/commissioner's permission list.

While he is still earning his $11.75million salary, he is barred from all team activities until his case is resolved.

The incident is one of several domestic violence or abuse cases that have marred the league's reputation.

Details of the charges against Peterson came just days after the release of a video showing Ray Rice knocking out his future wife in an Atlantic City casino lift.

Rice had been suspended two games for the incident involving his then-fiancee, but was released by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL after the video circulated.
