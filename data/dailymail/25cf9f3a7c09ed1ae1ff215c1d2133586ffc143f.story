Tim Sherwood's negotiations with QPR have taken another twist after it emerged that he is still in dispute with Brazilian midfielder Sandro.

The pair’s relationship disintegrated when Sherwood replaced Andre Villas-Boas as manager of Tottenham last season, but he was then sacked just six months after accepting the job.

Sandro was sold to QPR at the end of the season, but he hardly featured under Harry Redknapp because of a knee injury sustained shortly after his move from White Hart Lane.

Sandro criticised Sherwood repeatedly during his spell as manager at Tottenham and even told a Brazilian TV station that he would be sacked at the end of the season.

When Sandro was axed by Sherwood for the Barclays Premier League clash with Fulham on March 16, the midfielder posted a message on social media confirming that he was not injured.

Sherwood responded by claiming Sandro was ‘not good enough to be in the side at the moment’.

He added: ‘When he shows me he’s up to the level of the other players he’ll be back in the squad.’

Sandro did return to start Tottenham’s the final game of the season, but he then told ESPN Brazil: ‘Sherwood will leave at the end of the season. Then it’s a new coach - a new everything. I am happy at the moment.’

On Monday, QPR coach Chris Ramsey revealed that they are planning to play Sandro in some Under 21 matches before he returns to the relegation battle with the first team.

There are already huge issues at QPR because of a dysfunctional dressing room and Tony Fernandes does not want his new manager to get off on the wrong footing.

Sherwood, who has been out of work since leaving Spurs at the end of last season, is continuing to talk to Rangers about succeeding Redknapp.
