Firm: David Cameron, pictured in Afghanistan yesterday, has banned all ministers from their chauffeur-driven cars but the diktat has not been received well

Ministers have been ordered to ditch their chauffeur-driven cars and use public transport to travel to the Olympics.

The Prime Minister, who insists he will catch the Tube to London 2012 events, has also told every minister they must not take their family to events, even if they paid for the tickets themselves.

According to a source, they must invite dignitaries and other important guests instead, to ensure the public don’t think they are abusing their positions.

Earlier this week Mr Cameron confirmed he would go to Olympic events on public transport and expected everyone to follow suit.

But furious MPs have said they would rather watch the Games on TV than cram onto the underground or buses, which would leave them too grumpy to schmooze their guests.

But the diktats have angered many, who feel that it will give off a bad impression.

'This has caused a lot of ill-feeling and frankly some of us would rather not be going to anything at all,' one senior minister told the Independent.

'The
rules are unbelievably draconian. We've basically been told we're on 
our own and have to look after our guests with no official support and 
we'll have to go by Tube as well.

'I know they're worried about 
how it will look if we're seen to get special treatment but at the end 
of the day we're supposed to be representing the Government. I'd rather 
be sitting at home watching it on television.'

While touring Afghanistan yesterday Mr Cameron confirmed he would be going to events on public transport and so should everybody else.

Told: Instead David Cameron and his colleagues will have to cram onto the tube 'like everybody else'

The Olympic flag was this morning flying on top of 10 Downing Street

'I will be using public transport and 
that is how I recommend [everyone] should travel'.' he said. 'I now use 
the Tube, I drive my protection team mad in London by saying why on 
earth are we in the car, the Tube is quicker.

When asked about whether he would use the 'ZiL' lanes, named after the limousines used in Soviet Russia at the height of Communism, he said: 'We are banished from using that terminology.

'I went in a Games lane, but it was not acting as a Games lane when I came back from Chequers on Sunday. We were happily driving on it because everyone else was driving on it.'

And Downing Street confirmed that almost without exception politicians will not go by car.

'All ministers will be expected to travel to the Games like everybody else,' a No. 10 spokesman told MailOnline this morning.

'There will be some limited circumstances when this might be waived but as a general rule that is what they have been told.'

Last
week it was revealed that at least 60 ministers and senior MPs has been
told to report for duty during the Games and accompany VIPs to events.

David Cameron alone will be taking executives from Google, Citigroup and Cisco Systems.

They
will have access to thousands of tickets bought at the taxpayers' 
expense, including 350 in total for both opening and closing ceremonies.

It came as an extra 1,200 troops were put on standby to protect the Olympics as the fallout continues from the G4S fiasco.

Defence
chiefs yesterday placed the servicemen and women – some recently back 
from Afghanistan – on 48 hours notice to work as guards at London 2012.

Home
Secretary Theresa May and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt begged the 
Ministry of Defence to provide additional military back-up amid concerns
that beleaguered private firm G4S is still struggling to recruit 
security staff.

Curbed: Ministers will only be able to use Games Lanes in exceptional circumstances
