The University of St Andrews has been forced to apologise to hundreds of prospective students after wrongly telling them that their applications had been successful.

The 'congratulations' email was intended for a small group of new students who had already been offered a place, inviting them to an open day at the renowned Scottish university.

But it was accidentally sent to 760 applicants who were anxiously waiting for news - making them think they had been accepted when a decision had yet to be made.

The university, where Prince William and Kate Middleton met as students, sent a second email apologising for the mix-up 30 minutes later.

It blamed the error on 'human error compounded by technology' and said it was sorry for any disappointment caused. 

Disappointed applicants took to Twitter to vent their frustration, with one user tweeting that the mistake was 'brutal'.

According to the Times, the initial email read: 'Congratulations on your offer of a place to study here at the University of St Andrews!

'You may have already chosen St Andrews as your firm choice, but for those who have not, I know that there are many things for you to consider before making the choice of where you wish to study.

'To help you to make that decision, or just to give you a bit more information about student life here at St Andrews, I would like to offer you the opportunity to attend an information day here in St Andrews.'

Frustration: Disappointed applicants took to Twitter after they were wrongly sent the email on Thursday

A statement released by the university said: 'We're very sorry that we wrongly sent an email to some of our Scottish applicants which may have given the impression that we had made a decision on their applications.

'The email should have gone only to a very small group of people already in receipt of offers from us to invite them to attend visiting days in St Andrews.

'In total, 760 of 3456 applicants received this email in error.

'The email was sent by alphabetical order and we believe that only applicants with first names from A to D were affected.'

The statement added: 'We moved as quickly as possible to contact all our Scottish applicants to explain our mistake and apologise.

'A follow-up email was sent to all within half an hour of the initial mistake and our staff were on hand throughout yesterday afternoon and evening to respond to phone calls and questions from applicants.'

The problem was 'human error compounded by technology', the university statement said.

'The team involved is devastated and the university is extremely sorry for the confusion and disappointment it has caused some applicants.'
