Sleepless in Beijing? A Chinese film called Finding Mr. Right gets its inspiration from Sleepless in Seattle and has inspired flocks of romantic Chinese to visit the city

A Chinese box office smash inspired by the 1993 stateside hit Sleepless in Seattle is so popular it has fans crossing an ocean to recreate its charms.

Finding Mr. Right, which pays tribute to the Nora Ephron film with constant visual and spoken references, debuted in China in March and has since earned a whopping $85 million domestically.

Much of the film even takes place in Seattle and its huge popularity has romantic couples heading to American shores to recreate the film's recreation of a film.

'The phones started ringing and it 
hasn’t stopped. We have been amazed at the response,' Seattle tourism 
official Janet Christopher told KOMO. 'This is bigger than Sleepless in 
Seattle.'

The movie's success even spurred China's CCTV network to do a live broadcast from the city on New Year's Eve.

'With
 this movie, it just attracts booming Chinese visitors,' CCTV 
correspondent Qi Gao said. 'Especially for the young generation of 
Chinese, it’s not just for a destiny of traveling, it’s for a destiny of
 romance.'

The film stars actress Tang Wei as JiaJia, a spoiled mistress of a Beijing businessman who becomes pregnant.

Her
 lover sends her to Seattle in order to have the baby in secret and 
that's where she meets the film's male protagonist (and possible Mr. 
Right), Frank.

The leading ladies have their differences, but the constant references to Sleepless in Seattle are clear in Finding Mr. Right

'The phones started ringing and it hasn¿t stopped. We have been amazed at the response,' said Seattle tourism official Janet Christopher. 'This is bigger than Sleepless in Seattle.'

There are 
some bumps in the road as spoiled JiaJia begrudgingly becomes a better 
person and falls for Mr. Right just as in Sleepless in Seattle.

'It’s a 
romantic movie and it has really struck a chord with young women. All of
 these women relate and they want to come and see if they can find their
 ‘Mr. Right’ in Seattle,' Christopher said.

For
 those in American Sleepless in Seattle fans who'd like to judge for 
themselves if the movie passes muster compared to the Ephron classic, it
 opened in select US theaters in November.

Sleepless in Seattle was itself inspired by the 1957 film An Affair to Remember

'It¿s a romantic movie and it has really struck a chord with young women. All of these women relate and they want to come and see if they can find their ¿Mr. Right¿ in Seattle,' Christopher said
