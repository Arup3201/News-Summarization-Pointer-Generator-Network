Fox is gambling large on its upcoming reality series 'Utopia,' investing millions of dollars in the show that challenges 15 participants to create their own mini societies on a secluded piece of land.

'Utopia' is what the network calls its 'boldest' and 'most groundbreaking social experiment.'

It will put 15 people from all walks of life in a secluded plot of land in California, where they will build  their ideal civilization for one year — starting with no heat, no electricity and no plumbing.

The set includes a self-filtering lake and a barn, which will provide the participants with two dairy cows and twelve chickens.

The 15 'Utopians' start with no more than $10,000 and have to decide how to use it to develop their new economy and develop more of the land.

The show will air on Tuesday and some Fridays, and is expected to be Fox's big programming bet this fall

The roster includes a bellydancer, an ex-con, a veterinarian technician and a pregnant woman due in December.

'This is the most pure form of reality that I have ever produced in my career,' boasts executive producer John de Mol, the man behind 'Big Brother.'

'Utopia,' which debuts on Sept. 7 with a three-night premiere, comes with 200 crew members, hundreds of cameras and round-the-clock video streaming.

Fox has scheduled the show for Tuesdays and some Fridays, counting on it to replace 'X Factor' and 'American Idol.' The network will also stream the show online 24/7.

But so far, the series has seen plenty of snags.

Insiders say the network stands to spend $50 million on just 20 episodes — and is also struggling internally with a group of new producers involved in the show, TheWrap reported.

'The bill has arrived and it is on the very high end of staggering,' one network executive told the news outlet.

Executive producer Conrad Green told Variety the cost for the set was 'not insignificant,' though he wouldn't give any more details.

And this is a time of internal changes at Fox.

The man behind the project, ex-chairman Kevin Reilly, moved on in June — leaving a group of incoming executives to inherit the schedule he created, Variety reported.

It is also the first big project for Simon Andreae, in charge of alternative, who joined the network in October.

The dutch version of the show premiered in January and has thus far been a success, industry insiders say.
