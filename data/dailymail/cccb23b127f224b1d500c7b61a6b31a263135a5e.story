The Duchess of Cambridge's brother has emerged today as the man behind a service offering to print your Instagram photographs on to marshmallows.

The Boomf brand, which sells a box of nine marshmallows for £12, was launched two months ago by Mint Digital, but James Middleton’s involvement was only revealed today.

The announcement comes after it emerged earlier this month that he failed to make a profit with his food business for a second year.

According to The Next Web, Mr Middleton was introduced to the co-creators last summer, after being told to get in touch by a friend, Steve Finan, while watching Andy Murray at Wimbledon.

He explained to the website that the three criteria he wanted Boomf to meet were that the product had to be ‘delicious’, ‘personalizable’ and able to ‘fit through a letterbox’.

‘When I met Mint we clicked from the start,’ he said.

‘We have a very similar vision but are coming at it from totally different angles: Mint from digital and me from food.’

He said that the most enjoyable part of creating the product was coming up with its name, explaining that ‘Boomf is the noise a marshmallow makes when it falls through your letter box’.

He told the site he is currently working on the product ‘daily, pretty much full-time’. Before Christmas, he said the company got so many calls that he was forced to wear a ‘hair net (and beard net)’.

Andy Bell, of Mint Digital, said he was ‘amazed’ by the ability of Mr Middleton, adding: ‘He’s uncommonly imaginative and resourceful innovator.’

Meanwhile, Mr Middleton's cake and bread company Nice Group London Limited made a total loss of £21,148 for the 12 months to March 2013, the latest accounts filed showed.

It means the company, which was set up in April 2011, is yet to post a profit, having lost £19,928 in it's first year of trading. The company also owes creditors £35,951.
