A web-based fashion company has recreated the world’s oldest pants, which were discovered in China earlier this year, dating back to at least 1,000B.C.

Betabrand’s prototype called ‘World’s Oldest Pants’ is currently up for vote on the site as an item being considered for production.

They have modernized the drop-crotch style pants with lightweight fabric, utilizing the same groin patch, color, and pattern as the ancient original.

Modern interpretation: Betabrand's World's Oldest Pants aim to recreate the 3,000-year-old pants that were discovered in China earlier this year

The original: The pants, which date back to 1,000 B.C. (pictured) are said to confirm speculations that pants were invented to protect the human form as it commuted on horseback

The style will retail for somewhere 
between $75 and $100 - Betabrand owner Chris Lindland tells MailOnline -
 if the pants receive the necessary 300 votes to move forward.

At present, the pants have received 162 votes with ten days left for users to weight in.

The original pants were discovered in Xinjiang (an autonomous region in Northwest China) on the bodies of two men approximately aged 40 (both suspected to be warriors as well as herders) who belonged to the nomadic Subeixi culture.

As was previously long speculated by fashion historians, the pants’ discovery nearly confirms how the garment’s invention came about in an effort to protect the human form as it commuted on horseback.

Their discovery was first announced in a May 22 edition of Qauternary International, with vivid imagery of the torn garments which have maintained a miraculous shape, despite their 3,000-year-old age.

In the details: Betabrand has gone to great lengths to recreate the pants, including their signature cut-out crotch patch

In addition to historical connotations, Betabrand feels that the pants also demonstrate how the Subeixi ‘wanted to make a bold fashion statement,’ facetiously pointing out the relics’ ‘distressed retro styling’ and ‘classic dual-drawstring action’.

The site, which is famous for its community-invented wares that range from office-appropriate yoga pants to pinstripe ‘executive’ hoodies, often relies upon an item’s comments section to help shape an item’s final outcome.

In reference to World’s Oldest Pants these comments range from ‘will they smell authentic?’ to more useful ones like Dadalus Westland’s input, which reads: ‘Looks like the crotch piece was a heavier weight fabric to stand up to the abuse of horseback riding, and maybe act a little like padding. That should be kept in mind.’

Ron Jarvis struck a chord somewhere in the middle with his comment: ‘Cool yes, but it could still use a codpiece, just saying.’
