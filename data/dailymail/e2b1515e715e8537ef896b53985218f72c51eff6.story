The Premier League remains the most attractive football division in the world for global footballing talent, with more than 100 stars of the 2014 World Cup finals making a living at the 20 top-flight clubs.

Although Spain is widely - and rightly - seen as the destination of choice for a few handfuls of the very biggest names including Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Neymar and James Rodriguez, it is not so much La Liga as a whole that is the draw than its two biggest clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Spain as a whole is home to only 50 players on show at last year's World Cup, whereas the Premier League leads the way with 112 such players, ahead of Serie A (with 81) and Germany’s Bundesliga (75).

The ‘stardust factor’ is one of a range of measurements MailSport has considered as part of the most in-depth comparative study of the world’s football leagues.

Big names from most of the World Cup’s leading contenders make their home in the Premier League, from German World Cup winners Mesut Ozil, Andre Schurrle, and Lukas Podolski to Argentinean World Cup finalists Sergio Aguero, Angel Di Maria and Pablo Zabaleta. Oscar, Willian and Ramires are just three of the Brazilian semi-final squad playing in England, all at hot title favourites Chelsea. Robin Van Persie and Daley Blind are among the Dutch team who also reached the last four to ply their trade in England’s elite.

Seasoned international players from Cameroon to Croatia, from Chile to Spain and all points in between make their livings in club locations as diverse as Everton and Hull, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United.

Luis Suarez topped the bill as the biggest signing after Barcelona forked out £75million for the striker

The top divisions of Italy and Bundesliga are also global melting pots, albeit not on the scale of the Premier League while Spain and France are less attractive as a whole. ‘Smaller’ leagues providing dozens of players to the World Cup include the Russian Premier League (34), Turkey’s Super League (26), Liga MX in Mexico (26) and MLS (24).

Another measure of each’s league’s ‘pulling power’ is their clubs’ ability to spend large sums on transfer fees to help lure big names. In this respect, La Liga - or rather the big two clubs there - led the way in 2014, with Barca buying Suarez for around £75m being La Liga’s biggest buy.

The Premier League’s biggest buy was £59.7m Di Maria to United, whereas the biggest buys in Italy and Germany were both ‘only’ around the £20m mark, Roma buying Juan Iturbe for £17.2m and Bayern Munich buying Mehdi Benatia for £20.4m.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic is arguably the most glitzy player in France's Ligue 1, which came fifth in the study

Only four other leagues in the world had any top-price 2014 purchase at £10m or more: PSG in France bought David Luiz for £50m, Zenit of Russia bought Javi Garcia for £13m, Santos of Brazil bought Leandro Damiao for £10.2m, and Leeds of the Championship - included as a division in its own right - bought Ross McCormack for a fee that could rise to £11m.

In most leagues in the world, even the richest clubs can pay top prices of other single-digit millions or less for players. Some league spend little or even nothing on transfers, as happened in Colombia and Nigeria this year.

The finances of the Premier League underpin an ability to attract big names - and that is one reason for England’s top level having the most World Cup stars working there.
