Aussies are known for possessing a unique sense of humour and the Mambo surf clothing label has successfully tapped into this market for the past three decades.

The fact that the company's most popular design is a dog emitting musical gas out of his backside sums up the the quirky larrikinism of the artists commissioned for the work, 

Dare Jennings established Mambo in Sydney in 1984 and appointed Wayne Golding as artistic director.

The dog emitting musical gas out of his backside is Mambo's biggest seller over the past 30 years. Richard Allan designed 'Farting Dog Call Of The Wild' in 1987

One of Reg Mombasa's most popular designs - Jesus handing out pies and beers at the football instead of loaves and fishes

The latest designs still have that equally quirky edge with one of many being Bananas in Balaclavas 

Sydney rock band Mental As Anything guitarist, Reg Mombassa, joined the team two years later and to this day remains one of the label’s best-selling artists.

Mombassa's most popular designs are the Aussie Jesus handing pies and beers out at the football instead of loaves and fishes and the 'Beer Tree' which was in the shape of Australia with native animals asleep after drinking too many cans.

'It became successful because of the interesting content - surf labels were pretty boring before Mambo,' he said.

'It developed a life of its own as an art movement - albeit a commercial one.'

Jennings and Golding left Mambo marking the end of the ‘Old School’ era of the label and signalling the beginning of its ‘New School’ period when Angus Kingsmill bought the brand in 2008.

Kingsmill said the clothing label stands out from the pack.

'It taps into the Australian sense of humour with talented artists with designs offers social comment - I'm not aware of any clothing label like it in the world,' he said.

'The great thing about Mambo is it never taken the fashion industry seriously and will poke fun at everything including themselves.'

The quirky theme seems to run through most of the Mambo items - this is a Jeff Raglus design 'Chariot Goddess' from 1993

The latest designs still have that equally quirky edge with Bananas in Balaclavas, Che Guevara in Mickey Mouse ears and a watermelon smoking a bong with the title: 'Never Lend A Watermelon Money'.

The designs are both politically incorrect - as well as political - with a classic example being the ‘Rednecks’ T-shirt in response to Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party. 

Profits from the sale of the T-shirt eventually enabled Mambo to hand over a cheque worth $100,000 to the National Aboriginal and Islander State Development Association, whose funding would have been placed in jeopardy had One Nation achieved a greater percentage of the vote.

Mambo: 30 years of shelf-indulgence is on at the The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia at Federation Square in Melbourne from 6 Dec 2014 – 22 Feb 2015.  Entry is free.
