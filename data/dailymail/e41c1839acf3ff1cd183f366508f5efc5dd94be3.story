A Californian couple who seem not to be fans of DIY have been arrested for kidnapping a handyman for seven hours and forcing him to do work on their home earlier this week,

Authorities in San Jose said the 50-year-old man's ordeal began on Monday morning when he was called to a five-bedroom home in the affluent suburb of Morgan Hill by Jason DeJesus, 36 and Chanelle Troedson, 33 and beaten until he performed 'minor repair work around the house.'

Held for almost seven hours until he managed to escape when the couple drove him to a gas station, the unidentified man was apparently told that he would be 'killed' unless he 'fixed some things around the house.'

DeJesus and Troedson are both now facing charges of false imprisonment, kidnapping, assault, criminal threats and conspiracy as a result of their actions, which stem from a disagreement two months ago.

'There was a dispute about services rendered,' said Santa Clara County Sheriff's Sgt. Jose Cardoza about the man's apparently uncompleted work. 'That in conjunction with him not being paid entirely.'

According to the police, the handyman was contacted on Monday morning and went despite his previous difficulties with the clients.

'The victim knew he was going somewhere associated with the previous person,' said Cardoza to Mercury News.

'But he had no clue there would be trouble. Nothing stuck out about what was to occur.'

'There was some back and forth with the original person and the victim wanted to get paid. Then DeJesus got involved,' said Cardoza.

'He contacted the victim and said,'Maybe we can work something out while you're done here. Why don't you do some work?'

When the alleged victim arrived at the luxury accommodation he was immediately assaulted and repeatedly threatened for several hours.

However, within minutes of arriving, he was allegedly assaulted by Troedson and 'for the next few hours he's assaulted and had his life threatened numerous times,' said Cardoza, who added that no weapons were used or recovered from the scene.

Authorities in San Jose said the 50-year-old man's ordeal began on Monday morning when he was called to a home in the affluent suburb of Morgan Hill by Chanelle Troedson, 33 and beaten until he performed 'minor repair work around the house.'

'He's also forced to do some minor repair work around the house.'

The 4,600 square foot home has five bedrooms and boasts a pool, a beach volleyball court and a tennis court.'

Some of the items the couple made him take care of included a dishwasher and a broken door.

'The victim was pretty terrified. He was pretty shaken up and scared by this whole incident,' said Cardoza.

'What he did tell investigators is that he was just trying to do what he was being told, wait for the opportunity to escape.'

At
around 5.30 p.m. DeJesus and Troedson drove the alleged victim to a gas
station on the way to another house they wanted him to work on.

Left alone in the truck, he made his escape and made it to a nearby home.

'A
blond-haired gentleman came to my door, knocked on the door frantically
asking if he could use my phone. Apparently, he said he'd been 
kidnapped and beaten and I could visibly see he had some injuries,' said
the witness.

Police arrived and soon apprehended the couple and handed them over to sheriff's deputies.

The
victim's injuries were not considered life threatening, but Cardoza 
said, 'that's not to say having your life threatened and being held 
against your will and physically assaulted is not serious.'

'We
don't know what the actual intent was. What was the ultimate plan once 
they go tot he second location what they were going to do.'

'No type of services, or disagreement, should ever get to this point where it gets violent.'

DeJesus, and Troedson are being held in the Santa Clara County jail and 
will be arraigned Thursday, at which point they will be assigned legal 
counsel, police said.
