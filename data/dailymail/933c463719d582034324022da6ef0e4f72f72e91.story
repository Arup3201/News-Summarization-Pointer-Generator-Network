A woman who survived a shotgun attack by her jealous husband but then lost her son to suicide has revealed how she had suffered domestic violence for 18 years.

As she launched a campaign to help victims of domestic violence, Rachel WIlliams said: 'I was in an absuive relationship for 18 years that began when I was only 17.'

Rachel  was shot in the leg at point blank range when estranged husband Darren burst into the hairdressers in Newport, South Wales, where she was working.

Mrs Williams survived the 2011 attack, but her husband then killed himself. Their son Jack, 16, was found hanged just weeks later.

Now Mrs Williams has joined forces with a domestic violence charity, and is calling for children to be educated on healthy relationships in school in the hope it will prevent a similar tragedy.

'I was about 19 and seven months pregnant when Darren was first violent with me. He lifted me off the floor by my throat and didn’t drop me until I was blue in the face.

'After he would hurt me Darren would apologise and tell me he loved me, that he couldn’t live without me and that he would kill himself if I left.

'I didn’t know any different. Domestic violence was all I’d known.'

Mrs Williams, pictured with husband Darren on their wedding day, says he was first violent towards her when she was 19, and seven months pregnant 

The inquest into the death of Mrs Williams's son Jack was told the teenager (pictured) had been struggling to deal with his parents' break-up and had tried to remain 'neutral'

The violence continued for the next 18 years, until in 2011, 46-year-old Darren Williams stormed Carol Ann's Hair Stylist armed with a sawn-off shotgun after hearing his estranged wife had been having an affair, the 2013 inquest into his death was told.

She was shot in the knee and two customers were injured, but Mrs Williams, then 41, was able to wrestle the gun from Mr Williams, a 6ft 7in, 20st former bouncer, who fled the scene.

His body was found in woodland shortly afterwards.

Just five weeks later, Mrs Williams's youngest son Jack, hanged himself at the same spot, after going to visit his father's ashes. 

Jack's inquest was told the teenager had been struggling to deal with his parents' break-up and had tried to remain 'neutral'.

But the hearing was told that relations between the mother's and father's sides of the family broke down after the shooting, and that Jack had gone to live with his father's sister.  

Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner David Bowen said of Jack: 'This is such a tragic death and his death should never have occurred.'

'If my children had been taught about healthy relationships in school maybe they would have realised what was happening at home wasn’t normal,' Mrs Williams said.

'Maybe they would have spoken to their teachers about what was happening in their home.

'I needed help to leave my husband, perhaps that would have happened early if there had been earlier intervention.

Mrs Williams is working with the Wales Violence Against Women Action Group to encourage the Welsh Assembly to reintroduce compulsory education on healthy relationships

'Education could have helped my sons. And it can help young women too. They need to be taught to see the signs of domestic abuse so they can leave before things go to far.'

Now in a new relationship with a man she describes as the 'total opposite to Darren', Mrs Williams is working with the Wales Violence Against Women Action Group to encourage the Welsh Assembly to reintroduce compulsory education as part of Violence Against Women Bill, due to go before politicians this week.

The group wants one staff member in every school to receive specialist training on domestic violence, sexual bullying, consent, female genital mutilation and forced marriage, which was originally included in the bill when it was first introduced last year but has since been removed. 

'There needs to be a strong program taught in schools to show children exactly what a healthy relationship looks like and what domestic abuse is and how it starts,' Mrs Williams said.

'A program like that could save lives because women are dying every week from domestic violence.'
