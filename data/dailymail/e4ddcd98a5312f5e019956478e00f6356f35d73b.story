A husband and wife have been found dead of gunshot wounds in their Connecticut home in an apparent murder-suicide.

Authorities responded to a report of a shooting at the couple's Bristol home Wednesday morning and found 26-year-old Alexander Ryng and 27-year-old Kyla Ryng dead inside.

Police say the Ryngs' three children, ages four, three and 20 months, also were in the home but were unharmed.

Heading for divorce: The couple had been married for almost six years by Kyla Ryng had just days before the shootings filed for divorce from Alex Ryng

Family home: The Ryngs' three children were home at the time of the shooting and two of them alerted neighbors that 'something bad' had happened at home

State court records show Kyla Ryng filed for divorce from Alex Ryng on May 30.

Five days later, police were called to the home at 73 Henderson St at 7:15am Wednesday by neighbors who were alerted by two of the Ryngs' children that 'something bad' had happened.

Police say their preliminary investigation indicated that the deaths may have been a murder-suicide.

Kyla Ryng's Facebook page stated that she was a 'Full-time stay at home mommy & wife, and I love it.'

Alexander Ryng was a first lieutenant in the Connecticut Army National Guard.

According to the Courant, Kyla Ryng said in court documents that the marriage had 'broken down irretrievably.' She requested that the couple's property be divided and that she receive alimony and child support.

Domestic violence: The pair had three children aged four, three and 20 months who may have witnessed the killings. They are now being cared for by family members

Mysterious: The couple look happy in snaps posted to their Facebook accounts, and police had not previously been called to their home for domestic disturbances, but Kyla Ryng had filed for divorce just days before her death

She wanted joint custody of the children, but for their primary residence to be with her.

According to WFSB, the couple had been married for almost six years.

In a press conference late Wednesday afternoon, Bristol police Chief Thomas Grimaldi said Alexander Ryng legally purchased the weapon used in the shooting.

High school students waiting for a school bus nearby described hearing a woman screaming and then three bangs followed by a slamming house and then silence.

Neighbor Nancy Gagne told the Courant that she saw law enforcement officials and a priest enter the home.

'I'm sick about the kids, what they saw,' she said.

The children are now being cared for by family members.
