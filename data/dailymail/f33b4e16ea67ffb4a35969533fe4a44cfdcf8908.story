The electric car being showcased as a replacement for horse-drawn carriage rides in New York's Central Park has been revealed.

The Horseless eCarriage, a classic looking motor with leather seats, running boards and green livery, was shown off at the New York International Auto Show on Thursday.

Although it is advocated as a humane alternative to the horses that have been taking tourists round the park for decades, the eCarriage has not yet won over critics.

The prototype of the car was commissioned by campaign group NYCLASS, which claims horse-drawn carriage rides in such a busy city are cruel.

The group's proposed alternative is an open-top car that can seat eight people and is made to look like it is from the early 20th Century, with plenty of brass trimmings and over-sized wheels.

Its creator, Jason Wenig of car restoration business The Creative Workshop, said the selling price could be between $150,000 and $175,000.

Wenig called the car 'a homage' to an earlier time, with a body shape that 'reflects and celebrates an era that's of amazing historical significance to this city'.

But before the cars could make their way to the streets around Central Park, legislation banning the carriage horses would have to be passed.

Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to ban the 
horses. But carriage-horse operators and their allies - including actor 
Liam Neeson - have opposed the plan, and the council has not yet 
introduced the legislation.

Neeson, who has lived in the city for 20
 years, defended the 'proud' workers and their spotless 
record for looking after their animals.

In
 a strongly-worded piece in the New York Times recently, he stated that 
'an entire way of life and a historic industry are under threat'.

The
 actor went on to defend the safety record of the handlers and their 
horses, saying: 'New Yorkâ€™s horse carriages have made an estimated six 
million trips in traffic over the last 30 years.

'In that time, just four horses have been killed as a result of collisions with motor vehicles, with no human fatalities.'

The Central Park Conservancy, a nonprofit that oversees the park in partnership with the city, was also against the idea of bringing more cars into the popular place.

'Forty million people visit Central Park each year, including runners, bicyclists, kids and dog owners,' Doug Blonsky, president and chief executive of the conservancy, said.

'Adding vehicles to the mix will make the park less safe for all of them and increase congestion.'

Wenig said the cars would be able to go up to 30mph outside of the park, but would be kept electronically from going more than 5mph inside it.

Asked about the conservancy's opposition, de Blasio said he thought it was a 'misunderstanding' of what's being proposed.

Moving on: Those backing the campaign say the eCarriage, which will not travel faster than 5mph, is a safer and more humane way to take in views of the park

'Right now, besides the fact that the horse carriages are not humane - there have been a number of accidents involving carriages - the routes we're talking about would be the same as our existing routes,' he said.

'You're talking about electric cars for tourists that go slow on purpose because they should go slow and because tourists want to see things.

'That's very different from other issues about cars in parks, and it is a cleaner, better, more humane approach, that obviously will also provide employment opportunities and will be good for our tourism industry.'

He had previously called the rides cruel and outdated, and said they should no longer be 'a part of the 
landscape of New York City'.

City Councilmember Daniel Dromm said legislation was still being crafted, with the specifics of how those who hold licenses for the carriage horses could get the vehicles and how it would be paid for still to be determined. He insisted there were enough votes for legislation to pass.
