On nights as dramatic as this, the temptation is to start with the match-winner and go from there. This is no exception.

At the final whistle Chelsea’s manager Jose Mourinho marched across the turf to seek out Petr Cech and throw his arms tightly around the Chelsea goalkeeper in a bear hug. Mourinho knows. And so do we.

Without Cech between the posts against Everton, who knows whether Willian would have gone on to score Chelsea’s corkscrew winner in the 89th minute.

More on Cech in a minute because his performance against Roberto Martinez’s team is worthy of much more than a few token sentences in his honour.

Everton lost this fixture because for one moment, one crazy moment, they failed to re-organise when Gareth Barry was sent off.

In the pushing, the shoving and the shouting match that followed, Branislav Ivanovic almost throttled substitute James McCarthy, and then pushed his forehead into the side of the Everton player’s head.

But that was not the most damaging allegation laid at Ivanovic’s door. The question being asked on social media about the Serbian was: did he actually bite McCarthy?

It is an amazing charge considering it was Ivanovic who was bitten by Liverpool striker Luis Suarez two years ago. But because this is Chelsea, because this is Mourinho, the repercussions and the recriminations for Ivanovic’s actions are likely to last for days.

Romelu Lukaku had an excellent chance to break the deadlock, but saw his effort saved by Petr Cech

That is sad, because we should be celebrating a masterful performance by Cech. Chelsea won this game, their 18th in the league this season, because Cech saved brilliantly twice, once in each half, from the feet of Romelu Lukaku.

For the first, he threw out a left leg to deflect Lukaku’s effort wide of his post when Ross Barkley had split the Chelsea defence.

He had to be on his game again in the second half when Lukaku, unmarked six yards out, should have put Everton in front. Cech’s save was breathtaking.

Thibaut Courtois will be sweating ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain. It is no longer clear cut who is No 1. ‘He touched the ball twice, he was a spectator,’ said Mourinho. ‘This is what we need — competition with Petr and Courtois. The focus must be permanent and also a keeper can be tired — it can affect your nervous system. Petr worked hard and I believed he was the best option because John Terry was ill in the morning. I wanted leadership.’

This was a functional Chelsea performance, an average game against average opposition. Willian’s finish was stunning, reading Tim Howard’s punched clearance and twisting his body to send his angled drive beyond the Everton keeper’s near post.

It did not help Martinez’s mood that the man who headed the Cesc Fabregas free kick into the penalty area was that man Ivanovic. Was he was lucky to be on the pitch? ‘Don’t make me laugh,’ claimed Mourinho when he was quizzed about the incident with McCarthy.

The FA will decide upon the next course of action. The referee had 101 things to think about as players from both sides puffed out their chests. From the free-kick Chelsea scored a goal that keeps Manchester City at arm’s length in the title race. To Willian’s credit, it was a stunning finish.

‘When I have won titles in the past, there are always a couple of games when you win in the last minute,’ admitted Mourinho.

They could easily have been ahead in the first half, particularly when Steven Naismith’s bizarre ball- juggling act in the Everton penalty area went unpunished.

This was a frustrating evening for Chelsea, one of those games they will be glad to have got out of the way. Eden Hazard was their chief threat and poor Muhamed Besic had to be replaced by McCarthy at half-time having been booked for a foul on the Belgian.

McCarthy then did a decent job of spoiling in midfield, but eventually Willian rescued Chelsea with his powerful strike from the edge of the area. 

Undoubtedly, it was the save of the season so far.

Petr Cech was preferred to Thibaut Courtois in Chelsea’s. Jose Mourinho probably wouldn’t call it a dropping, but that’s what it seemed like. Courtois took his place on the bench, suggesting there was no injury to the Belgian. With the Champions League clash against PSG on the horizon, on Tuesday to be exact, it’ll be interesting to see who the Special One plumps for. Mourinho has enough time to think about his decision with Chelsea without a game this weekend following their shock FA Cup exit to Bradford.

Ray Wilkins was at the Bridge to watch the club he served as a player and coach. He was sat just behind the dug-outs. Perhaps it rekindled memories of his bygone days in the Blues technical area under Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guus Hiddink and Carlo Ancelotti.

If Jose Mourinho told his charges to keep a particular eye on Everton midfielder Steven Naysmith, here’s why. Ahead of the encounter, the Scotland international had scored in three of his last four Premier League appearances against the Blues. It would had been Naysmith’s handball in the first-half that caught Mourinho’s eye, though.
