Jailed: Ellie Feghaly raped the woman after tricking her male companion into getting out of the cab to ask for directions

An unlicensed minicab driver who raped a female passenger after tricking her male companion to get out of the car and ask for directions has been jailed for nine years.

Ellie Feghaly, 44, had picked up the 33-year-old victim and her friend in central London after they left a bar in Leicester Square in August last year.

The pair thought he was a legitimate driver and got in to share the journey home.

But on the way Feghaly became increasingly aggressive and clearly did not know where he was going.

He then stopped at a Texaco garage in Shadwell, east London, and suggested the victim's male friend got out to ask for directions.

As soon as he left Ferghaly drove off, locking all the doors and preventing her escape.

He drove to a car park a short distance away where he raped her on the backseat.

The victim eventually struggled free and alerted a passer-by to her ordeal.

Her male friend, who had been frantically trying to call her on her mobile phone, then managed to find her.

The woman reported the rape the next day and Feghaly was tracked down from his DNA profile.

Three days later he was arrested and subsequently charged.

Sexual predator: Feghaly denied rape but was found guilty by a jury at Woolwich Crown Court and jailed for nine years

Feghaly, of Perivale, Middlesex, 
denied rape but was convicted by a jury at Woolwich Crown Court 
following a trial and sentenced to nine years in jail today.

Detective
 Constable Peter Thompson from the Metropolitan Police, said: 'This man 
used violence in order to carry out this attack. He was operating as an 
unlicensed mini-cab driver in Central London.

'The
 victim had trusted that she would get to her destination safely. 
However this sexual predator subjected her to this horrific attack 
despite her pleas for him to stop.

'I hope that the sentence handed down by the judge goes some way in helping the victim recover from this ordeal.'

Hard-hitting: A poster from the 'Cabwise' campaign advising women not to take unbooked or unlicensed minicabs

In London alone, 11 women are attacked each month after getting into unlicensed minicabs.

Around 80 per cent of stranger rapes are committed by unlicensed cab drivers.

The Mayor of London launched a hard-hitting Transport for London (TfL) campaign last year in a bid to cut the large number of women being sexually attacked by unlicensed minicab drivers.

'Cabwise' featured a series of posters, adverts and a free-to-download app which provides a quick and easy way to book a licensed taxi.

Users can also text 60835 and they will be sent three numbers for local cab firms.

Revellers are also advised of the following tips on how to stay safe when using minicabs:
