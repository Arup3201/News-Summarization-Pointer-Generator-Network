She may have sprained her ankle skiing in Italy at the end of last year but Crown Princess Victoria didn't let her injury stop her from carrying out her duties.

The 36-year-old arrived at the city hall in Hamburg, Germany, today alongside her 40-year-old husband Prince Daniel - and was still hobbling along on crutches with her foot in a brace.

The royals are with an economic delegation on a two-day trip to Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Essen.

Despite wearing a leg brace, Princess 
Victoria still oozed glamour and poise in a flattering cream dress, on-trend black boucle jacket and eye-catching jewellery.

She wore her hair slicked back and showcased a healthy and radiant glow as she posed for photographers on her crutches.

Last fortnight she joined her 40-year-old husband at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm to present the Tobias Prize 2014.

She wore her hair slicked back as she presented the award to Sten Eirik W.Jacobsen, winner of the Tobias Prize 2014.

The Tobias Foundation established the Tobias Prize in 2008. It consists of a personal prize of 100,000 Swedish Krona (Â£9369) and a research grant of 2 million Swedish Krona (Â£187,396) per annum for five years.

Its main aim is to give the laureate the means to carry out high-class research concerning problems of importance for cell therapy in hematological (blood-related) disorders.

Princess Victoria sprained her ankle in the Italian Alpine resort of Cervinia on Monday December 30.

She
 was holidaying there with family members including her husband, Prince 
Daniel and their toddler daughter Estelle when the incident occurred.

She was taken by private helicopter to a hospital in Geneva, Switzerland, where doctors X-rayed her foot to assess the damage.

'The crown princess suffered a sprain 
in the foot but is feeling otherwise well,' the royal palace said in a 
brief statement afterwards.

A
 spokeswoman at the time insisted that the injury would not affect 
Victoria's public commitments in the New Year â€“ and she was right.

On New Year's Eve she was seen back on the snow walking around with the aid of the leg brace and crutches.
