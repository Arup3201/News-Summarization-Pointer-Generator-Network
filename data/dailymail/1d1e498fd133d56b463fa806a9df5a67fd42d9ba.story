George W. Bush fully authorized the torture of terror suspects, CIA officials have claimed, furiously dismissing accusations that the intelligence agency's so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' took place without the knowledge of the then-U.S. President.

An anonymous spokesman said the CIA's campaign or torturing suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban operatives, which was revealed in a Senate Committee report on Tuesday, was 'a presidential programme, authorised, co-ordinated and administered through the White House.'

The CIA fight came as Bush's former Vice President Dick Cheney branded the Senate report a 'terrible piece of work' that is 'deeply flawed', adding his voice to the claim that not only was Bush 'fully informed' of the programme, he authorized it.

'The report's full of cr**,' Cheney told Fox News host Bret Baier on Wednesday evening.

Dismissal: The CIA fight came as Bush's former Vice President Dick Cheney branded the Senate report a 'terrible piece of work' that is 'deeply flawed'

Dick Cheney said it is 'not true' that President Bush didn't know that aggressive interrogation techniques were being used on terrorism suspects until four years into the program.

Furthermore, the CIA never tortured anyone under the legal definition of the word, as asserted by Department of Justice lawyers at the time, he said.

The retired politician, who said it was his job in the administration to oversee programs like the one used by the CIA, said the government agency's actions were 'justified' and he 'do it again in a minute' in order to save American lives.

According to an anonymous CIA official, Bush was fully informed of the intelligence agency's torture programme, and had in fact authorized its use.

Speaking to the Times, the spokesman also identified a number of other senior Bush administration officials he claims ordered and approved the 'enhanced interrogation' programme that led to 119 Al Qaeda suspects being tortured with techniques such as waterboarding.

The official said those in the know included: Cheney, Bush's legal adviser Alberto Gonzales; National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice; Stephen Hadley, her deputy; Attorney General John Ashcroft; and several attorneys in the Justice Department.

He said that neither Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld nor Secretary of State Colin Powell were officially informed of the CIA torture programme.

Claims that Bush was aware of the programme were reinforced by Cheney in an interview with Fox News Wednesday evening.

The former U.S. President fully authorized the brutal torture of terror suspects, CIA officials said today, furiously dismissing accusations that the intelligence agency's so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' took place without the knowledge

The former U.S. Vice President said it is 'not true' that Bush didn't know that aggressive interrogation techniques were being used on terrorism suspects until four years into the program.

'Read his book,' Cheney told Baier. 'He talks about it extensively in his memoirs. He was in fact an integral party of the program. He had to approve it before we went forward with it.'

According to a CIA spokesperson, a number of high-ranking members of the Bush administration were informed of the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation' programme. 

These include:

George Bush - President of the United States

Dick Cheney - Vice President of the United States

Alberto Gonzales - Bush's legal advisor

Condoleezza Rice - National Security Adviser

Stephen Hadley - Deputy National Security Adviser

John Ashcroft - United States Attorney General

Several attorneys in the United States Justice Department. 

Cheney said Bush was focused on a number of other issues at the time, but 'I think that he knew everything he needed to know and wanted to know about the program,' including the fact that prisoners were being waterboarded.

'There no effort on our part to keep him from that' information Cheney said, contrary to the claims made in the Senate report.

'So the notion that the committee's trying to peddle that somehow the agency was operating on a rogue basis and we weren't being told or the president wasn't being told, is just a flat out lie,' he stated.

What really happened, Cheney said, is 'we asked the agency to go take steps and put in place programs that were designed to catch the ba****** who killed 3,000 of us on 9/11, and to make sure it didn't happen again, and that's actually what they did.'

The former second in command said that the CIA operatives who ran the detention and interrogation program 'deserve a lot of credit,' not the 'condemnation' they are receiving from Senate Democrats who authorized yesterday's controversial report.

Cheney admitted that 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times but he said that did not constitute torture.

'What are we supposed to do? Kiss him on both cheeks and say, please, please tell us what you know?' Cheney said. 'Of course not. We did exactly what needed to be done in order to catch those who were guilty on 9/11 and to prevent a further attack, and we were successful on both parts.' 

The Bush era vice presidents said that the CIA only used techniques on terrorism suspects that it used on its own operatives as part of their training and that includes waterboarding. 

He admitted that rectal feeding, a process the CIA files revealed by the Senate say detainees were submitted to, was not one of the 12 techniques approved by the White House.

But he then said: 'What are you prepared to do to get information about future attacks on the United States?'

'In terms of there being some problems in the program, there may have well have been...but I don't think the Senate report represents the truth of what actually happened,' he said.

Cheney said he hadn't read the entire 6,000-page document that the Senate's redacted paper was based on nor had he read the full 500-page declassified summary released by the Intelligence Committee yesterday.

Upon learning that one of the interrogation subjects died, Cheney said, 'I have no sympathy for them,' again reminding Baier that al Qaeda killed 3,000 Americans on 9/11.

He later told the Fox News that Americans have to remember that al Qaeda was reportedly trying to get their hands on nuclear weapons after the assault on American soil and there were anthrax attacks occurring at the time.

'There was every reason to expect' that there was going to be a follow-up terrorist attack, as well, he said. 

The CIA 'did one hell of a job, and they deserve our gratitude,' an unapologetic Cheney said.
