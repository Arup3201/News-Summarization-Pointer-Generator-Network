Jeremy Paxman announced last month he is quitting the current affairs show Newsnight and it seems he is determined to make his final month the most explosive of them all.

Tonight the presenter will stun Silvio Berlusconi when he asks the former Italian prime minister whether he did call Angela Merkel an ‘an un****able lard-a***?’.

The disgraced politician was accused in 2011 of insulting his fellow European leader during a conversation with a newspaper editor.

Tonight the presenter will stun Silvio Berlusconi when he asks the former Italian prime minister whether he did call Angela Merkel an 'an un****able lard-a***?'

The alleged remarks were picked up by investigators probing a £660,000 blackmail plot against Berlusconi.

It was not the first time the Italian leader was accused of insulting the chancellor.

In 2009 he kept Mrs Merkel waiting at a summit while he chatted on his mobile telephone.

The year before he ‘jumped’ out at her from behind a statue and shouted ‘peek a boo’ when she arrived in Italy for an official visit.

In tonight's programme Paxman will ask Berlusconi: 'Is it true you called Angela Merkel an ‘unf*ckable lard-arse?’

The clip stops just short of Berlusconi's reply who looks completely dumbstruck.

Berlusconi was found guilty of tax fraud in 2013, sentenced to four years in prison and lost his Senate seat as a result.

However, he was spared prison as in Italy criminals over 70 rarely go to jail.

Earlier this month the 77-year-old completed his first day of community service at an old people’s home as part of his sentence for tax fraud.

As the disgraced former Italian prime minister arrived at the Catholic-run facility in Cesano Boscone, near Milan, one protester wearing a clown hat shouted: ‘You should be in prison!’

Berlusconi has been ordered to work four-hour shifts once a week for a year after being found guilty in 2013 of tax fraud in the acquisition of TV rights to films.

His tasks at the care home include entertaining Alzheimer’s patients and helping them with meals.

The billionaire media mogul, who has dominated Italian politics for two decades, is leading his Forza Italia party’s campaign for the European elections despite being barred from standing as an MEP.

Berlusconi was ordered to perform four hours of community service a week after his four-year sentence was reduced to one by a general amnesty.

He also lost his Senate seat because of the conviction, but remains an important political force as head of his Forza Italia party.

Paxman announced last month he would be retiring. In a statement he said: 'I have decided it is time to move on from Newsnight.

'After 25 years, I should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people.'
