Scuba diving is the perfect way to witness the underwater world up close.

But one diver got more than he bargained for when an eager remora fish - also know as a suckerfish - attached itself to his wetsuit.

Snorre E. Johnsen was swimming off Australia's northeastern shores when the remora fish attached itself dangerously close to his crotch area. 

Wearing a 2-3mm wetsuit, the diver manages to signal to his friend to use his GoPro camera to capture the fish on camera.

Although it didn't hurt, the diver admits he could definitely feel the suction through his wetsuit.

'As you can see from the video, I wasn't scared for my nuts,' diver Snorre E. Johnsen told MailOnline.

'Prior to that dive I'd experienced plenty of cool stuff and fishy things; there is always new experiences and interesting things that you never see above water,' he said.

The remora fish latched on while Mr Johnsen was diving at the Moltke wreck, off Magnetic Island in Queensland, Australia.

Mr Johnsen is certainly no inexperienced diver, either: he's dived in northern and southern Australia, Thailand, Greece, Spain, Norway, Malta and the Spanish party island of Ibiza over the past five years.

Norwegian diver Mr Johnsen claims that this wasn't even his most 'epic' diving experience - citing the SS Yongala wreck dive site, also in northern Queensland, as the best experience he's had while diving.

'No other dive site on earth is that crowded with huge animals,' he said of the SS Yongala wreckage.
