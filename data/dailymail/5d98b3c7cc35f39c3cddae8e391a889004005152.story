His day in court: Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson testified at a grand jury investigating his shooting of an unarmed teenager

The Missouri police officer who caused a national furor when he shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown has testified in front of a grand jury investigating whether he should face criminal charges.

Darren Wilson, who shot 18-year-old Brown six times in Ferguson, Missouri, emerged from hiding on Wednesday to appear in front of a St. Louis County grand jury.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Wilson was 'cooperative,' he though he was not legally obligated to appear in front of the panel. 

Prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch convened the grand jury to determine whether there is enough evidence to charge Wilson with a crime for killing Brown.

McCulloch on Wednesday announced that if the grand jury finds no cause to file charges against Wilson, he will order the immediate release of audio recordings and transcripts of the proceedings.

Grand juries normally conduct their business in secret to protect sensitive investigative details. However, the case has garnered so much attention that McColloch wants to allow the public to see all the details.

'We just want to be more open,' a spokesman said.

Wilson has told investigators he he opened fire after Brown assaulted him and tried to grab his gun. He said he believed he was justified in using deadly force. 

However, Brown's friend, who was with him moment before the shooting, says Brown had his hands up and was surrendering when Wilson shot him dead in the street. 

The shooting infuriated residents in predominately black Ferguson took to the streets in protest. The heavy-handed response by the overwhelmingly white Ferguson Police Department kicked off a national conversation about race and the use of police force.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times by Officer Wilson in the middle of a Ferguson, Missouri, street. His death prompted outrage in the community and resulted in several investigations

Reports that Brown was gunned down while he was surrendering with his hands in the air led to massive protests in Ferguson - with many activists shouting 'hands up, don't shoot'

When Wilson's name was released publicly, he and his family fled their home and went into hiding, fearing reprisal from violent activists.

McCulloch announced a grand jury would investigate the shooting and determine whether or not Wilson was within the bounds of the law when he opened fire.

However, many black community activists have said McCulloch's judgement is already biased. His father, a police officer, was killed by a black suspect in the 1960s.

The federal Justice Department has launched its own investigation of the shooting - as well as an investigation of the department's history of race relations.
