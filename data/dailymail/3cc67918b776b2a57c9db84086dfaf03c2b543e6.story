An Arizona man was faced with a nightmare of a hospital bill after slipping and hitting his head in his bathroom.

Scott Richardson had just stepped out of the shower on Valentine’s Day, and didn't wake up until almost two weeks later when he was faced with a $150,000 hospital bill.

The 65-year-old lawyer from Scottsdale smacked his head on the bathroom floor and was taken to the Mayo Clinic Hospital close to his house.

Nothing to drink to: Scott Richardson, 65, was faced with a bill for $150,000 after spending two weeks in a hospital that wasn't covered by his health insurance. His wife Holly, right, had been assured by hospital staff that all bills would be paid for

He was diagnosed with a bleeding ulcer that led to anemia, which caused him to pass out.

12 days after being admitted he was transferred to another hospital in the area before beginning a program of rehabilitation.

Not giving up: Mr Richardson tried to negotiate with his insurer, Blue Cross, but was told he would have to settle his bill with the Mayo Clinic directly

The surprise bill came about because the Mayo Clinic was not in his insurer’s network.

From the second he was in the ambulance to the emergency room and the intensive care unit, the clock was ticking and charges were racking up.

‘This is not anything anyone would 
want to go through. It might have been easier if you did not have 
insurance,’ Mr Richardson said in an interview with AZCentral last week. ‘I don’t remember Mayo. I was in the ICU for almost two weeks.’

His wife, Holly, was at his bedside throughout his recover and was told not to worry about the medical costs.

Professionals
assured her that even though the hospital was out of network, they were
protected under a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment 
and Labor Act (EMTALA).

The
law was  passed in 1986 to prevent hospitals from refusing to treat 
patients without insurance, but it doesn’t force insurers to cover 
costs, including when patients are admitted to hospitals without their 
consent or knowledge.Although Mr Richardson’s insurer, Blue 
Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, paid for most of the bills and gave him 
reimbursement checks for $30,000, he still faced a balance of $120,000 
that he was told to settle directly with the Mayo Clinic.

The clinic offered to reduce the bill by 20 per cent and organise a payment plan for him. It would have left him paying around $94,000.

‘When an individual comes to Mayo Clinic in a medical emergency, Mayo provides all the necessary care to stabilize and treat patients, regardless of their insurance status,’ Mayo spokeswoman Lynn Closway said in a statement.

‘A patient’s health-benefit plan is determined by their insurance and may provide limited coverage for out-of-network care. Mayo works with all patients to provide guidance and options regarding their insurance coverage.’

Desert surprise: Mr Richardson was taken the the Mayo clinic because it was close to his house. He never considered that he would not be covered by his insurance company or the federal EMTALA law that covers emergency surgery

Mr Richardson said that paying off the bill in full would be financially devastating and it left a bitter taste after paying premiums for years.

A lawyer by trade, despite not knowing about EMTALA before going into hospital he looked into the law enough to know that he should have been covered.

Upon calling Blue Cross to attempt to reason with the insurance company he said that it like talking to a brick wall with associates unable to explain what he was covered for under the plan. Most of the representatives he spoke with also had no idea about the federal law or whether it even applied in his case.

‘Seventy-five percent of the people I talked to didn’t know what EMTALA was,’ he said. ‘The number of people I talked to who didn’t even know how to spell EMTALA was scary.’

Blue Cross officials defended their so-called ignorance by pointing out the complex nature of health plans and the law surrounding them. They maintain that it would be impossible for every customer service operator to know about every possible scenario.

‘We understand these are difficult issues,’ said Deanna Salazar, senior vice president and general counsel of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona to AZ Central. ‘We go above and beyond to make sure our customers get what they expect from their plans.’

Power of the press: It was only after local media got involved that the Mayo Clinic decided to drop the charges however the hospital maintain hat such media pressure had nothing to do with it

The newspaper and local Phoenix television station got in touch after one of Mr Richardson’s children who works for the local television station put the case on the news.

Suddenly, the charges vanished and his $118,000 bill was erased.

Blue Cross officials would not discuss the negotiation process nor reveal how the charges were resolved.

They would also not share the information with Richardson, saying they do not discuss pricing, however they insist that it was nothing to do with the media’s involvement.

‘Just because patients get bills from a hospital doesn’t mean that’s what they should pay, Salazar said. ‘We can negotiate. We did it on his behalf ... We negotiated so he would have no residual amount owed to Mayo. We view this as a very positive result.’

Mr Richardson is overjoyed by the outcome but he is now worried was would happen to other people who would not have the same access to the media as him.

‘‘What really troubles me, as someone familiar with this field, is what does the average person do?’ he pondered.
