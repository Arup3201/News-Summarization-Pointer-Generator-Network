Is there any sport better at self-criticism than Formula One?

Here we are barely 24 hours after watching one of the greatest drivers ever to turn a wheel, Lewis Hamilton, winning the Australian Grand Prix in the most advanced car ever devised, yet some people have already applied the match to the paraffin.

Nobody sane would suggest that Sunday's race was the most thrilling ever staged, but to call for rule changes to condense the field is ludicrously premature.

I remember when, in 2010, refuelling was done away with and the season started with a horrific bore in Bahrain. Calls for the immediate rewriting of the regulations followed then, too. That urge was resisted and a fine season unfolded: four drivers contested the final round.

Even last year, with Mercedes dominant, there were some memorable races – the best of them, this time, in Bahrain, with heart-in-your-mouth, wheel-to-wheel scrapping throughout the field.

We should also provide some perspective. For most of the sport’s history, the field was far more spread out than now. Laps upon lap, minute upon minute, were not uncommon gaps in the oily-rag days of yore. Sir Stirling Moss, for example, beat his nearest challenger, Mike Hawthorn, by 5min 12.75sec to win the 1958 Portuguese Grand Prix.

You cannot legislate to make every grand prix interesting any more than you can make every football match interesting. Or every boxing match, or every athletics race. Thank goodness, too, because the thrill of sport would be diminished if we arrived knowing what to expect.

Yet, unlike in football, Formula One feels an insatiable need to reinvent itself to ‘improve the show’. The navel-gazing is totally boring and counterproductive.

It is also mostly self-serving. Teams cry for changes when they are failing to match their opponents, as Red Bull’s Christian Horner did in calling for Mercedes to have their grunt reined in. Toto Wolff responded by telling Horner and the rest to get their ‘f****** heads down and work hard’.

Yes, is Formula One not about striving for the best, winning the arms’ race and getting your super-rich rewards?

In passing, it is worth pointing out that the teams are far too powerful. The FIA, now presided over by Jean Todt, should surely be leading Formula One rather than following the consensus.

If the sport does need an injection of competitiveness, we look to Nico Rosberg to play his part by challenging Hamilton in a way he did not manage in Melbourne.

Last year see-sawed until Hamilton took near total command towards the end, and there is no reason to believe that Rosberg may not get the better of Hamilton at some stages this year. 

But for now we should celebrate the brilliance of Hamilton and his Mercedes machine, and stop moaning.

Red Bull chief Christian Horner is concerned that Mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport

Red Bull’s motorsport adviser Helmut Marko has warned, not for the first time, that the drinks company is considering leaving Formula One because the rules are not to their liking.

This threat should be wafted away. It probably is not genuine, but, even if it is, so what?

Global companies such as Mercedes, Toyota and Honda use the platform of Formula One to promote themselves so long as their boardrooms see an advantage in doing so. Then, when it no suits them, they suddenly stop. It is nothing to do with the regulations or the state of the sport.

Understanding that is crucial to knowing there is no point bending over backwards to pacify transient visitors.

Some wagging paddock tongues suggest that Manor never intended to race here in Australia. The suggestion is that they simply flew over the team and cars and parts to make it seem as if they would.

Why? They stand to get £28million in prize money by fulfilling their obligations to be in attendance, at least. (They have missed three races – at the end of last season – and cannot miss another under the terms of their contract.)

Manor deny the accusation. They say a software problem caused their unavoidable 11th hour withdrawal, adding that they have not saved a penny by not taking part, having bought the fares and paid their staff in any case.

Manor’s revival, after the team previously known as Marussia went into administration last autumn, has been widely seen as a tonic for Formula One, beset by the overspending of the less successful teams (my interpretation), or by the iniquitous way it the sport is run (the popular narrative).

However, it is unsettling that Manor, backed by OVO Energy entrepreneur Stephen Fitzpatrick, are paying just 1.3p in the pound to creditors.

It is no doubt reassuring for Manor’s staff to know that the self-made Graeme Lowdon, sporting director of the old Marussia team and the new Manor team, is an experienced businessman.

He made about £3.5million when a previous business of which he was a director, the internet group J2C, closed amid the global technology crash in the early 2000s.

Also among the lucky few was Alan Donnelly – Labour’s one-time leader in the European Parliament and a close adviser to former FIA president Max Mosley – who collected £400,000 for his £1,250 stake.

Investors who bought shares when the company floated, shortly before its shares peaked, did considerably less well.

One shareholder said at the time of J2C’s closure: ‘It seems unfair that the directors should be rewarded quite so well for failure.’

Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, it was gratifying to note Lewis Hamilton’s contribution to Mercedes’ post-qualifying press conference.

He stood at the back, put his hand up and said to his team boss Toto Wolff: ‘From the Daily Mail, is there any news on the contract?’

Wolff: ‘No news on the contract, to the Daily Mail journalist.’

I am happy to swap salaries with Lewis. Yet while I don’t know if he could do my job, I know I could not do his.
