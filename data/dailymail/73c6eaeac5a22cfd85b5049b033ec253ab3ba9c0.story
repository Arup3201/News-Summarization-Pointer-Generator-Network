Michelle Knight today said that she understands the decision of her son's new family not to share with the 14-year-old the identity of his birth mother.Â 

Miss Knight's son Joey was given up for adoption during her 11 years held in captivity by Ariel Castro at his Cleveland home.

The 33-year-old told the Today show on Monday that she has photographs of her son that his new family had shared with her and that she was happy to see all that he had accomplished. She added that she hoped to be reunited with him one day.

Cleveland kidnapping victim Michelle Knight speaks with Savannah Guthrie on the Today show one day before the year anniversary of her escape from Ariel Castro's Cleveland home

Michelle Knight, pictured during an interview earlier this week, released a memoir on the anniversary of her escape, in which she describes the physical and mental abuse she suffered at the hands of Ariel Castro for 11 years

Miss Knight, who is now known as Lily
 Rose Lee, also revealed the relentless and horrific abuse she suffered for more than a 
decade at the hands of Ariel Castro but defiantly said: 'You can't break 
someone that's already been been broken. You can only make them 
stronger.'

With the one-year 
anniversary of her miraculous escape taking place on Tuesday, Miss Knight said that she wanted people to know that her life is 'awesome'.

She said that she loved nothing more than waking up in the morning, making a cup of coffee, watching TV and looking at the sky.

She also said that she was enjoying boxing training and singing, even recording her first song.

Amazingly, Miss Knight is available to forgive Castro. She said today that when she heard the news of his suicide in prison last year, she was saddened and 'confused why he wanted to hurt his children like that'.

She added: 'He was a human being... and everyone needs to be loved.'

Last year, when she realized that she was finally free, Miss Knight said she turned to fellow captive Gina DeJesus to tell her: 'You won't believe 
this. We are going home'.

Speaking
 to Today and NBC's Dateline, Miss Knight, 33, said that now, nearly 12 
months later, she sees herself as a butterfly, with the 'freedom to 
fly'.

Displaying all the strength and bravery that sustained her through more than a decade of torture and rape at the hands of Ariel Castro, Miss Knight said that she would comfort Gina DeJesus, telling her: 'One day we'll get out. One day we'll be free. One day we won't be voiceless.'

During the amazing interview, which aired in part on Sunday night, Miss Knight said that it was thinking of her son Joey which kept her alive until her dramatic escape on May 6, 2013, along with Miss DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Miss Berry's six-year-old daughter from the Ohio home.

She detailed the explicit mental torture that Castro would put her through and how her friendship with DeJesus kept her strong.

In one harrowing revelation, Miss Knight told Dateline the fear that came over her each time Castro caused her to become pregnant after sexually assaulting her.

Telling interviewer Savannah Guthrie 
that she was pregnant four or five times, Miss Knight said that each 
time Castro realized this he would beat her until she miscarried.

Asked how she reacted to this, Miss Knight said: 'He wanted to break me.'

'You can't break someone that's already been broken. You can only make them stronger.'

In one particularly harrowing tale, Miss Knight said that she tried to escape once through a door Castro had left open.

However, she was just not fast enough.

She
 revealed that following this, Castro would play mind games with the 
girls and leave doors tantalizingly ajar, to tempt the girls to run, 
only to then shut them in their faces, taunting them.

She
 then explained the emotional moment that she realized she was free 
after Amanda Berry escaped through a door left unintentionally open by 
Castro and called the police.

'I hear this big loud noise, crash, boom,' said Miss Knight.

'Then, it was the police.'

In an earlier interview, released to coincide with the year anniversary of her release, Miss Knight told how Castro would keep her and the other women locked in an upstairs room when guests would come to visit - blocking them in with piles of furniture.

Using a model reconstruction of the Ohio home, the 33-year-old, who has changed her name to Lily Rose Lee, explained how Castro 'would take speakers, a couch, chairs and block anyone from getting up the stairs at all'.

Miss Knight, who spent more than a decade locked up, also revealed that she has moved into her own apartment and started cooking classes as she dreams of becoming a chef.

She told Today: 'Sometimes in life you have a dark past that makes you who you are but doesn't define who you are.'

The 33-year-old is now known as Lily Rose Lee, a
 name she picked after her favorite flower. She explained her decision, saying: 'I felt like every brand new start needs new beginnings.'

Miss Knight said: 'There were days like he'll come in and he'll just do bad things in front of me, and I'll take her hand and I'll tell her everything's gonna be OK. One day we'll get out. One day we'll be free. One day we won't be voiceless.'

The 33-year-old earlier revealed that she has cut ties with the women she was held captive with for so many dark years.

She told People that the three survivors have put distance between each other as they all come to terms with the ordeal they suffered.

Michelle Knight's memoir was released on the first-anniversary of her escape on May 6

Miss Knight said: 'I love them and they love me. Hopefully we'll all get back together again.'

The 33-year-old has written a memoir Finding Me which comes out on May 6, the one-year anniversary of the women's escape.

In her book, she tells of the abuse she suffered at the hands of Castro, who killed himself in prison in September just weeks into his life sentence.

Knight had made a brave and defiant 
appearance at Castro's sentencing in August in which she told him: 'I 
spent 11 years in hell, your hell is just beginning.'

Ms Knight also reveals in her book the
 close bond she developed with the other women, who were all snatched 
off the streets of Cleveland by Castro between 2002 and 2004.

Ms Knight, who is 4'11, said that her hellish ordeal has taught her to enjoy every moment of her life.

She told People: 'I don't take things for granted 
anymore not even the little things like looking out a 
window. I went through years of torture, and now I'm back. I'm free to 
fly.'

Knight was 
the only one of Ariel Castro's three victims to appear in person at his 
trial. Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry's victim impact statements were 
read by members of their family.

The
 33-year-old described how the days turned into weeks, weeks into 
eternity and said when she was 'dying' from the abuse she suffered, her 
friendship with Gina was the only thing that kept her going.

Michelle Knight spoke of Castro's hypocrisy as he attended church every week and then came home to torture them.

'I remember all the times you came home talking about what everyone else was doing wrong when you were doing the same thing,' she said.

'I cried every night. I was so alone. I worried what would happen to me and the other girls every day.'

Speaking of her 'teammate' Gina, she said: 'She never let me fall, I never let her fall. She nursed me back to health when I was dying from her abuse. My friendship with her is the only good thing to come out of this situation.

'I will overcome all this that happened. I will live on, you will die a little every day,' she said to him. 'I will forgive you, but I will never forget.'
