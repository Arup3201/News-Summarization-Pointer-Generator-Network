A woman's first date with a man she met on OkCupid turned to disaster after he allegedly stole her car.

The woman, who has not been named, went for dinner with Gerald Tietz, who charmed her into meeting him at a restaurant in New Jersey last month.

The two later went back to the woman's house - at which point Tietz is accusing of filching her car keys and driving off in her red Toyota, along with some of her jewelry.

Police caught Tietz Saturday night after sharing his dating profile and pictures of the 2007 Solara, which had custom plates that read JSRYGRL.

According to officers, Tietz lured the woman to Racks Restaurant and Sports Bar in Atco, New Jersey after posing online as a 53-year-old called Gennaro Aladena.

Detectives also believe he could have tried the same trick on other women, also employing the pseudonym Mike Rossman, or his apparent nickname, Gooch.

Tietz, who is 5'1", and a bald smoker in his 50s, was arrested Saturday in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and booked into the Camden County jail.

Police did not explain what happened at the house before the car theft, and would only say that 'at some point' during the encounter 'the male got a hold of the keys'.

Tietz said he was from Atlantic City while allegedly posing on the dating site, and officers think he has strong ties to Atlantic County and Philadelphia.
