This is the dramatic moment a 400lb tiger leaps at a father-of-two, pinning him to the ground as she begins to maul him.

But fearless Randy Miller, 45, is in fact merely playing with the big cat Eden, who he has reared from birth and trained to carry out the fake attack.

At first the tiger leaps 15 feet into the air before pile-driving Mr Miller into the ground as part of the double act.

Power: Eden the 400lb tiger prepares to pounce on her trainer Randy Miller

Attack: Mr Miller prepares for the impact after the tiger has launched herself into the air

Impact: The full strength of the tiger can be seen as Mr Miller begins to fall to the ground

The animal then appears to begin to maul Mr Miller - who eventually gets up and walks away unharmed.

Mr Miller said: 'If a stranger tried to do this, they would get seriously injured, mauled or even killed.'

Mr Miller rears his star animals from birth and uses his lifelong bond with them to achieve wild things on the big screen.

He bottle and hand-fed Eden from birth, and eventually taught her to jump on him for food rewards.

At his special training facility in Big Bear, California, he has trained amazing creatures for roles in Transformers 2, The Last Samurai and many other big-screen productions.

'I like using Eden for the staged attack because she comes at me so fast and hits hard, so it’s very convincing,' Mr Miller said.

Double act: The tiger trainer appears to be in trouble as the big cat pins him to the ground - but it is all just an act

Frightening: Once he has him on the ground, the tiger appears to begin to maul Mr Miller

Performance: Despite Mr Miller's pained expression, the staged attack is all part of an act

'It’s like being hit by a professional American football player every time.

'She’s dependable and knows what she’s doing, but you still need to be cautious and play your role.

'You can hit your head and get knocked out and that becomes dangerous because the animal can take advantage of you.

'It’s in a predator’s instincts to prey on the weak, and it can come at any time.

'One bite could kill you, and if you get bit in the neck, you’re dead.'

Strength: Mr Miller rears his animals from birth and prepares them for roles in blockbuster films

Trained: The animal trainer said while the tiger is 'dependable', Mr Miller was still required to be cautious and 'play his role'

Prepared: The expert handler said he always has to be wary because 'it's in a predator's instincts to prey on the weak, and it can come at any time'

But Mr Miller said it is love and affection that helps him command his animals with precision.

'Some trainers show their fear when abusing these guys,' he said. 'There’s no reason to abuse them.

'I can do this because these animals think I’m their father.'

The
expert handler’s act with predators is so convincing it landed him a 
top stunt award for his work on Russell Crowe blockbuster Gladiator.

Lifelong bond: Mr Miller bottle and hand-fed Eden from birth, and eventually taught her to jump on him for food rewards

Lethal: Despite their bond, Mr Miller says he is all too aware of the danger the tiger poses

Connection: Mr Miller said it is love and affection that helps him command his animals with precision

They superimposed Crowe’s face onto 
Randy for a famous scene when main character Maximus was attacked by one
of Miller’s tigers, Tara, 18, in a Colosseum battle.

But Randy’s 2001 prize - the first ever World Stunt Academy Award - didn’t come without any pain.

Veteran movie animal Tara bit through Randy’s fake armour on his arm, which was made of leather.

'It wasn’t a big deal and I didn’t take it personally,' explained Randy. 'She just liked the smell and got possessive of it.'

Trainers: Mr Miller, pictured with his assistants, trains the animals at his special facility in Big Bear, California

In her later years Tara is now looking forwards to the quiet life on Randy’s ranch, and Eden is stepping up to be the new feline star in Tinseltown.

'Tara has all that experience and we still use her for certain things that draw on her maturity, but we look at Eden as her fierce stunt double.

'She’s younger and hits harder. For the staged tiger attack, she’s the very best.'
