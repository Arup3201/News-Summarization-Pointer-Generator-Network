The federal government has announced it will recognize
same-sex marriages performed in Utah.

Attorney General Eric Holder announced Friday the more than 1,000
unions performed in the state prior to the Supreme Court putting them on hold
will be eligible for federal benefits such as joint tax returns and spousal
visas.

Families should not be asked to endure uncertainty regarding
their benefits while courts decide the issue of same-sex marriage in Utah, Mr
Holder said in a video on the Justice Department's website.

Big announcement: Attorney General Eric Holder said the federal government will extend full benefits to same-sex couples already married in Utah

The decision flies in the face of Utah authorities who
earlier this week refused to legally recognize the marriages.

Utah Gov. Gary Herbert even told state agencies this week
not authorize benefits for married gay and lesbian couples until the courts
make a decision.

Neither Mr Herbert nor Utah State Attorney General Sean
Reyes had immediate comment on Holder's announcement.

More than 1,000 gay and lesbian couples have taken home
marriage licenses from local clerks since Utah's same-sex marriage ban was
overturned Dec. 20 by a federal judge – a decision that came into direct
conflict with a ban voted into law nine years ago.

State officials have railed against gay marriage despite
changing public sentiment around gay marriage.

Almost 73 per cent of locals responding to a recent Fox 13 poll
supported allowing gay marriages to continue in the state and about 20 per cent
directly opposed the unions.

The rest either felt the government shouldn’t have a say in
such matters or simply didn’t care one way or another about the issue.

Perhaps even more telling, the Mormon Church has decided against a rumored court filing in support of halting gay marriages, according to a separate Fox 13 report.

The U.S. Supreme Court put a halt Monday to same-sex
marriages in the heavily Mormon state while the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals considers the long-term question of whether gay couples have a
right to marry in Utah.

State agencies aren't supposed to revoke anything already
issued, such as a marriage certificate or a driver's license with a new name,
but they are prohibited from approving any new marriages or benefits.

The validity of the marriages will ultimately be decided by
the appeals court, officials said.

Mr Holder's declaration marked the latest chapter in the
legal battle over same-sex marriage in Utah that has sent couples and state
officials on a helter-skelter wave of emotions over the last three weeks.

Federal government agencies have previously confirmed that
same-sex couples in other states are entitled to federal benefits, but this is
the first time the Attorney General has come out publicly and issued this kind
of guidance, said Douglas NeJaime, a professor of law at the University of
California, Irvine.

‘Symbolically, it's an important step that the federal;
government has taken,’ said Mr NeJaime.

He explained it is hardly surprising, especially since the
federal government has insisted for several years that same-sex marriages be
honored.

‘The fed government has been pushing up against the states
that do not recognize same-sex marriages already,’ Mr NeJaime said. ‘This is
another step in that direction.’

Mr Holder said in a video on the Justice Department's
website that the government will coordinate among agencies in the coming days
to make sure Utah couples get the federal benefits they are entitled to.

The attorney general said that ‘for purposes of federal law,
these marriages will be recognized as lawful and considered eligible for all
relevant federal benefits on the same terms as other same-sex marriages.’

Holder's declaration was greeted with applause among
same-sex couples in Utah.

‘It gives me hope moving forward in the appeals process,’
Moudi Sbeity said. ‘It shows that there really is a social and cultural shift
in viewpoints and mindsets toward marriage equality.’

Mr Sbeity and partner Derek Kitchen are among three couples
who brought the Utah lawsuit that led to the surprise Dec. 20 ruling by U.S.
District Judge Robert Shelby, who said the state's ban on same-sex marriage
violated gay and lesbian couples' constitutional rights.

Mr Sbeity explained that he hopes Mr Holder's declaration
will persuade Gov. Herbert to shift the state's position. ‘I'm sure he doesn't
want 1,300 lawsuits on his desk,’ Sbeity said.

Several hundred same-sex marriage supporters were planning a
rally at the Utah State Capitol on Friday afternoon. Organizers planned to
deliver a petition to the governor and state attorney general asking them to
let the federal judge's ruling stand and allow gay marriages to continue.

Tim Wagner of Salt Lake City, one of the organizers of the
rally said Holder's announcement was ‘pretty amazing’ and a great thing for the
newly married couples.

‘It sounds like our national attorney general actually sees
the law in the way it should be acknowledged,’ Mr Wagner said. ‘The law is on
the side of rights and the people who want to love the people they love.’

On Thursday, the Utah attorney general issued legal advice
to local clerks, advising them to finish paperwork for same-sex marriages
completed before the Supreme Court issued a temporary halt.

Mr Reyes' new advice was issued to clear up some confusion
and only applies to marriages that were solemnized, a spokesperson said.

‘As long as the marital ceremony happened prior to the stay,
then the marriage can receive documentation,’ the spokesperson added.

The attorney general's office said Thursday's guidance was
not a decision on whether the marriages are valid.
