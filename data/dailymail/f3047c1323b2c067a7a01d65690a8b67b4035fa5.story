They were intended to be ‘Tapes from Beyond the Grave’ – explosive interviews with former IRA terrorists revealing some of their most notorious crimes.

The interviews, recorded for a history project, were granted only under strict condition that they were not released until after the deaths of all concerned.

But after a fierce legal battle, the secret interviews were passed to the police in Northern Ireland – and the bombshell revelations contained on the tapes are thought to be a key factor behind the dramatic arrest and questioning of Gerry Adams at a police station in Antrim yesterday.

At least 
two high-profile IRA operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader to the 
murder of Jean McConville, the mother of ten who was brutally abducted, 
executed and secretly buried in December 1972.

The former IRA terrorists who claim they served alongside Adams say he ordered the killing.

Adams
 has repeated and categorically denied involvement in the death or the 
IRA policy of ‘The Disappeared’ – men and women in Northern Ireland 
suspected of being informers of the British who were taken from the 
streets, questioned, shot and buried.

But
 the tapes and subsequent interviews allege a very different story in a 
detailed series of claims which were yesterday being put to the 
65-year-old politician and architect of the Good Friday agreement.

Denial: Adams has repeatedly denied involvement in McConville's death or the IRA policy of 'The Disappeared'

Grieving: Jean McConville's family members carry flowers and a photo of their mother following her death

They
 include two damning accounts – one of which was given by ex-hunger 
striker Brendan ‘Darkie’ Hughes, a former deputy commander of the IRA’s 
Belfast Brigade.

Hughes,
 who died in 2008, said McConville was killed on Adams’ orders. ‘There 
was only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed . . . 
 that man is now the head of Sinn Fein,’ he said.

‘I
 did not give the order to execute that woman. He did. I knew she was 
being executed. I knew that. I didn’t know she was going to be buried or
 disappeared as they called them now.

‘The
 special squad was brought into the operation then called the Unknowns, 
you know, when anyone needed to be taken away, they normally done it. I 
had no control over this squad. Gerry had control over this particular 
squad.’

Search: Irish police excavate the beach in Louth, Ireland, where the body of Jean McConville was found in 2003

Removing her body: The mother of ten's body is removed from an area near Templetown beach in County Louth

Funeral: The family of McConville carry her coffin into church - 31 years after she was abducted and murdered

The
 other damning account is that of Dolours Price, the first woman to 
become a member of an IRA active service unit and the leader of the 
terror cell which bombed the Old Bailey in 1973.

Price,
 who died last year, recounted how she was chosen to be part of a small 
select unit within the three battalions that made up the Belfast 
Brigade.

The group of eight hand-picked volunteers, labelled ‘the 
Unknowns’, were responsible for ‘special operations, including internal 
investigations to weed out informers’.

‘The
 hardest thing I ever did was drive those people away, the Disappeared,’
 Price said. ‘I never knew for sure their ultimate end, I was simply 
told by Gerry Adams to take the people away, a couple of lads or 
whatever.

Interview: Gerry Adams remained in police custody here in Co Antrim, where he has been in custody since Wednesday

'It was part of my job within the “Unknowns” to take them 
across the border to hand them over to others. I don’t even remember 
some of the names, isn’t that terrible?’

Price’s interview continued: ‘I drove away Jean McConville, a very, very unpleasant woman.

‘I know I shouldn’t speak ill of the dead and I don’t think she deserved to die and, at the time, I didn’t know she had children.

Damning: Dolours Price, the first woman to become a member of an IRA active service unit, was the other operative to give a damning account

‘I had a call one night and Adams was in a house down the Falls Road and she’d (McConville) been arrested by Cumann na mBan (a female wing of the IRA) women and held for a couple of days. She got into my car and as far as she was concerned she was being taken away by the Legion of Mary to a place of safety.

‘It was unfortunate for her and it was unfortunate for me as well because she was a foul-mouthed woman who cursed and swore a lot all the way down to the border. She went on and on about “them provies, they wouldn’t have the balls to shoot me... I don’t care what I did”. I was saying to myself, “please don’t say any more”, but she went on and on – she convicted herself out of her own mouth. It wasn’t my decision to disappear her, thank God.

‘You don’t deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person, as she was, but you do deserve to die if you are an informer, I do believe that. Particularly in a war, that is the Republican way.’ 

Like Hughes, Price provided her personal account of her time in the IRA to be part of the Boston College history project and in subsequent interviews.

Researchers at Boston College last year lost a Supreme Court challenge in the US when they tried to block the release of the 84 tapes after the PSNI launched a high-profile legal challenge. So far, 11 have been handed over relating to the McConville case.

The wild card in any prosecutions could be a former IRA man called Ivor Bell, 77, who had a bitter split with Adams in the mid-1980s.

Bell’s interviews, if accepted as admissible evidence, could be used against Adams because Bell is still alive. Bell was charged in March with aiding and abetting in the murder of McConville, which he denies.
