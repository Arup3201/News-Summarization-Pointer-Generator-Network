The Care Quality Commission has identified 1,200 GP practices in England which may not be providing safe care (file picture, posed by model)

One in six GP surgeries could be putting tens of thousands of patients at risk, according to the NHS watchdog.

The Care Quality Commission has identified 1,200 practices in England which may not be providing safe care, including 864 it has categorised as of ‘highest concern’.

Failings include misdiagnosing cancer, inadequate care of the elderly and making patients wait too long for appointments.

CQC chief inspector Professor Steve Field said most surgeries were managing to provide good care despite high demand, but added: ‘We’re sadly finding some very poor practices.

‘These typically are chaotic, have very poor leadership and a lack of learning culture. They also have a poor skill mix – some don’t have any nurses. 

'Patients could be at risk by simple things such as by prescribing out-of-date medicines and vaccines. ’

The poorly performing surgeries will be prioritised for vigorous, day-long spot checks over the next two years, which could lead to the worst being closed down.

Preliminary assessments of nearly all 8,000 surgeries in England were carried out as part of a new Ofsted-style ratings system based on 38 categories covering safety and basic care. 

The surgeries have been placed into one of six categories ranging from ‘highest concern’ to ‘lowest concern’. 

Patients can go to the CQC website to see how their surgery is performing in comparison with neighbouring practices and how they rate according to national standards.

Criteria include detection rates for cancer and dementia, opening hours, giving patients the flu jab and the numbers of frail, elderly patients ending up in A&E because they are not properly looked after. The consequences for patients of any one of these failings can be catastrophic.

Several practices have been identified as having high rates of patients whose cancers are only detected in A&E – because the GP failed to diagnose it in previous appointments. By this stage, the cancer has often spread to other organs and may have become untreatable.

The CQC also identified 217 surgeries which could be putting young women at risk by not offering them screening for cervical cancer. A further 228 are making patients wait far too long to see a doctor or nurse.

The surgeries were given a score for each of the 38 indicators. These were added together to give an overall score, with the final result determining which of the six bands they were placed in. 

There were 864 surgeries in band 1 (‘highest concern’) and 332 in band 2. By comparison there were 3,979 surgeries in band 6 (‘lowest concern’).

Prof Field, who is also a GP in Edgbaston, Birmingham, added: ‘GPs are under a lot of pressure but they are demonstrating that even in deprived areas they can provide fantastic care. I do have concerns about access to practices. But we need to do more to encourage people to take better care of themselves and to make better use of pharmacies.’

Prof Field said he expected that only about 160 practices (two per cent) would be put in special measures, where officials from NHS England would step in and instruct them to make urgent improvements. If these are not carried out, the surgeries could be closed down and patients taken on by others nearby.

Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: ‘The patients at these high-risk practices should be told so they have the option of going elsewhere.

‘That is part of the NHS’s duty of candour, its obligation to be honest and open. Over the past 18 months there has been a rise in the number of patients contacting us with concerns – most notably not being able to get an appointment, which is fundamental.’

GPs are being warned not to close early over the festive period.

NHS officials have written to surgeries over concerns they will close their doors mid-afternoon on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve when it is traditionally quiet.

Last year NHS England found that one in 20 GPs had shut by 4pm and left patients in the hands of out-of-hours firms.

A letter sent to practices last week – obtained by Pulse magazine – reminds them that Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve are ‘normal working days’.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘The NHS must be open and transparent and patients should be provided with as much information as possible about their GP practice.

‘We know that if patients are provided with information, they are able to make more meaningful choices about their healthcare. The more transparent and honest a GP surgery and its staff are, the more confidence the public will have in the system.’

Patients can check their surgery’s rating by going to www.cqc.org.uk/content/our-intelligent-monitoring-gp-practices and inserting their postcode. However, the website has already been criticised by some patients as being riddled with jargon and difficult to interpret.

Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, said: ‘There are just too many patients and not enough doctors. Many are just stretched to the limit and that is why so many patients are ending up in A&E.’

Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, added: ‘Many practices are struggling to meet quality standards due to factors beyond their control, such as lack of funding, significant increases in patient consultations and difficulties in trying to recruit sufficient GPs to meet patients’ needs.’

Mike Bewick, deputy medical director at NHS England, said: ‘We’re pleased this report shows that despite the increased pressure on GPs there are so many good and outstanding practices across the country.’
