While the superstars of Arsenal and Manchester City played out a thrilling 2-2 draw on the Emirates pitch on Saturday, there were a host of big names in attendance off it too.

Lewis Hamilton and Samuel L Jackson, as well as Wretch 32 and Professor Green, made the trip to north London.

The quartet were all at the Emirates to pledge their support to the anti-homophobia campaign, Rainbow Laces, appearing in a short video posted on Arsenal's YouTube.
