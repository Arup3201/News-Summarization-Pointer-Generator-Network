It used to be a landmark age when women crossed over from being youthful and desirable to being over-the-hill. 

But today turning 40, is no longer a harbinger of middle age but for many it's just another phase of our ever extending youth with all the anxieties of opportunities not taken and plans left undone.

Here three generations of women discuss how they felt about the big 4-0, and how society's view of women as they age has changed for the better over their lifetimes.

The 39-year-old says talking to her mother and grandmother about turning 40 has helped her feel less downhearted about ageing, going grey and being more critical of her appearance

THE GRANDMOTHER 

Mollie Guillaume, 87, is retired and lives in Chigwell, Essex with her sister, Joan, 84. She says:

'Back then, once a woman turned 40 she was expected to dress in a more subdued way, get a shorter haircut and generally become quite staid in appearance.

'Nowadays of course it seems like anything goes on the wardrobe front until you die - I see some old biddies these days who look ridiculous, showing off their scrawny legs in clothes meant for teenagers and coated in thick, gaudy make-up.

'I've always liked wearing tailored, comfortable clothes in flattering colours so my appearance hasn't changed too much from birthday to birthday. 

'I don't like the idea of getting older; I don't feel 87. But I've always eaten carefully, kept active, travelled the world and spent quality time with my family and friends - and I have my health after getting cancer in my 50s - so instead of moaning about it I just feel very, very lucky I'm still here.

'My daughter Helen looks in the mirror and can't believe there's an old woman staring back at her, but I'm used to it so it's not a shock for me any more.

'As my granddaughter hits 40, she should really be thinking "I'm halfway done now, if I'm lucky, so let's enjoy this life!"

THE MOTHER 

Helen Ivens, 65, is retired and lives in Chigwell, Essex, with her husband Keith, 66.

'I didn't want a big party for my 40th birthday, so my husband took me for a romantic weekend in a Paris, without the children, who were 14, eight and two at the time.

'But I wasn't depressed. In fact I remember feeling happier than I ever had in my life. Turning 40 coincided with a great sense of relief that my life was stable and on an even keel after a difficult first half.

'In fact 40 was a great turning point for me, and it's been good ever since.

'The catchphrase at the time - on cards, badges and banners - was Forty and Over the Hill, so I was quite surprised, as the big day loomed, how not elderly I felt. 

'When I was a teen, when someone turned 40 I considered them very much past it and on the verge of old age. But physically I looked and felt okay.

'I had a big Charlie's Angels perm and a penchant for shoulder pads and fuschia, but that was the style of the time. My daughter thinks I look better now.

'In the 1980s, when I turned 40, I was definitely the oldest mum at the school gates. The other fortysomethings waiting there were grandmas.

Helen Ivens, now 65, with her daughter Sarah, who is about to turn 40, on holiday in the Cotswolds last year. Helen says that when she turned 40 in the 1980s, it felt like a new phase of her life was beginning, 'If you have good health and enough money to be comfortable, it can be a great phase of your life'

'But of course this is all different now, and my daughter Sarah is not unusual that she is turning 40 with a one-year-old daughter.

'Having a daughter who is turning 40 is quite a milestone for me. In fact, it's a bigger shock to the system than when I turned 40.

'In my head I still feel about 38, so to have a child of 40 is a startling reality check. But I'm excited for her to reach this landmark age.

'If you have good health and enough money to be comfortable, it can be a great phase of your life. In fact, in a way, life begins at 40.

THE DAUGHTER 

Sarah Ivens, 39, lives in London with her husband Russell and children William, three, and Matilda, one.

'My dad recently told me that 60 is the new 40, so 40 must be the new 20. I think he was trying to cheer me up but I just thought "Oh please no, I haven't got the energy to live my 20s again!"

'But I think that has more to do with having two young children than the amount of candles I'm about to blow out on my birthday cake.

'It's been very reassuring to talk to my mother and grandmother about turning 40 though because I have been surprised at how downhearted it's made me feel. 

'I feel a real sense of loss, about things gone by, opportunities not taken. I feel like I get to turn a giant egg timer over once more and then that's it. I'm half way done.

'But as my sensible grandma said to me "darling, the alternative to turning 40 is much worse so just get on with it."

Mollie (second from right), with her daughter Helen (far left), sister Joan and granddaughter Sarah (far right) says when she turned 40 in 1968 women were expected to dress conservatively and become quite staid in appearance with a shorter haircut, despite the women's liberation movement sweeping across Britain

'I've never paid much attention to my appearance but suddenly I'm studying everything in cruel, minute detail.

'In the last year I've gone quite grey and I've started to notice wrinkles and lines that I don't think were there before. They may have been of course, but I just wasn't looking for them. And I just don't feel as bouncy. 

'My body definitely takes longer to recover after exercise, and that extra slice of pizza will now puff out the tummy that once stayed resolutely flat.

'Most of my friends have already turned 40 and I've noticed the trend to throw parties as big as weddings in a giant celebration of yourself.

'I love going to these things because you really see how far people have come. I normally get quite overwhelmed with emotion.

'My mum said she thinks me and all my friends, many of whom she's known for over 20 years, look better now than we ever have. I don't think she's just saying that.

'I think along with added wrinkles, we've added confidence - and certainly we're making better make-up and hairstyle choices.'
