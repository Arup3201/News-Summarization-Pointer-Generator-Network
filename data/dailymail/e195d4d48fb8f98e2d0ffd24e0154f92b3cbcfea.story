No grudges: Ashraf Rossli, who was attacked during the London riots, says he still loves Britain

The Malaysian student mugged by yobs who posed as Good Samaritans said yesterday that he still loves Britain.

Ashraf Rossli, 20, was rushed to hospital with a broken jaw after being beaten up and robbed during the riots less than a month after arriving in the country.

A 20-year-old was arrested yesterday on suspicion of robbery in connection with the attack and remains in custody. Prime Minister David Cameron said the attack left him 'disgusted'.

A video of the incident showed hooded
youths pretending to help him before going through his rucksack, 
stealing his mobile phone and wallet in Barking, East London on Monday 
night.

Mr Rossli, who was discharged from hospital yesterday, said he harboured no grudges.

He said: 'Britain is great. Before I came here I was very eager and I haven't got any ill-feelings about what happened.

'My family are worried about me and 
my mother would like me to go home. But I am determined to stay. I feel 
very sorry for the people who did this.

'It was really sad because among them
were children.' He had been helped by two girls and a woman who lived 
nearby following the incident, he added.

Riot victim: Accountancy student Ashraf Rossli, 20, had only arrived in Britain a month ago. Here he is pictured

brother Mohammed Fatiri

This week, at the family's home in 
the affluent suburb of Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, his mother Maznah Abu 
Mansor, 47, said she was horrified by the attack.

The mother-of-three, a school 
official, said she was 'very sad and upset' and appealed to the 
Malaysian government to help her to travel to London to see her son.

She said: 'I was initially very worried but I'm glad that he is all right.'

Mr Rossli arrived in London last 
month to study at Kaplan College in Tower Hill, East London. He was 
cycling from his student accommodation in Barking with a friend when the
attack happened.

The accountancy student thanked those who contributed to a fund to support him, saying: 'It is very nice of you all to help me.'

Mr Rossli described how he was attacked, 
reliving his ordeal from his hospital bed when he was visited by a 
friend who filmed the chat and posted it online.

'They threatened to stab me, they 
told me they had knives,' he says in the footage, available on YouTube 
and translated by Channel 4 News.

'Some of them were quite young, maybe still in primary school. They had their hoods on and demanded my bicycle.'

Getting better: Mr Rossli was being treated at Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, following the attack

A statement from Barts and The London
NHS Trust today said: 'Ashraf Rossli, the Malaysian student being 
treated for injuries sustained during the recent civil disorder in 
London, has now been discharged from the Royal London hospital to 
continue his recuperation at home.'

The statement continued: 'Ashraf is 
grateful for the many messages of goodwill and offers of support he has 
received from members of the public the length and breadth of the 
country.'

Prime Minister David Cameron said the attack left him 'disgusted'.

He said: 'When we see the disgusting 
sight of a young man with people pretending to help him while they are 
robbing him, it is clear that there are things badly wrong with our 
society.'

Mr Rossli said that he appreciated 
David Cameron's support for him but said he did not want to comment 
about the Prime Minister's description of a 'sick society'.
