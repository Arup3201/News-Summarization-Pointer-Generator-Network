Staff at a bar where a woman announced her plans to divorce her cheating husband on a public sign are urging the man to come forward to tell his side of the story.

Noah's Yard in Swansea, south Wales, were happy to oblige when a scorned woman asked them to name and shame her spouse who, she discovered, was having an affair with his yoga teacher.

Now, nosy local residents are trying to entice the man into having his say, with a new sign reading: 'Coming soon: Paul's story'.

Staff at Noah's Yard in Swansea are urging Paul to come forward with his side of the story after his wife publicly announced her plans to divorce him

Last week the bar put up a message from the man's heartbroken wife that read: 'Paul I am divorcing you.'

A later one informed him: 'BTW I am keeping the dog.'

The
woman, who wants to remain anonymous, was 'devastated' to learn 
her husband was having an affair, and vengefully decided to publicly 
humiliate him.

Though a friend claims the man is 'furious' with his wife's actions, he is reluctant to come forward amid all the local gossip.

But Noah's Yard staff are hoping to entice him out of the woodwork as 'everyone wants to know what he looks like.'

'It's his own fault, you could argue, he did apparently cheat on his wife,' said bar owner Noah Redfern.

'But we want him to come in, we're intrigued.

'Obviously this puts a bit of pressure on him,' he added.

The man's wife has been left 'terribly upset' by the ordeal which has seen an end to their marriage. 

Shock: An angry wife persuaded staff at nightspot Noah's Yard in Swansea's Uplands district to put up the sign reading 'Paul... I am divorcing you' above the door

Anger: The sign expressing her wife for a divorce was followed up with a statement revealing she was keeping the couple's dog

'I was angry and upset so wanted a sign to go up for everyone to see,' she told the  South Wales Evening Post.

'When I found out I went through a mixture of emotions but felt angry and wanted him to pay.

'I had a drink in the bar on Tuesday and decided to get my own back.

'We have been married for years and it is so sad it has come to this.

'I am absolutely devastated and going through a really tough time at the moment.

'A lot of my friends and family have seen it and have been supporting me.

'I did feel a bit better once the sign went up. I wanted to name and shame him.'

Linda
Davies, who lives close to the bar, said: 'Good on her. If my husband 
ever cheated on me then I would string him up by his privates.

Kimmie Powell, 24, and Noah Redfern, 35, of Noah's Yard are urging Paul to come forward to tell his side of the story

'Maybe he thought he could get away with sleeping around but I bet he is regretting it now.'

Passerby Ron Williams said it would keep a lot of men in the area on their toes.

He said: 'I would be mortified if that ever happened to me.

'This could give a lot of wives in the city an idea - I'm guessing there will be a few nervous husbands walking down the street today.'

Noah’s Yard changes the words on its sign on a regular basis, often displaying statements such as 'Go Wales' for rugby matches.

The bar once had a romantic proposal emblazoned above the entrance, coincidentally reading 'Marry Me Paul', though it is not thought the two men are the same.
