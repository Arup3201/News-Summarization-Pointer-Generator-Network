A few short years ago, Pippa Middleton's bottom was the toast of the nation.

How fickle the public is. The Duchess of Cambridge's sister, who caused a worldwide sensation in her clinging Alexander Queen dress on Royal Wedding Day, has now slipped into third place in a 'best bum' survey.

She was been pipped at the post by curvy Kelly Brook and runner-up Holly Willoughby.

Kelly Brook came top in a poll of best bottoms - no need to artificially enlarge (as she did, right, in an homage to Kim Kardashian's infamous belfie), people think she's perfect the way she is

She works at it: Kelly Brook's personal trainer Ashley Borden tweeted this pic of her new client in the gym doing dead weights

Famous derriere: Pippa wrote in her book Celebrate that it was strange to suddenly become recognised thanks to her bottom

What a mess: Willoughby ended up with floury handprints on her Diane Von Furstenberg dress thanks to cheeky co-host Phillip Schofield on This Morning

It appears shapely bottoms - like those of Holly Willoughby and Kelly Brook - are the most envied celebrity backsides, with petite behinds (we mean you, Abbey Clancy and Lucy Mecklenburgh) proving less popular.

And the good news is that just over half of British women are embracing their curves, with an 54 per cent of happy with their bottom size and shape. 

The survey of 2,000 women, commissioned by The Original Factory Shop to launch a new knickers range, revealed that 42 per cent of women still think that men prefer small, pert behinds like Abbey Clancey’s and Lucy Mecklenburgh’s.

The survey also revealed that the most popular type of underwear is the mini brief (30 per cent) followed by the classic Bridget Jones full brief (24 per cent), beating ‘sexy’ alternatives such as French knickers (20 per cent) and thongs (11 per cent).
