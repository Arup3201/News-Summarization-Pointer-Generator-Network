A father-of-two who lost his entire memory after a breakdown has spoken of his struggle - and re-proposed to his loyal wife live on TV.

Two years ago, Damian Hammond left for work as usual but never made it - instead ending up in A&E after completely losing his
 memory due to a combination of stress and trauma.

When his wife Cathy eventually located him in a local hospital, she was told he had total memory loss.

Devoted: Damian Hill lost his entire memory two years ago. He didn't even know his own name, recognise himself or wife Cathy after the incident

New memories: Today Damian re-proposed to his wife live on national TV as a thank you for her love and support

When she later walked into the hospital room, he had no idea who she was - instead thinking she was a doctor.

Over the past two years, she has remained by his side, trying to teach him not only about his past, but also how to perform basic activities such as brushing his teeth and getting dressed.

Mr Hammond, 35, told ITV's This Morning: 'I was driving to work one night in May 2012 when I was struck with a severe bout of stress.

'Hours later, I woke up in hospital. Then a woman walked into the hospital bay and said "Damian".

'I thought she was a doctor and looked at her blankly.

He told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: 'I love her with all my heart', and then turned to Cathy and said: 'Will you re-marry me?, to which she replied 'yes, I will.'

True love: Damian said even when he didn't recognise Cathy, he thought she looked nice

'She said "Damian - that is your name. I'm Cathy and I'm your wife".

'I didn't know what a wife was.

'She lifted up her wedding ring finger and clicked her ring into mine. We have jigsaw wedding rings and that made me realise we must be linked in some way.'

'I saw her and thought "she looks nice and friendly". I was quite excited, but confused.

Cathy then explained the couple have two children - and fortunately, Damian had their names tattooed on his arm.

Recalling the fateful night, Cathy told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: 'His work called to say he hadn't turned up and so I called the Police.

'I saw her and thought "she looks nice and friendly". I was quite excited, but confused.,' he recalled

'Later that evening I got a call from the local hospital saying there was a chap there called Damain Hammond.

'My first question was "is he alive or dead"?

'They said he was fit and well, but couldn't remember anything.'

She admitted that she had no idea how extreme his memory loss would be.

'I had to fib to the children a bit, as you do. I told them that Daddy had slipped on mud, hit his head and had lost a bit of memory.'

Damian's memory loss was so bad that he didn't even recognise himself in the mirror. 'I was scared, as I am a big chap,' he said

She then began the painstaking - and often heartbreaking - process of teaching her husband who he was, his past, and how to live.

Damian's memory loss was so bad that he didn't even recognise himself in the mirror.

'I was scared, as I am a big chap [and wondered who it was],' he explained to Ruth and Eamonn.

Cathy said his personalty was also much more formal. 'He was very innocent and wide-eyed and would call me Catherine, rather than a nickname,' she recalls.

Two years on, he is still unable to remember huge swathes of his past.

Damian says there have been flickers of his childhood that have returned - and he has had dozens of old friends contact him on social media to help try and plug the gap.

But there have been other times when his memory loss has devastated him.

He told the programme: 'There were some pictures of me holding the children after they were born and I couldn't remember any of it. I just sat there and burst out crying.'

But Cathy says she now focuses on creating new memories, rather than trying to re-invoke old ones with bags of old photos.

And this morning, he paved the way to making more new memories by asking his wife to 're-marry' him.

He told Ruth and Eamonn: 'I love her with all my heart', and then turned to Cathy and said: 'Will you re-marry me?, to which she replied 'yes, I will.'
