Warning: Dame Julie, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, claimed some elderly patients are starving on wards and are being treated without dignity

Tens of thousands of elderly patients are enduring appalling NHS care because they are too frightened – or too polite – to complain.

They suffer in silence fearing even worse treatment if they dare to raise criticism, England’s health watchdog Dame Julie Mellor warned.

She said she had investigated cases of pensioners being effectively starved on wards and treated without a shred of dignity.

But these, she believes, are just the tip of the iceberg because many over-65s are reluctant to complain.

She said: ‘Often older people fear negative repercussions when they make a complaint, or they simply don’t like to “make a fuss”.’

Dame Julie, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, said this fear prevents the health service learning from mistakes.

While pensioners receive around half of all NHS care, just a third of complaints to her office come from the elderly – indicating their voices are not being heard.

The damning comments from such a high-profile figure are significant because they indicate that, despite all the reforms announced after the Mid Staffordshire scandal, little has changed.

The Daily Mail has highlighted the failure of the health service to listen effectively  to patients as part of its Dignity for the Elderly campaign.

Now the ombudsman has demanded a ‘significant cultural shift’ in the way complaints are handled. She believes a single body should handle all complaints about health, social care and other services.

She said: ‘Only with a significant changein attitudes towards complaints and a drive to reforming the complaints system will the NHS make the improvements it needs.’

Under the present system, people must complain to the offending trust first, and only if they are dissatisfied can they contact the ombudsman.

Despite being the last port of call for complaints, Dame Julie receives around 16,000 every year.

Of 904 NHS cases she investigated between April and December last year, 222 concerned the elderly.

She said: ‘There are common themes running through complaints about the care of older people. 

Misdiagnosis, staff attitudes, poor communication with patients and families, substandard nutrition, and patients not being treated with  dignity, just to name a few.’

One older man with Alzheimer’s and diabetes was prevented from going home to die beside the brother he had lived with his whole life. This, she said, was the result of a ‘string of errors by five organisations across health and social care’.

‘They left it a month before they had a meeting about his care, by which time he’d passed away without his dying wish being honoured.’

In another case, a hospital did not consult the family on a decision not to resuscitate and in a third, staff switched off a patient’s life support against a family’s express wishes.  Research by Dame Julie’s organisation found that a quarter of older people don’t know how to complain.

‘Complaints are a gift to the NHS because that is how improvements are achieved,’ she said.

Reform: She believes a single body should handle all complaints about the NHS, social care and other services

‘Older people should be encouraged to complain and should be taken seriously when they do. But my fear is that too many older people are suffering in silence.’

We may be ‘seeing the tip of the iceberg’, she said, calling for a new  single Public Ombudsman Service.

‘People need and deserve a joined-up complaints system so they only need to raise their complaint once and so it can be dealt with by the same person,’ she said.

Caroline Abrahams, director of the charity Age UK, said: ‘It is not acceptable for any patient not to receive adequate nutrition or hydration, not to have their personal hygiene attended to, and not to be treated with basic dignity and respect.

‘Preventing abuse and neglectful care must be a priority for the NHS . . . We see some moves to improve complaints processes and listen to feedback from older people, but we need to go much further and faster.’

By JULIE MELLOR, HEALTH SERVICE OMBUDSMAN

Older people are some of the most frequent users of the NHS but they are less likely to complain about treatment and care when standards slip to unacceptable levels.

Our research shows that a quarter of older people don’t know where to go to complain about the NHS, despite using the service more often than people under 65.

Complaints are a gift to the NHS because that is how improvements are achieved. Older people should be encouraged to complain and taken seriously when they do.

Problems: Many elderly patients do not complain about conditions because they do not want to make a fuss (file picture)

But my fear is that too many older people are suffering in silence. Almost 80 per cent of all the investigations we carry out are about NHS services. Even though nearly half of NHS care and services are given to older people, only a third of the health complaints we investigate are about the care of older people.

The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman is the final step for people who have been treated unfairly or received a poor service from the NHS in England, or a government department or agency.

Our role is to investigate complaints without taking sides and make recommendations to put things right.

But older people’s reluctance to complain, coupled with their not knowing where to go to make a complaint, could mean we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg of serious failings in the care of people who are 65 and over.

Of the cases we do see, there are common themes running through complaints about the care of older people.

Misdiagnosis, staff attitudes, poor communication with patients and families, substandard nutrition, and patients not being treated with dignity, just to name a few.

We believe there still needs to be a significant cultural shift in the way complaints are handled across the health and social care  system. More needs to be done to tackle the toxic cocktail of reluctance by patients, carers and families to complain, and a defensive response from the NHS when they do.

Making a complaint should be easy and transparent. Often older people fear negative repercussions when they make a complaint, or they simply don’t like to ‘make a fuss’. But complaining can make a difference and often people tell us they made a complaint because they don’t want the same thing happening to somebody else.

If people aren’t satisfied with the way the complaint has been handled by the NHS, then they can make a complaint to us, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.

We know older people often rely on both NHS and social services and our joint investigations of treatment and care failings, with the Local Government Ombudsman, have highlighted the heartbreaking consequences when older people fall through the gaps between health and social care services.

People deserve a joined-up complaints system so they only need to raise their complaint once and so it can be dealt with by the same  person throughout.

And that’s why we want a single Public Ombudsman Service for England and the United Kingdom, which puts people at the centre of the complaints process, to be responsible for all complaints concerning public services, including health and social care.

Only with a significant change in attitudes towards complaints and a drive to reform will the NHS make the improvements it needs to ensure all older people are treated with dignity and respect.

Almost half of Parkinson’s sufferers are denied vital medication while in hospital, say campaigners. They say that many leave in a worse state than when they were admitted. Sufferers may need ten tablets a day at set times, but while in hospital they must rely on staff to provide pills. Research shows 47 per cent of people with the neurological condition were denied regular access to their medication while in hospital.
