'The preliminary investigation has determined 
that a verbal altercation occurred between an employee and a customer,' Fulton
 County police Cpl. Kay Lester told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. 'At some point, the male employee retrieved a weapon and 
fired upon the customer. That male customer was deceased at the scene.'

The victim has been identified as Adrian Mosley, 33.

Witness Ontray Haley said he was eating when two men and a woman arrived at the diner.

'The girl got into it first with the security guard and they told her she had to leave the property,' he said. 'So she left but the other two guys hung around 
and they told them they had to leave. The cook refused to serve them 
because they were getting unruly.'

The men then 'got into it with the cook and the guy that got shot, he threatened 
the cook. He told him, you come outside and I’m going to fire you up, 
which basically meant he wanted to shoot him.'

Witnesses said as many as four shots were fired after an argument broke out with an unruly couple

It was then the shooting started.

'“It
 occurred right at the counter,' Haley said. 'It was just chaos; I was 
ducking for cover like everybody else. I looked up and I saw the guy in 
the floor, dead.'

While he believed he heard three or four shots he could not be certain. 

'I was too busy ducking,' he said.
