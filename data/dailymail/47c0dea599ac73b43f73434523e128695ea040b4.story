For every traveller on a shoe-string budget, every dollar counts.

While it may seem as though Europe is one of the most expensive places in the world to holiday, it turns out that almost every single country has bargain buys.

Hostelworld.com has compiled an infographic outlining what tourists can buy in each country for $1.

In the UK, one dollar will get you just a pickled egg, whereas in Hungary for the same amount, travellers could buy you a glass of wine.

Sweet tooth? Head to Croatia for a scoop of ice cream or Turkey for a piece of baklava.

Best of all, it turns out that public transport in Eastern Europe is a steal, with a train ride from the airport to Lithuania's city centre coming in at just a dollar.

The only place where you can get absolutely no bang for your buck? Norway.
