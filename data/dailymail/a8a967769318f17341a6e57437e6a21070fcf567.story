Kate Middleton was today voted most stylish British celebrity following her recent royal tour of Australia and New Zealand.

And she should thank the Queen, who reportedly counselled Kate on her look for the three-week trip, advising her to embrace longer hemlines and a more sophisticated style.

The Duchess, who garnered 21 per cent of the total vote, beat supermodel and fashionista Kate Moss, who scored a measly 4 per cent and A-Lister Emma Watson on 5 per cent.

The Queen reportedly instructed the naturally stylish Kate to embrace lower hemlines and a more regal look for the tour of Australia and New Zealand

Kate seems to have inspired British women, with many now feeling that knee-length skirts are a better and more sophisticated option

And it looks like the Queen’s style 
influence is extending beyond royal circles, with a third of women (33 
per cent) admitting they’re now more inclined to invest in longer-length
 skirts.

The majority (9 in 10 women) now agree this look is far classier and would actually make them feel more confident (65 per cent).

Interestingly the younger generation is keenest on Kate's sophisticated look, with 18-24 year olds (18 per cent) most eager to replicate Kate’s wardrobe.

Furthermore, almost three-quarters of men (72 per cent) deem a knee-length skirt a classier look, preferring their partners to wear longer skirts.

However, two-thirds (64 per cent) of males admit short skirts are more likely to grab their attention.

The Duchess has even manage to beat fashion icon Kate Moss following her string of hit outfits on tour

Over half (57 per cent) of men also admitted to judging whether or not a woman is ‘wife material’ by the clothes she wears.

And Kate Middleton isn’t the only one to bow to the pressure of grandparents and in-laws. Over half of women (51 per cent) say they dress more conservatively when visiting relatives so as not to give a bad impression (48 per cent) and be seen as classy (67 per cent).

Commenting on the findings, Nick Chalkley, Head Fashion Buyer at QVC, who commissioned the study, said: 'When it comes to style it’s clear to see the Queen’s opinion reigns supreme.

'Under Her Majesty’s careful guidance, Kate has managed to top the style stakes with more women preferring a longer-length style.'
