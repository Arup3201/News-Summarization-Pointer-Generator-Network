As a goldfish, the last you need is a problem swimming.

But fortunately for Ada, her caring owner came to the rescue with an ingenious solution after a disability left her stranded at the bottom of he tank.

The beloved pet was given a tiny life-belt contraption that now allows Ada to happily swim around like all her friends.

Footage of her new-found freedom has been making waves online after her American owner, known only as 'synirr', posted them on YouTube.

In a message under the video, synirr says: 'My disabled goldfish scooting around in her newly redesigned sling. She has trouble maintaining buoyancy on her own.

'She looks a little silly, but it is better than lying at the bottom of the tank all day!'

And footage in which Ada happily takes food from her owner's hand is captioned: 'Have to make sure she's getting enough to eat. She is very tame :)'

Buoyancy problems are fairly common among goldfish and can cause them to either float on the surface or sink to the bottom of the tank.

The cause of this imbalance is due to complications with their swim bladder, a two-chambered air sack located in their body cavity that enables them to keep balance while they are not moving.

Disabled: Ada's owner says she has trouble maintaining her own buoyancy, which could have been caused by a problem with her swim bladder

Problems can occur for any number of 
reasons including sudden changes in temperature, pressure from food or 
air in the stomach, and infections.

The condition can often be treated by changing the goldfish's diet as the problem usually arises from its eating habits.

Owners are advised not to overfeed their fish and to try alternative floating or slow-sinking granular foods.

It is also suggested changing the water or adding tonic salt to help reduce stress on the fish.

If none of these measures work, it may be that the fish has permanent damage.

But they can often live to a good age regardless, particularity if you have the added help your very own buoyancy aid.
