Sir Bradley Wiggins remained in sixth position overall after Thursday's fifth stage of cycling’s Tour of Britain which was won by Austria’s Mattias Brandle after a four-man breakaway.

Wiggins finished in the peloton with Team Sky team-mate Ben Swift the best placed Briton in fifth.

Brandle (IAM Cycling) was in the day's four-man breakaway alongside Andreas Stauff (MTN-Qhubeka), Maarten Wynants (Belkin) and Shane Archbold (An Post-Chainreaction).

The decisive moment of the 177.3-kilometre route from Exmouth came not on Dartmoor, but on the drag into Exeter up Stoke Hill, with Brandle prevailing.

Brandle won by eight seconds from second-placed Archbold, who beat Wynants in a two-up sprint, while Bardiani CSF's Sonny Colbrelli led the peloton in 14secs behind in fourth.

Friday’s 128-mile stage is from Bath to Hemel Hempstead.
