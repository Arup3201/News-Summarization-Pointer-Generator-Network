The ancient fossil of a 40 million-year-old ‘walking whale’ has been unearthed by Peruvian palaeontologists.

The fossil, which has legs that resemble its land-based ancestors, could provide a link between how today’s sea mammals evolved from amphibious to aquatic creatures.

The discovery was made in the vast Ocucaje Desert in southern Peru- an area famous for being a treasure trove of ancient marine discovery.

This is the first time that such an old sea mammal has been found in South America. 

‘We already knew about the paleontological richness of Ocucaje dating back 10-12 million years,’ palaeontologist Rodolfo Salas told Euro News.

‘Now we can say that the most important primitive sea mammal deposit in South America is at Ocucaje.’

Up until now, evidence of ancient sea mammals such as this had only been found in Egypt, Pakistan, India and North America.

The 40 million-year-old fossil in Peru, belongs to a group called 
Achaeocetes.

These are ancient sea mammals that still show some of the 
characteristics of their land-based ancestors.

In the past 30 years, fossil finds have shed light on the sequence of evolutionary transformations.

It is thought that the first whale ancestor was a furry, four-legged omnivore that evolved into a range of amphibious species 50 million years ago.

Over time, whales lost the connection 
between their backbone and hind legs, then gradually lost the hind legs completely.

Whales are thought to have evolved into fully aquatic species around 45 million years ago.

The whale belongs to a group called Achaeocetes, which are ancient sea mammals that still show some of the characteristics of their terrestrial ancestors. 

Fossil finds over the past 30 years have shown how a sequence of evolutionary transformations, between 52 and 40 million years ago, led to today’s whales living in the oceans rather than on land.

So far, fossilised remains of over 15 of the majestic marine mammals have been discovered in the Ocucaje desert some 310 kilometers (190 miles) south of the capital Lima.

'There is probably a greater number of fossils in the sand but it takes high-tech equipment to locate and recover them,' said Cesar Chacaltana, who heads a team during a tour of the site, which spans 45 square kilometres.

It is thought the bodies were preserved by the low level of oxygen in the substrate, which delayed decay caused by bacteria.

In February last year, experts located the remains of a minke whale believed to be 3.6 million years old.

'It is a species known only in Peru,' Mr Chacaltana said, estimating that the whale weighed about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) and measured six meters in length.

In 2008 researchers found remains of a sperm whale (Livyatan melvillei) that were 12 million years old.

A decade ago, Mr Chacaltana also came across the jaw and three-meter skull of a giant shark, considered a mega predator, that lived off the Peruvian coast.
