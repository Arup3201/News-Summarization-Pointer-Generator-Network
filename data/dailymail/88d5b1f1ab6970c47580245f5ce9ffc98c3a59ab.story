A Colombian politician has slammed singer Shakira for ‘promoting lesbianism’ in her latest music video for her collaboration with Rihanna.

Marco Fidel Ramirez is calling on Colombia's National Television Authority to ban the video of her tune ‘Can't Remember To Forget You’ from being broadcast on any of the nation's channels.

The Public Option party councillor, from the capital of Bogota, said the video ‘damages the moral character of the youth of Bogota, Colombia and Latin America.’

Controversial: Rihanna and Shakira appear together in the video for Can't Remember To Forget You

He
 dubbed the 37-year-old Colombian singer, who appears in various 
provocative positions with Rihanna, a reference point for a society in 
moral decay.

Mr Ramirez, a 
self-styled ‘defender of morals and principles’ said the pair should be 
ashamed with the song he claims also promotes tobacco use, stealing and 
killing.

‘Our Shakira with 
her erotic video is promoting tobacco usage and has become the worst 
example for our youth,’ he wrote on his Twitter feed.

‘Shakira's
 new video is a shameless case for lesbianism and immorality. It is a 
danger to children,’ he added, using the hashtag #PeligroVideoShakira, 
which translates to ‘Dangers of Shakira's Video.’

Ramirez,
 who said the video was ‘simply gross’ and nothing more than an 
‘apology’ for lesbians, added: ‘It sends a provocative message to weak 
people who can be polluted and induced to practice (lesbianism).’

Hold on tight: Rihanna enjoys a faux sapphic moment with Shakira

The video, starring Shakira and Rihanna, 25, has already racked up more than 62million YouTube views.

It
 begins with Shakira on a bed singing about the mistakes she's made in 
love and moves on to the singer getting up close and personal with 
Rihanna, as the pair gyrate against a wall, cavort on a duvet and 
sensuously smoke cigars.

Shakira became an international success with her 2001 album Laundry Service, but gained fame in her home country in the mid-90s.

This is not the first time Shakira has been a topic of discussion in Latin American politics.

The singer dated Antonio de la Rua, the son of the former president of Argentina, Fernando de la Rúa, for 11 years.
