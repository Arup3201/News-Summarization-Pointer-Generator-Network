A father has taken the internet by storm by expertly recreating a selfie his son posted on Facebook.

Peri Anderson, from Ottawa, Ontario, told Today.com that he came up with the idea to reenact the photo of his son Joshua, 20, and a female friend after reading an article about parents copying their kids' selfies.

'I commented on his link that I should do this to you and he said, "Yeah? Go ahead. I don't know who would be more embarrassed - you or me,"' recalled Mr Anderson. 'So I took it as a challenge.'

In his imitation selfie, which he shared on Twitter, Mr Anderson strikes a pose with his wife Deborah, Joshua's step-mom. He pulls a smirk while wearing his son's grey T-shirt and black baseball cap.

In the foreground, Deborah holds the smartphone with both hands, a sticker placed on her chest to emulate the floral tattoo sported by Joshua's friend Sammy in the original photo.

After getting the approval of his son, Mr Anderson posted the side-by-side photos on Reddit, where they were quickly picked up by Imgur and garnered more than two million views.

And despite Joshua's original comment about embarrassment, it seems neither parties are ashamed of the photos.

'We did this in a mocking tone, but in a loving way,' explained Mr Anderson.

'It wasn't to be mean or embarrass him with his friends, and he took it that way. He wasnâ€™t mad at us at all.'

He added that Joshua's selfie partner Sammy also had no hard feelings about the spoof. 'Nobody was embarrassed at the end, so it's all good,' he said.
