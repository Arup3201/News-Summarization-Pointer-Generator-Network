The race for a seat may be foremost in the minds of the millions of commuters who swarm London's transport network each weekday morning.

But these fascinating archive photographs reveal the sheer scale of the work that went into building the stations and lines that continue to keep the capital moving more than a century on.

Some of the photographs date back as far as 1868, and offer the city's workforce 'something to think about next time you top up your Oyster Card', the Museum of London said.

Many of the historic pictures are the work of Henry Flather, who
took a series of 64 photographs in the late 1860s to document the 
construction of the railway from Paddington to Blackfriars, via 
Kensington, Westminster, and the new Victoria Embankment.

Railway
workers, or 'navvies', used the 'cut-and-cover' method to build the 
first underground railways before the development of the tunneling 
shield by James Henry Greathead. The first tunneled, or 'tube', railway 
in London was the City & South London Line, which opened its doors 
in 1890.

.

Sharon Ament, 
director of the Museum of London said: 'Millions of Londoners hop on the
tube or take a train each day, but it’s easy to forget what magnificent
feats of engineering these building projects were under Queen 
Victoria’s reign.

'The railway age transformed the face of
London and the layout of the city that we know today, without the 
modern technology that projects like Crossrail benefit from. Something 
to think about next time your top up your oyster card.'

'At the Museum of London we tell the story of the world’s greatest city and its people. Our photography collection is particularly unique, and provides a glimpse into all aspects of London life during the second half of the 19th and 20th centuries,' she added.

From King's Cross to Waterloo, the photographs reveal how London looked at the dawn of the city's 'railway age'.

In one of Mr Flather's pictures, the skeleton of what is now High Street Kensington Station's arched roof as construction on the building was underway in the 19th Century, while another shows rings of brick arching being laid over two steel frames as builders worked to create the Metropolitan District Railway.

The London Underground celebrated its 150th anniversary this year.

The first section of the Metropolitan Line opened from Paddington to Farringdon in January 1863.

Finishing touches: The exterior of Gloucester Road station on the Metropolitan and District Railway line, which was opened on October 3 1868

Standing the test of time: The signage still reads Metropolitan & District Railways at Gloucester Road Station

Break in proceedings: A group of railway construction workers, or 'navvies', pose for the camera beside a steam crane in Praed Street, Paddington

Glimpse of the past: A view of the forecourt of the Southern Railway terminus at London Bridge, originally built in 1836

How it looks now: The forecourt at London Bridge station, which is flooded with commuters during rush hour from Monday to Friday

Backbone of the city: This photograph shows the roof of Kensington Station - later renamed High Street Kensington - under construction

Impressive: The vast interior of the completed High Street Kensington Station - then known simply as Kensington Station - captured by Henry Flather around 1868

Recorded for posterity: Photographer Henry Flather's portable darkroom can be seen on the tracks inside the completed Bayswater Station

Tunnels: Workers are seen roofing over a cutting to form twin tunnels, with five rings of brick arching being laid over two steel frames, during construction of the Metropolitan Line

Before the rush hour: A construction site to the west of Waterloo Bridge and the foot of Savoy Street, as building work was underway on the Victoria Embankment and the Metropolitan District Line

Our work is done: The completed interior at Notting Hill Gate Station captured by Henry Flather

Modern methods: More recent construction work underway on the Crossrail link at New Oxford Street in the heart of the city
