Tony Pulis believes Joey Barton 'probably had a point' when claiming West Bromwich Albion's players 's*** themselves' during defeat to Queens Park Rangers earlier this season.

In December West Brom were two goals up but lost to a Charlie Austin hat-trick, leading to Barton's scathing judgement and plunging Alan Irvine to the brink of the sack.

Barton said then: 'West Brom went 2-0 up and I turned to Dunney (Richard Dunne) and said, 'they've scored too early.' They don't know how to get over the finishing line.'

The teams meet again at the Hawthorns on Saturday with Pulis having instilled a solid core to the point Albion have not conceded after scoring first in a game.

'Whatever Joey says or whatever he does he's entitled to hid views and his opinions,' Pulis said. 'The club were 2-0 up and lost 3-2 so he most probably had a point, or he felt he had a point to say something on that subject.'

Pulis recalled his own misfortune from leading 2-0 and losing as Gillingham manager in the Second Division play-off final of 1999.

'I've managed teams that have been 2-0 up with only for or five minutes to go and ended up drawing then losing on penalties. 1999 Man City Wembley,' he added. 'So I can't talk about being indestructible in respect to leads.

'We've played really well I don't think they've just been good results. The performances have been really, really good. We're hoping we'll continue that now.'
