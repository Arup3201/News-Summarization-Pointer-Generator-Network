The language of love has gone digital through text messages and social media – and it's even affecting the way we flirt.

Research has found we are more likely to poke someone on Facebook than ask them out on a date.

And the poll revealed that the reason for the trend is that 38 per cent find chatting to someone we fancy too embarrassing.

Technology  is leading to people shunning the direct approach for less bold ways of telling a potential date that they are interested with many opting for a Facebook poke rather than asking someone out for a drink

The poll was commissioned by online comparison site broadbandchoices.co.uk who surveyed 2,000 British adults.

Almost one in five people said they mostly use private Facebook messages to communicate while dating, while others thought a phone call or text message was more forward than a face-to-face chat.

Just over a quarter said they opt for Snapchat when trying to impress someone they like.

Researchers from Brigham University recently found that relationships may suffer because hi-tech communications can lead to couples 'disconnecting' with each other on serious issues.

'The bottom line is that if you don’t have something nice to text, better not text at all,' concluded the report.

The report found that for women, using text messages to apologise, work out differences or make decisions was associated with a more unhappy relationship.

For men, very frequent texting was associated with a poor relationship.

However, both men and women agreed that expressing affection via text enhanced a relationship. 

While 50 per cent of people are confident enough to ask someone for a date face-to-face, a third confessed they would be too embarrassed or nervous to pick up the phone and call a love interest.

However, the poll also revealed modern technology does have its downside when it comes to flirting.

One in seven people admitted they had accidentally sent a 'naughty' message to the wrong person - with more than a fifth of red-faced flirters sending it to a parent, while one in 10 admitted sent it to the 'wrong' partner.

Brits can be sheepish when it comes to ending relationships too with one in eight owning up to dumping a partner by text, while one in 20 (five per cent) said they had sent a private Facebook message, and a brutal three per cent admitted posting a public break-up message on Facebook.

Behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings said: 'If you're confident and looking for something fun and casual over the Christmas season, WhatsApp and Snapchat are great places to start.

'If you want something potentially a little more meaningful - or don't want to reveal, or see, anything naughty - stick with text messages or Facebook.

'If you want someone to know that you mean serious business and you're prepared to be bold, pick up the phone.

'It shows real effort and confidence - and could lead to a festive fumble.'

Old fashion approaches like talking face-to-face or even picking up a telephone appear to be a dying art as people prefer to hide behind technology when asking out a potential date for a drink

A quarter of people use Snapchat to impress a potential date rather than talking to them face to face, however, using technology can backfire when users send naughty messages to a parent or another partner by mistake

Even when in relationships, Brits are self-conscious with more than half the people polled (53 per cent) saying they wouldn't have 'in a relationship' on their Facebook profile after six months of being together, with almost a quarter (23 per cent) citing the reason as feeling they hadn't been together long enough.

A further seven per cent even said they felt a year wasn't long enough to announce their relationship on Facebook.

Dominic Baliszewski, telecoms expert at broadbandchoices.co.uk, said: 'Digital dating and social media have only been around for a relatively short time but it is fascinating to see how they have altered the way we interact with one another, particularly for people seeking new relationships.

'All that online interaction can eat through your mobile data, so make sure you have a plan with enough of a download allowance to avoid any untimely interruptions to your service.'
