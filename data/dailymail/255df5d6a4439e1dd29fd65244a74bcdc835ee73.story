Mohammed Bashir, 26, wrote the offensive post while high on cannabis after speaking with friends about a break-in at his local mosque

A Muslim shopworker has avoided jail after calling for a man who broke into his local mosque to be beheaded, and offering a £1,000 reward for whoever carried out the deed.

Father-of-two Mohammed Bashir, 26, was accused of a 'moment of madness' after posting a CCTV image of the culprit on trading site Gumtree, along with a note reading 'Reward, Beheading'.

Bashir wrote the message while high on cannabis after a thief stole £4,000 from the Jamia Mosque  near Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he is a member, on January 4.

Oldham Magistrates' Court heard the mosque had posted the image on their own Facebook page asking for the criminal to be identified, but after smoking drugs with friends, Bashir decided to take things a step further.

Angered by the break-in the day before, Bashir, who works in a nearby Morrisons, logged on to his Gumtree account and made the offensive post, before going to pick up his daughter from school.

The court was told that when Bashir sobered up shortly afterwards he went to remove the advert, only to find that it had already been deleted by Gumtree.

However the message had been online long enough for a panicked shopper to take a picture of it and send it to police, after which Bashir was arrested.

He later admitted the incident to police, telling them he had 'acted stupidly', and adding that he had been chastised by the mosque, his family and his friends.

Bashir was ordered to complete 80 hours unpaid work and pay a £60 victim surcharge and £85 fine

In mitigation, defence lawyer Naila Akhtar said her client had been married for nine years and has two children aged 3 and 6.

She said since Bashir’s arrest his name and address had appeared on an English Defence League website.

Miss Akhtar said: 'Mr Bashir had admitted that this was a moment of madness and completely out of character.

'He has been condemned by the mosque, his family and his friends for his actions for which he has taken full responsibility. 

Oldham Magistrates' Court heard that Bashir offered the reward after a man broke into this mosque in Werneth, Greater Manchester, where he is a member, and stole £4,000

'Police have said that he has been fully cooperative and is deemed a low risk. He was not thinking of the impact this action would have especially considering the current climate.

'Police are satisfied that there is no level of extremism and his religious views are not at a level of concern.'

Miss Akhtar added: 'He says he never takes drugs or alcohol but that on this occasion after smoking the cannabis decided to post the ad on Facebook using CCTV images from the mosque Facebook page.  

'Mr Bashir works two jobs, seven days a week since he was 16, his manager even sees him as a son and she says this is totally out of character for him. 

'After his job his main priority is supporting his children and his wife. His life has been considerably affected by his actions which has caused him great anxiety. 

Bashir said he tried to remove the post after 15 minutes, but discovered it had already been deleted. During that time a shopper had also discovered it, taken a picture, and sent it to police

'His actions have even had a negative impact on the mosque he attends as well as others in the area. He accepts that this is his fault.'

The court heard another of Bashir’s children Elizabeth died in 2013 after she swallowed a battery in a tragic accident.

Passing sentence JP Kathleen Kershaw said: 'We feel that this was a moment of madness to which you showed a good response and was very cooperative with police. We hope that we do not see you again Mr Bashir.'

Shortly after Bashir was arrested, the mosque removed the CCTV image and posted a message saying: 'We are all outraged at this despicable crime but we must act with cool heads and wisdom.

'The last thing we want is one of our own getting in trouble for something they may have said in (justified) anger.'
