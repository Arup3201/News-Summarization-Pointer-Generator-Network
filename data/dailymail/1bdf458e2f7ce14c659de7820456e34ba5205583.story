Poignant cartoons by a member of the Great Escape forgery committee who were executed by the Nazis in World War II following their now infamous break out have emerged.

The accomplished caricature sketches of several RAF officers held at prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III were produced by Flight Lieutenant Henri Picard.

The talented artist was one of the 76 escapees to make it out of a 350ft long tunnel under the camp before guards spotted the mass break-out.

These are two of the drawings created by Flight Lieutenant Henri Picard - one of 50 Allied men executed by the Nazis after they escaped from Stalag Luft III. It is thought the cartoons are of the man's roommates or other members of the Great Escape Forgery Committee who successfully fled the camp via a tunnel in 1944

F/Lt Picard had previously survived his own great escape. In 1942 he bailed out of a stricken plane and spent five days adrift in a dinghy in the North Sea before being captured.

He was not as lucky two years later in the more famous escape bid that was immortalised in the 1963 Steve McQueen film, The Great Escape.

After getting out of the camp he and comrade F/Lt Gordon Brettell were caught during a document check on a train 100 miles away in Nazi-occupied Poland.

The two men were among 18 escapees who were driven to a forest near Danzig and shot by the Gestapo four days after the break-out.

In all, 50 of the 76 men were executed on the orders of Adolf Hitler.

The three men in F/Lt Picard’s drawings are thought to either be members of the forgery committee for the Great Escape or F/Lt Picard’s room-mates at the PoW camp.

It is likely the sketches were rolled up and collected by an Allied prisoner while the camp was hastily cleared by the Germans as the Russians advanced across Poland.

They were recently spotted for sale by an eagle-eyed dealer at a fair.

Experts from Bosley’s Auctioneers on Marlow, Bucks, were able to identify the artist and their connection with Stalag Luft III.

The drawings are now being sold with a pre-sale estimate of £1,200.

Bernard Pass, of Bosley’s, said: 'The person selling them has no connection with Henri Picard, they are bargain hunter who spotted them at a fair.

'The artist’s name is on them along with the date they were produced so it didn’t take too much effort to identify who the artist was.

The break-out was immortalised in 1963 film The Great Escape, starring Steve McQueen as Captain Virgil Hilts USAAF and Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett DFC RAF (pictured)

The Stalag Luft III murders were committed by members of the Gestapo on order of Adolf Hitler on March 25 1944.

Of 76 escapees, 73 were recaptured - mostly within a few days of the break out. 50 of those men were executed in the forest near Danzig.

The deaths caused outrage. So much so, that in June of that year, Foreign Minister Anthony Eden announced in the House of Commons that those guilty of what was then a suspected war crime would be 'brought to exemplary justice.'

Following the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, the Police branch of the Royal Air Force, with whom the deceased had been serving, launched an investigation into the killings.

Wing Commander Wilfred Bowes, OBE headed the 15-man probe which tracked down, arrested, and interrogated the alleged war criminals responsible for the murders.

Many were tried and convicted - with 13 hanged.

A decision was made by the British government  after 31 August 1948 not to prosecute any more people involved.

'One of the men in the drawings was 
Flight Lieutenant William Barrett who was at Stalag Luft III from March 
1942 to January 1945 when the troops were moved out.

'I think the three men were either part of the forger team or were room-mates of Picards.

'The three works were probably put up 
on the walls and then maybe just grabbed them and rolled them up when 
the camp was evacuated.

'They were drawn on normal paper and there are a few creases in them.

'They are quite poignant considering who the artist was and what happened to him.'

F/Lt Picard was a member of the Belgium Air Force who transferred to the RAF after the fall of France in 1940.

He flew Spitfires in 350 Squadron and was shot down on bomber escort duties in August 1942.

Seriously wounded in one leg, he bailed out and drifted for five days and six nights in his tiny dinghy, suffering from his wound as well hunger and thirst.

His craft was thrown up on the French coast and he fell into Germans hands.

At Stalag Luft III F/Lt Picard was part of the team that copied real ID papers and passes.

In all, three tunnels - called Tom, Dick and Harry - were dug by more than 600 Allied airmen over a 12 month period beneath the PoW camp near Zagan in Poland.

In March 1944, 76 men crawled the 348 feet to freedom through ‘Harry’ - the single greatest escape during World War Two.

But 73 of the escapees were soon captured.

The auction takes place on July 2.
