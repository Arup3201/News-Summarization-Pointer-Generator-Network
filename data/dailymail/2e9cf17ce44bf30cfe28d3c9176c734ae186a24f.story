From Premier League lightweights to World Cup heavyweights, the transformation in some of English football's most disappointing imports has been quite remarkable.

From Bolton to Rio, Merseyside to Recife, these players have swapped anonymity in the English winters for dancing to the Samba beat on the grandest stage of all at the World Cup.

Bryan Ruiz – Costa Rica

Signed for £10.6million in 2011, the Costa Rican playmaker was jeered off the field against Manchester United three years - and just eight goals – later.

The forward’s fleetness of touch has never been in doubt and his flicks and tricks have, on occasion, drawn gasps of wonder from the Craven Cottage crowd but his inability to produce consistently led Fulham supporters to view Ruiz as a scapegoat as the club’s form disintegrated under Martin Jol.

Loaned out to PSV in January and now likely to move on permanently following Fulham’s relegation.

Pablo Armero – Colombia

Armero was signed on loan in January by West Ham manager Sam Allardyce but made just five appearances, with the Hammers losing four of those assignments.

The World Cup, though, has been a different story for Armero, with the full-back embracing Colombia’s high-tempo, attacking football, opening the scoring in the win over Greece and impressing once more in the victory over the Ivory Coast.

Shkodran Mustafi - Germany

Just as David Moyes though his reputation could barely take any more blows to the system, along comes Shkodran Mustafi, the youngster that the former Manchester United manager released on a free transfer after handing him just one appearance as a substitute for Tony Hibbert during a Europa League match against BATE Borisov.

Mustafi joined Everton from Hamburg in 2009 but did not appear in the Premier League and was released in 2012, joining Sampdoria, where the defender has flourished, culminating in a World Cup place and a second-half substitute appearance against Ghana in the 2-2 draw on Saturday evening.

Blerim Dzemaili – Switzerand

Signed by Sam Allardyce for Bolton at the age of 20, the Swiss midfielder arrived at the Reebok Stadium with great expectations but was immediately set back by a serious knee injury and made just one appearance for the club in a 2008 home defeat inflicted by Sheffield United.

The midfielder, though, managed to reinvent his career in Italy, enjoying spells with Torino, Parma and now, Napoli, where he made 28 appearances last season. His wonderful free-kick in the 5-2 defeat by Switzerland remains the only direct free-kick to be scored in Brazil so far.

Gary Medel - Chile

The self-anointed ‘pitbull’ lost his bite as Cardiff meekly surrendered to relegation under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but in the colours of Chile, Medel has been a Rolls-Royce at the heart of a back three, anticipating danger and using the ball with composure and accuracy.

Cardiff can expect plenty of interest both at home and on the continent – Valencia are keen - for one of the most impressive defenders on show in Brazil.

Chairman Mehmet Dalman is determined not to make a loss on a player who cost an initial £10million to the Welsh club, with wages in the region of £35,000-a-week.

Jo – Brazil

A relic from the days of Manchester City’s kamikaze spending, the £19million Jo struggled to make an impact in the Premier League after signing from CSKA Moscow, scoring just thirteen goals in three seasons at Manchester City - a period which also included loan spells with Everton.

A return to his homeland with Internacional and Atletico Mineiro has resurrected his international career, although it is admittedly helped by the paucity of options available to Brazil in the forward positions.

Yet to start at a game at the World Cup but did appear to represent an upgrade on Fred when he came on against Mexico.

Reza Ghoochannejhad - Iran

In Iran, they call him Gucci. At Charlton, they sing: ‘We’re calling him Dave.’

The Valley locals will be shaking their heads at the man who scored one goal in seventeen appearances since signing for Charlton in January, and then headed to Brazil to terrorise Argentina’s superstars in a scarcely believable performance of courage, organisation and quality by Iran.

Finding his form: Charlton striker Reza Ghoochennejad almost got on the score-sheet against Argentina for Iran

Julio Cesar – Brazil

A Champions League winner with Inter Milan, Cesar was actually one of QPR’s most impressive performers in that wretched campaign that saw their frenetic approach to the transfer market result in relegation.

Loaned out to Canadian side Toronto to offset the club’s spiralling wage bill. From relegation at Loftus Road to World Cup glory in the Maracana - via a pit stop in Toronto - would make for quite the 18 months.

Giovani Dos Santos – Mexico

Recruited with the reputation of being one of Barcelona’s most exciting young talents, Dos Santos failed to live up to expectations at Tottenham Hotspur, completing ninety minutes on just six occasions in between loan spells with Ipswich Town, Racing Santander and Galatasaray.

It would be an exaggeration to say that Dos Santos has set this World Cup alight for Mexico but he has forced the prolific Javier Hernandez out of the starting line-up, who boasts 35 goals in 64 starts for Mexico.

The Manchester United striker's record of an international goal every 1.83 games is better than that of Cristiano Ronaldo (goal every 2.3 games) and Lionel Messi (goal every 2.2 games).

Gervinho – Ivory Coast

It is quite difficult to believe that Gervinho - who glided and tricked his way past a host of Colombian defenders to score one of the individual goals of the tournament against the Ivory Coast - is the same Arsenal flop that scooped an open goal over the crossbar on a freezing December night at Bradford just 18 months ago.

A fine season for Roma has been followed by two goals in two games in Brazil. Maybe the winger had a point when he commented earlier this year: ‘The fundamental difference between the Roma and Arsenal is the coach. Garcia here gives me confidence, I know that he believes in me. What I learned at Arsenal? Honestly, not so much, because you cannot learn a lot if you're on the bench.’
