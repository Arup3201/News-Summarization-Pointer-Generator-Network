Thousands of people will die from extreme heat because health and safety rules stop hospitals opening windows, a shocking report claims.

New research suggests the number of deaths during scorching British summers is set to treble to 7,000 by the 2050s. 

Houses, hospitals and care homes are ill-equipped to deal with a heatwave, sparking calls for a maximum temperature to be imposed on wards.

Top-floor flats and terraced houses are particularly at risk of overheating because of insulation and difficulting opening windows, the report said

The combination of an ageing population and climate change increasing the likelihood of extreme heatwaves means thousands more people are at risk.

The Committee on Climate Change, which advises government on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, said more needed to be done to adapt to rising temperatures.

By 2040 half of all summers will be as hot as 2003, when 2,000 people died.

It warns of an increase in droughts, strong winds and wildfires, while ‘many homes, hospitals and care homes are already at risk of overheating’.

It suggests that the Care Quality Commission should ‘consider setting standards for maximum temperatures in hospitals and make sure staff can control internal temperatures’.

Around 90 per cent of hospital wards are prone to overheating, and the ability to control temperatures is often limited.

Lord Krebs, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the country needs to adapt homes to cope with heatwaves

Staff have only limited control over conditions because window opening has been restricted over health and safety fears, according to soon-to-be-published Cambridge University research.

The work on hospitals has been led by Professor of Architecture Alan Short whose research group has been looking at ways to cool wards without resorting to costly air conditioning which could exacerbate the climate problem,

It found that while the Department of Health advocates natural ventilation for wards and offices, the policy was often thwarted because window opening had been restricted over fears about safety, infection control and security.

The cost of installing the necessary improvements across 627 buildings was put at around £17.5 billion.

Lord Krebs, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, said: 'There is more to be done to counter the increasing risks of severe weather that are likely to be associated with climate change.

'As well as making vital infrastructure services more resilient to flooding and storms, the country needs to adapt homes and other buildings so they are suitable for higher summer temperatures.

'The impacts of climate change on the UK in the decades ahead are likely to include rising sea levels, more flooding, summer heatwaves, and perhaps more frequent storms and droughts.’

Newer homes are more likely to overheat. Top-floor flats and terraced houses are particularly at risk, as well as homes because they struggle to create a through-flow of air.

‘Examples of causes of overheating included improperly ventilated communal areas in blocks of flats, and an inability to open windows,’ the report said.

Reducing indoor temperatures by 1-2C can cut annual heat-related mortality by 30-70 per cent.

While better roof insulation and window upgrades can cool a room by 1.3C, insulated floors and walls can push temperatures up by 0.7C.

To fit new and exitsing homes with air conditioning would cost £2.4billion over 15 years.

Cheaper alternatives include shutting curtains during the day, applying tinted window film and painting roofs white.
