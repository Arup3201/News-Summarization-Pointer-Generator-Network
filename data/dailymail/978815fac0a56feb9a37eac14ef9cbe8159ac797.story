Didier Drogba trained with Chelsea on the eve of a possible Champions League return to prove his fitness following an ankle problem.

The 36-year-old, who rejoined the Blues this summer, missed Saturday's win over Swansea because of the problem.

Manager Jose Mourinho may be tempted to make changes with Sunday's Premier League trip to Manchester City in mind, while Ramires could start after impressing as a substitute against Swansea.

Mourinho has no other injuries to contend with as he looks to lead Chelsea to their third Champions League final but first under his stewardship.

Diego Costa is set to play his first European game for the club after helping Atletico Madrid dump the Blues out of last season's competition at the semi-final stage.

The Spanish international recovered from a hamstring injury in time to face Garry Monk's side on Saturday and scored a hat-trick to take his total for the campaign to seven.

Courtois, Cech, Ivanovic, Luis, Fabregas, Zouma, Ake, Ramires, Oscar, Hazard, Drogba, Mikel, Schurrle, Salah, Remy, Costa, Matic, Willian, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Boga, Baker, Beeney.
