Triple-killer: Ian McLoughlin, 55, was given a 40-year jail term for murder

A judge who refused to give a triple killer a whole life sentence because of a European human rights ruling was wrong, the  Government’s most senior law officer ruled yesterday.

Mr Justice Sweeney had said last month that it was ‘not appropriate’ to sentence Ian McLoughlin to die behind bars because Strasbourg judges had ruled such terms were a breach of human rights.

But yesterday the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, declared the 40-year jail term to be too soft, and referred the case back to the Court of Appeal.

He said a whole-life tariff ‘ought to have been made on the facts of the case’.

A spokesman said: ‘After careful consideration, the Attorney General has decided to make a reference to the Court of Appeal in relation to the sentence of Ian McLoughlin for the murder of Graham Buck.

‘McLoughlin received a  sentence of life imprisonment with a 40-year minimum term.

‘The Attorney General considers that a whole-life order ought to have been made on the facts of the case and that the sentence was therefore unduly lenient.’

Three Court of Appeal judges will consider the case within weeks and could increase the sentence if they agree with Mr Grieve.

McLoughlin, 55, butchered good samaritan Graham Buck, 66, while on day release in July from an earlier prison term for murder.

Mr Buck was fatally stabbed in the neck when he interrupted McLoughlin robbing the home of an 87-year-old neighbour  Francis Cory-Wright.

McLoughlin was on day release from HMP Spring Hill, Buckinghamshire, where he was serving a 25-year term for the murder of  Brighton barman Peter Halls whom he stabbed multiple times in 1992.

He had already served time for the 1984 killing of Len Delgatty, 49, who he had hit over the head with a hammer, and so was expected to be put behind bars forever.

But sentencing him at the Old Bailey on October 21, the judge said he could not pass a whole-life term.

Call for review: Attorney General, Dominic Grieve has declared the 40-year jail term to be too soft and that the Court of Appeal consider the sentence based upon the facts of the case

Britain is the ‘best pupil in class’ for obeying edicts from Strasbourg, a senior eurocrat declared yesterday.

At a Westminster hearing, Thorbjorn Jagland, secretary general of the Council of Europe, said the rest of the continent looked to the UK to set an example on human rights.

He then claimed that if the UK did not obey the diktat on  prisoner votes, it would set a bad example to countries such as Russia.

And he warned that Britain’s international influence would be diminished if it decided to go for the ‘nuclear possibility’ of not complying with the ruling.

His comments angered MPs. Dominic Raab said: ‘This is yet more patronising drivel from the eurocrats.

‘The idea we should sacrifice democracy at home to promote the European agenda abroad is a Faustian bargain Parliament should reject.’

He told the court the whole-life order was a breach of Article three of the European Convention and it was ‘not appropriate’ to impose such a term.

The judge was following a Strasbourg ruling made in July which said whole-life terms were unlawful.

But its decision is not binding on domestic courts and ministers have not yet declared how they will respond.

The judge’s decision was criticised on the day by Justice  Secretary Chris Grayling.

He said: ‘We are considering the Government’s response to the ECHR’s recent ruling but this in no way alters that fact and courts should continue to impose whole life tariffs where they wish to do so.’

Yesterday the Buck family’s MP, Mike Penning, said: ‘McLoughlin has killed three times, on separate occasions.

‘It beggars belief we are unable to pass a whole-life sentence because of his human rights.

‘Mr Buck’s family, and the whole local community, deserve justice and I am pleased the Attorney General agrees that the sentence is unduly lenient and is going to refer this case to the Court of Appeal.’
