Two is company and three is a crowd, as the saying goes.

And on the most romantic day of the year, most enamored couples may want to take advantage of a little alone time.

But it seems Pope Francis has other ideas as to how twosomes ought to spend Valentine's day - as he has invited engaged couples to the Vatican for to meet him in person on February 14.

A very special Valentine's day: Pope Francis has invited engaged couples to a private meeting at the Vatican on February 14

A note, entitled 'The Joy of Yes Forever'
 issued by Vatican city invites engaged, heterosexual couples to a 
private audience with the Pontiff next month.

'Engaged couples who have already attended or are presently attending marriage preparation courses are invited to a meeting with the Holy Father,' the statement said in several languages, reports Asia one.

Organised by the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Family, participants are required to register by January 30 to secure their place.

Earlier this week the Pope, who has been hailed as one of the most modern leaders of the Church, baptised the child of an unmarried couple in a ceremony in the Sistine Chapel.

Pope Francis baptised 32 children in a mass ceremony in the Sistine Chapel including those of unmarried couples

He has previously spoken out against priests who refuse to perform the sacrament on the offspring of unmarried couples, describing them as 'hypocrites'.Â 

'You parents have the baby boy or girl to be baptised, but in a few years it will be they who will have a baby to be baptised, or a grandchild... And so goes the chain of faith,' he said according to the Vatican network.

'What does this mean? I would just tell you this: you are the ones that transmit the faith, the transmitters, you have a duty to pass on the faith to these children.

'It 's the most beautiful legacy that you leave to them: the faith.'
