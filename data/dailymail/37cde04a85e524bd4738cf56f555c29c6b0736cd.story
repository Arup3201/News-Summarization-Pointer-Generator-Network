Tourists visiting Buckingham Palace when it opens for the summer season will be able to experience a taste of royal hospitality for the first time. 

Paying tourists will now be allowed to enter the State Rooms through the Grand Entrance - just like a visiting head of state - as they are given unique insight into the preparations that go into hosting opulent state banquets, investitures, garden parties and private audiences.

As such, this year's annual summer opening exhibition is entitled, A Royal Welcome, as the Palace reveals just how it copes with the 62,000 guests it entertains each year.

Forthcoming exhibition, A Royal Welcome, will reveal exactly how Buckingham Palace prepares for its opulent events, like state banquets

Anna Reynolds, the curator of the summer season exhibit, prepares a silver gilt centrepiece, which will be on display from June

In the ballroom, the horseshoe shaped table will be set for a state banquet, complete with silver gilt centrepieces, candelabra and 170 place settings using 2,000 pieces of cutlery.

Also on display will be the Grand Service, which has been used by successive monarchs for 200 years and was originally commissioned by George IV when he was Prince Regent.

It consists of 12 ice-pails, 14 soup tureens, 118 salt cellars, 140 dishes, 288 dinner plates, 58 dessert stands and centrepieces, and 107 candelabra.

Each year, the Palace hosts 62,000 guests, many of whom will eat dinner in the ballroom at a horseshoe shaped table

A mustard and salt cellar from 1721 is among the items used at state banquets, and will be included in the summer opening display

A nautical themed silver gilt salt cellar is another item that will be available for paying tourists to view during the summer season

Little known facts will also be revealed during the exhibition.

For example, at a state banquet, a special salt cellar with two compartments for salt and mustard, originally acquired by George I, is placed in front of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

A newly commissioned time lapse film will also show how the grand room is transformed for the elaborate banquets, which are hosted for foreign heads of state who are carrying out formal visits to the UK.

Visitors will also have the chance to see the copper moulds used to create chocolate bombe desserts, the red leather seating planner and evening dresses and glittering jewellery worn by the Queen at high-profile state affairs.

Other outfits on display will be hats and ensembles worn by the Monarch to her garden parties.

Evening dresses and glittering jewellery worn by the Queen herself at such high-profile state affairs will also be available to view

There are usually three garden parties held at Buckingham Palace every year, each with 8,000 guests who consume around 27,000 cups of tea, 20,000 sandwiches and 20,000 cakes.

The exhibition will also include the knighting stool and knighting sword used by the Queen and other members of the royal family to confer knighthoods at investitures.

This year's summer opening of the state rooms at Buckingham Palace - which includes the exhibition A Royal Welcome - will run from July 25 to September 27, 2015.
