A new menu of one-dollar 'cravings' has been unveiled by Taco Bell with around a dozen items priced for a buck.

11 choices, some of which have been around for a while, are priced at $1.00 each.

The fast-food chain has introduced its menu as other fast food chains such as McDonalds have been moving away from their one-dollar concept and towards a more value-orientated price board.

However, for some options on the dollar menu, charging $1 for some items actually represents an increase in price.

$1.00 menu: the fast food chain unveiled a new "Dollar Cravings" menu, with around a dozen items priced for a buck. For the historically cheap chain, in some cases that actually represents an increase in price.

Going up: Soft potato taco was 99 cents but will now cost a dollar

Filling: Triple-layer nachos - The $1 price point for these items is meant to present a compelling and tempting alternative

The chain already had four items on the menu for less than a dollar.

The Cinnamon Twists and Cheesy Roll-ups used to cost 89 cents, and the Potato Soft Tacos and Caramel Empanadas were 99 cents each.

They're now on the dollar menu, meaning they’re actually more expensive.

Taco Bell will earn a little extra money on a few items, and the chain expects customers to buy more than one item.

SPICY TOSTADA - A crunchy tostada shell topped with hearty beans, crisp lettuce, real cheese, tangy red sauce and creamy chipotle sauce.

SHREDDED CHICKEN MINI QUESADILLA - Shredded chicken combined with a three cheese blend, folded in a freshly grilled flour tortilla.

SPICY POTATO SOFT TACO - A warm soft tortilla filled with crispy potato bites, real cheddar cheese, crisp shredded lettuce and creamy chipotle saucE

CHEESE ROLL-UP - A flour tortilla rolled up with a three cheese blend melted to perfection.

CARAMEL APPLE EMPANADA - A crispy golden pastry pocket filled with chunks of warm apples in creamy caramel sauce.

TRIPLE LAYER NACHOS - Freshly prepared, crisp tortilla chips, hearty beans covered in warm nacho cheese sauce and topped with a tangy red sauce.

CHEESY BEAN AND RICE BURRITO - Hearty beans, cilantro rice, warm nacho cheese, and creamy jalapeno sauce wrapped up in a flour tortilla.

BEEFY FRITOS® BURRITO - Seasoned beef, Frito® chips, and cilantro rice wrapped in a flour tortilla and filled with warm nacho cheese sauce.

BEEFY MINI QUESADILLA - Seasoned beef combined with creamy chipotle sauce and a three cheese blend, folded in a freshly grilled flour tortilla.

CINNAMON TWISTS - Crispy, puffed corn twists, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.

CINNAMON DELIGHTS - Warm, golden bite-sized pastries filled with Cinnabon® frosting and covered with Makara® cinnamon sugar.

Going up in price: Cinnamon Twists and Cheesy Roll-ups used to cost 89 cents but is going up more than 10%

New addition: Beefy fritos. The move comes at a time when other big players in fast food, notably McDonald’s and Wendy’s, have been shifting away from dollar menus toward more value-oriented pricing

'Consumers loved getting their own variety of dollar menu items to create their own unique meals,' said Stephanie Perdue, vice president of brand marketing.

As the price rises at other chains, Taco Bell wants to stand out by staying low.

'What we heard from customers is that they’re looking to get the most for their dollar,' said Perdue. And having $1 items - no matter how few - remains important.

Other options on Taco Bell’s new Dollar Cravings menu include the Shredded Chicken Mini Quesadilla, Beefy Fritos Burrito, Spicy Tostada, Cheesy Bean and Rice Burrito, and Triple Layer Nachos.

The $1 price point could be a compelling and tempting alternative to options like the McDonald’s Jalapeno Double.

Overall, Taco Bell has always been historically cheap with offers like burritos for 59¢ and 79¢.

The $1.00 menu could mean that some customers might actually end up paying more as they buy more of the 'cheaper' options.
