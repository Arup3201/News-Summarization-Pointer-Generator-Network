Australia captain Michael Clarke will miss next month's one-day international series against Pakistan because of the hamstring injury which ruled him out of much of the recent tour to Zimbabwe.

Cricket Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris has explained Clarke's injury is more serious than first hoped, and the 33-year-old batsman must therefore sit out the ODI leg of his team's final tour - to be played in the United Arab Emirates - before they host the World Cup next winter.

Kountouris said: 'Since returning to Australia, Michael has had a series of investigations that have confirmed a significant hamstring injury.

'Importantly, the scans have demonstrated tendon damage - which complicates the recovery from this injury.

'As such, he will not recover in time to be available for the ODI series in the UAE.

'We hope he will be available for the Test series, but this will be determined at a date closer to the first Test.'
