'Frightened': Sir Michael Gambon collapsed while rehearsing at the National Theatre

Sir Michael Gambon’s memory has deteriorated to such an extent that he was twice rushed to hospital from theatres after forgetting his lines.

The 72-year-old actor revealed that he collapsed while rehearsing at the National Theatre due to an ‘overwhelming fear’.

But despite the desperate rush to St Thomas’ Hospital in London, doctors found nothing wrong with the Harry Potter actor.

Speaking about his shock collapse, 
Sir Michael said: ‘I think it’s linked to the memory.

'It was a really 
major, big part. I think I got so frightened that I collapsed.

'They did 
all sorts of tests of me and they couldn’t find a thing.’

The
 incidents in 2009 eventually forced the actor to pull out of the 
production The Habit of Art, blaming his absence on ‘ill health’ at the 
time.

Speaking
 about his decision not to appear as W H Auden  in the play, he told The
 Times: ‘It’s rather sad.

'And then they recast it [with Richard 
Griffiths].

'I couldn’t do it. That is linked with what is wrong with me –
 overwhelming fear.

The actor accepted the problem was a result of ageing and said it was ‘dangerous’ for him to continue in theatre.

He said: ‘I have never admitted this before, so all these producers don’t know. So I’m lucky in as much as I get away with it.’

Sir Michael plans to appear in Eh Joe , a one-man show in which he does not have to remember any lines. ‘It’s like a dream being offered this part,’ he said.
