A schoolgirl who dreamed of becoming a scientist hanged herself after she felt pressurised to study six A-levels, her family said yesterday.

Lisa Wilks, 17, desperately wanted to do well when she started the courses last autumn so she could go to a good university.

But, an inquest heard, she was stressed and upset in the run-up to sitting 15 exams in her subjects – chemistry, biology, maths statistics, psychology, religious education and general studies.

The teenager studied at Blackpool Sixth Form College (pictured). Principal Felicity Greeves said: 'The entire College was deeply shocked and saddened by Lisa's death. She was a bright and ambitious student'

On the day before her first paper last May, she was found dead by her father Derek, 46, an IT consultant, at the family’s home.

Her mother Christine, 55, said in the weeks before, Lisa had spoken of wanting to hang herself as a way of avoiding her exams.

Her family, of Thornton Cleveleys, near Blackpool, told how the teenager had felt under pressure to get A or A* grades.

Mrs Wilks said: ‘Everything reflects back on the teachers and the institution but it all comes back to the students.

Christine Wilks said her daughter 'was very loving and very kind and brought a lot of happiness to everybody'

‘Kids are told they can’t fail. They feel that even a B is not good enough. The adults are driving them and they forget the kids are already clever enough without being pushed further.’

She said Lisa had been put in a class of students at Blackpool Sixth Form College who had all been tipped for places at Oxford or Cambridge.

The mother-of-three added that Lisa also felt pressure because she had been allowed to study chemistry despite not achieving high enough GCSE grades.

But she took on the massive workload and was coping as best she could, said her mother, a former librarian. She added: ‘The 15 exams were her biggest worry.

 ‘She didn’t want to do it. Having to study for that many A-levels made her very angry.

‘It was the pressure she was under. It was added to as she was a very driven person. She would do everything to the best of her ability.’

At the inquest in Blackpool, Mrs Wilks said: ‘She felt she’d done all she could do and was getting to the point where she was sick of chemistry. A ‘B’ grade would have been good enough for most but not Lisa.’

She said the family had put her daughter’s remarks about suicide down to exam nerves brought on by the pressure she felt under.

‘I think she was unhappy at college,’ said Mrs Wilks. ‘We had a discussion saying she didn’t have to be at college. She thought giving it all up would be an admission of failure. All that studying would go to waste. She thought she was stuck.’

Coroner Alan Wilson recorded a verdict of suicide. He said: ‘Clearly there has been reference to her feeling pressure about her exams but there is a lack of evidence to suggest the issue in relation to exams was probably a causative feature.’

College principal Felicity Greeves said: ‘Lisa was a bright and ambitious student who was doing well academically. She impressed all her tutors with her commitment.

‘We have an excellent record of providing pastoral support. Tragically, in Lisa’s case there was no indication she was having any difficulties within college or outside.’
