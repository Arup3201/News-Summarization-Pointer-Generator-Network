A Republican-led congressional committee created to look into the 2012 Benghazi, Libya terror attacks has formally asked Democratic former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton to deliver her now-famous secret email server to a neutral third party for examination.

The same committee has already subpoenaed the emails of 'close to a dozen' people who worked in the State Department for Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, the chairman of the U.S. House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks said on Thursday.

South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, the committee's chairman, wrote to Clinton's lawyer to say he expects her to give the email server to the State Department's inspector general or another unbiased examiner for an independent determination of which emails and other records should be in the public domain – or at least archived by the government.

He gave Clinton an April 3 deadline to make a decision, saying he would urge House Speaker John Boehner to take action if she ignores his request.

'Though Secretary Clinton alone is responsible for causing this issue, she alone does not get to determine its outcome,' Gowdy said in a statement. 'That is why in the interest of transparency for the American people, I am formally requesting she turn the server over.'

'An independent analysis of the private server Secretary Clinton used for the official conduct of U.S. government business is the best way to remove politics and personal consideration from the equation. Having a neutral, third-party arbiter such as the State Department IG do a forensic analysis and document review is an eminently fair and reasonable means to determine what should be made public.' 

Gowdy's committee has authority to subpoena documents and individual witnesses, but not pieces of computer hardware. That would require a criminal search warrant signed by a federal judge, and Clinton is not thought to be under investigation for any crime.

The hard-charging former prosecutor had told Reuters earlier on Friday that aides to Clinton and perhaps 'aides to aides' would find themselves subpoenaed.

'We sent a subpoena to the State Department for emails from a number of individuals within the State Department, other than Secretary Clinton,' Gowdy, a Republican, said in a phone interview with the news service.

Separately, pressure mounted Friday on the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with a new wrinkle in the flap over the nationality of many of its six- and seven-figure donors – many of whom, it has been revealed, have ties to foreign governments.

Former President Bill Clinton had promised the Obama administration that his family philanthropy would turn down money from foreign governments themselves while his wife was secretary of state.

But a Wall Street Journal investigation has established that it willingly accepted large contributions from more than a dozen foundations and companies and people who might be surrogates for overseas regimes.

They included a member of the Saudi royal family, a 'Ukrainian oligarch' who once served in the nation's parliament, and many government-linked businessmen, according to the Journal.

Overall, the twelve gave between $34 million and $68 million after Hillary took over the State Department. Exact numbers can't be gleaned from available documents – only ranges.

The Ukrainian could be problematid for Mrs. Clinton because it involves millions from the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, run by a businessman who has been a strong advocate of his country establishing closer ties with the European Union.

Pinchuk also served two terms in Ukraine's parliament. Much of his foundation's donated funds came to the Clinton Foundation while the State Department was pushing for Europe, and against Russia, as a dominant force in Ukraine.

It's unclear whether the foundation flap or 'email-gate' will prove the greater irritant to Mrs. Clinton's growing presidential campaign momentum.

But a New York Times report this month that she had exclusively used a personal email account for government business while the chief U.S. diplomat from 2009 to 2013 has reinvigorated the Benghazi committee's investigation into the attacks that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. 

Clinton is the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic nomination even though she has yet to formally declare her candidacy.

She has come under scrutiny from Republicans who accuse her State Department of failing to protect diplomatic personnel.

Gowdy said the State Department had asked him not to disclose the names of people whose emails were sought.

Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, insists he's not interested in Clinton's private communications, but wants to elarn if she discussed the 2012 Benghazi terror attack outside the reach of government document-retention mandates

EMAIL-GATE: Clinton has been dogged by accusations that she hid work-related emails from the State Department by relying exclusively on a private email server hosted in her home

But without their emails, he has argued, no congressional committee investigating the Benghazi attack could claim to have issued a definitive report.

On Thursday Mrs. Clinton said Washington politics has become too partisan, appearing at a national meeting of camp counselors.

She told the American Camp Association in her final paid speech before an expected presidential announcement that America's political class could use 'camps for adults' to foster cooperation.

Meeting organizers presented her with a gray sweatshirt emblazoned with 'Camp David' – the presidential retreat in Maryland –  but otherwise steered clear of her prospective campaign, pointing to a 'huge fun deficit' in the nation and the need for politicians of all stripes to reach across the aisle.

'We really need camps for adults,' Clinton said. 'Maybe mix it up a little bit' so Americans 'have to come together and actually listen to each other. Wouldn't that be a novel idea?' 

As she faces partisan criticism over the email mess, Clinton has said that although she should have used a government email account, she violated no rules.

Democrats say that Benghazi has been thoroughly investigated by several congressional panels and that Gowdy's committee's efforts are politically motivated and aimed at undermining Clinton's expected presidential candidacy.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters the committee 'has spent millions of dollars; produced nothing.

I think we're going to just see an ongoing attempt to investigate Hillary Clinton, whatever the subject, whether it's her emails or it's her hair or whatever it happens to be.'

Gowdy spoke to Reuters on the same day Senator Charles Grassley sent letters to Secretary of State John Kerry and the State Department's inspector general asking for information on the emails of Huma Abedin, who was a top aide to Clinton.

Grassley said he was probing Clinton's use of a program that let some of Clinton's allies, including Abedin, do private sector work while also working for the government.

Gowdy said he was not coordinating his probe with Grassley, and rejected any suggestion that the State Department might become overworked with requests for information about Clinton and her aides.

The revelations about Clinton's emails have raised questions about the State Department's email practices.

Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House minority leader, predicted Republicans would keep pressure on, 'whether it's her emails or it's her hair or whatever it happens to be'

Earlier on Thursday, U.S. officials said the State Department does not automatically archive the emails of its assistant secretaries of state, contradicting the department's prior public statement.

Gowdy said no decisions had been made in the House of Representatives about when Clinton would be called to testify, either about her email use or about the Benghazi events.

He had said earlier that he hoped to call Clinton to testify in April.

On Thursday Gowdy said the slowness of responses to his requests for information from Clinton and the State Department had delayed that timetable.

He said he wanted all relevant documents before she appears.

The Benghazi Select Committee also subpoenaed all communications of Clinton's related to Libya this month, but neither Clinton nor the State Department have produced documents in response to the subpoenas, Gowdy said.

Earlier the State Department gave the committee 300 of Clinton's emails related to Benghazi.
