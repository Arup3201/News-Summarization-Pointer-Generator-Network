Usually after committing a crime the perpetrator attempts to scarper.

But one man has reportedly begged cops to arrest him after he punched a pedicab driver and tried to steal the vehicle.

The drunken 35-year-old also allegedly urinated in a Darwin city alley during his bizarre Friday night antics.

Hijacked: A drunken man stole pedicab in Darwin at around 4.30am on Saturday morning and demanded police arrest him

Police say the man was from Larrakeyah an inner suburb of Darwin, the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory.

He had reportedly just left Monsoons nightclub with a friend when he hailed the pedicab.

They were standing outside the popular club on Mitchell Street at about 4.40am.

'A short way into the journey he demanded the driver stop so he could get out and urinate on the street,' Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen told the Northern Territory News.

'While he was relieving himself he began to argue with and abuse the driver.'

The intoxicated punter then allegedly swung a punch at the bewildered driver.    

In his mission to take control of the pedicab, he pushed over the driver and jumped into his seat.

He only made it to nearby Austin Lane in his unlikely getaway vehicle before a passing police patrol was flagged down to stop him.

Supt Jorgensen said the pedicab thief 'demanded they arrest him'.

He was in police custody on Saturday and is now facing charges of assault, disorderly and offensive behaviour.
