Police in the US have charged a man with murder of a 26-year-old woman whose drowning in 2003 was initially ruled an accident. 

Daniel U. Perez, 52, appeared in court via a video link from the Sedgwick County jail in Wichita, Kansas, on 39 criminal counts, including rape, child sexual exploitation, and the premeditated murder of Patricia Hughes.

Court documents indicate that Perez and Ms Hughes were living with a group of people in central Kansas that has now been linked to several deaths.

Daniel U. Perez, 52, appeared in court via video link yesterday having been charged with the murder in 2003 of 26-year-old Patricia Hughes.

Investigators initially believed the 26-year-old mother accidentally drowned while trying to rescue her 2-year-old daughter from a swimming pool at a home in  Valley Center, a city just north of Wichita, where the group was living at the time.

But last September Ms Hughes' death was reclassified as murder amid evidence that the group was living off life insurance policies.

The group of people lived together in at least three different states, either in one large home or in houses in close proximity, and was living in Valley Center at the time of Hughes' death, according to Martin Bauer, the lawyer for Ms Hughes' parents, who were recently granted legal guardianship of their now 11-year-old granddaughter.

Two criminal complaints unsealed on Thursday show that Perez is facing numerous charges, including one count of sexual exploitation of an 8-year-old child and 11 counts each of rape and sodomy.

He also is charged with making a criminal threat as well as several counts each of aggravated assault involving a rifle and making false statements to obtain credit from a Wichita car dealership.

He also is accused of making false statements on life insurance applications in 2006.

The girl's maternal grandparents won custody in 2010, after federal and state investigators alerted them that the child could be in 'imminent danger'.

'There is a pattern that members of a group associated with the person using the name of Lou Castro have followed of insuring members of the group and then living off the proceeds of the life insurance policies when one of them dies,' Mr Bauer wrote in a July 2010 filing seeking custody for the grandparents.

The judge found that the girl was in 'imminent danger' and granted the maternal grandparents guardianship.

Filings in that guardianship case in Kansas indicate detectives told the grandparents in 2010 that the man they knew as Lou Castro was in fact Perez, who had been convicted of sex crimes with a child in the 1990s but had fled before sentencing.

Investigators also told the grandparents about the federal case filed against Perez in Kansas for aggravated identity theft.

In that case, he was listed at the same address in Tennessee, more than 800 miles from Kansas, where their granddaughter was living at the time.

Sedgwick County District Judge Warren Wilbert yesterday set bond at US$2 million pending a preliminary hearing on 2 February.

The charges were initially filed in September but they were kept under seal while Perez finished serving a federal sentence for identity theft in Oklahoma before being extradited to Kansas to face the state charges.

Perez's court-appointed attorney, Alice Osburn, did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press for comment.
