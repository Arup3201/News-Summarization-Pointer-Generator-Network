The moment a machete-wielding armed robber made off with £18,000 from a security guard has been caught on camera by a brave motorist who then chased him in his van.

Bystander Philip Hoare, 41, filmed on his mobile phone as he tailed the attackers, giving police a running commentary as he drove.

It came after Ricky Maidment, 27, threatened a G4S guard as he delivered money to a Tesco Express store in Fordingbridge, Hampshire.

The moment a machete wielding armed robber wrestled £18,000 from a security guard has been caught on camera after a brave motorist chased them in his van

On the run: The robber is seen on the footage making off with the cash deposit box containing £18,000

Bournemouth Crown Court heard that the armed robber then ran towards a waiting Land Rover where accomplice Gary Allen, 41, was waiting before racing away from the scene.

Allen sped 'erratically and dangerously' through residential streets and country roads in a bid to lose Mr Hoare.

At one point they managed to get the cash free from the secure box it was in and threw the box towards the windscreen of his van in a bid to stop him.

But the demolition company boss - a father-of-two - was able to swerve out of the way.

Mr Hoare stopped a cyclist travelling in the other direction and told him to wait by the box until officers arrived to collect the vital evidence.

The 15-minute chase continued until the Land Rover headed down a private dirt track that was impossible for Mr Hoare to negotiate in his van.

But thanks to his detailed commentary, police were already waiting at the other end of the track, blocking off the escape route.

Within seconds, the pair from Salisbury, Wiltshire, were arrested and the full £18,000 recovered.

Mr Hoare was not meant to be in Fordingbridge that day but ended up there by mistake when he took a wrong turn.

He said adrenaline just took over after he saw Maidment waving the knife around and threatening the guard, on March 5 this year.

Mr Hoare said: 'I know I would have wanted somebody to have done something if it was me, so I did what I could.

'I can’t stand bullies and this guy had a machete over this poor security man’s head. I had to do something.

'I don’t consider myself a hero. My wife said I was mad but I think anyone else would have done the same.'

The court heard Allen had only agreed to be the getaway driver because he was desperate to raise the cash he needed to visit his terminally ill stepson in hospital.

He had been visiting Jake, 19, at Salisbury Hospital where he was being treated for cystic fibrosis, the court heard.

But a recent move to Southampton General Hospital, Hampshire, meant the daily visits had become more expensive.

Allen, a tree surgeon, met Maidment at Salisbury Hospital and initially refused the chance to make some extra money.

But he finally agreed to act as the getaway driver after work slowed and doctors revealed his stepson has just six months to live.

Allen, who has no previous convictions, and Maidment, who has a long criminal record, admitted one charge of armed robbery.

Judge Samuel Wiggs jailed Allen for 32 months, saying his case was 'exceptionally tragic' and the term was the 'very least' he could impose.

He added: 'I am sorry that you have let your family down in this way. I am sorry for the inevitable effect this will have on your son.'

Maidment was jailed for four years eight months and was given a concurrent one-year jail term for possessing a blade.

Frank Abott, defending, said the robbery had been masterminded by a third party who recruited Maidment due to his long record.

The man was questioned by police but not charged.

Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Bob Rees, from Hampshire Constabulary, said Mr Hoare had been 'crucial' in detaining the suspects.

He added: 'I consider Mr Hoare a hero. He monitored, he filmed, he gathered evidence for us and put himself at risk doing so.

'But he remained calm and collected, acting in an intelligent and considered manner. The investigation would have been much more difficult and protracted if it was not for his intervention.'
