Campaign of terror: Andrea McWatt, 64, of Didsbury, Greater Manchester, targeted a couple in a series of attacks that made them fear for their lives

A retired employment judge carried out a three-year campaign of terror against her neighbours and threatened to kill them by leaving her gas on.

Andrea McWatt, 64, of Didsbury, Greater Manchester, targeted Mark Dale and his wife Helen, who have a 20-month-old son, in a series of attacks that made them fear for their lives.

Manchester Magistrates’ Court was told that in one terrifying incident McWatt - also a former solicitor - shouted: ‘I am going to kill you all. I am going to leave the gas on and kill your family’.

McWatt also hammered on dentist Mr Dale’s walls, and once stood on her balcony singing to loud music until 7am. She was first given a restraining order against the Dales last October.

But she has since breached it twice. McWatt was brought back to court in January but again continued to torment Mr Dale and his family by shouting, swearing and hammering on walls for hours on end, said prosecutor Matthew Siddall.

McWatt pleaded guilty to breaching the order for a second time in May. But Mr Siddall said matters came to a head when the Dales heard McWatt shouting threats to kill them and their family.

She also opened all her windows and stood on her balcony singing to loud music until 7am.

She has now been sentenced for the second breach and was given a 12-month community order to co-operate with the probation service.

District Judge David Clarke said the restraining order would continue indefinitely. The judge also ordered her to pay the complainant £100 compensation plus £150 costs and a £60 surcharge.

Mr Dale said because of the threats he had expensive safety checks done on his gas supply.

He said in a statement: ‘This has caused us great anguish. We have considered moving but the property is unsaleable due to her behaviour and we would have to disclose this to any buyer.’

Mrs Dale said: ‘McWatt has made our lives unbearable. I am scared for my 20-month-old son and pet dog. I feel I cannot enjoy my own home and garden because I am scared of what she may do next.’

Helen Dale

McWatt claimed she had very little contact with the complainants. But the judge told her: ‘I don’t accept you are blameless in this matter.’

McWatt, who has been staying in a hotel in Manchester city centre, said she was going to sell her flat and move to Norfolk.

When approached for a comment, she said: ‘You’re finished. You can print what you want, because your energy is blocked by God.’
