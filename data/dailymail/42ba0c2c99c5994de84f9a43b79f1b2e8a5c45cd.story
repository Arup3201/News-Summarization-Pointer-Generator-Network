The father of one of the British drug mules jailed for attempting to smuggle cocaine out of Peru has revealed his daughter is living in 'horrendous conditions' in prison. 

Billy Reid said there would be no Christmas celebrations at the Reid family home in Glasgow until his daughter Melissa was freed from jail.

Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly were jailed for six years and eight months last year after they were caught with £1.5m worth of cocaine hidden in their luggage, which they attempted to smuggle out of Peru.

Mr Reid said his daughter, 21, had already missed key events while she was in prison such as her 21st birthday and her brother's wedding.

Billy Reid, father of British drug mule Melissa, has described horrible conditions his daughter is enduring in a Peruvian prison after she was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to almost eight years in prison 

'It's had a tremendous impact on us both emotionally and financially,' he said.

'It's horrendous to see your daughter in handcuffs and the living conditions that she has to put up with. Melissa has spent her own 20th and 21st birthdays in prison in Peru.

'She missed the significant event of her only brother's wedding. Events such as Christmas are non-existent for us. There'll be no celebrations in our house, there'll be no Christmas tree until we get her back home.'

Mr Reid was speaking on a video filmed for a Home Office campaign, Mules are fools, Don't be an ass, aimed at deterring people from taking part in drug smuggling. 

In the 2013-14 financial year, 717 British nationals were arrested abroad for drug-related offences, according to the Foreign Office said - with arrests recently increasing in Australia, Spain and Turkey.

Shaun Attwood, who also features in the three-minute video, ended up in the prison with the highest death rate in America after being sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in Phoenix, Arizona for distributing ecstasy.

He said: 'I thought drugs were glamorous, I'd never get caught, my parents would never find out.'

'I had to get used to the sounds of heads getting bashed against toilets, bodies getting carried out on stretchers, people who looked like they were dead,' he added.

The mules are fools campaign aims to target young people who may be tempted to act as drug mules by warning them about the heavy consequences they will face serving long sentences in poor conditions in prisons abroad.  

James Duddridge, minister for consular affairs, said: When it comes to drugs our message is clear - don't take risks, it is never worth it. You only have one life so don't waste it.

'The consequences can be devastating for both you and your family and so it is important to be familiar with the local laws. Penalties and sentences vary considerably around the world and the FCO cannot interfere in another country's legal system. So stay safe and do not break the law.'

Pauline Crowe, chief executive of Prisoners Abroad, said: 'We urge people to consider the severe consequences of overseas imprisonment; from unsanitary conditions that breed disease and infection, to a severe shortage of food, clean water and the most basic of medical care.

'Overseas laws can be far harsher than in the UK and committing a drugs crime, whether intentionally or not, could result in a lengthy sentence in life-threatening conditions.'

Melissa Reid, 21, of Belfast, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, of Dungannon in Northern Ireland, were working in Ibiza.

The pair were arrested in August last year as they attempted to leave Peru airport. 

A search of their luggage revealed 24lb of cocaine, worth about £1.5million, was hidden within food packets. 

The two women initially denied that they had willingly taken the drugs and claimed Colombian drug lords who kidnapped them at gunpoint forced them to board a flight with the cocaine. 

However they later pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, saying they were doing so to get a more lenient sentence. 

They were both jailed for six years and eight months in December last year. 

Both women were sent to the Santa Monica prison in Chorrillo to begin their sentence, which will last until April 2020.

The jail - which is notorious for its crowded and unsanitary conditions - has housed most foreign women prisoners in the past.

The two women are still hoping to be transferred to Britain to serve their sentence under Britain's extradition treaty with Peru. 

Earlier this year José Luis Perez Guadalupe, head of Peru’s prison service, said the two women may be able to apply for release under an 'expulsion law' once they have served a third of their sentences.

If they are successful they could be freed in November 2015.
