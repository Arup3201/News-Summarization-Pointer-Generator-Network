Former Liverpool and Scotland striker Ian St John has revealed he is battling cancer.

Having had his bladder and prostate removed recently, the former Reds frontman has been told he requires further surgery.

Speaking to the Liverpool Echo from his home, St John has vowed to keep fighting the disease and said: 'The prognosis is not good because I’ve got to go back.

'But if they can sort it this time, then hopefully.'

'I’ve had bladder cancer for the last two or three years but it spread into my prostate and therefore the decision was made to remove both of them. That was done eight-10 weeks ago,' added the former international.

Following his retirement from the game, St John went on to form a famous partnership with former England striker Jimmy Greaves on television.

Greaves, who appeared on football show 'Saint and Greavsie' with St John, said: 'I am obviously well aware how unwell Ian is.

'I spoke to him on the phone at some length a couple of weeks ago and we had a very good chat and a good laugh about the coming World Cup.

'It goes without saying, me and my family wish him all the very best.'

Current Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has sent the former Anfield hero a signed shirt which St John insists he will wear when playing football with his grandchildren.

St John, who made 425 appearances for the Reds during a decade at the club throughout the sixties, has urged all men over the age of 50 to get themselves checked.

Having celebrated his 76th birthday last week the Reds legend is being nursed back to health at home by his wife Betsy.

The former striker also played for Motherwell, Coventry and Tranmere Rovers in a career spanning 16 years.
