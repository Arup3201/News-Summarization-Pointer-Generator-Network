With tempers flaring over the Scottish referendum, things in the UK are certainly hotting up – and temperatures across the country are likely to follow suit, rising to as high as 25C by the day of the vote.

Forecasters say the warmer end to the week will be down to a blast of hot air arriving from Europe, which could bring blue skies and sunshine.

The unseasonable weather will see Britain bask in temperatures on a par enjoyed by holidaymakers in Turkey and Spain.

And thanks to humid conditions, which make it harder to keep our body temperature under control, people in London and parts of the South could feel as though the day is even hotter – the equivalent of 30C.

The Met Office is predicting that virtually the entire country can look forward to a few days of unusually warm weather. Meteorologist Kirk Waite said: ‘High pressure is due to move from its current position over Scandinavia and draw warm air in from the Continent.

‘Most of the country can look forward to plenty of good spells of sunshine and temperatures in the mid-twenties.’

But according to forecasters, things may take a more unsettled turn towards the end of the month thanks to a tropical storm which is currently sweeping across the Atlantic.

Weather Channel UK spokesman Leon Brown said: ‘There will be increased instability with the risk of some heavy showers and thunder over the South by Friday.’

Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite said 'we did have quite a cool end to August, so it could be the first time temperatures have exceeded 25C since August 8'
