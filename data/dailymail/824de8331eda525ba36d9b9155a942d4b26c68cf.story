Resplendent in a sparkling black and silver mini-dress, a chunky cable knit jumper and a pretty Chinoiserie skirt, Victoria's Secret star Barbara Palvin shows she's more than just an underwear model in pictures from River Island's gritty new campaign.

Shot by leading photographer Angelo Pennetta, the nightime images show a glamorous Palvin eating Dim Sum and stalking the streets of London's Chinatown.

Palvin, 19, who is pictured wearing the High Street brand's autumn/winter 2013 collection, shot to fame when she made her debut for Victoria's Secret during last November's typically glamorous show.

Afterwards, she hit the headlines when she was rumoured to have become intimate with singer Justin Bieber, who performed at the show, although she later spoke out to deny the reports.

The new River Island collection, which will be available online from September, focuses on glamorous high shine metallics and monochrome, and was styled for the shoot by fashion favourite Beth Fenton.

The campaign comes hot on the heels of the brand's latest Rhianna for River Island collection, which was also unveiled this month.

And it seems that the second collection from the Barbadian singer has already scored one celebrity fan, after Cara Delevingne posted photos of her wearing Rhianna for River Island on Twitter

The 21-year-old model showed support for the 'amazing' clothes from the Right Now hitmaker's new range by posting a picture herself in a red quilted bomber jacket and black beanie hat from the 80-piece collection.

Support: Model Cara tweeted this photo of herself wearing her friend Rihanna's River Island collection

Accompanying the photo of herself in the Rihanna-designed garments, Cara wrote: 'Well done @rihanna for another AMAZING collection for River Island! #keepgoingboo #G4life #goldentouch http://instagram.com/p/dkSOP1jKIe/ (sic)'

Cara has previously admitted she often asks Rihanna for style advice. The catwalk star also speaks to veteran supermodel Kate Moss for tips on how to beat troublesome skin.

Cara recently said: 'It only happened during Fashion Week. Which is, of course, the worst time of the year for me to be covered in scabs.

'Kate Moss saw me before the Louis Vuitton show at 3am, when I was being painted by people to cover the scabs.

'She said, "This is horrible! Why is this happening? I need to help you." She got me a doctor that afternoon. Kate gives really good advice.'
