Let the insanity begin!

March Madness kicked off with a bang on Thursday with millions of Americans glued to the games to see how their brackets would fare in the early stages.

As the NCAA tournament brings out the bracketologist in all of us, one mathematician is encouraging people to keep expectations low because the odds are not in your favor.

After running the numbers, DePaul University Math Professor Jeff Bergen estimates there is only a one in 9 quintillion (that's a 9 followed by 18 zeros) of filling out a perfect bracket. Serenity now.

Numbers don't lie: DePaul Professor Jeff Bergen showed the chances of a person filling out a correct NCAA Baskeball Tournament bracket and they ain't good

Do the math: The mathematician showed that out of the entire U.S. population, the likelihood of someone filling out a perfect bracket is less than 1/4 of 1 per cent

Professor Bergen explained, 'If you're just guessing [while filling out your bracket], you basically have no chance.'

The Chicago university filmed the math whiz calculating the numbers in front of a whiteboard and as the computation unfolded, the results were enough to make even the most optimistic college basketball fan begin to despair.

He explained how there are 64 teams in total for the bracket but only 63 are entered into his formula, because every team besides the ultimate victor will lose one game.

There are two outcomes for each game and so to fill out a perfect bracket, someone must correctly predict the outcome for all 63 games.

Scientific methods: Engineering students at Georgia Tech have built a computer model that predicts the outcome of the college basketball tournament, with Florida chosen as the 2013 victor

Mathematically this can be explained by multiplying 2x2x2x2x2....63 times. That yields the astronomical number of 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 or  9 quintillion and change.

But that chance is for the ordinary Joe Blow who really knows nothing about the NCAA and just wants to take part in the office pool and experience the cultural phenomena that is March Madness.

The professor also created a formula that improved a person's chances of accuracy, only considering those filling out the bracket who actually know college basketball.

'If you know something about basketball, your chance of winning is one out of 128,000,000,000,' he said in the YouTube video to publicize his formula.

Working off the assumption that everyone in the United States had a working knowledge of basketball and filled out their brackets accordingly, the chances of one person correctly predicting the outcome for all 63 games are still pretty slim at less than 1/4 of 1 per cent.

'When your bracket goes down the tubes, don't worry so does everyone else's!' he said somewhat reassuringly.

Barack-etology: President Barack Obama filled out his bracket this week, selecting Indiana to win the NCAA men's basketball championship

But against all odds, engineers and scientists are still trying to put their knowledge to the test to predict the outcome.

Engineers at Georgia Techâ€™s Logistic Regression/Markov Chain (LRMC) college basketball ranking system have developed a computerized model to select the NCAA champ.

In the past five years they have correctly chosen the victor for three of those years.

This year, the model predicts Florida, Louisville, Indiana and Gonzaga will advance to the Final Four with Florida and Gonzaga playing for the title.

Florida was selected as the presumed winner, according to the model.

But as they say, those who can't...teach. Neither DePaul or Georgia Tech made the tournament this year.

Expert: Nate Silver estimates each teams' chances of advancing in the college basketball tournament

Even the president takes part in the madness.

On Tuesday, he unveiled his bracket predictions with Louisville, Indiana, Ohio State and Florida reaching the Final Four and Louisville and Indiana facing off in the championship.

President Obama believes the Hoosiers will claim victory.

'I think this is Indiana's year,' he said on ESPN, in a segment dubbed Barack-etology.

Coming off the heels of his successful presidential election prediction, statistician Nate Silver applied his logic to the college basketball tournament.

His bracket showed each team's likelihood of advancing forward, predicting Louisville as the most likely to win the title, with a 23 per cent chance of victory compared to Indiana (18.4 per cent), Florida (13.3 per cent), Kansas (8 per cent) and Duke (5.9 per cent).

After the agonizing hours spent trying to rationally predict the outcome, The Wall Street Journal's Dan Heath staged an intervention of sorts with his readers and provided a four step program for people to prepare to be disappointed with The Four Secrets of Bracket Psychology.

1. Distance yourself from emotion before deciding2. Prepare to be wrong3. Avoid confirmation bias4. Honor your core priorities

'Let's be honest: Your NCAA tournament bracket is probably not going to win,' he wrote in his piece on Wednesday, though in the interest of full disclosure he did admit that he himself had never filled out a bracket in his life.

With the likelihood of success at nil to none, college basketball enthusiasts should remember it really is about good fun.

In the end, the Aggies didn't make the tournament so how good could it really be?
