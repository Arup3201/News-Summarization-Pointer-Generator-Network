Broadcasters last night threatened to go ahead with televised election debates with or without David Cameron.

The ‘take it or leave it’ offer by BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel 4 came as bosses published revised plans that will now involve the leaders of seven parties.

Along with the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems and Ukip, TV executives have extended the invitation to the Green Party, the Scottish Nationalist Party and Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru.

The new plan also includes (left to right) Ukip's Nigel Farage, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon Green leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood

The PM had thrown scheduling plans into chaos after refusing to take part unless Green leader Natalie Bennett was offered a place at the podium.

Her inclusion will now put pressure on Downing Street to agree to the debates – even though ongoing unrest among other smaller and regional parties threatens to scupper the screenings altogether.

Broadcasters last night said they had made the changes after reviewing the ‘electoral landscape’ but issued a clear warning that they would ‘empty chair’ any leader who refused to turn up.

The Tories pushed for the debates to happen in 2010, when Mr Clegg was seen to have have triumphed over Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown

A spokesman for the TV companies said: ‘The party leaders will be formally invited to take part in these debates. In the event that any of the invited party leaders decline to participate, debates will take place with the party leaders who accept the invitation.’

The schedule will now feature two debates involving all seven leaders – one on BBC and one on ITV.

A third, on Channel 4 and Sky, will be a head-to-head clash between Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband only.

The Tories last night said the proposals were ‘being considered as part of the on-going discussions about the debates’. 

The new format appears less favourable to Mr Miliband, however, who will have to face several other parties that are directly challenging him for votes and seats.

Labour immediately insisted he would debate ‘anyone the broadcasters choose to invite’, claiming it was ‘surely now not possible’ for Mr Cameron to oppose participation in the debates.

The Lib Dems, who find themselves reduced to minor party status within the new television format, strongly opposed the latest plans.

They insisted that Nick Clegg – who triumphed in the debates before the last election in 2010 – deserved to feature in all the screenings because the Lib Dems are in government and want to ‘defend their record’.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage also opposed the inclusion of other minor parties.

He told ITV News: ‘What is the point of having the four major parties as defined by Ofcom and then Uncle Tom Cobley and all?

‘You can’t have a debate with seven people on the podium. 

'And if you’re going to have seven, you’ve got to have the Northern Irish DUP (Democratic Unionist Party). 

'They, after all, are the fourth biggest party in Parliament.’

The DUP’s leader, Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson, wrote to the broadcasters yesterday describing the new format as ‘unacceptable’. 

He said: ‘In light of the extension of the debates to smaller and regional parties, the failure of the broadcasters to invite the DUP to participate is inexplicable.

‘The broadcasters’ decision cannot logically or legally be defended.’

Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Peter Robinson said he would be writing to the BBC and ITV demanding an explanation for the exclusion

In a further potential hurdle, Sinn Fein – whose elected MPs do not even attend Parliament – said it would challenge any attempt to exclude it from the debates. 

A party spokesman said: ‘Sinn Fein will take every opportunity to present and promote its policies and positions.’

George Galloway, the Respect Party’s sole MP, has also demanded his inclusion.

The original proposal was for one debate featuring the PM and Ed Miliband, a second including Mr Clegg and a third with the addition of Ukip leader Nigel Farage.

The row over the exclusion of the Greens has sparked an apparent surge in support for the party, which saw it pick up several points in the polls and thousands of new members.

Leader Miss Bennett described the decision to include her party as ‘groundbreaking’ and the apparent surge in support as a ‘Green Spring’.

The group of major broadcasters said that since the initial proposal they had monitored ‘the electoral landscape’ and taken into account polling data and ‘expressions of public support for the debates to go ahead and for a wider range of parties to be included in the debates’.

The proposed dates for the debates are April 2, 16 and 30 – with the final clash exactly a week ahead of the General Election poll on May 7.
