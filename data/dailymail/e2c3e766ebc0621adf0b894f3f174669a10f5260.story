Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby insisted the nation's values were based on the Christian faith

Britain is a Christian country, the Archbishop of Canterbury insisted today in boost for David Cameron in his row with atheists about his Easter message.

Justin Welby said he agreed with the Prime Minister that the country's values had been ‘shaped and founded on’ the religion.

But he admitted that proof of the importance of Christianity to the UK could not be found in attendance numbers at church, which have continued to fall over several years.

Mr Cameron was criticised for saying 
‘we should be more confident about our status as a Christian country’ 
and ‘more evangelical’ about faith.

The
 Prime Minister also warned that people who ‘advocate some sort of 
secular neutrality fail to grasp the consequences of that neutrality, or
 the role that faith can play in helping people to have a moral code’.

The
 article provoked a response from more than 50 leading public figures, 
organised by the British Humanist Association, warning Mr Cameron risked
 sowing ‘alienation and division’ in society.

But
 Arshbishop Welby said the response to the PM’s comments had been ‘all 
quite baffling and at the same time quite encouraging’.

He said the Christian faith is much more vulnerable to ‘comfortable indifference than to hatred and opposition’.

Writing
 on his blog, he added: ‘It is a historical fact (perhaps unwelcome to 
some, but true) that our main systems of ethics, the way we do law and 
justice, the values of our society, how we decide what is fair, the 
protection of the poor, and most of the way we look at society... all 
have been shaped by and founded on Christianity.’

He added: ‘It is clear that, in the general sense of being founded in Christian faith, this is a Christian country.

‘It
 is certainly not in terms of regular churchgoing, although altogether, 
across different denominations, some millions attend church services 
each week.

‘Others of different backgrounds have also positively shaped our common heritage.

‘But
 the language of what we are, what we care for and how we act is earthed
 in Christianity, and would remain so for many years even if the number 
of believers dropped out of sight (which they won't, in my opinion).’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also gave his support to Mr Cameron – despite being an atheist.

Mr
 Clegg said Britain's history and heritage was ‘infused by Christianity’
 but people of ‘all faiths and none’ were able to share values of ‘fair 
play and tolerance’.

But he also called for the separation of the Church from the state.

On
 his LBC 97.3 phone-in show Mr Clegg said: ‘I'm not a man of faith but I
 don't find it particularly controversial to say, if you look at our 
history, heritage, our architecture, our values, of course it is infused
 by Christianity.

‘I'm slightly nonplussed by people getting very worked up about it.

‘I'm
 not a practising man of faith but I don't find it an issue to say we 
have an important Christian identity in terms of our history and 
heritage and so on.

‘That is
 not to say that somehow we are exclusively Christian, where everybody 
is a Christian or indeed that we have got one Christian denomination - 
there are almost as many Catholics as Anglicans in this country.

‘Of
 course we should remember that one of the greatest Christian values - 
if you want to put it that way - of tolerance, is that we are open to 
people of other denominations, other faiths, of all faiths and none.

‘It's the senses of fair play and tolerance that makes our country very special.’

Mr
 Clegg added: ‘Recognising our history and our heritage and who we are 
and have been over several centuries doesn't mean that you have to say 
you are a Christian to believe in tolerance and diversity, I'm just 
saying that actually they are not incompatible with each other, that's 
all.’

He said 
disestablishing the Church of England, separating it from the state, 
would be ‘better for Anglicans’ but accepted such a change would not 
happen overnight.
