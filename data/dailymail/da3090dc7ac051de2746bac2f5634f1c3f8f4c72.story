This young Jack Russell got a jolly good barking at when his lively antics went a step too far.

The three-month-old puppy, appropriately called Jackie, was pinned up against the wall by his seven-year-old mother Morha after he became a bit too boisterous.

His mother decided to step in to deal out the rough justice after Jackie had been harassing his ten-year-old grandmother Mowa.

Ticking off: Jackie the three-month-old Jack Russell is 'told off' by its mother

Wildlife photographer Jack Perks captured the action while walking with a friend and their pets on holiday in Halwill, Devon.

The telling-off didn't last too long however as they started to play together before carrying on with their walk.

He said: 'The dogs were making the most of the sun and the little one was bothering its grandmother.

'When Jackie's playful nature got a bit boisterous, his mother stepped in and seemed to tell him off by pressing him against the wall.

'But it was all in good fun as they had a play with each other before trotting on.'

The pictures offer a revealing insight into the relationship dynamics between dogs and their parents.

Rough justice: Jackie was given the stern telling-off after his mother became fed up of his boisterous behaviour

After the dog has been given its stern telling off he appeared a little crest-fallen, but quickly gather his wits before moving on.

It shouldn't come as too much of a surprise the young dog needs keeping in line every now and again - Jack Russell's are notorious for wanting to be the centre of attention.

They also have masses of energy and will always try to challenge authority. No wonder Jackie's mother was not willing to let him get away with his boisterous antics for too long.
