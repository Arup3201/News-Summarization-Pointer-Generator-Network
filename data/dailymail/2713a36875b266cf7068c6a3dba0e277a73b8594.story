Accused paedophiles are importing child-like sex dolls - but claiming they are harmless toys to avoid prosecution.  

One Sydney man is expected to fight a charge of possessing one of the dolls, insisting it is not child abuse material. 

A man has been charged with possessing a silicon sex doll, allegedly in the shape of a teenage girl.

In a case that is thought to be one of the first of its kind in NSW, the man will reportedly allege that he does not fit the legal definition of a child abuser.

If the defence of his case, thought to be the first of its kind in NSW, is sucessful, the 32-year-old  it could force the government to rethink what is defined as child sex abuse.

Police reportedly raided the man's house in January 2013 and found the child-like mannequin lying in his bed, dressed in a satin nightgown.

According to The Daily Telegraph, Police said the mannequin, which featured a removable silicon genital insert, was in the shape of a female 'approximately 12 to 14 years of age'.

Police also believe the mannequin was purchased via a Chinese website for $3667.

The Australian part of the site has since been taken down and the Chinese site has removed the 'child dolls' from their inventory.

The man is set to go before a court to claim that he does not fall under the child abuse category as there were no photos or videos taken of the mannequin.

The current NSW Crimes Act defines child abuse material as videos, images and literature but not physical objects.

The man's doll is 132cm tall and weighs  30kg.

His lawyer, Benjamin Goh, said the legal definition of child abuse material needs to be updated.

He said his client cannot be convicted until the definition of child abuse in NSW law includes inanimate objects.

'The government needs to make sure the law keeps up with what's on the market,' Mr Goh said.

'It is similar to when synthetic drugs were not captured under law — there were substances that had similar effects to LSD and ecstasy but were completely legal before the laws were changed.'  

Alleged paedophiles are reportedly importing sex dolls in the shape of young children from abroad and disguising them as props for film sets.

According to reports, a man from Narrabeen was the mastermind behind the Australian site.

He allegedly told customers he could disguise the dolls from customs, by writing that they were worth less than the actual sale price. 

The Narrabeen supplier was also charged with possessing child abuse material after police allegedly found more than 8000  images and videos on his personal computer.
