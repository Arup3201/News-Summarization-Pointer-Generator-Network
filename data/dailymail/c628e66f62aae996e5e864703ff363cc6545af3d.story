Britain was dragged deeper into the Iraq crisis last night as it emerged another 150 special forces troops are being deployed.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the mission had escalated beyond a humanitarian one and could last for months.

British forces are now helping Iraq to ‘combat’ the rise of Islamic State and its extreme form of terrorism, he said. And in his most uncompromising intervention to date, Prime Minister David Cameron warned that the situation may now require ‘military action to go after the terrorists’.

Change of tack: Michael Fallon, pictured meeting British forces at the RAF base in Akrotiri, Cyprus this weekend, said the mission had escalated beyond a humanitarian one and could last for months

He said the Islamist fanatics of IS had to be stopped before they became strong enough to launch attacks on British soil.

Mr Cameron spoke amid a series of dramatic developments on the ground that will fuel concerns about mission creep and prompt fresh demands for the recall of Parliament:

Mission: A RAF Tornado lands at RAF Akrotiri. British military planes are flying deeper into Iraq to capture surveillance footage of jihadist fighters

Purpose: Britain has limited its role to aid drops, surveillance and transporting supplies to Kurdish forces

The new deployment of 150 special forces troops is likely to begin later this week. It will include signals specialists and electronics experts with equipment capable of intercepting voice transmissions at a distance of more than 150 miles.

There will also be men from a new SBS unit which will be used to monitor sensitive areas of the Jordanian border.

Earlier, Mr Cameron said Britain should use its military prowess to stop Islamists creating ‘a terrorist state on the shores of the Mediterranean’. He said the UK was ‘in  the middle of a generational  struggle against a poisonous and  extremist ideology’.

The Prime Minister added: ‘If we do not act to stem the onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger until it can target us on the streets of Britain.’

Until now, Britain has limited its role to aid drops, surveillance and transporting supplies to Kurdish forces. But Mr Cameron, writing in a Sunday newspaper, said: ‘True security will only be achieved if we use all our resources – aid, diplomacy, our military prowess – to help bring about a more stable world.’

He added: ‘We need a firm security 
response, whether that is military action to go after the terrorists, 
international co-operation on intelligence and counter-terrorism or 
uncompromising action against terrorists at home.’

While
 saying he did not back full-scale military involvement and ‘sending 
armies to fight or occupy’, Mr Cameron left open the possibility of 
Britain taking on a more direct role in supporting Iraqi and Kurdish 
troops on the ground. 

Speaking
 on a visit to the RAF Akrotiri base in Cyprus, Mr Fallon said: ‘This is
 not simply a humanitarian mission. We and other countries in Europe are
 determined to do what we can to help the government of Iraq combat this
 new and very extreme form of terrorism.’

Mr
 Fallon revealed that troops from 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment 
flew in as part of preparations for a helicopter mission to save 
stranded members of the Yazidi group on a mountainside. They were on the
 ground for 24 hours before flying back to Cyprus after the operation 
was called off. 

Addressing airmen and soldiers at the 
base, Mr Fallon said: ‘This mission isn’t over. The humanitarian needs 
are there…There may well now be in the next few weeks and months other 
ways that we may need to help save life, protect people. We are going to
 need all of you again and the surveillance you are able to give us.’

Advance: A Kurdish peshmerga fighter close to the strategically important Mosul Dam, which Kurdish and US forces are poised to take back

In recent weeks IS fighters have 
seized vast swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, advancing towards Baghdad
 and prompting US air strikes.

Yesterday,
 US warplanes helped by Kurdish forces were on the brink of recapturing 
the Mosul Dam, which supplies water and electricity to northern Iraq, 
amid ‘fierce resistance’ from Islamists. It was reported yesterday that 
another 300 Yazidi men from the Sinjar mountain area are among their 
victims, with some beheaded in front of their own families.

British
 military planes are filming surveillance footage on jihadist fighters 
which is passed to the US and used to help Kurdish and Iraqi forces.   
The UK has more than 100 members of the SAS, SBS, Reconnaissance 
Regiment and signals specialists in Baghdad and  around Irbil.

Plight: Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community settle at the Qandil mountains near the Turkish border outside Zakho, 300 miles northwest of Baghdad

Support: Displaced Yazidis find shelter under a bridge. David Cameron has left open the possibility of Britain taking on a more direct role in supporting Iraqi and Kurdish troops on the ground
