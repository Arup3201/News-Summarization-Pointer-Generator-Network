From a transsexual Mona Lisa to a nude scratching her itchy armpit, these paintings are so bad they are good.

Once destined for the trash, they were saved by a lover of odd paintings and are now on display to thousands of visitors a year at a museum dedicated to the worst art in the world.

The Museum of Bad Art in Boston, Massachusetts, has now grown to three galleries and houses a collection of 600 terrible pieces.

From the slightly odd to the downright awful, the collection now receives hundreds of submissions from budding bad artists every month - but only the very worst are hung on the gallery's walls.

The museum is the only one on the U.S. dedicated to seriously awful art.

Louise Reilly Sacco, executive director of the museum, said: 'Our curators receive at least 20 submissions every month - but only about four or five make it into our collection.

'The museum only accepts artwork that is sincere and original.

'We
look for pieces in which something has gone wrong - it can be the work 
of a skilled artist who was trying something new or made an unfortunate 
decision.

'Or it can be created by an artist who barely knows which end of the brush to hold.Â 

Bizarre: A woman in a bikini stands unfazed stands in flames and this painting of a smiling woman gives her 'an air of frumpiness'

Atmospheric: The baseball game painting is celebrated for the batter's asymmetrical limbs and flexible bat

Haunting: The face (left) is the artist's portrait of his partner Lynn while the portrait (right) is an unflattering likeness of Joan Crawford

'In
any case, the work must be interesting and compelling. We favour pieces
that are clearly meant to communicate something to the viewer.'

Among the esteemed pieces are an unflattering portrait of Hollywood starlet Joan Crawford, an Asian woman who suffers an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction and two naked giants holding airplanes.

The jewel in the crown is 'Lucy In The Sky With Flowers', which inspired antiques dealer Scott Wilson to found the museum with his friend Jerry Reilly.

He found the painting - of an elderly woman walking through a field of flowers - in a rubbish bin and realised it was so bad it was good.

The piece is a commissioned portrait of Anna Keane that hung proudly in the family home until her daughter's death.

The painting became the first in Mr Wilson and Mr Reilly's collection of odd works of art that would never find their way into a traditional gallery.

Family: The museum praised the 'astonishing emphasis on facial bone structure' in 'Mama and Babe'

Portrait of innocence: A young girl, dressed in white and wearing a straw hat, picks daisies in a green field

Provocative: A nude who 'can scratch her back and armpit simultaneously' (left) and two naked giants play with blimps and planes (right)

Disaster-pieces: An Asian woman suffers an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction after sneezing

The museum now attracts about 8,000 people a year who visit to see the art and the synopses written underneath by the curators.

The inscription below Lucy In The Sky With Flowers reads: 'The motion, the chair, the sway of her breast, the subtle hues of the sky, the expression on her face - every detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait, every detail cries out "masterpiece."'

Ms Reilly Sacco said they write out of respect to the artist.

She said: 'We are the first institution to 
collect, exhibit, and celebrate these works that would otherwise never 
receive the recognition they deserve.

'We
do this while being respectful of the artists, and offering our 
interpretations of these heartfelt pieces in which something has gone 
awry.

'Everyone has the experience of walking past a gallery when a friend says "Wow! Look at that."

'Until you turn to look, you don't know if it will be very good or very bad. Either way, people want to share and talk about these pieces.'
