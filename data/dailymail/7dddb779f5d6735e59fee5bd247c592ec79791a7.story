Betrayal: Richard Hallam, 32, ordered drugs to bring on a miscarriage from China and then secretly administered them to his pregnant girlfriend

A cheating boyfriend who tried to abort his unborn child by secretly giving his pregnant partner miscarriage-inducing drugs has been jailed for 10 years.

Richard Hallam, 32, had been seeing another woman when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant with a child he didn’t want.

So he purchased an abortion drug called Mifemiso from a website in China, a court heard.

While he waited for the drugs to arrive, his partner who can’t be named for legal reasons began suffering complications with the pregnancy.

Hallam comforted her but the court heard he was also texting the company supplying the drug, saying he was ‘desperate’ to receive them.

Hallam, from Poole, later gave his unsuspecting girlfriend the drug without her knowing.

The horrified woman only discovered that she had taken it when she was later told by police who were investigating Hallam for an unconnected attack on another woman.

The court was told Hallam had masterminded two savage hammer attacks on a fitness instructor his girlfriend suspected he was sleeping with.

Kelly Batchelor, then 31, was hit on the head with a lump hammer by thugs Hallam hired in two separate attacks in Poole, Dorset.

Hallam was arrested for ordering the attacks, carried out by three of his friends, andwas jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to cause GBH at Winchester Crown Court.

While police investigated Hallam for the attack, they discovered his plot to poison his unborn child.

He pleaded guilty to one count of administering poison or other noxious things to procure a miscarriage and was jailed for two years at Bournemouth Crown Court. Both sentences are to run consecutively.

Medication: It is not known whether the abortion drug - similar to that shown above - caused any damage to the unborn child or to Hallam's girlfriend's ability to have children

It is not known whether the tablets had any detrimental affect on his girlfriend’s unborn child or her ability to have children in the future.

Rebecca Austin, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court that Hallam began making inquiries into Mifemiso after his girlfriend told him she was pregnant last November. On November 9, Hallam began texting the drug supply firm in China.

Miss Austin said: 'Messages were found on Hallam’s phone which were sent to a number, the dialling code of which suggested was in China. He sent a message saying, "Please try. I’m desperate".'

Miss Austin continued: 'Hallam was arrested in relation to this offence where he made a comment to officers indicating that she had wanted him to give her "it", obviously a reference to the Mifemiso.'

After Hallam's allegation his girlfriend had wanted to take the drug, she was also arrested by police, but denied having any knowledge of it and was released without charge.

In court: Hallam was jailed for two years at Bournemouth Crown Court for administering poison or other noxious things to procure a miscarriage. The sentence will run consecutively with an eight year jail term for another crime

James Martin, defending, said: 'Mr Hallam had been taking a large amount of Valium and mixing it with alcohol, and it is right to say was not someone who was really in the right state of mind.'

In sentencing Hallam for the poison plot, Judge John Harrow imposed an order to keep the victim anonymous because of the horror and trauma she has suffered.

He told Hallam: 'You now admit administering drugs, intending to cause her to miscarry.

'I have to stress it cannot be established how many times you did this or whether it caused her to bleed.

'The effect of these events were clearly traumatic on (the victim) to say the least, not just what I am dealing with now but the fact that she was arrested twice.

'The case is serious, so much so that custody is inevitable because you put the life of anunborn child at risk.'
