A mystery customer shocked three waitresses at an American diner, tipping the trio $15,000 after overhearing their concerns about making ends meet.

The blonde-haired Good Samaritan was moved to help Amber Kariolich, 28, Amy Sabani, 25, and Sarah Seckinger, 23, after learning the trio were struggling to afford their school fees and bills.

The woman, who was dining at the Boone County Family Restaurant in Caledonia, Vermont, asked for the waitresses names before writing something down, wifr.com reported.

She then presented each of the women with the tip of a lifetime, handing them a cheque for $5,000 each.

Despite their attempts to decline the gesture, the woman, whose identity is being protected by the restaurant, told the waitresses: 'I want you girls to take these to help with school and everything else in life.

'Yes, you can take it. You put that in your pocket. God sent me here to help you,' reported the Rockford Register Star.

'It means a lot,' Miss Kariolich, who was serving the customer, told the site. 'Well, we all want to go back to school. Everybody has bills and what not so it means a lot.'

The tips came as an even bigger surprise to Miss Kariolich's colleagues, Miss Sabani and Miss Seckinger, who were standing nearby.

Dream: Sarah Seckinger, who has worked at the restaurant for six years has ambitions of becoming a police officer. She said she plans to use the money to return to school to pursue her dream

Tip of a lifetime: After overhearing the women's conversation the blonde customer asked the waitresses for their names before writing out the cheques. She told the women: 'I want you girls to take these to help with school and everything else in life'

The women were moved to tears, as they realised what the money would mean.

'I wasn't even waiting on her,' said Miss Seckinger, who dreams of becoming a police officer.

'I was just rolling silverware. We were talking about school and braces and loans and everything we can't afford and she just took it upon herself.'

While her colleagues are planning to use the money to pay for their school fees, Miss Sabani said she hopes to one day be in a position to offer a similar gesture to another person.

The mother-of-one, who has two jobs, said the money will enable her to spend more time with her son.

The restaurant's owner Matt Nebiu said he had never seen anything like it in 30 years of owning and running the diner.

He said although the woman had been to the restaurant before, she was not a regular.
