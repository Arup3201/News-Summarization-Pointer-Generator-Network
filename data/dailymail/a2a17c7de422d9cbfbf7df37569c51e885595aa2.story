Free performance: David Blaine did not charge the Department of Correction for the show on July 26

He is the world's most prominent illusionist, magician and escape artist.

So it's no wonder there were anxious faces when David Blaine teasingly showed dangerous criminals how to break out of prison during an intimate performance at the Manhattan Detention Complex.

The daredevil, who usually charges around $100 for tickets, performed some of his most famous tricks in front of a crowd of prisoners including rival Bloods and Crips members, according to the New York Post.

One inmate is said to have asked the 41-year-old illusionist to autograph copies of his court papers while another requested he use his powers to make the bars from his cell disappear.

Sworn enemies from the Bloods and Crips gangs are said to have temporarily put differences aside as they cheered loudly - with some even acting as assistants to the magician.

The hour-long show, organised by the Department of Correction, took place on the notorious sixth floor of the Manhattan Detention Complex, known as 'The Tombs'.

One source, who preferred not to be named, asked: 'How the hell does a killer get to watch a rabbit get pulled out of a hat?' 

One of the prison guards added: 'He was levitating and teasing inmates with tricks on how to break out of here. You know that isn't happening.

'I wish David Blaine would perform for us. I think we deserve it more than them. It costs hundreds of dollars to see him live.'

Sixty inmates attended the show on July 26, which Blaine performed for free, a Department of Correction spokesman confirmed.

They added: 'The Department of Correction uses positive reinforcement as one of many strategies to reduce inmate idleness and improve facility safety. 

'Inmates who attended this event were being rewarded for good behavior.'

The rowdy crowd of convicts who saw Blaine in action are said to have not included the 'worst of the worst' from the 9 South unit at The Tombs.
