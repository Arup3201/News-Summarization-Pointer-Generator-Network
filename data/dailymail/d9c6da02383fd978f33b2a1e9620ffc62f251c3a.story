Four pupils were stabbed to death by a middle-aged man as they walked to elementary school in south China today.

The shocking incident is the latest in a string of knife attacks targeting schoolchildren in China over the last decade.

Officials said police were searching for a 56-year-old suspect who slashed the children from a motorcycle, but gave no other details.

The incident took place at about 6:20am as the children made their way to the Gupu primary school in Lingshan County of the southern province of Guanxi.

The county government said on its website that three children were killed instantly with one dying later in hospital. 

China has seen many high-profile slashing attacks targeting schools over the past ten years prompting waves of tightened security but little in the way of lasting policy changes. 

Some cities including Beijing require ID and registration for the purchase of some kinds of knives.

Police are hunting for a 56-year-old suspect who they believe attacked the children from a motorbike

Earlier this month, a man killed three students in a knife attack at a school in Hubei province.

And in May 2010, an attacker hacked seven children and one teacher to death and wounded 20 other people in a rampage at a kindergarten in northwest China.

At the time, it was the fifth in a string of savage assaults at the country's schools in the space of just three months.

The knife attack was carried out on pupils from Gupu Primary School in Lingshan county, Guangxi Zhuang, China

Many of the attacks have been carried out by adults with no connection to the schools, with authorities saying the assailants suffered from mental illness or were lashing out at society because of some personal grievance.

Several communities have temporarily stepped up security in response to the latest murders, including the confiscation of knives at the gates of school compounds and in the surrounding community.

Many schoolchildren are also now receiving self-defence training.
