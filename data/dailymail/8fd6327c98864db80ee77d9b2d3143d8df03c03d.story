Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas once appeared in a tawdry television show where girls offered up sexual favours to win votes for a university election campaign, it has emerged.

The Prince's 24-year-old partner donned a midriff-baring cheerleader uniform in the 2009 drama Trinity, which aimed to be the UK's answer to hit show Gossip Girl, only to be axed after just one series when it failed to attract viewers. 

She also appeared as one of a group of female students escorted into a bedroom full of young men, who offer sexual favours in return for votes.

Cameo role: Aged just 20 at the time, aspiring dancer Cressida was on screen for just two minutes

The footage may prove embarrassing for 
Miss Bonas, who tends to avoid the public eye and is rarely photographed
 with her royal love interest.

Aged just 20 at the time, aspiring dancer Miss Bonas bagged the cameo role through her half-sister Isabella Calthorpe - who had a lead role in the tacky drama.

Miss Bonas appeared on screen for just two minutes in the fourth episode of the ITV2 programme, which was not recommissioned after its eight-part run.

As part of her short cameo role, blonde Miss Bonas joined a group of other young women, all dressed in the sexy Superman-style costumes, and performed a cheerleading routine.

She played one of a group of young women who entered a bedroom full of male students where one of the boys told a friend dancing alongside Miss Bonas to wash her intimate area as 'it's election week', according to newspaper The Sun.

Cut: Set in a fictional university college, Trinity, was filmed at Royal Holloway, University of London, but was axed when the 1.2million viewers who tuned into the first episode abandoned the show

Drama: In another scene, not pictured, Cressida was seen among a group of girls who offer sexual favours in order to win votes on the student council

Rumours have been flying that Prince Harry and Miss Bonas, who began dating in July 2012, are set to marry next year.

The couple were snapped together on a string of dates earlier this month when they attended a James Blunt concert and a performance of musical The Book Of Mormon.
