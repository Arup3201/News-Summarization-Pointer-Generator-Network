The man behind a hoax phone call, impersonating Aussie rapper 360 in an interview with 3AW has been confirmed as 'battle rapper' BK Ultra.

Talkback host Tom Elliott, whose integrity was questioned on social media over the incident, was led to believe he was talking to 360 on his radio show on Monday, but instead was being pranked.

360 filmed himself listening to the impersonator be interviewed and then posted the footage on his Facebook page.

It is the second time Elliott has been caught with egg on his face after a Kurdish man, living in Scandinavia, pretended to be ISIS commander Omar al-Shishani during a phone interview in August.

This is the second time Elliott has been caught with egg on his face after a Kurdish man, living in Scandinavia, pretended to be ISIS commander Omar al-Shishani during a phone interview in August

Speaking to music blog Project U, BK Ultra confirmed he was the prankster behind the call, who spoke for several minutes  before Elliott's team cottoned on. 

The Melbourne radio host thought he was talking to 360 about his controversial remarks on ABC TV show Q & A on October 20 where he said he identified the Australian flag with racism.

360, whose real name is Matt Colwell, took great delight in filming himself listening to the show where the impersonator told Elliott that he had joined the Illuminati – an historical secret society.

‘I was inducted because I am enlightened,’ the caller said when Elliott questioned that calling himself enlightened being was racist.

‘It has nothing to (do with) race it’s a mind frame,’ the fake 360 said.

The conversation then became even more bizarre when the prankster declared himself as a unicorn.

‘Who are you to say I’m not a unicorn?’ he said.

‘All I’m trying to do is open everyone’s minds up to these racist ideals and you are just trying to stomp them out.’

It wasn’t until the caller mentioned the previous prank that Elliott began to question his identity.

‘Last few weeks didn’t you interview an Isis fighter who turned out not to be an Isis fighter at all?’ he asked.

‘Yeah, we did and we acknowledged that, are you sure you’re Matt Colwell here?’ Elliot replied.

Although the impersonator never admitted to the hoax, he went on to ask about the show’s screening process.

‘How much research goes into who you actually interview? Or do they just ring up and say “Hi I’m 360” and I come on?’ he said.

After almost nine minutes, Elliott ended the interview and then conceded on Twitter that his guest was in fact an impersonator.

'Spoke to someone on-air and off-air who said that he was rapper 360. Turns out he wasn't. We shut the interview down immediately,' he posted.

The interview which was posted to social media went viral to delight of BK Ultra who posted on facebook, 'I think 360 and I almost broke the internet today.'

The 'battle rapper', who has actually majored in journalism, told Project U the reason for the prank was to make an example of Elliott, who was recently caught out pretending to interview a ISIS fighter.

'didn't pursue it as a career because of sensationalist nonsense like these so called 'reporters' are responsible for.' 

On Wednesday BK Ultra again took to social media to post more comments and a rap about his time on 3AW.

He said, 'penned a couple quick bars touching on the 360 / 3AW Drive with Tom Elliott stunt. If you like it, share it, if you hate it, tell me I'm a d******d, cheers #iPhonequalityswag.'

The prank also received several comments from the authentic 360, who took to Twitter, posting his support of BK Ultra.

'1 thing I hope everyone takes tonight is DONT believe eveything the media tells you,' one said.

This prompted many fellow Tweeters to ridicule Elliott for falling for the stunt a second time.

It was suggested Elliott was also about to interview Elvis, Jesus, 2PAC and Martin Luther King.

Some posted saying they had lost all credibility for the talk back host.

'It literally took me 30 seconds to find 3ree6ixty's manger's contact info. Do you even know what research is? Clown.' RocknRollJoe. said.
