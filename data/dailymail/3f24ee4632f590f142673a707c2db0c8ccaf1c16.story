It's a story that's sure to make you second-guess ever using second-hand furniture again.

A woman who picked up a couch off the street in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was shocked to discover the furniture was home to a boa constrictor two months after she had been using it every day.

Holly Wright told ABC13 on Tuesday that she and her boyfriend had given the couch a good once-over before bringing it home, never suspecting that a snake lived inside.

It had a 'for free' sign on it outside someone's house and was in pretty good condition.

Two months after she moved a second hand couch into her bedroom, Grand Rapids woman Holly Wright discovered a boa constrictor was living under the cushions.

Holly Wright, sitting on the second-hand couch that she discovered a boa constrictor in, has now put the lounge out front of her house with 'Don't Pick Up' scrawled across it in marker

'We smelled it and everything-- it looked OK,' she said.

'We peeled off the cushions, cleaned it up, never saw anything.'

But over the weekend the four-foot creature slithered out from the lounge.

'It's been living in the couch for like two months in my bedroom and I had no idea and it looks pretty big,' Wright said.

She added that the snake wasn’t too menacing, and instead appeared 'lethargic' and likely hadn’t eaten in a long time.

'It didn't really react or hiss, but when we poked it with a coat hanger it coiled up a little bit, so at that point we flipped the couch over,' she said.

Scary: Holly Wright could not believe there had been a snake inside her couch for so long

'It was quite cold in the room, there was no food for the snake and I think it came out of the couch because it was dying.'

Indeed, the spooky reptile died before Wright could take it to an animal rehabilitator.

She buried it under a tree and put the couch back on the street — with “Do Not Pick Up” scrawled across it.

The creepy discovery was still sinking in.

The couch was often used by Holly Wright - who said she read 'a few novels' on it - and her dog. Luckily the snake did not harm either of them

'Sometimes my dog would sit up there! I would drink a cup of coffee, check emails - I read a few novels on that couch,' she said.

'My room almost feels a little empty now. It's been really sad actually to realize all this time I was in proximity to that animal (that) was probably suffering.'
