Everton defender Leighton Baines admitted a clean sheet was almost as important as their first home Barclays Premier League win of the season after a catalogue of defensive errors left the players scratching their heads.

The England left-back provided assists for the first and last goals, scored by Phil Jagielka and Seamus Coleman, in the 3-0 win over Aston Villa as the Toffees recorded only their second shut-out in 11 matches across all competitions.

Injuries to key defensive personnel has not helped, but throwing away leads in particular has cost them at least four points, which would have put them within touching distance of the top four.

A second league win has lifted them into mid-table and Baines is looking for more defensive stability in the future as they look to put the errors behind them.

'We have conceded some strange goals this season and I am not sure, if you look at it, we have given up many more chances than we would usually, but for some reason we have been conceding,' he said.

'You go away and look at all the stats and analyse things and it is just fine margins in football.

'It was nice to get back to normal and keeping a clean sheet is something we will look to replicate in the next few games.'

Of just as much significance was the timing of Everton's goals as, after Jagielka's stooping 18th-minute header from a right-footed Baines cross, Romelu Lukaku grabbed his first for a month just three minutes after half-time.

That was enough to finish off a poor Villa performance and Coleman's close-range conversion of Baines' cross - this time with his preferred left foot - with 14 minutes to go ensured there were no late nerves.

Lukaku's goal was just the morale-booster he needed after struggling for form as a result struggling for fitness after the World Cup and Baines knows if they keep providing chances for the Belgium striker he will deliver.

'When you are bossing games you have to score goals, because the longer teams stay in it the more chance you have got of them nicking the goal and then they can sit in and defend,' he added.

'We got our goals at important times against Villa to finish the game off and we were in control.

'Rom was great for us last season and has a really impressive goalscoring record in his time over here so we know goals aren't a problem, we just have to keep giving him opportunities.

Visiting manager Paul Lambert said Ron Vlaar's return was a bonus but he will take time to be back to his best

'He is a goalscorer and he can score all different types of goals, left foot, right foot, in the air, and he puts fear into defenders and him scoring goals is good for us, because you need your strikers to score.

'I personally didn't feel any lag (after the World Cup), but Rom came back later than myself, Jags (Jagielka) and Ross (Barkley), so he started the season probably having only been with us a week.

'Bear in mind some of the other lads had been back training seven weeks, so in that respect it is only just starting to level out really and we hope we will get him scoring goals because he is vital for us.'

Villa's Belgium striker Christian Benteke is feeling his way back into football and his start at Goodison Park was his first since rupturing his Achilles tendon in March.

Christian Benteke returned to the Villa starting line-up for the first time since March but had little impact

Aside from one smart chance when he smashed home a rebound after his own shot came back off the crossbar - having already been penalised for a foul on Antolin Alcaraz - the powerful front man was starved of chances.

However, manager Paul Lambert hopes he will be back on top form soon as Villa have now lost four successive league matches without scoring a goal, something they have not done since January 2001.

'It might take him half-a-dozen games as he's been out for five or six months, but he has got to get fit somewhere so it is good to get him back,' he said.

'Ron Vlaar (coming back from a six-week lay-off with a calf injury) is a bonus, but losing Nathan Baker (to an ankle injury) so early in the game is a blow.'
