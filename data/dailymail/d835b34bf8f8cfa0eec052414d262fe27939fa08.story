Fearless Charlie Parker looks far from rattled as he comes face-to-face with a 10kg snake.

While the youngster's legs may wobble under the weight of Pablo - a 2.5m boa constrictor - the enormous reptile holds no fears for him.

At just two-years-old, the pint-sized animal lover is already an expert snake wrangler and is laying claim to being Australia's youngest wildlife ranger.

Greg said: 'We're still shocked by his natural ability with the animals. It's quite remarkable to watch - he has absolutely no fear of them and he doesn't just handle them, he also has the knowledge.

'We've never purposely exposed him to the animals - he's just got this obsession with snakes and lizards. It must be genetic.'
