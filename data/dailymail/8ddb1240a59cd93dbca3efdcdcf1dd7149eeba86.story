A musical director was thrown out of a First World War memorial concert for impersonating Hitler and making jokes about gas chambers in front of a German choir, according to sources.

David Barclay, 41, allegedly joked about 'removing clothes and showering with' a group of German singers who took part in the Three Choirs Festival at Worcester Cathedral.

He was forced to apologise over his remarks and now faces a disciplinary hearing over his future.

He said: I'm very sorry for any offence I cause during the Three Choirs Festival.

'I completely understand why what happened was inappropriate.

'I have apologised to the festival organisers and to the Cathedral and would like to offer my heartfelt apologies to all those who were present.'

Barclay specialises in renditions of German music, particularly Bach and Schuman, and has been principal cantoris tenor lay clerk at Worcester Cathedral since 2008.

He allegedly made the offensive comments to members of the Chemnitz Opera during a rehearsal of 'A Foreign Field' by acclaimed German composer Torsten Rasch.

A row erupted over complaints the Chemnitz singers made about their English counterparts abilities to sing in German.

Mr Barclay, who speaks German well, allegedly made comments about the German singers behaving like the Nazis.

He then mocked them by pretending to be Hitler, according to inside sources.  

A spokesperson for the Three Choirs Festival said: 'We can confirm that a member of the Three Choirs Festival chorus was reported to have made offensive remarks during a rehearsal for one of our performances.

'On learning of the incident the Three Choirs Festival management team took immediate action and the person concerned was dismissed from the festival.

'He was also disciplined by the cathedral and has apologised for his inappropriate behaviour, which he deeply regrets.

'The Three Choirs Festival is proud of its collaborative international projects and long history of social action and condemns any form of racism.'

The musicians had been invited to the festival, held between July 26 and August 2, as part of the ongoing commemoration of the outbreak of the First World War.

A letter sent to the Worcester News said: 'David Barclay, who sings with the Cathedral Choir has been suspended for impersonating Hitler in front of our German visiting singers and talking of 'removing their clothes and showering them'.

'Witnessed by many of us, he was dismissed from the festival and faces a hearing regarding his future in the choir. 

'Many things in the past are swept under the carpet, the Cathedral are happy to deal with this behind closed doors but we feel this should be made public.'

Mr Barclay studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London, under the Scottish tenor William McAlpine.  

A member of the Pershore Town Choir, where Barclay also leads, said: 'It is a very unfortunate incident and I think David may have misjudged his audience on this occasion.

'He is a real character but he is prone to making flippant comments. He would never say anything with malice and he is incredibly talented at what he does.

'What I have been told who was there was that the German delegation of singers were becoming bolshy about the performances.

'A comment was made about English singers, something about their poor grasp of the German sections of the piece.

'David, who speaks German very well, said something to the effect of the German singers behaving like the Nazis.

'I am told he mocked them by pretending to be Hitler. He was making a point about them not to be too critical of the English singers but it got out of hand.'

The Very Reverend Peter Atkinson, Dean of Worcester, said: 'A member of the Three Choirs Festival chorus was dismissed from the festival after highly offensive remarks were reported.

'The person concerned has also been disciplined by the Cathedral.

'The Cathedral does not condone racism in any form, and deeply regrets the offence cause to those who witnessed it.'

Torsten Rasch’s ‘A Foreign Field’ was a joint collaboration performed at Worcester Cathedral on July 31. 

Sally Cavender, of Faber Music who represents Mr Rasch, said: 'It is sad that this has happened.

'Unfortunately some people have a belligerent view of the German people but these comments are more like the kind of thing someone might say in a pub rather than a choir.

'A Foreign Field, which is written by a German about the First World War, can be difficult and is sung in German, English and Latin.

'It was well rehearsed and was very well received.'

It was reported in an earlier version of the article that Mr Barclay was the current Director of Music at Pershore Abbey, but this is not the case as he left in 2008.
