Without a trace: Blesilda Gotingco, 56, went missing after getting off a bus close to her Auckland home on Saturday night

A body has been found in a New Zealand cemetery after police charged a 27-year-old man with the murder of woman who went missing at the weekend.  

Blesilda Gotingco, 56, went missing after getting off a bus close to her Auckland home on Saturday night.

Her mobile phone and shoes were found about 400 metres from the bus stop on the way to her home in Birkdale, north of the city.

Police found a body, believed to be that of Ms Gotingco, in a bush area of the Eskdale Cemetery on Monday night.

A 27-year-old man is expected to appear in the North Shore District Court on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday.

The Gotingco family have been advised of the arrest and are devastated, according to police.

A team of 30 police officers had been looking for Ms Gotingco after she was reported missing by her family.

Gotingco had planned to catch a bus from Auckland city after finishing work at 7pm at Tower Insurance.

She spoke to her adult son at 6.21pm but when her daughter arrived home from work about 3.15am on Sunday, she noticed her mother wasn’t home.

Neighbours said they heard a high-pitched scream followed by a car driving off near the place where her phone and shoes were found on Sunday morning.

Police were previously perplexed as to what happened to Ms Gotingco, revealing on Monday they had no clue as to how she simply disappeared.

'Our ideas are limitless but we hope she's alive out there and someone knows where she is,' police told reporters.
