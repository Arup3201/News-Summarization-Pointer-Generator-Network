Smiling for the camera and enjoying time with her family, Edna Slann was a lively and happy grandmother.

But a ten-week stay at one of Soondressen and Maleenee Cooppen’s nursing homes left the 89-year-old malnourished, badly bruised, scarred, and with an infection that will soon kill her.

The widow – who has been given just weeks to live – is emaciated at little more than 5st, bed-ridden, and heavily medicated with morphine to numb the pain.

Edna Slann is one of three residents left with unexplained injuries after moving into the care homes being investigated by police. The 89-year-old required stitches to her head and suffered horrific bruising 

She is one of three patients whose unexplained injuries at Grantley Court Nursing Home in Sutton, south-west London, are now are under investigation by police.

Her family believe her rapid decline was caused by the poor care she received at the home and branded the Care Quality Commission’s handling of the case a ‘disgrace’. 

Her daughter Linda Cackett, 54, told the Daily Mail: ‘To think of her suffering and in pain for those weeks is horrendous. We feel so guilty. 

'Had she not gone to Grantley Court she would still be getting up today and taking part in activities. She could have gone on for years.’

Mrs Slann, who has dementia and was wheelchair bound due to arthritis, was moved from a residential home to Grantley Court in July when her health worsened. 

It is owned by Mauritian businessman Cooppen, 51, and his 42-year-old wife, who enjoyed lavish family parties in their homeland.

Shocking: The widow has contracted a deadly infection after a bedsore went untreated while she was living at the home. Right, she is healthy before entering its care

According to Mrs Slann’s family, she was neglected from the outset and her health deteriorated rapidly, causing her to lose more than half a stone in just two months.

Her daughter said Grantley Court staff did not keep records properly so she has had no explanation for how her mother came to need 12 stitches on her head and suffer severe facial bruising.

Outraged: Mrs Slann's daughter Linda Cackett says she would not have arranged for her mother to stay in Grantley Court had she been aware of concerns

And she says her mother now has not long left to live because of an infected bedsore on her foot that was not treated properly.

When she was eventually taken to hospital, doctors said the only way to stop the spread would be to amputate her leg below the knee – an operation she was unlikely to survive.

Mrs Cackett, a book keeper from Epsom in Surrey, said: ‘The home was run on a shoestring. 

'I’m surprised any residents survived.’ Mrs Slann was placed there in July by Surrey County Council, who allegedly told the family it was the only bed they could find.

The £595-a-week cost of her stay was met by Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). 

In September, NHS officials moved her to a different home where staff found the bedsore on her foot and sent her to hospital.

When they called Grantley Court staff to confront them, they were allegedly told it was ‘not that bad’.

Mrs Slann, a grandmother-of-one, worked as a cleaner until she was 70. 

A Surrey council spokesman said when Mrs Slann was placed in Grantley Court the home had passed its most recent inspection.

A Surrey Downs CCG spokesman said she had been relocated as soon as concerns were raised.
