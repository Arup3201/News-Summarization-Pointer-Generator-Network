Goodbye Mr Chimp: Louis as his alter ego Brooke Bond, which became a household name in the 1980s

He was never a household name, yet he was the very definition of a household face. Louis the chimp, who has died at the grand old age of 37, was famous up and down the land as Brooke Bond, the secret agent just as debonair as Sean Connery’s 007 — with even more chest hair — in the Eighties adverts for PG Tips.

It may be stretching a point to suggest Brooke Bond became as iconic as his human alter ego, James, but then again, it may not.

With his catchphrase ‘The name’s Bond. Brooke Bond’, he was voiced by the suave actor Michael Jayston, and became an instant hit when he first appeared in 1981.

Little wonder that six years ago, the PG Tips chimp adverts, which ran from 1956 to 2001, were voted the most memorable in TV history, narrowly ahead of the aliens advertising Cadbury’s Smash instant mashed potato, who laughed so rudely at earth people peeling potatoes with our metal knives, boiling them for 20 of our minutes, and then smashing them all to bits.

Moreover, we didn’t have to get used to a series of different faces playing Brooke Bond, as with 007. It was always Louis. And yet the fame never went to his head.

‘He was quiet and calm, which is quite unusual for male chimps,’ said Dr Charlotte Macdonald, curator at Twycross Zoo in Warwickshire, where Louis died on Monday following a short illness. ‘He was sociable and popular with the keepers.’

Golden age: Louis became famous as the debonair Brooke Bond - the secret agent even hairier than Sean Connery

His 43-year-old partner, Choppers, is bearing up well, Dr Macdonald added. ‘They were together a very long time, and chimps can pine just like humans, but she’s eating well, which is good.’

Choppers was not, of course, offered that time-honoured British palliative to ease the shock of a long-term companion’s death — a cup of sweetened tea.

But like Louis, she also appeared in the PG Tips commercials, and therefore played a part in one of TV’s longest-lasting and most effective campaigns.

Perhaps the most affectionately remembered of all was the one in the Seventies (not featuring Louis) in which two chimps cast as father and son removal men accidentally dropped a piano down a flight of stairs. The pay-off — using dubbed human voices — entered the annals of popular culture . . .

‘Dad, do you know the piano’s on my foot?’

‘You hum it, son, I’ll play it.’

Instant hit: Brooke Bond's catchphrase became almost as famous as his human alter ego

Such was the impact of those adverts that another of them is said to have undermined the popularity of the tandem bike.

Also dating from the early Seventies, it parodied the Tour de France in the days when the British were nowhere near as strong in the venerable race as they are now, and thus considered it ripe for mickey-taking.

A chimp playing a sexy Frenchwoman made eyes at another, playing a stricken cyclist, who asked, in a Yorkshire accent: ‘Can you ride tandem?’

'Sociable animal': Louis, pictured aged five playing with a Rubik's cube, was popular with his keepers

That gave rise to a catchphrase which 
remained the bane of cyclists’ lives for some years on British highways 
and byways. The tandem, which had once been considered rather a dashing 
machine, practically overnight became a joke.

It was another marker of a clever and enduringly powerful campaign, which was inspired by the chimps’ tea parties held at London Zoo in the Fifties.

TV advertising was born on ITV at precisely 8.12pm on September 22, 1955, during a variety show hosted by bandleader and DJ Jack Jackson. Viewers saw a tube of Gibbs SR toothpaste embedded in a block of ice.

Within months, the PG Tips chimps were added to the burgeoning mix of commercials to promote a brand of tea which Brooke Bond (the company, not the chimp) had launched in Britain in 1930.

Two years after the adverts were launched, PG Tips had moved up from fourth place to be the top-selling tea in the UK.

The idea of ‘talking’ animals was an instant hit — as were their  costumes — and while it is the norm now, at the time it was a delightful innovation.

It helped, too, that the chimps were voiced over the years by luminaries such as Peter Sellers, Cilla Black and Bob Monkhouse. But the real stars, of course, were the animals themselves.

In 1977, Mail photographer Mike Hollist photographed a preview of the latest commercial at Twycross.

‘Molly Badham, the director and founder, had turned Twycross into a world-leading centre for primates,’ he recalled. ‘These chimpanzees were absolutely amazing. Molly directed the event. She talked to them, gave them things to hold and things to do. They were terrific show-offs really, and there was a bit of misbehaviour, but not more than you’d expect from a group of children.

‘In fact, working with them that day, I found that after a while I forgot they were chimpanzees and looked at them as if they were children. You can find as much emotion on a chimp’s face as you can on any six-year-old child’s.’

Monkey business: The PG Tips ads were part of a clever and enduringly powerful campaign

But just as the chimps’ tea  parties once held at London Zoo fell prey to growing sensibilities about the perceived exploitation of animals, so too did the PG Tips commercials. In 2001, following complaints by animal rights activists, the axe fell. The decision reflected the political correctness of the times, but it was still widely lamented.

It is hard to imagine similar anxieties now if, for instance, those infernal Russian-accented meerkats were killed off. But then TV commercials do not burrow into our affections as they once did, possibly because we can now wield our remote-control units to wind forward through the breaks.

The irony is that there are infinitely more adverts on British TV now than there were in the heyday of the PG Tips campaign — when advertising was offered by only a single channel — yet they are infinitely less influential.

My children know perhaps three or four catchphrases or jingles from TV commercials, yet at their age I knew at least 50. And I remember them just as keenly now.

Most people over the age of 45 are still aware that Double Diamond works wonders, that nothing beats the great smell of Brut, and that Mackeson looks good, tastes good and by golly it does you good.

Success: Adverts like this one for Hamlets cigars were hugely popular in the Seventies

Even those who celebrated the end of 
those PG Tips ads, feeling that they demeaned the chimps, would surely 
have to admit that they were brilliantly conceived and executed. And 
while there is much dynamism in the advertising industry still, most TV 
advertising now is either vacuously inane, or too complex and cynical 
for its own good. Where is the simple humour?

In the Seventies, TV advertising’s golden
age, humour sold enough Hamlet cigars and Cinzano Bianco to sink 
battleships. Significantly, those were the years when several men 
destined to join the ranks of Britain’s finest film directors were 
cutting their teeth on TV commercials.

The Cinzano adverts starring Joan Collins and Leonard Rossiter, which — like those for Hamlet — celebrated cack-handedness, were conceived by Alan Parker, who later brought us the movies Midnight Express and Mississippi Burning.

Music, too, was used more effectively than now. It used to be said the definition of an intellectual was someone who listened to Rossini’s William Tell Overture without thinking of the Lone Ranger, and something similar might also be said of Tchaikovsky’s Dance Of The Reed Flutes, from The Nutcracker, which to the over-45s is far better known as ‘Everyone’s A Fruit and Nut Case’ from the Cadbury’s advert.

Witty: Adverts like this one for Cinzano used simple humour to sell products

As for Dvorak’s New World Symphony, for millions of us that evokes only one thing: a young lad pushing a bike loaded with loaves of Hovis up a steep cobbled street. That seminal 1973 advert, incidentally, was directed by a certain Ridley Scott, who went on to create Gladiator.

We don’t yet know whether any of this generation of commercial directors will end up being knighted for services to the British film industry, like Sir Alan Parker and Sir Ridley Scott. Perhaps some will. But they are plying their trade in less creative times.

So, as we celebrate the memory of Louis the chimp and his simian mates, we should also celebrate not only one of the great advertising campaigns, but an entire era when TV commercials looked good, tasted good and by golly — if only by giving us so much collective pleasure — did us good.
