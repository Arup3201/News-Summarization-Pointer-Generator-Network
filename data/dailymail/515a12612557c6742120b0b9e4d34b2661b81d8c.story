The Stepford wife may be better known as a submissive and docile housewife - but not Agent Provocateur's offering.

The lingerie giant has called on renowned celebrity photographer Miles Aldridge to work his magic and distort the world synonymous with the suburban housewife of the 1950s by giving her the ultimate sexy makeover.

The SS14 campaign aims to provide the perfect backdrop for the schizophrenic nature of the collection, says the brand.

Not so docile anymore! While the typical Stepford Wife is better known for being submissive, Agent Provocateur has given her a sexy makeover

The lingerie comes in colour-popping saturated hues complete with peekaboo lace, girly gingham, intricate embroidery and slinky knee high splits.

Speaking about the inspiration behind the campaign, creative director Sarah Shotton said: 'The campaign embodies my inspiration for SS14, the pristine and glossy 1950s housewife.

'I was interested in the irony behind the idea of the "perfect" woman, unfazed by the everyday pressures of life.

'Our campaign girl has it all, she’s a lady in the street and a wildcat in the bedroom and the collection mirrors her pretty perfection. It is a fantasy of silk and lace in the modern day world.'

Miles Aldridge added: 'Shooting with Agent Provocateur was like a childhood dream come true where I drop by unannounced on a school friend to find his mother home Hoovering the kitchen in just her lingerie.

'These sensations from early adolescence run through all my work like the pink sugar writing inside a piece of well-sucked Brighton rock, except the endless word in my rock is woman, woman, woman, woman, woman.'

The luxury lingerie label, known for 
its sexy underwear, saw its profit grow 55 per cent to £6.2m in the past 
financial year proving that big pants are officially out.

The label, which has been
 fronted by the likes of Spanish sisters Penelope and Monica Cruz, 
expanded hugely in the past two years, opening 12 stores across the 
world.

Stores opened their 
doors in Milan, Hong Kong, Sydney and Montreal and Agent Provocateur 
plans to open up in Chengdu, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Toronto and 
Calgary over next few months, The Telegraph reports.

The annual report announced: 'The 
directors continue to deliver a strategic growth plan for the expansion 
of the business both in the UK and internationally, with opportunities, 
to increase significantly the number of stores worldwide.

'While
 the global economic outlook still remains unsettled, particularly in 
Europe, the directors are satisfied that the business is in a very 
robust position to move forward.'

Agent
 Provocateur was founded in 1994 by Joseph Corré, fashion designer 
Vivienne Westwood's son, and his now ex-wife Serena Rees.

The
 debut store opened in Soho and has snapped up the likes of Melissa 
George from Home & Away, Kylie Minogue and Kate Moss to star in its 
campaigns.
