A Marks & Spencer worker went to drive home after finishing her shift only to find the entire front end of her car had been stolen.

Anne Eveleigh, 58, from Dinas Powys, Cardiff, was stunned to discover the bumper, bonnet and headlights had been taken from her silver Ford Fiesta in broad daylight on Friday.

The vehicle, which she had left in the staff car park of the store in Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff, will need around £2,000 worth of repairs to get it back on the road.

It is thought the audacious criminals struck at some point in the afternoon, as the car was still in tact when the worker went on her lunch break. However, as the car park was not covered by CCTV, it will be hard to determine an exact time.

Mrs Eveleigh's mechanic husband Stephen, 
61, said: 'She was quite upset - the Fiesta was stripped of the front 
end while in the staff car park.

'We asked Marks & Spencer to check their CCTV but the staff car park is not covered by the cameras.

'Someone must have seen whoever did this walking off with a bonnet, bumper and headlights.'

''I'm a mechanic myself so when my wife phoned and said the bonnet had been stolen. I told her just to drive it home and I would fix it.

'But then she said she couldn't as the lights had gone too, and the bumper, so it's completely undrivable.'

He told Wales Online: 'I drove down there, and I asked the store manager to get the CCTV while we were waiting for the police, in the hope that they might be able to trace them, but we were gob-smacked when he said there was none.

'She was parked in the area designated for staff, so I think they should be held responsible. That’s where they’ve been told to park and they have an obligation to look after their staff.

'I can’t believe that no-one saw anything - it’s a busy car park and it was in broad daylight. For someone who knows what they’re doing, it’s a 20 to 25 minute job, so someone must have noticed them.

'I’ve priced the parts and for those alone it’s going to cost £1,000 plus VAT, so it’s going to cost us well over £2,000.'

South Wales police confirmed they are investigating the theft.

Marks & Spencer declined to comment on the incident or Mr Eveleigh’s claims.
