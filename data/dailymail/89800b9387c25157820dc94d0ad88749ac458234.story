The vintage Chevrolet Corvettes destroyed earlier this year in a sinkhole may never be restored, the museum that owns them has announced.

Workers have only recently pulled the last of eight cars from the sinkhole which opened up February 12 at the National Corvette Museum, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and swallowed them whole.

Crews have not even begun any repair work on the recovered sports cars, a museum official told CNN, and may never repair as many as half of them.

Decimated: This 2001 custom-made Z06 was turned into a 'pancake' by the sinkhole

Before: The super car was able to hit 175 mph prior to be swallowed by the sinkhole

Before: A 1991 ZR-1 Spider owned by GM - no more than 12 were ever built

Unrecognizable: One would have to have previously known this car is a Corvette to correctly identify it

‘The last three or four cars that came out of the sinkhole ... we didn't expect them to come out looking quite that bad,’ Dana Forrester, lead Corvette restoration member of the museum's board of directors, told the network.

The last car was pulled from the pit on April 9, according to Forrester.

Among the wrecked automobiles is a custom-made Vette that was able to hit 175 mph before it was reduced to ‘just a tire.’

Museum officials will meet with veteran car restoration experts and a crew from General Motors to decide what can be done.

‘We'll listen to what they say about it, and then we'll make a decision as to which car gets restored and to what degree,’ he said.

Both the museum and GM, Chevrolet’s parent company, vowed back in February to work to restore the cars to their former glory, but there appears to have been a change of heart.

‘Recent discussions have changed what the original thoughts were,’ Forrester explained, adding that it ‘may not be possible’ to make some of the cars whole again.

Those that are restored may not even have all original parts like they did before the tragedy, Forrester further explained.

‘I don't believe they'll go that far.’

Ones that do receive the full treatment, including a tuxedo black 1962 model, might need to be restored by an independent expert.

‘It may be best that there's some other restorer to do it,’ said Forrester. ‘I know GM's got the expertise to go back and take the [two] cars they still own and work on them to a certain degree, but as far as structural work ... I don't know.’

The museum is currently displaying the wrecked cars, which one expert referred to as ‘pancakes’ in comments to CNN, while deciding how to proceed fixing them and the hole.

It appears to be working.

Attendance has risen 50 per cent since the sinkhole formed, according to Forrester. 

So have donations - to the tune of $75,000.

Among them are two rare models - a custom one-of-a-kind 2001 Z06 and a 1991 ZR-1 Spider of which only a dozen were ever manufactured
