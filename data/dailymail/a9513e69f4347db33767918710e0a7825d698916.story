A border state in northern Mexico is trying something it hopes will be more effective than photos on milk cartons to help find missing women and children.

It's using advertisements on tortilla wrappers.

At least three dozen tortilla shops have joined in the Chihuahua state campaign to print appeals for help on the thin paper wrappers that shopkeepers use to wrap up a pound or two of hot tortillas at a time.

Helping out: Esperanza Lozoya wraps tortillas packaged with ads asking for assistance in finding missing women and children, at the Hermanos Escobar Tortilla shop in Ciudad Juarez

The campaign, dubbed 'Disappearances in Juarez Must Disappear,' has been welcomed by shopkeepers and customers in the violence-wracked border city of Ciudad Juarez.

The El Paso Times reported that a major part of the campaign is Alma Alerts, similar to the U.S. Amber Alerts.

Tens of thousands of fliers and posters splashed with the faces of missing persons will also be popping up around the volatile city.

The paper reported that Mexican officials will additionally make appearances at area schools to keep students in the know about proper safety when traveling to and from the classroom.

Ciudad Juarez was hit by a series of eerily similar killings of more than 100 mainly young women beginning in 1993.Â 

While those killings have tapered off, killings and disappearances continue.

The wrappers have been distributed to 36 tortilla factories in the region, according to the El Paso Times.
