One pregnant woman in labor from Illinois knew she wasn't going to be able to make it in the hospital in time so she delivered the baby all by herself as her husband drove them to the nearest hospital.

Beth Farina was on her way with her husband Trevor to Sherman Hospital on Tuesday when she started going into labor.

She said she could feel the baby coming when they were at least a mile away from the emergency room.

Baby Tobias is in great health and Beth says she'll have a story to tell him once he gets older

'When we got on the Tollway, I knew we were not going to make it to the hospital. I was like, "This baby is coming, you better drive faster,"' Beth Farina told NBC.

Beth, who is studying to be a nurse, was able to successfully deliver her third child Tobias when she was in a moving car on the way the hospital.

'She told me she feels like we need to push, and I said, 'The best I can do right now is pull over and call 911,' and she told me to keep going,' Trevor Farina told reporters.

Farina says that during labor she was on the phone with 911 who gave her instructions following the birth of her baby boy.

'I waited for the next contraction, pushed him out, pulled him up onto my chest,' said Beth.

Beth's husband said he couldn't do much else but drive his wife to the hospital as she delivered her own child

Beth's given birth twice before and credits the successful delivery of her son with the experience she's gained as a mother

'My husband was on the phone with 911 and they said, "Do you have something to wrap him in?" We found something to wrap him in and wrapped him up,' said Beth.

Beth Farina started having contractions on Monday night but she and her family went down to the basement after Chicago announced tornado warnings.

Trevor fell asleep after the storm but his wife Beth was wide awake and about to give birth in less than ideal circumstances.

Farina was in labor for five hours and having given birth two times before she thought her third delivery would be smooth sailing.

As Beth was being driven to the hospital by her husband she knew she wasn't going to make it in time.

Since Farina is getting her certification to be a nurse and a midwife she was able to handle delivering even though she was a mile away from the hospital.

'It wasn't planned, but I'm glad it happened the way it did, because it will be a story for the rest of our lives,' she said.
