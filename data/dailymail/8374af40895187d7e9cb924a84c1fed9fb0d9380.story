Lutz Pfannenstiel is the ultimate journeyman. And so much more.

The globetrotting goalkeeper played more than 400 games for 25 clubs across six continents, turned down Bayern Munich and signed for the Crazy Gang.

He also spent 101 days in a brutal jail after being wrongly charged with match-fixing and was declared dead three times while playing in the non-League.

It all began in conventional enough fashion, with Pfannenstiel tipped for big things after representing Germany at Under 17 level.

But after declining the offer to sit behind Oliver Kahn in the Bayern pecking order, the youngster was grabbed by the wanderlust and left Bad Kotzing to head to Malaysia in 1993.

The next year the Premier League came calling. But the seasoned pros at Joe Kinnear's Wimbledon were never going to go easy on the teutonic new boy.

'Two or three days after I arrived we went for a run in a park and suddenly someone gave some command, they grabbed me and got me undressed so I was completely naked in November in the freezing cold,' he said. 

'They took all my clothes and my shoes and just left. I was lying in a ditch and wasn't sure what to do, then I had to run for three miles back with nothing on in front of loads of ladies walking their dogs. It's funny now but it wasn't funny at the time,' he told the BBC.

Pfannenstiel failed to make the first team and moved to Nottingham Forest a year later, where he once again did not make an appearance.

Pfannenstiel, who wrote a book called The Unstoppable Keeper, has enjoyed a remarkable career

It is his second stint on these shores for which he is best remembered. On Boxing Day in 2003 (while playing for his twelfth club, Bradford Park Avenue) Pfannenstiel was accidentally struck in the chest by the knee of Harrogate United striker Clayton Donaldson. 

His lungs collapsed, and after performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the club's physio Ray Killick declared Pfannenstiel dead before managing to revive him.

'It wasn't like a kaleidoscope - there was no colour, it was all black and white. There were black and white diamonds and it was very quiet,' said Pfannenstiel. 

'In the background there were figures but I couldn't make out who they were. I didn't feel cold, I felt all warm. I felt I was floating and it wasn't a scary feeling at all,' he told CNN.

When he woke in hospital he complained of being substituted, and was back playing within a week.

Now 41, Pfannenstiel reflects upon another dark period in his life; this time during his time in Singapore.

One minute he was a television personality and an Armani model, the next he was sentenced to 101 days in jail after being found guilty of match-fixing.

'In my case it was strange because I was actually accused of playing too well. Two games we won and one game was a draw where I was man of the match. If a judge in court tells you you've played better than you normally do it's not really logical.

'In the end I got out of it, the evidence was basically cleared as no money changed hands.

'I came out of that after 101 days and became a better person. It was the toughest time in my life but also the time when I learnt the most,' he explained to the BBC.

He told CNN: 'The prison had no bed, no toilet, no toilet paper, no toothbrush. I slept on the floor,' he said. 'People were on death row. People got hung.

'For breakfast, they don't say good morning, they punch you in the face. I had to survive in that circus. If it was for 101 days, it felt like 25 years.'

After becoming the only footballer to play professionally on all six continents, Pfannenstiel finally brought the curtain down on his career in 2011.

He wrote a book, The Unstoppable Keeper, which was longlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award, and continued in the game, scouting for Hoffenheim and commentated on the World Cup for German television.

And when he isn't doing that, he is consumed by his charity, Global United FC. He hopes to take some of his footballing friends,  including the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Jari Litmanen, John Barnes, Cafu and Lothar Matthaus to Antarctica to play a charity match to raise awareness of global warming.

'I want to leave the scene as if nothing had ever happened. We will clear the airfield using the snowmobiles, use yellow tape for the lines and we will build the nets. Within 10 minutes, the nets and lines are gone and nothing will be left. 

'We will have scientists advising us and if they say we can play elsewhere, fair enough but at the moment, the airfield is the most convenient,' he explained to CNN. 

And rather like his playing career, you get the impression that Pfannenstiel is already planning his next move.
