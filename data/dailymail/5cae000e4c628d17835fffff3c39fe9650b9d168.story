Disgraced former New York state governor Eliot Spitzer used to order his security guards to make themselves scarce so he could ‘sneak out’ for his infamous late night trysts with prostitutes.

Spitzer, in the running to become New York City controller, resigned in 2008 after admitting to patronizing a prostitution ring.

Now a new report has revealed that during his time as attorney general and 
state governor, the Democrat was known for evading his security 
detail during overnight trips, and asked officers assigned to protect 
him not to linger outside his hotel rooms.

Campaign trail: Eliot Spitzer is currently campaigning to become New York City controller, but his mistakes as state governor continue to haunt him

‘Please inform whoever the [overnight shift] is that they should not be hanging around in the governor’s hallway,’ former State Police Capt. Lisa Galbraith wrote in one message to Spitzer’s tax-payer funded minders, reveals the Times Union.

The directive was part of materials gathered by then-Attorney General Andrew Cuomo during a 2008 State Police investigation and recently made 
available under a Freedom of Information Law request.

The files show that Cuomo’s 
investigation not only examined whether the State Police had engaged in 
political espionage, but also how a sitting governor was able to have so many 
undetected encounters with prostitutes, while supposedly under their guard.

In one interview, Galbraith told investigators that Spitzer was also known for trying to 'sneak out' at night to evade the ESD (Executive Service Detail) members.

Loughran, who retired last year, also told investigators about an undated incident when Spitzer, as governor, was followed to a Manhattan hotel by a trooper assigned to protect him.

In February 2008, Galbraith said, she was notified by a trooper that Spitzer had left his Washington, DC, hotel room. That same week, according to federal authorities, Spitzer paid $4,300 to a prostitute who came to his hotel in Washington.

Spitzer has disputed the report.

'Eliot says that he never told anyone at the State Police how to do their job,' spokeswoman Lisa Linden told the New York Post.

Spitzer has also admitted in a new campaign ad released on Monday that he failed as governor due to his infidelities.

‘Look, I failed. Big time. I hurt a lot of people,’ said Spitzer in the commercial.

‘When you dig yourself a hole, you can either lie in it the rest of your life, or do something positive. That’s why I’m running.’

Spitzer also insinuated that negative attacks over his return to politics are being orchestrated by the large companies who he made his reputation battling against, rather than average people who might not be willing to forgive him for soliciting prostitutes.

'If you hear any negative noise out there, and you will, keep in mind where it’s coming from,' he said. 'Maybe being hated by the Wall Street firms isn’t such a terrible thing.'

A spokesperson for Scott Stringer, his rival for the controller position, told New York magazine: 'Eliot Spitzer's real failure was a governorship that left Albany more broken than when he arrived.

'It's clearer and clearer that for Eliot Spitzer, this campaign is not about the needs and struggles of New York's middle class – it's all about Eliot Spitzer.'
