An aid worker battling the deadly and fast-spreading Ebola virus in West Africa said the area is completely unprepared to deal with the crisis.

Ali Readhead, originally from Perth in Western Australia, has been living in Sierra Leone for the past two years and has seen first hand the devastation the disease is causing.

'It's chaos', she told Daily Mail Australia. 'They're totally under-resourced.'

'Patients are getting left in their houses because we just don't have any room.'

Perth woman Ali Readhead has been working in Sierra Leone for two years, and more recently has seen the devastating effect the Ebola outbreak is having on the region

In the capital city, Freetown, there are only 30 beds available to those with Ebola, despite there being thousands of people infected or suspected to have contracted the potentially fatal virus.

'They're just waiting for people to die to free up the beds,' Ms Readhead said. 

Ms Readhead originally moved to Freetown to work on the women and children's health policy, but when Ebola began to spread received a direct request from the Minister of Health in Sierra Leone to help fight the disease.

But she believed the only real way to contain the virus was if Australia and other nations sent expert military medical teams to set up field hospitals and isolation centres, two things which Freetown need so desperately. 

'The only way we have a chance of containing this outbreak is if we deploy military', Ms Readhead said before adding that they would be able to accommodate a level of risk humanitarian aid can't.

The aid worker has started a petition which has already garnered over 33,000 signatures, urging Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to do more than financially support the situation.

The disease is spreading fast without the appropriate resources to contain those infected

'I've never been more devastated in my life. Last week I returned to Perth after working with the health ministry in Sierra Leone – witnessing first hand how the deadly Ebola virus is spiralling out of control and killing hundreds.' 

'It's terrifying, and to be honest I'm not sure anyone knows when or how it'll end. What I saw will stay with me forever – in some places there aren't enough ambulances to pick up those infected or bury the dead,' Ms Readhead wrote on Change.org.

Just last week there was a direct request made by the government in Sierra Leone to Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

Ms Readhead said she believes there is hesitation in sending personnel overseas as there is a risk of infection. 

The reality is less than ten aid workers have contracted Ebola, and if isolation facilities were set up alongside US and the UK in West Africa treatment would be incredibly easy.

Ms Readhead also revealed the wider devastation the spread of Ebola was having on the community, economy, and already struggling healthcare system.

In Sierra Leone there are only 30 beds available for Ebola patients, so hundreds more are forced to stay at home until people die and free up space in the hospitals

People are terrified to visit hospitals, which is having devastating effects on the number of people accessing the health facilites, a problem the region has already been battling with for years.

'Pregnant ladies are giving birth at home, if your baby has malaria you don't take them to the hospital', Ms Readhead revealed.

'The hospitals are empty beside Ebola patients.'

She also told of how tough the struggle was to break down the stigma around accessing healthcare services, and how the disease is quickly unravelling all the hard work.

One in eight women died during childbirth before the government introduced free healthcare for pregnant women. 

This is worst outbreak of Ebola the region has ever seen, and the first time it has appeared in such an urban and highly populated area.

If it is not contained soon, the projection is grim. Authorities believe it could spread to more than 1.4 million people across the region if urgent and desperately needed help is not received.

The reason the virus is spreading so quickly is the close communities without standalone houses and the close proximity of marketplaces with many people packed into them allow it to spread with much greater ease.

'We don't have that level of contact in Australia... (and) we've got the medical expertise to be able to put in place the correct procedures', Ms Readhead said when asked if Ebola could post a threat to her home country.

Despite the devastating health implications, the aid worker insisted there is much more at stake than the terrible loss of life.

Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun

Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun.

Mining companies completing projects in West Africa have pulled workers out of the area in fear of Ebola, and others with 'investments in the pipelines are being disbanded.' 

The disease has already claimed hundreds of lives in countries in the area, and could claim many more if urgent action is not taken, Ms Readhead warned.

'It can definitely be contained... if we have beds for suspected or confirmed patients, healthworkers who are able to treat them.

'Unless we have those two things on the ground we don't stand a chance.'  

On Thursday evening the World Bank announced they would be providing a further $190 million AUD to go towards fighting the deadly virus outbreak.
