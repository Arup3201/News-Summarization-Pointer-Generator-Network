MP John Mann claimed that two whistleblowers who threatened to expose an alleged VIP paedophile ring may have been murdered

A campaigning MP sensationally claimed yesterday that two whistleblowers who threatened to expose an alleged VIP paedophile ring may have been murdered.

John Mann has passed detectives information about the suspicious deaths of the men who were allegedly poised to lift the lid on child sex abuse at the heart of the Establishment.

The development comes as the Labour MP told the Daily Mail yesterday that a key witness has come forward providing the address of a Dolphin Square flat which was used for ‘abuse parties’ by a network of high-profile figures including politicians and leading members of the judiciary, military and security services.

The potential breakthrough, which could help detectives identify the alleged perpetrators, comes a day after it emerged that Mr Mann had handed detectives a dossier naming 22 politicians – including six serving MPs and members of the House of Lords – suspected of involvement in a Westminster paedophile ring.

The Bassetlaw MP has since spoken to a victim who has provided a specific location where it is claimed that boys from care homes in Lambeth, South London, were taken to be abused – the apartment in the luxury block of 1,250 flats at Dolphin Square in Pimlico.

Mr Mann alerted police to allegations of child abuse at the prestigious block in 1989 when he was a Lambeth councillor, but nothing was done. The two whistleblowers he claims may have been killed are said to have been ready to expose powerful figures preying on teenage boys from children’s care homes in Lambeth.

The information Mr Mann has given police concerns the suspicious deaths of a Lambeth Council caretaker in 1989 and a social worker in 1993 who allegedly threatened to expose a paedophile ring linked to a future minister in Tony Blair’s government.

The unnamed caretaker was said to have tapes on ultra-violent ‘sex parties’ when he died in an apparent arson attack.

A second council employee, social services manager Bulic Forsythe, was found dead by firefighters in his blazing flat in Clapham. His skull had been fractured by a heavy weapon.

In the months before his murder the 42-year-old had told colleagues at Lambeth Council he was on the verge of exposing child sex abuse and corruption.

Witnesses have said Mr Forsythe had information about council buildings being used to film child sexual abuse. He died at the time of an internal council probe into alleged sexual abuse in the housing department where he had worked.

The Bassetlaw MP has since spoken to a victim who said children were abused in an apartment in the luxury block of 1,250 flats at Dolphin Square in Pimlico

The report is said to implicate council officers as well as police and politicians. It states: ‘The murder of Bulic Forsythe was seen by some witnesses as a possible outcome for anyone who strayed too far in their investigation or who asked too many questions.’

Though the panel found no ‘direct link’ between his death and work, it said its evidence should be handed to police. The murder was investigated but never solved and cold case detectives are re-examining it.

Police are said to be investigating five potential paedophile rings operating over the last three decades in locations including Dolphin Square, Lambeth, North Wales and Rochdale.

The Dolphin Square flat which Mr Mann claims he can identify is not thought to have been the residence of any politician. Mr Mann told the Mail: ‘It is a short-term let. It is a big apartment in a particular part of Dolphin Square. The allegation is teenage boys were taken there and abused by at least two MPs. It is a specific allegation which will need to be verified.’

The estate is a few hundred yards along the Thames from Parliament and apartments could be rented by the night. Police believe the block was the home of sordid ‘abuse parties’ between 1975 and 1984.
