Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper has announced that he is separating from his wife of ten years.

The governor and his wife, the writer Helen Thorpe, issued a joint statement today saying they remain close friends and would sometimes attend social events together.

Hickenlooper said that he will be moving into the governor's mansion but he will also continue to spend time at their family home in Denver with their ten-year-old son Teddy.

The couple said they sought marital counseling before making their decision.

They
didn't give a reason for the separation but said neither had an affair
and pointed out that the split had nothing to do with the tragic shooting in Aurora, Colorado last month.

A statement to the Denver Post read: 'After years of marriage that have added tremendous love and depth to both of our lives, we have decided to separate... You can continue to expect to see both of us out in the community â€“ sometimes together, sometimes solo. Please feel free to include both of us in social gatherings as we will not find it awkward.'

The
Hickenloopers were pictured together on July 25 at the memorial service 
for Gordon Cowden, the eldest victim of the movie theater shooting in 
Aurora in which 12 people died.

The governor, his estranged wife and their son will take their annual vacation together this week as planned.

The 60-year-old Democrat served as mayor of Denver from 2003 until 2011.

He joined the coalition Mayors Against Illegal Guns who support gun control initiatives to prevent violence and the illegal trafficking of weapons.

He became the 42nd Governor of Colorado in January 2011.

Ms Thorpe has written for The New Yorker, New York Times and Texas Monthly.
