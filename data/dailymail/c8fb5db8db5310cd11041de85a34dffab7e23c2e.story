Ever get the feeling that a company isn’t taking your complaint all that seriously? Well, one United Airlines passenger has had that spelled out for her in bold capital letters.

Reddit user ‘lyndy’ posted a photograph of an impersonal response from the airline on the social networking website to show just how insincere the company's customer service is.

The letter, which appears to be a template for replying to customer complaints, requires the sender to fill in the case fields with the customer’s details.

Except that the customer care manager, whose name had been blanked out, forgot to delete the dummy copy. Despite the fact that said fields were printed in bold capital letters.

Administrative error: The letter appears to be a template for replying to customer complaints, but the sender forgot to fill in the case fields 

The letter, dated July 17, thanks the complainant for writing to the company and apologises that the company’s service did not meet the customer’s expectations.

However, it then goes on to refer to the fact that the comments regarding the ‘(SPECIFIC EVENT)’ would be used in training and then states that the company has enclosed a ‘(SPECIFIC ITEM)’ as means of an apology.

The letter concludes by explaining that the airline considers it a privilege to have the complainant on board, despite the fact that it starts the sentence with ‘(CUSTOMER NAME)’.

Ironically, the letter is signed off: ‘Yours sincerely’.

The poster received plenty of feedback from other Reddit users, including one from Corn_Dog_Bazooka who wrote: ‘(SPECIFIC CURSE WORD) you, United Airlines.’

Meanwhile, fluteitup wrote: ‘Someone just got a bigger (SPECIFIC ITEM)’

A spokesman for the airline said it did not know whether the letter was genuine but said it would ‘reach out’ to the poster if they found out his or her identity.

United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart told U.S. website dailycaller.com: ‘I cannot confirm if it is authentic based on the picture, but it appears to be an unfinished customer response letter.

'If I knew who the customer was we would reach out to the customer and apologize for the response.’
