World Cup stars will have to go the extra mile for their countries in the heat of Brazil – the United States, however, have taken that all too literally.

For the Americans will travel a staggering 10,188 miles during their group campaign, the equivalent of flying from London to Rio and almost back again.

That is nearly 9,000 miles more than the distance which will be covered by Belgium, who hit lucky when they were drawn in Group H, meaning their longest journey will be a 35-minute flight to Belo Horizonte for the opening game with Algeria.

Air miles: World Cup teams will be forced to fly between matches given the vast size of host nation Brazil

Get used to it, boys: As USA arrive in Brazil, they face another 10,188 air miles during the group stages

Relaxed: US coach Jurgen Klinsmann chose not to relocate from Sao Paulo following the difficult draw

USA coach Jurgen Kilnsmann had the option to switch base camps when the group draw handed his side three northern matches, but the German opted to remain in Sao Paulo.

That will see them embark on a 3,596-mile round trip for their opener against Ghana in Natal, with journeys to and from Manaus (3.342 miles) and Recife (3,250 miles) to follow.

All in all, Klinsmann and his boys will spend 20 hours in the air and, amid the heat and humidity of what promises to be a trashing tournament, you can’t help but suspect such adventure is an unnecessary exertion.

Group rivals Germany have based themselves in Porto Seguro halfway up the Brazilian east coast, reducing their air miles to 4,560 as a result.

Rio-based England, meanwhile, will cover 4,424 miles during their first round of matches, and 3,548 of those will be journeyed this weekend before and after the curtain raiser against Italy in Manaus.

Long haul: Steven Gerrard (right) and co will travel 4,424 miles during the group stage

Plane sailing: Argentina and Lionel Messi have it relatively easy during the group stage

Of the big boys, Argentina perhaps have it the easiest – both on the pitch and in the air.

A group of Bosnia, Nigeria and Iran should present few problems – likewise a probable second-round tie against one of Switzerland, Ecuador or Honduras – and their Belo Horizonte base sees them travel just 2,240 miles between fixtures.

However, with staff at Rio's two airports threatening strike action on the eve of the tournament, the prospect of road miles as opposed to air miles would make for a different slant entirely on our distance table below...
