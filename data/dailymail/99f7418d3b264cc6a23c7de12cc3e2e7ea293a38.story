US Airways denies crew members used racial slurs against actor Brandon T. Jackson, who was kicked off a flight at a Phoenix layover because of unruly behavior.

Mr Jackson, best known for his role as Alpa Chino in 'Tropic Thunder,' had been drinking on the New York City to Phoenix flight Monday night and became upset when flight attendants stopped serving him alcohol.

He sent out 21 tweets about the experience and claimed a flight attendant 'called me the N-word.'

Phoenix police were called and the actor, who also plays Grover in the 'Percy Jackson' movies, was escorted out of the terminal at Sky Harbor International Airport.

Officers said they determined that no crime had been committed so they let Mr Jackson go. The 29-year-old actor then took another flight to Burbank, California.

'We've spoken with the crew members involved and they deny any use of the N-word or racist slurs with Mr Jackson,' said US Airways spokesman Andrew Christie.

Mr Christie added that the actor 'was disruptive and our crew made the right decision to stop serving him alcohol.'

He said the behavior started with Mr Jackson playing loud music in his seat. He was asked several times to turn down the music.

'Additional erratic behavior was observed and that is when the crew made the decision to stop serving,' Mr Christie said. 'If the crew determines to no longer serve alcohol to a customer, then their decision is definitive at that point.'

But the passenger sitting next to Mr Jackson, Darrell Howard, told TMZ on Thursday that the actor was not drunk and had no more than two drinks during the five-and-a-half hour flight from NYC to Phoenix.Â 

Mr Howard said Mr Jackson was nothing but nice and even shared a few scripts with him and another passenger, which supports the actor's claim that he told the angry flight attendant he was just 'rehearsing lines' with the people next to him.

TMZ reported Tuesday morning that Mr Jackson and a flight attendant named Dee began arguing on the flight after the crew refused to continue serving him alcohol.

Tiring of his act after telling him to sit down, the flight attendant reportedly said: 'I don't care if you're Obama's son -- get in your seat!!'

Mr Jackson said the flight attendant then called him the n-word.

He was soon released without charge and tweeted: 'This was the most racist thing that ever happen to me even the white people on the plane was like that racist.'
