A Manhattan judge approved a millionaire investor's request for a restraining order against his 'volatile and unpredictable' younger girlfriend in Family Court on Friday.

The motion to grant former hedge fund manager Brad Zipper, 50, a two-year protective order against 29-year-old former flame Nicole Raef was the finale to a legal ordeal with several dark twists.

Though saying both parties had a problem with 'credibility,' Justice Mary Bednar eventually sided with Zipper, who claimed in court his girlfriend was prone to violent fits and once threatened him with a kitchen knife.

'Sad day': A Manhattan judge approved private investor Brad Zipper's investor's request for a two-year extension of a restraining order against girlfriend Nicole Raef

The New York Post reports that Zipper's fashion consultant girlfriend allegedly picked up a 5-inch blade in the $6million townhouse where they lived during an argument last September 4.

She reportedly changed her mind and grabbed a 10-inch knife after judging the first to be too small, according to Zipper's testimony. 

'She was screeching at the top of her lungs. She had a blade of significant size, and I was scared,' he said. 'She was coming at me, then I was scared she was going to kill herself.'

The investor even brought the two knives to court last week, and was allowed to enter them into evidence after Raef admitted she waved the knives as a joke. 

The couple's tumultuous relationship became public back in November, when Raef told the Post she'd found herself homeless after being served with a protection order at Zipper's Hamptons estate.

'I was 100 percent shocked,' she told the paper, saying she'd had to pawn a pair of diamond earrings to afford legal counsel. 'We’d been arguing, but we’d worked things out.'

Zipper  told the court then that the restraining order was the only way he could end an abusive relationship that he'd 'attempted to break up several times and somehow was convinced not to.'

'I laid in the same bed with her' on September 5, Zipper said after being asked by Raef's attorney, Brett Kimmel, and though he could not recall if they had sex then, Raef claims they did.

In documents filed for the original restraining order, Zipper described coming home to find his oven on fire and Raef passed out in the guest room one night in 2012.

'When she woke up, she was delirious and didn’t even remember driving and getting into an accident with my car that night,' the documents stated.

He also claimed Raef threw wine bottles at his head during a party over the summer, and tossed thousands of dollars worth of his possessions into the pool at his summer home.

The relationship with the former head of Zinc Capital Management came with luxurious perks, such as ski trips to Aspen and beach getaways in St Barts, along with access to a $1.7million home in Southampton.

But Raef also alleged he'd been pushing prescription pills on her, saying she felt pressured to take the anxiety and depression medication Ativan by Zipper.

'There’s times when he’s made me feel worthless or completely desperate, and I did take it, as he encouraged me to and stood there with his hand out,' she said in court.

The trial also brought an admission from Zipper that he had taken illegal drugs at least 20 times over 4 years with Raef, according to the Post. 

In court on Friday, Zipper's lawyer, Marcy Katz, made mention of prescription pills, when talking about an email exchange where Raef apologized for breaking a door and said she took a Xanax afterwards.

Granting the two-year extension for the protective order, Judge Bednar said she found issues regarding the 'credibility' of both parties, but took the threat at knifepoint seriously.

'Certainly a nine-inch chef’s knife being waved at someone . . . with a threat to commit suicide . . . gives someone cause for concern for their own physical safety,' Bednar said. 

She found that Raef committed harassment, menacing and criminal mischief and urged her to seek mental health counseling and substance abuse treatment. 

'She believes she is the victim here and I believe that this is what the evidence established,' said Kimmel after the decision was handed down.

'All Nicole could do was try to defend herself,' Kimmel said about the claims of abuse and harassment. 'The bar in these types of cases is set very, very low.'

Leaving the courtroom, Zipper's only comment was to say 'It’s just a sad day.'
