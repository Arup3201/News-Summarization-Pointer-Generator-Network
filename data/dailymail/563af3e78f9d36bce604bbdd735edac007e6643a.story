Roberto Martinez says the speed of Arouna Kone’s recovery from a long-term knee injury will determine whether he moves for another striker before the transfer window closes.

Everton’s manager shattered the club transfer record to land Romelu Lukaku for £28million earlier this month and he also has Kevin Mirallas, young forward Chris Long, as well as Kone, as striking options for the new season.

However, Kone – who has not scored for Everton since his £5m move from Wigan in June 2013 – hasn’t played since last October after sustaining knee ligament damage and though he is around four weeks from being fully fit to start again, a relapse would force Martinez to make adjustments.

While he is happy with the shape of his squad going into Saturday’s opening clash with Leicester City, Martinez recognises that if Kone were to suffer a relapse, it would change the dynamics, particularly with a Europa League campaign to juggle.

‘A lot will be down to how Kone adapts,’ said Martinez, who insists there is no truth in morning reports that he is looking to offload the Ivorian. ‘I want Arouna to be in a position so that we can make a good decision going forward to January.

‘I don’t want to be bringing players just for the sake of it. It is difficult to say when he will be fully fit and, when he is, we will be really strong in that position. The squad is well balanced. I’m very happy with the balance we have in the squad.

‘I would say now that we are desperate to see how the team reacts, but you always have to try and use the window to your advantage. In terms of squad that we have I am delighted what we have achieved.

‘In terms of being desperate to bring someone in, the answer is no but we will use the period to see how strong the squad is and if we need to make alterations.’

Martinez unveiled his latest addition to the squad at Finch Farm on Thursday. Christian Atsu has arrived on a season-long loan from Chelsea and big things are expected from the Ghana international.

‘He is that player that you want to see him involved with the ball,’ said Martinez. ‘He is quite rare in what he is as a winger. We saw signs of what he could do at Porto, he has been successful at Vitesse and I know I see a young man with potential who is hungry to do well.

‘This is a really good opportunity for him. We want him to develop unforgettable memories. I expect a little bit of an adaptation period. I just feel that because he has been working at a Premier League club will make it smooth.’

Atsu, who spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem, added: ‘I’m very happy and proud to be an Everton player. It is a good move for me. They play good football. This is my first season in Premier League and this is a big opportunity.

‘The World Cup helped my confidence to play here. I want to help the team, enjoy myself and play good football. I believe at the end of the season we will all be happy.'
