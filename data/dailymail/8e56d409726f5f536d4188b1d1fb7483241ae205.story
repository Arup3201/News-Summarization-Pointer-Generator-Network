When Real Madrid arrive in Morocco on Sunday for the World Club Cup they will do so on a run of 20 straight victories and Cristiano Ronaldo will do so having reached a quarter century of league goals for the season so far.

Ronaldo had a frustrating 80 minutes but in the last 10 he scored twice to continue his incredible run.

Iker Casillas had to make a second half penalty save as Almeria pushed them all the way. The Real Madrid keeper said: 'Ronaldo delivered and we go to World Club Championship looking to cap off what has been a fabulous year. We hard to work very hard but we have come away with the points.'

Almeria sacked their manager in midweek after failing to win a single home game so far this season but they made a confident start with Sebastian Dubarbier seeing his shot blocked by Dani Carvajal on the edge of the area.

Ghanaian midfielder Thomas Partey then shot just over as the home side pushed forward but Real were slowly growing in confidence and almost scored when Toni Kroos had a shot by Fran Velez deflected on to the bar. Karim Benzema failed to finish from Ronaldo’s cross and the Frenchman then just failed to reach an over-hit Bale pass.

The Welshman was not finding his range but Isco showed him how on 34 minutes when he curled in the first of the game from just inside the area. Despite going behind Almeria did not fold and equalised five minutes later with a goal almost as good as Isco’s.

Raphael Varane headed a cross out of the area, Asier Illaramendi was slow to close down Verza who took full advantage to rifle a shot past Iker Casillas. Madrid are not used to going in front only to be pegged back but they responded with a goal three minutes later.

It was Toni Kroos’ seventh assist of the season right on to the head of Bale who scored his seventh league goal of the season to give Real Madrid the advantage at the break.

On 54 minutes, Real Madrid almost extended their advantage when Bale ran from the halfway line to the edge of the area but when he should have crossed to Ronaldo who had sprinted with him he tried to find the far corner himself with a shot and sent the ball wide. Ronaldo didn’t look happy that Bale had opted to shoot instead of pass. Ronaldo went for goal himself from distance with Real’s next chance but Ruben Martinez made the save.

The missed chance nearly cost Madrid when Edgar Mendez won a penalty after tripping over Marcelo’s challenge. The referee pointed to the spot but Casillas saved Verza’s penalty.

Real were still making hard work of sealing the win. Ronaldo ran onto the Illaramendi’s pass but shot straight at Ruben again. He then scuffed a volley to the delight of Almeria supporters and was booked shortly after for a foul on Xima Navarro but with his night getting worse by the minute, he scored twice to kill off the game.

Karim Benzema broke down the left and pulled the ball back to the Portuguese who scored. He then turned in Carvajal’s cross from the right to make it 25 league goals so far this season – every bit as incredible as 20 straight wins.
