A growing number of Mormons are pushing their church to relax its rules on homosexuality as families struggle to come to terms with teachings that conflict with their own situations.

Wendy and Tom Montgomery became part of the group calling for acceptance after discovering that their teenage son is gay.

'It made me question everything,' Mrs Montgomery, who had campaigned against gay marriage in California in 2008, said.Â

Campaign: Wendy Montgomery is calling for changes in the Mormon church after learning her son is gay

The 37-year-old mother is part of a group that is encouraging the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to teach homosexuality isn't a sin - and she is having some success.

The Utah-based church has softened its stance on homosexuality since leading a multi-million dollar campaign over California's Proposition 8.

A website started this year encourages more compassion toward gays, implores them to stay in the faith and clarifies that church leaders no longer 'necessarily advise' gays to marry people of the opposite sex in what used to be a widely practiced Mormon workaround for homosexuality.

In May, church leaders backed the Boy Scouts' policy allowing gays in the ranks. Some gay Mormons who left or were forced out of the church say they are now being welcomed back - even though they remain in same-sex relationships.

Nearly 400 members of the church have also taken part in Utah's gay pride march in Salt Lake City in the past two years.

It may seem like negligible progress to outsiders, but Mormon scholars say 2013 has been a landmark year for the religion on gay and lesbian issues.

'For those who have been around as long as I have, to have Mormons and gays in the same sentence is quite something,' Bob Rees, a visiting professor of Mormon Studies at the Graduate Theological Union and the University of California, Berkeley, said.

Fears: Jordan Montgomery was worried his parents would disown him because he is gay

The church has only gone so far though. At a conference this weekend, church apostle Dallin Oaks reiterated that human laws cannot 'make moral what God has declared immoral'.

The website, set live in December, reinforced that while same-sex attraction itself isn't a sin, succumbing to it is.

The contrasting messages have left many Mormons struggling to figure out where they stand.

Mrs Montgomery is among them. Her world changed after she read her son's journal last year and learned he was gay.

'I'm looking at this 13-year-old boy who is totally innocent and pure and an amazing kid and I think, "Either everything I know about homosexuality is wrong, or my son is not really gay. And, he's obviously gay".' she said. 'I kind of had to unlearn everything I had learned.'

The family, from Bakersfield in California, set out on a six-month spiritual journey as they reconciled their love for their son, Jordan, with the teachings of their faith.

They let family and friends in the church know he was gay and established that they wouldn't tolerate harsh treatment of their son.

They remain faithful Mormons, but have switched congregations after enduring ridicule from friends and fellow church members.

One woman told Mrs Montgomery her children should be taken away from her and given to somebody who follows the teachings of the prophet.

Mrs Montgomery and her husband had to step down from their church positions - he was the assistant bishop and she was a Sunday school teacher for teenagers - after parents flooded the bishop's office with complaints that they were teaching homosexual propaganda.

Their story is featured in a documentary made by the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University.

The Montgomerys found the organization after becoming frustrated with church therapists who told them Jordan was just going through a phase.

The organization works with conservative religious families to help them navigate their doctrines while accepting their gay children.

Caitlin Ryan, the project director, has written a pamphlet specifically designed for Mormons that has been distributed throughout Utah churches.

She said she believes the church is paying attention to research that shows suicide has been a major issue with LGBT Mormon youth for decades.

In the documentary, Jordan said he had suicidal thoughts and was worried about how his parents would react to his sexuality.

Acceptance: The church has become more tolerant, with members joining the gay pride parade for the past two years

'Our most important value in the church is family. I was mortified at the idea of being disowned by my parents,' he said.

Mrs Montgomery doesn't know how long her son will remain in the church, but steps taken in the past year have given her hope that church leaders will one day reverse their stance on homosexuality.

'There are so many that grew up in my situation, in conservative, religious homes that are being taught this,' she said. 'It's just not accurate. It's not right. And it's so damaging to the kids.'
