Air traffic controllers are left unable to explain a plane's strange contrail, which was photographed on Monday morning by a woman in Southsea, Hampshire.

The plane's trail resembles a ditch, bent in such a way that suggests that the plane suddenly changed its path mid-air before going back on itself.

Florence Lehmann, a local teacher, was the first to spot the plane's vapour trail when she left her home at about 7:20am on Monday.

Air traffic controllers cannot explain strange contrail

'It's really weird,' she said.

'It looks like the pilot sneezed or fell asleep.'

'Somebody said a UFO had been spotted recently in the area and the pilot had tried to avoid it, which I quite like the sound of.

'There was no wind this morning and the plane actually moved trajectory.'

The sighting she mentioned refers to a spotting in Portsmouth last week.

A grey-spherical object was photographed above the neighbouring town, causing speculation from some residents that it may have been a UFO.

Adding fuel to such speculation, the Met Office reportedly said that last week's sighting was not linked to the weather.

Planes often leave a visible vapour trail in the sky, but they normally follow a straight line

As far as this week's flight path detour, it too remains a mystery.

A spokeswoman for Nats, the air traffic control company, is unable to offer explanation as to why the plane had apparently changed direction.

'Unfortunately Nats has no knowledge of the purpose of any given flight and we do not identify individual aircraft to members of the public,' she said.
