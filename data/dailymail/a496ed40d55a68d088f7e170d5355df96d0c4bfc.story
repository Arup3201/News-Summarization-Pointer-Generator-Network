The life of former England footballer Paul Gascoigne is set to be turned into a hit movie, it has been reported today.

An Oscar-nominated production team is said to have been lined up to make a film about the ups and downs of the 47-year-old's life, including his playing days and his battle with drink.

Early indications suggest that producers are considering calling the movie 'Gazza - British Raging Bull' - and the former football star wants Sean Bean to play him.

A source close to the Gascoigne told the Daily Star that the film was already at 'planning stage'.

'An initial contract has been signed. We're working with a well-respected production company who have been nominated for an Oscar in the past.

'Paul has had an incredible life and we know they'll do it justice on screen. He's very excited.'

The newspaper reported that 55-year-old Sean Bean may be ruled out of playing the lead role on account of his age.

It suggested EastEnders star Danny Dyer, 37, and Skins actor Jack O'Connell, 24, were contenders for the part.

MailOnline has contacted Gascoigne's representatives for a comment this morning.

The former Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur player won 57 caps for England and made a series of memorable performances for his country during the World Cup in 1990 and the 1996 European Championships, earning him legendary status among many  supporters.

Last month, he spoke about his ongoing battle with booze in a TV interview.

The 47-year-old, who retired from the game in 2004, admitted  that he 'knew he was in trouble straight away' after his most recent relapse - which saw him placed on a three-day emergency detox in October.

Speaking in an interview on ITV's This Morning, Gascoigne looked healthy and relaxed as he told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes about his struggle.

He said that he wasn't in a 'massive state' during his most recent relapse, but admitted that it was enough 'to get himself into trouble'.

In an interview with The Sun he claimed that the episode was only a 'blip.

He said: 'I was doing well, but every day was like Groundhog Day - doing the same thing - and I started drinking again. I was going to the gym, going shopping then going home. I just had a little blip. I messed up. But when that happens to me the whole world sees it.'
