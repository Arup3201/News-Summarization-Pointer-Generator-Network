A man accused of murdering a gay 
supermarket worker embarked on a campaign against uncaught paedophiles 
using 'military strategy' to track them down after overhearing convicted
prisoners planning new offences while in prison, a court heard.

Christopher Hunnisett, who is on trial
accused of killing supermarket worker Peter Bick, told the court he 
used the internet and a network of 'live sources' - some made in prison -
to investigate rumours of child abuse.

He assigned possible offenders militaristic 'call signs' depending on the strength of evidence against them, he said.

The jury at Lewes Crown Court was told
Hunnisett, 28, started the operation after being acquitted and freed in
September 2010 following a retrial for the murder of the Rev Ronald 
Glazebrook, whom he accused of abusing him, for which he had already 
served nine years of a life sentence.

While on remand ahead of the second 
trial, the court heard today, he took part in 'therapy sessions' at 
Grendon Underwood prison in Buckinghamshire, designed as a form of 
restorative justice to try to treat sex offenders. But he overheard 
offenders planning a paedophile ring.

Hunnisett told the court today he 
investigated Bick, 57, after being told a 'rumour' about him, saying the
police lacked enough power to catch paedophiles.

Giving evidence, he told the court 
that after 'philosophy' discussions with other prisoners on how to deal 
with sex offenders, he decided he wanted to track down 'rapists, 
paedophiles, those who force women into prostitution, sex traffickers' 
by breaking the law and hacking into profiles on sex websites to see 
what users were doing - something he claimed the police cannot do.

'There are so many paedophiles in this country, over 600,000 who just offend against children,' he said.

'Even if I stopped more than 100 a day
I would take over 20 years to deal with them. It is impossible for one 
person to stop them all.

Claims: Hunnisett, left, alleged that he was abused by Rev Ronald Glazebrook, right. Hunnisett served eight years of a life sentence for the clergyman's killing, but was later acquitted of his murder

'I commend the police and the child 
protection agencies for what they are doing but they are beaten by 
certain rules and regulations.

'If you really want to find out ... 
you have to look at their (website) profiles and see who they are 
talking to. It is not hard to find these people but the police are 
beaten by the rules.'

While in the witness box Hunnisett 
used military terms like 'in the field' to describe how he investigated 
claims of sex offending, using call signs like 'Sierra' to describe a 
'suspect' and 'Tango' to describe a 'target' against whom he had proof 
of illegal activities.

One they had been 'dealt with' they were reclassified as 'x-ray'.

He admitted reading books about intelligence agencies to help him plan his activities.

He said he tracked down Bick after a 
contact gave him the name of a 'Peter' living in Bexhill, showed him a 
digital picture and told him a 'rumour' of what he was alleged to have 
done.

Hunnisett said he investigated and met several men called Peter before he found Mr Bick.

Mr Bick was killed during the early 
hours of January 11 last year after Hunnisett, whom he had met for sex, 
inflicted five severe blows to his head with a hammer and strangled him 
with a shoelace, the court has been told previously.

The jury has also heard that Hunnisett wrote to his girlfriend, Lucy Anderson, while on remand, admitting the killing.

It read: 'I know you do not understand
why I did what I did. In short, I simply wanted to stop some really 
nasty people hurting kids, the young, the weak, the vulnerable.

'I never planned to hurt him, I just wanted to stop him, get evidence on him to get him to confess and tell people what he was.'

Hunnisett went on to tell Miss Anderson that when Mr Bick confessed to him he lost control, the court heard.

He added: 'You have no idea how mad it makes me knowing that someone can do that and they think it's okay.

'It's disgusting and they have no idea how much it destroys a person and damages them, and no one gives a damn about it.'

The trial has already heard there is no evidence that Mr Bick was a paedophile.

Hunnisett, of Chanctonbury Drive, 
Hastings, East Sussex, denies murder but admits manslaughter by way of 
diminished responsibility.
