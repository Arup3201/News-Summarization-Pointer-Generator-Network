Attempts were made on Wednesday  to dismiss Mo Farah’s astonishing Twitter row with Great Britain’s second best distance runner as a juvenile exchange between two athletes who really should know better.

Others, however, saw it as the moment Farah allowed his mask to slip; when we were suddenly given a view of the double Olympic champion that those around him have long tried to conceal.

Andy Vernon does need to take some responsibility for provoking the runner he finished second to in last summer’s European Championship 10,000m final. He has a bit of form for being outspoken on social media and he questioned the quality of the field assembled for Farah’s attempt at the world indoor two mile record in Birmingham this weekend, suggesting it was not a proper race and branding it a ‘joke’.

But the response shocked even Vernon, who suddenly found himself being publicly branded an ‘embarrassment’ and someone Taylor Swift would beat. ‘ComeBackWhenYouWinSomething Decent,’ Farah added, which was probably the remark that offended the wider athletics community most.

On Wednesday Vernon summed up the feelings of all those athletes who strive to be successful in the absence of the incredible talent Farah possesses. 

‘If he thinks I am an embarrassment, then what does he think about the rest of us?’ said Vernon. ‘It came across very arrogant from him.’

Others were just as offended. One Olympian told me Farah had ‘crossed a line’. Another said Farah had been ‘hugely disrespectful to fellow athletes’. Vernon is a major championship medallist after all; a national cross-country champion too. Decent? ‘I feel it’s harsh on everyone else,’ added Vernon.

It’s certainly harsh on Vernon, when he trains every bit as hard as Farah but just lacks that bit of quality that separates the very best from the very good.

Over the past five years he has earned between £15,000 and £20,000 a year in pursuit of the two European medals he won in Zurich last summer. He has had to do other jobs to make ends meet and now has a stake in a refurbishment company. His earnings amount to a fraction of the money Farah commands. Farah will make more on Saturday than Vernon earns in a year.

Finding anyone brave enough to discuss a situation that embarrassed the sport proved difficult.

Farah’s representatives did not respond to messages while his sponsors at Nike said they did not comment on the ‘personal accounts’ of their athletes . They might pay Farah a fortune to inspire people to buy their running shoes but the moment he rubbished the efforts of all runners out there pounding the streets they essentially ran for cover. UK Athletics declined to comment too.

So credit to Dave Moorcroft, one time 5,000m world record holder and former UK Athletics chief executive, for giving his view and recognising that this needs to be addressed when it can be damaging, not just to a British sporting icon but to British sport.

These days Moorcroft is a central figure in trying to inspire people to participate in sport. He is the director of sport for the Olympic legacy project, Join In. He was dismayed by the row between two athletes he has known since they were competing as youngsters.

The response ‘ComeBackWhenYouWinSomething Decent’ from Farah offended many in athletics

‘For me it highlights the danger of Twitter and social media,’ said Moorcroft. ‘Neither of them should be disrespecting the other. They should concentrate on running.’

Moorcroft said he winced at Farah’s comments. ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘I’ve watched them grow up and I’m proud of how well they’ve done. Mo’s got nothing to prove. I wouldn’t care if my granny was against him. He’s still a joy to watch.’

As Vernon said, it is no secret that races are sometimes organised to give the paying punters what they want. In this case a Farah victory and the Mobot celebration they all like to mimic.

Saturday’s race is one Farah should win, given the field will be populated by a 40-year-old Bernard Lagat and runners only strong enough to either act as pacemakers or also-rans. But it will not be easy when his objective is to set his first world record.

Vernon might have overlooked that point but Farah also ignored the fact that his rival had only just returned to running after serious injury when he teased him for failing to secure a place in the race.

Curiously there does not appear to be any history of spats between them. Vernon has a picture of him with Farah after their European triumph on his Facebook and Twitter pages, and in Zurich last summer they would dine together.

But some observers have noted a change in Farah in recent years. If he was delighted to celebrate with team-mate Chris Thompson after a European one-two at 10,000m in 2010, there seemed a reluctance on Farah’s part to pose for photographs with Vernon in Zurich.

After such extraordinary levels of success since that breakthrough season five years ago, it certainly looked like Farah was no longer prepared to share the limelight. If true, it will not necessarily be because he is being badly advised. His representatives look after Usain Bolt and he is a media dream.

But some who know Farah would say he has not coped so well with life in the spotlight, responding with arrogance and aggression when he needs to recognise that with fame comes responsibility as well as the kind of attention he often seems to resent. He can be difficult to handle, sometimes even throwing the occasional tantrum.

It has been noted that it may not help that his wife, Tania, takes care of some of his PR when the emotional attachment she obviously has can cloud her judgment.

On Wednesday it was suggested she sometimes Tweets for her husband. In fact, journalists once asked Farah about something he had tweeted after a race. ‘Did I say that?’ he asked, completely oblivious to what was on his Twitter page.

On Friday, in Birmingham, he will be asked about the comments made this week. The important thing now is how he responds.
