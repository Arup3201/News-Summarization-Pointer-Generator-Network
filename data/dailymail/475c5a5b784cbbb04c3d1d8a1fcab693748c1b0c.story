She's the glamorous Monégasque princess turned model and now showjumper but it seems life isn't always so charmed for Charlotte Casiraghi.

Competing in the jump-off during the Prize Evian competition at the Paris Eiffel Jumping, the royal, 27, took a tumble, ending the event sprawled on the sand.

Despite the painful fall, the fifth-in-line to the throne of Monaco was soon back on her feet and was helped off the Champ de Mars course by officials.

Her horse, a dapple grey gelding named Tintero, was also none the worse for his stumble and was caught by grooms before being led off to the stables.

Casiraghi has pursued a professional showjumping career since 2009 but put her career on hold last year ahead of the birth of her baby son Raphaël last December.

Like Zara Phillips, the royal was soon back in the saddle and last month proved she was back to winning ways when she triumphed in the Longines Pro-Am Cup in Monte-Carlo.

Joined by Gucci team mate, Edwina Tops-Alexander, Casiraghi beamed as she was handed the trophy by her mother, Princess Caroline of Monaco, watched by her brother Andrea and his wife, Tatiana Santo Domingo.

Looking good: Casiraghi has recently returned to showjumping following the birth of her son Raphael last year

The win came just a week after Casiraghi and her fiancé, Gad Elmaleh, 43, held a lavish christening party for their baby son.

At the party, which took place at the royal palace of Monaco, the couple were joined by Princess Caroline and her daughter, Princess Alexandra of Hanover, as well as Charlotte's uncle Prince Albert of Monaco, 56, and his wife Princess Charlene, 36.

The royal couple can look forward to the baptism of their own baby later this year, after announcing Charlene's pregnancy last month.

Although early reports suggested that the South African former swimmer was expecting twins, the Prince's Palace of Monaco is yet to confirm whether one or two new additions to the Monégasque royal family will arrive in December.
