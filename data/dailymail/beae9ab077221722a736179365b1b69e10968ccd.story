The Royal Mail is refusing to make deliveries to 90 homes on a housing estate - because of one 'aggressive' dog.

Residents in Salford have been sent a letter warning them their post has been temporarily suspended for health and safety reasons after two postmen were confronted by the animal.

One of the men allegedly had to defend himself with his postbag - which was damaged in the attack. Neither of the postmen were bitten.

The letter was sent on February 7 to households in and around Briar Hill Avenue in Little Hulton.

It said a health and safety assessment showed the level of risk was 'unacceptably high due to threat of further dog attacks'.

It
apologised for the inconvenience - and told residents they would have 
to travel four miles to collect their mail from a delivery office.

The canine culprit is a dog named Jarvis who lives with owner Victoria Ludlow, 36, and her cat called Brian. She was not available for comment.

Today one neighbour of Miss Ludlow said: 'This all seems like an over-reaction.

'Jarvis is a great dog who is often let out onto the drive way and he runs through the broken down fence into the park next door but he never harms anyone - he just doesn't like postmen that's all.

'He is always plays with the kids on the park and they don't get scared by him despite him being a big dog and as far I'm aware no-one else gets threatened by him.

'He's a great dog - it's just that he seems to have an intense hatred of postmen.

'He does get aggressive when they come - I can only assume its to do with the uniforms or the fact they sometimes wear high-visibility jackets.

'Not so long ago there was a broken 
street light outside the house and a man fixing the telephone mast was 
wearing a hi-vis jacket. Jarvis came bounding out barking at the bottom 
of the light at the man and he was stuck up there for absolutely ages.

'I can understand that the postmen 
don't want to come near a dog if it's going to jump at them like but on 
the other hand why don't they just complain to police.

'If they have a problem with one 
house they shouldn't be stopping the post down the whole street - its 
ridiculous. Vicky has Jarvis, the dog, and a cat called Brian.

'We've lived here a year and only 
spoken to her maybe four times. She keeps herself to herself but we have
no trouble from her or the dog. If he barks at us we tell him to get 
down and he does every time.'

The Royal Mail said it was working with the dog's owner to find a solution. The mail boycott has divided the estate.

Tony
Lee, 33, said: 'I don't know the owner but I've never had any trouble 
from that dog. It's blatantly obvious to me that they only need to stop 
deliveries at the address where the dog is, not all these homes.'

The letter residents received. It says the risks of delivering to their area is 'unacceptably high' due to the dog (file picture)

Neighbour
Brian Lowe, 73, a great grandfather of three, added: 'It's absolute 
rubbish that we are all being punished for one dog.

'Now
I have to take a bus and walk for a very long way to collect my mail. 
It's hard to believe that one dog is affecting all our mail.'

But other residents said they too had been chased by the dog.

Paul Ogden, 24, of Briar Hill Avenue, said: 'If it's too unsafe for the postmen then what about us?

'We've got kids - surely something should be done about it. It has chased me before. It's a big dog.'

Sarah Rouse, 32, said she and her two
children - Chloe, 16, and Lucas, 13 - had all been chased by the dog. 
She said: 'It needs to be locked up and restrained for everyone's 
safety.

Royal Mail spokeswoman Val Boden said they were working with the council and hoped to resume deliveries soon.

 'As far I'm aware no-one else gets threatened by him.

'He's a great dog - it's just that he seems to have an intense hatred of postmen.'

She said: 'Deliveries have already 
been suspended to the address where the dog lives and we have asked the 
owners to keep the dog under control, so that the postman can complete 
his round safely.

'Unfortunately this hasn't happened. Following a number of near misses and a risk assessment of the area, we have had to temporarily suspend deliveries to these properties as a precautionary measure.'

Gena Merrett, Salford's assistant mayor for housing and environment, confirmed they had received a complaint about the dog on Tuesday.

The owner of the dog - described as a large dark brown mixed-breed - could not be contacted.

The curtains of the house were closed and the dog could be heard barking inside.

Some 311 postmen and women were attacked by dogs in the North-West in the 12 months to April last year.

There were 46 dog attacks in Manchester last year, 18 in Bolton, 14 in Oldham, 39 in Stockport, 20 in Warrington, and 15 in Wigan.
