Prince Charles has called for Britain's cities to abandon glitzy skyscrapers in favour of smaller 'mid-rise' buildings in order to ease the housing crisis and allow more young people to own their own homes.  

The heir to the throne added that young people were being 'driven away' by spiralling house prices, saying that the dream of buying a home was 'becoming further and further out of reach'.  

A report released by one of Charles's charities today warns against the influx of high-rise buildings into London, which it claims are making the UK's capital indistinguishable from cities such as Singapore and Dubai.  

Plea: Prince Charles has warned that young people are being frozen out of the housing market

Plan: A report compiled by one of the prince's charity demanded a change to how London is built

The prince was talking at the Housing London Symposium in south west London, to mark the launch of the report by the Prince's Foundation for Building Community.  

The report suggests mid-rise buildings should replace high-rise skyscrapers which it describes as 'glittering towers of exclusivity and luxury living'.  

London has recently seen the construction of prestigious but unaffordable buildings such as One Hyde Park, the Shard and Vauxhall Tower. 

Statistics: Britain is not building enough new homes to meet the demand from citizens

Developers involved with the skyscrapers have been criticised for selling much of their space to foreign investors who do not intend to live in their multi-million-pound flats all year round.  

Instead, the report calls for the construction of 'mid-rise' buildings between five and eight storeys high - and the creation of community squares with mansion blocks which are affordable. 

Across the UK there is an annual need for 250,000 to 300,000 new homes, but only between 100,000 and 150,000 are being built each year.

It has been predicted that be 2021 there will be a backlog of 1.1million homes.

Although One Hyde Park is a lower-rise block, it was built in Knightsbridge, one of London's most expensive property markets, and marketed solely at the super rich, with owners of the 86 luxury apartments including oil barons and Arab sheiks.

Last year one of the apartments in the complex was on the market for £65million, while ten flats in the Shard have price tags of between £30million and £50million.

Prince Charles said today that the focus on ultra-prime housing had damaged young people's prospects of buying a home.  

He said: 'Home ownership for this generation is seemingly becoming further and further out of reach.'

He added: 'The National Housing Federation estimates that in only six years' time the average London house price will have risen 40 per cent to £650,000.  

'This isn't sustainable and risks driving away talented young individuals who are starting their careers in London and spending most of their income on rent.'  

The prince suggested that high-rise buildings divorced from their surrounding created a sense of 'alienation and social dysfunction' because they lead to social segregation with some areas dominated solely by the ultra-rich.  

He added: 'Mid-rise buildings of between five and eight storeys make ecological sense too as they are more adaptable than high-rise, easier to build out of natural materials, are easier to repair and still work for people when the lift is broken or there is a power cut.  

'On the building side, mid-rise buildings also allow a greater diversity of developers and builders as the initial outlays required by high-rise buildings make it the business of relatively few.'  

Criticism: Buildings like One Hyde Park are closed off to all but the wealthiest people in British society

Glamour: But the Shard does little to help most Londoners, according to the new report

Dominic Richards, executive director of the Prince's Foundation, insisted that abandoning skyscrapers and restoring parks and gardens would be truer to London's original character.  

'Mid-rise looks like London - not Singapore or Dubai,' he told the Evening Standard. 'If you have six or seven floors you can still get light on the other side of the road, you can still create green spaces and it fits with the existing vernacular. What we are really saying is "more London please".' 

The report also uses Paris as an example of success, with classic Haussman era apartment blocks in the centre of the city are only around six storeys high.

Mr Richards also suggested that new developments should be accessible to mix of people from different backgrounds, including key workers living in affordable homes.

Last week a leading planning expert warned that parts of Britain would soon resemble 'bland homogenous metropolises' thanks to an emphasis on office blocks and shopping centres at the expense of more organic neighbourhood growth.  

Contrast: Areas such as Notting Hill are popular because of their 'mid-rise' scale,  the report says

The foundation's report recommends the use of brownfield sites and increasing the density of the inner city, as well as building major new developments and restoring housing estates.  

It focuses primarily on London, where inflation in house prices has been even higher than elsewhere, but suggests that its conclusions are widely applicable across other parts of the UK.  

The report reads: 'The problem of housing failures, either in quality or quantity - as well as of the ubiquitous skyscraper model that is beginning to render city skylines indistinguishable from one another, while on the ground streetscapes are brutalised - can be recognised in cities the world over.'
