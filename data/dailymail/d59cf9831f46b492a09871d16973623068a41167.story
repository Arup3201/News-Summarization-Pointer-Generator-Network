Unrepentant: Linda Franklin has no regrets about sleeping with a married man

Exactly a year ago, I instigated the end of one of the most fulfilling, exciting and enduring relationships of my life, by dumping my lover of 12 years.

There was no drama, accusations or poisonous words exchanged. Instead, we'd just made love and were lying in my bed with a cup of tea when I casually mentioned we shouldn't see each other any more.

Matt finished his tea, dressed, kissed me goodbye and walked out of my life. I haven't seen him since. It was without doubt one of the most selfless and generous things I have ever done.

By finishing with Matt, a married father of a little boy, I was setting him free to be the good husband I knew he could be.

This wasn't done out of a sense of guilt or propriety: I'd been sleeping with Matt before and after his marriage. I did it for the sake of his son, who deserved his father's full attention, and I did it for Matt. I sensed he was finally ready to put his indecisive, philandering ways behind him and devote himself to his family.

Though sad to see him go, I didn't regret my decision. I'd always seen our time together as a loan which eventually would have to be called in. And that's why I never had any regrets about deceiving his wife.

As I saw it, I'd borrowed someone's fiance, then husband, and returned him with interest. If it weren't for our affair, I'm sure he'd still be dithering about whether to marry and wouldn't have started a family.

In fact, so encouraging was I that he commit to marriage and family life with another woman that I can't help thinking my lover's wife owes some of her happiness to me.

I met Matt when he was 30 and I was 47, after a mutual friend invited us for a drink one evening.

I'd been divorced for five years following the collapse of my 12-year marriage. My former husband had gone to live in the U.S. after meeting someone on a work trip; our sons were just three and six when he left.

Since my sons had specific learning difficulties and needed a lot of extra help, my time was taken up with looking after them.

I'd gone on some dates and remained hopeful that romance wasn't over for me, though it wasn't at the top of my list  of priorities.

So, I could hardly believe my luck when Matt walked into the bar. He was tall and broad with thick, curly hair and green eyes: good-looking and smiley. I wasn't remotely worried by the fact he was so much younger than me.

Toy boy: Linda was 47 when she started her affair with Matt, who was 17 years younger than her

I like to think I am an attractive woman and I know age is seldom an obstacle when two people are attracted to each other.

Besides, older women bring something very different to a relationship. Without the ticking of a biological clock, we tend to be more relaxed than younger women about relationships.

That night, there was a definite chemistry. I had to get back home early to relieve the babysitter, but I gave Matt my number.

A week or so later, we met for coffee and things developed from there. His job in IT meant he worked flexible hours, so he was able to visit me when my sons were at school.

In many ways I was using Matt. He was an ego boost, a distraction, a nice couple of hours out of my life now and then

It wasn't just a physical relationship, though, of course, that was important. A typical afternoon for us involved a cup of tea, some time in bed and a catch-up on our news and problems.

Matt was always happy to talk about my sons, while I gave him general life advice.

I never hoped or assumed the relationship would go any further. In fact, Matt put it perfectly one afternoon a year after we met: 'You're 17 years older, so nothing long-term is going to happen. Let's just enjoy it for what it is, for as long as it lasts.'

Ever the pragmatist, I was happy to agree. After all, we were at different stages in life.

Did I love him? Yes, at first I suppose I did a little bit, but as time passed, I came to see him for what he was: a charming and handsome man, but ultimately an unfaithful and immature one.

I knew he'd drive me nuts if I lived with him because he was a ditherer and seemed incapable of committing to a long-term relationship.

I know people are going to assume I was being used, but I don't see it that way. In many ways I was using Matt. He was an ego boost, a distraction, a nice couple of hours out of my life now and then. We agreed we were free to date other people, and we did.

I knew Matt wanted to marry and have a family. My priority was my sons. A new relationship would have been wonderful, but it isn't easy to find that when you are a full-time parent without any weekends off. I also came to see that the reason my relationship with Matt worked so well was that we avoided the mundane and domestic.

Brief encounters: Linda said she enjoyed her physical relationship with Matt which was not encumbered with domesticity (posed by models)

Familiarity never bred contempt because we only saw each other in a succession of brief romantic encounters.

He never met my sons; I never asked about his girlfriends. I felt no jealousy or resentment. My time with Matt was more than enough for me. In 2009, I knew, from the scant information I received from him that Matt had started seeing someone seriously and they'd moved in together.

I was surprised he still wanted to carry on with our arrangement. I could see what I got out of it, but why was he keen to keep seeing me when he had a girlfriend at home?

His answer was simple: 'I just need to.' I saw that as a sign of his immaturity and unwillingness to commit. Thank God I'm his mistress, not his partner, I thought.

Obviously he needed more than his wife could give him and I didn't pose a threat to his marriage

The relationship did have its pauses, sometimes for several months, as Matt dithered over the direction his life was taking. It was during a break in 2010 that I received a text that he'd married his girlfriend.

He'd never even told me they were engaged, but in my heart I wasn't surprised. I knew it was what he wanted, though I didn't have high hopes for the future of his relationship. Part of me felt sorry for the poor woman.

I was surprised, however, when several months later he called to suggest we meet up.

It was curiosity, in part, that made me agree. I know many will argue that I should have reminded him of the vows he had taken only months earlier, but knowing Matt as I did, I knew he'd blunder into another clandestine affair - possibly with a  woman less discreet and trustworthy than me.

So, he came round and we ended up in bed. We didn't discuss the wedding or his wife. We just picked up where we'd left off several months before.

I never saw Matt's marriage as my moral issue, it was his. If he took chances, that was his problem.

Obviously he needed more than his wife could give him and I didn't pose a threat to his marriage.

One day in the summer of 2011, Matt asked for my advice. He said his wife, who was 37, wanted to start a family. But he wasn't sure.

Advised him to start a family: The mother-of-two believes she has made her lover a better husband

Exasperated, I urged him to get on with it. Time and biology waits for no man, I said, and he could end up regretting not being a father for the rest of his life. Their son, Max, was born within the year.

A few months later, he was back in my bed. Our snuggly, post-coital chat involved him complaining that he had no time for himself. Life was all work and looking after mother and baby, he grumbled.

I reassured him that it might seem like an endless slog at that point, but it would pass and that he and his wife would one day have fun together again.

I told him he was doing well and explained that my former husband and I had slept in separate rooms for six months after our first son was born. Matt said he felt much better after hearing how life as a new parent had been for me.

The next time I saw him, he was much happier. He had bonded with his son and seemed to have taken a giant leap into manhood, so determined was he to do the best for his new family.

He was proud of his wife and child, and I was delighted to see he'd found his stride as a family man.

The time was right to cut him loose and make him commit. I saw our relationship as the last piece in the puzzle. His little boy needed Matt in a way I didn't. It was only fair on them to force his hand.

That was a year ago. I miss him, occasionally, but I sincerely hope he is making a go of family life and is happy.

Do I feel regret or guilt? No - far from being the villain of the piece, I see myself as a fairy godmother. I think Matt's affair with me did his marriage the world of good.
