A team of 'Titanicologists' have solved what is considered to be one of the last great mysteries - or hoaxes - of the doomed luxury liner, over a century after it sank.

A woman who claimed to be the presumed-dead two-year-old daughter of a wealthy family that died on Titanic in 1912 has been exposed as a fraud following extensive DNA tests.

Helen Kramer first came forward in 1940 claiming to be Loraine Allison, a toddler traveling with her parents Hudson and Bess and seven-month-old brother Trevor on the ship.

Hudson Allison was a Canadian entrepreneur and the family traveled with an extensive entourage of servants.

Solved: Helen Kramer first came forward in 1940 claiming to be the presumed-dead daughter of Hudson and Bess Allison, Lorraine Allison, who was two-years-old when she is believed to have died on Titanic. Now over 70 years later, the claims have been debunked through DNA tests

When the ship struck the iceberg, Trevor, who was not with his family at the time, was taken onto a lifeboat by a maid, Alice Cleaver, with both going on to survive.

Both mother and father and Loraine are believed to have died looking for Trevor and skipping their opportunities at being rescued.

Trevor then died in 1929 of ptomaine poisoning.

Kramer mounted a long campaign to be accepted by the surviving members of the wealthy Allison family in the face of strong opposition, The Telegraph reported.

The bitter dispute was expected to have ended in 1992 when Kramer died.

But it was revived on the centenary of the sinking in 2012 when Kramer’s granddaughter, Debrina Woods, from Florida, restated the claim on a series of forums dedicated to the Titanic.

She set up a website highlighting her claim and said she planned to write a book about the story.

She claimed she had found a suitcase belonging to her grandmother which was full of documents substantiating the family case.

She also tried to contact the Allison family and arrange a visit, prompting the intervention of their lawyers to ask her to cease.

A restraining order was taken out to stop Ms Woods scattering her grandmother’s ashes over the Allison family plot in Chesterville, Ontario, with extra security measures put in place after she paid a visit to the area.

If her claim was established, Woods would have been eligible to inherit much of the Allison family wealth.

The debate led to the founding of the Loraine Allison Identification Project by Tracy Oost, a forensic scientist at Laurentian University in Canada and a Titanic researcher.

Oost and some other 'Titanicologists' - as they have come to be known - asked both sides to take part in a screening of their Mitochondrial DNA, which passes through the maternal line.

Sally Kirkelie, the great niece of Loraine’s mother, agreed to take part.

Woods declined, but her half sister, Deanne Jennings, who shared the same mother and same link to Helen Kramer, agreed.

The tests revealed no genetic link between Kramer or Woods and the Allison family, exposing the decades-long mystery as nothing but a great hoax.

The results are proof of what the Allison family have long suspected to be true.

'The Allison's never accepted Mrs Kramer’s claim, but the stress it caused was real,' said David Allison, grandson of Hudson's brother Percy Allison.

'It forced my ancestors to relive painful memories described to me as immeasurable sorrow and unending grief.

'I would like to thank Deanne Jennings and Sally Kirkelie for offering their DNA to stop this harassment. This was a courageous, selfless act, and I will remain forever indebted for their act of kindness.'

Nancy Bergman, a sister of David’s, said: 'These DNA results have uncovered a colossal fraud that has haunted my family for years. It was all about the money …. Debrina wants to write a book and no doubt there are others out there who want to profit from our story. It is our story. Leave us in peace.'

Prof Oost said: 'It is good to have a resolution here, but we mustn’t forget that this is all about one of the more tragic of tales to come from the Titanic. The only mystery that remains now is who was Helen Kramer.'

Kramer first appeared on a radio show called 'We, the People', claiming to have been saved on Titanic at the last minute by her 'father' Hudson Allison, who she said put her in a lifeboat with a man called 'Mr Hyde'.

She said she was raised in England believing Mr Hyde was her father.

She said Mr Hyde told her truth after she requested her birth certificate and shortly before his death, at which point they had moved to the US.

Kramer said Mr Hyde also disclosed his real identity: Thomas Andrews, who had been Titanic’s designer and builder and who was thought to have died in the sinking.

Further investigation suggests Kramer was actually raised in Michigan as Evangline Irene Lee Hyde.

However Woods, 61, a retired chef, is standing by her claims.

She declined to comment on the DNA results, but said she had her own DNA evidence and the support of other members of the Allison family.

The results, she said, will be revealed in a book she is currently writing.

The project echoes the exposure of a similar bogus claim, made by Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Anastasia, the youngest daughter of the Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, who was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918.

After her death, DNA research proved there was no genetic link between the woman and the family.
