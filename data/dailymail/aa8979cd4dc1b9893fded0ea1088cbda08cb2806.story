They stopped short at recreating the famous bongs of Big Ben, but this Russian television news programme seems to have modelled itself almost entirely on ITV's News at 10, using the same music and even copying the motifs on their desk.

RM News features a remarkably similar opening sequence complete with the instantly-recognisable theme music coupled with yellow and black graphics.

The male and female presenters are perched casually behind a white open desk 
decorated with yellow squares just like their ITV counterparts.

Imitation: Russia's RM news bears an uncanny similarity to ITV's ITN news using an  almost identical opening sequence complete with the same theme music

The programme appears to have an 
almost identical format, with the same running order for their mix of 
hard news, human interest, entertainment and sport.

Stories
praising the athletic prowess of Vladamir Putin or debating the cost of
Vodka are interspersed with identical snippets of the theme music although the Russian team appear to have have stopped short of mimicking ITV's light-hearted And Finally section.

An
edition of the Russian programme was posted on YouTube where one 
bemused, presumably British, viewer posted: 'Y U﻿ NO HAVE ALASTAIR 
STEWART?!' referring to the ITV newscaster.

Role models: News at 10's current presenters Mark Austin and Julie Etchingham

Imitators: The Russian presenters sit at their almost identical desk in front of a strikingly similar backdrop

The famous theme music, entitled The
Awakening, was written by British composer Johnny Pearson who led the 
Top of The Pops orchestra for 16 years.

It is not the first time the theme music has been mimicked. The 2008 video game Saints Row 2, features a news broadcast using the theme as does the 2009 video game Ratchet & Clank Future.

Other examples of Pearson's work included the theme music to  All Creatures Great and Small and Captain Pugwash.

In the United States, his composition Heavy Action is used for ABC's Monday Night Football.
