Ex-footballer Stan Collymore has told how he is receiving up to 200 vile hate messages a day by internet trolls

Ex-footballer Stan Collymore has 
told how he is receiving up to 200 vile hate messages from users on a social network site, with one branding him a 'monkey.'

The
former Liverpool and England striker said he had considered quitting 
Twitter because of the amount of daily abuse he was receiving - despite a
law student appearing in court after sending him racially abusive 
tweets.

The talkSPORT radio pundit re-tweeted one of the racist messages he had received from  one user who wrote: '@StanCollymore why are u black? U look like
a monkey.'

Using the code name Wpww-hooligan-88m, the user's Twitter profile states 'My blood is my honour, my 
race is my pride and who profile picture is a swastika with the words 
white power on

Immediately Collymore, 42, tweeted: 'Had enough of 
twitter tbf but won’t go because it’s a great work tool, and too much 
positive feedback. Sick of the daily abuse though.

'I must get 150-200 abusive messages a
day now, just constant reminders of stuff that happened a long time a 
go. Not nice at all.

One of the offensive comments that Stan Collymore received and re-tweeted as an example on the social networking site

Former Spurs and England striker Gary Lineker sent Collymore a message to offer his support

'Easy to say ignore it when you see it 200 times a day.

'Thanks for the support from people 
who support clubs all over the place.You’re why I tweet, it’s really 
that simple. Really grateful.'

Former Spurs and England striker Gary
Lineker messaged Collymore to offer his support saying: '@StanCollymore
My God! What is wrong with people? Actually he doesn’t qualify as a 
human being. He is the animal!'

Collymore replied: '@garylineker Cheers Gary.Legend.'

Lineker replied: '@StanCollymore You should never ignore it! None of us should!'

Collymore tweeted his thanks to followers who has messaged him offering their support, but he said it was 'not nice at all'

The latest abuse comes after a law 
student admitted racially abusing Collymore on Twitter.

Joshua Cryer, of Jesmond, appeared 
before Newcastle magistrates to face a public order charge after a 
complaint from the radio pundit.

The 21-year-old Newcastle University student has previously denied sending messages in January that were 'grossly offensive.'

Magistrates adjourned the case for a further hearing on 21 March.

Cryer was arrested in January after Collymore reported the incident police.

In a tweet at the time he wrote to the student: 'Not
having this cr*p any more. Joshua, I see you've deleted your tweets. I 
haven't. Two officers have a statement and evidence. See you in court.

It is not the first that Collymore, who has publicly battled depression, has previously spoken about offensive messages he has received on the social networking site.

Last month Micah Richards closed down his Twitter account after suffering racist abuse from fans on the social network site

In 2009, he decided to quit his account, although he later re-joined, after receiving several spiteful messages.

Collymore wrote: 'Hi everyone, after a bit of thought, ive decided to bin twitter.

'It was all meant to be footie and a bit of fun but way too much personal abuse about and one or two people intent on making a name for themselves at the expense of others has made me realise that despite 3 odd thousand that like the banter, ask relevant, funny questions, and get what its about, there are some seriously strange people on here.'

Earlier that week, Collymore had warned Tweeters following his updates that jokes about depression would not be welcome.

Last month Micah Richards closed down his Twitter account after suffering racist abuse from fans on the social network site.

The Manchester City defender asked police to investigate before reluctantly deciding to shut his account @officialMR2.

A source said: ‘Micah thought about closing it in November because of racist abuse from a small but persistent number of people, but decided atthat time to carry on because he enjoyed being able to communicate directly with City fans.

‘Unfortunately it continued and he has decided now that enough is enough.’

It is understood police are still investigating.
