Mountaineer Mike Pescod fought through blizzards to make his way up the 13,000-ft high Barre de Ecrins mountain in the French Alps.

The 42-year-old adventurer braved the elements and snow-covered peaks in return for a range of incredible images.  

Mike has worked as a full-time mountain guide for 14 years and has scaled Scotland's Ben Nevis, the Alps, Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya during his time as a climber.

No fear! The 42-year-old adventurer, from Fort William, Scotland, has worked as a full-time mountain guide for 14 years

The snow-covered peak in the French Alps offered an incredible background for a series of impressive images

Mike, whose home in Fort William lies a stone's throw away from Ben Nevis, is now gearing up for another brutal winter of climbs with his peers.

He said: 'I'm very lucky to be able to call this my job - I absolutely love it.

'I work all year round as a mountain guide but obviously the winter months are notoriously difficult because of the weather.

In addition to the Alps, Mr Pescod has also scaled Scotland's Ben Nevis, Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya

Mr Pescod holds the highest worldwide qualification for instruction and guiding in rock and ice climbing, mountaineering and ski touring 

'The temperatures are really starting to drop and climbs will get really tricky when the snow falls.

'But it's a great test and people who come to me for training are always well up for the challenge.

'Barre de Ecrins was a fantastic experience - the weather was brutal but it was a brilliant trip.'

Mike Pescod says he became a guide because he wants people to get the same thrills that he experiences while climbing

Mike, who has run Abacus Mountain Guides since 2000, said: 'I've always been active and my three children are exactly the same. 

'They're all as excited as I am when it starts snowing in the winter.

'I want people to enjoy climbs as much as I do which is why I got into being a guide so many years ago.'
