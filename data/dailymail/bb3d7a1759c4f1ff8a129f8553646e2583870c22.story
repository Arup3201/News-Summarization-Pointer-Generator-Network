Dappy appeared before a judge at St Albans Crown Court after breaching his probation order

A judge has ordered N-Dubz rapper Dappy to behave but said he will not go back to jail - despite breaching his sentence for punching a nightclubber.

The 27-year-old, whose real name is Costadinos Contostavlos, arrived at St Albans Crown Court after he reportedly missed a probation appointment and showed up late for a 'self-control' workshop.

He was serving a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty in September of assaulting a football coach on the dancefloor of Evissa nightclub in Reading, Berkshire.  

Dappy was also subject to a four-month curfew with an electronic tag keeping him at home between 10pm and 5am and ordered him to pay a fine and compensation. 

The attack happened after the rapper began chatting to a man's girlfriend and female friend and got into a brawl with coach Devonn Reid, leaving him with a bleeding nose. 

Mr Reid was out celebrating his 21st birthday at the club when he asked the rapper to stop talking to the women. 

Dappy denied the attack, claiming he had felt threatened by a 'group of six or seven big boys' at the bar and said he'd been pulled away by a bouncer before a punch was thrown.  

He was also serving another suspended sentence at the time for spitting in the face of two teenage girls at a petrol station in Guildford, Surrey, in February 2012, while on a night out.

The former Celebrity Big Brother star and cousin of singer Tulisa Contostavlos, was also fined £800 last year for slapping a man at a nightclub in Chelmsford, Essex.

Arriving at court on Wednesday, the rapper carried a packed black bag in preparation for a custodial sentence.

Wearing a white shirt done up to the collar with no tie and black pullover, he stood in the dock to admit two charges of breaching the conditions of his probation that was imposed as part of a suspended sentence at Guilford crown court on November 6 last year.

The court heard that on December 2, he failed to attend an appointment with a probation officer and on December 17 he arrived late for a 'Thinking Skills Programme' group workshop, which aimed to get him to improve his self-control and curb negative behaviour.

At the start the hearing Helen Flavell, for Hertfordshire probation service, told Judge John Plumstead: 'There were two breaches of the order. He appears to have prioritised other things over his attendance on the programme.'

She said that there had also been 10 breaches of his curfew 10pm to 6am when he had arrived home late, which amounted to two hours and 15 minutes.

Jon Harrison, defending, said Dappy had 'outstanding commitments' to HMRC and his mortgage provider, but had recently received a 'block of money' to reduce what he owes.

He said the December 17 offence was caused by lateness and was not a 'flagrant breach'. He said he had not caused the group session to be stopped.

Judge Plumstead said: 'He will have to shape up and behave. Probation officers are not just there waiting to see him. They have a full diary and public money is being wasted. If he breaches the conditions again he will be locked up. It is in his hands.'

The singer put his hands together in prayer as the judge told him: 'What you did is a form of rudeness. Probation officers work extremely hard. 

'They are over-stretched, under-funded and short in numbers. If they make time for you it is important for you to turn up. I hope you have learned your lesson and will co-operate.'

Dappy, of North Mymms, Hertfordshire, admitted breaching his probation order and was fined £1,000 - £500 for each offence. He was also ordered to pay £200 prosecution costs, which he has three months to pay. 

The court heard he must stand before a judge in three months time for a review. As he left the eight-minute long hearing and told friends: 'Let's get out of here'. 

'I have got to take it seriously,' he told reporters outside court. 'When I missed the appointment my phone had smashed and and I did not see a text. So unfortunately I did not know I had to go that day. It was a silly mistake and the second time I was late.'

He said he had got his tax problems sorted out and had an album coming out in February.  

At the original hearing for the 2013 nightclub assault, his defence lawyer told the court the rapper was struggling financially, having put his house up for sale to pay large tax debts he had run up.

Jon Harrison added Dappy had 'underlying issues' and wanted to 'address the root cause of his bad reactions to other people'.

The singer has been seeing a psychiatrist, the court heard, who said the death of Dappy's father had had a big impact on him.  

In December 2008, Dappy pleaded guilty to two accounts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, Essex, after spitting in a girl's face while drunk on a night out.  He was given a suspended sentence for 12 months, 100 hours community service, £50 compensation to the girl and her friend and £300 costs. 

In January 2009 he was arrested and bailed after he was accused of making death threats with a gun, but denied the allegation. Three days later he was removed from an Edinburgh to London flight by police after appearing to be acting disorderly.

A year later, Dappy appeared on The Chris Moyles Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 1 with N-Dubz bandmates Fazer and Tulisa. A woman in Boston, Lincolnshire, sent a text to the show complaining Dappy was 'vile' and 'a little boy with a silly hat'. He secretly copied her phone number and the following day sent threatening messages. His management apologised and offered her free concert tickets but the band was subsequently dropped from the Government's anti-bullying 'R U Cyber Safe?' campaign.

In April 2010 CCTV pictures surfaced of Dappy taking the illegal drug Mephedrone in a nightclub and he appeared on GMTV to apologise.

Shortly after the incident he was asked to leave Alton Towers theme park hotel in Staffordshire for allegedly smoking cannabis.

In October 2011, Dappy was arrested on suspicion of assaulting the mother of his two children, Kaye Vassell, and was later released without charge.

Four months later in February 2012 he was arrested and bailed on suspicion of affray, along with another man, after he was alleged to have spat at two women at a petrol station in Guildford, Surrey.

He had been celebrating the release of his single Rockstar at the Casino nightclub and was on the way to the recording studios in Godalming when they stopped at a Shell garage where a brawl broke out and was found guilty of affray one assault offence in January 2013.

He was given a six-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months.

In February 2014 he was convicted of common assault and fined £800 after he hit at man at a nightclub in Chelmsford, Essex. The incident, which was captured on CCTV, erupted at Chicago Rock Cafe after clubber George Chittock called him 'a mug'. 

On 6 October 2013, Dappy hit a man on his nose at a nightclub in Reading, Berkshire and was convicted of assault at Reading Magistrates' Court.

A judge handed him a two-month jail term, suspended for 12 months, a four-month curfew with an electronic tag keeping him at home between the hours of 10pm and 5am and ordered him to pay a fine and compensation.

His most recent appearance at court on Wednesday was for breaching his suspended sentence after he reportedly failed to turn up to a probation appointment and arrived late for a workshop aimed at improving his self-control. He admitted the breach and was fined £1,000.
