These are the some of the men accused of recruiting children as young as 10 into a 'criminal army' of Roma immigrants.

Twenty-seven gypsies squeezed into the dock at a court in Nancy, France, today, accused of hundreds of crimes ranging from people trafficking to robbery.

Some of the men are also alleged to have bought 13-year-old girls for up to £170,000 and forced them to be their wives.

Exploitation: Twenty-seven people have been accused of selling women for stealing skills and using children like conscripts in a criminal army

Cramped: The group, who squeezed into the dock at the court in Nancy, France, have been charged with over 100 robberies in 2011 in France, Belgium and parts of Germany

Each of the group face up to 10 years in prison for their crimes, which included more than 100 robberies committed in various locations across France.

The network, which is ran by a 66-year-old woman expected boys and girls to bring in at least £4000 a month through robbing people in the street or in their homes.

Male leaders ‘bought young wives’ for the cash equivalent of up to £170,000 each from other families in Croatia, and selected them especially for their stealing skills.

The better they were at stealing, the higher the price was,’ said Mr Weintz.

‘Young looking women also commanded higher prices because they had a better chance of passing themselves off as minors.

The hearing comes the same day dozens of Roma families take up the 
offer by the French government of a free ticket out of the country, while dozens of polices raided gypsy camps around the country and carried out identity checks.

Huge numbers of Roma families checked in at an airport in Lille, northern France.

The
 Roma gypsies voluntary return to their home nation follows 
controversial statements by two French ministers regarding the EU’s open
 border policies.

Last week, Interior minister Manuel Valls said that most Roma in France will never 
integrate and should be sent back to their countries of origin.

Shortly
 after Mr Vall's controversial statement, Foreign minister Laurent 
Fabius chimed in, saying Romanians and Bulgarians should be prevented 
from travelling around Europe freely.

Referring
 to the Schengen Agreement, which allows people to move across 26 
European countries without passport checks, Mr Fabius said: ‘If there is
 not a change in conditions, we won’t be in favour.

‘People coming from outside Europe could enter Romania and Bulgaria and then freely enter the rest of Europe.’

His comments followed the explosive words of Interior minister Mr Valls, calling for Roma gypsies to return to their home countries.

In an interview on the France Inter radio station, Mr Valls said: ‘The Roma should return to Romania or Bulgaria.’

Cast out: Manuel Valls has called for Roma to be 'gradually' moved across the border and back to their home countries, in most cases Romania and Bulgaria

The
 Socialist Party member added: ‘Yes, we must tell the truth to the 
French – these populations have a way of life that is extremely 
different to ours, and they are obviously in confrontation with local 
populations.’

Illegal Roma camps have sprung up on 
the edges of major cities such as Paris and Marseille. All have become 
associated with widespread crime and major health hazards.

Mr
 Valls, who was born in Barcelona, said: ‘It is unrealistic to think we 
will solve the problem of Roma populations only through integration.’

He said there is ‘no alternative but to dismantle these camps and gradually move them across the border’.

The European Commission immediately threatened sanctions against France for its policy towards the Roma community.

A spokesman insisted everyone from Bulgaria and Rumania was a citizen of the EU and therefore had a right to travel anywhere.

Three
 years ago the Commission’s vice president, Viviane Reding, sent a 
similar threat to former president Nicolas Sarkozy, saying that Roma 
expulsions had to stop.

Despite the fierce criticism, Mr Valls has remained defiant, insisting: 
‘The majority [of Roma] should be delivered back to the borders. We are 
not here to welcome these people.

‘I’d
 remind you of [former Socialist premier] Michel Rocard’s statement 
“it’s not France’s job to deal with the misery of the whole world”.’

One
 of Mr Valls’s own cabinet colleagues, Arnaud Montebourg, hit back, pointing 
to the fact the minister’s family were migrants from Spain.

Mr
 Montebourg said: ‘A theory that such and such a person or such and such
 a people will never, ever be able to integrate just doesn’t stand up.

‘Decreeing in advance that it is impossible seems to me excessive and is worthy of being corrected.’

But Mr Valls said: ‘I’ve got nothing to correct. My remarks only shock those who don’t know the subject.’

Jean-Francois
 Cope, the leader of the opposition UMP party, meanwhile told France 
Info radio station that Roma criminals regularly  ‘harassed Parisians’.

Referring
 to the Schengen agreement which allows people to move across Europe 
without passport checks, Mr Cope said both Romania and Bulgaria should 
be excluded.

‘We close our 
eyes to the French government to what is happening in our country – the 
constant violence’, he said.

‘This is extremely serious and…it is out of
 the question that Bulgaria and Romania enter the Schengen area until 
the problem is resolved at the European level.’

There
 are an estimated 15,000 Roma gipsies in France. Two years ago the then 
interior minister, Claude Gueant, claimed the vast majority of street 
robberies in Paris were carried out by Romanian immigrants.

Controversial: France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he will ban those from Romania and Bulgaria, including gypsies, from the EU's passport-free zone

Row: Some French politicians have opposed proposals which would see illegal Roma encampments broken up and their residents deported

Checks: French police officers walk between the caravans and rubbish surrounding the camp
