A North Carolina math teacher has been allowed to keep her job despite allegedly saying she wanted to 'kill all black people.'

Cynthia Ramsey, head of the math department at Camden County High School in North Carolina, allegedly said to a student that if she only had ten days left to live, her bucket list would include 'killing all black people'.

The conversation is alleged to have taken place in her classroom this week, and shortly afterwards she was suspended but then reinstated.

School: Cynthia Ramsey is head of the math department at Camden County High School in North Carolina

Racist: Ramsey told a student that one of the things on her ‘bucket list’ would be to kill all black people'

Job: Ramsey was placed on suspension with pay. But she has now been reinstated.

Kimberly Ashcraft, the mother of the Camden County High student who reported the teacher's offensive comments told WAVY: ‘It is very disturbing.’

Ashcraft's daughter said  Ramsey was in her classroom along with several other students who were eating lunch.

In the course of a conversation  Ramsey began to talk about what she would do if she knew she was going to die.

‘Mrs. Ramsey [indicated] that if she only had 10 days to live that she would kill all black people,’ Ashcraft told WAVY. The remark left the student and the student’s mother shocked. 

‘I was completely shocked,’ she continued. ‘I asked her again, ‘Are you sure that was what you heard?’ I could not have imagined a teacher saying that.’ 

Disgust: As the teacher returns to her post, Kimberly Ashcraft said she is disappointed in the decision

But she assured her mother that other students had also overheard the teacher making the remark.

School officials launched an investigation   into Ramsey’s alleged remarks and the Camden County Sheriff’s Office was also called in.

The sheriff confirmed that several other students were in the classroom at the time  that Ramsey had  said 'she would kill all black people.' 

Ramsey was placed on suspension with pay. But has now been reinstated.

Yet as the teacher returns to her post, Ashcraft said she is disappointed in the decision.

'I was very disappointed to hear that she was back in the classroom so soon,' she said.

Camden County Schools' superintendent said that the board has investigated the incident 'thoroughly.'

However he said that Ramsey's remarks were of a 'personnel issue,' but the board would follow protocol in the investigation.

The superintendent also stated that the facts of the case would remain 'confidential until resolved.' 

In another development, Camden County’s sheriff gave the evidence in the case to the district attorney.

Ramsey a teacher at the school for 17 years could still face charges depending on the outcome of the attorney’s investigation into the incident. 

The school board has also announced that it plans to discuss Ramsey’s case on November 13 and Ashcraft hopes that justice will be served.

'As a parent I felt compelled to come forward and tell somebody, because this was not only in my opinion a direct threat to the black children in the school, but also black people in the community.'
