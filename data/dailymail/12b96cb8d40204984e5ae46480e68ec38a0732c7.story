Shocked: Julie Wakeling had fed six week-old Skahayla from the £10 tin of Cow & Gate anti-reflux formula when she spotted a needle lurking in the powdered milk

A leading baby food manufacturer is investigating after a mother found a two-inch needle in her tiny daughter’s milk powder.

Julie Wakeling had already fed six week-old Skahayla from the £10 tin of Cow & Gate anti-reflux formula when she spotted the spike lurking in the powdered milk.

The angry 26-year-old from Sittingbourne in Kent had bought the tin in a supermarket near her home, and said that unnoticed the could have pierced her baby’s bottle and cut the infant.

'It was as I did the last scoop I noticed something shiny,' she said.

'I moved the formula away with the scoop and then I could see it was a needle.

'I was worried because I had already fed her with some it from the tin. My main fear was that it was a contaminated needle.

'I’m concerned other tins may have been contaminated and would warn other mums to be on the look out.

'What if it had gone in the bottle and pierced the teat and hurt her mouth?'

Miss Wakeling,a mother-of-three, immediately complained to manufacturers Danone Baby Nutrition UK and has sent the company the needle for analysis.

A spokesman for the company said Danone was confident that the needle, believed to have been a sewing needle, had not originated in one of its factories.

'We were concerned to hear from Miss Wakeling about her complaint,' she said.

'The pack and needle Miss Wakeling sent us are now being investigated at our laboratory. 

'From our initial examinations, we believe the needle to be a sewing needle. 

'As part of our quality controls systems, all our sealed packs of milk are x-rayed before they leave our factory.  We have now repeatedly tested the pack and needle on our x-ray machine and the pack was immediately rejected each time.  For this reason we are confident that the needle did not originate from our factory. 

Find: Ms Wakeling, a mother of three, said the needle could have pierced her baby's bottle and cut the infant

'However we will continue our investigations and provide Miss Wakeling with a full report.

'We can reassure parents that this is an isolated incident and we have 
not received any similar complaints for any other Cow & Gate 
product.

'Cow & Gate are committed to manufacturing high-quality baby foods 
and parents can continue to use our products with confidence.'

Full-time mother Miss Wakeling, who lives with partner Shaun Harbour, son Archie, one, and daughter Ronnie, seven bought the product from the Asda store in Sittingbourne after Shakayla started suffering from reflux.

A spokeswoman from ASDA said that as the formula was not one of their branded products the supermarket chain would not comment on the find.
