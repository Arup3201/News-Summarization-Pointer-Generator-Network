They are less than two weeks old, but these piglets already have wrinkles and are making history.

The litter of eight Meishan piglets are the first of their kind to be born in the UK for thirty years.

The breed, with their long floppy ears and wrinkly faces, is popular in China but has never been properly introduced in this country.

One of a kind: The first litter of rare Meishan piglets in the UK for 30 years was born at Whauphill Farm in Dumfries and Galloway

Owner Linda McDonald-Brown, 51, brought 
the litter’s year-old mother Miep and nine-month-old father Wrinkles 
over from northern Holland with husband Graham, 47, last year.

And two weeks ago Miep gave birth to seven girls and one boy.

The couple plan to start the UK’s first pedigree line of the species and have already sold two of the litter to a smallholder in Essex.

Linda, from Wigtown, Dumfries and Galloway, now intends to bring other boars in from Eastern Europe to create a foundation Meishan family from which every pig in the UK will descend.

She said: ‘We are really pleased with the birth. They are the first to be born in this country for about 30 years so it’s very exciting to be involved.

Proud mother: Miep gave birth to her new brood two weeks ago

Hello! Four of the piglets peek out from their sty. Meishans are a popular breed in China because of their unusually large ears and wrinkly faces

‘We went across to Holland to stay with a friend who also breeds pigs. We didn’t set out with the intention of buying anything but when I saw them I just fell in love with them and bought two sows then and there and later a boar.

‘I have never seen anything like them in my life.

‘They are really prolific breeders in China and are very popular because of their unusual appearance and fatty meat but for some reason they have never taken off here and I want to change that.’

Curious: The litter contains seven girls and one boy and two have already been sold to a smallholder in Essex

The two sows and boar cost Linda £2,000 as a trio and each female can litter up to 15 babies.

The Meishan species is native to southern China and when fully grown can measure up to three feet high and four feet long.

Meishans were last seen in the UK over 30 years ago, when 20 pigs were imported from China by a British genetics company for research purposes, but the animals were never bred.

The species’ ability to produce large litters means they have also become popular in the US and Canada in recent years.

One big happy family: Mrs McDonald-Brown bought a trio of pigs for £2,000. Each female can litter up to 15 piglets

Best foot forward: The piglets take their some of their first tentative steps outside of the safety of their pigsty

Mother-of-two Linda, originally from Bideford, in Devon, has been breeding pigs for 15 years.

She added: ‘Meishans are brilliant outdoor animals to have, they have a lovely temperament and they are brilliant with children.

‘They are not pets by any means - they can’t be kept in the house like micro-pigs, but they are fantastic to keep and it would be great to see them take off in this country.’
