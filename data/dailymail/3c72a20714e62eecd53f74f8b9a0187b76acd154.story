Chelsea fans made clear what they thought of racism the same day police announced they were hunting a gang of men, believed to be fans of the club, who were heard shouting bigoted chants at St Pancras International.

The incident, which took place at London St Pancras on Wednesday evening at around 8pm, happened the day after fans of the same club were filmed allegedly pushed a black man off a Paris Metro while shouting a racist chant.

An investigation is currently underway after a member of the public reported the men, who had travelled by train from Paris Gard du Nord, reported the incident to British Transport Police.

'Support Chelsea. Support Equality' is the message to fans before today's home Premier League fixture

A banner reading 'Black or white, we're all blue' was unfurled at Stamford Bridge before this afternoon's Premier League clash with Burnley.

The club's reputation has taken a major hit after fans were filmed apparently pushing a black man off a Paris Metro and singing a racist song before Tuesday's one-all Champions League draw against Paris St Germain.

Stickers emblazoned with 'Support Chelsea Support Equality' have been handed out, and the first team squad all wore t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan as they warmed up.

By coincidence, the club had already designated the fixture as its annual 'Game for Equality'.

The club's matchday program denounced the abuse over several pages, including a column by captain John Terry, who served a four-match Football Association ban in 2012 after the governing body found him guilty of racially abusing then-Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand in a game.

'This club stands against all forms of discrimination,' Terry wrote. 

'Football is a sport for everyone, that is one of the main reasons why we love it.'  

Wednesday's incident is believed to have happened as fans were returning home after attending the game in the French capital the night before. 

The group of men, thought to be Chelsea fans, were walking through St Pancras International station after getting off a train from Paris when they reportedly engaged in racist chanting

They had been travelling back from the French capital on the 6.40pm Eurostar service, said BTP

Superintendent Gill Murray, of British Transport Police, said: 'The racist chanting was reported by a member of the public who was disgusted by the behaviour of the men who had travelled on the 6.40pm service from Paris Gard du Nord.

'The men shouted as they walked through the station having alighted from the train a short time earlier.

'If you travelled on the train from Paris or were at the station and have information which can assist our investigation I would urge you to get in touch as a matter of urgency.'

Ms Murray continued: 'It's clear that unfortunately there is still a minority who think it is acceptable to behave in such an abhorrent manner. 

'There is more that needs to be done to publicly condemn this type of behaviour and British Transport Police is actively working with football clubs, the football authorities and other key agencies to tackle this appalling behaviour.' 

Police are seeking three more Chelsea football fans they believe were involved in Tuesday's allegedly racist incident at the Richelieu-Drouot station of the Paris Metro.

Paris Metro incident victim Souleymane S has since spoken out about his ordeal at the hands of Chelsea fans

Five people have so far been suspended from the club's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into what happened and face lifetime bans if they're found guilty of any offence.

Images have been released in a bid to identify the trio, who the Met think were among a group of Chelsea supporters involved in the incident while on their way to the Champions League last-16 clash.

In a video filmed on a mobile phone the fans could apparently be heard chanting: 'We're racist and that's the way we like it.'

That incident was filmed by a passenger and brought widespread condemnation, from the United Nations to British Prime Minister David Cameron and FIFA President Sepp Blatter.

Chelsea have said they are 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, identified only as 33-year-old Souleymane S, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved at a press conference yesterday.

Souleymane has said the incident is the club's 'responsibility'. 

In an interview yesterday the father-of-three said what happened had left him 'really afraid', and that he was 'stunned' it could have occurred in 2015.

He also told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive: 'I felt truly wounded to the bottom of my heart and I really couldn't believe it.'

The club said it has also invited him and his family to London to attend the second leg of the European clash against PSG on March 11.

French police investigating the Paris Metro incident have handed the pictures of seven men they believe to be involved to their British counterparts.

The Met confirmed they had received the images of seven people thought to have witnessed or taken part in the incident on Tuesday.

If you know anything about the incident at St Pancras on Wednesday you can call the BTP on 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016.

The amateur footage goes on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident of xenophobic chanting, in which fans could be heard to sing 'We're racist and that's the way we like it'
