S. Truett Cathy, the founder of the U.S.
fast food chain Chick-fil-A which drew protests two years ago
when its president made public statements opposing same-sex
marriage, died on Monday aged 93, the company said on its
website.

Cathy, who was Chick-fil-A's chairman emeritus, died at home
in the presence of loved ones, the privately held Atlanta-based
company said.

It did not disclose a cause of death.

The company, which operates from 1,800 locations in 40 U.S. states, is known for its mix of religion and business as well as its fried chicken sandwiches and waffle fries

Funeral plans had not yet been finalized.

In 2012 the chicken sandwich chain made headlines when its
president Dan Cathy -- the founder's son -- made comments to 
the Baptist Press citing 'prideful' supporters of same-sex
marriage and defending the company's support of 'the biblical
definition of the family unit.'

The comments ignited a cultural firestorm, triggering
protests including 'kiss-ins' by same-sex couples outside some
stores, as well as support from social conservatives and fans of
its products.

The Jim Henson Co. pulled its Muppet toys from kids' meals, while 
politicians in Boston and Chicago told the chain it is not welcome 
there.

Chick-fil-A issued a statement saying its culture is 'to
treat every person with honor, dignity and respect - regardless
of their belief, creed, race, sexual orientation or gender.'

S. Truett Cathy, a native of the U.S. state of Georgia and a
devout Southern Baptist, founded Chick-fil-A in 1967.

The company, which operates from 1,800 locations in 40 U.S.
states, is known for its mix of religion and business as well as
its fried chicken sandwiches and waffle fries.

All locations are closed on Sundays to allow employees 'a
day for family, worship, fellowship or rest,' according to the
company's website.

Over ensuing decades, the chain's boneless chicken sandwich he is credited with inventing would propel Chick-fil-A expansion to more than 1,800 outlets in 39 states and the nation's capital.

By early 2013, the company says on its website, annual sales topped $5 billion as the chain offered up a taste of the South that went beyond chicken to such offerings as sweet tea, biscuits and gravy.

Cathy's $6 billion fortune as the founder of Chick-fil-A puts him on the yearly Forbes magazine list of the wealthiest Americans in the country.

The company has listed him on its website as its chairman emeritus after he left day-to-day operations to younger generations.

Truett Cathy began his career in the restaurant business by opening with his brother in 1946 an Atlanta diner called The Dwarf Grill, which was named for the short and stout shape of the restaurant.

He has attributed his hardworking nature — even as a little boy he made money by selling six bottles of Coca-Cola for a quarter — to growing up poor.

'I've experienced poverty and plenty and there's a lesson to be learned when you're brought up in poverty,' he said in 2007. 'I had to create some good work habits and attitude.'

Cathy, seen here in 2008 with then President George W. Bush, received the Lifetime President's Volunteer Service Award

Even well into his 80s, Cathy was actively involved in the chain's operations, including setting up a contract with his children that said they may sell the privately-owned chain in the future but the company must never go public.

'Why would I retire from something I enjoy doing?' Cathy said in a 2007 interview. 'I can hardly wait to get here.'

An opportunity in 1961 led to the development of the restaurant chain's trademark chicken sandwich when a company that cooked boneless, skinless chicken for airline meals wanted to sell him pieces that were too big for the airline customer's needs.

Cathy took those pieces and cooked them in a pressure cooker and served them in buttered buns.

The sandwich was sold at independent 
restaurants for a few years before he opened his first Chick-fil-A 
restaurant at an Atlanta shopping mall in 1967.

Cathy
 also was known for his efforts to help youth. In 1984 he created the 
WinShape Foundation to help 'shape winners' through youth support 
programs and scholarships.

He also created a long-term program for foster children that has foster care homes in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Brazil.

Cathy was also known for his kindness towards children, starting a program for foster children and supporting scholarship and youth programs

His sympathy for children was demonstrated in August 2008 when he worked out a deal with the parents of two girls who were accused of causing $30,000 in damage to a home he owned in New Smyrna Beach, Florida.

The girls were banned from watching TV and playing video games.

They also had to write 'I will not vandalize other people's property' 1,000 times.

He told the Daytona Beach News-Journal that he didn't want to have them prosecuted and left with a criminal record.

As the author of several books, his 2007 book 'How Did You Do It, Truett?' outlined his strategy for success that included setting priorities, being courteous, cautiously expanding a business and not being burdened with debt.

'There's really no secret for success,' he said then. 'I hope it will open eyes for people. They don't have to follow my recipe but this is what works for me.'
