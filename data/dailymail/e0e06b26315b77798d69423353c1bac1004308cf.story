In compensation for a small piece of land taken by the Victorian government, to build an extra highway lane, elite private school, Scotch College has been given a staggering $5.4 million.

The Age reports in 2008, VicRoads used land acquisition powers to take over a thin piece of land, alongside the Hawthorn boys' school in Melbourne's east, in a bid to use it to expand the Monash Freeway, part of Citylink.

The strip of land is at the back of the college near Gardiners creek and construction of the extra lane was completed in 2010.

It's believed a payment for the land was made by the government's road authority to the college only just late last year, as identified in the school's 2013 revenue records.

A small piece of land in the vicinity of the area marked was bought by the state government for $5.4 million after he took the land to build an extra lane for the Citylink

In 2008, the prestigious school knocked back a $1 million offer from the State Government as well as compensation for occupancy of the land during construction, and instead took the state government to court to get more money.

It's believed the VicRoads offer was determined following a valuation from then valuer general Jack Dunham. 

But although the deal was a long drawn out process the school finally received sufficient compensation. 

'The final compensation amount paid to Scotch College was determined through the Valuers' negotiations and assessment of the matters being claimed,' said Agnelo Duarte, Director of technical services at VicRoads.

'The compensation amount paid to Scotch College covered land and severance, temporary occupation of Scotch College land throughout the project, costs pre and post referral to court, solatium and interest pursuant to the act.'

'A range of expert valuation and legal advice was sought to determine the final amount and the final amount was also endorsed by the Government Land Monitor,' he said.

A spokesperson for Scotch College confirmed the value of the land was the subject of negotiation during Supreme Court action.

'The final amount received also included payment for disruptions to school operations, the need to repair grounds following loss and damage, the reimbursement of other costs, and rent for the use of property by the construction companies throughout the project.' 

Former Liberal party MP and Scotch college council member, Dr David Kemp told The Age he had no personal role in negotiations over payment for the land, despite heading up a taskforce to ensure the school got fairly compensated. 

A spokesman for Roads Minster Terry Mulder said the issue wasn't really concerning the minister as things had been settled in court.

However he did confirm that Dr Kemp was not personally involved in negotiations. 

The Australian Education Union says the extensive payment demonstrated the poor track record the Napthine government had with public education.

'It has a poor record for supporting public schools,' said the union's Victorian president, Meredith Pearce.

'It has made a payment to one of Victoria's wealthiest schools but refused to be transparent about the hundreds of millions of dollars coming through the Gonski deal.'

Ms Pearce says additional state and federal government money is in the coffers yet it's secret as to where and how that money is being spent.

'The additional money is paying for things the state government doesn't have to pay for, like land at Scotch, and it should be paying for that out of it's own budget,' she said.
