Channel 4 has been accused of racism over its posters advertising its latest Big Fat Gypsy Wedding series.

Adverts used to promote the show have been criticised for using the words: 'Bigger. Fatter. Gypsier' 
in large letters across images of travellers, including one of young gypsy girls.

But the London Travellers' Unit and two members of the London Assembly have likened the word 'gypsier' to other terms deemed racist and abusive and have written to Channel 4 to complain.

The posters have appeared all over the 
country on billboards over the past few weeks in the run up to the 
launch of the six-part series.

It has sparked outrage among the 
traveller community in Hackney, in East London, who even staged a street
protest in opposition.

John Biggs is one of the members upset by the posters. He said: 'Channel 4 should show greater 
respect and restraint.'

Travellers say the latest series portrays young gypsy men as 'menacing' and have complained to Channel 4

He wrote to the broadcaster with 
Jennette Arnold, who is also a member of the assembly, saying the adverts
were 'totally inappropriate, offensive and disrespectful' and raised concerns that theyÂ would cause more 'ill feeling and discrimination'.

Meanwhile, the London Travellers' Unit questioned whether the broadcaster would consider it appropriate to use words and phrases like 
'Blacker' or 'more Asian' to describe other ethnic groups, the Daily 
Telegraph said.

The unit has called on Channel 4 to remove the posters and apologise.

Complaints have also been lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority.

Meanwhile, travellers said they have been upset by the show and have found it 'insulting and degrading'.

The documentary makers have also been accused of portraying traveller men as 'menacing'.

It follows the conviction last month of the cousin of Big Fat Gypsy star Paddy Doherty.

Johnny Joyce, 21, bit off the ear of the Celebrity Big Brother winner in a bare-knuckle street brawl in Manchester.

The fight between Joyce and 52-year-old Doherty was filmed on a mobile phone and loaded to YouTube, showing the blood-splattered reality TV star grappling with his cousin in front of rush-hour traffic.

The popular documentary returned to screens on Tuesday with 4.8million viewers and picked up a further 858,000 on its time-shift channel, taking its combined total to 5.7million.

It follows young gypsy couples in the run-up to their weddings and is notable for showcasing brides' extraordinarily extravagant wedding dresses and the provocative outfits of their teenage wedding guests.

Tuesday's show followed Irish traveller Dolores in the run-up to her wedding day. The design of her gown was described as the most 
'outrageous design yet' by Thelma Madine - the dressmaker who has 
featured on the show since the beginning.

This week's programme also featured teenage girls competing in skimpy outfits in a beauty contest

The show also showed teenage traveller girls competing in a beauty contest.

The programme's aim is to promote another side to travellers in Britain and the Republic of Ireland who claim they are victims of prejudice.

Channel 4 told the newspaper 'gypsier' reflected the 'greater access and insight' into the gypsy communities and said the words were not used in a negative context.

The spokesman said the advertising campaign was designed to build on the celebratory nature of the first series.
