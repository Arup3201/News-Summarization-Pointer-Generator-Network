The toyboy fiance of Denise Welch has today been cleared of carrying out an alleged £12,000 fraud.

Lincoln Townley, 39, was accused of brokering a deal under a fake name to supply FM Conway Ltd with a fleet of vans in 2009 through his firm Master Fleet.

It was alleged he cheated the engineering firm out of £12,164 before fleeing to the sun-drenched island of Majorca.

Prosecutors had claimed that Townley, who is 15 years younger than Loose Women panelist Ms Welch, struck the deal under the alias David Green because ‘right from the start Mr Townley was not conducting a genuine transaction’.

Townley admitted he had not supplied the vehicles and that he had travelled to Majorca shortly after the deal collapsed.

But he said he had no intention to defraud Kent-based FM Conway and had attempted to return the money when he flew back to the UK.

He said he had employed Green as a contractor to generate business for his firm but had lost contact with him when he jetted out to Majorca.

Today, after just over four hours of deliberation, a jury at Southwark Crown Court cleared Townley of fraud.

Speaking outside court, where he hugged his barrister and supporters, he said: ‘I’m just very happy with the outcome’.

Asked how he planned to celebrate he said: ‘I’m going out with Denise and the family’.

Prosecutor Daniel Bunting alleged Townley negotiated with FM Conway ‘in order to get the deposit but he never intended to supply the services to them’.

Townley, however, told the court Green had agreed the deal with the firm while he worked on sourcing vehicles from hire company Leaseway.

He accepted that the vehicles were never provided saying his deal with Leaseway had collapsed.

‘The communication there was very poor,’ he said.

‘I was in a lot of distress and FM Conway were telling me they wanted the vehicles very quickly.

‘I was under pressure, Leaseway were telling me I need to wait longer for the vehicles and the deal just fell flat.

‘I found it very hard to cope with this.

‘It started to create a lot of pressure for me mentally and I had a breakdown over it.

‘At the time I regrettably spoke to some friends out in Majorca and I went out to see them at the end of August for a week.

‘I went to my doctor about this I was suffering with anxiety and depression and to be honest I was drinking too much at the time. It got too much for me.’

He said that when he returned from Majorca he contacted Ian Gay at FM Conway.

‘It was a complete nightmare,’ he said.

‘He showed no empathy with regards to me wanting to give him a repayment schedule.’

Welch and party organiser Townley met in April 2011, while her now estranged Tim Healy was having an affair with current girlfriend Joan Anderton.

The couple announced their 23 year marriage had broken down in February this year, with Denise going public with Townley the following month, before getting engaged in August.

According to its website Lincoln Townley Entertainment is a ‘boutique agency’ providing PR and publicity services for a ‘select number of high-end London businesses and celebrity clients’.

It also claims the firm host some of ‘the most incredible parties for an exclusive clientele of high-net worth individuals, celebrities and leading brands in the world of art, high performance cars, luxury goods and fashion’.

Townley, of Kentish Town, north London, denied one count of fraud between July 1 and August 31, 2009.
