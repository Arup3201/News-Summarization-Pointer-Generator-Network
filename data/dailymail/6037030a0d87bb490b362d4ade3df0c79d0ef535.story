A second British national from Coventry has been reportedly killed fighting for Islamic State. 

Rashid Amani, 19, had been fighting for Islamic State in the besieged Syrian town of Kobane when he suffered serious wounds from a US air strike.

Amani travelled with his fellow school friends, Mohammed Hadi and Ali Kalantar from his home in Coventry to Syria in March of this year. 

Kalantar, 18, was reportedly killed by a French air strike during an ISIS offensive on Tikrit University in Iraq. Hadi, also known as Abu Yahya al-Kurdi, is the only one of the Coventry trio is still alive.

News of Amani's apparent death was revealed by a British Algerian fighter on Twitter.

Abu Musab al-Jazairi, who appears to have been a close friend of the two deceased Coventry boys, posted a photo of Rashid Amani and declared him to be a martyr.

Amani, known by his nom de guerre 'Abu Massoud al-Khurassani' or 'Abu Bakr al-Khurassani, 'appears smiling in the photo, wearing camouflage military fatigues with his index finger raised.

Abu Musab also posted a photo of the final clothes wore by Kalantar before he went to his death.

The caption reads, 'My brother Ali al-Farsi's last outfit he wore before going to Iraq and getting his shahada [martyrdom]. Al-hamdullilah [praise be to God], passed on to me.'

Amani grew up in Coventry and attended Coventry's Barr Hill's School and Community College with Ali Kalantar. The pair were both of Afghan origin.

It is unclear whether Hadi attended the same school but he was said to be good friends with the two teenagers. Hadi, who is of Kurdish descent and speaks fluent Arabic, Kurdish and moderate Somali, chose to leave his two friends and fight separately in Iraq after joining the Islamic State.

Prior to leaving for Syria, Amani had been studying Business at Coventry University.

Kalantar had been taking his A Levels and also planned to study at Coventry University, hoping to study Computer Science.

Amani's father, Khabir, revealed in a BBC interview, that family members had actively tried to bring him back from Syria.

Family members had travelled to the Syria-Turkey border but were unable to reach him.

The wife of Ali Kalantar (right) is said to be Zahra Halane (left), one of the so-called 'terror twins' who left Manchester in June this year to join fight in Syria 

In the same interview, Kalantar's father told BBC Pashto that he believed Ali and his two friends had been 'sent down this road' by a radical local imam.

Initially it was believed that Amani was married to Salman Halane, one of the 'terror twins', whose sister had married Amani's friend, Ali Kalantar. However, it is now known that Amani simply lived with Kalantar and Halane in a house in the Syrian town of Manbej.

Whilst in Syria, Kalantar repeatedly appeared more radical on social media, vowing that he was going to burn in British passport as a sign of his disdain for his previous Western life. 

He wrote on his Facebook page: 'Just to proof [sic] how much I want to come back to US, soon you would see a video of me burning my passport which has less value then my toilet tissue paper'.
