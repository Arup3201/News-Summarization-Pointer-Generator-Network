While the rest of the sporting world will be tucking into turkeys and families will be unwrapping gifts, Christmas Day will be just another day at work for the best basketball players in the world.

The NBA will once again serve up an action-packed festive feast on Christmas Day with five marquee match-ups set to take place in one of the highlights of the basketball calendar.

There's plenty to look forward to as well with an early start at Madison Square Garden, LeBron James returning to his former team Miami and a rematch of the Western Conference Finals between San Antonio and Oklahoma City.

But all that is just the early part of the day. Late on Christmas night, Kobe Bryant will lead his Los Angeles Lakers into Chicago and there is a tasty treat to end the day when the Golden State Warriors visit the Los Angeles Clippers.

Here is our preview of Thursday's basketball feast, which begins at 5pm UK time.

The NBA will be in full swing on Christmas Day with five games on back-to-back throughout the day

LEBRON RETURNS TO MIAMI

The best player in the world returns to south Florida and to the team he led to back-to-back NBA titles. James departed Miami in the summer to return home to Ohio and the Cleveland Cavaliers, and his former fans on South Beach will get their first chance to see him in action since he left.

On the other side will be Luol Deng, the British star who made a name for himself in his decade with the Chicago Bulls and is now looking to lead the new-look Heat in life after LeBron.

'At first it was a strange feeling playing on Christmas Day but now I’ve gotten used to it. I really like how the NBA has made it a real family festive day where people come out to arena’s all over the US to support the league. It’s something I really enjoy being a part of.

'I haven’t spent Christmas Day in London for so long, I’ve got used to all my family being with me in the US. I remember how brilliant London looks at this time of year. It always has so many Christmas decorations and lights which was really cool to see!'

The Cavaliers travel to Florida hot on the heels of the Chicago Bulls in the Central Division and seeded fifth as things stand in the Eastern Conference. 

After some teething problems early on while trying to bed in new signings James and Kevin Love with point guard Kyrie Irving, Cleveland are beginning to emerge as a force in the East and will be one of the leading contenders come play-off time.

In Miami, the Heat have made a steady start to the season and currently occupy a low play-off position but they are below 500 this season and will want to improve on that. Can Deng team up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to stop the Cavs on Christmas?

Christmas Day games have been a tradition in the NBA dating all the way back to the 1940s in the league's early years.

The games provide some marquee match-ups featuring the best players and teams in the league. 

It is also the first time in the season that NBA games are screened on free-to-air national television in the United States.

WEST COAST SHOWDOWN

The Golden State Warriors have been the best team in the league in the first part of this season, going on a 16-game winning streak that saw them surge to the top of the Western Conference standings.

Steph Curry and Co have lit up the league and look like the team to beat in a Western Conference that is always extremely competitive.

But it will be no Christmas walkover for the Warriors and they had better come out to play at the Staples Center when they face the Los Angeles Clippers.

The Clippers are leading the chase of the Warriors in the Pacific Division and the likes of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin will be hoping to close in on their rivals with a big win on Thursday night.

To mark the occasion of Christmas Day, special edition jerseys are designed by the NBA. This season's shirts feature first names on the back as opposed to surnames.

WESTERN CONFERENCE RIVALS RESUME BATTLE

This season has been far from easy for the San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder, and the Western Conference rivals will be looking to get one over each other on Thursday. 

The Spurs beat the Thunder in a thrilling Western Conference Finals last year, avenging their defeat at the same stage of the play-offs in 2012.

The Thunder are on the road to recovery having been without their two superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook for a large part of the last few months through injury, but they still have a long way to go to make the play-offs.

San Antonio, meanwhile, have been without the likes of Tiago Splitter and Patty Mills while Tony Parker, Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard have also had their problems with injury and the need for a rest.

Both teams are battered and bruised, but that will only serve to make Thursday's game even more important and exciting.

HIGH-FLYING BULLS TACKLE KOBE'S LAKERS 

Kobe Bryant will head to Chicago for the first time since passing Bulls legend Michael Jordan into third place on the all-time scoring list. Bryant is often likened to Jordan, who is widely regarded as the greatest player to ever play the game, and he will be looking to make a statement against the team with whom MJ enjoyed so much success.

The Bulls find themselves well placed in the Eastern Conference with a top-four seeding, and Derrick Rose finally looks to be over the injury problems that have plagued him over the last two seasons and also the start of this campaign.

Given the strength of the Western Conference, the Lakers are already at the stage where they will need a miracle to reach the play-offs. But Kobe will be motivated to lead his side to a win with the eyes of a nation watching after they've tucked into their turkeys.

WIZARDS LOOK TO CAST A SPELL AT THE GARDEN 

The day's action begins at Madison Square Garden when the Washington Wizards make the short trip north to take on the New York Knicks.

The Big Apple is far from a happy place at the moment with the team in all sorts of trouble. Only the Philadelphia 76ers have been worse than the Knicks this season, leading to criticism of new coach Derek Fisher.

But the Knicks, who head to London to take on the Milwaukee Bucks in January, would like nothing more than a win to lift the gloom at the Garden.

It will be no easy feat, though, against a Washington team that is hot on the heels of Toronto and Atlanta at the top of the Eastern Conference standings.
