Premier League matches will be staged abroad within two years, Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins has claimed.

The move has been discussed by Premier League chairmen at their most recent meeting but no firm plans have been drawn up.

Club chairmen believe they could cash in on interest overseas - Manchester United have drawn huge crowds on their tours of the United States and the Far East - but plans for a 39th game were dropped in 2008 following widespread opposition, including from FIFA and UEFA.

Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins believes overseas Premier League game are inevitable

Jenkins, speaking at a fans' forum with his comments reported on www.walesonline.co.uk, said: 'I think it is inevitable it is going to happen.

'While we may not be 100 per cent about it, as passionate football supporters just watching football as we have, it's going to be a big change.

'The other side of that is we have got to make sure we are on the bandwagon with them or we are going to get left behind otherwise.

'There's definitely going to be a run of games played abroad in 12 months or two years.

'Whatever happens with the changes in the Premier League, we have got to be finishing high enough to be part of it.

'That's where it's going to be and where the money is.

'It's a sad reflection of where football is but unless we are part of that, it's inevitable we are going to fall behind.

'We have got to make sure, whether we like it or not, we are on board with it.'

The Premier League is not alone in looking to hold games abroad - Italy's Serie A chief confirmed on Tuesday that the Italian Super Cup clash between Juventus and Napoli will be played in Doha, Qatar on December 22, while the French Super Cup clash has taken place away from France for the last six years.
