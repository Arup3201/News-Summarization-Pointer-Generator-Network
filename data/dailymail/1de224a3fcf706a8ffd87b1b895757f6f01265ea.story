A family won't have trouble remembering their children's birthdays - because all four siblings were born on the same day.

Emily Scrugham and Peter Dunn were amazed when their newborn son arrived on January 12, the exact same date as his three elder brother and sisters.

New baby Ryan shares his birthday with his five-year-old brother Sam, and his two-year-old twin sisters Brooke and Nicole.

The couple from Cleator Moor, Cumbria, beat odds of a staggering 1/133225 in producing a quadruple birthday for their four children.

Emily, 22, said: 'I really can't believe we have another birthday on the same day - it certainly wasn't planned.

'None of the births were due on January 12. Sam was two weeks late, the twins one month early and Ryan three days late.

'The twins had to be delivered by emergency caesarean section as doctors couldn't find their heartbeats. I didn't want them to be born on his birthday but I didn't have a choice.

'And this time round, I went into labour 9pm on Saturday night [January 11] and Ryan appeared at 3am, meaning we now have an extra special little family.'

The couple who have been together for seven years and met through mutual friends, say having four children all born on the same day is just a lucky coincidence.

Peter, 24, said: 'I'm still trying to work out if it would be easier to have birthdays spread throughout the year or all on the same day.

'It doesn't matter though - we plan to make every birthday a real family event where birthdays get celebrated individually and together.'

This year, Sam had his own cake and Brooke and Nicole shared one while waiting for mum to come out of hospital.

Emily said she would never dream of moving their birthdays so they could have their own day to celebrate.

She said: 'They were all born on January 12 so it will be celebrated on that day.'

Further down the line, the couple will have to plan a 21st, an 18th and a 16th birthday party all for the same day.

Peter said: 'It will always be tough just after Christmas but we will shop for bits and bobs all year round to try and take some of the strain.'

The family said they are looking forward to the normal challenges and sleepless nights of having four children aged five and under.Â
