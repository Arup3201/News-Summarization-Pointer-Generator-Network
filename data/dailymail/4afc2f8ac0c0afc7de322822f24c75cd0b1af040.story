Nepal will issue passports for three genders, with a third option for people who feel they are neither male or female. 

The long-awaited move follows a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2007 that recognised a third gender. 

It is a further sign the Himalayan nation is becoming more liberal following the end of a decade-long civil war in 2006.

Nepal will issue passports for three genders with an option for people who feel they're neither male or female

Lok Bahadur Thapa, chief of the government’s passport department, said: 'We have changed the passport regulations and will add a third category of gender for those people who do not want to be identified as male or female.'

Nepal joins Australia and New Zealand in recognising a third gender. 

Citizens will now have the chance to choose between three genders - male, female or indeterminate, marked by an 'x' in the passport.

It is hoped the change will help combat widespread discrimination against the country's sexual minorities. 

Pinky Gurung, chief of the Blue Diamond Society, a leading gay rights group, said: 'It is a very progressive move and we welcome it.'  

He also called on authorities to amend existing legislation - such as inheritance laws - to recognise the third gender.

Nepal emerged from a decade of conflict between government forces and Maoist rebels in 2006. 

The aim of the civil war was to overthrow the Nepalese monarchy and establish a 'People's Republic'.

After the end of the war - which saw the end of the 239-year-old Nepalese monarchy and a constituent assembly election held - the country started to acknowledge the rights of the LGBT community.

Since then, same-sex marriages have taken place in public (although they are still unrecognised in law) and gay pride parades and beauty contests have been held in the capital Kathmandu.

Despite that, gay sex remains illegal with a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment, and gay rights activists say the LGBT community continues to face discrimination.

The country is preparing its first constitution after the abolition of the monarchy.

The LGBT community hopes that the charter - expected to be drawn up this month - will ensure greater rights to minority groups.

Elsewhere, India' Supreme Court recognised the third gender last year. This will apply to all identity documents, including a birth certificate, passport and driving licence.
