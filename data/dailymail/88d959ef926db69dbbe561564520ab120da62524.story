A ten-year-old girl died following an epileptic fit in her sleep, after doctors 'missed opportunities' to diagnose her with the condition, an inquest heard.

Dena Hale was found cold and unresponsive by her mother Debbie on the morning of March 3, 2011.

Despite her frantic father performing CPR and the efforts of paramedics who attended the family home in Normanton, West Yorkshire, Dena was pronounced dead at nearby Pinderfields Hospital that morning.

Dena Hale had shown symptoms of likely neurological problems in the form of epilepsy before her death

The Wakefield inquest heard that Dena had been to her GP surgery with slurred speech and pins and needles in August 2009 - where she was seen by a locum doctor.

The locum doctor had written in her notes that he thought she had been dehydrated, adding 'refer to specialist' - but this referral never happened, something which coroner David Hinchliff called a 'missed opportunity” to diagnose her.

Her regular GP at the Newland surgery, Dr Ram Prasad Gupta, was also unable to understand a memo the locum had written on Dena’s notes - ‘CSOS’ - which another doctor had to translate as ‘See in an emergency’.

Speaking through their representative Mr Oliver Longstaff, Dena’s mother and father Stephen asked the GP why the locum’s notes had not been followed up.

Mr Longstaff asked Dr Gupta: 'From his notes, do you believe the locum should do the referral or you?'

To which the GP answered: 'He should.'

Mr Longstaff asked: 'So if there was a suggestion that there should be a referral that was never followed up? And if he doesn’t then the suggestion just gets lost in the system?'

Dr Gupta said: 'Yes.'

But coroner Hinchliff also noted that Dena had been seen by a specialist after visiting the A&E in January 2010 when her parents said she had suffered a fit - but even after this she had not been diagnosed with epilepsy or put on any medication.

He noted that she had been given a wake EEG (electroencephalogram), which is used to pick up electrical activity in the brain, but not a sleep EEG.And when she was reviewed in a surgery a year later, it was found that she had not had any more episodes.

Prof Judith Cross, an expert witness, said she thought Dena could have been suffering from Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes, which occurs in children after the age of five and usually stops when they reach 14, and presents itself with pins and needles and trouble speaking, and in the majority occurs in sleep.

Prof Cross also explained that if Dena had been diagnosed with the epilepsy, there would have then been a discussion with the family about whether or not to place her on treatment.

In her opinion, this would have been of comfort to the family.

Asked by the coroner whether the GP should have referred Dena to a specialist after she visited in August 2009, Prof Cross said yes, but she also agreed with the statement that GPs were not specialists and could not be expected to know every symptom of every condition.

A post-mortem examination found teeth marks on Dena’s lip and tongue, which pathologist Dr Mudher Al-Adnani noted was consistent with an epileptic fit, but added that there are few other signs after someone has suffered a fit.

Recording a verdict of death by natural causes caused by sudden and unexplained death in epilepsy, Coroner Hinchliff said: 'I’m very conscious that Dena has showed symptoms of likely neurological problems in the form of epilepsy.

Dena was declared dead at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield in March 2011

'She was seen by her GP on more than one occasion I think that there were indications there that would have been appropriate for her to be referred to the appropriate clinicians with expertise both in paediatrics and epilepsy for her to have been reviewed and followed up.

'Had that been the case then based on the fact that there were at least two events that were suggestive of some epileptic activity some diagnosis could have been made.

'Then, assuming this, there would have been a discussion about treatment and options.

'Whether that would have been putting Dena on some kind of medication would have been discussed.

'I strongly suspect that Dena’s parents would have had reassurance if there had been a positive diagnosis, and been a discussion of options.

'As part of that a sleep EEG should have been performed. Whether that would have been diagnostically helpful can only be guessed. I’m troubled by the records of the GP, in particular when the locum doctor has made reference to a referral that did not happen. I would regard that as a missed opportunity.'

But he added: 'Bearing in mind even if Dena had had the review and even if she had been prescribed medication it wouldn’t necessarily have meant that should would have been saved.

'The medication and treatment helps to alleviate the symptoms, it doesn’t cure them.'

Speaking after the inquest, Dena’s mother Debbie, 37, said: 'We’ve been through hell since Dena died and we’re still going through it.

'Dena was a lovely, friendly girl who lit up a room when she walked into it. If she saw anyone upset she wanted to make it better.

'The coroner talked about missed opportunities but the biggest missed opportunity is Dena’s missed opportunities - she should have been at high school now, playing with her friends, spending time with her family.

'We tried so many times to get answers - but no-one would listen to us.'

Teacher Debbie, who is married to 59-year-old Stephen, a driving instructor, added: 'The inquest hasn’t answered many of our questions; it’s just given up lots more.'

A statement issued on behalf of the family added: 'Further questions now arise as to the impact of the ‘missed opportunities’ and whether Dena would still be alive if appropriate action had been taken.'

Switalskis Solicitors also confirmed that the family will be pursuing a claim for medical negligence in respect of the treatment received by Dena concerning her undiagnosed epileptic condition.
