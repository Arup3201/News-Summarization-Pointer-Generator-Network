Voters still blame Labour for the need to cut public spending, three and a half years after the party was dumped from power, new research reveals.

In a blow for Ed Miliband’s strategy of attacking the coalition’s austerity programme, more than one in three people say the cuts are his party’s fault as it continues to be haunted by the infamous note left in the Treasury admitting 'there is no money'.

A state of the nation study released with barely a year and half before the next election also shows 31 per cent of people think the Tories will handle the economy best.

The study by pollsters YouGov examines public opinion since the general election in 2010 and looks ahead to the big issues for the 2015 polling day.

It shows that the economy remains the major political battleground, with 67 per cent naming it as the most important issue facing the country.

However, only a minority of voters persuaded by Mr Miliband’s attacks on the current government,

YouGov says the party battle over the economy is a contest between two narratives: ‘the tough decisions have been taken and now the economy is on the mend’ versus ‘living standards have fallen since 2010 and, for most people, show no signs of reviving’.

David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg have struck a more upbeat tone in recent days about the recovery gaining momentum.

Chancellor Mr Osborne said the economy was 'turning a corner' while Mr Clegg 'a dawn appears to be breaking'.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney told MPs today: 'Our job is to make sure that that's not another false dawn, and ensure that this economy reaches, as soon as possible, a speed of escape velocity, so that it can sustain higher interest rates.'

Just over half of people (53 per cent) claim immigration is the most important issue, followed by 30 per cent for welfare, 29 per cent who said health and 17 per cent said housing.

Since the election in 2010, the proportion of people who blame Labour for spending cuts has fallen from 48 per cent to 36 per cent.

But it is still well above the 25 per cent who blame the coalition, which has only risen slightly since the 17 per cent when the government was first formed.

When Labour lost power in 2010, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liam Byrne wrote a note to his successor, David Laws, admitting: 'I'm afraid there is no money.'

Labour have struggled to live the blunt admission down, even three and a half years later.

Since the start of this year, the Tories have gradually built their lead over Labour on the economy.

The Conservatives are considered ‘best to handle the economy’ by 31 per cent of people, compared with 25 per cent who said Labour and just four per cent who named the Lib Dems.

However, with the economic recovery still in its early stages, one in five (21 per cent) said they ‘don’t know’ who is best placed to be put in charge of the nation’s finances.

Despite the poor economic reputation, Labour remains ahead in the polls for who people would vote for at the election on 38 per cent, with Tories on 32 per cent.

YouGov said: ‘Labour’s 6 per cent lead is enough to make Ed Miliband Prime Minister – but may not be enough for him to lead a majority Government.

‘When we take all factors into account, including the incumbency “bonus” likely to be enjoyed by Conservative MPs newly elected in 2010, Labour and the Conservatives both need around a 7 per cent lead in order to secure an overall majority in 2015.’
