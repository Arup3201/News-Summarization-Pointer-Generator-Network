Liverpool starlet Jerome Sinclair has revealed that Kop 'legend' Robbie Fowler is having a massive influence on his development.

Sinclair, 18, became Liverpool's youngest ever player when he made his debut against West Brom in a League Cup tie in September 2012.

Injuries have hampered his development since but this season Sinclair has bounced back with 21 goals in all competitions for Liverpool's youth teams.

'He has given me a few little tips on my first touch, and worked with me on different types of finishing. He is always there to help me in any way he can.'

Fowler, now 39, had two spells at Anfield; from 1993 to 2001 before returning for 18 months in January 2006. He scored 183 goals in 368 games for the club.
