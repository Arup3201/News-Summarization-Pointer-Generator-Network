England goalkeeper Joe Hart has promised his 'hungry' team-mates will not surrender their Premier League title without a fight ahead of Sunday's trip to Anfield.

City are aiming to bounce back from a disappointing Champions League defeat against Barcelona on Tuesday but can close the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to two points by beating Liverpool at lunchtime, with Jose Mourinho's men occupied in the Capital One Cup final.

Hart has already won two championship medals with City but says it has done nothing to dampen his desire to collect more despite Chelsea being odds-on favourites to claim the crown in May.

Joe Hart is in excellent form and hoping to help Manchester City to defend their Premier League title

Hart rushes out to deny Lionel Messi during the 2-1 Champions League defeat to Barcelona in midweek 

'Chelsea are performing well this season but there are plenty of twists and turns to come. Last weekend (when Chelsea and Burnley drew 1-1) proved that.

'We have had results like that too and it's a damn hard league to win. That's why we are so proud of the two we've won so far and why we want three, four, five.

'People write you off but we have proved them wrong before and we will do it in the Premier League. We are 100% fit with an amazing squad, look at the quality we have in our squad. We are in the right place it's now down to us.

Hart saved a crucial penalty to keep City in the tie, and is now turning his attention back to the league

Chelsea dropped points against Burnley last week, and City can further close the gap on Sunday

'We won't give in, we are here to win and that's all we want to do. It is what we believe in together and we are hungry to try to do that.'

Hart has had an outstanding season and signed a new long-term contract after losing his place to Willie Caballero early on. He accepts criticism as part of the job at City and is quick to defend manager Manuel Pellegrini, whose tactics were questioned against Barcelona.

'That's life being at Manchester City. I let a goal in and I'm under pressure. We miss chances and we don't score the lads are under pressure,' he said.

Hart believes City have enough quality in their squad to defend the title which they won last May

'But that's why we are at this club. We aren't here to hide. The manager doesn't want to be manager of this club so he can hide. He fronts it up.

'He has been a great manager for us and will continue to try and win things with us and we want to win things with him.'
