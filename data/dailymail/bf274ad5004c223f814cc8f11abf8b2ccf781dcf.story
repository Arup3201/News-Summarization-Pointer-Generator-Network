Michael Jackson's former private doctor is being sued by a female patient who claims he sexually assaulted her during an examination.

Dr Allan Metzger, who testified at the manslaughter trial of the late pop star's other physician Conrad Murray, is accused of groping the woman's breasts during a check-up last year.

In a lawsuit filed at the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Victoria Oliver claims he described her body during one exam as 'delicious'.

'Groped patient': Michael Jackson's former doctor Allan Metzger (pictured here giving evidence in the manslaughter trial of Conrad Murray) has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman during a check-up

In another, she claims Metzger placed his hands under her blouse. When she protested, she alleges he responded by saying: 'Why don't we close the door and really have some fun.'

Oliver claims the doctor then snuck around behind her and groped her breasts from behind while pressing himself against her body.

Oliver is suing for unspecified damages, saying she felt humiliated and still suffers emotional distress, it was reported on TMZ.com.

Metzger has not yet responded to a request for comment.

Metzger treated Jackson earlier in his career and even videotaped the singer's wedding to Debbie Rowe.

He also met with Jackson once in the months before he died.

Accused: Metzger, pictured with his grandson Kailen and Jackson in 2003, says he treated the pop star for 15 years and told during the Murray trial how he refused to give the singer hospital anaethestic to help him sleep

Defense attorneys for Murray, who was convicted of killing the superstar, called him as a witness in the trial to try to show the singer was attempting to obtain a powerful anesthetic for home use.

But despite being a defense witness, Metzger aided prosecutors by telling jurors that he refused Jackson's request and warned him of the risks.

During the trial in October 2011, Metzger claimed to have treated Jackson for between 15 and 20 years and told how he refused the singer's pleas to administer hospital anaesthetic so he could sleep.

He said he'd treated Jackson over the years for anxiety and sleep disorders.

'Sleep was the issue, particularly after performing. He could not come down,' said Metzger during the case.

He said Jackson asked him for 'intravenous sleep medicine' in April 2009.

'I think he used the word "juiced",' he said. 'He didn't believe that any oral medicine would be helpful. He wanted some form of anaesthetic.'

The doctor told the jury at Los Angeles Superior Court that no amount of money would have persuaded him to grant the singer's request.

Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for causing Jackson's death at the age of 50 by giving him a lethal dose of the sedative Propofol.
