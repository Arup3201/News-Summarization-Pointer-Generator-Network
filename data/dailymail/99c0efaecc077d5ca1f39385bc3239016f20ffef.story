The victim of a former NYPD officer who sexually assaulted her at gunpoint told a court today how her life had been 'shattered' by the attack. 

Michael Pena, 28, was jailed for life after he dragged the 24-year-old teacher into an alley last August and abused her at gunpoint.

The young woman wept in the front row of
the Manhattan courtroom when the judge said Pena must 
serve at least 75 years without parole for the assault in the Bronx.

Guilty: Disgraced NYPD cop Michael Pena was given a life sentence for the rape of a school teacher at gun point in the Bronx

Before Pena was sentenced, the woman, now 25, read a victim impact statement to the court.

She expressed her anger that the jury had only found the former police officer guilty of sexual assault and not of raping her.

She said: 'That day was supposed to be a new beginning for me. My life has been shattered.

'This has impacted every single aspect of my life. He used his weapon and basically destructed my life with the choice he made that day.'

The teacher had been on her way to teach the second-grade in the Bronx when Pena pulled her into an alley while pointing his service weapon and repeatedly threatened to 'blow her f****** face off'.

He was implicated by the DNA he left on the woman's clothing and after a 
futile, early claim that the sex was consensual, he admitted he 
attacked her.

Pena had also claimed that he did not actually penetrate the woman.

According to the New York 
Post, Pena told authorities that he was immediately remorseful for the 
attack and too drunk to control his actions.

He made a last attempt for leniency to the court today and offered an apology for the 'incident'.

The victim had spoken earlier in the trial about her terror during the brutal violation by the off-duty cop.

‘Were your knees buckling? Were you 
trembling? Were you scared?"’ defence lawyer Ephraim Savitt asked the 
woman repeatedly on cross examination.

‘Petrified,’ she answered. ‘When I realized he had a gun, yes.’

Phone records revealed that hours 
before the attack, Pena trawled through XXX listings on Craigslist and 
flirted with two other women by text.
