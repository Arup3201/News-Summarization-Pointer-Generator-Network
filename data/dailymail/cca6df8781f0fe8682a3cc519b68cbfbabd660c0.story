Bob Geldof has attacked Australian political leaders for reneging on their promise to increase foreign aid, saying that they 'broke their word to the poorest people on the planet'.

Speaking at the AIDS 2014 Conference in Melbourne, Mr Geldof said that AIDS was a symptom of poverty and countries like Australia had an obligation to help the world's poor.

'Remember, you're one of the richest countries in the world, even though you have your problems and you feel the pinch,' he said.

Bob Geldof addressed the AIDS conference in Melbourne and criticised Australian leaders for breaking their commitment to increasing foreign aid

'The Australian government promised to increase ODA [Official Development Assistance, or foreign aid] to 0.5 percent [of Gross National Income],' he said.

'The Australian people gave their word to the poorest people on the planet. You can't break your sovereign word to the poorest people, it's like beating up an infant,' said Mr Geldof.

'You can't f*** around with your political promise.'

Mr Geldof was referencing the 2007 bipartisan commitment to increase Australia's foreign aid contribution to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2016-17.

In 2012, Labor announced the increase to 0.5 percent would be delayed by 12 months and in the most recent budget the Coalition slashed foreign aid funding, with 20 percent of all budget cuts coming from the foreign aid budget, despite it making up less than 1.3 percent of the entire budget.

Bob Geldof told the conference that AIDS was a symptom of poverty and that developed nations like Australia had an obligation to keep their promises to the poor

Mr Geldof named Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard in his address and said he was 'dismayed' that they had cut funding for foreign aid

At present Australia contributes approximately 0.35 percent of GNI (35Â¢ of every $100) to international aid.

This amount is half of the recommended contribution of developed nations to foreign aid in order to achieve the United Nations millennium development goals, which aim to halve the number of people living on less than $1 a day by 2015.

Mr Geldof also praised the AIDS researchers in the audience for the speed at which their work had progressed.

'[It's been] thirty years, from a new pandemic on the streets of New York, where AIDS was first noticed, to almost being able to terminate it. I don't mean to big you guys up but it's amazing, it's never been done before.'

Mr Geldof then condemned the 'preposterous reluctance to fund the last mile' of research, a comment that elicited applause from the audience.
