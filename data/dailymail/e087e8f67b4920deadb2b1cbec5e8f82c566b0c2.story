The police have seized a new £300,000 prize in their battle against uninsured drivers - and displayed it outside New Scotland Yard as a warning to others.

This Lamborghini Aventador can reach 62 mph in 2.9 seconds, but for now it is going nowhere after it was seized by Met Police in Soho.

The seizure was part of a police clampdown on uninsured drivers called Operation Cubo, which has so far claimed 37,000 uninsured vehicles from the roads since October last year.

Officers have the power to remove vehicles from the streets in order to improve road safety and stop motorists from committing vehicle crimes.

Although the identity of the Lamborghini owner has not been revealed, he can expect to pay a hefty fee for his vehicle's release as well as an additional charge per day.

With a 7-litre V12 engine, the Aventador is one of the fastest and most desirable cars in the world.

It can reach a top speed of 217mph and there are just 46 registered in the UK.

Over the past six weeks, the Met has seized more than 300 cars and this is the second super-desirable motor to be put on display.

An uninsured Ferrari FF owned by 
Sheikh Rashid Bin Humaid Al Nuaimi - son of the billionaire the Emir of Ajman - was also put on display, but has since been returned to him.

Ed Callow, who writes about cars on the website Torquespeak.com, passed the Lamborghini outside New Scotland Yard.

He
said: 'This is the second seized supercar the Met has put on show - it 
is a great way of showing that nobody is exempt from the regulations.'

A
Met Police statement said: 'A yellow Lamborghini Aventador, which was 
seized for having no valid insurance in Broadwick Street, Soho, as part 
of Operation Cubo at 1.15am on October 25 has been put in display 
outside New Scotland Yard to highlight the work to tackle uninsured drivers.'
