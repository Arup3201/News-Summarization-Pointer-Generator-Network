An adorable puppy Pit Bull named Cleo doesn't want to wake up from nap no matter how much her owner tries to rustle her from her sleep.

A clip of the cute pup in a dream state was posted on YouTube by RM Videos on November 5th and already has almost 200,000 views.

Cleo lays sprawled out on her back in an impenetrable slumber. Could she be dreaming of dog treats? Or baseballs? Her stern yet delicious expression makes it difficult to tell what's going on in her reveries.

'Cleeeoo,' says the dog's owner as she tries ticking her awake with her finger in various spots on her little body.

At one point she puts her finger in the dog's mouth. Cleo, who would have nothing of that, gives a little stretch but then turns  on her side and goes back to sleeping again.

Her owner tries lifting the dog’s paws and even puts her finger to giver the puppy a tickle but Cleo it seems, is a professional napper.

Dead asleep: Cleo the puppy is fast asleep on her back dreaming of dog treats and baseballs

No use trying: Cleo's owner gives her a nice belly rub but not even that is enough to wake her from sleep 

Doesn't bark or bite: When Cleo's owner put her fingers in the dog's mouth she doesn't bark or bite

Just a little stretch: Cleo the puppy stretches her arms and legs but her eyes remain closed 

Paws up: Even when Cleo's owner picks up her paws she doesn't budge from her impenetrable slumber 

Still snoozing: Cleo just stays on her side in a deep and blissful slumber for as long as she decides
