Payout: Former Blackberry manager Glen Hill, 54, has won a £400,000 payout from the mobile phone company

A Blackberry mobile phone manager who claimed he was left feeling suicidal after being bullied by his bosses has won a £400,000 payout.

Glen Hill, a former global strategic accounts manager who earned £88,000-a-year, claimed he was insulted before being subjected to 'long silences'.

The 54-year-old told his employment tribunal in Reading, Berkshire, that he suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of the abuse.

Mr Hill said he even rewrote his will as he was haunted by senior managers at the firm and wondered what life would be like for his son if he ended it all.

He said bosses ignored his pleas to move to another job within the firm and blocked him when he applied for vacancies.

The senior manager, from Richmond, Surrey, had initially been seeking £5.7million in loss of earnings he would have received if he had stayed with the company until he was 70.

Employment Judge John Warren ruled that Mr Hill was entitled to three years of his £88,000 annual salary plus a proportion of the annual bonuses he would have been received.

He was also granted £22,000 in compensation for injury caused to his feelings by Research In Motion who own Blackberry, £5,000 in aggravated damages and a further £21,000 car allowance.

A judgement on whether Blackberry must pay Mr Hill’s legal fees, which exceed £250,000, is yet to be made.

During the tribunal hearing in July 2012, the panel heard that Mr Hill was left waking up at night screaming, trembling with fear and over-eating.

The final straw came during a row over the salesman's weekly reports in May 2010. Mr Hill called a halt to the meeting after a barrage of shouting.

The following day he realised he was 'cracking up' and visited a doctor who advised him not to go back to work, beginning a long period of sickness.

During the remuneration hearing to decide his compensation last September, Mr Hill said that the seven-day employment hearing had been 'incredibly stressful' and at one point he genuinely believed he 'wouldn’t make it through'.

Worker: Mr Hill was employed by Research in Motion who make Blackberry phones. They have offices in Slough, Berkshire

During the hearing he said that he
 had been left with a mixture of 'incredulity and fear' after RIM, who have offices in Slough, Berkshire, had 
said it would love to see him back and would take good care of him.

'It is now three-and-a-half years since I last worked at RIM and it never needed to have been that way.

'All I ever asked of RIM was to move me away from the environment that was, in my opinion, abusive and damaging to my health.'

He explained that at the end of the first week of the original hearing his therapist, so concerned that he could not be reached, had the police break down his door.

A spokesman for Blackberry declined to comment today. Mr Hill could also not be reached for comment.
