A spell of extreme weather and plunging temperatures have transformed a viewing tower and pine trees into a series of striking ice sculptures. 

These dramatic photos capture the way the winter creations have transformed the landscape of the Dinaric Alps in Slovenia, into one resembling a scene from the hit Disney film, Frozen.

One tree frozen in high winds looks like a mythical dragon after being covered in a thick layer of ice, while the viewing tower, which looks over a forest, looks like the perfect escape for a snow queen.

The two-day ice storm that swept across the mountain range, which also spans areas of Croatia, Albania and Serbia, sent temperatures plummeting to below zero. The weight of the ice and snow was enough to topple some of the largest trees in the forest. 

The spectacular set of images were captured by photographer Marko Korosec, who specialises in shooting in extreme weather. 

In the smash-hit Disney film, the characters are forced to live in a land of snow after a magical queen accidentally sends her kingdom into a state of permanent winter.
