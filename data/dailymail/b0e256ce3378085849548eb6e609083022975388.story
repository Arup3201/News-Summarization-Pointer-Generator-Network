A yellow Ferrari bought by Elton John when he first became famous in 1972 has gone on sale for £300,000.

The Ferrari Dino 246GT, one of fewer than 500, belonged to the singer for six months before he gave it to longstanding drummer, Nigel Olsson. 

Having changed hands another five times since, it is expected to fetch £280,000 at a London auction at the end of the month.

The Ferrari 246GT was bought by Elton John in 1972 following the success of his single Crocodile Rock. It is being sold at auction in London and is expected to fetch £280,000 

The bright yellow car is one of just 498 original models supplied to the UK in right-hand configuration 

Sir Elton bought the flamboyant vehicle following the whirlwind success of his single, Crocodile Rock, in the early 1970s. 

He racked up 5,000 miles in the six months that he owned the car before handing it on to Mr Olsson in June 1973. 

It remained in the drummer's possession for a year before being sold to a private buyer.

In the 1990s the car broke down in Italy, and was forced to undergo a major overhaul. It now boasts a two-litre, four-cam V6 engine capable of powering it to speeds of almost 150mph.

After being sold four more times and clocking up 29,000 miles, it is being sold at Bonhams auction house on November 30.

'This car was one of only 498 Dino 246GTs supplied to the UK in right-hand drive configuration,' a spokesman for the auctioneers said.

The car will go under the hammer on November 30 at Bonhams  and is expected to fetch £280,000

'It was sold to Harold Webb Motors in Hornchurch, Essex, in February 1972 and first registered in their name on March 1 1972 as ‘SOO 25K’.

'In November 1972 the Dino was purchased by and registered to Elton Hercules John of Wentworth, Surrey.

'Apparently Elton gifted the car to his drummer, Nigel Olsson, as confirmed by a letter on file dated 15th June 1973 from John Reid, Sir Elton’s former manager.

'This letter states that ownership would be transferred ‘at a figure to be agreed’ and ‘on behalf of Elton John’.

'This car represents a rare opportunity to acquire a fully documented, low-mileage example of this iconic V6 Ferrari, possessing the additional cachet of A-List celebrity ownership.'
