Online fashion retailer ASOS has launched its first ever calendar, featuring 14 of our favourite male models from 2013.

The 'Boys 2014' calendar stars popular models like Ollie Loudon, Alex Libby and George Alsford in various states of undress as they stare cheekily into the camera.

Whether dressed in a bunny onesie, holding an unbelievably cute puppy, or simply posing in their boxer shorts, the ASOS boys show why they are some of the hottest up-and-coming talent on the British model scene.

Asos is known for using less conventional models including those with several tattoos like the rather sexy Billy and Sam

Alex could have just stepped off a surf board on a tropical beach with that glistening torso as he poses for June

Mikey goes commando (!) for November

All proceeds from the £8 calender will be donated to the ASOS Foundation, which is an independent charitable trust set up to provide young people with life-changing opportunities, support and inspiration through long-term partnerships with established charities.

As well as raising money for a good cause, the calendar hopes to build on the relationship ASOS likes to nurture between its customers and regular models with activity such as the weekly ‘Friday Fittie’ video which features a favourite ASOS model answering questions that customers have sent in via twitter.

We can't decide which one of these March pin ups we want to cuddle more...

Harvey turns up the heat for July with dangerous red Speedos

We would certainly be up for tennis, or basketball, or in fact any games if Tom and Will were our opponents

Jackson forgets his shirt as he celebrates the New Year for January. Shame.

Ollie shows off his creative side by posing with a guitar

Dom channels Brad Pitt in Thelma and Louise as he broods for the September shot
