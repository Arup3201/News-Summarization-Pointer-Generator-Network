Shadow warrior: 'Ninja' Neil Duffield strikes a pose in the Seaworld car park, where armed police pounced with Tasers after someone dialled 999

When Neil Duffield found out his work was to hold a superhero fun day, he decided it would be a great chance to dress up as that classic villain of Japanese history - the ninja.

So, when the day came, he donned the shadow warriors' distinctive black apparel, face covered in the manner of the medieval assassins, strapped a plastic sword to his back, and hopped on his bike.

But as he pedalled the Southend, Essex seafront on his way to work at the Sealife Adventure Centre, a startled member of the public took fright and dialled 999.

It was then, as Mr Duffield entered the Sealife car park, that Essex Police's Armed Response Unit pounced. They ordered him to freeze, with 50,000 volt Taser stun guns pointed squarely at his chest.

Stunned Mr Duffield, of Southchurch Road, Southend, said: 'I was told to stay where I was.  I had no idea what was going on.

'I was then told to raise my hands and keep them in the air. By this time, I had a rough idea of what was going on because of my outfit.

'I just said "it’s a costume, it’s a toy" while I had my arms in the air. The officers were from the armed response unit, they had tasers. I just stood still.

'I kept as calm as I possibly could but I was quite scared. It all happened really quickly.'

The officers frisked him and quickly discovered the sword was a plastic toy.

They then told Mr Duffield, who has worked at the centre for five years, to relax, explaining that a member of the public had alerted them to a suspicious character.

'They were just doing their job really,' said Mr Duffield, whose exploits have now earned him the moniker 'Ninja Neil' among colleagues.

'They told me to put my arms down and explained the situation. There were a few smiles afterwards.'

He added: 'I was told not to carry it in public again....So I guess I’m not going to be out on the streets fighting crime after all!'

Hi ya! Mr Duffield pounces with the ferocity of one of Japan's fabled assassin elite. But he wasn't so fierce when armed police had 50,000 volt Taser stun guns aimed at his chest

Mr Duffield said that instead of the deadly ninja throwing stars he was carrying starfish with him, which were due to go on display at nearby Adventure Island.

Sealife Adventure manager Lucy Hodges accepted police had done right thing. She added: 'Looking back it was quite amusing. The police were really nice.'

A police spokesman said: 'Officers were alerted just after 11am on Sunday to a man cycling on the seafront wearing a balaclava with a sword strapped to his back.

'They performed a low-key stop and after speaking to him realised the sword was plastic. He was taking part in a superhero themed weekend at Sealife Adventure.'
