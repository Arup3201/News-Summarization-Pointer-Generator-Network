A Queensland prison boss whose affair with a junior female colleague was sensationally outed on Facebook has quit his post following the scandal.

Andrew Pike, the General Manager of Stuart Prison in Townsville, resigned last week amid allegations he was involved in an affair with 23-year-old clerk Samantha Wallis, who works for Queensland Corrective Services with both Mr Pike and his wife.

Details of the jailhouse affair were publicised on Facebook by Ms Wallis' jilted ex-fiance Nick Billing, who said he 'wanted the world' to know about his former lover's secrete dalliance with Mr Pike.

It sparked a six-month investigation by Queensland Corrective Services, and follows a number of previous allegations into prison officers having sex with inmates and offers of sexual favours in return for money or drugs. There's no suggestion Mr Pike is involved with any other investigation.

Mr Billing wrote how his ex-lover was 'sleeping with her boss at Townsville Correctional Centre Andrew Pike for the last few months.'

He said while he usually wouldn't put a post of that nature on Facebook, this was perfect opportunity to out the pair.

A corrective services officer told the Courier Mail resigning was the former prison boss's only realistic option.

'It is not a good look when the boss man is caught with his pants down — let alone named and shamed on Facebook,' he said.

He said as the 'governor of the jail', a man who was in a position of 'authority and trust', he should have known better.

Queensland Corrective Services released a statement to which stated the investigation into Mr Pikes' conduct had now closed, following his resignation.

He has since taken up a managerial position with the Northern Territory prison system while Ms Wallis has kept hers.
