Dark days: Hugh Laurie as Dr Gregory House

He had one of the best jobs in Hollywood, picking up an estimated £250,000 an episode and a clutch of coveted TV awards along the way.

But it seems that Hugh Laurie was every bit as hard to please as his fictional alter-ego, the grumpy Dr Gregory House.

The British actor today sets out the full depth of the despair he felt while filming his hit TV series House.

Laurie, 53, says he found his filming commitments so bleak that he hoped to have an accident on the way to the studio just to earn a few days rest.

His starring role as Dr House made him one of the highest-paid TV actors of all time.

The U.S. drama, which finally ended last year after eight series, also won him two Golden Globe awards and six Emmy nominations.

But in an interview he says: ‘[It was] a gilded cage. At this distance it all sounds absurd.

Ridiculous. After all, what was I doing other than playing about, telling stories with a very nice bunchof people? What could be constricting about that? 

‘But the repetition of any routine, day after month after year, can turn into a bit of a nightmare.’

He adds: ‘I had some pretty bleak times, dark days when it seemed like there was no escape. And having a very Presbyterian work ethic, I was determined never to be late, not to miss a single day’s filming.

‘You wouldn’t catch me phoning in to say, “I think I may be coming down with the flu.”

But there were times when I’d think, “If I were just to have an accident on the way to the studio and win a couple of days off to recover, how brilliant would that be?”’ 

At its peak, House was watched by more than 18million viewers in the US and was syndicated around the world, including to Channel 5.

Laurie has two sons and a daughter with his wife, theatre administrator Jo Green, but spent nine months of every year apart from them while filming in Los Angeles.

He has complained before that the relentless filming schedule made him morose and revealed the strains of being away from his family.

The actor tells Radio Times that returning to the family home in north London had required adjustment. ‘[It was] difficult, yes, but probably more so for the family,’ he says. ‘For me it’s been a delight to be back with them.’
