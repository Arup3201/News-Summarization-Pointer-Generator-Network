With its hundreds of lights and blinking buttons, this is the pilot's-eye view from inside the cockpit of the space shuttle Endeavour as it prepares to make its last journey.

Workmen at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida's Cape Canaveral have been getting the vessel ready for when it goes on display by draining hazardous fuel, disconnecting or removing some systems and replacing the main engines with replicas.

Nasa's 30-year shuttle progamme ended last July with the voyage of Atlantis. Endeavour and Atlantis are to travel to the California Science Center in Los Angeles to go on display later this year.

Endeavour
landed at Kennedy Space Center last June,
bringing to an end the penultimate mission in the 30-year shuttle 
programme.

It touched down on the runway for the final
time under cover of darkness, just as Atlantis, the last shuttle bound 
for space, arrived at the launch pad for the grand finale.

Kelly, Vittori and Endeavour's 
four other astronauts - Gregory Johnson, Michael Fincke, Greg Chamitoff 
and Andrew Feustel - had returned to Earth after more than two weeks in 
space completing the U.S. share of repairs at the International Space 
Station.

After landing 
Endeavour in front of hundreds of onlookers that included the four 
Atlantis astronauts, Kelly said: 'It's sad to see her land for the last 
time, but she really has a great legacy.'

He even marvelled at how good Endeavour still looks, saying: 'It looks like it's ready to go do another mission.'

The last mission of Endeavour,
the youngest of the shuttles with 123million miles over 25 flights, lasted 16 days and completed Nasa's role in the space station 
construction effort that began more than a dozen years ago.

The crew - all experienced spacemen - departed the 220mile-high orbiting outpost.

They
installed a $2billion cosmic ray detector, an extension beam and a 
platform full of spare parts, enough to keep the station operating in 
the shuttle-less decade ahead.

Nasa is leaving the Earth-to-orbit business behind to focus on expeditions to asteroids and Mars.

Private
companies hope to pick up the slack for cargo and crew hauls to the 
space station. Until then, Americans will continue hitching rides to the
station aboard Russian Soyuz capsules at the cost of tens of millions 
of dollars a seat.

The 
official tally for Endeavour, after 19 years of flight, was 170 crew 
members, 299 days in space, 4,671 orbits of Earth and 122,883,151miles.
