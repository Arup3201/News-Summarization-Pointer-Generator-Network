Jay Z was viciously attacked by his wife Beyonce's sister Solange as the trio left the Met Gala after party in New York last Monday.

The 27-year-old was caught on surveillance camera lashing out wildly at her brother-in-law, 44, with both her arms and her legs, while her sister stood beside them looking curiously impassive. 

The famous family were in an elevator descending from a soiree that followed the annual fashion fest at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The aftermath: Jay Z looked shellshocked as the trio left the elevator after the fight at the Standard Hotel in New York last Monday

'What just happened?' Jay Z holds his face as Beyonce tries to plaster on a smile just minutes after the assault

The seemingly unprovoked attack plays out in footage obtained by TMZ.

Solange can clearly be seen kicking and swinging violently at Jay Z, the father of her two-year-old niece, Blue Ivy, after the trio step into the elevator.

Solange was screaming at her family member when the fight erupted and can be seen in the footage mouthing what appears to be a diatribe at the hip hop legend, according to TMZ sources.

In the footage, a man who looks to be a bodyguard tries to hold Solange back but she manages to rain blows on the rapper several times, and even hits him with her purse.

Trouble: Jay Z and Beyonce left in separate cars, the Sasha Fierce star departed with her sister

No remorse? Whatever Solange's problem with her brother-in-law was, it was still smouldering as she stormed off into the night followed by her sister

During the frenzied altercation, Jay Z grabs her stiletto clad foot to block a kick but never attempts to retaliate.

Beyonce seems sanguine throughout, and appears to be trying to calm her sister down.. . at one point she pragmatically removes the long train of her Givenchy Haute Couture dress from the fray.

The bodyguard can also be seen pushing the emergency stop button in the elevator at the 12th floor, no doubt stop the fight spilling out in front of photographers.

Ouch! Solange was going in for roundhouse kicks with these stiletto heels, Jay Z caught one with his hand

Shocked: Jay Z seemed to be in a daze as he was walked to the car

The face says it all: Bey tries to keep calm as her husband staggers behind

Jay Z's shocked appearance and hand to face as Solange marches angrily ahead after leaving the elevator were captured on film, however.

Beyonce tried to muster a showbiz smile as the threesome left but then tellingly departed with her sister in a car while her husband left separately.

It's not yet known what provoked the fight, however, the famous couple looked as happy as ever as they attended a Brooklyn Nets game on Saturday while Solange played a gig in New York.

While there still has been no word from either Beyonce or Jay Z's representatives, a spokesperson from The Standard Hotel in New York City has made a statement. Following calls regarding the leaked CCTV footage, reps for The Standard Hotel told MailOnline, they were 'shocked and disappointed' in what had been a 'clear breach of our security system'.

They said in a statement: 'We are investigating with the utmost urgency the circumstances surrounding the situation and, as is our customary practice, will discipline and prosecute the individuals involved to our fullest capacity.'

Rather tellingly, Jay Z had his arms affectionately around Solange's son who is known as Juelz, now nine, as the family sat courtside.

On Sunday, after the Webster Hall gig with M.I.A, Solange Tweeted: 'This might have been top 10 days ever in life.'

According to Radar, Jay Z and Beyonce 
seemed distant as they arrived at the Standard Hotel’s Boom Boom Room, a
 far cry from the adorable show they made of a schmaltzy proposal on the
 red carpet earlier at the Vogue party.

Struggling for composure: Jay Z rights himself as he tails his wife, who is also hot on the heels of her younger sister

Beyonce had dropped a ring and her husband was quick to hit the deck and retrieve it, before recreating the moment he asked her to become his wife.

That was a typically envy inducing show of togetherness, like Mr and Mrs Carter's performance at this year's Grammy Awards.

At the Standard, away from prying eyes, the couple sat at a table together deep in conversation before Beyonce peeled away to party with her sister and stars like Lupita Nyong'o.

According 
to Us Magazine, the trio seemed fine together, although Jay Z sat by a 
firepit while Beyonce and Solonge - clad in her peach Phillip Lim dress -
 danced with Naomi Campbell.

They did, however, leave 'abruptly' the magazine reports.

Both women seemed merry but weren't pictured holding alcohol.

Solange has admitted to issues with drugs in the past, and cancelled her European tour last year amidst rumours of usage... according to Radar Online.

In February, 2009, she tweeted about ending up in the hospital after a Nyquil overdose.

'I
 don’t even smoke weed that often, but I’m finding I can’t remember 
things,' she revealed on Twitter on Septemer 1 the same year.

United: Jay Z and Beyonce were the unit we've come to know and love over the last decade at the Met Gala, but the row with Solange saw them leave separately

Telling? Beyonce shared this prayer on Instagram five days ago, which made it just two days after the row

Solange 
and the music mogul have been close for over a decade, with Jay Z - real
 name Shawn Carter - taking a big brother style role to the fledgling 
star after he started dating her sister.

Beyonce and Jay Z were famously friends first but started a relationship way back in 2001, they then married in 2008.

Mrs
 Carter is extremely close to her younger sibling, and made a surprise 
appearance at Coachella this year to support Solange's set at the 
California music festival.

Back in 2008, she said: 'People think there should be this great rivalry between us, but there's never been any competition.

'There's a big age gap and we are two very different characters.

Business as usual: Jay Z and Beyonce looked fine as they enjoyed the Miami Heat/Brooklyn Nets game on Saturday

United as a family: Beyonce spent Saturday night with her husband instead of watching her sister perform across town but the pair took Solange's son Juelz, pictured with Jay Z, along with them

No cameo this time: As Beyonce enjoyed the basketball with Jay Z in Brooklyn, Solange performed at Webster Hall in New York with M.I.A

'I try to stand on my own two feet and not talk too much about my sister. But the two of us are still close.'

She even said when asked if Jay Z was an inspiration: 'I know. I have a lot of people to look up to and learn from.'

Always in 
Beyonce's shadow despite her own immense talent, Solange had a few 
stints in Destiny's Child, before signing with her father's Mathew's 
Music World Entertainment label; he and he girls' mother Tina had quit 
their jobs to focus on their eldest child's career.

But it 
paid off for Solange initially, too, as her her first studio album Solo 
Star - released when she was just 16 in 2003 - was a quiet success.

Just
 a year later, however, she married Daniel Smith, and after giving birth
 to their son Daniel Julez J. Smith Jr, moved to Idaho, where she occupied herself with writing 
music for her sister and ex Destiny's Child stars Kelly Rowland and 
Michelle Williams.

Close: Jay Z has been a big brother figure to Solange for over a decade, but their relationship seems to have soured

We are family: Jay Z and Beyonce welcomed a niece for Solange when Blue Ivy was born in January 2012

But she missed the buzz of performing herself and after divorcing Smith in 2007, Solange 
threw herself back into the fray moving to Los Angeles so she could begin to start recording her own material.

It paid off as her second album, Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, hit No. 9 on the Billboard 200 and garnered positive reviews.

She set up her own label, Saint Records, and recorded the album, True, in 2012 and has plans for a follow up later this year.

While no Beyonce, Solange is recognised as fashion icon and her Motown songwriting roots are respected throughout the industry.

Sister act: Beyonce joined Solange on stage at Coachella last month, the pair have always been close 

Before the divorce: Beyonce and Solange with parents Mathew and Tina in happier times 

The formerly solid family was rocked in 2009 when the girls' mother Tina filed for divorce from Mathew, who was then still Beyonce's manager, after it emerged he'd fathered a child during an extra-marital affair with Alexsandra Wright.

The Crazy in Love singer singer later ended her business relationship with her father, and neither sister attended his wedding to Gena Avery last year.

As a family unit, they've still remained strong it had seemed, with Solange mentioning frequently in interviews that her son Juelz and baby Blue are more like siblings than cousins.
