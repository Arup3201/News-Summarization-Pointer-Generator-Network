Argentina seemed completely unfazed by the prospect of facing Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria in their World Cup group as they laughed and joked around in training on Friday.

Lionel Messi and his teammates were in very high spirits as they were put through their paces by coach Alejandro Sabella at their camp near Belo Horizonte.

The Barcelona superstar looked relaxed despite the huge weight of expectation on his shoulders out in Brazil, showing off his ball juggling skills and laughing heartily as Javier Mascherano fell flat on his back during a passing drill.

His teammates Lucas Biglia, Sergio Aguero and Fernando Gago also saw the funny side as the Barcelona midfielder ended up on the ground while chasing the ball.

The training session was rather less eventful than Thursday's, when Brazil fans gathered at the Belo Horizonte Independencia stadium to jeer them and a Ronaldinho impersonator invaded the pitch.

Argentina, chasing their third World Cup title, boast arguably the strongest forward line in the tournament, with Messi, Aguero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Gonzalo Higuain scoring over a century of goals between them during the club season.

Sabella is likely to play either Lavezzi or Higuain in a three-man attack with Messi and Aguero when they take on Bosnia in the Maracana on Sunday night.

Meanwhile, Colombia coach Jose Pekerman has tipped Messi to make a return visit to the Maracana on July 13 and lift the World Cup trophy.

Pekerman, who handed Messi his debut when he was Argentina coach in 2005, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I brought Messi into the Argentina national team.

'I never doubted he was the rising star, I always dreamed he was going to be what he has become. Those first steps are unforgettable. Without doubt, he and the team can give Argentina another World Cup.'
