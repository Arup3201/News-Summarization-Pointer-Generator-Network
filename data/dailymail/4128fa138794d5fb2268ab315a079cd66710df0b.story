'On the east coast it will be really cold with a brisk wind. Across the South temperatures will be around 10C to 12C, quite a contrast to what we have seen over the last few weeks. But in the sunshine it could still get up to around 15C.

'Monday is still going to be unsettled compared to what we have see of late, with showers, but in between those bands it will be sunny, and push temperatures up to around 14 or 15.

'On the East Coast it will still be quite cloudy and chilly, with temperatures struggling to tip into double figures in the breeze blowing in from the East again.

'Away from the East in the North will probably get the best of the weather.

'But it looks like as we go through next week temperatures will recover, but it looks to be unsettled. I don't think we will have a return to the fine, settled conditions we have had for the last week or two.
