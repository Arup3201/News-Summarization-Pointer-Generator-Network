His incredible diving header against Spain at the World Cup was voted Holland's 'Sporting Moment of the Year' on Tuesday night.

And Robin van Persie was keen to share the moment with all generations of his family.

The Manchester United striker posted an Instagram picture with his grandad Wim Ras after accepting the accolade at the Dutch Sports Gala in Amsterdam.

Ras became a social media phenomenon when he joined the 'Persieing' trend during the World Cup

Van Persie's diving header in the 5-1 win over Spain was a highlight of the World Cup in Brazil 

Ras, who is 93, became a social media phenomenon back in the summer when he recreated his grandson's 'Flying Dutchman' pose from that goal in a popular trend known as 'Persieing'.

Van Persie captioned the Instagram snap: 'Another nice Picture with my family at the NOC NSF Sportgala 2014.'

The Holland captain flew through the air to meet Daley Blind's cross-field ball and send a looping header over Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas.
