No one likes to be sick or be near someone who is threatening to throw up.

But for a staggering three million Britons, vomit is so terrifying it causes intense panic and even obsessive behaviour, which in extreme cases leads to starvation and agoraphobia.

One person who to have suffered with emetophobia until just a few years ago is Louise Fellows, 37 from Maidenhead.

Louise started to fear being sick when she was eighty ears old and believes the phobia was triggered by whooping cough. She would sometimes wear a scarf around her face to avoid coming into contact with germs

'At 8 years old I developed an ever growing fear of sickness, and my parents think it could be linked to a serious bout of whooping cough I suffered,' said the leader of an international Telecoms company.

'Since then emetophobia has been a debilitating presence in my everyday life. I developed obsessive cleaning and sanitation habits as I as terrified of getting anything like Norovirus.

Louise explained that if her son was 
poorly as a baby she would avoid eating two to three days after coming into in contact with him to make sure she didn't vomit. Her weight plummeted.

Louise Fellows would panic about her son getting ill because she feared it would make her vomit. She also developed compulsive habits such as finger crossing to stop herself getting sick

'I’d wear a scarf over my face in 
'risky' situations, and I also developed mild compulsive habits such as 
finger crossing, praying to stop myself getting sick.

'I also spent far too many hours researching Norovirus on internet.

'When my son started school, I would 
obsessively aski around the school to see if any viruses were going
 around that might put my child at risk and subsequently me at risk.

Louise has since made a full recovery from her debilitating phobia thanks to a therapy called Thrive

It was only when Louise started to 
look for help that she realised she suffered with emetophobia and that 
her condition had a name.

Louise tried many different ways to treat her fear but nothing seemed to help.

'My doctor didn’t really understand what was happening to me, so she packed me off with some contacts for therapists and some leaflets about self-help, but these didn’t address 
the phobia itself and so I knew it wasn’t going to work.'

Louise tried therapy such as over-the-phone Talking Therapies, an NHS programme, following on from diagnosis of depression.

'The doctor summarised that my problem
 all stemmed from depression, but I knew that I wasn’t depressed.

'When I voiced my thoughts I was told,
 “Well, it must stem from anxiety then, so someone will be on hand in 
next week to talk to you about anxiety”.

'I was so frustrated that no 
one was listening to me.'

Emetophobia, a fear of vomiting or seeing others being sick, is thought to affect three million people in the UK.

The
 condition is not widely diagnosed, even though it is a fairly common anxiety disorder. It is thought to affect more women than men.

Emetophobia varies enormously in how it effects a sufferers - most worry excessively about being sick even though they are less likely than the general population to be ill because of all the steps they take to avoid being infected.

Some sufferers may be unable to leave home if there are any tummy bugs going around and they will avoid family and friends who have an illness.

They may also fear the feeling of being out of control while they are being sick or fear being sick in public which can trigger avoidance behaviours.

This can present problems for mothers who can experience extreme panic if their child is ill and will feel terrified if they are actually sick.

For emetophobes the mere sight of someone else being ill is enough to trigger obsessive behaviours. For many sufferers, vomitting makes them feel out of control

Many sufferers will also have a strict diet which is free from anything that might cause a stomach upset and some will avoid medications which list nausea as a side-effect.

Many women will also dread the thought of being pregnant because of concerns about coping with ‘morning-sickness’.

Treatment usually involves various forms of therapy - sometimes exposure therapy -  as well as antidepressants.

Another former sufferer is Anne Marie Bailey, 35, from Newbury, who traces her phobia back to having severe whooping cough as a little girl.

'The first time I realised it was an issue was when I was four or five.

'My older brother threw up in car on way home from a gymnastics display and I was so revolted and terrified by it, that I grabbed the door handle and threw myself out of the back of the car in the middle of a busy road.'

Anne Marie Bailey sometimes found her phobia so intense that she didn't think life was worth living

Throughout her childhood she avoided other children to prevent being sick.

She also avoided food to the extent where she was misdiagnosed with an eating disorder.

'At 14 I was dramatically underweight, to the point that I was given only two weeks to live.

'Doctors diagnosed me inaccurately with anorexia nervosa, but I never had body issues.

'I could see that I was far too thin, I just didn’t want to eat. Food was an inconvenience and a problem to me but it was hard to convince professionals that this wasn’t related to body image.'

Eventually she was put into on a re-feeding programme, where she was force-fed.

Anne-Marie went on to have exposure therapy where vomitting was induced by drinking a syrup which made her phobia worse.

'I became a recluse. I couldn’t eat, 
sleep or function on any level because of vomit.

'My life sometimes 
didn’t feel like it was worth living.

'I successfully avoided vomit 
for three decades but it came at a very high price.

'Every minute of the 
day was consumed with risk assessment, decisions based only on one 
factor – risk of vomit.

'Everything I did had this purpose – the food I 
ate, the clothes I wore, how I cleaned my house, where I went, who I 
saw.'

But both women have managed to overcome their disorder thanks to a new therapy called Thrive, which is similar to  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a type of talking treatment.

Doctors was inaccurately diagnosed Anne Marie with anorexia. She said: 'I could see that I was far too thin, I just didn't want to eat. Food was an inconvenience [because of my phobia].'

Devised by former hypnotherapist Rob Kelly, the treatment aims to help smokers, people who struggle with their weight, those who live in intense pain as well as sufferers of various phobias.

It is a six-part training programme that can be done at home with a book or at seminars or bootcamp.

It works by helping a person to better understand how they react to situations as well as change any unhealthy behaviours.

Anne Marie has now made a full recovery after undergoing the Thrive therapy programme

‘The main gist of Thrive is that it is not a type of therapy where something that is 'done to' a person,’ said Rob Kelly.

'It is about empowering people to [make changes] for themselves.

'It’s cheaper than traditional therapy, doesn't require raking up past experiences, and the person doesn't become reliant upon the consultant.

The nearest thing would be Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.’

Louise said: 'My Thrive therapist told me Thrive was a cure, not something that might help and that it would definitely work if I did everything she said in the sessions and stuck with it.

'One of fundamental giveaways, she said, is not the removal of negative thoughts but the way to process these negative thoughts into positive ones.

'A few days after my third session my little boy said he felt sick, which usually would have struck fear in me and had me running out of the house and calling a friend to come and look after him, but instead I comforted him and didn’t even think about the danger of him vomiting.

'I didn’t even think about it but I only realised this after the time. I’m not sure how it happened, but without realising it, I had been completely cured.'

Anne-Marie added: 'What was different 
about Thrive was that I taught myself to do it. The entire point is that
 nobody can change you except you.

You have to see the change you want to be and fix your internal thinking to fix your external behaviour.'
