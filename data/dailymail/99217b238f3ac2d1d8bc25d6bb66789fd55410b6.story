Fast bowler James Anderson has warned all of England's World Cup flops will face battles to salvage their limited-overs careers.

England boss Peter Moores has faced the brunt of the criticism and Anderson recognises his former Lancashire coach is under close scrutiny, after defeat to Bangladesh on Monday ended hopes of reaching the quarter-finals.

Anderson told The Sun: 'Peter's position might come under pressure in the next few weeks but every member of this squad should also come under pressure. There have been guys - myself included - who have not performed.'

Anderson, who has taken a meagre four wickets in five matches, is determined to emerge from his own doldrums and prove he can again be a menacing strike bowler at the highest level.

'I want to carry on,' he said in his column for the newspaper. 'I came into the World Cup as the number four-ranked one-day bowler in the world so my form in the last couple of years has been good.'

Yet he admits to feeling 'a mixture of seething anger and devastation' over England's performance in Australia and New Zealand, and said the team 'let down' the coaching staff and supporters.

England have faced widespread accusations of being out of step with the pace of modern one-day international cricket, and reliant on statistics rather than their instincts.

Anderson disputes that, and said: 'Peter does not suffocate players with statistics and data. The numbers are available if a player wants them. It is up to each individual.'

England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton has promised there will be no knee-jerk reaction to the team's failure, which may mean Moores is safe in his job for the medium term.

That would be welcomed by Anderson, who said: 'I want Peter to stay as head coach.'
