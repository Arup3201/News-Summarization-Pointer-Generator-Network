The worst airlines for losing passengers' bags has been revealed - and the company formerly called American Eagle Airline took the bottom spot despite a recent attempt to reinvent themselves.

It came last in a list compiled by the government which showed that it lost 8.82 bags per 1,000 passengers. It lost a total of 103,000 bags.

The result is almost ten times as bad as Virgin America, which is the least likely to mishandle your stuff. Virgin had just 0.97 incidents per 1,000 of lost bags.

Biggest loser: American Eagle airlines - which has since rebranded to Envoy Airlines - lost more bags per passenger than any others

Where's mine? Overall, all domestic U.S. airlines lost 3.71 bags for every 1,000 passengers

The airline - which rebranded to call itself Envoy Airlines this January - took the bottom spot for the second year in a row, after losing 25,000 more bags than it did in 2013. 

The latest figures cover the period from January to September this year, during which 1.6million pieces of luggage were lost or damaged.

This was reported by a total of 436million passengers, giving an average rate of loss of 3.71 bags per 1,000, or just under 0.4 per cent.

Staples Delta Airlines and JetBlue both scored better than average in the ranking, losing 2.08 and 2.44 bags per thousand respectively. 

However, the figures may be concealing an even bigger lost baggage problem, as they count all passengers on a plane rather than just those who check in bags.

As an increasing proportion of fliers opt to check in no bags at all - which therefore cannot be lost. This means that the real rate of loss will be higher. 

A spokesman for Envoy told DailyMail.com: 'Envoy is actively working to improve its bag handling performance by adding equipment and employees its hubs.

'The company will also be developing and implementing several, larger company-wide initiatives to ensure fewer bags are mishandled throughout the Envoy system.'
