A 62-year-old woman died in a house fire caused by overloading a double socket with at least 12 electrical items.

Spinster Avril Topham lived in the lounge with her beloved Jack Russell dog because she couldn’t manage the stairs of her terraced house.

Fire chiefs yesterday issued a warning about the dangers of overloading plugs after an investigating revealed nine pieces of electrical equipment and three separate four-point extension adaptors had been linked to a double wall socket.

Miss Topham, who lived in the house all her life, had three table lamps, two television sets, a coffee heater, hand-held vacuum, a convector heater and a melted plastic appliance that could not be identified all connected up.

There were also three different four-point adaptors connected to the same double socket and a fourth - which was badly burnt and found nearby - may also have been plugged in.

Miss Topham probably had at least double the amount of items that were safe to use.

The West Yorkshire Fire Service said the blaze was caused by a combination of overloading and a damaged extension cable.

‘We would urge people to make sure they are not overloading their sockets and get old extension cables checked,’ said station manager Richard Hagger.

Neighbours in Brownhill Crescent, Leeds, called 999 after being alerted by a fire alarm going off in the early hours.

Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus broke into the property and rescued Miss Topham, but she died in hospital. Her dog Minnie also died in the blaze.

Next door neighbour Mebrahtu Gebrelibanos said: ‘I could hear Avril banging on her front door shouting for help and I could smell smoke so I ran back inside and called 999.

‘I tried to open the door but it was locked from the inside. She was trapped in the house and by the time the fire service broke the door down it was sadly too late.

She was a very good neighbour. God bless her.’ Miss Topham lived with her father until his death a few years ago. Neighbours helped her with shopping and cooked her meals due to her health problems.

Neighbour Sarah Grainger, 24, said: ‘She struggled to walk and was living in the living room of her house as she couldn’t get up the stairs.

‘I think she was waiting to be rehomed by the council to a flat without stairs because she couldn’t manage in her house.’
