Oscar Pistorious's lawyers have launched a bid to prevent prosecutors appealing his manslaughter conviction ahead of a a possible new murder trial over the death of Reeva Steenkamp.

Lawyers for the jailed South African Olympic said yesterday they have launched a legal bid to prevent prosecutors from appealing against his acquittal on murder charges.

Prosecutors want Pistorius, 28, convicted of the more serious crime of murder for shooting girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013 - and in December they were granted permission by Judge Thokozile Masipa  to appeal against his acquittal.

Lawyers for jailed South African Olympic Oscar Pistorius (pictured during his trial) have announced they have launched a legal bid to prevent prosecutors from appealing against his acquittal on murder charges

The double amputee athlete was acquitted by Judge Masipa of both premeditated murder and the lesser murder charge of dolus eventualis, also known as common-law murder.  

In South African law dolus eventualis applies if the accused knew they might kill someone but still went ahead with their course of action.

Pistorius was instead convicted of culpable homicide, or manslaughter, and sentenced to five years in prison

Prosecutors argue that Judge Masipa misinterpreted the law when she cleared Pistorius of murder on the basis that he did not intentionally shoot Ms Steenkamp.

But now defence lawyers are challenging the judge's decision to allow prosecutors to appeal as they do not want the culpable homicide verdict to be overturned

Pistorius lawyers' said in a brief statement yesterday that they have applied to argue against allowing prosecutors to appeal. Their application will be heard in court on March 13.

Pistorius's legal team say his conviction was based on facts presented during the trial, not on an interpretation of law, and therefore cannot be appealed.

'We will argue that these are matters of fact, rather than matters of law,' they said in a statement. 

Judge Masipa presided over Pistorius' seven-month murder trial last year and heard how hr shot Reeva Steenkamp multiple times through a closed toilet door in his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day.

She ruled Pistorius, known as the 'Blade Runner' for his prosthetic legs he wears on the track, did not intend to kill Reeva and acquitted him of murder, but found he acted negligently when he fired four times through the door from close range with his 9 mm pistol. 

During the trial, Pistorius testified that he shot the model four times through a locked toilet door, believing she was an intruder.

Prosecutors argued he deliberately killed the 29-year-old law graduate after an argument, but Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled they had failed to prove intent.  

If the Supreme Court of Appeal finds that Pistorius should have been found guilty of murder, as prosecutors contend, he faces a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison.  

But the challenge by his lawyers to the appeal is likely to delay the process.

Pistorius's trial last year attracted massive international interest and revealed a darker side to the once-revered athlete.

He is currently serving his prison term in the hospital ward of a Pretoria prison, away from the often overcrowded cells of South Africa's jails, which are notorious for gang violence.

He could be eligible to be moved to house arrest in August, when he may be able to serve the remainder of his sentence at his uncle's home.
