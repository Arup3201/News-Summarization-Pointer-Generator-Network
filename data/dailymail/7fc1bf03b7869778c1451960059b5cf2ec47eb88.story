A builder suffered weeks of agony and has needed two operations after he was bitten by a false widow spider.

Dean Greenhill, 35, said the bite swelled up to the size of a tennis ball after he was bitten while working on an old building in south London.

Mr Greenhill, of Ware, Hertfordshire, said he was on the roof of the building when he felt a pain in his leg and soon after found it difficult to walk.

Agony: Builder Dean Greenhill, 35, needed two operations after he was bitten by a false widow spider

He told the Daily Star: 'First I went to an out-of-hours GP, but later I needed an operation to drain and clear the wound. Then it swelled up again and I had a second op. It's still not sorted, seven weeks on.'

Remarkaby, after weeks off work, Mr Greenhill discovered another of the spiders at a different site, but this time kept well clear.

Mr Greenhill is the latest reported case of a false widow spider bite in the UK.

On Friday MailOnline reported how teenager Stephanie Georgiou feared she would lose her hand after she was bitten while watching a horror film at the cinema.

She was rushed to hospital and needed
 three operations after she was nipped by the spider on a date at the 
Enfield cinema earlier this month.

The
 18-year-old has been scarred for life and left so traumatised by the 
experience that she has vowed to never go back to the cinema.

And last Monday, MailOnline reported how housewife Alison Blackburn, of Strood, Kent, has been left too scared to sleep in her own bedroom after she ended up in intensive care when she was bitten by one of the spiders.

Ms Blackburn, 49, has been sleeping on her sofa as she is too terrified to return to the room where she was bitten.

Surgeons had to drain the poison from her left foot after the attack, as her ankle ballooned and the pain spread to her pelvic area.

Mr Greenhill is the latest reported case of a false widow spider bite in the UK

False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing.

The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size.

Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom.

The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas.

The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England.

HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE

Do not disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened.

To avoid being bitten while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs.

Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight.

If you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing items.

If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.
