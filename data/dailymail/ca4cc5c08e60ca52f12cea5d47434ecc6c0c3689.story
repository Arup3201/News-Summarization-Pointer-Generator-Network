Don't you just hate it when you're having a really good game of football, then Optimus Prime saves your overhead kick from sailing into the bottom corner?

Charlton Athletic midfielder Diego Poyet - son of Sunderland manager and ITV pundit Gus - does, as the 19-year-old stars in an advert for the new Transformers film.

It starts with the youngster showing off his skills in training, before goalkeeper Optimus Prime controls the ball then crushes it before the England youth's eyes.

Ready: Diego Poyet is the standout name of the Transformers advert for the upcoming movie

Air: Poyet shows off his skills in the ad, dribbling around other players before he gets to unleash a shot

Overhead: Poyet, donning number 39 on his kit, gets his shot away at goal... in front of an empty stadium

Goalkeeper: Optimus Prime stops the shot from sailing in with his foot

Crush: Optimus Prime crushes the ball in front of Poyet after saving the shot

Diego Poyet, alongside fellow footballers Gor Grigoryan and Patrick Otte, will hope to carry the same skills he shows in the clip into next season with Championship outfit Charlton.

Last season, he won the Charlton Player of the Year award. That came, incredibly, despite the youngster only breaking into the team as a regular in February.

Poyet, born in Spain to Uruguayan parents and raised in England, finds himself in a rare predicament.

The potential star can play for all three, as he holds a passport for each, but has represented England at U16 and U17 levels, and hopes to break into the U19 team and beyond.

He did, however, tell Sportsmail that he would represent Uruguay or Spain if the opportunity arose, saying: 'You never know in the future. Maybe England wouldn't want me and someone else would.'

Poyet, donning number 39 in the ad, took to Twitter after @ICON_SPORTSUK posted the video and said: 'This is the new advert I was talking to you about. Hope you like it.'

Meanwhile, his dad, Gus, is living it up in Brazil, reporting as an expert on the World Cup for ITV.

It seems to be going well, too, considering the cool look the Sunderland boss cut by Copacabana beach in Rio on Sunday.

Cool dude: Gus Poyet appeared to be enjoying the afternoon sunshine in his shades
