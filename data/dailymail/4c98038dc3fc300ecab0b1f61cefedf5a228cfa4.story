Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim warned his players not to rest on their laurels, telling them that they face the most difficult night of their careers when they defend their 3-1 lead at Stade Louis II  against Arsenal on Tuesday night.

Portuguese coach Jardim emphasised the threat of Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla and is trying to prepare his players for an expected attacking onslaught from Arsenal, with the Barclays Premier League side needing to at least three goals to go through in the Champions League tie.

Jardim said: 'At this stage we're now at half-time and we're two goals ahead but it's true that our opponents have so many quality players in their squad. So it will be very difficult for us and everyone knows if it will be the most difficult game we've had in years.

'I don't think Arsenal underestimated - it's just that we played a dream game at the Emirates. When facing such a team as Arsenal with players like Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil and Danny Welbeck, it's true we can't take it easy and have to focus on the game we played at Emirates.

'In comparison to pervious years French teams are playing at a better level in the Champions League. Paris Saint-Germain knocked out Chelsea and they showed the quality of the work done here in France. It was the same case for Monaco. What we're trying to do is to show the quality of the work. Maybe it's the year of France to beat the English.'

Monaco midfielder Nabil Dirar said: 'No-one expected us to win at Arsenal and we enjoyed the moment but then we forgot it straightaway. Because we know they have quality players so we know we might have a little advantage but tomorrow it'll be a very difficult game. I think we'll see the real face of Arsenal tomorrow. But we have our strengths and we can play counter attack.'
