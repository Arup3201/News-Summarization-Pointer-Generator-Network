Belinda Carlisle has now completed training to become a yoga instructor

Eighties pop veteran Belinda Carlisle may be back in the charts, but don’t expect a major comeback.

At 55, and with a string of hits behind her, Belinda has decided on a new career – in yoga. She recently completed training as an instructor and plans to start leading classes. She says: ‘I’ve been doing yoga on and off for 20 years but I became more serious about it six years ago. I do it every day for up to four hours.’

The American star is an advocate of Kundalini yoga. ‘It’s more internal and  about energy and chakras and breaking through emotional barriers. It’s pretty intense,’ she says.

Belinda, whose new album is a greatest-hits set called The Collection, has also returned to vegetarianism after a 20-year break.

‘I just couldn’t eat meat any more. I found it disgusting and I can’t support factory farming – it’s too cruel. I don’t feel deprived, though, even though I don’t drink, smoke or eat meat. I’ve had 30 years of all that and I don’t feel I’m missing anything.’

Fertility experts are trying to find out if vitamins could help outcomes for IVF patients.

‘Recent studies suggest a Mediterranean diet rich in Vitamin D and Omega-3 might improve the outcome from IVF,’ says Professor Nick Macklon, medical director of the Complete Fertility Centre at University Hospital, Southampton, where the trial involving 110 couples is running.

The study is assessing how following two different diets six weeks prior to IVF treatment affects the quality of sperm and egg cells.

People who have hernia repairs expect to recover too quickly and so cope less well, says new research.

The operation involves closing a gap in the  muscle walls of the abdomen, through which soft tissue can protrude and cause pain.

While the repair can be done quickly using keyhole surgery, people often feel pain and fatigue for up to a week afterwards.

Women and people under 60 take even longer, say researchers, at the US Mayo Clinic.

Help is at hand for women who want to wear skirts or shorts but are put off by unsightly leg tattoos.

A new make-up, Cover Secret Leg Camouflage Kit, has been launched to hide ‘leg imperfections’, which may also include varicose veins and scars.

It lasts 24 hours and is water-resistant so can be used on the beach. The £34.99 kit is available in light or medium. coversecret.co.uk

A new free ‘sound generator’  website 
plays an array of sounds that can have health benefits – such as easing 
tinnitus, helping insomnia and calming distressed babies.

Users on 
Noisli can pick high-quality sounds of the forest, water, rain, sheep, 
owls, the seaside, coffee shops and white noise.

The sound generator is available as a web application on smartphones or tablets, as well as online.

While
 you play the sounds, at home or in the office, there’s a 
colour-changing background which works according to the principles of 
chromotherapy (colour therapy).

A blue screen is said to help with 
creative work, for example, while red is good for detail-oriented tasks.
