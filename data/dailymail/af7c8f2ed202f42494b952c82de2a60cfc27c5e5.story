Tory MP Tim Yeo is an enthusiast for wind farms, but is opposing one in his own local area

A senior Tory MP and leading supporter
 of green energy is risking accusations of hypocrisy after objecting to 
plans for a giant wind turbine in his constituency.

As
 chairman of the Commons energy and climate change select committee, Tim
 Yeo has called for the urgent building of renewable energy sources and 
claimed it may be necessary ‘to bribe’ communities to accept wind farms.

The
 former environment minister also has close links to green firms and 
last year raked in more than £73,000 from directorships in the industry.

But
 he has joined local residents in opposing plans for a 130-metre turbine
 five miles from his home in his Suffolk South constituency.

Mr
 Yeo, 68, last night denied that his position made him a Nimby (Not in 
my back yard).

He told the Mail: ‘My own view is that wind turbines are a
 good idea, but I have always said in rural areas if the local community
 feels very strongly they should be able to say no in some 
circumstances.

‘Wind 
turbines can be environmentally very intrusive.

'In this case there’s a 
little village, Belstead, with less than 200 people. It would be very 
prominent in relation to this little village and I fully understand 
their objections to it.’

Mr
 Yeo, who was last night  speaking against the wind turbine at a public 
meeting, said: ‘I’ve promised to use all the influence I’ve got to 
persuade the local authority to reject it.

‘Onshore
 wind is a technology which has a contribution to make in Britain, in 
the right place.

'But I don’t think they should be imposed on a little 
village where the residents think it would be environmentally damaging.’

Last year Mr Yeo said it was time to 'work harder to find places where wind farms are acceptable'

David Cobbold, 75, 
chairman of Belstead Parish Council, admitted Mr Yeo’s intervention 
could be seen as ‘odd’ considering his position on green energy, but 
added: ‘He has been besieged by residents and has listened patiently to 
them.’

Mr Cobbold said: ‘It
 is a beautiful area criss-crossed with footpaths and they are going to 
plonk a 130-metre monster in the middle of it where it is going to 
affect everybody.’

The proposed turbine site at Pannington Hall, near 
Ipswich, is on land owned by the family of Peter Aldous, the 
Conservative  MP who represents the neighbouring constituency.

The
 land is currently rented out to Jimmy’s Farm, the pig farm run by Jimmy
 Doherty that has featured in television series on BBC 2 and Channel 4.

Mr
 Yeo, who has been MP for South Suffolk since 1983, is facing 
deselection after the local Conservative Association’s executive 
committee voted to ‘not re-adopt’ him as its candidate.

He has been 
accused of not devoting enough time to his constituency.

Mr
 Yeo is chairman of a biofuel company, TMO Renewables, has worked for 
AFC Energy, a firm developing alkaline fuel cell technology, and has led
 meetings of renewable energy generation firm, Albion Community Power.

Partnerships
 for Renewables, which is behind the scheme, has said the turbine would 
 generate enough electricity to supply 1,280 homes.
