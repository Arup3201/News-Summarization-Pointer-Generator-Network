Sinister: Sean Ivaldi, 18, was allegedly planning to shoot fellow students at his school in Stoughton, Massachusetts

A high school student has been charged after he was found with a journal where he outlined a 'Columbine-style' attack on his school.

Sean Ivaldi, 18, was being held by police after jottings he made in his journal, including a points system for his kills, was discovered by a teacher.

The system he had scribbled down awarded 20 points for killing a student, 30 points for teachers, and 60 points for a police officer during the rampage he had allegedly planned at his school in Stoughton, Massachusetts.

Although
the teenage boy did not possess any weapons, police believed he posed enough 
danger to arrest him for making terror threats.

He is currently being held without bail.

Police in Stoughton said the journal was written last summer when Ivaldi was 17.

As
well as the kill list, there appeared to be details of how the 
massacre at Stoughton High School would be carried out and drawings of the premises.

The plan to carry out the 
massacre was found by a teacher who took the journal to the school's 
principal Matt Colantonio.

Ivaldi was removed from the school on April 13 but was not charged with any offence. He was later held by police who said there was enough evidence to warrant charges.

Stoughton Police spokesman Robert Devine
said: 'The kid had plans, but they were made in August, and he hadn’t 
acted on them to this point.

'We have to take every potential threat seriously and that’s what we did in this case.'

Police said their investigation revealed that the teen did not have access to firearms.

The 18-year-old is next due in court on May 18.

Ivaldi was charged with causing a school disturbance, four counts of threatening to commit a crime and a felony charge of making a terror threat.

The 1999 massacre at Columbine school in Colorado remains America's worst school shooting. Twelve students and one teacher were killed in the shooting spree by two pupils.
