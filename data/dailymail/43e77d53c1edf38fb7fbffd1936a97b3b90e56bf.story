Cate Edwards, daughter of disgraced politician John Edwards, today admitted that it would have been far easier to stay angry at her father after he had an affair while her mother was dying of cancer.

However she said that with 'commitment and persistence' she now has a good relationship with him and had even met his lovechild, five-year-old Quinn.

John Edwards, a one-time presidential hopeful, began an affair with videographer Rielle Hunter on the campaign trail in 2004, around the time his popular wife Elizabeth revealed that she was battling advanced breast cancer. Elizabeth Edwards died in 2010 at the age of 61.

His eldest daughter Cate told Katie Couric on Monday that her father gave her the news of his  devastating affair in person.

Cate Edwards talked today about her anger at her father John Edwards following his affair while her mother Elizabeth was dying from cancer

She said: 'My
 dad told me, he really felt like he needed to be upfront with me. I was 
an adult so he felt like he could have that conversation. It was very 
difficult.'

Couric, who had interviewed John and Elizabeth Edwards on the campaign trail, asked Cate Edwards if she was 'enraged' by her father's actions. 

Ms Edwards said: 'There's
 anger but there's still so much
 love there. We both worked together to work through it and get our 
relationship to the point that it is today, which is that we have a great
 relationship.'

She added: 'It was hard, it took a lot of commitment but I wouldn't have had it any other way.

'We've been through so much together, our family has been through a lot and he was there, we were both there through all of that.

'It's not simple... I think it would be easier to have stayed angry. Forgiveness is tough and it takes commitment and persistence... and a lot of love.'

The 31-year-old also revealed that she had met her father's youngest daughter from that affair with Hunter, five-year-old Quinn.

Cate Edwards appeared on Katie Couric's chat show on Monday to talk about her charity work for breast cancer research in her mother Elizabeth's memory (pictured on the screen behind her)

Family: Cate (center) was very close to her mother Elizabeth (seen here in 2008), who died of cancer in 2010. She works to raise awareness of advanced stage breast cancer. The picture shows the family on the campaign trail with her father John and younger siblings Emma Claire and Jack

She told Katie
 that the little girl was 'cute and adorable' but they didn't see each 
other much as Ms Edwards lives in DC and Quinn with her mother in North 
Carolina. She added that Quinn had a great relationship with her father.

Following the testing
 time of a public sex scandal, Ms Edwards was by her father's side in 
2011 when he was indicted on six felony counts for allegedly misusing 
campaign funds in an effort to hide his relationship with Hunter.

A federal jury eventually found Edwards not guilty on one count and deadlocked on the others.

Ms Edwards said that following all the trials that life had thrown at her, she was shown 'just how much strength you can garner'.

She also used the opportunity to raise awareness for a campaign to help those with advanced stage breast cancer.

It is an issue she feels passionately about after losing her mother 
Elizabeth to the disease. Ms Edwards said: 'I'm doing really well now but I think about my mom every single day. She's a huge part of my life still.

'I'm doing a lot of great work in her honor, things I think that would make her proud.'

She said that following her cancer diagnosis, her mother focused on making every day count.

She said: 'She didn't bury her head in the sand. She didn't hole up in her bedroom. She decided this was her opportunity to live out her last days.

'She showed her children a graceful, graceful way to live.'

Sisters: Cate Edwards said that her half-sister Quinn was 'cute and adorable'. John Edwards fathered the child with Rielle Hunter in a scandalous affair that ended his high-flying political career
