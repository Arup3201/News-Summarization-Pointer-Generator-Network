It was hailed as the prison from which there could be no escape. If the freezing water and powerful currents didn't get you then the sharks would.

But a 62-year-old grandmother has succeeded where hundreds of the most hardened criminals failed, swimming the treacherous mile-and-a-half from infamous Alcatraz Prison to the shores of San Fransisco Bay.Â 

Jacky Portingale, a receptionist from the UK, took on the gruelling challenge during her summer vacation and claimed the waters were far warmer than those around her home town of Bristol.

Jacky, who started open water swimming when her son Lee took up the sport, said she prefers to stick to 'little swims' - of up to two miles.

The currents in the bay were a problem with Jacky having to be guided back in the right direction by a safety marshal in a canoe after she started to get 'swept away' in the direction of the Golden Gate Bridge.

But she completed the course in an hour and 16 minutes - somewhere behind son Lee, who clocked just 31 minutes.

She said: 'I thought it was a joke at first, I had heard that nobody had ever escaped from Alcatraz, partly because of the currents and the cold.

'I said I was too old for that and 
would never do it. But she booked it up and gave it to me as a Christmas
present, so there was no backing out.

'I
had been training at Henleaze Lake in Bristol and when I first went in 
there it was ten degrees, so we didn't find it cold at all. They said 
'you're from England, you'll be fine'.'

US authorities claim only one 
prisoner ever managed to survive the swim from the world-famous American
prison in San Francisco Bay.

In 1962 John Paul Scott washed up on the rocks at Fort Point. He was discovered by a group of boys who thought he was an unsuccessful suicide attempt from the Golden Gate Bridge.

Would-be escapees who got past the 
notorious prison's armed guards, barbed wire fences, sheer walls and 
cliffs then had to take on the strong currents and cold temperatures and
even the risk of shark attack.

For 29 years Alcatraz prison held some of America's most dangerous prisoners including mobsters Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly.

During that time 36 prisoners tried to escape but only one was proved to have made it to the mainland, where he was found suffering from hypothermia, although some people claim another three convicts listed as 'presumed drowned' actually made a clean getaway.

Organised swims from the island to the mainland now take place regularly.

Those taking part do not have to contend with one of the hazards that faced convicts going into the water - guards firing at them from the island's watch towers.

But they are warned to beware of the 
strong currents in the bay, where the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers 
flow into the Pacific Ocean.

Afterwards
Mrs Portingale, who works at Shirehampton Health Centre, and her lorry 
driver husband William, 64, enjoyed a holiday to Yosemite National Park,
Death Valley, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.

On the night of June 11, 1962, Frank Lee Morris and brothers Clarence and John Anglin climbed through spoon-dug tunnels to escape the 'The Rock', launching themselves into choppy seas on a raft made of rubber raincoats.

The fugitives - all bank robbers - were never found despite one of the biggest-scale manhunts in history.

Officials claim they almost certainly drowned in the turbulent tides of the 10-mile-wide bay, with their bodies swept out to sea under the Golden Gate Bridge.

The legendary prison break, plotted by criminal mastermind Morris, is one of the most intriguing unsolved mysteries of our time and was made into the 1979 film 'Escape from Alcatraz' starring Clint Eastwood.

Just like any other evening, prison guards regularly checked on the prisoners on the night of the escape and noticed nothing out of the ordinary.

But by morning, the three had vanished, leaving pillows and lifelike papier-mache masks with real hair in their beds.

Federal agents, local and state police, coast guard boats and military helicopters scoured the prison complex on Alcatraz Island, then widened the manhunt to the expanse of San Francisco Bay and the surrounding area of Northern California.

The fugitives' raft was found on a nearby island but the three were never found.

The prisoners had spent months digging through an eight-inch-thick wall in their cell block using spoons and butter knives. They disguised the holes with painted cardboard.

On the night of the escape, they squeezed through the tunnels into a utility hallway and then climbed down a drainpipe and through an exhaust vent to the roof.

They slid down another vent and scaled two barbed wire fences before launching the raft they crafted using 50 raincoats from the northeast edge of the island.
