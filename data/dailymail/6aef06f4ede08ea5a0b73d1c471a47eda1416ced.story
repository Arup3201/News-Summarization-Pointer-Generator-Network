The federal government is using a legal process called 'civil forfeiture' to seize massive amounts of money from unsuspecting Americans – without alleging that they've committed any crimes.

Laws put on the books to help the government track drug trafficking proceeds and terrorists' cash reserves are regularly contorted, according to a civil rights group, by prosecutors who see easy access to piles of cash that ultimately pays their salaries.

The financial seizures leave some honest small businessmen and women out of luck when their life savings disappear and their family trades teeter on the edge of insolvency.

In one case, the IRS took $446,000 from a mostly cash-only small business that distributes candy, snacks and cigarettes to convenience stores. Brothers Jeffrey, Richard and Mitch Hirsch lost that money two years ago when the federal government raided their bank account.

In another, the government grabbed $33,000 from Iowa restaurateur Carole Hinders, who deals only in cash. No criminal charges have been brought in either case.

Carole Hinders runs a cash-only Mexican restaurant in Iowa; federal agents knocked on her door in 2013 to say they had seized her bank account, and she has never been charged with any crime

Jeffrey, Richard and Mitch Hirsch operate a candy and snack distributorship and customarily deal in large amounts of cash – reason enough for the IRS to seize $446,000 from their accounts and sit on it for two years

'I did not do anything wrong, but they took my money,' Hinders said Monday. 'I was unable to pay my bills for the first time in my life. I had to borrow money, use my credit cards and beg vendors to extend me credit. This nightmare has left me broke, frightened and exhausted.'

The Institute for Justice, a nonprofit legal organization, is representing Hinders and the Hirsch family.

The New York Times interviewed David Smith, a former federal prosecutor who is now a forfeiture expert. 'They're going after people who are really not criminals,' Smith said. 'They're middle-class citizens who have never had any trouble with the law.'

Institute for Justice attorney Larry Salzman told MailOnline that 'civil forfeiture is a nationwide scandal. ... It's one of the most significant threats to private property in the country.'

'The bottom line is that these harsh civil forfeiture laws were aimed at serious criminals. Nobody expected them to be used against people for depositing their own money in their own bank accounts.' 

Equally troubling, he said, is that the laundry list of federal agencies that take Americans' property on a regular basis can keep it – pocketing cash and selling other assets – in order to pay salaries and grow their budgets for the next round of seizures.

While they ultimately refer criminal cases to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution, forfeited assets stay with the investigating agencies.

Salzman wouldn't comment on the personalities involved, but said the conflict of interest made his job harder.

'Prying this power away from government agencies is always met with resistance,' he said. 'They are benefiting directly financially from these forfeitures and that's a major part of the problem.'

After the Times inquired with the IRS, the agency said it would soon pare back its efforts at targeting money belonging to law-abiding citizens.

Its investigators will instead focus on funds they believe were ill-gotten or fall into unspecified 'exceptional circumstances.' But past seizures will not be resolved any differently.

IRS Criminal Investigations chief Richard Weber said in a statement to the Times that the 'policy update' will help his unit 'focus our limited investigative resources on identifying and investigating violations within our jurisdiction that closely align with C.I.'s mission and key priorities.'  

'I did not do anything wrong, but they took my money,' Hinders said. 'This nightmare has left me broke, frightened and exhausted'

Court papers: Hinders had the rare courtesy of a court order for her cash, but she hasn't been granted a hearing and won't see a judge until June 2015 – two years after her money was snatched

Bi-County Distributors, the Hirsches' 27-year-old business, regularly makes large cash bank deposits. So does Mrs. Lady's Mexican Food, the lunch spot that Hinders operates. 

But it's the amounts of those deposits that caught the IRS's attention. Banks are required to report cash transactions of $10,000 or more, so a common practice among drug traffickers and other criminals is to keep deposits in the four-figure range.

The feds sometimes flag a repeated pattern of deposits near but less than $10,000 as 'structured' payments – and there's a federal law against it.

But no one has accused either business of violating it, or any other law. Neither forfeiture was preceded by a warning of any kind. 

Weber insists that depositing amounts less than $10,000 in order to evade reporting laws is still a crime, even if the funds were earned legally. Some taxpayers, an IRS official told MailOnline Monday, use series of small cash deposits to avoid income tax reporting.

'The government is not going to lessen its attention on tax evasion,' the official said, 'so scrutinizing cash depositors is always going to be part of our approach.'

In the Hirsches' case, the government never formally applied to a court for permission to take their cash. That's a clear violation of the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, the Institute for Justice says.

Congress passed that law in 2000 to curb abuses by prosecutors under forfeiture laws.

'Prosecutors in some offices spent years trying to undermine those reforms,' said Salzman, the Institute for Justice attorney. 'This case would set an important precedent that greater due process is required in forfeiture cases than many prosecutors seem to believe.'

'Besides, these people have a right to defend themselves. The government shouldn't take property under these laws from people who did nothing wrong and didn't even know that they were potentially breaking some obscure banking law.'

Hinders runs Mrs. Lady's Mexican Food in Arnolds Park, Iowa, and accepts only cash and checks

Cash inventory: Jeff Hirsch, one of three brothers who own Bi-County Distributors on Long Island is still out $446,000 as the government sits on the company's cash and won't explain why

Salzman told MailOnline that the government typically drags its feet when challenged – or has to be dragged into court to explain itself.

'Civil forfeiture laws do not provide for any prompt hearing in front of a judge. They violate the basic notion of due process,' he said.

'The government can take this money and just sit on it, and try to force you into a settlement. Which is what they've done in this case and in others.'

In the Iowa case, the Times reported Monday that Hinders got a knock on her door last year from two federal agents who told her that her checking account had been seized.

'How can this happen?' she asked the Times. 'Who takes your money before they prove that you've done anything wrong with it?'

Hinders won't see a judge until at least May 2015, since she's not entitled to a preliminary hearing where a judge might conclude the IRS had no justification to take her earnings.

'We're just saying the government should have to show it has probable cause to hold that money,' Salzman said. 'Why not give a prompt post-seizure hearing to make sure the government doesn't have the facts wrong?'
