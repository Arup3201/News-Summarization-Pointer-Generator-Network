A frantic search is underway for a 21-year-old Starbucks barista who mysteriously vanished on her two-minute drive to work.

Whitney Heichel left her apartment, which she shares with her husband, in Gresham, Oregon at 6.45am on Tuesday for a 7am shift but failed to turn up to work.

Six hours later, her SUV was found with a smashed window in a Walmart parking lot four miles from her home - and police learned it had been seen at a gas station in the hours in between.

Friends said that a gas station attendant claimed the vehicle had been driven by a man, who was acting 'suspicious and hurried', as Heichel sat in the passenger seat.

Her husband, Clint Heichel, told Fox 12 that he learned of his wife's disappearance when her manager at Starbucks called to say she had not arrived for her shift.

'She got dressed this morning, normal everything. Kissed me goodbye, said goodbye,' he said on Tuesday.

'(At) about 8:15 her boss called me and said, "Hey, I was just curious, did Whitney decide to be sick or not feeling well? Have you seen her or talked to her?"' he told KATU.

Mr Heichel tried calling and texting her, but she did not respond.

Extensive search: Clint alerted authorities after Heichel failed to turn up for work on Tuesday in Gresham, Oregon

Worried, he drove to her parents' home 
and then to a hospital in the area, as well as calling family and 
friends to see if anyone knew of her whereabouts.

When they could provide no further 
information, he called police to report her missing at 9.56am, and 
friends and family began distributing flyers and searching for her.

Detectives learned that her vehicle, a black 1999 Ford Explorer, was seen and her ATM card was used at a gas station three miles from her home at 9.14am.

Her
 missing poster claims an attendant said she was in the passenger seat next to a man, who was 'acting suspicious and hurried'. It adds that he was driving the car and 
bought a small amount of gas, but police could not confirm this.

Abandoned: Her black 1999 Ford Explorer was found in a WalMart parking lot four miles from her home with a window smashed. It looked as if it had been rummaged through, friends said

Targeted: Police confirmed that her SUV was seen at a gas station before the vehicle was found in a car park

At 1pm, family and friends looking for
 Heichel found her vehicle, with the passenger window smashed, at a Walmart in Wood Village, around four miles from her home.

It appeared as if someone had rummaged through the car, according to her missing poster.

'The passenger side window was busted
 out, the backseats were down, there was mud on her tires, which it 
wasn't that way the night before,' Clint Heichel said.

'It just is weird that we found her truck, completely off the path that she would take to go to work.'

He added: 'Anyone who has a loved one or is 
married knows if your spouse goes missing and there's no word... I don't 
know what to say, I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do.'

Details: Family and friends had been handing out flyers in the area in the hopes of gathering information before her body was found

Gresham police said that there is surveillance
 video showing the SUV at the gas station, but the video 
is poor quality and detectives are unable to see who is driving the car.

Police have called her disappearance suspicious and continue to follow leads, Sgt. Claudio Grandjean said.

Family and friends continue to search for the young woman, setting up Facebook groups and handing out fliers across the area.
