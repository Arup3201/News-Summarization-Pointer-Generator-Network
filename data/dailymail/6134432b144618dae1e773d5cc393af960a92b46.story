The Queen was certainly in a springtime mood  as she arrived to open The Wing at the National Memorial to the Few, in Capel-le-Ferne, Kent, on Thursday.

Her Majesty wore a sky blue wool coat with a royal blue collar and matching pockets and trim, topping off the look with a blue hat. 

The Queen and The Duke were greeted by Prince Michael of Kent, who is a patron of the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon.

The royal couple viewed the video wall and other special effects that bring to life the Battle of Britain and the life of 'The Few', who fought in the skies overheard to keep Britain free from invasion during the summer and early Autumn of 1940. 

The monarch and Duke then met trustees, supporters and volunteers before meeting local school children learning about the Battle of Britain in the dedicated education area, The Geoffrey Page Centre. 

The Queen and The Duke also visited the 'Cockpit Café', where they met a group of 'The Few', surviving RAF airmen who fought in the Battle of Britain in the Second World War, before viewing a flypast of a Hurricane, Spitfire and Typhoon.

As part of her duties, the Queen unveiled a plaque to mark the opening and received a posy.

In the 1980s, Wing Commander Geoffrey Page, a Hurricane pilot who was shot down during the Battle of Britain, realised that there was no national memorial to the men he had with flown with in 1940. 

His efforts to amend this led to the founding of the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust and the unveiling of the National Memorial to the Few – a lone pilot looking out over the English Channel, in the village between Folkestone and Dover – by Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

Maintained by the Trust, the site at Capel-le-Ferne is dedicated to Churchill's famous 'Few' who fought in the skies overheard to keep Britain free from invasion. 

The Battle of Britain Memorial Trust’s new Wing building is home to the high-tech, interactive Scramble Experience, which tells the story of the Battle of Britain, while the Geoffrey Page Centre, is a dedicated teaching space for schools to use.

The building itself follows the wing plan of RJ Mitchell’s most iconic fighter, the Supermarine Spitfire, one of the two aircraft credited with doing the most to win the Battle of Britain in 1940. 

The building copies the Spitfire’s uplifted wing shape and has a central first floor café, which looks directly across the Channel towards France, from where enemy aircraft would have appeared 75 years ago.

The Wing will complement the other attractions at the National Memorial, which include the Christopher Foxley-Norris Memorial Wall, listing the names of those who took part in the Battle, the Memorial itself and a replica Hurricane and Spitfire.

Canterbury Cathedral is the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Cathedral is both a holy place and part of a World Heritage Site. 

Founded in 597 AD by St Augustine, it is arguably the oldest institution in the English speaking world. Over the years, the Cathedral has witnessed many historic events, perhaps most famously the murder of Archbishop St Thomas Becket in his own cathedral on 29th December 1170 by four knights acting on the order of King Henry II.

The new statues of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh were commissioned by the Friends of Canterbury Cathedral to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of The Queen’s reign and will complement statues by the Cathedral’s West Door of Queen Victoria (the only other monarch to celebrate a Diamond Jubilee) and Prince Albert.

The royal statues have been carved by Nina Bilbey. Since 2000, Nina has specialised in stone carving and she is presently the Senior Carving Tutor at The City and Guilds Art School London. 

Commissions include statues for Hampton Court Flower Show, as well as St. Pancras Station and Saint George’s Chapel, Windsor. 

Nina has also been involved on many restoration projects across this country and abroad. Projects include The Houses of Parliament, The Royal Pavilion Brighton and Hereford Cathedral.
