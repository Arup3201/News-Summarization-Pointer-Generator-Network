You know you’re having a bad day at the office when Crystal Palace’s Joel Ward is celebrating a goal like he’s Cristiano Ronaldo.

That’s precisely what happened to hopeless Queens Park Rangers on Saturday.

Ward converted Crystal Palace’s third goal inside 42 minutes at a rampant Selhurst Park after earlier strikes from Wilfried Zaha and James McArthur.

And Such was Ward’s enthusiasm with his first goal in close to 100 appearances for the Eagles, you can perhaps forgive him for his rather cringe-worthy celebration.

Picking up the ball inside the QPR penalty area, Ward slotted the ball past Rangers stopper Rob Green with a cool left-footed strike.

The 25-year-old then sprinted off towards the corner flag before leaping up in the air and stretching his arms behind his back.

Ronaldo hasn’t played in the Premier League for the best part of six years following his mega-money move from Manchester United to Real Madrid in the summer of 2009.

But for a moment it was as if the world footballer of the year was back in England’s top flight.

It summed up an embarrassing 45 minutes from QPR who are set to be cast further adrift of Aston Villa as they, along with Burnley and Leicester City, stare at immediate relegation back to the Championship.

In contrast, Palace, flying-high under Alan Pardew, are set to move to within two points of his old team Newcastle in 11th place.

It isn’t the first time a Premier League star has mimicked one of Ronaldo’s iconic celebrations.

Earlier this season, Peter Crouch attracted much hilarity when he puffed out his chest in the same vein as the Real Madrid star after scoring in Stoke’s win against Arsenal.
