When Roberto Mancini claimed that most of Manchester City’s success under Manuel Pellegrini was as a result of players he had signed it was easy to dismiss it as sour grapes from the Italian.

But did he have a point? The spine of Pellegrini’s side which won the Premier League last season was made up of Mancini’s men and while it should be noted that executive duo Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain have their say in recruitment, the arrivals since Mancini’s departure have hardly lit up the Etihad Stadium.

Here, Sportsmail gives the verdict on each of Pellegrini’s acquisitions ahead of Saturday’s title showdown at Chelsea.

Roberto Mancini (left) guided City to the title in 2012, but the Italian was sacked the following season 

Fernandinho: £30m - Shakhtar Donetsk

At £30m, the Brazilian midfield enforcer did not come cheap. Brought in to free up Yaya Toure he played a key role in City’s title win last season as his covering presence gave his Ivorian team-mate the freedom to bang in a staggering 20 Premier League goals.

VERDICT: HIT

Fernandinho did not come cheap at £30m but the Brazilian has proved a hit since his arrival at the Etihad 

Alvaro Negredo: £20m - Sevilla

An instant hit, The Beast plundered a staggering 23 goals before the end of January. But a shoulder injury sparked a loss of form and he failed to hit the back of the net in the remainder of the campaign. After dropping below Edin Dzeko in the pecking order he was loaned to Valencia and may not be seen in the blue of City again.

VERDICT: JURY OUT

Alvaro Negredo (right) made a big impression early on at City but he has since been loaned out to Valencia  

Jesus Navas: £14.9m - Sevilla

Would appear to be liked more by his manager than the City fans. Navas has made 32 appearances already this season. In his 21 Premier League matches he has provided six assists and often gets into good positions only to be let down by his final ball.

VERDICT: MISS

Jesus Navas (right) has made 32 appearances for City this season but his final ball has been disappointing 

Martin Demichelis: £4.2m - Atletico Madrid

Struggled to adapt to the Premier League following his switch from Spain and was ridiculed by pundits including the likes of Alan Hansen. Found his feet to strike up a solid partnership with Vincent Kompany despite his advancing years and has remained a key man this year.

VERDICT: HIT

Martin Demichelis (right) struggled in his early days but has emerged as a defensive leader in the City side

Fernando: £12m - Porto

The man known as Obama for his likeness to the US president is yet to convince the Etihad electorate. Too often his midfield partnership with Fernandinho has looked lifeless and defensive. Will benefit from the return of Toure and could still prove to be a shrewd bit of business but has done little to show he is better than Javi Garcia, the man he replaced.

VERDICT: MISS

Eliaquim Mangala: £40m - Porto

Fighting off competition from Chelsea the capture of the French defender was seen as a coup. Not any more. A series of inconsistent performances have left fans scratching their heads as Mangala struggles to adapt. At £40m the bedding-in process should not be taking this long.

VERDICT: MISS

Eliaquim Mangala (left) and Bacary Sagna have both flattered to deceive in defence for City 

Bacary Sagna: Free - Arsenal

The right back has struggled to dislodge Pablo Zabaleta and has just six Premier League appearances under his belt. Although a free transfer, City had to offer him a better contract than Arsenal and he would appear to be an expensive understudy.

VERDICT: MISS

Willy Caballero had a tough afternoon in goal as City crashed to shock FA Cup defeat by Boro on Saturday 

Willy Caballero: £4.4m - Malaga

The Argentina man, a Pellegrini favourite from their time in Spain, was expected to provide real competition for Joe Hart. However, England’s No 1 has not come under great pressure and against Middlesbrough on Saturday in a rare start, Caballero was jittery and at fault for the Championship side’s opener.

VERDICT: MISS

Pellegrini’s best bit of business has arguably been the acquisition for former Chelsea stalwart Frank Lampard

Frank Lampard: Free - Chelsea

Probably Pellegrini’s best bit of business, regardless of the questions over his move from Chelsea. Evergreen Frank has scored a number of key goals this season and has often provided a creative spark lacking in City’s midfield. Pellegrini was keen to stop his planned move to New York City FC and for good reason.

VERDICT: HIT

Lampard (centre) scored the late equaliser that salvaged a 1-1 draw against old club Chelsea in September

Stevan Jovetic: £22m - Fiorentina

Was dubbed the 'Invisible Man' after he arrived thanks to a number of mystery illnesses and injuries. Has been given an opportunity to shine this season but has only shown glimpses of the talent that made him one of the hottest young properties in Europe.

VERDICT: MISS
