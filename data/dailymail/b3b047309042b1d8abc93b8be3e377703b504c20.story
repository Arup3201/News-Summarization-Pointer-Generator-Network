Erica Faith Hagan, 22, a psychology graduate from Kentucky, was dead on Saturday morning

A young American woman whose body was found in her Chile apartment may have been murdered, according to authorities.

Erica Faith Hagan, 22, a psychology graduate from Kentucky, was found with three head wounds in the bathtub of her apartment on the campus of Colegio Bautista of Temuco on Saturday morning.

She was working as an English instructor at a secondary school in Temuco, 700 kilometers (450 miles) south of Santiago.

'The investigation so far has shown that she had at least three wounds on her head that were caused by a blunt object,' said local prosecutor Cristian Paredes.

'That means we are looking at potential homicide.' 

AFP reported there were traces of a fire at the apartment. 

Miss Hagan graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky this year and went to Chile in July as a teaching assistant in English.

She had visited Chile previously and was scheduled to return home in December.

Her family were informed of her death on Sunday and are now flying out to South America. 

'This was a phenomenal, well-loved young lady that deserved better,' said Hagan's aunt, Charlene Martin.

Ms Martin says the last entry was this Friday, the same day that family members fear she may have been murdered.

In her final post she wrote about the friendliness of the Chilean people.

'God has blessed me with many people that care how I spend my time and don't want me to be lonely while I'm here,' she wrote. 

'Everyday I meet more people that invite me to be social with them and I love it! The hardest part is for me to take them up on it by asking them to keep me company during my free time.' 

Temuco is one of the country's largest cities and located near the southern boarder.

A memorial service will be held this week at Georgetown College.

Miss Hagan had been documenting her time in Chile – her second trip to the country – on her blog and in her final post she wrote about the friendliness of the Chilean people
