With the economy showing no signs of recovery, the trend for picking up stylish yet affordable clothes while doing your weekly food shop continues to gain pace.

Now, following in the footsteps of Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's, Morrisons have become the latest supermarket to branch out into the world of fashion.

The chain will launch a ‘no-nonsense’ childrenswear range Nutmeg 
in March, offering items such as toddlers' T-shirts for £2 and jeans for 
£5 across 100 of its stores.

In March last year the retailer 
appointed former Peacocks managing director Tim Bettley as its first 
director of clothing in a move to ramp up its non-food offer and give new competition to Tesco's F&F, George at Asda and Sainsbury's Tu.

Initially, Morrisons plans to focus on children's clothing and adult essentials, but it is thought they will expand if it's a success.

Bettley said: 'We want to offer a different approach from other supermarkets with simple hard-wearing fashion that is easy for customers to pick up while they are doing their food shop.

'This is a great opportunity because Morrisons' shoppers are looking for a fresh approach to supermarket fashion.'

BSc Retail Buying degree student Jemma
Gulliver has been working on the project from the outset, ordering in 
the spring/summer collection as part of a year-long work placement with
Morrisons’ supplier London-based EMA Textiles.

The
21-year-old student from De Montfort University in Leicester. said: 'It’s a very exciting time. The 
pre-production samples recently arrived on my desk.

'I started my placement working on 
different accounts but then have been working on all the contracts for 
the new Morrisons range. I oversaw the purchasing for it and 
have been making sure all the products are right and that the samples 
meet the right standard.

'It’s been really good working on this
project, it’s special. I feel really lucky to be in the placement at 
the time when Morrisons is launching this range.'

Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have all had huge successes with their respective clothing ranges and have managed to the rid the taboo of supermarket clothes shopping.

The Nutmeg range at Morrisons will be available from 21 March.
