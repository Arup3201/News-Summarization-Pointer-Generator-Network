Children are being denied full-time places at primary school after Michael Gove appeared to relax the rules

Children are being denied full-time places at primary school after Michael Gove appeared to relax the rules.

Four-year-olds had been given an automatic right to a whole day of classes.

But the Education Secretary removed a reference to providing them with 'full-time' education in last year's school admissions code.

The U-turn will cause chaos for thousands of working parents left paying for childcare or looking for shift work if schools insist on educating their children part-time.

A Department for Education source yesterday claimed policy had not changed but admitted the phrase had been axed from the foreword of the document schools refer to.

One parent is already preparing a legal challenge after a school said it would only teach her child for a few hours each day.

Dr Andrea Jarman registered her daughter Eibhlis at St Mark's Primary School in Talbot, Bournemouth, but was told she only qualified for three hours every day, either in the morning or afternoon, during the first term.

The lecturer in law at Bournemouth University was advised to find another school when she complained she could not fit her work around the timetable.

'Does Michael Gove not want more women in work, rather than having to give up their job or go part-time because they cannot get a full-time place for their child?' she said.

Jane Portman, Bournemouth Council's executive director for adults and children's services, told The Observer: 'The council supports parents' right to choose to place their child in full-time education at the start of the reception year.

'Unfortunately, Department for Education regulations are not clear about the requirements on schools to make such an offer. The council is therefore seeking further clarification on how the regulation should be applied.

' Labour introduced the guarantee for full-time education for four-year-olds in 2009 under the then Education Secretary Ed Balls.

Details of the way schools are 
interpreting the admissions code emerged as Department for Education 
figures showed record numbers of young children are being taught in 
classes of 31 or more.

Nearly 72,000 five to seven-year-olds are now in large classes, up from 31,265 in 2010.Over the past year alone numbers have soared from 47,290 to 71,935.

Mr Gove axed a rule that stated classes could only have more than 30 pupils for a maximum of one year.

Schools are struggling to cope with a sustained baby boom and around 120,000 children are expected to be without a primary school place in September according to an analysis by Labour.

The National Audit Office has warned that number will double to 240,000 by next year.

Education experts say capital funding for schools has been cut while a third of free schools, which are state funded but independently run, are being allowed to open in areas with a surplus of places.Local authorities have been looking into the possibility of renting space in closed stores, warehouses and police stations to be used as temporary classrooms.

Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg accused Mr Gove of 'presiding over an education crisis'.'There is a huge shortfall in school places and now class sizes are rising again,' he said.

Mr Gove said: 'Labour cut 200,000 primary places, slashed the amount spent on areas of population growth and let immigration soar - and all this in the middle of a baby boom.

'The coalition government has, however, taken swift action to repair the damage. We have more than doubled funding for new school places.'

A Department for Education spokeswoman said: 'Every child has the right to a full-time school place in the September following their fourth birthday.'
