This is the horrifying moment the body of a dying woman is dragged along the road, hanging from the back of a police car.

Claudia Silva Ferreira was hit in crossfire during an alleged exchange of bullets between police and traffickers in Morro da Congonha favela in Madurai, Rio de Janeiro, on Sunday morning.

The innocent 38-year-old mother of four, who had gone out to buy bread for her family, was alive when her body was allegedly 'thrown like a piece of meat' into the boot of the police car by three officers who have since been arrested.

Her body fell out of the vehicle and was left hanging on just by her clothing. She was dragged along for 250 metres before officers stopped.

Footage of her body being dragged along the road by a police car was taken as officers transported her to the nearest hospital.

According to her son, his mother was alive and shaking her head when she was put into the boot of the car. Police protocol states that an injured person should be accompanied on the back seat.
