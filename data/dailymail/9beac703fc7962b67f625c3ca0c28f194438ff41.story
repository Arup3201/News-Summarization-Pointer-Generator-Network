Spy: 8,000 hidden cameras like this one photograph the cars on Britain's roads 26 million times every day

Police are recording 26million images of motorists every day – an increase of 61 per cent since 2012, it emerged yesterday.

Senior officers say the system is invaluable in preventing and solving serious crime and terror attacks.

But civil liberty campaigners warn that it is intrusive and lacks oversight.

The images are taken on a network of around 8,000 automatic numberplate recognition (ANPR) cameras across the UK.

In 2012, 16million images were recorded every day by cameras – many of them unmarked – which are positioned on motorways and A and B roads.

Each time a vehicle passes, a camera takes a picture of the vehicle’s numberplate and another of the front of the car, including the driver’s face.

The cameras are operated by individual police forces but the records are stored  on a national database of 17 billion  images, used by police and intelligence services to track criminals.

However, it  also contains the records of innocent motorists, showing a detailed map of their daily journeys.

Police refuse to reveal the locations of the cameras, saying to do so would undermine the effectiveness of the system.

It is thought that by 2018, between 50 million and 75 million pictures of vehicles will be taken every day.

The network of cameras is already so extensive that it allows police forces to track where vehicles have gone every single day.

Pictures can be checked against the Police National Computer and used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in the battle against crime.

The first cameras were installed in Britain on the M1 in 1984 to spot stolen vehicles.

By 2005, the number of cameras had increased to 2,000 and there are now more than 8,000.

As well as fixed cameras, police forces use mobile units - with more than 100 in London alone.

Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said the technology is being secretly rolled out without the public's knowledge.

'ANPR is a classic example of a very intrusive technology being rolled out with zero public debate.

'The public hasn't been given even the most basic information about what information is being recorded, how long it is kept or who is able to access it.

'When you consider the system allows every journey to be tracked, down to the second, and for someone to search through the entire log of when your car was scanned and where, it is without doubt an extremely intrusive system.

'How many people would have said yes if they had been asked to install a device on their car so the police could monitor their journeys? Yet this is exactly what ANPR technology allows.

'It is a total failure of law and oversight if this massive yet secretive expansion of ANPR systems is legal.'

Julian Blazeby, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: 'Given the nature of ANPR it is understandable that some will be concerned about how this data is used.

'ANPR has only ever been for the prevention and detection of crime as well as locating vulnerable people with the intent of preserving life.

'It has saved lives, brought serious, violent offenders to justice and is used in the detection of would-be terrorists. It’s not about tracking every vehicle’s journey – which is an exaggeration of ANPR’s capabilities.

'Currently we have an average of 7,750 active cameras within any seven day period and an average daily read of 26 million.

'However an increase to 50 or 75 million is not anticipated at this time and there are no current plans for a mass roll out of ANPR cameras.

'The database consists of approximately 17 billion records. This data is owned by the chief officers of law enforcement agencies who act as data controllers.'

Police forces want to share the information harvested by the cameras with countries across Europe.

A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'ANPR is a vital tool and we support its use where it is legitimate and proportionate.

'We have created a new, independent post of surveillance camera commissioner to help oversee this.

'These cameras may only be located where there is an identified need to detect, deter, and disrupt criminality. Any new ANPR camera deployment will also require a privacy impact assessment.'
