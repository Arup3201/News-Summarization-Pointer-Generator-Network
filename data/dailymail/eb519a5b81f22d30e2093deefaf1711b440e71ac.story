The brother of EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie confessed to killing her in a letter to their father - but insisted he was 'not evil'.

Tony McCluskie, 36, lied that he could not remember battering his sister to death at their east London home, butchering her body and dumping the parts in a nearby canal.

In a letter he sent to his father Anthony from Highdown Prison in Surrey, the murderer wrote that he 'wouldn't hurt a fly' and 'would do anything for the family'.

But Anthony and Ms McCluskie's other brother, Danny, said they could never forgive him for what he did.

They also revealed that innocent Danny and his best friend were questioned over the sick crime.

McCluskie killed his sister on March 1 last year after an argument over his cannabis use at their house in Shoreditch.

He then chopped up her body with knives and a meat cleaver, packed it in a suitcase and threw it into Regent's Canal.

The 36-year-old then lied to the police about what had happened, joining in the search for the 29-year-old along with friends, family and stars including Martine McCutcheon.

But his letter to his 61-year-old father, seen by The Sun, contains an admission of guilt - although McCluskie maintains he cannot remember what had happened.

Until then, the killer had lied to everyone and even denied being the murderer to Anthony's face with his father visited him in jail before the trial.

He came clean a day after sending the confession letter, Anthony revealed.

The letter reads: 'Dad you know me well enough to know that I'm not an evil person and it wasn't me that done such a terrible thing.

'It chokes me up knowing I did. I wish I could tell you more and I sit here day and night thinking non-stop, but I just can't remember what happened that day.

'I've always been the quiet one, the one that wouldn't hurt a fly, the one that would do anything for our family. I just hope you can forgive me.'

McCluskie adds that he is broken-hearted to have hurt people and cannot believe what he has done, before signing off with six kisses.

But a grieving Anthony said his son's actions had been disgusting and that he deserved to be in jail.

He said his daughter had told him that McCluskie was becoming violent in the months before the murder.

On one occasion, he put his hands around her neck and on another, he slapped her around the face.

She had said he was getting out of control and taking too many drugs.

Anthony said he tortures himself by vividly imagining what happened that day and does not think his son will ever tell him the truth.

While he will not abandon his son, he added, he will never forgive him.

Brother Danny said he never wanted to see his sibling again, and had also been lied to by his brother on the one occasion he visited the prison.

He said he watched the CCTV footage of McCluskie dragging the suitcase full of body parts towards the canal ten times.

Danny relived telling their mother Pauline about Ms McCluskie's death while she was in hospital after having a benign brain tumour removed.

He said a single tear ran down her face and she repeatedly mouthed the word 'no', unable to speak because of the operation.

At doctors' advice, the family only told her the shocking truth about McCluskie's involvement months later.

Sentencing McCluskie to a minimum of 20 years behind bars at the Old Bailey on Wednesday, Mr Justice Fulford told McCluskie he was responsible for an ‘utterly cold-blooded and determined’ killing.

He said the window cleaner was driven to kill by his addiction and resentment over living with his ‘hugely popular and outgoing’ sister.

The judge said the crime was ‘extremely grave’ and made worse by McCluskie’s attempts to conceal her body and point the finger of blame at others.

The actress, who worked part-time as a barmaid, enjoyed success as Kerry Skinner in the BBC soap in 2000, at the age of 17. In contrast, her brother drifted between manual jobs, most recently as a window cleaner on high-rise buildings.

McCluskie spent most of the time in his room, smoking up to 15 cannabis joints and drinking up to ten pints of lager, fortified with shots of tequila, every day.

Gemma was killed after returning from the opening of the new Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel. Earlier in the day friends heard her ringing McCluskie to tell him she was sick of his cannabis habit and he would have to move out.

When she arrived in the afternoon of March 1 last year, she discovered he had left the bathroom taps running and flooded the bathroom. Neighbours heard her sobbing before McCluskie repeatedly shouted: ‘I’m sorry Gemma, I must have been out of my mind.’ 

For four days he acted as the concerned brother, even posing for photographs with an appeal poster. And in a chilling ruse, McCluskie texted his sister, pretending he did not know she was dead. He signed off one message with ‘love ya xxx’.

Police analysed his messages and discovered it was the only  time he had ever told his sister he loved her.

Carol McCluskie, Gemma's stepmother and Anthony's wife, said: 'I have watched my husband slowly become a broken man.

'There has always been laughter in our house but now it is very rare. '
