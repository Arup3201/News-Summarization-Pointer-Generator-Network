Speaking at North Wales Police HQ in

into Catherine Gowing’s disappearance has developed.

'We can now confirm that, having 
carefully carried out a detailed review of the evidence gathered so far,
we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence to charge Clive 
Sharpe with the murder of Catherine Gowing and it is in the public 
interest to do so.

'Accordingly we have authorised North
Wales Police to charge the defendant and he will appear before Mold 
Magistrates tomorrow morning.
'This is an extremely serious criminal charge and the police investigation continues.'

Miss Gowing's burned-out car found in abandoned in a country lane, police confirmed yesterday

Ms Gowing, 37, has been missing since
she failed to arrive at work at the Evans Veterinary Practice in Mold, 
North Wales, on Monday.

North
Wales Police said today that a five-door Renault Clio found last night 
in Pinfold Lane, Alltami, near Mold, had been identified as the missing 
woman’s car.

Failed to arrive: Ms Gowing has been missing since she did not arrive at work at the Evans Veterinary Practice in Mold, North Wales on Monday

Abandoned: The torched and abandoned car was found just two miles from Ms Gowing's home in New Brighton, Flintshire

Catherine's car: Police have appealed to anyone with information about Ms Gowing or her car (pictured) to contact police immediately to help relieve 'the pain that Catherine's friends and family are going through'

Confirming the news, Detective 
Superintendent John Hanson appealed to anyone with information about Ms 
Gowing or the car to contact police immediately to help relieve ‘the 
pain that Catherine’s friends and family are going through’.

The car was found at about 7.15pm yesterday just two miles from Ms Gowing’s home after a member of the public contacted police.

A 46-year-old man from Gwynedd, known
to Ms Gowing, remains in police custody on suspicion of murder after 
being arrested on Tuesday night.

Detective Superintendent John Hanson 
said today: ‘Following an appeal for information regarding the 
whereabouts of Catherine Gowing’s Renault Clio motor vehicle, at about 
7.15pm yesterday evening a member of the public contacted police 
regarding the discovery of a burnt-out car in Pinfold Lane, Alltami, 
near Mold.'

Ms Gowing, from New Brighton, Flintshire was last seen on Friday night at a supermarket in Queensferry, Flintshire. A broken text message was sent from her mobile phone to one of her work colleagues that evening. Officers have been scouring CCTV and carrying out a forensic examination of her home as they try to establish her whereabouts.

Emotional plea: Ms Gowing's distraught sister Emma Gowing asked the public for help in tracking down her 'beautiful sister'

Appearing at a press conference yesterday, Ms Gowing’s distraught sister Emma Gowing asked the public for help in tracking down her 'beautiful sister', whom she described as the 'light of my life'.

‘Please look, please search, please help us find our beautiful sister,' she said. 'Catherine is a kind, sensitive beautiful person. She’s passionate about animals and utterly devoted to my family.

'She’s my best friend, she’s the light of my life and she’s the light of my parents’ life.

'If you have any information about Catherine, no matter how trivial you think it is, please contact the police.'

David Evans, owner of the veterinary practice where Ms Gowing has been based for 18 months, said staff became worried after receiving the text at the weekend.

'One of the nurses was concerned about her on Saturday or Sunday because she had half a message from her, from her mobile phone anyway,' Mr Evans said.

'We thought, since her car was missing, we thought maybe she had gone somewhere for the weekend or got into some difficulty or something like that.'

Ms Gowing is known to have missed a weekend appointment but the alarm was not raised until Monday morning when she failed to arrive at work.

'We informed the police as soon as she 
did not turn up for work at 9 o’clock on Monday morning. Then we left it
to the police,' Mr Evans added.

Police believe she drove home to in her work car, a Vauxhall Corsa, which was recovered earlier.

Police were yesterday granted a 
36-hour extension to question the suspect, who is known to frequent the 
New Brighton area and is known to Ms Gowing.

She was last seen at Asda in Queensferry at 8.06pm on Friday and left at 8.39pm.

She was wearing blue jeans, a light brown/khaki zip-up fleece top with white sleeves and white side panels, and plain black flat shoes. Her brown hair was tied up.

Ms Gowing was also carrying a bright brown saddle bag over her shoulder and across her body and was carrying an Asda plastic bag and a pizza-type box.

Detective Superintendent John Hanson said: Our priority is to trace Catherine and we would urge anyone who has seen her to contact the North Wales Police incident room on 101.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
