A shipwreck discovered off the Isles of Scilly is thought to be a legendary vessel belonging to Sir Walter Raleigh - which sank as he searched for the 'Lost City Of Gold'.

The stricken 50ft boat called Flying Joan set sail in 1617 from Plymouth in Devon towards the West Indies.

It was part of a fleet led by Raleigh looking for the mythical riches of El Dorado - but was scuttled by a huge storm and sank without a trace.

Diver Robin Burrows explores the newly discovered wreck of a ship believed to have been sailed by Sir Walter Raleigh

The shipwreck uncovered off the Isles of Scilly is believed to have been lost when a storm scattered his vessels as they headed for the West Indies

Sir Walter Raleigh's missing ship from his mission to find El Dorado may have been found

The 120 tonne ship has languished on the ocean floor for nearly 400 years.

But divers now say they have found it off the coast of the Scilly Isles.

Its sunken timber frame was found by divers in 50ft of water along with Tudor guns and fragments of ancient pottery. 

The stricken vessel was never located but local divers Todd Stevens and Robin Burrows have now asked English Heritage to confirm their find.

Mr Stevens has nicknamed the 50ft wreck Lizzy and says photos and artefacts prove it is Raleigh's ship.

He said: 'Since we first found the 
Lizzy, I have always said that the evidence we have on the seabed leads 
me to believe it to be the wreck of an armed pinnace.

'This would be a small, single-masted ship without a bowsprit and consequently a gun in the bow instead.

'The ship Sir Walter Raleigh lost here in a storm in 1617 was indeed an armed pinnace. The wreck fits in age and style.'

The Flying Joan, captained by John 
Chindley, was known to have sunk off Scilly on June 12, 1617 as it 
departed the West Country, led by Raleigh's 440-tonne The Destiny.

Diver Todd Stevens holds a piece of the shipwreck. The wreck, which has been named the Lizzy by the divers who discovered it, is thought to have possibly sunk in 1617 and been one of two ships lost out of a fleet of 30 shortly after they left Plymouth

Diver Robin Burrows believes the ship could have been the Flying Joan, one of the fleet on one of the last voyages led by Sir Walter Raleigh before he was executed at the Palace of Westminster in 1618

In the sixteenth century, explorer Sir Walter Raleigh set sail in search of El Dorado - the legendary city full of gold and precious jewels.

In 1594 Raleigh made the first of two expeditions in search of El Dorado.

During the second he was accompanied by his son Watt who was killed during the adventure in 1617.

In 1772 Scientist Alexander von Humboldt and botanist Aimé Bonpland voyaged to South America to once and for all prove or dispel the myth of El Dorado.

When they return to Europe they spread their belief, that the city was nothing more than a dream of the early conquistadors.

The fleet of 30 was ships scattered by a storm shortly after setting sail and two ships sank - including the Flying Joan.

Little is known about the fate of the Flying Joan's 25 crew members, although historical records show Chindley made it to the West Indies on board another ship.

The expedition was Raleigh's second failed attempt to find a 'City of Gold' somewhere between Trinidad and the north east coast of Venezuela.

But his men later ransacked a Spanish outpost and Raleigh was arrested upon his return and executed in 1618 to appease the Spanish.

The process of discovering the Lizzy, named for its guns dating to the late Tudor period, began in 2008 when Mr Stevens and his team conducted a magnetometer survey around the islands to detect anomalies.
