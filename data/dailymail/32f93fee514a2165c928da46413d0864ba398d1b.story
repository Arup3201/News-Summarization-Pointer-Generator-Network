Confession: Forsythia Owen allegedly told police she beat Denzle Rainey to death

A 30-year-old woman has been arrested after she confessed to police she beat a homeless man to death with a baseball bat.

Forsythia Owen claimed she attacked Denzle Rainey in an alleyway where he had been sleeping rough because he allegedly molested her four-year-old daughter.

As she was interviewed by police Owens, of Englewood, Colorado, allegedly swung her arms repeatedly as she demonstrated how she delivered the fatal blows.

Mr Rainey was found in the alley with serious injuries. He had a cracked skull, broken ribs and vital organs had been damaged.

A post-mortem examination showed his broken ribs had cut into his liver, Fox 13 reported.

The 42-year-old had been living rough while he tried to patch up his relationship with his wife and children.

Owens, who was arrested on Monday, is being held in Arapahoe County Detention Center and is facing first-degree murder charges, according to 9 News.

She allegedly said to officers that the unnamed child told her Mr Rainey had sexually abused her.

Police are investigating Owen's claims that he molested her daughter.

When police asked if she was responsible for the man's death, the mother: 'Stood up and said she killed him,' according to an affidavit seen by the Denver Channel.

'Owen swung her hands back and forth and demonstrated how she struck Rainey over and over again because of what he did to [name redacted],' the document stated.

The mother allegedly told police that after hearing that Mr Rainey was sleeping in an alley, she sought him out and attacked while he was still sleeping.

Evidence: Police have marked out the area near a garage where Mr Rainey was found

Troubled: Denzle had recently moved out of the home he shared with his wife and children

She claimed he was still breathing when she left him in the alley.

Mr Rainey's injuries were so severe his wife said she struggled to recognize him when she visited in hospital shortly before his death.

'It didn't look like my husband cause his head was so beaten,' Lisa Rainey, who lives in Denver, said. She added that she doubted claims that her husband had molested a child.

'I just don’t know why, what caused her to do this on Denzel, and if Denzel did anything to provoke it,' Mrs Rainey told CBS Denver. 'I need to know the answers for closure for me and closure for my kids.'

The couple had been going through a rough patch, and Mr Rainey had recently left the family home as he struggled to deal with drink problems.

Claims: Denzle Rainey, seen here on his 41st birthday, was accused of child abuse by Owens. Police are investigating her allegations but his family deny he had done anything to hurt anybody

Posts on his Facebook page in recent months show the desperate father was trying to seek help at rehabilitation centers.

With low self-esteem he had posted several comments, including one just days before he was killed, saying he wanted to take his own life.

On September 14 he wrote that he had 'lost everything' then posted: 'I'm going to take pills and drink untell [sic] i don't wake up no moore [sic].'

A few days later, on September 17, he appeared in a more positive mood as he asked Facebook friends to help him find somewhere to stay while he waited to return to rehab.

And, by September 19, he wrote: 'im still here and doing ok for now'.

But, just a couple of days later, he was beaten to death.

His recent ups and downs led the mother of his three children to leave a post on his Facebook page explaining that her husband had not taken his own life, but had been killed.

According to CBS Denver Owen, who is being held without bond, has been arrested previously on assault charges.
