The mother of a San Francisco-based freelance writer has received a credit card offer in the mail, ostensibly addressed to her daughter, but with one significant difference.

The Bank of America sent an offer to one 'Lisa Is A Slut McIntire' for a $100 cash-back bonus if she signed up for a Bank Americard Cash Rewards Visa credit card.

Her bemused mother, who chose a much more conventional middle name for her daughter, sent a text message to McIntire, telling her, 'Interesting piece of junk mail addressed to you. "Lisa is a slut McIntire."'

Her daughter was understandably confused. 'Uh, what?' she responded.

McIntire tweeted a picture of the offensive envelope to the Bank of America Help account and received a response around 5:30pm Thursday saying that the bank is looking into the insulting piece of advertising.

'We’re incredibly sorry this happened and are researching now so we can take the appropriate action,' the bank's account tweeted at her.

Those of us who have never been insulted by an envelope may be horrified at the slight, but Lisa McIntire is taking it as a blessing in disguise.

'February 6, 2014: the day my personal brand finally hit it big!' she tweeted, adding that her mother couldn't be prouder.

McIntire says she racked her brains to think if there was anyone she had inadvertantly offended at the Bank of America who could be reponsible for the gaffe.

'Not that I know of!' she told New York Magazines' Daily Intelligencer.

She said the letter had 'initially made me nervous because I'm a feminist writer on the internet, but I don’t think it's personal.'

McIntire's Twitter followers speculated on how the letter came to be addressed in such as fashion.

'Some poor data-entry clerk had a really rough break-up with his girlfriend Lisa (the slut),' suggested one.

Another told McIntire that despite the aspersions cast upon her character by the bank, he is impressed with her fiscal management.

'Are you single? Your creditworthiness, among other things, is a turn on,' he tweeted.

Another mail-out error recently saw a grieving father, whose daughter was killed in a car accident, receive a letter from Office Max addressed to 'Mike Seay, Daughter Killed in Car Crash.'

The devastated father was disturbed not just by the envelope but the fact that the company would possess personal information about him.

‘What purpose does it serve anybody to know that? And how much other types of other information do they have if they have that on me, or anyone else? And how do they use that, what do they use that for?’ he asked.
