Linda Leann Wallace, 53, has been sentenced to 16 years in a Texas prison for the relationship with her student

A 53-year-old teacher and mother who had a sexual relationship with a female student lasting four years has been jailed for 16 years.

Linda Leann Wallace, of Texas, was given the lengthy sentence despite her daughter telling the court:'My mom is not a predator.'

Wallace, 53, began the inappropriate relationship when the student was 13 years old.

The 16 year sentence is one of the harshest ever handed down by a court for a teacher involved in an inappropriate relationship.

A court in Beaumont, Texas, was told the affair continued for four years and the pair would meet at her home, on campus and during school trips.

The affair ended when he teen graduated from the Legacy Christian Academy where Wallace worked as a music teacher.

Wallace had pleaded guilty to engaging with an underage student in July. She was arrested in 2012 after police were tipped off about the affair.

Her daughter had spoken on her mom’s behalf telling the court her mom was not a sexual predator.

Wallace also spoke in her own defense saying she was sorry for her actions.

'I've had remorse for many years.  I'm terribly sorry.  I cry myself to sleep at night for her innocence,' said Wallace.

'We knew it was wrong. The only reason it evolved to that point was because she was struggling with her family. 

'I wanted so hard to be there for the student and encourage her. I should have stood my ground.  I'm sincerely sorry.'

In a victim impact statement the female student, who has not been named, said she forgave Wallace - but told here 'there must be consequences.'

The victim said: 'I don't wish anything bad on you. I just wanted to do the right thing. I am deeply saddened by what took place.

'I was seeking a motherly figure. I trusted you so much. I was robbed spiritually, emotionally, physically, and mentally.

'I was afraid of that happening to someone else. The enemy had silenced me for a good portion of my life.

'But, today I shed light. I'm not going to be silent anymore. I'm not angry with you. This is not the end for you. I completely forgive you. But, there must be consequences.'

Prosecutors said Wallace faced between two to 20 years in jail.

Prosecutors said the student's family is 'severely traumatized' by the relationship because Wallace was also a family friend.

Wallace's attorney, Paul Fukuda,said:  'It's a tragedy for both families. Ms. Wallace is taking full responsibility.'
