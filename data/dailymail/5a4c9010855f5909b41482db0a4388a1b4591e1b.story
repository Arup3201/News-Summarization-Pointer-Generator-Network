A hungry police officer parked his patrol car on double yellow lines in a cycle lane - so he could buy a pork bun.

The armed officer pulled over in the narrow road near London's Borough Market in his BMW X5 and left his car parked illegally before queuing to buy a sandwich at a cafe under the railway arches nearby.

The officer, who wore body armour and had his gun clearly strapped to his leg as he waited in line, is thought to have ordered a BBQ pulled pork bap.

The incident took place yesterday lunchtime at Hobbs Meat Roast just south of the Thames in London, a city where 4million parking fines are handed out each year.

Chris Thomson, an office worker in London Bridge, captured the armed officer’s brazen behaviour after he saw the car parked illegally and assumed an urgent police operation was taking place nearby.

He said: 'Upon seeing a Met Police BMW X5 slowly parking up on both a cycle lane and double yellow lines, I thought there must be some sort of incident to which the officers inside were attending.

'I stopped briefly just to see if 
anything was going down, but one of the officers casually hopped out 
smiling and proceeded to walk into Borough Market.

'I
thought he might be responding to something involving one of the market
stalls, but was shocked to see him simply saunter up to buy his lunch.

'As
someone who’s had to fork out £65 for a parking fine in London when I 
was just a few minutes over the time, I think it displays shocking 
double standards that the police can get away with this sort of thing.'

The Hobbs Roast Meat stall which the 
police officer visited is a popular haunt in the food-lovers' market. 

Set up by former market trader Michael Hobbs and his wife Julie, it 
offers hot meat rolls, buns and baguettes, with popular items including a
pulled pork bun and a beef sandwich wrap.
