Tragic: Avery Lane died at age six from complications from influenza

A Maine mother whose six-year-old daughter died of influenza is facing heartbreak all over again after her little girl's grave was vandalized three times - including twice in two days this week.

Avery Lane's parents adorned her final resting place in Fairfield, Maine, with a colorful pinwheel, wind chimes and other small tributes to the child they lost in December 2012. A small bench also sits beside her headstone, where her family can sit and visit the grave site.

Detectives are now investigating whether Avery's grave was targeted because the lovingly decorated site, which is in a Quaker cemetery, isn't in line with the Quaker tradition of simplicity, Fairfield Police Chief Thomas Gould confirmed to MailOnline.

The wider community has responded with outrage over the vandalism and has raised $1,800 for a reward to help catch the vandals.

'It’s
 the grave of a young child. It’s seen as a heartless thing. People are 
upset because this woman lost her child at a very young age and then has to go through this,' Chief Gould said.

The Portland Press Herald
 reports that on Sunday night, Kennebec County Sheriff's Deputy Jacob 
Pierce stopped by Avery's grave and found that it had been disturbed.

The wind chime had been knocked down and broken and the pinwheel had been removed.

Deputy Pierce
 told the Press Herald that he was working on December 11, 2012 when 
Avery's father called police that she was having respiratory problems 
from the flu. The first grader died in Deputy Pierce's arms.

The deputy, who
 just returned from an eight-month tour in Afghanistan with the Nation 
Guard, said he sobbed when he found the damage to the little girl's grave site.

Avery's
 mother, Tabitha Souzer, 
replaced the broken items Monday. When she went back that night, she 
discovered her daughter's grave had been vandalized once again.

Adorned: Avery's parents decorated her grave as a tribute to the daughter they lost so young

It was also disturbed last year - making Monday's attack the third time vandal's defiled Avery's final resting place.

No other graves in the Friends Cemetery of Fairfield are decorated with toys or trinkets and no other grave sites were disturbed, the Press Herald reports.

The plot belongs to the family but they have no affiliation to the church.

MailOnline could not reach anyone at Friends Cemetery of Fairfield or at the Fairfield Friends Meeting for comment.

Paul Cates, a former Quaker minister in a neighboring town told the Press Herald that the colorful decorations weren't in keeping with Quaker values.

'We don’t have anything like that in our cemetery,' Mr Cates said.

'The idea of decorating with pinwheels and toys and stuff like that is not in the tradition of the Friends.'

Chief Gould told MailOnline that his investigators were looking into the possibility that grave was targeted by Quakers upset by the decorations.

He said his detectives were following leads and expects to announce a break in the case on Friday. 

The Friends of Fairfield Cemetery has no other graves that are decorated. The Quakers generally believe in living a simple, unadorned life
