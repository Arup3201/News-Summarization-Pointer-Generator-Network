Steve Bruce could be the man to end Alan Pardew’s four-year tenure at Newcastle United — and is keen on replacing him if the position becomes vacant.

The atmosphere turned toxic at St Mary’s as Pardew watched his team crumble against Southampton to leave them bottom of the table and without a win in their first four league games.

Owner Mike Ashley was in the stands to witness his club’s diabolical performance and could hear the away fans turn on Pardew and constantly call for his head.

Hull manager Steve Bruce is keen on replacing Alan Pardew if the position becomes vacant

Sources close to the Newcastle boss indicated he was in the dark about his future at the club yesterday, but Pardew hosts Hull at St James’ Park on Saturday when there will be no let-up from the home supporters and defeat could spell the end.

Tensions will already be high. It is the first time Pardew has been on the touchline against Hull since he headbutted their midfielder David Meyler last season. That earned him a seven-match ban from the FA and a £100,000 fine from Newcastle.

Hull boss Bruce remained coy on the possibility of taking over at Newcastle, the club he supports, but it is understood he is interested in the job if Pardew is sacked.

Newcastle fans have never really taken to Alan Pardew and are now calling for his head

Bruce said: ‘After what happened to me at Sunderland I know how difficult the North East is. I have only been at Hull a couple of years and they have been really good. They gave me the chance to get up and running again and for that I will always be grateful.’

On Saturday, Southampton were as good as Newcastle were bad. New signing Graziano Pelle scored a header and tap-in in the opening 20 minutes which set the travelling supporters on Pardew’s back.

Goals from Jack Cork, who had never scored a league goal in three years at the club, and Morgan Schneiderlin, in second-half stoppage time, finished them off.

The travelling supporters who made a 660-mile round trip unfurled banners saying ‘Pardew is a Muppet’ and ‘Pardew Out’. Pardew famously signed an eight-year contract with Newcastle just under two years ago, having led them to fifth place in the 2011-12 season. 

He told Sky Sports: ‘It is not easy to digest and not easy for the players either to play under those circumstances, so we have to be strong and try to tough it out this week and come back next week.

‘We just have to put ourselves on the line, really, and be brave. Certainly, we have a bit more quality than we showed today, for sure, and we need to get that on the pitch.’

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman said: ‘I understand how difficult the situation is for them, and for their manager. They have qualities, they showed that as well, and for that reason it was a great result for us.’

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley handed Alan Pardew an eight-year contract less than two years ago

Newcastle legend Alan Shearer admitted Pardew is under huge pressure. He said: ‘Results have not been good enough since January.

‘From the first minute, Southampton went after Newcastle and they could not cope. Having said all that, I am led to believe they spent nearly £40million but that the manager does not have a say in that. Inevitably, in the long run, that does not work.’

The last time Newcastle failed to win their first four league games was in 2005 under Graeme Souness. By February that season, he was gone.
