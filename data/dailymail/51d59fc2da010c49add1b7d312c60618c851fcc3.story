Australian ambulance officials warned iPhone owners today to be careful how they handle their devices after a Sydney woman was taken to hospital when she allegedly received an electric shock from her device.

The incident follows what ambulance authorities said were hundreds of emergency calls for mobile phone shocks between January and June this year.

Earlier this month the family of a Chinese woman said she had died after receiving an electric shock from her iPhone when she was using it while it was charging.

The Apple initiative will take place from August 16 to October 18. Anyone who wants to take up the offer will have to provide the serial number of their iPhone, iPad or iPod, and hand over a USB charger

In the latest Australian incident, a woman in her 20s, from the Sydney suburb of Chatswood, was taken by ambulance to the Royal North Shore Hospital in a stable condition after allegedly receiving a shock from her iPhone.

It is not known whether the phone was plugged into a charger at the time, but a spokeswoman said paramedics had responded to a number of shocks from mobile phone chargers this year.

New South Wales Ambulance has attended 232 emergency calls for electric shocks in the first six months of this year, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported.

The spokeswoman said mobile phone users should keep an eye on their phone's connection.

'If the appliances are dusty, they should be given a vacuum clean,' she said, suggesting that dust could get into the terminals and cause a short circuit.

Inspector John Brotherhood of the ambulance service warned that a slight shock could cause serious health problems.

Tragic: Ma Ailun, 23, a former flight attendant with China Southern Airlines, died when she picked up her iPhone as it charged at home, her family said.

'It takes only a small shock to interfere with your heart,' he said.

'Basically, if the jolt moves you, if it takes your breath away or if it's at all a cause for concern, you need to get it' - referring to a person's health and also the phone - 'checked out.'

Earlier this month air stewardess Ma Ailun was killed by an 
electric shock when she answered a call on her iPhone 5 while it was 
recharging, it was claimed yesterday.

News
 of the death of  23-year-old was posted on the internet by her sister,
 prompting criticism of Apple among the country’s millions of iPhone 
users.

‘I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging,’ her sister wrote.

Miss Ma, who was due to marry in 
August, was said to have bought her iPhone 5 in December from an 
official store in her home town in Xinjiang province.

Her  brother told a Hong Kong newspaper the phone had been handed to Chinese authorities for examination.

Miss Ma's brother, Yuelun, told Apple
 Daily that the family believe she died from an electric shock while 
answering a call and that the phone and its accessories have been handed
 over to the Chinese authorities.

Her sister then wrote on social networking site Weibo: 'I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging.'

She said Ma had bought the iPhone in December at an official Apple store 
and was using the original charger to recharge the phone when the 
incident occurred.

Apple, said it had launched a 'thorough 
investigation', adding: 'We are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic 
incident and offer our condolences to the family.

'We will fully investigate and co-operate with authorities in this matter.'

This warning also comes after Chinese man Wu
 Jiantong reportedly fell into a coma after suffering an electric shock as he plugged in his 
iPhone 4 to charge.

He collapsed at around 10pm on Monday after connecting his iPhone
 4 to a charger at home in Beijing. He'd had the phone for two years.

'He
 shouted 'electric shock' and then fell to the floor,' Wu's sister told 
Xinhua news agency, adding that she felt a slight shock herself when she
 tried to unplug the faulty charger, which she said was not official 
Apple hardware.

An 
Apple spokesman said: 'It was with great sadness we learned through 
press reports that a Beijing customer was injured while using a "knock 
off" or counterfeit charger and we are looking into this further. 

'Our
 customers' safety is very important to us and we have carefully 
designed all Apple products to meet government safety standards. We 
recommend our customers only purchase Apple products from Apple or 
authorized Apple resellers.'
