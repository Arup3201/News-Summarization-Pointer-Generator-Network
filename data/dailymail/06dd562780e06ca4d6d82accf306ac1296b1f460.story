Sir Charles Barkley - the French bulldog - has become an internet sensation with more than 100,000 Instagram followers with pictures posted online daily of him in ridiculous poses in random locations.

The adorable dog, named after the former basketball star, whose nickname was the Round Mound of Rebound, has been racking up fans since the first day his owners Melissa and Paul Canda took pictures of their pet.

After friends showed their delight after seeing the pictures of Barkley, from Seattle, Washington, the pair decided to set him up with his own account.

And soon after the bulldog, became such a star he already has more than 900 pictures on his account.

Barkley
 has been shot with ice cream, in shirts, playing on a swing, with a 
beer and, just like his namesake, even wearing some very trendy 
basketball gear.

Mrs Canda,

French bulldogs around - we thought they were an adorable breed.

‘Barkley was the smallest boy in his litter so he was perfect. We also love their temperament and how friendly they are.

‘We
 started taking pictures of him the first day we met him at the 
breeder's and visited every two weeks until we were able to take him 
home.

‘We didn't want to 
overflow our own Instagram accounts with his pics so we decided to just 
start his own. That way if our family and friends wanted to see him 
every day they were able to.’

Mr
 Canda, 31, said: ‘A lot of his pictures are just things he does daily 
or impromptu - he's still a stubborn bulldog so to get him to pose with 
something takes treats, toys and patience.

‘When
 Barkley's in his lazy mood, we lay him on his back, take a picture and 
then turn that picture upside down so it looks like he has a funny grin 
on his face.

‘We're 
surprised every day with the response he has received. Barkley has 
opened up doors and introduced us to people we would never have known on
 our own.

‘Barkley's been 
posting on Instagram since he was just a couple weeks old and we never 
imagined him getting as many followers as he has today.

‘It has really turned into a fun hobby for us and we've made some great friends through Instagram.

‘We
 love all the kind and sweet comments from people all over the world and
 it's really what keeps us going. No matter what though, he's still our 
furry family member and we love and spoil him to death.’
