Parents at a primary school are up in arms over a plan to send pupils home at lunchtime every Friday to let teachers catch up on paperwork.

The move would mean children losing the equivalent of 16 days of education every year.

Families are furious at the threat to their youngsters’ schooling, and also the prospect of having to pay for extra childcare.

Controversial: Cottesbrooke Junior, in Acocks Green, Birmingham, proposes to close on Friday afternoons so teachers can catch up on paperwork

From January, the 355 pupils at 
Cottesbrooke Junior School in Acocks Green, Birmingham, will be sent 
home at lunchtime every Friday.

More than 100 parents gathered at the school this week to voice their anger at the plans.

PPA: The school says teachers need the time for planning, preparation and assessment (posed by model)

Mother-of-one Alaine Lumber, 38, said: ‘This is not just parents having a moan about nothing. This is a vitally important issue.

‘We asked if the teachers would be 
giving up 16 days of the summer holidays to make up for the 16 days of 
teaching the children will be losing. We did not get an answer.’

Schools have a legal requirement to 
ensure that all teachers are given planning, preparation and assessment 
time during the day to help with their workload.

But rather than spread this time out 
across the week, the head at Cottesbrooke decided that grouping the time
together for one afternoon a week ‘will ensure that the children get 
the best out of their education’.Parents, however, say the proposals are
simply a way for teachers to start their weekends early.

They added that many parents  who 
also have children at a nearby affiliated infants’ school would be faced
with the inconvenience of  two separate school runs every Friday 
afternoon.

On Wednesday evening, more than 100 
parents assembled at the school for a meeting about the plans, with 
those in attendance claiming 95 per cent of parents were against them.

One father, a 40-year-old banking 
consultant from Yardley, Birmingham, said: ‘You could describe the 
atmosphere as spicy. There were some very angry people in there.’

Nicola McLarney, 36, who has one daughter at the school, added: ‘My daughter will start to lose part of her education.

‘They said they will provide help for
parents who work, but only if both parents work. Because I work 
part-time, I’ll be excluded.’

Another mother who was at the meeting
said: ‘It’s interesting the school chose a Friday afternoon to close. 
Why not a mid-week day?

‘A lot of the staff are young and a 
lot of parents think it’s an excuse to let the staff have an extended 
weekend.’ Parents also gathered at the school gates yesterday morning to
complain.

Michelle Whitehouse, 38, whose son 
Kane, eight, goes to the school, said: ‘It seems like a stupid idea to 
me. How can they take away half a day’s education like this?

‘I couldn’t go to the meeting because
of when they scheduled it. They have already said they are getting 
teachers in early, at 8.30am to  do this paperwork, so what has changed?
If they need more time to do it they need to come in earlier.’

Mother-of-two Lisa Mountford added: 
‘The simple thing is the teachers cannot be bothered to teach them and 
do their paperwork. They are just destroying our children’s education.’

'Number one priority': The school claims the move would improve the education of their pupils

The half-day closing measure comes 
just months after teachers were criticised in an Ofsted report for 
failing the most able pupils at the school.

A spokesman for the school said no decision had been finalised regarding closing early on Fridays.

In a letter to parents, head teacher 
Pearl Jones said: ‘We can assure you that the children’s education is  
the number one priority and we believe that this method will ensure that
the children get the best out of their education.’

A spokesman for Birmingham City 
Council said: ‘This is ultimately a school decision, with the board of 
governors making a final decision.

‘Wednesday’s meeting with parents was part of a broader consultation on the possibility of altering the school day.

‘There is a legal requirement for 
teachers to be given time to plan lessons. Any proposal would still 
ensure that pupils are taught for the legally required amount of time 
per week.’
