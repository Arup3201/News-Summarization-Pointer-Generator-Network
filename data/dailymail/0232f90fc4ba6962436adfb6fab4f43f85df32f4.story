Pop star Leona Lewis has attacked women in the music industry for acts that 'verge on porn' and said female artists should 'have some self-respect'.

The former X Factor winner attacked her compatriots for allowing themselves to be 'sexually objectified'.

She said it was 'fine to embrace your femininity and your sexiness but with some girl performers it verges on porn and that's when I think, "What are you doing? That's gross. Have some self-respect."'

Role model: Leona Lewis said that it was 'all about looks' for most female acts in the music industry

And she claimed that the reality show that made her name was one of the few exceptions, adding: 'The X Factor is about voice and personality. But outside that, in this industry, for female artists it's about looks.'

However, 2010's final of the show received more than 2,000 complaints to Ofcom after raunchy performances by Rihanna and Christina Aguilera.

Christina wore a super-short black dress, while her female dancers, who were bent over chairs, wore suspenders, bra tops, fishnet stockings and basques in the raunchy routine.

Rihanna's performance in a bra-top, pants and fishnets was judged by Ofcom as having 'some mildly sexual overtones and included images of her gyrating and rocking her buttocks'.

Ofcom said that over one million young children were watching the live final, and 50,000 saw the repeat at 9.30am the following morning.

The regulator warned afterwards that 'sexualised clothing and dance routines' should not feature on programmes watched by children, and Simon Cowell promised to 'tone it 
down a bit'.

Don't copy that! Leona said she has been concerned to see her six-year-old goddaughter imitating suggestive dance routines, such as Christina Aguilera's on the X Factor final in 2010

An Ofcom statement said: 'We want to make sure that during family 
primetime shows, people are very much in safe territory and sticking to 
the rules.'

Speaking to a Sunday newspaper yesterday, Leona insisted that she would like to be 'a positive force for young girls.'

The hugely successful 27-year-old added: 'I'm not an angel. I mean - I have read and enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey - but when I'm making videos, 100 per cent of what influences me is, "Would I be comfortable with my six-year-old goddaughter watching his?"

'I've seen her doing inappropriate raunchy dances from other videos she's seen and I'm like, "No, don't do that."'

Inappropriate: Rihanna's appearance on the 2010 X Factor final also prompted complaints - and now Leona has said she wants to see less focus on appearance for women in the music industry
