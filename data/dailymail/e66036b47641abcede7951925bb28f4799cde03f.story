A heroic father who rushed to rescue a four-year-old buried under 11 tonnes of sand after a lorry overturned  was horrified to find she was his daughter.

Hu Shuncheng, 32, had been returning home from work when he saw the  overloaded lorry on its side close to his home in the city of Yiwu in eastern China's Zhejiang Province.

After emergency services  hauled the lorry up using a crane and started clearing away the sand, Mr Shuncheng saw to his horror that buried beneath it was his four-year-old daughter Xiaoling.

She is now in critical condition and a hospital spokesman said her survival was uncertain due to severe injuries to her head and chest.

Mr Shuncheng said: 'When I got there the emergency workers said a girl had walked into the road and the lorry had swerved to avoid her.

'Having a daughter of my own I was keen to help as I desperately wanted this poor girl to be ok.

'We had to wait for over an hour for the crane to turn up so they could lift the lorry off her, and then we started clearing the sand.

Police are now investigating the crash and say the lorry was seriously overloaded, carrying 11 tonnes of sand when its limit was 1.5 tonnes

Mr Shuncheng said: 'When it turned out that this was my little Xiaoling who was buried I was absolutely devastated and couldn't believe what I was seeing'

'When it turned out that this was my little Xiaoling who was buried I was absolutely devastated and couldn't believe what I was seeing.

'The last thing I expected was to be rescuing my own daughter.'

The girl was taken to hospital with severe injuries to her chest and her head.

A spokesman at the hospital said: 'She is in critical condition and her survival is uncertain.

'We cannot say how Xiaoling's body will respond to the trauma of being crushed and to the operation we carried out.

'We have done all we can from a medical point of view.'

Police are now investigating the crash and say the lorry was seriously overloaded, carrying 11 tonnes of sand when its limit was 1.5 tonnes.
