Sophie the Countess of Wessex made an emotional return to Frimley Park Hospital, where her two children were born, to officially open its new neonatal unit today.

The 49-year-old Royal, whose children, Louise, 10, and James, seven, were both born there, paid an hour-long visit to the hospital, where she shared an emotional embrace with Head of Midwifery, Adrienne Price, who was present at both births.

The new unit is a direct result of the hospital's fundraising efforts. They managed to raise Â£150,000 in the Saving Tiny Lives campaign, which was reinvested into its special care baby unit, which welcomes fifteen new babies a day.

The Countess was reduced to tears as she made a short speech thanking staff for helping her after she was rushed to the hospital for the birth of her first child Lady Louise Windsor; her second child James, Viscount Severn was also born at the hospital

The new neonatal unit will now allow the hospital to treat babies born as early as 27 weeks.

Sophie struggled to fight back her tears as she unveiled the plaque and said: 'Thank you very much for inviting me here today.

'I want to say well done to everyone for your fundraising, and for all the work you do to help thousands of families - your service is the difference between life and death.

'I know all the staff are really keen to get everything started. It is a great working environment and the results you are having are testament to this investment.

'It has been something really important in my life and so I thank you again for inviting me here today.'

Her speech was met with loud applause.

In 2002, the Countess lost her first child when she suffered an
ectopic pregnancy.

Louise was the result of painful fertility procedures and in her
36th week of pregnancy Sophie was admitted to Frimley Park
complaining of severe internal pains.

Doctors found her dangerously ill from blood loss and performed
an emergency delivery.

Lady Louise weighed only 4lb 9oz, and spent two weeks in
intensive care in a specialist neonatal unit at St George's
Hospital, South-West London.

There was an investigation into why it took an ambulance more
than 30 minutes to respond to the Countess's telephone call for
help.

Sophie, who almost died as a result of her blood loss, was too
ill to be moved to be with her baby for six days.

The hospital welcomes 5,300 babies every year, according to Head of midwifery, Adrienne Price, a figure that will reach 6,000 by 2017, they believe

The Queen, who is extremely fond of her daughter-in-law, was so
concerned that she made an unprecedented break with protocol and
secretly visited Sophie in hospital to cheer her up.

Today, Sophie met Louise and Andy Hanson from Camberley, whose two-week-old brothers James and Nathan were both born just over 4lbs. The proud parents will soon be taking the boys home.

The hospital welcomes 5,300 babies every year, according to Head of midwifery, Adrienne Price, a figure that will reach 6,000 by 2017, they believe.

Around one in 10 of these babies - who are premature or sick - require some time in the neonatal care unit.
