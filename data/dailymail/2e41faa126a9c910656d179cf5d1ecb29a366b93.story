Jailed Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel could be just days away from being set free while prosecutors appeal a ruling granting him a new trial in the 1975 slaying of neighbor Martha Moxley.

Skakel, the 53-year-old nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, has spent more than 11 years in prison.

A bond hearing is scheduled for Thursday in Stamford Superior Court for Skakel, who has been serving 20 years to life and was denied parole last year.

Robert Kennedy Jr., who campaigned to 
overturn Skakel's conviction, said he felt ‘pure joy’ at the prospect 
that his cousin was being released. Skakel has only seen his son a 
handful of times since he was sent to prison, he said.

‘Everybody in my family knows that 
Michael is innocent,’ Kennedy told The Associated Press. ‘He was in jail
for over a decade for a crime he didn't commit. The only crime that he 
committed was having a bad lawyer.’

Brutal: Skakel was convicted of murdering his Greenwich, Connecticut neighbor Martha Moxely (pictured) in 1975 by bludgeoning her with his mother's golf club and shoving the shattered shaft into her neck

Judge
Thomas Bishop ruled October 23 that Skakel's trial attorney, Michael 
Sherman, failed to adequately represent him in 2002 when he was 
convicted in Moxley's golf club bludgeoning.

Skakel and Moxley were 15-year-old neighbors in wealthy Greenwich at the time of her death.

Robert
Kennedy Jr said Skakel is in a tough prison and has relied on a deep 
religious faith to cope with his plight. He said he's not sure where 
Skakel will live, noting he had to sell his house in the Catskills to 
pay legal bills.

‘I know there is a lot of people who would open their house for him to stay,’ Kennedy said.

Thursday's hearing is expected to focus on the terms and conditions of his release from prison.

The ruling caught Moxley's family by 
surprise after a decade of unsuccessful appeals by Skakel's attorneys. 
Moxley's 81-year-old mother, Dorthy, is resigned to Skakel being 
released.

‘If he gets out on bail, he gets out on bail,’ Mrs. Moxley said, noting Skakel has a good prison record.

‘I
just think he ought to serve his punishment. There's no doubt in my 
mind that he did it. A little justice for Martha is not asking a lot.’

John Moxley, the victim's brother, said he and his mother will attend the hearing, and he expects Skakel to be released.

Skakel's
attorney, Hubert Santos, has argued that Skakel should be released 
immediately, saying the ruling makes him an innocent defendant awaiting 
trial and that he is not a flight risk.

Santos also argued prosecutors are highly unlikely to win their appeal, a contention prosecutors dispute.

'He's entitled to get out as soon as 
possible,' Santos said, expressing concern that an appeal of the stay 
decision could take a month or two.

Skakel has maintained his innocence.

Skakel's
older brother Thomas was an early suspect in the case because he was 
the last person seen with the victim, but Michael Skakel was charged a 
quarter century after the killing.

Sherman, the trial attorney, has said he did all he could to prevent Skakel's conviction.

Weapon: This photo evidence used at trial shows the murder weapon, a 6 iron golf club that belonged to the late mother of Tommy and Michael Skakel

Martha Moxley was out causing 
mischief on Devil's Night, the night before Halloween, in 1976. She was 
ringing doorbells, spraying shaving cream, throwing eggs, and toilet 
papering homes in her elite gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut.

The last house she happened upon was that of Michael and his brother Tommy Skakel.

She left no later than 11pm, to walk the 150 yards or so to her neighboring house. But she never got there.

Instead, her body was found beneath a tree in her back yard.

She had been bludgeoned with a 6 iron golf club so powerfully that the shaft had shattered.

Martha had been impaled in the neck with a shard from the shattered club.

Her pants had been removed, along with her underwear, but there were no signs of sexual assault.

Tommy
and Michael were initially suspects in the case after it was discovered
that the murder weapon had belonged to their late mother.

Long
believed to have been bungled from the start, many believed police gave
the rich family special treatment in the case and ignored, or failed to
even look for, incriminating evidence.

The case was considered a tough one for prosecutors because of the age of the crime, no forensic evidence and other challenges. But Skakel was convicted after a trial that focused on testimony that he confessed or made incriminating statements over the years.

A year after Skakel was found guilty, a former classmate implicated two friends in the killing. A judge later rejected an appeal, ruling the claim was not credible.

In the latest ruling, Bishop said Skakel's defense should have focused more on Thomas. He also said

Sherman failed to locate a witness who backed up Skakel's alibi that he was at his cousin's house the night of the murder and failed to find a man who challenged the claim by the star witness that Skakel confessed.

The Skakels cooperated with the investigation until 1976, then abruptly stopped.

Years of continued speculation about Tommy, Michael, and a range of other suspects followed.

Books
were published on the subject, including one by Mark Fuhrman of OJ 
Simpson trial infamy, but it wasn't until 1999 that the case got any 
more traction.

Clues? Evidence photo from the trial show a 
hallway in the Skakel home, left, and a drop of blood in their driveway,
right. In the years since the 1975 slaying, some have criticized the 
police investigators of failing to search adequately for clues because 
of the family's prestige

That's when a rare Connecticut one-man grand jury was called to hear evidence for a potential new trial in the case.

Fifty witnesses testified. Reportedly among them were employees and residents
of the Elan School in Poland Springs, Maine, where some claim Michael 
confessed to the murder while undergoing rehab there.

In January 2000, an arrest warrant was issued for Michael Skakel. He soon surrendered to authorities.

After a four week trial, Skakel was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 20 years to life.
