This is the moment a German tennis player lobs her racquet at a linesman after flying into a rage over a bad call.

Andrea Petkovic threw a  temper tantrum after the ball was ruled in by the line judge when it appeared to land outside the baseline.

She crashed to her knees in frustration, banging her hands while screaming and pleading to the umpire, who remained unmoved by her protest.

Still fuming, Petkovic went on to lose the set on the next point, prompting her to throw her racquet in anger towards the bench, narrowly missing the linesman. 

She then sheepishly fishes the racquet out from behind the advertising boards just feet away from the official as she makes her way back to her seat.

Her opponent took advantage of her  mental snap and loss of concentration by going on to win the macth.

The incident took place during the 7-5, 6-3 loss to Zarina Diyas at the Dubai Tennis Championships.

Petkovic isn't the first player to throw explode on the court - and she certainly won't be the last.

Last month, MailOnline revisited the best temper tantrums in the Australian Open, not to mention the most famous ever: John McEnroe’s ‘You can not be serious’ tirade at Wimbledon in 1981.

At the Australian Open, Serena Williams once threatened the line judge in 2009, while Xavier Malisse had a hissy fit in 2005, lying on the ground and refusing to get up to resume the match.  

Several competitors this year have revealed a less-than-flattering side of their personalities whilst Down Under, succumbing to meltdowns on the hot Melbourne courts.

Nineteenth seed John Isner took his rage to centre stage following his shock straight-set loss to unseeded Gilles Muller.

An irate Isner threw his tennis racquet across the court twice, running after it to give it another serve to ensure his equipment was sufficiently destroyed.

With all the force he could muster the US tennis star slammed the tennis racquet across the floor, where it bounced several times before laying crumpled and useless.
