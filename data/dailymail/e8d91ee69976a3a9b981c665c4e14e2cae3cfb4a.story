The packing checklist for a girls’ break abroad can – most women would surely admit – be a lengthy one, with the shoes section alone capable of taking up several pages.

But if there is one thing a female traveller does not need to take with her on holiday, then – according to new research – it’s a man.

Holiday heaven for one: Two thirds of British women feel more confident taking a holiday by themselves

A poll of over 2000 British holidaymakers has revealed a growing trend for women to take trips abroad by themselves – with many saying they enjoy the experience far more than when they are accompanied by a husband, a boyfriend or a male companion.

The survey, which was conducted by accommodation website Booking.com, revealed that 54 per cent of British women say they are more likely to take a foreign escape by themselves than they were five years ago – while almost two thirds (64 per cent) say that they feel more confident when taking a trip on their own than with a man.

Travelling alone also seems to be beneficial to the holiday itself, with 61 per cent of women surveyed saying they feel more energised when taking a holiday by themselves – and more refreshed for the experience when they return home.

Reasons given for these boys-not-invited breaks include a greater sense of freedom, and the chance to travel without having to cater to other people.

Just short of two thirds of the women who responded to the survey said a break for one means they have the opportunity to be themselves while away.

Staying in touch: 62 per cent of female travellers keep in contact by using social media while on their travels

And almost half – 47 per cent – said that a solo holiday is heaven because they can be selfish and do exactly what they like – without having to worry about a partner who wants to see different sights or do something else during a long day in the sun.

‘Our research suggests that the phenomenon of the female solo traveller is one that is here to stay,’ says Paul Hennessy of Booking.com.

‘A third of British female travellers are looking for that freedom to set their own agenda, and to find that boost in confidence that a solo break provides.’

The survey also showed that social media is the key way of communicating for the modern female traveller.

Again, almost two thirds of respondees – 62 per cent – said that they keep in touch with friends and relatives at home by using the likes of Facebook and Twitter.

And three quarters – 75 per cent – said that social media gives them the confidence to travel alone, enabling them to plan a route in advance, or unearth places to eat and stay.

Which way from here? 64 per cent of women surveyed said a holiday by themselves gives them more freedom

The poll was conducted from a sample of British men and women, aged between 25 and 45, who have travelled away from the UK since April 2013.

And half of the women surveyed enjoyed their holiday me-time so much that they tend to do it all over again – 51 per cent say they plan to travel solo again in the next 12 months.
