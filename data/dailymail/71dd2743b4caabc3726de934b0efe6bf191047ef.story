Two major insurance companies have been fined £2.17million for tampering with customer complaints files before passing them to the City watchdog.

Churchill and Direct Line, owned by state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland, were found guilty by the Financial Services Authority of amending old complaints files and forging signatures to ensure they passed muster.

Direct line - perhaps not a good deal better after all!

The case will infuriate taxpayers, who will have to foot the bill, and heaps embarrassment on RBS, which was fined £2.8million a year ago for ‘multiple failings’ in complaints handling.

The fine relates to 50 closed customer complaints files sent in April 2010 to the FSA during its investigation into how well the firms were handling complaints about general insurance.

Of these, 27 had been altered before they were sent to the FSA, and seven internal documents were found to contain signatures that had been forged by a member of staff.

Some 28 documents in the 27 bad files had either been altered or created by the firms’ staff.

Tracey McDermott, the FSA’s acting director of enforcement and financial crime, said: ‘This is a serious breach. The firms’ attempts to ensure complete files were provided to the FSA backfired.’

Insurance firm Churchill has been fined for fudging complaint files, including signature forgery, the City watchdog said today

In
February 2010, the FSA informed Direct Line and Churchill that it would
undertake a review of files to assess the effectiveness of the companies'
complaint-handling process.

In
preparation for this review, the firms asked a major accountancy firm to do a
sample or practice review and discovered that 28 per cent of the 110 files submitted
failed to meet complaint-handling requirements.

Before the
two companies sent the 50 files off for the official review with the FSA, they
conducted a conference call with staff, in which they warned that any similar
failure could lead to enforcement action for the firm.

Staff were
also told that, if they were found not to be operating to the required
standard, they could face disciplinary investigation.

Following
the warnings to staff, the firms sent off the files, which were later
discovered to contain the altered paperwork.

Paul
Geddes, chief executive of RBS Insurance, said: 'We very much regret the
findings of the FSA investigation.

'Although
no customers were disadvantaged, we are very disappointed that we did not meet
the standards we expect of ourselves and which the FSA expects of us.'

The two
firms agreed to settle the case at an early stage and qualified for a 30 per cent
discount - without the reduction, the FSA would have fined them £3.1million.

Argos forced by FSA to shut down price comparison website

Argos was forced to shut its price comparison site yesterday - just four months after it relaunched.

The
tool, which was powered by Beatthatquote.com, compared credit cards and
insurance deals but fell foul of new guidance issued by the Financial 
Services Authority.

A statement on the site simply reads: ‘We're sorry, Argos compare is no longer available'.

Gone: Argos has taken down its comparison service because it didn't sit comfortably with new guidance from the FSA, a spokesman said

An Argos spokesman said the site is 
‘under review'. A relaunch will remain firmly in the pipeline until the
company has rewired its operation.

ArgosCompare.co.uk
sprang up again in October to much fanfare. It boasted two best buy 
credit cards from Barclaycard and offered a £20 Argos gift card as a 
sweetener to anyone spending £100 or more on the cards in the first 60 
days.

Those with gift cards will see them honoured, Argos said.

The
site struggled against monolithic competitors like 
Moneysupermarket.com, Comparethemarket.com, and GoCompare.com.

It had an
estimated 71,000 unique visitors a month, according to Google 
analytics, compared to some seven million at Moneysupermarket.com.

ArgosCompare's tough battle for market share, though, was not behind a decision to take a short sabbatical from the web.

In a statement, Argos said: ‘Following
revised guidance by the Financial Services Authority regarding the 
regulation of UK price comparison websites, Argos has placed 
ArgosCompare.co.uk under review and the site is currently unavailable to
new business. We are working to resolve the situation as soon as 
possible.

'Customers are
still able to claim their Argos gift cards from previous transactions 
via the website and other Argos financial services, including insurance,
are unaffected and are available at www.argos.co.uk.'

The FSA published new guidelines for insurance comparison sites in October, citing concern over ‘the possibility that consumers could 
be misled about the services and information they receive'.

This could happen if it is unclear whether an insurance quote is tailored to an individual or is just an ‘illustrative' figure.

The
FSA said: ‘We expect firms to take reasonable steps to ensure consumers
buy insurance policies that they will be eligible to claim on.'

The
guidelines also raised the issue of price comparison services 
'white-labelled' to a third party.

An FSA spokesman explained that 
sometimes it is unclear exactly who is responsible for pointing a 
customer towards a certain insurance product. By extension, it is 
therefore unclear to whom a customer should complain if things go wrong.

The
FSA said third parties offering insurance comparison must shoulder 
responsibility for the service. If they rated or recommended a deal - 
perhaps by naming it a 'featured product' or giving it five stars - this
might constitute advice.

Beatthatquote,
which powered Argos' services, is a specialist in letting third parties
use its comparison tool to power their own-branded services.

The 
business was bought Google for £38million in March last year. Its last 
submitted accounts before that showed the business making a £2million 
loss on revenues of £8million.
