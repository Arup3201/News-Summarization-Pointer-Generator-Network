This is the amazing moment one enthusiastic snowkiter jumped so high he risked his life to feel like he was flying in Park City, Utah 

Andrew Muse, a 26-year-old extreme sports enthusiast from Utah, recorded a video with his heart-dropping stunts, jumps, dips and spins

Muse said this last snowkiting trip was 'the most dangerous thing I've ever done'. 'At some points, I was over 300 feet off the ground'

Muse said this last snowkiting trip was 'the most dangerous thing I've ever done'.  

'At some points, I was over 300 feet off the ground and kites are only just capable of flying like that. 

'Kites aren't really designed for that kind of height so if one part of the system failed I could have died.

Muse first got into snowkiting in 2011 when, rather than driving or catching the bus, he decided to hitchhike his way to the canyons in his native Utah.

He said: 'I was just looking for an adventure when this kid from Maui picked me up as he was headed to the same mountain.

'We ended up riding together for the day. Later in the afternoon he asked if I wanted to go try kiteboarding. 

'At some points, I was over 300 feet off the ground and kites are only just capable of flying like that,' said Muse. 'Kites aren't really designed for that kind of height so if one part of the system failed I could have died'

Muse first got into snowkiting in 2011 when, while hitchhiking his way to the canyons in his native Utah, he met a fellow boarder from Maui. 'We ended up riding together for the day,' Muse said. 'Later in the afternoon he asked if I wanted to go try kiteboarding'

Muse said from that day on he knew kiteboarding was 'something I was going to pursue with a passion' 

'At that point I had only seen kiteboarding on the internet but it looked like something I would absolutely love!

'From that day on I knew it was something I was going to pursue with passion.'  

And Muse has continued to do just that

He said: 'I'm relentlessly positive.

'This was an amazing trip and the video tells the story really well. It was like I was flying. 

The snowkiter said his video 'tells the story really well' and said there were times in the air he felt like he was flying 

Muse has always loved the mountains and said his passion has not only fueled a thrilling drive for extreme sports, it's also repaired family ties

'The ability to go up hills or mountains and snowboard down or just legitimately fly off them is the most amazing feeling.

'I have had an incredible amount of adventures and small world experiences. I am 26 and doing my best to live the happiest more adventurous life possible.'

Muse has always loved the mountains. But he said his passion has not only fueled a thrilling drive for extreme sports, it's also repaired family ties.

'I knew I loved the mountains so I took a Ski Patrol course. 

Muse introduced his mom, a former drug addict and alcoholic, to rock climbing one summer. He said the experience showed her 'she could experience happiness without being high'. She has since been sober for three years 

After seeing his family life turn around, Muse is now focusing on pursuing his snowkiting career and hopes to compete professionally

'That summer I took my Mom, a former drug addict and alcoholic, rock climbing.

'This showed her she could experience happiness without being high. She got sober and I went to New Hampshire to ski patrol. She has been completely sober for three years.'

After seeing his family life turn around, Muse is now focusing on pursuing his snowkiting career and hopes to compete professionally.

'It's what I love. I'd really like to compete and take my snowkiting career to the next level. It's just a matter of getting to a competition and having the funding to do so.'

'It's what I love,' he said. 'I'd really like to compete and take my snowkiting career to the next level. It's just a matter of getting to a competition and having the funding to do so'
