Research undertaken at the University of Oslo  shows that dope cheats such as Justin Gatlin could still be benefiting from taking banned substances years after initial usage.

The experiments carried out by by scientists in Norway show for the first time that muscles could retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids for decades after they were first used.

The 2004 Olympic 100 metres champion Gatlin was banned for a maximum of eight years by the United States Anti-Doping Agency after testing positive for testosterone at the Kansas Relays in Lawrence in 2006 - his second failed drugs test.

Professor of physiology at the University of Oslo Kristen Gunderson and his team studied the effect of steroids on mice and believes that the same mechanism is at work in human muscles and that other performance-enhancing drugs would have similar long-term effects.

Gunderson told BBC Sport: 'I would be very surprised if there were any major differences between humans and mice in this context.

'The fundamental biology of muscle growth is similar in humans and in mice, and in principle any drug that builds muscle mass could trigger this mechanism.

'I think it is likely that effects could be lifelong or at least lasting decades in humans. Our data indicates the exclusion time of two years is far too short. Even four years is too short.'

Thirty-two-year-old American Gatlin served a four-year ban after appeal to arbitration and - after his return to the sport in 2010 - he ran the fastest 100 metres in the world in this year as he clocked 9.77 seconds to claim a dominant victory at the Memorial van Damme in Brussels last month.

But British 400 metres hurdles champion Dai Greene said: 'He's over the hill as far as sprinting is concerned - he should never be running these times for the 100m and 200m.

'But he's still doing it, and you have to look at his past, and ask how it is still affecting him now, because the average person wouldn't be able to do that.

'Those are incredible performances. Not many people have run that fast separately, ever. To do it on a damp Friday night? I couldn't believe those times.

'It shows one of two things: either he's still taking performance-enhancing drugs to get the best out of him at his advanced age, or the ones he did take are still doing a fantastic job.

'Because there is no way he can still be running that well at this late point in his career.

'After having years on the sidelines, being unable to train or compete, it doesn't really add up. 9.77 is an incredibly fast time. You only have to look at his performances. I don't believe in them.'

The new data casts a further shadow over formerly-banned athletes such as Gatlin, his compatriot Tyson Gay and Britain's Dwain Chambers.

In his defence, Gatlin's agent Renaldo Nehemiah said: 'Justin would have run these times, and faster, had his over-zealous (former) coach Trevor Graham not tried to get him there sooner than he would've naturally gotten there.

'So, what Justin is doing right now, I'm not surprised by that.

'His body is rested for four years, so he wasn't racing. And he was the talent that I always knew he was.'
