Jeffrey Fowle, one of three Americans being held in North Korea, has been released, the State Department said Tuesday

Detained American tourist Jeffrey Fowle had been released from North Korea and was on his way home to be with his family.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the United States welcomed the move but pressed North Korea to release two other U.S. citizens as well.

'While this is a positive decision ... we remain focused on the continued detention of Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller and again call on the DPRK to immediately release them,' Earnest said, referring to North Korea. 

The United States will continue to work actively on those cases, he said.

North Korea made it a condition of Fowle's release that the U.S. government transport him out of the country. 

The Department of Defense provided that transportation within the time frame that was set, officials said.

Fowle, 56, a street repair worker from Miamisburg, Ohio, was arrested in May for leaving a Bible at a club for foreign sailors in the North Korean city of Chongjin. 

The United States expressed thanks to the government of Sweden, which has an embassy in Pyongyang, for its efforts on Fowle's case. Sweden acts as a 'protecting power' for the United States there. 

Washington has tried for months to send a high-level envoy to North Korea to seek release of the three men.

Analysts say North Korea has previously used detained Americans as leverage in its standoff with the U.S. over its nuclear and missile programs, a charge that Pyongyang denies.

Kenneth Bae, was sentenced by North Korea last year to 15 years hard labour for crimes against the state.

U.S. special representative for North Korean policy Glyn Davies said Pyongyang's refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it 'doesn't have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country'.

'One of the greatest impediments to getting back to any sort of a more productive place with North Korea is the fact that for so long they have held Kenneth Bae and have since picked up these other two Americans and as we say are really using them,' Davies said. 

American citizen Matthew Miller is escorted by a North Korean soldier to a telephone booth at a hotel in the capital Pyongyang, where he was allowed to make a call to his family. He was sentenced to six years of hard labour earlier this month after being convicted of entering the country illegally to commit espionage

North Korea has twice cancelled visits by Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, to discuss Bae's case.

'There have been other efforts behind the scenes to seek to have these conversations with the North Koreans. They simply won't engage us. It's very frustrating,' Davies told reporters in Beijing, where he met Chinese officials before travelling to Seoul and Tokyo.

'It's unhelpful and I think it puts the lie to the contention of the regime that they want a better relationship with us,' he said. 

Last month another American man Matthew Miller said he is digging in fields eight hours a day and being kept in isolation, but that so far his health isn't deteriorating.

Under close guard and with only enough time to respond to one question, Matthew Miller spoke briefly to an Associated Press Television News journalist at a Pyongyang hotel, where he had been brought to make a phone call to his family.

It was the 24-year-old's first appearance since he was convicted on September 14 of entering the country illegally to commit espionage. 

'Prison life is eight hours of work per day. Mostly it's been agriculture, like in the dirt, digging around,' Miller said when asked what conditions were like in prison.

'Other than that, it's isolation, no contact with anyone.

'But I have been in good health, and no sickness or no hurts,' he said, showing little emotion.
