A woman has been killed after her new assault rifle which she was showing to her friends fired - shooting her in the head. 

Gun enthusiast Anastasia Adair, 22, was walking down the stairs and into the garage in her home in Federal Heights, Colorado, when she reached out to hand the rifle to her husband. 

The gun, believed to look like an AK-47, fired, hitting her in the head on Tuesday at about 10.40pm local time.

Husband Shane Adair, a tattoo artist, told police he is not sure if he touched the gun as his wife handed it to him, according to Federal Heights Police Lt. Gary Toldness. 

The gun is believed to have fired another shot as the Mrs Adair fell down the stairs and into her husband's arms.

She was taken to Denver Health Medical Centre where she pronounced dead. 

An investigation has been launched to determine what exactly happened but ballistics tests and an analysis of the bullet trajectory could take months.

The rifle is believed to have looked like an AK-47 which is similar to the one pictured

Lt Toldness told abc7news that the couple had been firing the gun, which she bought at the Tanner Gun Show in March, the day before the shooting.

According to investigators, Mr Adair has said the rifle had a light trigger pull.
