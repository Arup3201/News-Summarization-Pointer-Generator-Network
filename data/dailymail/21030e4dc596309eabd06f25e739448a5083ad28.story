Ever thought, 'I'd love to throw a big bash but I'm terrified all my belongings will get totally trashed?'

Or, maybe you're scarred from a teenage house party that went terribly wrong when your granny's antique vase was smashed to smithereens.

A storage company is cashing in on those fears and offering to look after all your worldly goods while you and your mates drink and dance the night away.

Lovespace has launched a party protection service and will turn up at your door and take away your prized possession for 24 hours, ahead of your big bash.

The service means that as the host you can relax safe in the knowledge nobody will topple into your vintage table or even decide to nick your pricey laptop.

Party hosts can relax, safe in the knowledge that nothing of value will have wine spilled on it, nor be broken

'With the party protection service, you can be the perfect party host and be free to party the night away, safe in the knowledge nothing will have wine spilled on it and nothing can get damaged,' says a spokesperson.

'We'll collect your things straight from your door and store them overnight.

'After guests have gone home and 
your house is cleaned and back to normal, you can then book in the 
delivery of your things - we'll pack up your boxes and bring them 
straight back to your door.'

The aftermath: You might have some cleaning up to do but a new service can make sure all your valuables stay safe while you party

Hosts from all over mainland UK can book the service directly through the company website lovespace.co.uk from just £5.95.

A representative will deliver boxes, bubble wrap and 
tape directly to your door for you to pack your things up a day or two before the big night.

They then 
return with their van and whisk your goods away to their Lovespace warehouse in London to store 
while you party.

'Everyone 
always seems to plan house parties around when they're moving in or out 
of a house so they don't run the risk of ruining any of their things,' continues the spokesperson.

'So we thought we could offer a service that effectively gives you that 
freedom.'

And if you're planning a last-minute get-together, they work on short notice too. Packing materials can be delivered the next day, including Saturday. Collection and delivery of your goods can be booked for next day, Monday to Friday.

'Everyone loves a good house party, but as you get a little older and wiser, the thought of your worldly possessions getting damaged can put you off hosting the perfect party.'

The service can't help you with your hangover though, or the cleaning up...
