Severe weather is leaving large swaths of the country battered and bruised today.

The East Coast was walloped with torrential rains and heavy thunderstorms Tuesday night, strong winds buffeted parts of the western United States, while the parched West Coast continues to struggle with extreme drought. 

The bout of extreme weather saw cars float out of their parking spots in flooded Connecticut, 4,000 lightning strikes in a single hour in one New Jersey town, flash floods in Utah and a monsoon so strong in Arizona that heavy winds flipped over and F-16 fighter jet.

But, it also brought an incredible photo op for the Empire State Building - captured by William Anderson lightning striking the skyscraper's spire. Astonishingly, Mr Anderson took the picture iPhone 5. He posted it on his Instragram account, @thewilliamanderson.

In California, meanwhile, 80percent of the state is in 'extreme drought.' Wells and reservoirs are running dry and towns across the state - especially in parched southern California - are in danger of running out of water entirely.

In Rexburg, Idaho, a heavy thunderstorm caused intense flooding with up to waist-deep water - one of several bouts of severe weather to strike the U.S. on Tuesday

In York, Maine, a high winds knocked over a massive oak tree, which came smashing down on a parked car

In Tuscon, Arizona, a 20,000-pound fighter jet was picked up by the wind and tossed on top of another plane at Davis-Monthan Air Force Bace

The severe weather dumped anywhere from three to ten inches of rain along the East Coast from Maryland to Maine.

The New York suburbs in Connecticut and New Jerseys, as well as Westchester and Long Island were hit especially hard.

Strong winds knocked over trees and power lines.

In Belmar, New Jersey, 4,000 lightning strikes were recorded from 8pm to 9pm, WCBS-TV reports.

Flash flood warnings were in effect for most of the night in New York and the surrounding area.

Motorists found themselves stranded in deep water and had to be rescued from their cars by firefighters.

Crisis: On the West Coast, meanwhile, 80percent of the state is in extreme drought. Reservoirs, wells and rivers are in danger of running dry

The California legislature this week enacted a law that allows cities to fine people $500 for water their lawns and washing their cars

In Pennsylvania, a 12-year-old girl was sucked through a flooded storm drain pipe from severe weather on Monday. She emerged a half mile away, scratched and bruised but OK.

Several weather spotters in the New York area reported hail.

In the Western U.S., a monsoon brought heavy winds and rain that flooded Rexburg, Idaho.

The same storm uprooted trees and cracked power poles in Tuscon, Arizona. At Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, the wind was strong enough to flip over a retired F-16 fighter jet that was sitting in the junkyard.

In California, meanwhile, 80percent of the state remains in extreme drought and more than a third is in 'exceptional' drought - the worst classification.

State lawmakers approved new authority to towns and cities to fine people $500 for washing their cars or water lawns - all in an attempt to conserve water. 

In Lakewood, New Jersey, cars were submerged nearly to the tops of their tires by a flash flood, leaving motorists stranded

Devastated: Residents in Rexburg, Idaho, were flooded out of their home thanks to the rains on Tuesday

New Yorkers ran for cover after the rains began to swamp the city - leaving traffic delayed and many millions of commuters soaked

Many towns, especially in Southern California, are in danger of running out of water entirely. Reservoirs are drying up and some rivers have run dry.

'Not everybody in California understands how bad this drought is ... and how bad it could be,' California Water Resources Control Board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus told the Associated Press.

'There are communities in danger of running out of water all over the state.'

The drought is expected to continue into next year - even if California gets a wet winter. Even El Niño, the powerful Pacific Ocean phenomenon - which promised to bring wet weather to the region - has petered out. 

The lack of water is historic. Downtown Los Angeles has recorded its longest dry spell since record-keeping began in 1877.

Storms continues on Wednesday on the East Coast and out west. Southern California remains hot and dry

The Northeast clears up for Thursday, though storms continue in Texas and Oklahoma
