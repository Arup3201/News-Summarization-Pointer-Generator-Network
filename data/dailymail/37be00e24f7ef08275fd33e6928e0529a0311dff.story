A senior Labour MP has claimed expenses from the taxpayer for attending Remembrance Day services in his constituency.

Adrian Bailey, who earns more than £80,000, claimed £13 to attend three separate services in his West Bromwich constituency in November last year.

Mr Bailey, chairman of the powerful Commons business, innovation and skills committee, also claimed £3.15 to attend the launch of a local poppy appeal in Tipton the previous month.

In the wrong? Adrian Bailey's (pictured in dark shades) claims on expenses for attending a remembrance service at West Bromwich Town Hall is in poor taste

The claims are permitted under Parliament’s supposedly tough new expenses rules and were approved by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa).

But Mr Bailey’s decision to claim mileage expenses for attending events that many consider a civic duty is likely to raise eyebrows.

Figures published yesterday reveal that he claimed £2.70 in mileage for a six-mile round trip to attend the remembrance service at West Bromwich town hall. He then claimed £4.95 for an 11-mile round trip to the service at Wednesbury British Legion. Finally, he claimed a further £5.40 for a 12-mile round trip to a service at Wood Green cemetery.

Mr Bailey is a senior figure on Labour’s backbenches and is paid £14,500 on top of his MPs’ salary in recognition of his role as a select committee chairman.

Excessive? Ed Balls claimed over £155 for a taxi fare into London last year

Despite his generous salary, the new figures suggest he is scrupulous about claiming his expenses, however small.

On two occasions in November he claimed £2.25 for ‘tea and cake’, while on another he charged the taxpayer £3.35 for ‘cake, apple, coffee and two plums’.

Mr Bailey was invited to comment last night but did not respond.

The figures were included in the latest batch of expenses data from Ipsa.

In the two months of October and November last year Ipsa processed £3.5 million in expenses claims from MPs.

Notable claims include a £155.65 taxi fare submitted by the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls when he returned to London for the recall of Parliament following the riots in August last year.

Aides last night Mr Balls was forced to get a taxi from Gatwick Airport to his north London home after catching a late flight home from a foreign holiday.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening submitted two 10p claims for bus fares, although an aide stressed that the claims related to travel expenses for an intern working in her office.

The aide pointed that Miss Greening did not claim for her own travel around her constituency in Putney, London.

In total, MPs claimed for more than £92,000 in mileage during the two-month period. Critics argue that the ability of MPs to claim 40p a mile in mileage cushions them from the pain caused to ordinary motorists by soaring fuel prices.

MPs also claimed £11,352, for taxis, despite a supposed ban in all but exceptional circumstances.
