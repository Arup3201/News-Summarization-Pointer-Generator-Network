Death: Daniel Cripps, 22, had downed 14 shots of vodka in a drinking game in Newport, South Wales

Two paramedics were today suspended for not to take a dying man to hospital after failing to fully assess his condition at a drunken house party.

Welsh Ambulance Service employees Ian Powell and Lindsey Brown were called to the alcohol-fuelled party in Newport, South Wales, by the concerned friends of 22-year-old Daniel Cripps.

The aspiring male model had downed 14 shots of vodka in a drinking game with his companions.

A disciplinary hearing was told Mr Powell and Miss Brown failed to fully assess his condition. Mr Cripps, who had drunk ‘a large amount of alcohol’, suffered a heart attack 24 minutes later.

Another ambulance came to take him to hospital but he failed to regain consciousness and died.

Chairwoman Linda Summers said at the Health and Care Professions Council hearing that Mr Powell and Miss Brown had allowed the party to ‘override’ their clinical judgement.

She said: ‘Neither paramedic has been able to offer a satisfactory explanation why the house and the people provided a safer environment for Patient A (Mr Cripps) than the hospital.

‘What underpins this case was the failure to assess all the relevant information at the scene and allowing irrelevant factors to over-ride clinical judgement.’

Mr Powell and Miss Brown were suspended from the register for 12 months for failing to take Mr Cripps to hospital. The party was just a five-minute drive away from Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital.

An inquest in January 2012 heard Daniel complained of feeling unwell after taking part in a drinking game and was ‘completely out of it’.

Party hostess Danielle Baker, 24, told the hearing: ‘The paramedics told him he needed to sleep.

‘After they left, he was sick and his lips turned blue. We called a second ambulance which arrived nearly half an hour after the first one left.’

Mr Powell told the hearing: ‘In the back of my mind was the thought to take him to hospital. But we left him. His friends were saying to let him sleep it off and we were swayed by the environment.

'He was in a quiet place with people he knew. If it was a pub, club or raucous party I might have taken a different decision.’

Gwent coroner David Bowen had recorded a narrative verdict on the death of Mr Cripps, of Maesglas, Newport, adding: ‘With hindsight he should have been taken to hospital.’

Mr Cripps’s family are taking legal action against the ambulance service.
