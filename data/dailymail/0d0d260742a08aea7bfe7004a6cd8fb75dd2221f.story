Sportsmail's panel of experts Nasser Hussain, Paul Newman, Lawrence Booth and David Lloyd discuss the lessons to be learnt from this summer 

What more must Alastair Cook do to challenge Michael Clarke as a captain?

Nasser Hussain: Still quite a lot. Cook has to learn both from the 10 Tests England failed to win and the three they did. He has to keep focusing on his batting – he has made technical changes that have worked against India but will they work against Mitchell Johnson?

David Lloyd: Not a lot. Michael Clarke had a fantastic attack in the last Ashes and when you’ve got that everything else becomes pretty easy. If Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad continue to bowl as well as they have done the captain can deal with any situation. A lot of this ‘funky’ captaincy business is for effect.

Taste of success: England celebrate impressive series win against India at The Oval

Lawrence Booth:
 He’ll never match Clarke for funkiness but he can watch how Clarke 
always tries to stay ahead of the game. England’s worst moments this 
summer came when Cook let things drift.

Paul Newman:
 Nothing. He must do things his way. Cook’s strengths are leading by 
example and creating a healthy environment that earns the respect of his
 team. They are all behind him. Once he scored runs at Southampton 
everything else fell into place and he grew as a captain.

How did England turn it around against India?

Newman:
 The senior players in Cook, Bell, Anderson and Broad were all back to 
their best from Southampton onwards which allowed the less experienced 
ones to grow without the pressure of delivering in every match. India 
helped by becoming obsessed with getting Anderson banned and losing 
focus.  

Booth:
 A bit of luck, some resolve, and the realisation that something had to 
change. They were in denial until they got to Southampton. They were 
also helped by India’s ineptitude.

Inspired: England's Gary Ballance has gone from strength to strength since taking the No 3 slot

Lloyd:
 Cook being back in the runs was the key. Once he scored them in the 
third Test he became a better captain and England immediately looked 
like a much better team. He hasn’t totally cracked it yet and he still 
hasn’t got that hundred but he’s getting there.

Hussain: Through
 the senior players, mainly the fabulous bowling of Jimmy Anderson and 
Stuart Broad and the mental strength and steely determination of 
Alastair Cook. They found rock bottom and discovered that the only way 
is up. Cook must take a lot of the credit for the way the series was 
transformed.

Who have been the star performers among the Test new boys?

Booth:
 Gary Ballance has allowed us to quietly forget Jonathan Trott and, 
unlike Trott, he has a fifth gear. Jos Buttler is incredibly exciting. 
It was a huge moment when England accepted that Matt Prior’s time was 
up.

Lloyd: Gary
 Ballance first and foremost and Moeen Ali has gone from strength to 
strength with the ball but they have all done well. The only remaining 
question is what must they do with Sam Robson? I’ve said it before but 
Robson must lighten up. He can’t be staring at the pitch after every 
ball.

Key man: Joe Root played a pivotal role in England's series triumph

VIDEO Root and Anderson thrilled with win 

Newman:
 Peter Moores decision to give Gary Ballance the No 3 slot proved 
inspired and I am delighted that Moeen Ali has shown that he really can 
replace Graeme Swann as England’s spinner. They have all been successes 
with the possible exception of Sam Robson and all have the potential to 
grow more.

Hussain:
 It has to be Gary Ballance. To come in and fill the massive hole left 
by Jonathan Trott while being able to ease the pressure on Alastair Cook
 by increasing the tempo of his batting has been phenomenal. He can play
 in different ways and notably goes up through the gears.

How do we become less reliant on Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad?

Lloyd:
 Get Steven Finn fit and firing. If he can get back to bowling anything 
like he was at his best then that will ease the pressure on Anderson and
 Broad. What England are doing is getting a good battery of fast bowlers
 together in time for 17 Tests in nine months from next April. Finn and 
Stokes should be equally as effective as Jordan and Woakes.

Hussain:
 Provide emerging bowlers with proper chances, like batsmen get. Chris 
Jordan has improved the more he has bowled. The key is to look after 
Anderson and Broad so that they can go on as long as possible. I don’t 
think either of them should play any more limited-overs cricket after 
the World Cup.

Pair of aces: James Anderson and Stuart Broad are a formidable new-ball partnership

Booth:
 England already are. Chris Woakes was unlucky all series and Chris 
Jordan got better after a shaky start. Waiting in the seam bowling wings
 are Steven Finn, Ben Stokes and Liam Plunkett. Things look healthy.

Newman:
 It’s all about this ‘over-supply’ of players that Paul Downton talks 
about. England have to create as big a pool as possible to cope with the
 ridiculous demands that the schedule for 2015 and 2016 represents. 
Anderson and Broad will have to miss one-day cricket to be available for
 all the Tests.

Is Moeen Ali the answer as a spinner?

Newman:
 One hundred per cent yes. Derek Pringle put it perfectly when he said 
‘Moeen may not be a Swann but he’s no ugly duckling either.’ I always 
thought he was better than Alastair Cook and Peter Moores seemed to 
think and he has proved it. He has the potential to be better than 
Nathan Lyon next summer.  

Booth:
 He’s not in Graeme Swann’s class but these comparisons are unhelpful. 
What mattered is that he improved quickly. It’s hard to say if he’s 
frontline yet – India were too poor for us to tell – but he’s way better
 than part time.

Positive spin: Moeen Ali is emerging as a frontline slow bowling option for England

Hussain:
 In the short term, yes. He has been the answer to balancing the side 
and there is no point in replacing him with a ‘specialist’ who can bowl 
just a little bit better, if there is anyone like that out there. 
England still need to find a left-arm spinner to compliment Moeen while 
the structure needs to be looked at so we produce more spinners.

Lloyd:
 Yes I think he is. You don’t take 19 wickets against India by accident!
 He must have something. He has grown in confidence and got more shape 
in his action. Moeen can be for this side what Ashley Giles was for the 
2005 side. A key component of the team with ball and bat.

What are our chances of regaining the Ashes and what do we need to improve?

Hussain:
 England’s chances are good. Home advantage is the key in modern Test 
cricket. Only Zimbabwe lost any Tests at home throughout the whole of 
2013. How we play Mitchell Johnson and Ryan Harris will be the key. 
Australia are an ageing side while England have potential to grow, both 
in and out of the side.

Lloyd:
 England have every chance of regaining the Ashes. The likes of Mitchell
 Johnson, Ryan Harris, Chris Rogers and Brad Haddin are no spring 
chickens. Will they all be here? Will Johnson be as good again as he was
 last time? One thing England can improve is the pitches. They wanted 
slow low ones last year against Australia but I think they will go the 
other way next year.

Follow the leader: Cook’s strengths are leading by example and creating healthy environment

Booth:
 It depends if Mitchell Johnson is fit and firing. If he’s not England 
will win. They need a reliable opening partner for Alastair Cook and Ian
 Bell must rediscover the form that helped beat Australia 3-0 a year 
ago.

Newman:
 I’m confident England will win the Ashes next year as long as Jimmy 
Anderson and Stuart Broad have not been finished off by all the cricket 
before then. We must keep our fingers crossed the operation on Broad’s 
knee goes well while I think England need to find a new opener. Not sure
 about Sam Robson.   

Name two players who could force their way into the side for the Ashes

Booth:
 Nottinghamshire’s opener Alex Hales could be England’s answer to slam 
bang Aussie opener David Warner. And I hope Steven Finn spends five 
Tests against West Indies and New Zealand before then remembering what 
it’s like to take Test wickets.

Lloyd:
 Alex Hales could do it and here’s a bit of a long shot for you, Simon 
Kerrigan. I’ve got everything crossed when I say that but a lot of 
people I respect have told me Kerrigan can bowl. I haven’t seen it 
myself yet but I’m taking their word for it.

One to watch: Alex Hales could force his way into Test team if he impresses in one-day format

Hussain:
 If Alex Hales has a good six months of ODI cricket then he could be a 
candidate but it would be a gamble. Other than opening it’s hard to see 
where England need new players for next year which is a good sign but 
I’d say Steven Finn if he concentrates on sheer pace. But both would 
have to improve to get into next year’s side.

Newman: I
 can see where everybody is coming from when they say Alex Hales and it 
may just work but we might have to accept a few failures from him in 
exchange for the odd occasion when he would spectacularly come off. A 
second player? Keep an eye on Alex Lees of Yorkshire. England rate him 
very highly.
