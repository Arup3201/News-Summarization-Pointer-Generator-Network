Former Real Madrid manager Jorge Valdano believes his compatriot Lionel Messi looks tired and is no longer capable of causing havoc among opposition defences.

Messi endured a difficult evening at the Bernabeu on Saturday as Barcelona lost the first Clasico of the season to bitter rivals Real.

The 27-year-old had a game to forget, missing a clear-cut opportunity to score in the first-half as Carlo Ancelotti's men ran out 3-1 winners.

Appearances: 9

Goals scored: 7

Assists: 7

Chances created: 31

Shooting accuracy: 64 per cent 

Passing accuracy: 85 per cent 

And Valdano, who also played for Los Blancos, is convinced that Messi's problems run deeper than just one poor performance.

Speaking to Spanish newspaper Marca, the former Argentina international said: 'Looking at the last game, Messi is a little off-form. 

'His position has changed on the pitch and now his job is more to provide assists, but he has lost his ability to disrupt the defence – something which used to solve many past games for Barca.'

Messi was awarded the Golden Ball at the World Cup last summer after helping Argentina reach the final against Germany, but Valdano believes he was at far from his best in South America.

He added: 'In the Brazil World Cup we saw that something was up with Messi; he walked around the pitch. 

'He was physically not at his best and maybe that is the reason for playing further back, to not tire himself so much.'
