A young couple plunged 150ft down a clifftop as they tried to save their runaway puppy, an inquest has heard.

Civil engineer Rhys Clark was killed and his fiancée Anna Galazka was seriously injured as they tried to save their one-year-old dog Sherlock as he fell down the cliff face.

Witnesses told how they watched in horror as first Mr Clark and Miss Galazka slid down a steep grassy slope before tumbling over the clifftop Southerndown near Bridgend, South Wales.

The inquest heard Mr Clark, 27, shot headfirst onto rocks on the holiday beach with Miss Galazka, 25, crashing down after him seconds later.

Couple: The inquest heard Mr Clark, 27, fell onto rocks on the holiday beach at Southerndown with his girlfriend crashing after him seconds later. They had been trying to reach their puppy Sherlock, who they had just adopted

Mr Clark was killed instantly as he struck the rocks to just a few feet from the body of the mongrel Sherlock.

The couple had rescued Sherlock from an animal welfare centre just weeks earlier and loved taking him on walks.

Polish-born Miss Galazka had a miraculous escape but suffered multiple fractures, including a broken pelvis and broken leg.

The couple had been together for two-and-a-half years and planned to get married.

Miss Galazka was described by Mr Clark’s father at the inquest as the 'perfect partner' for his son.

He said: 'Anna is absolutely charming and was the perfect partner for Rhys.They were in love and Rhys said he planned to marry Anna.'

Schoolboy Archie White saw the tragedy unfold at the top of the steep cliffs.

Dangerous: The couple plunged over the 150ft cliff in South Wales after trying to catch their puppy. Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan coroner Thomas Atherton recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest today

Archie, 13, said: 'The man was running forwards and tried to grab the dog by the edge of the cliff but he was too slow.

'He scrambled down the steep side but was unable to stop himself and shot forward headfirst towards the rocks.'

Sam Clarke, who was rock climbing on the cliffs, told the 
inquest: 'The man was sliding feet first down the grassy bank.

Steep: Eyewitnesses told how they watched in horror as first Rhys and Anna slid down a steep grassy slope - before tumbling over the clifftop

'He
was sliding at some speed and appeared to be out of control as he tried
to stop himself before he went down the vertical cliff face.

'The woman also started to slide down the same grassy bank before she tumbled down the cliffs.'

The inquest heard that lifeguards on the beach tried to resuscitate Mr Clark before a doctor on the scene pronounced him dead from multiple injuries.

Miss Galazka was breathing and was airlifted to hospital by an air ambulance.

She is still recovering from her injuries and did not give evidence at the inquest.

Mr Clark had a First Class honours degree and First Class Masters in engineering from Cardiff University, where he met Miss Galazka three years ago.

The couple were planning to marry, 
have children and settle down in the Herefordshire countryside, where he 
had always dreamed of living.

The pair had a regular walk along the cliffs at Southerndown, which are a popular filming location for the TV show Dr Who.

Mr Clark was a volunteer during the London Olympics and Miss Galazka was in training for next year’s London Marathon.

Cardiff
and Vale of Glamorgan coroner Thomas Atherton, giving a verdict of 
accidental death, said: 'It is quite clear from the evidence that the 
dog ran towards the cliff edge and Rhys followed with tragic 
consequences.'
