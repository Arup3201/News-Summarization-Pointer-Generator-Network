Aristocratic singer Bo Bruce, runner-up in The Voice, has spoken about her relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge's family while she was a student at Marlborough College, the Wiltshire boarding school also attended by Kate, Pippa and James Middleton.

The elfin 28-year-old songwriter - the youngest daughter of the Earl of Cardigan, and christened Lady Catherine Anna Brudenell-Bruce - studied at £31,000-per-year Marlborough at the same time as the Middleton sisters, with whom she played hockey.

She said: 'They were nice to me. They were kind and I thought they were cool. I'll tell you who was really good to me - their parents. I was the little one on the team, and they always made sure I was all right.'

Speaking to Sarah Rainey in The Telegraph, Bruce, whose cousin is Florence Brudenell-Bruce, a former girlfriend of Prince Harry ('She's wonderful. I haven't seen her in so long; we only met when I was about 17. They're a really nice family'), explained that a difficult home life meant she was quite out of control at school, and was eventually 'asked to leave' aged 17.

She said: 'I went too far with drugs and alcohol and I had this terrible accident [reportedly an overdose] that really terrified me.

'I woke up in A&E and I was completely traumatised. School thought I was a drug addict and an alcoholic and I wasn't, but I didn't want to be there any more.'

It was after being sent to the Priory clinic in London and a rehabilitation centre in Arizona that Bruce began to work on music.

Bruce, whose first album Before I Sleep debuted in the top ten in the music charts last week, grew up in a 100-room mansion called Tottenham House in a 4,500-acre estate.

But life since her childhood has been turbulent.

Her parents separated in 2006, her estranged father David - who was last year declared 'mentally unfit' after accusations of criminal damage and theft - met his new wife in rehab, and the Earl is apparently working as a delivery man to supplement benefits.

Her beloved mother Rosmond died of pancreatic cancer in July 2012, just after The Voice, and Bruce has dedicated the album to her.

Speaking about her aristocratic family she calls it 'tragically disintegrated', and when referencing her father she says simply, 'I have no parents'.
