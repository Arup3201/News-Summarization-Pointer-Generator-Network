A 15-year-old accused of savagely beating his mother to death with a sledgehammer before setting his home on fire to kill his brother will be charged as an adult, a judge has decided.

A Juvenile Court Judge in Tennessee has found Zachary Davis' alleged crimes too severe to be helped by them, opting to try the teen from Hendersonville as an adult instead,Â WTVF reported.

'It was a horrific murder and the judge made the observation that it was a savage murder and that Zachary Davis could not be handled in the juvenile court and should go over to criminal court,' said Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley.

Charged: Zachery Davis, 15, will be charged as an adult in the death of his mother and attempted murder of his older brother last month

Murder: The teen's single mother Melanie Davis, 46, was grisly killed with a sledgehammer while she was sleeping in her bed

The ruling comes after a mental health evaluation that found the teen not disabled.

Davis' mother Melanie Davis, 46, was asleep in her bed on the night of August 10 when prosecutors say her son attacked, carefully locking the bedroom door behind.

He then went upstairs into his Hendersonville home's game room and set a fire they say, hoping it would consume his older brother who was asleep. His brother, who's currently staying with family friends, made it out uninjured.

Police reported that Zachary Davis was found a short distance later from the, holding a notebook that contained a written confession to the crime that included, according to an affidavit, 'leaving his brother to burn in the fire that he started.'

In court on Tuesday his defence argued the teen being as much victim as those affected that night, having lost his father to Lou Gehrig's disease in 2007 and struggling since.

'Any one person that encountered Zack - teachers, neighbours, immediate family - knew "something" was deeply wrong. His school knew. His mother knew. But nothing was done,' his attorney Randy Lucas said, according to WTVF.

'Now, transferred to the adult criminal justice system, he will get nothing in the way of rehabilitation, medication, or counseling,' he said.

He faces charges of first degree murder, criminal attempt to commit first degree murder and aggravated arson.
