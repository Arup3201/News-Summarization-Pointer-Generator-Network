Robin Thicke, 36, and Paula Patton, 38, have split.

On Monday the married couple of nine years - who were childhood sweethearts - announced they were separating.

'We will always love each other and be best friends, however, we have mutually decided to separate at this time,' they told People in a joint statement.

The news comes on the heels of several reports the 36-year-old crooner flirted behind the back of his 38-year-old actress wife.

Ever since his song Blurred Lines became a breakout hit in July 2013, the crooner has been caught in a series of bad situations.

Soon after Miley Cyrus twerked in his face and rubbed a foam finger on her private parts as she backed into him during the MTV Video Music Awards in August, he was caught with his hand on blonde socialite Lana Scolaro's derriere.

The inappropriate image was captured with the help of a mirror behind the married star as he smiled innocently for the camera.

To make matters worse, now the socialite has come forward to TMZ to reveal that she would like to go for a drink with the singer.

'I'd love to grab a drink with him if he asked,' she told the site.

She added: 'Robin acting like that with me makes me think there were many more. It's a shame because when you have a kid, it's upsetting.'

Also eyebrow raising was his late January flirtation with an exotic beauty inside the Parisian nightclub Club 79.

The singer was spotted 
embracing the looker, who had big hair and flashed a black bra. And then
 he was seen dirty dancing with her, grinning from ear to ear. Paula was
 nowhere in sight.

Though 
the longtime couple were seen arm-in-arm on January 25 at a Clive Davis 
party, just weeks later he was spotted without the Mission: Impossible -
 Ghost Protocol knockout when he went shopping with their son Julian, 
aged three, in West Hollywood on February 13.

Though they were man and wife for almost a decade, they met when he was only 14-years-old.

Five years after their 2005 wedding they welcomed Julian.

In 2013 the son of actor Alan Thicke said of Patton, 'We're pretty sure we've loved each other for a few lives.'

Thicke was also in the news Sunday after a student group asked Boston University to cancel his upcoming concert, according to FoxNews.

The group is claiming his Blurred Lines hit song - which he sung at the VMAs with Cyrus - are sexist.

'Lyrics
 such as, "I know you want it," explicitly use non-consensual language,'
 the petition said. 'And while watching the extremely explicit video, 
the insinuations grow from subtle to explicit to obnoxious.'

On Saturday he canceled a performance at Universal Studios, claiming he was having problems with his voice.

He said: 'I never want to let down my fans, but I have unfortunately lost my voice and cannot perform.

'I
have been looking forward to going to Universal Studios in Orlando and 
am very sorry that my concert there (Saturday) night now has to be 
canceled. I apologize to everyone.'

He was seen the following day at Disneyland with his little boy.
