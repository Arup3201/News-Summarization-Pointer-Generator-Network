George Zimmerman may have escaped prison time, but at least in lock-up he'd have a bed of his own.

Nearly one year after he was acquitted in the February 2012 shooting death of unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin, 30-year-old Zimmerman is reportedly homeless, unemployed and broke - with less than $1,000 to his name.

The sad details of Zimmerman's life post-trial were revealed in court documents filed as he begins divorce proceedings with wife Shellie.

While the soon to be ex-Mrs ZimmermanÂ  supported her husband during the trial last year, the two separated just two months after the July 2013 acquittal when he left her and started seeing someone new.

According to the financial affidavit Zimmerman filed last month, he only has $650 in his bank account, and $14,000 in assets which is mainly his 2008 Honda pickup.

Brother Robert Zimmerman Jr says he doesn't have a home, but rather moves around sleeping at the homes of friends a supporters.

Despite that, Zimmerman manages to spend more than $3,000 a month, with $100 each month on vacations and another $200 to psychological counseling. He spends an estimated $350 a month on medical care.

That kind of spending is shocking since Zimmerman claims he is $2.5million in debt, most of which is owed to defense attorneys Mark O'Mara and Don West.

A legal defense fund that raised over $400,000 has a balance of just $300 today.

It's unclear how Zimmerman continues to fund his lifestyle, as the affidavit says he has no current income.

He did sell a painting last December on eBay for $100,000 but the document didn't say where that money went.

All that remains: One of the only assets Zimmerman has left is his pickup truck, shown getting pulled over after his acquittal for a speeding
