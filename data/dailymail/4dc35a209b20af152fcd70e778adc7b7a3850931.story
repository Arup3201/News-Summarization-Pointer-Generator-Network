When Chanel launches a new make-up line, women usually queue round the block to snap it up.

After all, the brand's £19 Jade nail varnish had waiting lists thousands long.

So its brash new spring range, inspired by, er, butterflies, may come as a shock.

Would you try lemon lashes? Chanel says you would...

There's a garish gold lipstick, neon green eye shadow and Eighties-inspired mascaras in aqua, lime and - yep - bright lemon yellow.

Lashes that look like they've been dipped in egg-yolk? Yuck!

This is anything but mellow yellow.  This is high-vis jacket style electric yellow that would blind you every time you fluttered your lashes.

It's a look we fear even Kate Moss won't be able to pull off. So don't say we didn’t warn you...
