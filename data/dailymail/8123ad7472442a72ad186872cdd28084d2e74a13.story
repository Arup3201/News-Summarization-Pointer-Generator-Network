Sickening: Laura Partridge shows the horrific injuries inflicted by her violent boyfriend who attacked her in the toilet of their Leicester flat

These are the horrific injuries inflicted on a woman when she was ferociously beaten by her violent boyfriend.

Laura Partridge today told how she feared for her life as 'controlling and bullying' Lee Ashley Russell was jailed for three years for the attack.

His drink and drug-fuelled assault left her with multiple injuries, including fractures to her cheekbone, nose and eye socket.

She was so severely bruised her parents barely recognised her.

It was the culmination of months of violence against her by Russell, 43, at the home the pair shared in Leicester.

Following yesterday’s case at Leicester Crown Court, 32-year-old Laura said: 'I can never forgive him. I thought he was going to beat me to death.

'It’s left my life in tatters with panic attacks and flashbacks. I didn’t recognise the signs of how dangerous he was because I was so in love.

'I’d tell other women not to put up with violence from their men and get out early so they don’t end up like I did. You tell yourself it will get better, but it only gets worse.'

Laura’s parents, Kim and Steven Partridge said they were 'shocked and horrified' when they saw their battered and bruised daughter at hospital.

Mrs Partridge, 55, said: 'I walked down the corridor and she was sitting in a wheelchair waiting for a CT scan. I couldn’t believe what I saw. It took my breath away.'

Mr Partridge, 57, said: 'I felt pure rage that anyone could do such a thing.'

Laura is now trying to rebuild her life in a women’s refuge.

Fighting back tears, she said: 'If it wasn’t for my family, I’d think about ending it all. He’s stripped me of the person I was.'

After attending the court, she said her one-year relationship with Russell was at first 'brilliant' and she moved into his flat.

He then began losing his temper at the slightest incident until one day, when she burnt an omelette, he 'smashed up' the kitchen in a rage.

Matters came to a head on July 5 when the pair argued on their way for a drink with Laura’s friends and Russell stormed off.

She later returned to the flat to collect personal items before going to stay with her mother.

She did not realise Russell was at home or that he had consumed 12 pints of lager, amphetamine and cannabis.

He attacked her in the toilet because did not like the fact a male friend was waiting to drive her to her mother’s.

Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said: 'Russell launched a ferocious assault, repeatedly punching her head and face with both fists.'

Mr Murphy said: 'He was hitting her with full-force swings.'

She managed to leave the house and her friend took her to hospital.

Laura’s eye injuries have left her with double vision and she faces surgery.

Sentencing Russell, Judge Simon Hammond made an indefinite restraining order banning Russell, who admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm, from future contact with Laura.

He said: 'It was a vicious and prolonged attack. He showed her no mercy and I won’t show him any mercy. It was as bad a case of domestic violence as I’ve seen in a long time.'

He said Russell’s previous convictions included nine assaults, including an attack on a former partner in 1998.

Russell told a probation officer: 'She didn’t deserve what happened and I wish I could turn the clock back.'

Sally Bamford, mitigating, said Russell had issues with alcohol and as a child was the victim of domestic abuse from his father.
