Hearing: Jim Davies is suing Thames Valley Police over colleagues' use of the word 'traveller'

A policeman is suing his bosses after colleagues allegedly offended him by referring to Romany people as 'travellers'.

Jim Davies, an Englishman of Romany descent, accuses police staff of using the word 'pikey' to describe other members of the Romany community.

The speed enforcement officer is suing Thames Valley Police for racial discrimination over the use of the terms.

He outlined his case at a preliminary hearing today, where a panel is set to rule which parts of his evidence will be admissable at the full tribunal.

The officer, who lives in Brackley, Northamptonshire, told the hearing in reading that he was offended by hearing Romany people described as 'travellers'.

He claimed the term had been 'institutionalised' at the force over the 20 years he has worked there, and was a discriminatory reference to his own ethnicity.

Mr Davies said he could not remember the details of every alleged use of the word, but insisted that it was used 'on a frequent basis.'

At the preliminary hearing, a section from Mr Davies' claim was read out that said: 'I have continuously witnessed colleagues making offensive comments about travellers.'

He also claimed colleagues used the word 'pikey' as a derogatory term for Romany people.

A representative of Thames Valley Police argued that the use of the word 'traveller' referred to the whole community, not just those of Romany origin.

Claim: Mr Davies insists the word is offensive to Romany people and is suing for racial discrimination

James Arnold told the panel: 'What we have got is a generic use of the word traveller to describe those people living on traveller sites, regardless of ethnicity.'

However, the claimant is to argue that there were incidents when the term was used in a more specific context when it was likely to refer to Romany people.

Members of the Romany community are legally protected from unfair treatment under laws forbidding racial discrimination.

The Romany people live mostly in Europe and the Americas and have often suffered from discrimination.

Police officers regularly make offensive comments about travellers, the employment tribunal heard.

Mr Davies pointed the finger at nine colleagues he accused of making the derogatory remarks but claimed there had been countless insults aimed at travellers during his 20 years as a policeman, amounting to racial discrimination.

James Arnold, the TVP representative at the tribunal compared the case with a Scottish person being offended by the word 'gingers.'

However, Jack Feeny, representing Mr Davies, said: 'If everyone in the office is using the word ginger to describe Celtics that would be direct discrimination because they are attacking Celticism through a code word.

'There will be evidence to show that the use of the term ‘traveller’ by Thames Valley Police is synonymous with an ethnic group.

'Those police officers were not referring to new age travellers when they made the comments that the complainant complained about.'

Mr Arnold claimed that as soon as officers gave evidence that they did not know the term traveller related specifically to Romany people, the case would collapse.

Mr Davies is seeking compensation for injuries to his feelings by racial discrimination.

Nine colleagues of Pc Davies who have had allegations against them and expert witnesses on the use of the word traveller, were expected to be called to give evidence at the full 10-day hearing, which is due to start on June 30.
