A third relative has now been charged in the case of a 15-year-old mentally disabled girl who was found last month in Indiana weighing just 35lbs after enduring years of neglect and abuse.

Crystal Sells, 21, was arrested Thursday night on seven counts of battery, confinement and aiding/inducing or causing the neglect of a dependent causing serious bodily injury.

Investigators say Sells played a major role in the abuse targeting her special-needs niece.

The arrest comes a month after Sells' father, 58-year-old Steve Sells, and his wife, 54-year-old Joetta Sells, were charged with neglect for allegedly starving the man's 15-year-old granddaughter and keeping her locked away in a filthy room for four years.

Court documents indicate that the teenager was brutally beaten by her caretakers, lodged on a blood- and -feces-stained mattress and forced to eat human waste and go to the bathroom in a bucket.

According to probable cause affidavits, Crystal Sells was seen on one occasion striking her mentally disabled relative in the head with a plastic chair, WISH-TV reported. 

When questioned by police, Miss Sells admitted to the abuse and said that even after she had realized that what was being done to the girl was wrong, she did nothing to stop it.

‘There were clearly times over the course of the four years where she was involved in the batteries, she was involved in the criminal confinement and she clearly could have gotten help for this young girl if she chose to and did not,’ said Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings.

Court documents show that Joetta and Crystal Sells waited three hours to call an ambulance after the girl was found unresponsive December 1, giving them enough time to come up with a plausible story in order to avoid prison time, according to a relative.

That same relative said the women seemed more distraught by the prospect of going to jail than the girl’s appalling condition. 

'Cruel': Sells was granted custody of the children in 2009 when their mother abandoned them

Steve Sells, the girl's legal guardian since 2009, was initially charged with 12 counts of neglect and battery. On Tuesday, he was hit with additional charges of theft, perjury and welfare fraud for allegedly misusing his granddaughter's Social Security benefits totaling $55,000, according to WTHR.

His wife faces 11 felonies counts of neglect of a dependent, criminal confinement and battery resulting in bodily injury. The couple are being held on $100,000 bonds.

Mr Sells was awarded custody of the girl after claiming that his daughter, Jannifer Sells, had abandoned her

Speaking to Fox 59 earlier this week, Miss Sells said she was shocked to discover that her father allegedly had been abusing his own granddaughter.

According to the woman and her fiance, the 15-year-old has been in the hospital for more than a month now recovering from her injuries.

Last month, doctors at Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital recommended taking the teenager off life support, so grave was her condition, but around New Year’s Eve she girl rallied.

The 15-year-old is now said to be awake and capable of getting out of bed.

Jannifer Sells and her husband-to-be Anthony Gaw said they want the girl to come live with them once she regains her health. 

The Sells family allegedly kept the teenager locked in a room with only a mattress, space heater, blankets, a bowl with oatmeal and a bucket, according to the documents first shared by Fox59 last month.

Scene: Sells allegedly locked his granddaughter in an upstairs bedroom without enough heat. When detectives searched the house, they found a mattress, a bucket and a bowl of oatmeal in the bedroom

Authorities noted that the door had a lock at the top, out of reach of the teenager, and another child at the home said Sells would lock the door 'during the day and nights'.

The child told authorities that they would sometimes see the girl's fingers reaching around the door, in an apparent attempt to get out, the documents said.

Everything inside the room was covered with feces and blood, authorities said. 

The gruesome conditions were unearthed after concerned relatives took the girl to hospital December 1 and doctors contacted authorities. They then executed a search warrant at the home.

When the girl was taken to St. Vincent Hospital in Anderson, she was covered in feces and weighed just 35lb. She was then flown to Peyton Manning Children's Hospital in Indianapolis in critical condition. 

When police arrived, they said the girl was so thin that bones were protruding from her skin.

'If you see pictures of the victim, it's very disturbing,' Sgt. Joel Sandefur said told the Indy Channel. 'We wouldn't accept treatment of an animal that way, let alone a human being, a 15-year-old girl.'

The teenager and a four-year-old child moved in with the couple when their mother abandoned them four years ago, according to the court documents.

The older girl, whose grandfather said suffers from a chromosome problem in her brain, was kept locked up inside the room by Steve Sells, according to his wife of six years.

She had not been to the doctors or to school in two years, the Indy Channel reported. 

He told authorities he locked her in the room to protect himself, claiming that the 35lb girl was strong and had previously approached him with a knife. 

The Department of Child Services asked for a court hearing regarding custody of the girl in 2011, Fox59 reported.

Jannifer Sells and her fiance said they want the girl to come live with them once she feels better 

'I think they were asking for court intervention for them to be permitted to take the child out of that environment or to get services and the court did not permit that to happen at that time,' said Prosecutor Cummings - but the child ultimately stayed at the home. 

Neighbor Thomas McAllister told said that Sells and his wife lived at the home with their three children. He said that Sells had always given the impression he was a caring father.

'That is mind boggling,' he added. 'That is just disgusting and no child should have to go through anything like that.'
