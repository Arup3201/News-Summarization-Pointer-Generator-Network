A fit and healthy PE teacher lives under the dark cloud of her skin cancer returning, having suffered four bouts of the disease - despite never using a sunbed.

Becky Giddins' melanoma relapsed three times since she was first diagnosed in April 2007.

The 32-year-old suffered her fourth relapse in January, just a week after returning from her honeymoon.

As the cancer spread Mrs Giddins had to have a lumpectomy, a third of her left lungs and her lymph glands removed.

Becky Giddins has survived four bouts of skin cancer, despite using sunbeds. Today the 32-year-old is raising money and awareness to help others fighting the disease. She was first diagnosed with melanoma when in April 2007

Since being diagnosed Mrs Giddins, 32, has had a lumpectomy, half of her left lung and her lymph glands removed

Reliving her diagnosis, she said: 'When they told me it was cancer I didn’t know how to react - I was on my own and it really didn’t sink in.

'It only hit me when the doctors told me the mole was cancerous and it had be removed.

'I was completely shocked, but relieved that they had removed it.

'I have never been on a sunbed in my life - not even to build up a base tan before going on holiday.

'As part of my job and coaching I’m outside a lot but, because I’m naturally fairly skinned, I’ve always worn sunscreen.'

The skin cancer was first discovered after a weird mole on Mrs Giddins’ calf changed colour and became scabby.

On visiting the doctor, a biopsy confirmed the growth was cancerous which meant the mole was removed along with a surrounding 2cm of skin.

Following the operation, the teacher from Kidderminster in the West Midlands, lived cancer free for almost five years.

In that time she met her future husband, Kevin.

Over Christmas in 2011 - one week before her final CT scan to check whether she was in remission - Mrs Giddins found a lump in her groin.

After a biopsy showed the melanoma had returned and spread to her lymph nodes, both were removed in February 2012 and a drain was fitted in her leg to remove lymph fluid.

Mrs Giddins said: 'The second time round I kept scaring myself looking things up on the internet and making myself quite upset.

'Having the drain attached was horrible - I was permanently carrying this bag round me which was collection the fluid.

'I refused to let it get me down though, so when me and the girls went out for my 30th birthday I bought an over the shoulder bag to cover it up.'

Despite her cancer and the treatment she was undergoing Mrs Giddins continued to coach and play netball.

After the drain was removed, she said she felt her freedom return. She was positive, hearing from surgeons that the area was now clear from cancer.

Her latest treatment to have a lump on her breast and part of her lung removed took place six weeks before her wedding to Kevin, in August last year

Mrs Giddins returned to her job at a secondary school in Kidderminster, and she and her husband returned to their normal lives.

On Christmas Day 2012 - three years after getting together - 32-year-old Mr Giddins proposed and the couple started planning their wedding for August 2013.

But, as preparations intensified and the hunt for wedding dresses continued, the couple received the devastating news following a routine CT scan, that the cancer had spread to her lung.

Six weeks before her big day, Mrs Giddins had a third of her left lung removed and a lumpectomy on her right breast, throwing the wedding into jeopardy.

Melanoma is a rare cancer that begins in the skin and can spread to other organs in the body.

The most common sign of the disease is a new mole or a change in an existing mole.

This can happen anywhere on the body, but is most often found on the back, legs, arms and face.

In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and are more than one colour.

They also tend to be larger than normal moles and can be itchy or bleed.

Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally.

It is not known what causes the cancer, but it is thought exposure to UV light from natural or artifical souces may be partly responsible.

There are around 13,000 new cases diagnosed in the uK every year.

Melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people aged 15 to 34 and is also responsible for most skin cancer deaths.

More than 2,000 people a year die in the UK as a result of melanoma.

She said: 'After the operation I didn’t know whether I would be able to walk down the aisle, but the thought of marrying the love of my life really pulled me through.

'When me and Kevin got together I didn’t class myself as a cancer patient as the mole had been gone for two years.

'When it returned though, Kevin was a rock for me - along with my family - and I just wanted to marry him and celebrate our relationship no matter what.'

Despite tying the knot in August 2013, their dream honeymoon had to be postponed as Becky could not fly for at least eight weeks post-surgery.

Finally, on Christmas Day the pair jetted off to Las Vegas to celebrate their nuptials in style.

There Mrs Giddins developed a pain in her side, and in spite of initially passing it off as a urine infection she felt a nagging that it was something more serious.

But two days after returning home, doctors confirmed the melanoma had spread to her liver and urethra.

She said: 'I don’t like complaining but it just feels like me and Kevin can’t enjoy anything together.

'I’m now on Dabrasenib and Trametinib to try and cure me, but if they don’t work there’s currently only one last set of drugs we can try.

'I’m well aware I’m a bit of a ticking time bomb, but I just want to live a normal life, do a bit of travelling and keep playing netball.'

The teacher is working to raise awareness of skin cancer, starting a fund, to which £2,500 has already been donated, for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Charity's Skin Cancer Fund.

Along with his brother Ian, cousin and five close friends, Mr Giddins will climb the highest peaks in England, Wales and Scotland in July.
