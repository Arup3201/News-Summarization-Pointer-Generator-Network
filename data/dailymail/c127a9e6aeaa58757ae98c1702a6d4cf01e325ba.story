A tree outside a cathedral that began dripping last week has attracted crowds of parishioners who say it is crying God's tears.

Clear liquid began falling from the crape myrtle tree opposite St John's Cathedral in Fresno, CA, last Wednesday, prompting worshippers to declare it a 'miracle' and a sign that God was manifesting himself on earth.

But a tree specialist who examined it said the liquid was not salt water but excrement from the aphids that covered its trunk and branches.

Worshippers in hope of a miracle have flocked to the tree in Fresno, CA, after it began dripping a clear liquid

The liquid was first spotted leaking from the crape myrtle tree opposite St John's Cathedral on Wednesday

The tree, outside St John's Cathedral in Fresno, throws out water when you pray, according to Maria Ybarra

Arborist Jon Reelhorn told wptv.com the drips were a form of honeydew secreted by aphids after they drank the sap from the myrtle tree.

He said: 'The aphids will suck the sap, the sap goes through the aphid and then it is a honey dew excrement from the aphid and it gets so heavy in the summertime that it will drip down.'

The church-goers who have flocked to the tree, some in search of a cure for their ailments, disagree.

Maria Ybarra told the television channel: 'When you say "Glory be to God in Jesus' name" the tree starts throwing out more water.'

She added: 'I can tell you looking at it from a scientific standpoint and a spiritual standpoint it is the work of God manifesting here on earth.'

Tree of hope: Believers, some of them sick, are now flocking to the tree on the Fresno sidewalk to pray

Arborist Jon Reelhorn says the dripping liquid is honeydew, or undigested tree sap from aphids

Aphids produce honeydew after feeding on plant sap - the undigested, sugary liquid is forced out of their gut

Another parishioner, Rosemarie Navarro, who attends a Catholic church in Fresno, believes the tree has power from God.

Ms Navarro, who says she is seriously unwell, went to pray under the tree in the hope that what she believes are tears from God might cure her.

A clinical therapist told the TV station that it was natural for humans to want to believe in something they could not see, because humans need to hope.

In the Bible, the Israelites encountered a white, honey-tasting substance that may well have been honeydew as they walked through the desert after the Exodus.
