A family have ‘adopted’ one of Britain’s rarest creatures which has visited their garden every day for the last month - a black squirrel.

The mutant rodent, which is a grey squirrel with a specific genetic defect, has been named Sooty by the Papps.

Husband and wife David and Yvette live with their three children Vicki, 27, Sarah, 25, and Charlie, 22, in Hayes, west London.

Creative technician Vicki said: 'At first I thought it was a rat. But then I saw the big bushy tail.

'I never knew you could get black squirrels.

'He seems pretty happy though - he’s back in our garden every day.

'We put nuts and food out for him and his pals, and he seems very happy. Sometimes he’s with a pair of grey squirrels.

'He’s a lovely little creature, and I hope he keeps coming back. He’s like our pet.'

Black squirrels were first spotted in the wild in Britain Bedfordshire, around 1912, when a couple of the genetic mutants escaped after being brought over from America.

It is thought there are same number of black squirrels as there are red squirrels in the wild, mostly in south east England.

Black squirrels originate from North America and are the same species as grey squirrels.

The only difference is they have a piece of DNA missing on a gene that produces pigment, meaning they can only produce black fur.

The grey squirrel is a native of North America but has become a well established invader in the British Isles.

Between 1876 and 1929 more than 100 grey squirrels were introduced to more than 30 different sites across England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland.

There are now more than two million grey squirrels in the British Isles where they continue to spread and their numbers continue to rise.

The black squirrel is the same species as the grey squirrel and they interbreed normally. 

Scientists at Anglia Ruskin University discovered that the difference between the black and grey squirrel is genetic; black squirrels have a piece of DNA missing on a gene involved in producing pigment.

Black squirrels are commonly found in North America particularly in the colder northern parts of the continent.

About a dozen black squirrels from North America were released in Woburn, Bedfordshire about a 100 years ago, the first recorded sighting being in 1912.

Black squirrel numbers have risen steadily over the years and they have been a common sight in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire for many decades now.

Although black squirrels are spreading they are not found anywhere else in the British Isles.

The mutated gene has travelled about 50 miles in 100 years and so the gene is travelling at about half a mile a year.
