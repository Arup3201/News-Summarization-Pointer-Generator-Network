Ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak's health has deteriorated further in prison, it emerged today.

Doctors treating the former president have had to use a defibrillator twice and feed him liquids intravenously, Egyptian security officials said.

The 84-year-old's condition has declined rapidly since he was last seen publicly eight days ago, when he was jailed for life.

In decline: Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's health is said to have deteriorated since he was pictured at his trial last month

He was imprisoned for failing to stop the killing of hundreds of demonstrators as his regime crumbled during last year's Arab Spring.

The security officials said Mubarak's two sons, one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa, were by his side at the intensive care ward of Torah prison hospital, south of Cairo.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, they did not say whether the defibrillator was used because Mubarak's heart stopped or to remedy irregular heartbeats.

He has reportedly suffered from breathing problems since his sentence was passed, with doctors having to use a respirator to help him.

The update on Mubarak's condition came a day after authorities granted his wife, former first lady Suzanne Mubarak, and the couple's two daughters-in-law special permission to visit him.

Mubarak ruled Egypt for almost 30 years, but his authoritarian regime was overthrown in February last year after tens of thousands of protesters demonstrated in Cairo's Tahrir Square and elsewhere.

Demonstrators returned to the square last week after Mubarak was jailed for life but cleared of corruption.

After a year-long trial, which the former leader attended in his hospital bed, a court convicted him of complicity in the killing of 850 demonstrators.

Gamal and Alaa were acquitted of corruption charges but are also being held in Torah, awaiting a separate trial on charges of insider trading.

The verdicts sparked a new wave of protests by Egyptians who allege it was determined by political pressure from the country's military rulers, helping their former president.

Protesters chanted: 'A farce a farce, this trial is a farce' and 'The people want execution of the murderer'.

Mubarak is the first Arab leader to be tried by his own people.

His life sentence saw him transferred immediately to a prison hospital, instead of the military hospital and other facilities where he had been held since his April 2011 arrest.

Authorities are said to have turned down several requests by Mubarak's family to transfer the ousted president back to a military facility.

Mubarak, a former military commander, came to power in 1981 following the assassination of President Anwar El Sadat.

His regime was widely unpopular, but observers say conditions in Egypt have deteriorated since he was deposed.

The country has been hit by a wave of deadly protests and strikes, battering its economy.
