Many artists claim their work is their life, but this photographer travelled by foot, small plane, canoe and even hot air balloon to catch extraordinary images of landscapes, wildlife and remote communities. 

Brazilian Sebastião Salgado spent eight years, making 32 trips to some of the world’s most far-flung locations to create his epic photography project Genesis.

His photographic mission tested his endurance - he spent three days trapped in Antarctic ice after his boat became stuck as well carrying out a two-month, 850km walk in the highlands of northern Ethiopia.

Labour of love: Many artists claim their work is their life, but this photographer travelled by foot, small plane, canoe and even hot air balloon to catch extraordinary images of landscapes, wildlife and remote communities

The result is 200 black and white 
photographs celebrating the glory of nature while examining the 
fragility of the natural world.

Genesis explorations lead him to think there are lessons Westerners can learn from other societies, such as the Amazonian Zoé tribe.

‘The populations I was photographing were so mobile – but we sit all day, we become heavy, we eat bad food with lots of chemicals inside,’ he told Metro.

‘We can slowly change the model of our way of life.’

During the 8 years in which Salgado travelled around the world to produce this collection of images, he often stayed with the people he photographed.

The exhibition's design follows the 5 themes in Genesis: Sanctuaries, Planet South, Africa, Northern Spaces, and Amazonia and Pantanal.

'Many of us live in cities, cut off completely from the planet. My wish was to experience living with people with real links to nature... For me to go back to nature was a huge pleasure. I wished to present the planet in my language, photography. And so came Genesis,' he said.

His project is now being presented by the Natural History Museum, which also uses its collections to explore the environment.
