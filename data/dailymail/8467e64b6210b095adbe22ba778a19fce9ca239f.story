Imagine living in a sustainable city with legs that could move anywhere in search of better jobs and resources.

Your postcode would constantly change as you’re taken around the world on board a gigantic caterpillar-like metropolis.

It might seem like an absurd concept, but this is exactly what is being proposed by Madrid-based architectural student Manuel Dominguez. 

Architectural student Manuel Dominguez has proposed the development of a sustainable city with legs that could move anywhere in search of a better resources

In his vision, the nomadic city would use caterpillar tracks – similar to the ones used for tanks – to move to areas were work for residents is easily available.

'I wanted to built territorial management between matter and energy, that will bring several positive effects,' Mr Dominguez told MailOnline.

'These include re-equilibrating the population between rural and cities, environment renewal and offering new employment,'  

Named the ‘Very Large Structure’, the walking metropolis would have everything you’d expect from a city, including sports facilities, restaurants, universities, hospitals and libraries.

This basic structure, built on caterpillar tracks, could provide one way of moving an entire city around the world in search of resources

This isn’t the first time someone 
has come up with the idea of a moving city. British architect Ron 
Herron’s ‘Walking City’ was first proposed in the 1960s.

In the architecture journal Archigram, Mr Herron suggested building huge intelligent robotic structures that could freely roam the world.

He proposed that various walking cities could interconnect with each other to form larger 'walking metropolises' when needed, and then disperse.

The ‘Very Large Structure’ develops Herron’s vision by proposing clean energy generation on board using wind turbines, solar panels and hydrogen energy plants.

Mr Dominguez said that the fact that the city moves around could be a way to encourage reforestation rather than destroying the surrounding environment.

The design may look like a bizarre concept, but with a number of the world's major cities in the midst of a slowdown, it may not be as futuristic as you might think

It can be easy to dismiss the design as yet another student project. But according to Mr Dominguez, the Very Large Structure is theoretically possible to build. 

'Even though I am very attracted to science fiction and utopical and distopical architecture, I was more interested in investigating real life technology,'  Mr Dominguez told MailOnline.

'These included open-air mining machinery, shipyard installations, logistic and management in super-ports and super vessels, space technology and  eco-villages.'

'I think it could exist some day maybe at other scale,' added Mr Dominguez.

'Maybe in the way it relates and deals with territory, maybe the way in which we built and think about architecture and urbanism, maybe in the way we manage energy and waste.'
