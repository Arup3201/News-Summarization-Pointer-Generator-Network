A watering hole called the ‘PoundPub’ which is set to sell pints of beer for just £1.50 and halves for a £1 could be the cheapest in the UK.

The pub, currently Georgia Browns on Dovecot Street in Stockton-on-Tees, will be re-branded as PoundPub and a licensing variation is being sought to allow beer to be sold from 8am.

The marketing concept is already causing concern among local councillors worried it will give the town centre - currently undergoing a £38m refurbishment - the wrong image.

Stockton-on-Tees pub Georgia Browns could soon begin selling pints from £1.50 - and become the cheapest watering hole in the UK - after changing its name to PoundPub

Stockton borough councillor Phil Dennis, said he was also worried alcohol would be sold too cheaply - and concerned about the clientele that the pub would attract.

'I am very concerned about the price point a unit of alcohol in this proposal.

'I have initial doubts and concerns about the ability of such a venue to control the environment where effectively we are selling at a point where the quality of clientele will likely match the price of the product on offer,' he said.

Councillor Phil Dennis raised concerns about the pub. He said: 'The quality of clientele will likely match the price of the product on offer'

Ken Lupton, leader of the council’s Tory group, said: 'An individual pub with such a pricing policy would only be detrimental to the general improvement the council hopes to achieve with their significant investment in the High Street.'

Mike Wardell, a director at Here for Your Hospitality Ltd which owns the premises, insisted that the pub would take part in responsible drinking campaigns, including challenging anyone who looked under-25 for identity.

He added that anyone who was drunk would not be served.

Mr Wardell also pointed out that supermarkets are able to sell their own value beers at 40p a can - something which is not monitored by councils.

Mr Wardell said the PoundPub is aimed at the kind of person who would have frequented Working Men’s Clubs in a previous generation and not at the night-time market.

He said: 'It is an eye-catching logo and, I suppose it’s a bit cheesy, but the phrase we’re going for is ‘get more round for your pound’.

'At a time when 12 pubs a week are closing across the country we have to think outside the box a bit.'

The PoundPub is expected to open over the Easter period and will have traditional pub games such as darts and billiards.
