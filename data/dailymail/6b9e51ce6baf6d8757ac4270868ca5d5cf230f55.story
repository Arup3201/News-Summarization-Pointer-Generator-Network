Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, pictured earlier this year on a visit to Pentonville Prison, wants ex-inmates to mentor other criminals

Former prisoners are to be paid to persuade other convicts to not to reoffend, it emerged today.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today defended the decision to use ‘old lags’ to stop criminals returning to jail again and again.

He claimed the policy is part of a major overhaul of offender rehabilitation and would give the taxpayer value for money.

Every prisoner leaving jail will now be monitored for a year after release under changes announced in yesterday’s Queen’s Speech.

The probation service will be opened up to private firms who will be paid on their success at stopping criminals reoffending.

The Offender Rehabilitation Bill clears the way for companies and charities to reverse the trend which last year saw 200,000 offences committed by someone who had already served lengthy terms in jail.

There will be a new licence period and the supervision order last for a year for offenders who spend less than 12 months in prison.

For those jailed for one to two years, they will be subject to a licence period for 12 months instead of six.

Drug addict offenders will be forced to attend treatment appointments, with testing covering Class B as well as Class A drugs.

Mr Grayling insisted pilot schemes had proved paying ex-inmates to mentor other offenders helped to cut crime.

He told MPs: ‘You need to go and look, not in the world of big business but in the voluntary sector, where some of our first-rate charities have got living examples today of former offenders who have gone straight and are now helping turn the lives around of a next generation of offenders.

‘I want to capture those skills in helping bring down reoffending.’ He also wants to see prisoners who can read teaching those who cannot.

The Justice Secretary said the coalition did not believe all problems would be solved by ‘throwing money" at them.

Will paying former prisoners to help rehabilitate other convicts reduce reoffending rates?

‘Are we actually saying it is not possible to run the system more efficiently and deliver support where it is needed to the offenders most likely to reoffend when they leave prison?’ he said.

He attacked Labour MPs who called for more funding for probation schemes. ’They think it is just a question of spending more taxpayers' money, higher taxes. We want to get better value for the taxes we already raise.’

But Mr Grayling was accused of sacking professional probation officers and paying former prisoners to take their place.

Labour's shadow justice minister Andy Slaughter criticised the plan to cut the rate of reoffending

Shadow justice minister Andy Slaughter questioned the costs and merits of the Government's new prisoner rehabilitation plans.

He said: ‘Professional probation officers sacked and replaced by ex-offenders. Is this your brave new world?

‘Unfortunately, it's a programme based on fewer resources, untried and untested methods, and putting faith in exactly those private sector organisations that have failed to deliver other major public sector contracts,’ he said.

Ministers say all offenders who enter prison, even for just a few days, will be subject to new supervision and will be given support through housing, employment, training and substance abuse programmes.

The reforms, to be rolled out across England and Wales by 2015, will see around 65,000 offenders serving sentences of up to two years receive extended rehabilitation.

Tory MP Philip Davies said there should be longer prison sentences as figures suggest these reduce rates of re-offending.

He said: ‘The longer people spend in prison the less likely they are to re-offend, largely because it gives them the time to do things like teach people to read whilst they are in prison before they are released.’

Mr Grayling said the length of time people had been spending in prison was increasing and he agreed they needed to take the opportunity to turn around the lives of people in jail.
