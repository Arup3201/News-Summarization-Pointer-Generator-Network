Carlo Ancelotti is widely acknowledged as one of the most successful names in world football.

The Real Madrid manager represented Italy at the 1990 World Cup, captained Roma during an eight-year spell at Stadio Olimpico, before turning his hand to management and excelling at that too.

And now the 55-year-old has been rewarded with a place in the Italian Football Hall of Fame.

Ancelotti was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame on Monday after a remarkable career to date 

His career began in 1976 - 39 years ago - in the youth ranks of Parma, before he earned a move to Roma in 1979. Eight years there, followed by five at AC Milan; Ancelotti is truly a stalwart of Italian football.

He made 26 appearances for his national team, culminating in a place in the World Cup squad on home soil at Italia 90. Ancelotti will donate his shirt from that tournament to the Football Museum 'as a token of my appreciation.'

Moving into management, Ancelotti has taken charge of some of the biggest football clubs in the world; Parma (his first professional club), Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris St Germain, and latterly Real Madrid, where his team have been hailed as the best there is.

It was announced in November that Ancelotti would be inducted, and the ceremony took place in Florence on Monday.

Ancelotti posed with his Italia 90 shirt in front of the words, 'Hall of Fame del Calcio Italiano'; 'Italian Football Hall of Fame'.

Three star names were inducted on Monday; Ancelotti as coach of the year, Diego Maradona as the best foreign player, and Fabio Cannavaro as an Italian player.
