Manchester United have seen a drastic fall in broadcasting revenues due to a lack of Champions League football, the club's latest financial figures show.

The Old Trafford outfit's debt has also risen by almost £24m in the space of three months.

Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, however, pointed to the new Premier League TV deal and 'strong revenues' which he said demonstrate they are in a strong position.

But executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is optimistic for the future with the club's 'strong revenues'

Woodward also says that United are in a strong place for a top-four finish this season under Louis van Gaal

He added that Louis van Gaal's men are now well-positioned for a top-four finish.

The figures are for the second quarter of the financial year.

Broadcasting revenue dropped from £46.9m for the same period last term to £28.4m, a fall of 39.4 per cent while matchday revenue dipped from £33.7m to £30.9m.

Woodward put that down to a lack of Champions League football at Old Trafford after last season's seventh-placed finish.

United predict that revenues for this season will be between £385m and £395m which would be a drop of around £40m from the previous campaign.

But officials believe that with the new TV deal secured and cash from their world-record £750m kit deal with adidas to drop, the future looks bright.

With regards to the debt, which is up from £356.6m to £380.5m, they claim it is down to the strength of the US dollar and are known to be comfortable with the situation which can potentially be beneficial for tax purposes.

Woodward said: 'The recently announced Premier League broadcasting rights package for 2017-19, representing an increase just over 70%, once again demonstrates that we are part of the top football league in the world.

'Notwithstanding no European football this season, our Revenues and EBITDA remain strong and demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model, with commercial revenues up year over year. On the pitch, the team is well positioned to challenge for a top four finish in the Premier League and we look forward to the rest of the season.'

United also lost around £1.2m in merchandising thanks mainly to the terms of thier existing deal with Nike that features penalties for non-participation in the Champions League.
