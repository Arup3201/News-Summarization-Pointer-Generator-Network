A wallet and passport belonging to a British tourist have been found in Switzerland – 18 years after they were lost during a trip to the mountains.

The man lost his leather wallet – containing his British passport, credit cards and receipts – while travelling by train from Zurich Airport to Geneva in 1996.

Back then, John Major was still the UK's prime minister, pop group Take That announced their break-up and England hosted Euro ‘96.

After 18 years the man’s wallet was finally handed in to police when it was found on the floor of a shopping centre in the picturesque town of Chur last month.

Local police announced this week that they have tracked down the unnamed man via the internet and returned the wallet to him.

The British man now resides somewhere in the US and he told police: 'If only my wallet could speak.'

A police spokesman told Switzerland's SDA news agency: ‘We have no idea how it found its way from the train to a shopping centre.

‘But the man was surprised and delighted to have it back, although the passport and credit cards had of course long expired.’

Even though it was missing for nearly two full decades, it appears the mysterious wallet contained all of its original contents, based on a photo provided by police.

Police said it remained in good condition with little signs of use.
