Elaine Silets is a train lover like no other. Not only did she make a career out of building model train displays but her expansive estate is an homage to the locomotive.

And over the weekend, Silets did something she does but once per year: she opened up her gardens to the public and something like 6,000 curious train lovers descended on her home.

With10 acres of gardens, waterfalls, lakes, trestles, bridges, and replica towns and pastoral scenes, her Glorée & Tryumfant Garden Railway in North Barrington, Illinois, it’s no wonder they call her the Train Lady.

Elaborate: About 6,000 visitors got a chance to view Elaine Silets' elaborate, train display-covered estate outside Chicago Saturday

Silets began her new life as the Train Lady after her beloved late husband Harvey’s law career took off, leaving her in search of a hobby.

That hobby became Huff & Puff Industries, a company that designs and manufactures model railroads for home and garden displays.

Huff & Puff’s work has been seen in the Nieman Marcus Christmas book, in the lobby of Chicago’s Hancock Center, and in Tiffany & Co. window displays.

Serious business: Silets (pictured) turned a love of trains into a famous business that creates high-end train displays, one of which even appeared in Chicago's Hancock Center lobby

Expansive: The ten acre Glorée & Tryumfant Garden Railway features Japanese gardens, waterways, topiaries, and seemingly endless displays, all with model trains chugging through year round

Intricate: Miniature people even populate the model train worlds

But Silets’ biggest accomplishment is her own garden display.

Eleven model trains chug about the lavish gardens all-year round.

The half-inch G-scale trains ply a Japanese water garden with waterfalls, a pond garden, rose gardens, a Snoopy topiary built especially for Silets’ grandsons, and other floral landscapes.

Also open to the day’s visitors was the private train museum on Silets’ propertyThe Harvey M. Silets Memorial museum was
built in honor of the Train Lady’s husband, a famous attorney who once 
represented Jimmy Hoffa. The museum is a scaled down replica of Greater 
Chicago that has 16 trains of its own, a drive-in movie theatre, and 
other transit-related exhibits like elevated trains and subway trains.

Durable: There are many water features in Silets' gardens. The trains that chug over and around them run all year round

Down to business: Though Silets (left) has plenty of personal passion for her trains, they are also her business. Huff & Puff Industries (right) creations have appeared in Chicago's Hnacock Center, Tiffany's window displays, and on the Oprah Winfrey Show, The Today Show, NBC, CNN, CBS, FOX, NBC, the Travel Channel, and PBS

Choo-choo: Silets preoccupation, before it was an occupation, began when her husband's law career took off, leaving her with time on her hands

For visitors, the once a year opportunity was well worth the $10 entrance fee.

‘It was fun,’ young Ethan Sparks told the Barrington Courier-Review as he reluctantly stepped off a replica Hogwarts Express train, inspired by the Harry Potter film and book series

Visitors continually thanked Silets for inviting the public onto her estate.

‘I always feel like Queen Elizabeth for a day,’ Silets said.

She even offered tips on how to create one’s own Glorée & Tryumfant Garden.

In Memoriam: Elaine Silets, known as the Train Lady, maintains her huge, locomotive gardens in part as a memorial to her late husband Harvey, a lawyer who once defended Jimmy Hoffa

High flying: Like the bustling metropolis of Chicago, which is close by, Silets' garden has elevated trains as well as purely terrestrial ones

‘I tell everyone it’s real easy,’ she said. ‘All you need is to live here 40-plus years, and buckets of money.’

‘I’ve lived here 44 years now,’ Silets clarified. ‘There was almost nothing here — the pond was here and a shabby, 1,000-square-foot house.’

And no matter how much her home and gardens are appreciated by visitors, Silets seems to love it all the most.

‘I live in heaven,' she said. 'I do. Isn’t it beautiful?'

Proceeds from Saturday’s event will go toward providing scholarships to promising artists who hope to attend the prestigious Interlochen Summer Arts Camp in Michigan, of which Silets is an alum, but who don’t have the financial ability.
