Nicklas Bendtner looks to have played his last game for Arsenal after the club opened an internal investigation into bizarre allegations about his conduct on a night out in Copenhagen.

Danish tabloid BT claims the 26-year-old centre forward threatened a taxi driver while his  team-mates were getting knocked out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich on Tuesday night.

During the incident, it is alleged that Bendtner unbuttoned his trousers, rubbed himself against the side of the cab and whipped the vehicle with his belt.

Benched: Bendtner has been accused of threatening a taxi driver in Copenhagen

Game for a laugh: But Bendtner looks set to leave Arsenal in the summer

The taxi driver was quoted in BT as 
saying: ‘I’ve seen drunks and alcoholics in Copenhagen  for over 25 
years, but I’ve never experienced anything like it.’

Bendtner did not travel to Germany due to a suspected knee injury. Arsenal will fine him heavily if he is guilty of wrongdoing.

The alleged incident is likely to hammer the final nail in the coffin of Bendtner’s career at the club.

Manager
 Arsene Wenger, who is said to be deeply concerned by the accusations, 
questioned Bendtner at the club’s London Colney HQ yesterday as Arsenal 
continued their probe.

Back on the pitch: Bendtner was with the Denmark squad last week on international duty

Arsenal
 have been desperate to permanently off-load the Dane for more than two 
years — but his £52,000-a-week wages have proved the stumbling block. 
His contract expires this summer and he will not be offered a new one.

Olivier Giroud and Yaya Sanogo are ahead of him in the pecking order, so Bendtner will only play in an emergency this season.

Goalkeeper
 Lukasz Fabianski, whose deal expires this summer,  is set to leave 
after he rejected a new three-year contract. Arsenal wanted to extend 
the Pole’s stay, offering to increase his £50,000-a-week wages. But 
Fabianski does not want to spend another season on the Gunners bench 
behind first choice Wojciech Szczesny.

Fabianski,
 28, has a number of offers on the table, with Schalke, Basle, 
Villarreal and Sevilla all keen on the keeper, who would consider 
staying in England.

Loan spell: Bendtner spent time in Italy with Juventus in the Serie A

And another: The Dane also played for Sunderland for a temporary spell in the North East

The 
futures of defenders Bacary Sagna and Thomas Vermaelen are still 
unresolved. Arsenal will make a final offer to Sagna, who has refused 
two others. The latest is a two-year deal on the same £60,000-a-week 
pay. He wants a three-year deal at £90,000 a week.

France
 international Sagna wants his future resolved before the World Cup. He 
is open to staying but knows he can get better deals elsewhere, namely 
Monaco, Galatasaray and Inter Milan.

Vermaelen’s
 advisers are lining up the Arsenal skipper’s next move. He has been on 
the sidelines for most of the season due to Per Mertesacker and Laurent 
Koscielny’s outstanding partnership. The Belgian will hold talks with 
Wenger at the end of the season. But his representatives are making 
moves to ensure he has  other offers if he leaves Arsenal.
