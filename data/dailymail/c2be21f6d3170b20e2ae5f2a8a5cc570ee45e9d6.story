A former inmate of Kerobokan prison has told of how he was baptised by Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan who helped him kick his 20-year drug addiction, and called on the Indonesian government to show the Australian mercy.

When Matius Arif Mirdjaja first spoke to Andrew Chan in prison in 2011 he mocked him for his religious beliefs.

The pair knew of each other from the previous three times Mirdjaja had been ordered to serve time but had never spoken.

It was not until Mirdjaja personally witnessed Chan's devotion to God that he started to believe in Christianity

In 2011, the Indonesian - who is now 40 years old - was imprisoned for robbery.

'[The first time we spoke] we had a debate about philosophy and Christianity,' Mirdjaja told Daily Mail Australia.

'At that time, I mocked him because I said that "The Christian foundation is a really silly thing to believe. How do you as a Christian believe in someone who died on the cross and couldn't save his own ass and you expect him to save your ass?"'

Mirdjaja said Chan did not get offended by this exchange and just smiled at him. After the first conversation, they continued their debates about religion, philosophy and history, which the Australian 'knows a lot about'.

'One day he came to me and said "You can't fit God in your brain man, no matter how big your brain is, you cannot fit God in your brain because God is in your heart, so you have to fit God in your heart",' Mirdjaja said.

'He said that to me... at that time I had addiction to drugs inside prison still [to heroin].

'During that period, he gave me a Bible but I just threw it away and again Andrew never got offended.'

The group was one of many programs Chan and his fellow Bali Nine inmate, Myuran Sukuraman, pioneered to help rehabilitate 'hundreds' of prisoners

It was not until Mirdjaja personally witnessed Chan's devotion to God that he started to believe in Christianity.

'A spiritual encounter happened during that period [when Mirdjaja was still addicted to drugs], one of them was when Andrew helped me get through my addiction so he laid down and prayed on me and then he did it constantly,' Mirdjaja said.

'Andrew didn't intend to ask me to stop drugs at that time but how he approached me was helping [me to be] free from my addiction.

'I had my addiction for 20 years and that's when I stopped and I realised that he taught me a lot about Christianity. I made the decision to be baptised in prison, so Andrew baptised me.'

After Mirdjaja was baptised, he and Chan started up a Bible study group inside Kerobokan prison.

According to the Indonesian, this is one of many programs Chan and his fellow Bali Nine inmate, Myuran Sukuraman, have pioneered to help rehabilitate 'hundreds' of prisoners.

Mirdjaja left prison in 2013 and has now started to preach at churches in south-east Asia, while trying to roll out rehabilitation programs started by the Australians to help others at 17 different prisons around Indonesia.

Mirdjaja visits Chan five times a week when he's in Bali. 

As part of his role as an evangelist, Mirdjaja visits Nusa Kambangan - also known as Death Island - where Chan and Sukuraman are expected to meet their fate and says the prisons are surrounded by jungle with 19 tigers prowling the grounds. 

Just hours before Mirdjaja spoke with Daily Mail Australia, news emerged the executions of Chan and Sukumaran, who were meant to moved to Nusa Kambangan this week to be shot dead, were postponed.

The former inmate is very vocal about how he feels about the death penalty in Indonesia.

'The maximum sentence is actually written in our system to give impact so people can change themselves, so people can rehabilitate themselves,' Mirdjaja said.

'Now we have two living monuments [Chan and Sukuraman] who can make a testimony of how people can change themselves inside prison but then the government is going to shoot them anyway.'

Mirdjaja also pointed to a piece of draft legislation that would see those sentenced to death have their penalty reduced if they showed 10 years of good behaviour.

'Why don't we wait for that to become the law. We're not running out of time to give life,' he said.

'It's unfair, not only about them, but for everyone. The government should really open dialogue [about the death penalty] to give people a chance to live.'

Mirdjaja said he had witnessed Chan and Sukuraman change people's lives in prison and they deserved to be spared.

'These guys have love and compassion and a genuine heart. My life before I had seen so many lies, I've seen all the people speak the other way around with their behaviour,' he said.

'They do a good thing in their right hand but bad thing in their left hand. [Chan and Sukuraman's] message is simple - love and compassion. They never judge other people.'

When asked how the pair are dealing with their impending deaths, Mirdjaja said they were 'not even sad' about it.

'They really surrender everything to the Lord, whatever happens, happens,' he said.

'[Andrew] never said there's nothing we can do but he knew everything has a reason for the Lord and how we respond [to it is up to us].

'These boys responded very well, they give love and compassion. Why don't we give a chance for them?

'Andrew jokes about [his last rites]. He says I have the right to live in Bali. We never talk about how are you preparing for death.

'The boys they're strong. If it was us, we'd get very emotional like me and the family, I'm very emotional. I say this is an injustice and it's unfair.'
