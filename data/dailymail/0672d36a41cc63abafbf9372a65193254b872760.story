Arsenal have opened talks with Porto over a deal for Colombia midfielder Juan Quintero.

Such a move would place further question marks over the future of Atletico Madrid target Santi Cazorla but reports out of South America on Thursday night said a fee has been agreed for £15.8m and that Quintero was on a flight to London Heathrow.

The 21-year-old's agent Maria Elena Chavarro tweeted on Thursday: 'Today @juanferquinte10 travelled to England to sign a contract with Arsenal who are paying 20m Euros (around £15.8m) to FCPorto, congratulations!'

Doubts: The move increases speculation of Santi Cazorla's potential departure from the club

Quintero took a flight From Medellin to Bogota before flying to Heathrow with a ticket for seat 6A according to Colombian reports.

He was in Jose Pekerman's World Cup squad that reached the quarter-finals in Brazil.

The youngster came off the bench in their second group game against Ivory Coast, scoring the goal that put Colombia 2-0 up, and started their 4-1 win over Japan in their final group game.

And then appeared as a sub again with 10 minutes to go in their last-eight match as they lost against the host nation.

Rio Ferdinand was one of those to praise Quintero last year, saying: ‘I watched the Under 20 World Cup and there was a kid called (Juan) Quintero playing for Colombia.

‘The way he receives the ball, you don’t really see young players in our country doing that.'

However, another of Quintero's representatives, Ricardo Calleri, claims the 21-year-old will not leave Porto unless his buy-out is triggered, though he says his client has a number of suitors throughout Europe.

'Porto have never talked about negotiating the sale of Juan Quintero,' Calleri told MaisFutebol.

'Of course, there are clubs interested. There is a lot of interest from clubs from Spain and England in the player.

'But in order for him to leave, a club has to pay his buy-out clause.'
