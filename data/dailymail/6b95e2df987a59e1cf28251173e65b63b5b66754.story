Surfers are making the most of the weather by riding massive 65ft waves off the French coast following the recent storms. 

The Belharra giant waves are only surfed by experts who are towed out by a water scooter to catch the surf. 

Thanks to certain climatic conditions in autumn and winter, a strong swell hits the Belharra Perdun underwater spur enabling a 30ft to 65ft wave to form.

Monster wave: A man surfs the Belharra giant waves off the French coast which reach up to 20 metres high thanks to weather conditions

Among those who have made the trip is Shane Dorian, 41, who has travelled from Hawaii and caught just two of the 20-metre waves today.  

The waves today moved at 25mph. He told the Guardian: I was pretty nervous because there was some heat behind the swell. I had some butterflies in my stomach.'

Europe is not normally associated with big waves but this monster is up there with some of the biggest waves in the world. 

Belharra is situated a mile and a half offshore from Saint Jean De Luz in the heart of the French basque region.

A couple of surfers rode the Belharra in 2003 at 60ft, but even to this day no one really knows what size it will hold.

Epic: Thanks to certain climatic conditions in autumn and winter, a strong swell hits the Belharra Perdun underwater spur enabling a 10 to 20 metre wave to form

The wave only breaks on rare occasions marching in along a deep ocean trench and unloading open ocean power with waves reaching epic proportions.
