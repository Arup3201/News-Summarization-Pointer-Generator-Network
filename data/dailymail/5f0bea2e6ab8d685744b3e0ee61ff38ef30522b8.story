It had to be him. As the clock ticked towards its 92nd minute and with no discernible reason to suggest that Arsenal would come away with anything more than a point against a staunch Crystal Palace, up popped Aaron Ramsey.

Right place, right time. Slammed past Julian Speroni and there would be no first day slip-ups that have become the norm for Arsene Wenger. Arsenal won on the opening day for the first time since 2009 and had their fulcrum to thank.

There is an argument that the last-gasp winner could have fallen to anyone, but it was no mistake that Ramsey took up a clever station, alone at the back post, to plunder home. It’s the seventh game in under a year that goals from the Welshman have won the Gunners a game. From central midfield, that’s some record.

At it again: Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey scored the winner in added time against Crystal Palace on Saturday

Right place, right time: The Welsh midfielder has made a habit of popping up when the Gunners need him most

Team player: Ramsey's team-mates pile on top of him after the 2-1 win in Arsenal's Premier League opener

Aug 16: vs Crystal Palace (2-1)

May 17: vs Hull City (3-2)

Nov 6: vs Dortmund (1-0)

Sept 28: vs Swansea (2-1)

Sept 18: vs Marseille (2-1)

Sept 14: vs Sunderland (two goals in 3-1 win)

Aug 27: vs Fenerbahce (two goals in 2-0 win)

That is now five in his last six appearances, and there doesn’t appear to be any stopping the 23-year-old.

Make no mistake, this was not vintage Ramsey. He - much like the rest of Arsenal’s midfield - was guilty of giving the ball away needlessly against Palace and actually struggled to impose himself on the game, saying as much afterwards.

But what sets him apart, even when he’s not at the races, is that prowess in front of goal. Sixteen last year - even after four months out injured - along with two already this. There is even a tinge of Frank Lampard about the way in which he comes alive on the edge coupled with that drive to go and join in with the lone front man.

The common conception is that if Ramsey stays fit, Arsenal may just upset those at the Etihad and Stamford Bridge come May. And it’s difficult to argue.

Here is a man who can drag this side through games, take control of the tightest of battles and is the club’s heartbeat. His stock continues to rise after each 90 minutes. In the current financial climate, the figures Arsenal could demand are astronomical. How much is he now worth? £40million, Alan Shearer mused on Saturday night? Potentially more.

No stopping him: He also popped up with the winner against Dortmund in the Champions League last year

Hunt for silverware: Ramsey lead the Gunners to the FA Cup, can he do the same with the Premier League

There is no chance he’ll be leaving the Emirates any time soon, though. This has been the first summer for a long time whereby Wenger hasn’t lost top players - the ailing Thomas Vermaelen and Bacary Sagna aren’t in the same league as others who previously departed - and there isn’t that pressure to cash in any longer.

Ramsey has proven he is the player to build a new team around, and that’s what the manager has begun to do. Signing Mesut Ozil last year and Alexis Sanchez this shows the type of intent that has been severely lacking over the last decade. But what’s more, from Ramsey’s point of view at least, he now has colleagues of a similar classy ilk. While the Chilean was another to disappoint on home debut, it’s plain to see that his movement off the ball is something the chief playmaker will relish.

And Arsenal will need Ramsey’s invention mixed with runners in between the lines if they are to win enough games to launch a title charge, Palace - actually buoyed by the bizarre circumstances to have engulfed the club’s Premier League preparations over the last few days - demonstrated that they are a tricky customer to break down; the hosts offered very little, but still found a way of picking up three points.

Shut out: Alexis Sanchez struggled to make an impact for Arsenal on his Premier League debut

Star: Meanwhile, Ramsey is one of Europe's premier midfielders who can galvanise the Gunners

There had been hallmarks of the dithering performance against Aston Villa on this weekend last year, when they were beaten to a chorus of boos. Not this time. Ramsey and co found a way, just, and it’s something they will have to keep up. Last season’s draws against Swansea, West Brom and Everton must be converted, defeat at Stoke reversed.

Wenger is close to assembling a squad ready to win this division again, and in Ramsey has one of Europe’s premier midfielders to galvanise a group in need of a leader.
