Southern Britain is set to be battered by flash flooding this Friday two days before the remnants of Hurricane Bertha make landfall across the Atlantic.

A yellow ‘be aware’ rain warning is in place for the South East on Friday due to an unconnected weather front moving in from the English Channel.

It comes after residents in the North East had to battle with heavy downpours and flooding today in the first glimpse of a wave of wet weather.

Commuters in Newcastle were seen driving through deep flooding as up to 1in (25mm) of rain fell in just three hours, causing flash flooding in some parts.

But the heavy rain is expected to clear to make way for sunshine later today and tomorrow.

Commuters in Newcastle woke up to flooded roads this morning after heavy rain and thundery showers poured down across the north of England through the night

The flooding is the first glimpse of the wet weather which is expected to hit the UK this weekend, as the tail end of an Atlantic storm moves across to Europe

Emergency services had to attend to several minor road collisions and 
were called to help residents who could not deal with this morning's 
flooding

In just three hours, there was 11m of rainfall recorded in Durham and 11.4mm in parts of Cumbria, as heavy rainfall hit across northern and eastern areas

The tail-end of Bertha is then 
expected to hit by Sunday, after it has been battering the Caribbean 
islands with gusts of more than 90mph.

As
 it moves across the Atlantic tomorrow, it is expected to 'intensify 
rapidly' but will slow down and 'weaken' again as it moves further east.

Although
 it has now been downgraded to an ‘extra tropical storm,’ Bertha is 
predicted to bring two days of heavy rain for the South.

Met
 Office deputy chief meteorologist Chris Tubbs said: ‘There is a 70 per 
cent chance it will hit the South and 30 per cent in the North.

‘I don't think winds will be an issue but because this was a tropical storm at origin, there could be very heavy rain.

‘The areas particularly vulnerable are along the south coast, across the London area and East Anglia.

The three-day forecast shows a mix of rain, sunshine and scattered 
showers across most parts of the UK, with heavy rain due, particularly 
in the south, on Friday

Pedestrians shelter under their umbrellas from the rain on Newcastle Quayside. Many streets in the city were left with surface water flooding after rainfall last night

The Met Office said most of the country would see sunshine and dry 
weather on Thursday, before rain starts to hit London, The Midlands and 
the south and south east on England on Friday

The Met Office said there was not an 'unusual amount' of rain for this 
time of year but that, because it fell in a short period of time, it led
 to flash flooding in parts of the country, including here in Newcastle

There is expected to be more 'persistent' rain in 
the north of the country on Friday, while a wet weather warning could be
 put in place for southern parts of the country

Punts in Oxford, which are in demand by tourists
 over the summer holidays, were left waterlogged this morning after a 
night of heavy rain

‘There
 will be heavy rain of up to 50mm (2in) in that period.  If it falls in 
between six and 12 hours there is a potential for floods.’

The
 Met Office’s yellow warning on Friday was issued in Cambridgeshire, 
East Sussex, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, London, Norfolk and Suffolk.

It
 alerted the public to ‘heavy, possibly thundery rain’ and a ‘risk of 
disruption to travel due to standing surface water on some roads’.

Bertha
 is currently off the eastern seaboard of the US and is expected to move
 across the Atlantic, with the remnants reaching Europe at the 
weekend.

But the Met Office 
said its forecasts and those of other meteorological organisations show 
the UK should miss any serious impacts’ from its tail end.

The wet weather has already arrived in some parts of the country.

Last
 night in Carlisle, there was 0.97in (24.6mm) of rain recorded in six 
hours, while parts of Cumbria saw more than 0.43in (11mm) fall in three 
hours.

Surfers in the water at Fistral Beach, Newquay, enjoyed the warm weather which spread across the south west today, after heavy rain in the area yesterday

After heavy rain on Tuesday, sunshine spread across the south west, including Cornwall. The sunshine 
is expected to stay in the area until Friday, when rain is forecast

Forecasters said most areas would enjoy dry weather on Wednesday and 
Thursday, with some sunshine and the odd heavy shower. Pictured: A dog basks in the

This storm tracker shows Bertha moving across the Atlantic on Wednesday 
and Thursday, before heading east towards the UK on Friday

This shows Bertha, shown in red, which has been downgraded from a 
hurricane to a storm. The Met Office said it will lose momentum as it 
leaves the warm seas and now has a 30 per cent chance of hitting the UK

This shows the direction of Bertha, which will cause a 'summer storm', consisting of blustery winds and rain, if it reaches the UK on Sunday evening

People flocked to Brighton beach yesterday afternoon to make the most of
 the final rays of sunshine before a weekend of predicted wet weather

In Walkergate, 
Newcastle, a number of commuters found themselves stuck in knee-high 
rain water as they attempted to drive to work.

Although
 the Met Office said these measurements were 'not unheard of' at this 
time of year, the sudden downpours did cause flash flooding.

A spokesman said: 'The North East have experienced very heavy rain over the past 24 hours.

‘There were heavy showers in a short amount of time this morning which would have been what caused the flooding.

'The
 rain is due to ease off and tomorrow will be a much brighter picture. 
It is going to be a dry night with clear spells and a fresh feeling.'

Meanwhile, the heavy rain seen across eastern and northern parts of the country was expected to gradually clear today.

In
 other parts of the country, people will be able to enjoy mostly dry 
weather today and tomorrow, with some sunshine and the odd heavy shower.
