A Missouri rancher has now found three of her cows mutilated in bizarre and unusual ways and after ruling out every explanation under the sun, she's prepared to look further into the heavens toward a culprit more outlandish: aliens.

Lyn Mitchell of Henry County, Missouri says the first example occurred back in 2011. That cow had its tongue completely excised, along with one of its ears.

She assumed teenagers were to blame. But after she found two more cows with mutilated genitals and missing organs on her farm just this summer, she now believes something harder to explain could be to blame and local police agree with her.

Alien carnivores? Henry County, Missouri farmer Lyn Mitchell has now seen three of her cows bizarrely mutilated and is ready to believe aliens could be to blame

On July 9, Mitchell found one of her best cows dead in her field. She first noticed its tongue was missing, which was appalling enough.

But she then realized the cow’s udders, anus, reproductive organs, and ears had all been removed.

About two weeks later, it happened again. Though she hadn’t called a veterinarian to inspect the first two cows, she did get one in to see the third.

Whodunnit? All three cows were female and had their tongues completely removed

‘I’m normally a very private person,’ Mitchell told KSHB. ‘But I’m willing to do this because it’s just something I want some answers to.’

The vet’s findings only served to disturb Mitchell even more.

Though he was unable to determine a cause of death, the vet told Mitchell that the cuts were extremely precise, almost surgically so.

Grotesque: Pictured is the third mutilated cow. Its heart had been removed and left to hang outside its body

Mysterious: Beneath one of the cows was a mysterious char mark in a perfect outline of the mutilated animal

What’s more, despite the grievous injuries to the cows, no blood was found.

Underneath the third cow, there was a mysteriously charred outline of the cow itself. It’s heart had also been cut from its body but left to hang outside the cow.

‘We couldn’t see any signs of trauma, and it doesn’t appear that there was any type of wild animal, such coyotes, that were involved,’ Robert Hills, Henry County Sheriff’s Chief Deputy, told KMOX.

Faced with having found three of her cows, all female, all with their tongues removed, and two with missing reproductive organs dead on her farm, Mitchell is now searching for answers.

Precision: The incisions used to cut the cows were surgically precise and did not bleed

Utterly disgusting: The two cows killed this July were found with mutilated genitals and missing udders

‘The more it happens, the more questions you get. And the more you learn, you find more and more things that make you ask more questions,’ Mitchell said.

Mitchell said some of those questions might have her looking toward the sky.

‘Something happened to these cows and it's not something that you see every day, it's not in your normal, so something else is going on,’ she said.

And the local sheriff’s office isn’t ruling aliens out, either.

‘We’re having to look at this from two sides,’ said Hills. ‘Some people believe that there are aliens that are involved in this or the possibility of the occult going to the other end of the spectrum.’=

Open-minded: Mitchell says all the normal explanations have been debunked and is ready to believe aliens could be to blame. 'The more it happens, the more questions you get,' she said
