The hacker-activist group Anonymous says it hijacked the website of the U.S. Sentencing Commission to avenge the death of Aaron Swartz, an Internet activist who committed suicide on January 11.

The website of the commission, an independent agency of the judicial branch, was taken over early Saturday.

Hackers replaced the homescreen with a message warning that when Swartz killed himself two weeks ago 'a line was crossed.'

Hacked: This screenshot shows the hijacking of the sentencing commission website by Anonymous. The group claim they have already infiltrated several other government sites

Anonymous say they've infiltrated several government computer systems and copied secret information that they now threaten to make public.

The message on the sentencing website partly read:

'Citizens of the world, Anonymous has observed for some time now the trajectory of justice in the United States with growing concern.

'We have marked the departure of this system from the noble ideals in which it was born and enshrined.

'We have seen the erosion of due process, the dilution of constitutional rights, the usurpation of the rightful authority of courts by the "discretion" or prosecutors.

This is the moment Swartz was caught illegally downloading academic journals. The 26-year-old killed himself on January 11 after his friends and family say he was bullied by prosecutors

Swartz was a gifted programmer and campaigner who helped to create Reddit and CSS

'We have seen how the law is wielded less and less to uphold justice, and more and more to exercise control, authority and power in the interests of oppression or personal gain.'

Family and friends of Swartz, who helped create Reddit and RSS, say he killed himself after he was hounded by federal prosecutors.

Officials say he helped post millions of court documents for free online and that he illegally downloaded millions of academic articles from an online clearinghouse.
