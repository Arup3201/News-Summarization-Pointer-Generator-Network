Cornelio Rodriguez-Gonzalez told police he knelt on his seven-month-old son's chest before the boy died

A 23-year-old Las Vegas father told police he knelt on his seven-month-old son's chest before the boy died last week because he was angry the baby was being 'fussy' even after being fed.

Cornelio Rodriguez-Gonzalez was being held Monday at the Clark County jail pending a court appearance on a murder by child abuse charge in the death of his son, Raymond.

The 255-pound Rodriguez-Gonzalez was arrested November 18 after initially telling the boy's mother, Amy Elliott, that the child had fallen while she was at work.

A police report says authorities found bruises on the child's face and hip, scrapes on the back of his head, partially healed rib injuries and a lacerated liver was that was believed to have led to his death.

Rodriguez-Gonzalez was watching Raymond and his two stepsons on the day of the incident while their mother was at work, reports Review Journal.

On her lunch break, Elliot called Rodriguez-Gonzalez and the pair argued about care of Raymond.

While still talking to Elliott, Rodriguez-Gonzalez went to check on the baby, only to find that Raymond was not breathing.

Elliot told Rodriguez-Gonzalez to call 911 - the baby was taken to University Medical Center.

Rodriguez-Gonzalez said he would take the other children to a friend’s house and meet her at the hospital, but he disappeared.

Raymond died at the hospital from his devastating injuries. 

Two days later, Rodriguez-Gonzalez turned himself in to police and confessed to kneeling on Raymond, according to the report.
