A couple were killed when their light aircraft crashed into an airport runway as they returned from a shopping break in Paris.

Pilot Gary Vickers, 58, and his girlfriend Kay Clarke, 42, were on their way back from the French capital when their twin-engine plane smashed into the ground as they tried to land.

Businessman Mr Vickers – whose father Gordon is a close friend of former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott – flew the light aircraft to the UK from his property in Andorra early last week.

The father of two then took the Eurostar to London where he met up with Miss Clarke, his partner of six years.

The ‘devoted couple’ went on a short break to Amsterdam before returning to the UK and flying out to Paris for a shopping trip.

They
had been planning to make the return flight on Thursday, but Miss 
Clarke phoned her parents to say they were delayed by stormy weather.

The
pair, who met while Miss Clarke was dining at Mr Vickers’ family hotel 
in Cheshire, eventually decided to embark on what would be their final 
journey on Friday morning.

Tragic: The wreckage of the aircraft is recovered from the crash site at Hawarden Airport near Broughton

Found: Mr Vickers died instantly in the crash next to the Airbus factory and Ms Clarke died later in hospital

Mr Vickers died instantly in the accident that afternoon. Miss Clarke survived the impact but died hours later in hospital.

Her
devastated mother Angela, 66, said: ‘They idolised each other and Gary 
would never have put Kay’s life in danger. Gary was a gentleman.

‘My husband has been up with him in his plane, and his flying skills were spot on.

‘They
were absolutely devoted to each other. They went to pop festivals 
together and because he was older than her he used to joke “She’s 
dragging  me there again”. But they really enjoyed the events together.’

Mrs Clarke and her 
husband William, 70, started to worry when they had not received a phone
call from their daughter to say she had landed safely.

‘When Kay didn’t ring me at 1pm on Friday I started panicking. She was due at the doctor’s at 3pm,’ said Mrs Clarke.

Police were called to the scene at Hawarden Airport at about 1.10pm, where the wreckage was found

Flying home: Friends of Mr Vickers and Ms Clarke said they were returning from Paris when the plane crashed

‘We were devastated when we heard a flight had crashed on the radio.’

The
couple, who lived in Chester, regularly went on exotic holidays 
together, including trips to Mexico and Egypt. They also owned property 
in Gibraltar.

The 
accident occurred after one of their many trips to Paris. Their light 
aircraft crashed on a runway at Hawarden Airport in Flintshire, North 
Wales, at around 1pm on Friday.

A
plane spotter caught the aircraft on camera coming in to land and 
flipping in the air before dramatically plummeting into the airfield.

The
photographs showed the small white twin engine plane banking before 
nose diving into the ground and smashing into pieces on impact.

Firefighters
from the nearby UK Airbus wing factory were first on the scene at the 
runway, which serves business and private flights.

Mr
Vickers was pronounced dead at the crash scene and Miss Clarke was 
taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital where she later died of her 
injuries.

Mr
Vickers’ father Gordon said: ‘All the family are devastated. Gary was 
an excellent pilot, both single and twin aircraft, with hundreds of 
hours in his log book.’

The
successful businessman, who ran the Mill Hotel and Spa in Chester with 
his son, added: ‘Flying was his passion. I do not think it was pilot 
error – more of an engine failure. But we will have to wait and see.’

Mr
Vickers, a fan of extreme sports including mountain biking, 
wakeboarding and skiing, had recently renewed his helicopter pilots’ 
licence.

Labour veteran 
Lord Prescott, who often spends New Year’s Eve with his wife Pauline at 
the Vickers’ family hotel, paid tribute to his friend’s son.

He
said: ‘This is so desperately tragic. Gary lived for flying and helping
others. Pauline and I express our deepest condolences to Gordon and his
family and hope they’ll be allowed to grieve in private.’

The Air Accident Investigation Branch said a final report into the incident could take months to issue.

Aviation consultant Chris Yates said: ‘Nothing should have gone wrong in that final landing phase.

The pilot in question was very skilled in fixed wing flying and also in rotary flying.

‘So
probably the air accident investigators will focus more on the 
maintenance of the aircraft and whether any mechanical failure 
happened.’

Airport owner Aviation Park Group Ltd said it could not comment on the crash.

A North Wales Police spokesman said: ‘We are working with the AAIB to establish what caused the plane to crash.’

Mr Vickers had previously been married to Francine, 54, and they had two children together – 24-year-old James and Rebecca, 22.
