This is the shocking moment an 18-year-old girl apparently fell out of a moving car while twerking on the vehicle's passenger side with the door wide open in Georgia. 

Brittany Symone was caught on video performing the dance move - made famous by singer Miley Cyrus - to the tune of K Camp's 'Lil Bit' as she traveled through Atlanta with her sister and friend. 

Adopting a squatting stance on the car's passenger side, she jiggled her bottom and waved her arms around to the rap music. But seconds later, she seemingly overbalanced.

Friends: Brittany's  twerking was captured on video by her friend (right) last week. The friend later posted the footage on her Instagram page, where she uses the handle 'futuremodel_'. Left, Brittany in a personal photo

Footage shows the teenager reaching for the open door's handle in an apparent last-ditch attempt to remain inside the moving vehicle, before losing her grip and plummeting toward the ground.

Although Brittany seemingly lands on her feet, the car's speed means she almost immediately topples over to the left. She is filmed crashing sideways on to the road, her arms flying wildly through the air.

The 'twerk-induced' incident, believed to have occurred last week, was captured on video by Brittany's friend and later posted on her Instagram page, with the caption: 'Good thing I caught it on camera.'

The footage quickly went viral, with many social media users condemning the teenager for her 'stupidity'. One wrote: 'I hopes shes OK but I count even hold in the laughter (sic).'

However, some highlighted the possibility that it was staged. Indeed, several users claimed that Brittany appeared to deliberately jump out of the car, not fall.

Regardless, in the amateur video, played more than 6.5million times, the car does seem to be moving (albeit, slowly) - making the teenager's plunge from the vehicle  undoubtedly painful.

Although some reports suggested that Brittany suffered a severe neck and spine injury in the fall - and may possibly even be in a coma - her friend has since dismissed the claims.

'Stupid': After the video was posted online, it quickly went viral, with many social media users condemning the teenager for her 'stupidity'. One wrote: 'I hopes shes OK but I count even hold in the laughter (sic).'

In a video posted on Vine, the unnamed friend, who uses the handle 'CatFish', said: 'She's good. She's just a little ashy. That's it.'

Twerking shot into the spotlight last year following Cyrus's provocative dancing at the MTV VMAs.

Since then, dozens of stars, satirists and exhibitionists have jumped on the twerking bandwagon.
