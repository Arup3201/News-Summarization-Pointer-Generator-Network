After his latest Club World Cup success, Cristiano Ronaldo has now won the same eight trophies with two different teams.

The Real Madrid star, who seems to break records as a matter of routine, became the first player to achieve the feat.

Ronaldo has won the league, domestic cup, Community Shield, Player of the Year Award, Golden Boot, Ballon d'Or, Champions League and Club World Cup with both Real Madrid and Manchester United.

But Ronaldo wasn't the only person to reach new heights in the victory over San Lorenzo.

Real manager Carlo Ancelotti equalled the record for the most European and international club competitions won by a manager. 

The former AC Milan and Chelsea boss has now won three Champions League titles, three European Super Cups and two Club World Cups.

Ancelotti joined Bayern Munich's Pep Guardiola and legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson at the top of the list.
