Shamed 'crystal methodist' Paul Flowers has reportedly installed gates around his vicarage to discourage couples from parking up to have sex there

Shamed 'crystal methodist' Paul Flowers has reportedly installed gates around his vicarage to discourage couples from parking up to have sex there.

The disgraced former Co-Op bank chief lives for free in a church owned four-bedroom house near Bradford’s Brackenhill Park.

Visitors to the area will often park at the end of his drive.

But Flowers has now reportedly installed metal gates outside his home after it has become a popular dogging spot for couples, with up to three cars regularly pulling up outside his home.

Flowers, 63, is currently suspended from his post as a vicar after it emerged that he allegedly took drugs and paid for sex with male escorts.

Neighbours told the Daily Star Sunday that the cleric had repeatedly asked the couples to move, but that they kept coming back.

They said: 'He got fed-up of asking them to move. So in the end he got the gates and that solved the problem.

'Paul only closes them at night and he’s happy for the drive to be used during the day by people visiting the park.'

It comes after the Methodist - who is currently suspended while he is being investigated - publicly admitted he was appointed to the chair of the Co-op Bank only because he had ‘friends in high places’.

The shamed banker’s admission was just one of a number of astonishing remarks he has made in a Twitter account opened last week.

The statement came only days after Clive Adamson, the director of supervision at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), shocked MPs by defending his appointment of  Rev Flowers – who nearly destroyed the Co-op Bank.

Under a profile, believed to have been set up by Flowers, the Methodist minister apparently tweeted: ‘How do the FCA not concede that they were wrong to approve my appointment? I only got the position because I had friend’s [sic] in high places.’

Before Flowers’s spectacular fall from grace last November – when he was caught on camera paying for cocaine and crystal meth – he had been an important figure in the Co-op movement and the Labour Party.

Labour leader Ed Miliband had been drawn into the affair as he had held a private meeting with Flowers in March 2013, a month before his bank lent Labour £1.2 million.

Flowers and Mr Miliband had two other informal dinners and three other meetings. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls’s office was also given a £50,000 donation from the Co-op Group, but Mr Balls insisted he had had no direct contact with Flowers.

The banker's bail for alleged drugs supply offences was extended last Tuesday until April

A spokeswoman for the Methodist Church, still providing Flowers with a salary and a home despite suspending him from his pastoral duties, said: ‘We cannot comment because we cannot be sure whether the account is genuine.

‘The position remains that he is suspended and we will hold our disciplinary process once the criminal process is complete.’

On Friday morning, Flowers claimed to have been taken to hospital overnight with, ‘a suspected heart attack & high blood pressure’ although by 8.36am he was, apparently, back at his Bradford home tweeting about it.

When not planning his future or house-hunting, the subject of his first tweet last Sunday evening, his tweets have taken the form of ‘inspirational quotes’.

On Wednesday it was Dolly Parton with: ‘If you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain’.

And on Friday it was US Second World War general George Patton: ‘I don’t measure a man’s success by how high he climbs, but how high he bounces when he hits bottom.’
