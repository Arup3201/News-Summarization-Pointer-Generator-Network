The former leader of a 'gay cure,' faith-based group has married his male partner.

John Smid, former executive director of 'Love in Action' -- the group that said it could stop people from being attracted to the same sex -- tied the knot with his same-sex partner Larry McQueen on Nov. 16 in Hugo, OK, according to LGBTQ Nation. 

Smid left the Memphis founded group 'Love in Action' -- now called 'Restoration Path' -- in 2008 and came out as gay in 2011, the same year he divorced his second wife. Smid has been with McQueen for one year.

Acquaintances: Smid said that he and McQueen began as acquaintances but gradually got to know each other and soon began to pursue a dating relationship

Smid renounced his message that gays could be 'cured' saying 'One cannot repent of something that is unchangeable,' LGBTQ reports. 

'I’ve believed in faith that something was going to happen, and it never did,' Smid told the Lone Star Q in March, 'and so at my age, right now in my life, I don’t have that many good years left in me, and I can’t live like this for the rest of my life, so I said no I’m not willing to keep pushing after something that’s not going to happen.' 

Smid spent years  in the 'gay cure' business as an 'ex-gay' leader, but in a Facebook post announcing his marriage to McQueen, Smid wrote that his relationship with McQueen is a mirror he sees in to each day, according to Gay Star News.

'For most of my life, the mirror I saw reflected my mistakes, shortcomings and failures,' Smid wrote.

Action: Smid served as executive director of 'gay cure' group 'Love in Action' from 1990 to 2008 we he promoted 'Pray the Gay Away' sermons

'The reflection I see today with Larry shows me the positive things in my life, my strengths, gifts and talents. I see how I can succeed at a mutual intimate and loving relationship. For this, I am truly grateful.'

Smid also wrote that he and McQueen began as acquaintances and gradually got to know each other over time and then wanted to pursue a dating relationship.

‘As we dated we shared our vision for life, our personal philosophies, and our faith values. We found a compatibility that was comfortable and exciting,' Smid wrote.

Smid served as executive director of 'Love in Action' from 1990 to 2008 but said he had been trying to deny his unchangeable sexuality, according to Metro. 

Criticism: 'Love in Action' drew criticism in 2005when it promoted a program promoting its claims of being able to change the sexuality of children. The group was the subject of a 2011 documentary called 'This is What Love in Action Looks Like'

After leaving 'Love in Action' Smid found Grace Rivers, a fellowship for gay Christians.

Gay Star reports that Smid has repeatedly apologized for his involvement in the ex-gay movement and has reached out to those who have been put through the 'gay cure' programs.

'Love in Action' drew criticism in 2005, according to Metro, when it promoted a program promoting its claims of being able to change the sexuality of children.
