The pressure of the World Cup coming to its final stretch doesn't seem to be getting to the Argentinian players as they took part in a spot of tennis football during training.

Their World Cup semi-final showdown with Holland will go a long way to determining whether Lionel Messi is to gain hero status like Diego Maradona.

But it isn't all work and no play in Alejandro Sabella's camp, as they made time to fit in a bit of fun over the net days after Wimbledon came to an end at SW19.

Cagey: Argentina will look to get past Holland in the World Cup semi-final and set up a potential Brazil final

6 - James Rodriguez (Colombia)

4 - Thomas Muller (Germany), Lionel Messi (Argentina), Neymar (Brazil)

3 - Karim Benzema (France), Arjen Robben (Holland), Enner Valencia (Ecuador), Robin van Persie (Holland), Xherdan Shaqiri (Switzerland)

Those in italic are out of the World Cup through injury or elimination.

As if Messi needed any more motivation, the Barcelona maestro could become the tournament's top goalscorer with a hat-trick against the Dutch.

The 27-year-old, though, has competition from Germany's Thomas Muller, who faces Brazil on Tuesday.

The current top goalscorer - Colombia's James Rodriguez - was knocked out by the host nation.

The potential for a Brazil vs Argentina World Cup final is tempting, but Messi and Co must orchestrate a win over Louis van Gaal's confident Holland team first.

Holland saw off Costa Rica on penalties in the quarter-finals - a shoot-out which told the world a lot about Van Gaal's tactical genius.

The new Manchester United manager hauled off first-choice goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen for the penalties alone, bringing on Newcastle United's Tim Krul, who became an instant hero by saving two spot-kicks.
