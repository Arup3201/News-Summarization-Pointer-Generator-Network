President Barack Obama took a brief break from his vacation in Martha's Vineyard today to announce the imminent end to the Gaddafi regime in Libya.

As critics continued to call for the President to come home from his exclusive holiday, he issued his second statement on the precarious state of the Middle East in 24 hours.

'This much is clear,' he declared. The Gaddafi regime is coming to an end and the future of Libya is in the hands of the people.'

Mr Obama repeated his call for 
Colonel Gaddafi to accept reality and relinquish power, saying the 
tyrant had threatened to 'hunt protesters down like rats' but the 
uprising had shown 'human dignity' was far stronger than a dictator.

Following a day of dramatic 
developments in Libya, Mr Obama issued a statement last night, saying 
the country had reached a 'tipping point' and that control of the 
capital was 'slipping from the grasp of a tyrant.'

Should Obama cancel his vacation to deal with the Libya crisis?

'The surest way for the bloodshed to end is simple: Muammar Gaddafi and his regime need to recognise that their rule has come to an end.

'Gaddafi needs to acknowledge the reality that he no longer controls Libya. He needs to relinquish power once and for all.'

Mr Obama issued the statement after 
conducting a conference call with members of his national security team,
who had kept him updated throughout the day.

The president had told reporters 
earlier that he would not make a statement 'until we have full 
confirmation of what has happened.'

Libyan rebels who raced into Tripoli 
on Sunday met little resistance as Gaddafi's defenders melted away and 
his 42-year rule rapidly crumbled.

Euphoric fighters celebrated with residents in Green Square, the symbolic heart of the fading regime.

Gaddafi's whereabouts were unknown, 
though state TV broadcast his bitter pleas for Libyans to defend his 
regime.

A vacationing President Barack Obama has been kept up to date by 
aides on developments in Libya and U.S. 
officials were in touch with their contacts there to check on the 
progress of rebel troops advancing on Libya's capital, Tripoli.

A senior administration official said the president was briefed throughout Saturday and Sunday at Martha's 
Vineyard and would continue to get regular updates, through the night if
necessary.

A second senior official said the 
administration was in close contact with the Libyan opposition and U.S. 
allies and partners, and believes that Gaddafi's days in power 
are numbered.

The administration will also continue to stress that this is a matter for the Libyan people to decide.The officials, both with the White House and with other agencies, spoke anonymously to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters.

Reporters in Tripoli heard gunfire and explosions after rebel troops seized control of Zawiya, a major coastal city not far from the capital.

Rebel leaders called it the start of an attack on Gaddafi's main stronghold.

Mr Obama spent most of Saturday at his vacation compound on the island off Cape Cod.

He dropped in briefly at a reception hosted by his friend and former law school professor, Charles Ogletree, but was back at the complex in just over an hour.

Mr Obama teed off his vacation with a round of golf at the  Vineyard Golf Club in Edgartown.

Aides said the President played the links course with long-time Chicago friend Eric Whitaker and two White 
House staffers.

Book smarts: U.S. President Barack Obama dresses casually as he walks out of the Bunch of Grapes book store with his daughters Malia (right) and Sasha (centre) on his first day in Martha's Vineyard

Earlier in the day Mr
Obama visited the Bunch of Grapes book shop in Vineyard Haven with 
daughters Malia, 13, and Sasha, 10 and picked up five or six books.

'They've got to buy some books,' he said, adding that one of his daughters had an assignment.

After going upstairs and looking around the store, Mr Obama was seen with copies of 'Brave New World' and 'The Bayou Trilogy'.

Brave New World is Aldous Huxley's 
1932 dystopian novel about a state which controls the behaviour of its 
people by using technology to keep them superficially happy. Republicans
may well read into the purchase.

The Bayou Trilogy is Daniel Woodrell's work centred around a detective fighting crime in a Louisiana swampland.

On
Saturday Mr Obama said members of Congress should put country before 
politics, set aside their differences and act together to put people 
back to work in his pre-recorded weekly radio and Internet address.

He said that lawmakers in Washington could learn something from the people in small towns in Illinois and Iowa. And if they did, Obama said there are some things they could get done right away, like passing a road construction bill or extending a reduction in the payroll tax.
