A 12-year-old girl who was attacked by a rabid fox on her way to school said she is now afraid to go outside alone.

Sade Boone was waiting for a school bus near her home in Pineville, South Carolina when she was chased and bitten by a fox.

She has had 16 vaccines in the four days since the attack to combat rabies and has received treatment to the wound on her leg, according to ABC News.

Brave: The 12-year-old fought the animal off by putting her hands around its throat. She is now afraid to go outside alone

The brave schoolgirl said she knew an animal was following her as she walked to the bus stop in Berkeley County but she initially thought it was a harmless cat.

The fox charged after she started running away and knocked her to the ground before biting and scratching her.

'I thought it was a cat, and then I 
thought it was a raccoon because of the mouth and after a while it 
started chasing after me,' said Boone.

'I was just strangling it with my own 
hands. My whole hand could fit around his neck, and I was just choking 
it and trying to move my leg out of its mouth,' said Miss Boone.Â

According to ABC News, Miss Boone's family attempted to scare the fox away by hitting it as it grabbed onto her leg. Her grandfather Robert Jenkins shot the animal when it was freed.

He said: 'She turned him loose and I shot him. I was so proud of her 
because it didn't seem like she panicked at all.'

The 12-year-old said, 'I'm still scared to get out the car sometimes and walk outside'. She returned to school two days after the attack.
