A man who falsely claimed benefits under his brother's name for nearly three decades has been found living in a holiday resort on Spain's Costa del Sol.

Retired joiner Norman Brennan, 70, fled to Mijas from Britain five years ago just as he was due to be sentenced for embezzling almost £120,000 under the name of his brother who lived abroad.

Today, as Brennan said he would not return to face justice, Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he would deal with the fugitive fraudster himself.

'This case is outrageous,' the politician said.

On the run: Norman Brennan, 70, has been found in Spain after fleeing the UK where he'd admitted fraud

'No': Norman Brennan told the Sky News reporter that he would not return to Britain to face charges

Brenna, formerly of Netherton, Merseyside, fled the UK in 2008 after pleading guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to seven combined charges of council tax, housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance fraud.

For years he had claimed the benefits, which totalled nearly £120,000, in the name of his brother, Leslie, who had lived in Germany for nearly 30 years.

Brennan was given bail when sentencing was adjourned, but gave authorities the slip and left the country.

It is believed he went straight to Mijas where he is said to have bought two adjoining properties in a golfing resort.

Today a television channel tracked down down the pensioner, who has long white hair, a bushy white moustache and uses a stick to walk, to the Spanish village of Mijas Costas.

When asked by the Sky News presenter if the thought he should be in the UK, Brennan simply replied: 'No'.

Mr Duncan Smith told the news channel: 'I’m astonished. I’ll certainly take this case away, and I know that I have myself fraud investigators who are out in Spain already.

'We’ll check this case, and I can promise you that if they haven’t done enough, they will now do their level best to get this man back.

'This sort of case is outrageous, and I’ll deal with it.'

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Merseyside Police can confirm assistance was provided to Sefton Council and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) with their original investigation into Mr Brennan.

'Since the issue of an arrest warrant for Mr Brennan in 2008 the force has been working with other agencies to locate and affect his arrest. This work is ongoing.'

An international arrest warrant remains in place for Brennan.
