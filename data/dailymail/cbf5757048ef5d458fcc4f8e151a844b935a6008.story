Rickie Lambert has revealed he turned down the chance to move to Aston Villa because he wasn't given enough time to think about it.

The Midlands outfit attempted to sign the former Southampton forward on transfer deadline day in January in a bid to ease their troubles in front of goal.

But the move broke down late on, something Lambert said was due to the time constraints

Lambert has struggled for game time this season due to the high quality of his Liverpool team-mates

'I wasn't aware of any interest until deadline day,' Lambert told the Liverpool Echo. 'I got a phone call from the gaffer about 4pm saying Aston Villa had come in. He said he didn't want me to go but basically offered me the chance if I wanted to play football, which is fair enough.

'I spoke to my agent, I spoke to my wife, I spoke to Aston Villa and it was close. It was very close. It was touch and go. We agreed everything.

'The deal was agreed, but in the end, there just wasn't enough time to say 'yes' - to make a decision in the space of four or five hours for the next two-and-a-half-years. Not just for me, but for my family as well.

'It was something I just couldn't do. It was too short notice. It was too big of a decision to make in the short amount of time I had.'
