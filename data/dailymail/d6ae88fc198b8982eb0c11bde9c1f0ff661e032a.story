Angelina Jolie lookalike Luminita Perijoc has been arrested again after flipping out when taxi drivers refused to take her

An Angelina Jolie lookalike who was given a suspended sentence after forcing a taxi driver to have sex with her at knifepoint has been arrested again for disturbing the peace when she couldn't get a cab. 

Luminita Perijoc was given a suspended four year jail term last month when she dragged taxi driver, Nicolae Stan into her house and forced him to have intercourse and perform oral sex during the incident in 2012 in Romania.

In this latest incident, Perijoc was at a four-star hotel in the town of Tulcea near the seaside Black Sea resort when she attempted to call a taxi.

But the first driver that arrived spotted the 32-year-old, who models herself on the Hollywood actress, is said to have put his foot down and sped off.

The hotel apologised and called her a second cab, which also drove off, after the driver said if he took the passenger, his wife would divorce him.

The taxi company then said they had no drivers free to take her.

But the news failed to impress Perijoc, who was supposed to be going to meet her mother in the nearby village of Cataloi.

A staff member at the hotel, who declined to be named, said she shouted: 'These guys are all idiots, do they think I am going to jump on every taxi driver I meet?'

Then fearing that the enraged woman was about to attack them, the hotel staff called police, who said she now faces a charge of disturbing the peace.

During her first trial, the court heard that Perijoc suffered from a bad temper and struggled sometimes to control her anger, which even her family admitted was sometimes a problem.

The terrified cab driver locked himself in the bathroom during the 2012 incident and used his mobile telephone to call police to rescue him.

The court had initially jailed her, but converted it to a suspended sentence on appeal after hearing that she had taken medication that had meant that she lost control on the night of the attack.

Because of her resemblance to Angelina Jolie, the story not only made international headlines, but it also made her a household name in Romania.

Friends told local media that Perijoc has now taken up professional boxing in a bit to get rid of some of her excess energy.
