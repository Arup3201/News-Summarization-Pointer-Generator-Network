Immigrant mothers: More than a quarter of births in Britain last year were to mothers born outside the UK

A record number of nearly 200,000 babies were born to immigrant mothers last year, figures revealed yesterday.

The children of women who were themselves born abroad made up nearly a quarter of all the babies born in Britain.

The report by the Office for National Statistics pointed to the growing impact on the population of the historically high levels of immigration in recent years.

It said understanding the impact of childbearing among migrants is ‘essential for planning services such as maternity provision and schools’. The figures showed that 24 per cent of births in 2011 were to women who had not themselves been born in Britain, which is the best indicator statisticians have for who is an immigrant.

In London, where a high proportion of migrants choose to live, the share of births to foreign-born mothers was well over half, 57 per cent.

The five countries from which the greatest numbers of foreign-born mothers came were Poland, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nigeria.

The share of new babies born to migrant mothers has more than doubled in 20 years and continues to shoot up.

According to the ONS analysis, the 
number of babies born to British-born mothers barely changed in the five
 years from 2007 to 2011, up from 603,000 to 612,000.

However migrant 
mother births went up from 169,000 to 196,000, an increase of 16 per 
cent.

The report said there had been a 24 
per cent rise in the number of women of childbearing age who were born 
outside the UK and a fall of 5 per cent in the number of UK women of 
childbearing age since 2007.

It added that mothers from Poland, who
 gave birth to 23,000 children in Britain last year, are now at the top 
of the league table of foreign-born mothers in Britain even though birth
 rates in Poland itself are low.

‘This can be explained by the younger 
age structure of the population born in Poland and by timing effects, 
given that the majority of those born in Poland will be people of young 
working age who have migrated to the UK since EU accession in 2004.’

Nearly 6,000 babies were born to 
mothers who were themselves born in Germany, enough to put Germany 
seventh on the list of countries from which migrant mothers come.

However the report pointed out that 
‘many of those born in Germany will be British nationals whose parents 
were serving in the armed forces in Germany at the time of their birth’.

The ONS added: ‘The increase in the 
proportion of births to non-UK born mothers living in the UK illustrates
 how the demographic make-up of the UK is changing.’ The report said 
there were marked regional differences in the fertility rates of women, 
both of those born abroad and those born in Britain.

Overall, foreign-born women were 
likely to have 2.28 children during their lives, while British born 
women could expect, at 2011 fertility rates, to bear 1.89 children.

But there was a bigger gap in London, 
where fertility rates were higher for foreign-born women and where 
fertility rates for British-born women were ‘well below average’.

This may be because a higher 
proportion of British-born women in London than elsewhere are pursuing 
education and careers and delaying childbirth and families.

Priscilla Gavioli and family

Brazilian-born Priscilla Gavioli, 34, gave birth to her son Daniel in July at the Whittington Hospital in North London.

Miss Gavioli, who works in banking, arrived in London in 1996 as an 18-year-old looking for a better future.

Six years later she met her partner, 39-year-old Steven Gray, and the couple now live in Muswell Hill.

Miss Gavioli said when she first arrived there were more opportunities for her in London than in Brazil.

But she added: ‘The opportunities seem to have reversed. Brazil is booming now. If there was something for us to do there we might consider going back. All my family still live there.’

The couple are acutely aware of the pressure childcare costs will have on their finances.

Mr Gray, who works in the media, said: ‘A nursery will cost us £1,200 per month. I’d like a second child, but it’s so expensive.’
