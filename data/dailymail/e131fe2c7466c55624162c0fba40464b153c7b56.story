If Mesut Ozil leaves Arsenal for Bayern Munich he will be considered an expensive Premier League flop 

True measure of a top coach like Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal is to find a lower-league gem and make him into a world beater like Ian Rush or Stuart Pearce

Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere have a telepathic understanding that gives England a fighting chance at Euro 2016

Less than three weeks before Raheem Sterling was too tired to start for England in Estonia, he was one of only a couple of regular members of the Liverpool starting XI who had played the full 120 minutes of the Capital One Cup tie with Middlesbrough, and endured the draining nervous tension of a very lengthy penalty shootout.

He has started all but one of his club's games this season, and played the full 90 minutes in most of them.

So what happened in Tallinn? Did Roy Hodgson ignore Brendan Rodgers' dossier again? Or did the Liverpool boss forget to put the note detailing Sterling’s nap times in his satchel when he sent him off for his trip with the England squad?

I’m being flippant when actually this is a very serious issue. Amid the inevitable finger-pointing and blaming that is going on, there is a very real problem facing Rodgers, and that is a teenager facing burnout two months into the season. No surprise that Liverpool wanted Sterling left out in Estonia. The real test will come this Saturday.

Nobody can be in any doubt that Sterling will need to be given a few days off – including the weekend trip to his old club Queens Park Rangers. Coming up after that of course, it’s a crucial double header with Real Madrid.

Sterling played a huge number of games last season, and then went to the World Cup and played in all three of England’s matches. Liverpool being without Luis Suarez now means the 19-year-old is very much in demand.

It’s not just the physical effect of playing games, it’s the level of expectation that may well be weighing heavy on his shoulders.

If he were at Chelsea, or Real, or Manchester City, the quality and depth of their squads would mean he would get a break. 

Rodgers doesn’t have that luxury. The one time he left Sterling out of the starting line-up this season, Liverpool lost at home to Aston Villa.

With Suarez gone, Sterling is now the go-to guy when Liverpool need a match winner, a bit of magic, something special. Not even England place that burden on him – Wayne Rooney fills that role for the country he captains and his years of experience mean he can deal with it no problem.

Sterling is one of Liverpool's bright young stars

Sterling was named Liverpool’s young player of the year in May – he’s too young for these kind of demands. That’s surely contributed to his tiredness.

He isn’t under pressure with England – Hodgson’s side won their toughest qualifier in Switzerland, and have virtually won the group already.

What makes a teenage footballer tired? Playing against San Marino? Training before a game in Estonia? It's more likely to be the pressure of playing week in, week out and having to produce star quality performances in the Premier League and Champions League.

Rodgers could have gone out and tried to sign a star after Suarez left. But he chose instead to build a bigger squad, with players way below Suarez's quality. 

That was Rodgers' decision but it means now the pressure of being the man to replace Suarez isn’t placed on Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert or Lazar Markovic. It has fallen on Sterling.

Is he old enough to cope with that pressure? Does he have that experience? He’s got the quality – that’s not up for debate. But he is still developing and growing as a player, so the last thing he needs is to be used as some sort of pawn in the managerial mind games between Rodgers and Hodgson.

Sure, Liverpool pay his wages and Rodgers has the right to pick whatever team he wants.

But he also can’t ignore the fact that this teenage sensation is being overplayed.

Let’s see if Sterling starts at Loftus Road.
