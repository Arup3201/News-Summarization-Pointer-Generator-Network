Reigning champion Andy Murray was back at Wimbledon on Tuesday as he prepared for his second-round match against Blaz Rola.

Murray was joined by his coach Amelie Mauresmo as he fine-tuned his game ahead of his second-round game on Wednesday.

The 2013 winner brushed aside David Goffin 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 in the opening match on Centre Court on Monday.

Meanwhile, Tim Henman hopes Murray’s partnership with new coach Mauresmo will prove to be a long-term arrangement.

Murray has hired the Frenchwoman initially for the grass-court season but both have already stated their intention to work together for longer.

Mauresmo has so far been even more of a high-profile appointment than her predecessor Ivan Lendl, who guided Murray to his first two grand slam titles in their two and a half years together.

Henman told Press Association: 'I think it’s certainly an interesting choice. I think the timing of it is not that straightforward, coming in at this time of year, trying to build that relationship when the eyes of the world are on them both.

'But I certainly do hope it works, because the continuity for him is really important, so I think they should stick together for a good while now. Chopping and changing I don’t think is so good for him in the long-run, so fingers crossed it works out well.'

Murray’s decision to choose a female coach, the highest-profile male player ever to do so, has been the talk of tennis over the past two weeks.

Most people have been positive about the appointment but there have been dissenters, most notably fellow former Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade.

'The only things he can control are preparation and performance,' said Henman. 'What’s been talked about in the press, on the television and radio, people’s opinions on his new coach, he can’t control that, so there’s no point in worrying about that.

'Coming back as defending champion, it’s massively exciting for everyone. I think the draw’s been favourable to him, there are a few tricky ones out there, but on the whole he’s got a pretty good section.

'But again that means nothing - he’s got to go out and earn that favourable draw. He was able to do that last year and hopefully he can get on a roll again this year.'

Murray's second-round opponent Rola, 23, only began playing on the tour full-time this season after studying at university in America and broke into the top 100 for the first time last month.

The Slovenian cited playing Ward at Queen’s two weeks ago as his biggest match before Wimbledon and the prize of playing the home champion gave him an extra incentive in his first-round match against Pablo Andujar.
