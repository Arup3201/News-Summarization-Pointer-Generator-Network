South African police are investigating President Jacob Zuma over a £14.5million taxpayer-funded refurbishment project at his rural homestead, according to parliamentary papers.

In a written police response to lawmakers published Monday, police confirmed that an investigation into spending at Zuma's Nkandla home 'has been initiated.'

Zuma, who was reelected in May, has insisted that he had no knowledge of the work on his home, including the construction of a swimming pool, private clinic and amphitheatre.

His government has insisted all the refurbishments were security related.

The issue has become a lightning rod for criticism of Zuma's administration, which is seen by many South Africans as tolerant of corruption and incompetence.

The scandal, known as ‘Nkandla’ after the nearest town to the sprawling property, has sparked massive resentment at the lifestyle enjoyed by the President and his extended family while millions of South Africans continue to live in poverty, despite the end of apartheid 20 years ago. 

Opposition leader, Mmusi Maimane, of the Democratic Alliance said 'now the police must do their jobs.'

Maimane and other opposition politicians had called for Zuma to be the subject of a criminal investigation over the issue, and have demanded he resign.

A damning report by the country’s top anti-corruption official in March described improvements at the residence used by Mr Zuma, his four wives and more than 20 children, as an 'unconscionable and excessive misappropriation of public funds'. 

The public ombudsman Thuli Madonsela ruled that Zuma had 'benefited unduly' from the construction, ordering him to payback some of the money spent on the home.

The report, entitled ‘Secure in Comfort’, established that while a personal clinic and house for police officers might reasonably form part of a security plan.

However, the amphitheatre, visitors’ centre and extensive new facilities for the Zuma family’s chickens and cattle could not. 

An earlier internal government probe into the renovations had found that the works were essential for the president’s security.

In plans, the swimming pool was described as 'a fire pool' required in the event of a blaze at the largely-thatched residence.  

Zuma has faced both political and public wrath of the excessive spending, in a country battling rampant unemployment and inequality.

Mr Zuma is also no stranger to controversy, having faced rape and corruption charges before becoming president.
