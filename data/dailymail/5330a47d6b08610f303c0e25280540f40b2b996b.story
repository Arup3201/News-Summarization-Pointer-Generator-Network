Court documents have revealed that the newlywed bride who is charged with pushing her husband to his death during a hike in Montana reportedly wanted to avoid a police investigation.

A friend told investigators that Jordan Graham went back to the scene of the crime to search for her husband Cody Johnson's body herself days after he died.

The friend said that Graham wanted the search called off and 'the cops out of it'.

The documents collected by federal prosecutors also describe an email from a person named Tony that said Johnson had fallen to his death and called for an end to the search.

Investigators say the message was sent from an account using a computer registered to Graham's father.

Graham has pleaded not guilty to murder and making a false statement.

Police believe the newlywed pushed her husband off a cliff in Montana's Glacier National Park after a heated argument which is thought to be over him asking her for an annulment.

'One of the police theories is that the new bride "snapped" after her husband figured out she had lied about being in love with him. She was only in love with the idea of being a bride,' a source close to the investigation told the National Enquirer.

The source also revealed that authorities believe Cody told her he 
wanted a divorce or an annulment and she couldn't face telling her friends 
her husband already wanted out of the week-old marriage, so she came up with a crazy plan to kill him and make it look like an accident, it is believed.

The couple had been together for less than two years when they got married and it is said both of them were having doubts about tying the knot.

A friend of the accused murderer told
the Enquirer: 'Jordan was a dreamer who was more excited about the idea
of marriage than actually being married.

'She loved picking the wedding dress 
and showing off her ring, but on the day of the actual wedding, she 
sobbed uncontrollably.'Â 

The Kalispell woman has insisted from the very beginning that her husband's death was an accident. Their tragic story has garnered national media attention almost from the very beginning, with Graham even pleading her case on magazine covers.

Married only eight days when Mr Johnson, 25, disappeared July 7, Graham first told investigators that Johnson's 'buddies from Washington probably came and got him,' according to the indictment.

Investigators have accused the widowed woman of pushing her husband off a cliff down onto a viewing area known as the Loop during a July 7 argument after having second thoughts about the marriage.

Reported missing on July 8 when he did
not show up at work, authorities were unable to find Mr Johnson's body 
until July 11 when Graham told officials she found it in the hard to 
reach spot after she thought to look there.

Ms Johnson cryptically told investigators 'it was a place he wanted to see before he died'.

As time wore on, and investigators began piecing together their case against Graham, her story began to change.

Having first told authorities that 
her dead husband drove off in a dark car the night he disappeared, 
Graham admitted July 16 they had an argument at the park the night he 
died.

Graham told investigators she and Mr Johnson
argued on the trail. When he grabbed her 
arm as she turned to walk away, she pushed him with both hands in 
the back, causing him to fall head-first from a steep cliff, according to an 
affidavit.

Earlier that day, Graham told a friend she was having second thoughts about getting married and meant to talk to Johnson about it, according to the affidavit. She said if the friend didn't hear from her again that night, 'something happened.'

Two people who knew the couple told local Montana newspaper that they had their doubts about the wedding.
