Darren Fletcher has challenged former Manchester United duo Cristiano Ronaldo and Wes Brown as the next personnel to take  part in the Ice Bucket Challenge, after the Manchester United midfielder pledged his support to it in aid of the James McCarthy Foundation.

The Manchester United midfielder was only too happy to receive two buckets of ice cold water over his head, dedicating it to James McCarthy, a young man from Manchester who has suffered with illness ever since a car crash in 2009.

Both Paul Scholes and Gary Neville had already undertaken the challenge after the Class of 92 match which took place last week.

And Fletcher soon after completed the challenge, nominating former Manchester United team-mates Brown and Ronaldo to take it up next.

So far over £9,000 has been raised through the initiative which has been heavily publicised over social networking site Twitter. 

Elsewhere, Fletcher and his team-mates begin a new era under Louis van Gaal when they entertain Swansea on Saturday afternoon in the opening weekend of the Premier League season.
