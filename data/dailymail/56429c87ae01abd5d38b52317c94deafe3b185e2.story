If you had the odd moment of deja vu during the last series of Downton Abbey, then don’t worry – there’s a reason some of those beautiful gowns looked familiar.

Despite the ITV show’s £12million budget, attentive viewers may have spotted that some of its leading ladies wore Hollywood hand-me-downs.

Lavish dresses worn by stars including Catherine Zeta Jones, Emma Thompson and Uma Thurman have been recycled and given the Downton treatment to save money.

Truly vintage: Lady Mary, pictured left in a blouse first worn by Emma Thompson's character Howard's End, pictured right

A red dress worn by Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary Crawley, for example, was first seen on Miss Zeta Jones in the 2007 thriller Death Defying Acts.

In fact the pair have shared two outfits. The second is a floral blouse first worn by Miss Thompson 20 years ago in the film Howards End.

It was then passed on to Miss Zeta Jones, again in Death Defying Acts, before ending up in Lady Mary’s wardrobe.

It is not the only costume shared by Zeta Jones and Dockery.

The Downton actress recycles a red dress worn by the Welsh Actress in the same 2007 film opposite Guy Pearce.

Continuing the trend, Dockery wears a fetching silky green dress 
with sheer arms, a frock that had previously been worn by Radha 
Mitchell when portraying the wife of Peter Pan author J. M. Barrie in 
Finding Neverland in 2004.

And on a separate occasion, she is seen in an elaborate black choker so 
distinctive that viewers remembered Monica Bellucci wearing the same 
accessory in the film Brotherhood Of The Wolf almost a decade 
ago.

Eagle-eyed viewers also noticed that 
Cora Crawley, played by Elizabeth McGovern, wore an adapted version of a
dress sported 12 years ago by Miss Thurman, in Henry James’s The Golden
Bowl.

And in the first series, Laura 
Carmichael’s Lady Edith Crawley wore a white dress from ITV’s 2007 
adaptation of EM Forster’s A Room With a View.

According to Katie Bugg, a designer who runs Recycledmoviecostumes.com this is common practice on expensive productions to ensure budgets don't overrun.

She states: 'Recycled movie costumes are gowns that often appear in one production and then go on to be used in another.

'Many
movies have very small costume budgets, which means that instead of 
making all of the costumes, the designer is forced to rent costumes from
a costume house.

'Sometimes costumes are altered significantly to give it a new look, and
sometimes the dress is used as it appeared for the first time.'

Downton’s costume designer Susannah 
Box has previously said only a third of the show’s outfits are new. ‘We 
couldn’t have done all of them – it would have cost a fortune, way over 
our budget,’ she said.

Tim Angel, whose costume firm Angels 
provided many of Downtown Abbey’s frocks, said: ‘I would say around 
two-thirds of the costumes you see in Downton are from stock and have 
been used before.

'There
is nothing wrong with that. You can’t supply originals to everyone 
because it would make an already expensive programme simply 
unaffordable.’

Dockery is not the only actress that has been caught out by eagle-eyed viewers.

Elizabeth McGovern, 
who plays Cora Crawley, adorns a very similar outfit to Uma Thurman's 
character in The Golden Bowl, although the gown appears to have been 
altered slightly by dressmakers.

Dame Maggie Smith as Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham also appears in a long-sleeved, teal silk dress. as worn by Thurman in the same 2000 film.

Despite
the cost cutting measure, some characters, such as Samantha Bond’s Lady
Rosamund Painswick, were dressed entirely in outfits hired from 
outside.

Recycledmoviecostumes.com, showcases many similar examples from other period dramas.

One brown dress has appeared in seven productions over the past 
15 years, including Pride & Prejudice, Vanity Fair, Little Dorrit 
and The Secret Diaries Of Miss Anne Lister.

Meanwhile, a yellow ball gown created for the 1994 film The Madness 
Of King George has made six more appearances, one of them in a 2006 
episode of Doctor Who.

Downton
Abbey, which tells the story of a fictional estate in North Yorkshire, 
first aired in September 2010 and has since been nominated for four 
Golden Globe Awards.

A third season will be broadcast in September this year.
