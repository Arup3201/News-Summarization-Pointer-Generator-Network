West Ham striker Andy Carroll arrived back in London on Monday night with his new fiancee Billi Mucklow after proposing to the TV star during a trip to Rome. 

Carroll, who has been dating the former TOWIE star since last summer, popped the question on Sunday before touching back down in the capital the following evening.

The 25-year-old, who could make his long-awaited return to the West Ham squad for this weekend's match against Aston Villa, was pictured with his new fiancee as the pair set off from the airport in the Italian capital.

Carroll has not appeared for West Ham this season after suffering an ankle injury in July but could return to squad for Saturday's Premier League match against struggling Aston Villa, as Allardyce's side look to continue their impressive start to the season.

The Hammers came from two goals down on Saturday to draw 2-2 away at Stoke as they dropped to fifth in the Premier League.
