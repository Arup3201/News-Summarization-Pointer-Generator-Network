Nico Rosberg’s turquoise gloves waved defeat from the cockpit of his ailing Mercedes. And so, after four months of misfortune, hurt and rancour, Lewis Hamilton was handed the World Championship lead.

Rosberg’s race-ending gesture while sitting in the pit lane having completed just 13 laps was the result of electrical problems that beset him from the moment he turned out of the Mercedes garage here under the floodlit splendour of Singapore.

A broken steering column forced him to go straight back for a replacement even before the race had started, and he returned to the grid just in time for lights out.

But that did him no good. He could not get going and remained glued to his grid place — second, behind Hamilton — as the formation lap began around him.

So the German’s mechanics wheeled him into the pit lane, from where he started.

Still the gremlins continued to curse him. His gears were jumping about like a box of frogs. He was helpless as he went from third to fifth, from fifth to seventh, and so on.

Mercedes had no choice but to call him into the pits, by which time he had gamely passed Max Chilton in his Marussia, but nobody else.

He chugged in, needing to stall the car to stop it. His team had intended to fit his car with a new steering column but, unable to resuscitate him, he declared his afternoon’s driving over.

Rosberg kept his helmet on as he trudged around the garage disconsolately, but that could only partly hide his emotions. Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team boss, consoled him.

Hamilton, who for most of the season has trailed his Mercedes team-mate in the championship, now leads him by three points 

Vivian Rosberg, wife of the Mercedes driver, provides some encouraging words for her husband following his retirement from the Singapore Grand Prix 

So did Vivian, his wife of three months. He soon went to the pit wall to watch Hamilton win, his eyes beadily fixed on the screens.

‘It was the toughest day of the year,’ he said afterwards. ‘It was even worse than Silverstone (where his gear box broke when he was leading).

‘None of the steering wheel functions worked — so I had no DRS, and so on. The gears were all over the place. My brake balance was totally wrong. Everything was all over the place.’

Other than for the 28°C heat and 75 per cent humidity, it should have been a straightforward task for Hamilton to convert his chance of victory, which had been set up not only by Rosberg’s misfortune but by his own splendid qualifying lap that conjured pole position out of hot air.

But it did not go quite so smoothly as that when the safety car was called into action halfway through the race, after Adrian Sutil of Sauber had hit Sergio Perez’s Force India.

The interruption cut Hamilton’s lead, yet he still needed to change his tyres and get out ahead of his pursuers, who did not require new rubber.

So he had to re-establish a big enough gap to Sebastian Vettel in second place — about 27 seconds — to pit and come out in front.

Fastest Lap: Lewis Hamilton,1:50.417, lap 39.

Hamilton grew anxious as he tried to establish that impregnable margin. He told his engineer, Peter Bonnington, that his rear tyres might explode.

Now, Bonnington has the reassuring tone of a nurse with a needle saying: ‘You’ll just feel a small prick.’ It was in those soothing tones he called in Hamilton, his tyres fading and his lead standing at just over 25 seconds.

Hamilton came out behind Vettel but, in just over a lap, he had squeezed past him, victory now assured.

He patted his car afterwards and was cheered by a crowd containing a rich smattering of expats employed in the skyscrapers that provide part of the evocative backdrop to the Marina Bay circuit. Plenty of Australian flags were waved for him as well.

This was the perfect result for Hamilton: maximum points while Rosberg scored none. It gave the Briton a lead — three points — for the first time since before the Monaco Grand Prix at the end of May.

‘I was dreaming it last night but you never really think it’s going to happen,’ said Hamilton. 

After a tumultuous first half of the season, Hamilton has finally picked up some consistency and managed to rid himself of the mechanical problems that had plagued him

Current world champion Sebastian Vettel has struggled for form this season, and has often been outshone by team-mate Ricciardo

There is a serenity in Hamilton’s mood since he turned up in Monza, a race he also won. But experience tells us that his psyche is brittle.

Can he ride out the inevitable stresses of the final five races? Upon the answer may hinge the destiny of the title.

The presence of his father Anthony here for a second successive race may be the crucial fillip. He has never won a title without his dad and mainstay at his side.

Anthony said: ‘He has the right perspective about where he is. Win, lose or draw it’s Formula One, the greatest sport on the planet. Just don’t take it too seriously. He’s very calm because he’s enjoying it. Everything comes to those who wait.’

Vettel took second place and Daniel Ricciardo third in a satisfying day for Red Bull, whose pre-season started so unpropitiously that they sat out virtually all the first test.

Their reliability is now sometimes embarrassing the Mercedes super-team. But Red Bull boss Christian Horner said last night he still does not believe in favouring Ricciardo through the imposition of team orders, even though he is 60 points behind Hamilton and Vettel is 117 adrift.

With the final race in Abu Dhabi worth double points, they may yet prevail if Mercedes keep conking out.
