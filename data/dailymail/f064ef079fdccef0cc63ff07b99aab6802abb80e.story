Holidaymakers are being urged not to panic after leading ski resorts across the Alps and the Pyrenees delayed their openings by at least a week due to a lack of snow.

Upmarket resorts such as Courchevel and Meribel had planned to open on December 6, but are now pushing that back to December 13.

It comes after unusually warm temperatures caused early snowfall in November to melt.

In some areas, slopes have been left almost entirely bare.

However, travel experts said that the delays in opening would not affect British holidaymakers as the ski seasons for the majority of UK tour operators don’t start until late December.

Instead, it is typically only locals who use the slopes in the first two weeks of opening.

Lynsey Devon, a spokesman Heaven publicity that represents a number of leading ski resorts, told the MailOnline: ‘Most tour operators don’t sell holidays that begin before December 20.

Meribel's webcam also showed bare slopes today, although experts insist snow is due in the coming days

‘It’s only locals who use the slopes in the first couple of weeks, but they don’t buy ski holidays – they just turn up, so they won’t be out of pocket.

‘The resorts obviously don’t want weekend skiers using up the snow if there has been very little falling on the slopes, so by delaying the opening of the resorts they are preventing that from happening.

‘Widespread snowfall is expected in the coming days, in some cases there will be up to 80 percent cover.

‘If the worst does happen, resorts like Courcheval have invested in cutting edge snow machines which are capable of covering slopes in inches of artificial snow from bare grass in a matter of hours.'

Despite their efficiency, the machines are estimated to cost up to £5 per cubic metre of manmade snow.

‘They have invested around £3million in Snow Factory machines which can fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in just thirty minutes,’ said Ms Devon.

France remains the most popular ski destination for British skiers, and 400,000 tourists from the UK chose Austria as their ski destination last year.

News of the delayed opening comes after the Montgenevre resort in France revealed it has postponed its opening indefinitely, along with others in the region.

‘We opened on the weekend of Nov 22. Then the rain and thaw damaged the snow at the bottom of the slopes,’ said a spokeswoman for Montgenevre, near Italy.

Courchevel is one of France's most popular ski resorts and is usually covered in thick snow at this time of year

According to the national weather service, there is very little snow below 2,000m for this time of year - and in some cases none at all - but snowfall is forecast for the end of the week.

And in the eastern Jura range, the Metabief resort has also decided to open later for the same reasons.

Snow-making machines have already been placed on the slopes of Gschwandtkopf mountain in the western Austrian village of Seefeld in a bid to try and attract holidaymakers.

Meribel in the French Alps has also been struggling with the unseasonably warm weather this year

Similar problems have affected other Austrian resorts, including Flachau in Salzburg and Rosskopf mountain in Tirol, at a time when the snow is usually plentiful.

Tourism bosses have blamed the lack of snow on unusually warm winter weather.

But temperatures in the Alps were recently revealed to be rising faster than anywhere else in the world, with Alpine resorts attempting to adapt to climate change.

A recent Austrian climate report found the country’s temperatures had risen twice as fast as the global average since 1880, with the number of sunshine hours in the Alps increasing by 20 per cent.
