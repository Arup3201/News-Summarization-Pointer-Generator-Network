One of the largest natural landslides in recent years took place in a remote area of southeastern Alaska on February 16, when 68 million tonnes of rock and debris crashed down a mountainside leaving deposits 40 foot deep.

Large landslides in remote locations used to go unnoticed, but a new crowdsourcing approach involving a UK-based blogger, an Alaskan helicopter pilot and NASA, helped scientists pinpoint the exact location of this latest slide.

This innovative new approach is the result of the discovery last year by two Columbia University scientists that seismic data can reveal the time, force, direction, and speed of a large landslide.

Unlike earthquakes, which release bursts
 of energy for a few seconds, landslides create sustained seismic 
readings that can last many minutes.

So when this recent big landslide occurred, its rumblings were quickly picked up by the network of seismic sensors in place around the globe to detect earthquakes. 

That seismic data put the Alaskan whopper somewhere in the vicinity of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.

Unfortunately the seismometers can only locate where a landslide occurs to within 30 kilometers and from there it took a coordinated effort to track it down.

Key to this crowdsourcing effort was geographer Dave Petley who works at Durham University in the U.K. and also runs The Landslide Blog.

Scientists estimate that the debris flowed 4.8 kilometers downhill and left deposits as deep as 40 feet, almost the height of a five-story building.

‘I post the details and approximate location of the landslide, and we then, in effect, crowdsource finding it,’ he told Wired.

His blog post was noticed by geomorpholgist Marten Geertsema of the University of Northern British Columbia, who contacted Alaskan helicopter pilot Drake Olson.

About a week after the landslide occurred, Olson flew to the location and photographed the exact region where it happened, on the flank of Mount La Perouse.

From the images, Petley estimated that the debris flowed 4.8 kilometers downhill and left deposits as deep as 40 feet, almost the height of a five-story building.

NASA was also involved and their 
Earth-observing satellite Landsat 8 was used to take before and after 
shots of the impact area from space.

Without
 this coordinated online effort, Petley said, the Mount La Perouse 
landslide might never have been spotted as snow quickly cover the 
impacted area.

The new technique has helped scientists realize that landslides are much more common than once thought.

‘We used to think they were pretty rare, But we’ve probably just missed them in the past,’ said Petley.

Researchers now think that roughly half a dozen big landslides happen in a typical year, though a massive earthquake can trigger as many as 40 large landslides.

In recent years, the Landslide Blog has posted different teleseismic landslide detection events and the posts have helped to elicit help from NASA and other researchers and amateurs to help identify the event from the ground or space.
