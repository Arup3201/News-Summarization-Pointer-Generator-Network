Elderly people struggling to pay soaring energy bills should only heat their living rooms in an attempt to stay warm this winter, according to the Government.

Guidance also suggests that hard-pressed pensioners should only put the heating on in their bedrooms shortly before going to sleep.

Furthermore, it tells elderly people to look after themselves with plenty of hot food and drinks, eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, and wearing plenty of layers.

The advice from Public Health England and the Department of Health is an attempt to reduce the thousands of avoidable deaths each year caused by flu and infections.

The ‘Cold Weather Plan’ suggests that living rooms should be heated to temperatures of 21C (70F) and the rest of the house to 18C (65F). Public Health England said ‘too many avoidable deaths’ are recorded each winter, with  an estimated 24,000 deaths caused by cold weather in England and Wales.

The Government body developed the guidance with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association.

It said the causes of death are complex, interlinked with fuel poverty, poor housing and health inequalities, also blaming ‘circulating infectious diseases, particularly flu and norovirus, and the extent of snow and ice’.

As part of its advice to the public, the report says measures should be taken to reduce heat waste, such as fitting draught-proofing to seal any gaps around windows and doors.

It also mentions loft insulation, keeping curtains closed to keep in heat and making sure radiators are not obstructed by furniture or curtains.

The report says: ‘If you can’t heat all the rooms you use, heat the living room throughout the day and your bedroom just before you go to bed. Remember to close curtains and shut doors to keep heat in the rooms you use most.’

Despite admitting that household temperatures below those recommended in the report ‘may risk your health’, it says that higher temperatures ‘may waste money’.

Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at PHE, said: ‘In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma.

‘There are a range of health problems associated with cold housing and winter weather, but in particular, a cold indoor or outdoor environment can make heart and respiratory problems worse, and can be fatal.

Public health minister Jane Ellison said: ‘The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during the winter months so it’s crucial that people stay warm and that we all find time to check in on those who may be vulnerable.

‘Young children, older people and at-risk groups are also vulnerable to flu which is why all two and three-year-olds and those over 65 are being offered the flu vaccine.

‘It’s also vital that health services are ready to cope with the inevitable increase in pressure as temperatures drop, which is why I strongly encourage all frontline NHS staff to get their flu vaccine.

‘We are also investing £500million over the next two years to help ensure A&E departments are well prepared for winter.’
