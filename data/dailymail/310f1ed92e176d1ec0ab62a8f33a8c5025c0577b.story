A young girl has been left with a badly burnt face which could see her scarred for the rest of her life after an accident at her local market at the weekend.

Belinda Campos, from Lilyfield in Sydney's inner-west, goes to the Orange Grove Markets every Saturday morning with her husband and daughter Gracie, who is almost three. 

But on Saturday while Ms Campos was visiting a different stall to usual Gracie decided to take a peek in a pie warmer that was sitting at the front of the stall on a trestle table.

'My daughter was literally standing right next to me and I turned around and she had started screaming,' Ms Campos told Daily Mail Australia. 

On Saturday Belinda Campos had to rush her daughter Gracie (pictured) to emergency after she suffered burns to her chin

'She basically looked at the pie, went in for a closer look and burnt her chin,' she continued.

'I asked the guy at the stall if this is hot and he sort of looked past me and went to serve the next customer.'

Ms Campos grabbed her daughter and headed home as soon as the accident happened, before calling a close friend who works as a nurse for advice.

After rushing to the emergency department at Balmain Hospital, she spent the next few hours there with her young daughter with cold presses on her chin as doctors tried to examine the damage.

'It blistered up really quickly and it has been weeping,' Ms Campos revealed.

Sharing her story as a caution for other parents out there, the Lilyfield mother is now looking for answers.

Ms Campos said Gracie has not been herself since the accident and also missed out on her first ever swimming lesson which was supposed to take place later on Saturday.

She spent hours in emergency and could be scarred for the rest of her life 

'You know she's not herself, she's quite an active child but she's just been laying on the couch,' Ms Campos said.

'Until the new skin grows through we've got to be really careful.'

Gracie may have permanent scar from the burn, but will be unable to tell for at least the next few months until her face completely heals.

'When fresh skin comes through it's going to be lighter than her olive skin... we wont know for a few months if it will scar permanently,' Ms Campos said.

The mother has been in contact with the market organisers - Organic Food Markets - who said while they try and keep an eye on all stall-holders they do not carry out extensive checks each week.

'It's a collaborative process', Steven Choularton, Director Organic Food Markets told Daily Mail Australia.

'We regret any child being hurt and although it was not something we did directly, we will make every effort to prevent it happening again,' he continued. 

Mr Choularton has been in contact with the owner of the stall where the incident took place, and said a number of suggestions have been put forward to the stall-holder so that another similar incident can be prevented. 

Those guidelines were that a sign should be stuck to the pie-warmer to notify people it is hot, although the admitted this would not have helped in this particular case.

Another was to 'move it (the pie-warmer) deeper into the gazebo so it was out of the way', and the third was to 'make a wooden skirt' around the over so it couldn't be touched.

Mr Choularton also suggested that if people see something out of order they notify market stall holders or authorities.

'Wherever you are no matter how safe or dangerous it's important to keep your eyes open for hazards,' he said. 

Ms Campos hopes her daughter will heal in the coming months, and is working to ensure the same thing doesn't happen to anyone else 

Ms Campos said she was shocked at how quickly it happened and wants to prevent it from happening to others.

'I just didn't think to be honest people would have oven that hot so low, I just assumed it would be warm,' she said.

'I can't believe it, I felt so bad because she was just standing right next to me.' 

Ms Campos has also contacted Leichhardt Council 'to guarantee that this isn't going to happen again to anyone else.'

'People do need to be aware, at the Orange Grove Markets there's just kids everywhere.

'It's a kids market so it needs to be safe,' Ms Campos continued.
