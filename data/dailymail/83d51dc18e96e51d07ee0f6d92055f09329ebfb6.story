The heart-stopping moment of the devastating explosion in West, Texas, was captured on video by a man close by, one of several videos displaying the sheer terror from the blast.

The blast at a fertilizer plant at 7:50pm local time on Wednesday has left as many 15 people dead, hundreds injured and 
caused a nursing home to collapse, trapping residents inside.

A resident in the small Texas town, Derrick Hurtt, had parked his car to observe the fire at the plant earlier in the night and was filming the structure as it was engulfed in flames.

Suddenly, something sparked a massive blast, causing flames to shoot into the sky, rocking the family's car as the terrified father and his 12-year-old daughter Khloey tried to scramble to safety.

and flames shot up and toward where the family was parked

Chilling: After the terrifying blast, a child can be heard crying out and pleading with their father to leave the site

'Dad, I can't hear,' Khloey screamed out in agony after the explosion.

'Get out of here. Please get out of here. Daddy, please get out of here,' the child kept repeating in the terrifying audio. 

When the short YouTube clip began, the father was filming the large fire that was burning about 250-300 yards away at the plant.

He sounds relatively calm as he observes the direction of the wind and its strength. 

For about 30 seconds, he captures the burning structure but is totally unaware for the danger that awaits.

Suddenly a massive blast occurs and footage shows flames exploding into the sky and toward the direction of the family's car.

Shaken by the explosion, the father scrambles to turn his car around and drive in the opposite direction.

Khloey is heard pleading with the father to leave and get to safety.

Speaking to the Today show this morning, Mr Hurtt described the scene of the explosion as 'horrific.'

He told host Matt Lauer: 'There was probably double-digit people standing in front of me videoing that were closer than I was, and after the blast, they were nowhere to be seen.'

Mr Hurtt added that the force of the 
blast lifted his truck off the ground, and sent him on top of his 
daughter. He said: 'Things just kind of went black for a moment.'

He said that Khloey and his inner ears are 'a little sore,' but their full hearing has returned.

Other West citizens took to the streets in the wake of the explosion, many unclear of what had actually happened.

YouTube user Paul Lannuier filmed the incredible mushroom cloud that had formed after the blast. A woman on the video can be heard asking him if there had been a plane crash.

A police spokesperson said this morning that five blocks of homes were leveled by the blast and subsequent fires. As many as 15 people are dead and another 160 are injured.

President Obama said in a statement: 'Today our prayers go out to the people of West, Texas in the aftermath of last night’s deadly explosion at a fertilizer plant. A tight-knit community has been shaken, and good, hard-working people have lost their lives.

'I want to thank the first responders who worked tirelessly through the night to contain the situation and treat the wounded.  My Administration, through FEMA and other agencies, is in close contact with our state and local partners on the ground to make sure there are no unmet needs as search and rescue and response operations continue. 

'West is a town that many Texans hold near and dear to their hearts, and as residents continue to respond to this tragedy, they will have the support of the American people.'

Texas Governor Rick Perry tweeted, 'Thoughts and prayers with everyone in West, TX. Thx to all the first responders on the scene.'

Explosion: The blast at the fertilizer plant occurred at 7:50pm (CST) on Wednesday

West, Texas is located 20 miles north of the town of Waco and 40 miles north of the small community of Crawford, where former president George W. Bush has a ranch.

The town, that has a population of 2,600, is actually located in the central part of the Lone Star state. It is 70 miles south of Dallas.

The community of Waco is mobilizing to respond, as many of the victims have been transported to nearby hospitals.

The student body at Baylor University in Waco announced that they would congregate at Waco Hall at midnight for a candlelight prayer service for the town of West.

The school is accepting donations and enlisting volunteers to assist in the response.

Students also began coordinating blood drives for the local medical centers.
