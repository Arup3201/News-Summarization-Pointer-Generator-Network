Undead?: Pub landlord John Teagle, who was accused of being a vampire at his wife Elsa's village

A pub landlord accused of being a vampire by superstitious villagers in the Philippines  has finally won a battle to clear his name.

For the last five years John Teagle, the landlord of the Walmer Castle Pub in Margate, Kent, has been viewed with suspicion by the residents of Argawanon, on Cebu Island in the Philippines.

Werina Onpoc, the aunt of his wife Elsa, who was born on the island, spread the vicious rumour after he refused to lend her cash in 2007.

The 68-year-old dad-of-three, who married Elsa after meeting her 23 years ago through a lonely hearts ad, was shunned after the aunt told local radio that he was a ‘descendant of Dracula’ and drank 
the blood of children.

The aunt even told villagers that scars on Mr Teagle’s body - caused by operations to treat colon cancer - were wounds he suffered as he bolted from police hunting him for being one of the undead.

Mr Teagle, who owns a holiday home on the island and regularly visits, said: 'It made me laugh at first - then I realised how serious it was.'

Now his ordeal is over after Argawanon's Barrio Capitan - a kind of councillor - stepped in after the radio broadcast inflamed the situation.

He interrogated the aunt and others who had made the claims against Mr Teagle at a 500-strong ‘council meeting’ on the island. The chief reprimanded those responsible for the vampire rumours and ordered them to stop.

Mr Teagle said he was ‘very relieved’, but fears that some villagers still have a sneaking suspicion that he is a supernatural creature of the night.

He told the Thanet Times: 'They were severely reprimanded but it still left a very bad taste.

'The deed was done. It’s gone away a lot now, but it’s not dead.'

Elsa Teagle said that villagers in the Philippines 
thought he was coming over from the UK to 'suck their blood' and take it back to the UK to sell to other vampires.

The 49-year-old schoolteacher has three children with John including 22-year-old John Jnr, who helps run the pub, 21-year-old university student Oriana and schoolgirl Asia, 16.

Cebu, situated in the middle of the islands, is the most densely populated of the Philippines

It is just 250 km from north to south and 45 km across at its widest point

Its eastern coastline is popular hub for divers and the island's largest city, Cebu City, has an international port

Filipinos are known for being superstitious and the existence of Aswang, vampire-like creatures, is a centuries-long legend throughout the islands

While many use it as a story to tell children, some adorn their homes with garlic bulbs to keep them away

Mysteries, including kidnapped children, and tragedies such as miscarriages, are blamed on Aswang by the superstitious

She said: 'Many of my family - 
including my mum and dad - still live on the island and it has been very
difficult for the last five years after John was accused of being a 
vampire.

'Some people are very ignorant and when my aunt watched a vampire film on TV five years ago she thought it made everything true.

'She
thought John was coming over to Argawanon to suck the blood of the 
villagers and then take it back to Britain to sell to other vampires.

'She read about a lack of blood supplies in the UK and put two and two together and came up with five.'

She
added: 'It is causing a lot of friction in the family and some 
villagers still believe John is a vampire even though the priest has 
told them he is not and that vampires do not exist.

'It is very difficult for everyone, but the village is very superstitious and the rumours will take a long time to go away.'

Last week Mr Teagle and Elsa were 
visited by Father Ely Suico of St Vincent’s Parish in Bogo City, who had
defended them during the uproar in Argawanon.

Father Suico said: 'In the Philippines there are still a lot of superstitious beliefs and lots of fears about things which cannot be seen.

'Especially now there have been films which have shown vampires, they really believe these must be true.

'I thought I must tell them about these things because it’s very unchristian.'
