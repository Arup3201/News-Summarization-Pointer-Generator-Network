Goalkeeping coach Tony Parks has left Tottenham following the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as the club's new manager.

Pochettino has brought with him goalkeeper coach Toni Jiminez from Southampton as well as assistant manager Jesus Perez and first-team coach Miguel D'Agostino.

And as Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday, Parks was relieved of his duties after meeting with Pochettino at Spurs' Enfield HQ.

Decision maker: Mauricio Pochettino is likely to bring his staff with him from Southampton after being named Tottenham boss

'We would like to thank him for his contribution and achievements,' read a statement of Spurs' official website. 'We wish Tony every success for the future and he will always be welcome at the Lane.'

The futures of coaches Chris Ramsey, Steffen Freund and Les Ferdinand's are all unclear after the sacking of Tim Sherwood and subsequent appointment of Pochettino.

It is understood that Pochettino will take a short holiday next week before returning to England ahead of his official unveiling as Sherwood's successor.
