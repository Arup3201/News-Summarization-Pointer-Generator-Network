A notorious rapist walking the streets of Britain has been granted anonymity by a judge as he uses human rights laws to dictate to the authorities where he wants to live.

The violent sex attacker is using Article 8 of the Human Rights Act to demand that he be allowed to move from England, where he committed his crime, to another part of the UK.

But even before the case has been heard, a judge has thrown a cloak of secrecy over proceedings following an application by his lawyers.

Anonymous: The rapist has been granted anonymity by the courts before proceedings start

They have obtained a strict court order banning the Press from telling the public who he is, or giving any detail which might identify him.

The man, whose identity is known to the Daily Mail, raped a woman after breaking into her house armed with a knife.

He was sentenced to more than a decade behind bars but released after serving half his sentence. Like other prisoners ‘on licence’ he must remain in a particular place and report to the Probation Service.

He applied to the Ministry of Justice to be allowed to move from England to another part of the UK, where he is originally from and where his family now live.

When the authorities refused, he launched a legal appeal under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, the right to a private and family life. His case is thought to be funded by legal aid.

Judges have granted the convicted sex offender anonymity following an application by his lawyers

A full hearing in the case will take place this week. A court order made by High Court judge Mr Justice Underhill said nothing should be printed which could reveal who he is and what he did.

The judge did not make clear his reasons for imposing the order, other than to note a claim by the rapist’s lawyer that naming him would have an impact on his family. He said: ‘I do … accept that, given the apparent particular Press interest in the case, the issue of anonymisation is best determined in advance of the substantive hearing. I have directed accordingly.

‘I have provided for preliminary anonymisation but it must be understood that that may not be continued at or after the hearing.’

Tory MP Priti Patel called for a review to ensure anonymity is not given too easily to ‘such despicable individuals’.

She said: ‘The first point to make is that clearly secret justice in this case is showing utter disregard for the victim of this appalling crime. Yet again we are seeing the criminal justice system on the side of the offender and not the victim.’
