It certainly beats another New Years Eve in front of Jools Holland on TV.

A luxury private jet company is offering travellers with a robust budget the chance to celebrate New Years Eve in not just one of the world's most renowned party cities, but two. In the same night. 

For a mere £7,380 per person, or £132,838, based on 18 passengers, party fiends can enjoy a full evening's celebrations in Sydney, and then, stamina dependent, do it all over again in Los Angeles, by travelling in the world's fastest private jet.

If Sydney Harbour's spectacular firework display is not enough for you, why not hop on a private jet to LA?

PrivateFly, the company offering this splendiferous trip, say the feat is only possible  by moving eastwards across the International Date Line. 

With the time in Los Angeles 19 hours behind Sydney, you can visit both in the same evening - by minimising travel time and flying on their cleverly planned itinerary, says the private jet booking service. 

Flight time between the two cities in the Gulfstream G650 is now just under 11 hours, so with the 19-hour time difference, you can gain eight hours of party time by flying eastwards.

6:00pm, December 31, 2014, Los Angeles: Party all over again 

Carol Cork, marketing director of PrivateFly, comments: 'This is the ultimate in luxury ways to see in 2015, in two of the world's most exciting party cities.  

'This unique flight experience is only possible by private jet, as the timings are so tight – and there are no airline schedules to fit the itinerary.

'With the world rotating at 1,038 miles per hour, no civilian aircraft can currently overtake time. 

Guests can continue celebrations on board with music and video entertainment, bubbly and bespoke catering

'But the Gulfstream G650 is the world's fastest and furthest private jet, with a range of 7,000 nm and a top speed of Mach 0.925, just under the speed of sound. 

'Supersonic private jets are currently at concept stage, and expected to be in operation by 2021. So that will allow even more extended hours of partying within the next few years.'

The itinerary begins in Sydney at the city's most exclusive party spots. Options include joining other VIP revellers at the NYE Midnight Party at the Sydney Opera House. 

Or couples travelling alone may prefer to cosy up in The Dining Room at the Park Hyatt Sydney where they'll get sweeping views of the harbour and the dazzling annual firework display.

Speedy: Flight time between Sydney and Los Angeles in the Gulfstream G650 is just under 11 hours

Guests can hit some of Hollywood's hottest nightspots, including the Cleopatra's Ball at the Egyptian Theatre

Guests can party until past 1am as Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport is a short drive away and offers 24-hour access for private jets. 

On board the aircraft, which departs Australia at 2am, passengers can continue the celebrations VIP style with music and video entertainment, fine wines, champagne and bespoke catering.

For those who need a disco nap, there's the option of a double bed and bathroom with shower, as well as fully-reclining seats.  

While others are waking to a New Year and sore heads back in Sydney, the night is yet young in LA. Revellers land at Van Nuys airport, in LA at 6pm.

The glitziest nightspots of Beverley Hills are nearby. Each year, the Cleopatra's Ball attracts some of Hollywood's A-list to the Egyptian Theatre.

Or guests can dine at one of LA's swankiest restaurants, such as the Crustacean, famed for its South East Asian cuisine and floor-to-ceiling aquarium.
