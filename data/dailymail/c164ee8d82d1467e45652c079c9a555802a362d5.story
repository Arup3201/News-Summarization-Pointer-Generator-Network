Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is celebrating the birth of his seventh child after his girlfriend Dasha Zhukova gave birth a daughter called Leah Lou in New York.

The little girl was born in Manhattan after the Chelsea owner, 46, kept his $1.5 billion yacht moored on the West Side docks for the past two months.

Stunning brunette Dasha - real name Daria - gave birth to Leah at the city's Presbyterian hospital.The couple's son Aaron Alexander, now three, was born in Los Angeles.

Leah's US birth, confirmed by a source close to Abromovich to MailOnline today, means that she automatically qualifies as an American citizen. Her mother already has a US passport after growing up in Los Angeles.

Abramovich's 557-foot yacht named Eclipse, which has lost the title of world's largest private yacht to a newly-launched yacht named Azzam measuring 590-foot, has been anchored in New York harbour for the past two months

A source said Abromovich and Dasha did not plan the birth in the States with this intention, clarifying that Dasha wanted her children to be born in the US, where she lived as a child and attended university, adding: 'Dasha grew up in the US. The baby could have been born anywhere in the world and still had US citizenship.'

Abramovich
 already has five children with his ex-wife Irina Vyacheslavovna 
Malandina.

RIA Novosti broke the news and a source said that Abromovich had been by Dasha's side, reporting that Leah was born last Monday, adding:  'Mother and daughter are doing fine. Roman is, of course, delighted.'

Socialite Dasha gave birth at NY Presbyterian.Dasha is now thought to have checked out of the hospital and the Eclipse is said to be leaving New York this week.

Women who deliver at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia have their babies in the Sloane Hospital for Women, where 'Labor and delivery rooms are spacious, newly renovated, and flooded with natural light, many with views of the Hudson River.

'Each room includes a sleeper couch for a significant other, and plenty of room for members of the healthcare team.'

Abramovich has five children - Arkadiy, Anna, Sofia, Arina and Ilya - with his second wife Irina, to whom he was married between 1991 and 2007.

The eldest, Arkady, 19, is already following in his father's footsteps, having executed his first oil deal worth £30.6 million last month.

The 590-foot super-yacht, worth $1.5bn and seen here in New York, was recently robbed of the 'world's largest private yacht' title by a newly-launched yacht named Azzam measuring 590-foot

Russian billionaire Abramovich's super-yacht Eclipse has been moored in New York for the past two months, and it has just been revealed that his girlfriend Daria Zhukova gave birth to his seventh child, Leah Lou, last Monday

Speculation was rife when the 
twice-married oligarch docked his 557ft private yacht Eclipse in New 
York in February, much to the astonishment of New Yorkers - at a cost of
 $2,000-a-day.

Until recently the largest yacht in the world, Eclipse was unlikely to go unnoticed as it arrived in the Big Apple.

The incredible vessel boasts two 
swimming pools, two helicopter pads, a movie theater, a jacuzzi as well 
as a disco, around 30 cabins, a mini-submarine, and even a missile 
defence system.

It also has armour-plating around 
Abramovich’s master suite, bullet-proof windows and a laser system 
designed to dazzle long-lens photographers.

When it was ordered the initial cost 
was estimated at around $500million, but by the time Abramovich took 
delivery last year it was spiralling towards the $1.5billion mark 
because of the extra luxury fittings and security measures

Eclipse was built by the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, and delivered to Abramovich last December.

The oligarch also owns three other mega-yachts, the Pelorus (377ft), the Ecstasea (282ft) and the Sussurro (161ft).

Annual running costs for his fleet are around $25million including full tanks of petrol at around $110,000 per yacht.

Until recently the Eclipse was recognised as the largest private yacht in the world. But it was robbed of its title recently by new super-yacht, commissioned by a mystery billionaire.

The colossal 590ft Azzam is the length of two football fields and cost US$609m. It hit the water for the first time last week from a shipyard in Bremen, Germany,fter fours years of construction by the Lurssen Yachts company.

Expensive: The yacht's initial estimated cost was around $500million, but by the time Mr Abramovich took delivery last year it was spiraling towards the $1.5billion

Best of the fleet:  Abramovich also owns three other mega-yachts, the Pelorus (377ft), the Ecstasea (282ft) and the Sussurro (161ft)

Too big: Eclipse lies at anchor in Antibes' bay, southeastern France, where it was not denied space to dock in 2011

The person who commissioned the 
project is still a secret, but reports speculate that the owner is 
member of the Saudi royal family.

It can travel at 30 knots (34.5mph) and the interior has been decked out in the ultimate of luxury.

'She represents another milestone in yachting history,' said Lurssen Managing Partner Peter Lurssen.

Abramovich met the daughter of Russian oligarch Alexander Zhukova at a New Year's Eve party hosted by her father in 2006.

But apparently romance did not blossom between the two until he had split from second wife Irina after 16-years of marriage.

Their divorce ended in a record settlement rumoured to be £1.5billion made by Abramovich to the mother of his five children, who now lives on an £18million West Sussex estate.

Dasha was photographed showing off her baby bump on the Caribbean island of St Barts in January.

The former model grew up in the US and she gave birth to son Aaron in Los Angeles, where she was raised.

Dasha now heads the Iris Foundation, which funds a culture centre in Moscow, edits a magazine and is boss of a fashion label.

Abramovich reportedly boosted his army of security staff to 40 people in 2007 – making him one of the best-protected businessmen in the world.

The latest addition to his clan came just weeks after the death of Russian billionaire rival Boris Berezovsky, 67, who sued him for £3.7billion last year and lost.
