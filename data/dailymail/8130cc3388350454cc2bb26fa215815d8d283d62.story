A gipsy accused of abducting a mystery blonde girl in Greece tried to blame his wife for taking her in yesterday, calling the child a ‘bomb’ who he never wanted.

Hristos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, appeared in court to be formally charged with child abduction and forging documents.

For several years, they posed as parents to a blue-eyed girl known as Maria, seemingly to make money from her begging.

Bought: Neighbours suggested the couple could have purchased the child for just £850

Neighbours yesterday suggested the pair could have purchased the child for as little as £850.

Her case has attracted global attention, with thousands of calls from people who believe they may know her identity.

The child – nicknamed ‘the blonde angel’ by the Greek media – was discovered last week when police raided a gipsy camp.

DNA
 evidence proved she was not related to the couple. The defendants 
claimed Maria was four years old, but dental and medical tests suggest 
she is five or six.

They 
insist they did not abduct her, and have appealed unsuccessfully to be 
released on bail so they can trace a Bulgarian woman they say abandoned 
her as a baby.

The pair were interrogated separately by a magistrate in 
Larissa, 30 miles from Tabakou camp, near Farsala, central Greece, where
 the child was found.

The 
couple – who are using different lawyers since their apparent falling 
out – offered guilty pleas on lesser charges of illegal adoption, which 
were rejected by the city’s prosecutor.

Abducting a child under the age of 14 carries a maximum sentence of ten years.

The forgery charges relate to fake child birth certificates and two false identities used by Dimopoulou.

The pair were not charged with the far more serious offence of child trafficking due to a lack of evidence.

The
 hearings took place behind closed doors with armed guards, but a source
 inside told the Mail that Salis shifted blame on to his wife.

The
 source said: ‘He said in 2009 he was away from home for a few days when
 he received a phone call from his wife, who said that there was a 
Bulgarian couple at the home who did not want their child.

‘He
 said he did not want a child and said, “I don’t want to put a bomb in 
my house”.’

In a seemingly contradictory statement, Salis has also 
claimed to know the man who ‘mediated’ the handover of the child.

His
 lawyer Constantinos Katsavos said if freed, he could help track the man
 down.

Mr Katsavos added: ‘It was an adoption that was not exactly legal
 but took place with the mother’s consent.’

Members of the Roma community protested at the couple’s treatment outside the court.

Haralambos
 Dimitriou, leader of the gipsy camp, said: ‘They accuse the Roma of 
everything – of stealing, of snatching kids. Do these things only happen
 among our race? This is a huge insult for us.’

But
 Mr Dimitriou also suggested the couple paid money for Maria.

He said a 
Bulgarian couple came to the camp in 2009, selling children.

‘They
 had another five children for sale at the time,’ he said.

Mr Dimitriou 
said that he was offered a child for £850 (1,000 euros), but he 
declined.

Nikos Paiteris, 
of the Thessalia region’s Roma association, said: ‘I believe the child 
was given to the family and they may just have given some petty cash... We refuse to accept it is any case of abduction.’

Maria was yesterday said to be in good spirits in the care of Athens charity Smile Of A Child.

In court: Members of the media wait outside a courthouse in the town of Larisa, some 350 km (217 miles) north of Athens where the couple appeared yesterday

Appearance: The Roma couple, arrested on suspicion of abducting a young blonde girl, appeared before a prosecutor in Larissa

Director
 Costas Yannopoulos has said the couple used Maria as a ‘dancing bear’ 
to make money, a view bolstered by two videos of the girl being made to 
dance in public.

Yesterday 
locals said Maria was seen begging in a market two weeks ago. One said 
the distinctive child asked strangers for money both by herself and with
 Dimopoulou.

Smile of a Child has received more than 8,000 calls about Maria.

But six of the eight leads initially described as ‘promising’ have sadly now been ruled out.

The woman accused of abducting Maria has insisted: ‘We did no harm to her. We love her and she loves us.’

Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, who has been arrested with her husband Hristos Salis, told Greek television from her cell: ‘We gave her everything we could, like we do for our other children.’

She admitted Maria was not hers but said she presented her as her own ‘so she could have a proper family environment’.

Salis’s sister Dimitra, 34, told the Daily Mail that Maria had been abandoned by a Bulgarian cotton picker when she was two months old.

At the family’s small stone hut, she said: ‘The woman told us, “Take this baby. If you do not I will just give it to someone else”. She just left and never came back.’

She said they took in the child to protect her, adding: ‘We brought her up well, we loved her.’

Salis’s mother said: ‘The woman who gave birth to her was incapable of looking after her – she did not want her and begged us to take her.’
