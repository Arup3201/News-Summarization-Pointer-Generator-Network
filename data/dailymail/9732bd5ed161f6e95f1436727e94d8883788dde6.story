Gone are the days when a pair of black Copa Mundials were the boot of choice for England players ahead of the World Cup. Today's stars prefer to be noticed on the pitch and it seems the more fluorescent the boot the better.

A whole host of bright colours were seen flashing across the Wembley turf during England's 3-0 friendly win over Peru but Raheem Sterling's footwear particularly caught the eye.

The Liverpool frontman, who replaced Wayne Rooney during the Three Lions' warm-up game on Friday night, was wearing Nike's new Flyknit Mercurial Superfly IV boot - which has a partial sock fitted to it.

The boot, which was unveiled by Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo and will be worn by the Portugal international at next month's World Cup in Brazil, has been billed as a ‘leap forward for on-pitch speed’.

The product, created after four years’ worth of research, will be worn by a host of stars at this summer's tournament.

‘Players like him and Neymar are amazingly detailed in what they come back to us with,’ said Max Blau, Nike’s VP of football footwear, about Ronaldo.

‘They obsess about the details. They take away a boot, try it, and come back with their thoughts.

‘The boot has to be perfect, because if it’s good enough for Neymar and Ronaldo then everyone should be happy.’

This boot, like the Magista, which was released last month just hours after Adidas released their latest offering, has impressed Ronaldo.

‘It makes it a bit more difficult to slip off,’ said the former Manchester United star at April's launch and added that he felt ‘very comfortable and happy' with the boot.

'Nike is always evolving and listen to my feedback,' said Ronaldo.
