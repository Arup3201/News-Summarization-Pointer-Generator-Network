Prince Charles claims the expense poured onto his 15-acre estate is a protest against 'fashionable vandalism'

Prince Charles has admitted that critics may see his organic garden at Highgrove as an 'expensive indulgence', but insisted that it helps to heal 'damaged souls'.

Launching an outspoken attack on the 'short-sighted' destruction of rare plants, fruit and vegetables, he defended the care and money he has lavished on the grounds of his country estate in Gloucestershire.

Since buying Highgrove in 1980, Charles has transformed its once drab gardens by planting unusual British varieties of apples, restoring a wild flower meadow and allowing only natural fertilisers to be used.

He said he saw his efforts as a reaction to the 'carnage of fashionable vandalism' that has left many once common shrubs, trees and farm animals on the endangered list.

Writing in a foreword to a new book about his estate, the 65-year-old Prince said: 'In many ways the garden at Highgrove represents one very small attempt to heal the appallingly short-sighted damage done to the soil, the landscape and to our own souls.

'Some may not like it, others may scoff that it is not in the "real world" or is merely an expensive indulgence.'

Highgrove's 15-acre grounds, which are open to visitors, also feature an 'ego garden' containing busts of Charles, a thatched tree house built for Princes William and Harry, and a 'stumpery' composed of dead trees.

The new book, Highgrove: A Garden 
Celebrated, by Bunny Guinness, which is published next month, reveals 
that the Prince asked his gardeners to cut gaps in the yew hedges so his
 security personnel could take short cuts while protecting him.

The second in line to the throne has been adding rare apple trees and wild meadows to the land since 1980

It is a 'very small attempt' to heal the damage done to our 'soil and souls', the prince writes in a new book. The young princes spent much of the year in the colourful Highgrove meadows with their parents Charles and Diana

Charles, pictured with his mother the Queen in Highgrove garden in 1998, once joked he talked to his plants

Charles famously once admitted that he talked to his plants, although last year he joked that he had changed this practice, telling an interviewer: 'Now I instruct them instead.'

His criticism of trendy fads in gardening has echoes of his trenchant opposition to modern architecture, which he summed up by describing a planned extension to London's National Gallery as a 'monstrous carbuncle'.
