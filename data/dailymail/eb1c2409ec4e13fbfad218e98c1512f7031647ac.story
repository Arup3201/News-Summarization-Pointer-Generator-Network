Speculation that Tiger Woods might play at the Masters next week has spread like wildfire after the 39-year-old played 18 holes at the Augusta National Golf club.  

Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg confirmed to USA TODAY, that his client had flown to the Georgia course where has won four green jackets early on Tuesday morning.  

Steinburg revealed that Woods, who is currently on a self-imposed hiatus from golf to recover from injuries and improve his form, 'will advise in coming days what the plan is.'

Woods has not played on the PGA Tour since withdrawing from the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines on February 5. 

Six days after that event, he announced he was taking a leave of absence from the sport to work on his game and would not return until he felt ready to compete with the world's best players once again.  

He has played just 47 holes on the Tour this season and has recently dropped out of the top 100 in golf's world rankings.
