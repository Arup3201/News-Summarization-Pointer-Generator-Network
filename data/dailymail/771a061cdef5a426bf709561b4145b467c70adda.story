A young couple who threw themselves to their deaths in front of a train had been under pressure to end their relationship, it emerged today.

Davon Smallwood, 25, and Ariana O'Neal, 21, wrote a suicide note saying 'two great people are going to paradise... everything will be good' before jumping from a New York platform on Monday.

Police sources said O'Neal, who has a two-year-old daughter with Smallwood, recently ran away after her mother demanded her boyfriend stay away from the house.

Tragic: Officers place one of the bodies of two people who were killed by a LIRR train at a Queens, New York platform on Monday. The jumpers were a couple who were under pressure to end their relationship

Her landlord Kinsley Senior said Smallwood's recent brushes with the law had become an issue for her mother.

She told the New York Post: 'Her mom didn't want the boyfriend living with all of them. She didnâ€™t like him.'

The
pair, who lived in Queens Village, were arrested earlier this month for
allegedly stealing jewellery from a store in Queens, and both had 
recently dyed their hair red.

A
resident who lives near the station said she often saw O'Neal loitering
around the area and sitting for hours in a urine-soaked stairway by the
platform.

Scene: The couple, Ariana O'Neal and Davon Smallwood, left a suicide note on the platform reading: 'Two great people are going to paradise... everything will be good'. It was found by an MTA officer

Battle: It is believed her mother was against the relationship and had told him to stay away from their house

Terri Simmons said she tried to ask if she was alright on several occasions, but O'Neal never acknowledged her.

The pair were struck by an 80mph train at the Hollis station at 193rd Street and 99th Avenue on Monday. The engineer had seen them but was unable to stop in time, the Post reported.

A witness told how she heard a 'boom' as the bodies hit the train.

The suicide note, much of which was illegible, was found on the platform along with a black garbage bag containing clothes, vodka and a can of Coca-Cola, according to police sources.

An MTA cop who went to the scene read the first page of the notebook and said: 'Oh, my God, it's a suicide note!', witnesses said.

The couple had no IDs, so police had to run fingerprints to establish their names.
