Alex Rodriguez got hit
by a fastball from Boston starter Ryan Dempster in the second inning 
Sunday night, setting off an angry scene at Fenway Park and leading to 
the ejection of New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi.

A-Rod
answered with his bat four innings later by hitting his 649th career 
home run, prompting even more boos and derisive chants.

The
game between the longtime rivals quickly turned testy, with the benches
and bullpens clearing in the second and the teams being warned about 
beanballs by plate umpire Brian O'Nora.

Dink: A-Rod was hit by a pitch in his first trip to Fenway since he was suspended for 211 games over alleged PED use

Target: A-Rod has a target on his back after appealing a 211-game suspension for allegedly using PEDs

Applause: Fenway erupted with applause as the controversial third-baseman for their bitter rival was hit by a pitch

Dempster
appeared to take aim at Rodriguez, recently suspended for 211 games by 
Major League Baseball in the Biogenesis drug case. Rodriguez appealed 
the penalty and can play until there is a final decision.

Booed
when he was on deck at the end of the first inning, Rodriguez was 
jeered when he led off the second. Fans chanted 'You're a cheater!' as 
Dempster threw his first pitch behind Rodriguez's knees.

Dempster
missed inside with the next two pitches and then threw a fastball that 
hit A-Rod's elbow pad and deflected into his back.

O'Nora
immediately issued an emphatic warning to both benches, and a trainer 
escorted Rodriguez to first base. Rodriguez stared at Dempster, but made
no move toward the mound.

Girardi, however, 
ran onto the field and began hollering at O'Nora. Presumably in 
disbelief that Dempster hadn't been ejected, a livid Girardi wildly 
swung his fist - and it came near O'Nora's chin.

'He
was trying to establish his fastball,' Red Sox manager John Farrell 
said during an in-game interview on ESPN. 'Obviously, the pitch got away
from him.'

Vigilante Justice: Red Sox Ryan Dempster seemed to intentionally hit A-Rod with a pitch in Sunday night's game at Fenway Park

'We didn't feel in our dugout it was anything intentional,' he added.

Dempster had hit four batters in 140 innings this season going into the game. He plunked two last year.

Tension
already was high this weekend with the Red Sox leading the AL East and 
the Yankees scrambling for a playoff spot. This dustup at Fenway 
certainly looked familiar - Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez threw down New
York coach Don Zimmer during a wild brawl in the 2003 AL championship 
series, and Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek pushed Rodriguez in the face 
during a 2004 scuffle.

But this confrontation came with a decided twist: Along with the Red Sox, Rodriguez has been at odds with the Yankees, too.

Yankees
management has been feuding with Rodriguez and his legal team, with the
club still owing him more than $80 million through 2017.

Heated: Yankee Manager Joe Girardi sticks up for A-Rod, whom he feels was intentionally plugged by Dempster

The Boot: Girardi was ultimately tossed from the game after a screaming match with umpire Brian O'Nora

'It's
hard to engage someone when this stuff is going on,' general manager 
Brian Cashman said hours before Sunday's game, explaining why he and 
Rodriguez don't talk much anymore.

Other major
leaguers also have spoken out, criticizing players penalized for using 
performance-enhancing drugs for the damage they've done to baseball. 
Boston pitcher John Lackey recently said he had a problem with Rodriguez
being allowed to play while his suspension is under appeal.

Cashman
specifically took issue with Rodriguez and his new lawyer, defending 
the team's medical treatment of the star third baseman during last 
year's playoffs.

Over the weekend, lawyer 
Joseph Tacopina told The New York Times that the Yankees tried to make 
Rodriguez look bad, claiming they used him in the playoffs while he was 
hurt. The three-time AL MVP went 3 for 25 with 12 strikeouts in the 2012
postseason.

'I know that our medical staff 
did everything they possibly can to assist Alex, help Alex, diagnose 
Alex and give him the best proper medical care,' Cashman said.

Cashman
said Rodriguez never complained of any problem during the playoffs 
until Girardi pulled him for a pinch-hitter in a key spot.

This weekend, Rodriguez said: 'I shouldn't have been out there last year.'

Cashman disputed that stance. He didn't like how the message was delivered, either.

'Did he ever say he didn't feel right? He never said it,' the GM said.

'You
see the attorney say what he said and Alex is talking to you guys after
the game and it seems like when I'm reading the comments, it's like, "I
can't really comment." It's as if he doesn't know anything about it, 
which we all know he really does,' Cashman said.

Sidelined
by a hip injury and quadriceps problem, the 38-year-old Rodriguez made 
his season debut Aug. 5 on the same day MLB handed down his suspension.

Rodriguez
was hitting .279 with one homer and four RBIs going into Sunday's game.
After being hit by a pitch, he drove in a run with groundout in his 
next at-bat.

In the sixth, Rodriguez hit a 
leadoff drive to straightaway center field against Dempster and let out a
scream as he rounded both first base and third. The three-time MVP 
clapped his hands as he stepped on home plate and pointed to sky.

The
home run trimmed the Yankees' deficit to 6-4, and they went ahead later
in the inning when Brett Gardner hit a bases-loaded triple.

Rodriguez's second homer since coming off the disabled list left him 11 behind Willie Mays for fourth place on the career list.
