A jury which convicted a homeless woman of second-degree murder in 
the death of a woman pushed off a Los Angeles train platform heard 
expert opinions Wednesday on whether the defendant was sane at the time 
of the crime.

But the panel went home for the evening without reaching a verdict in
the sanity phase of Jackkqueline Pogue's trial. Jurors were to resume 
deliberations Thursday.

Pogue was found guilty late Tuesday in the death of 
84-year-old Betty Sugiyama, who was pushed onto train tracks, struck her
head and never regained consciousness.

Two experts, one for the prosecution and one for the defense, 
testified about Pogue's life and said she had been plagued by mental 
illness since she was 15.

But the prosecution expert, Dr. Mark Jaffe, said Pogue was mentally ill but not insane.

"She does have a severe mental illness," he said. "She was hearing 
voices and having delusions. I believe she has schizoid affective 
disorder."

He said that was not sufficient to meet the criteria for declaring her legally insane.

Victim: Betty Sugiyama was pushed onto train tracks by Jackkqueline Pogue

The defense expert, Camy Kingston, a neuropsychologist, said that 
Pogue was insane at the time she pushed Sugiyama off the train platform.

She said the defendant was also mentally disabled and had been shuttled among mental care facilities throughout her life.

Pogue's
lawyer said during the trial that she was an unmedicated schizophrenic 
who had been released from a hospital three days before the incident.

Witnesses said Sugiyama was walking with her sister when Pogue, 46, 
lunged at her and pushed her off the commuter rail platform onto the 
tracks.

An earlier jury deadlocked in a separate trial, uncertain if Pogue 
acted deliberately and understood the consequences of her actions.

Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen assured jurors that if they find 
Pogue not guilty by reason of insanity, she will be placed in a mental 
health facility. He said she could be kept there for the duration of her
sentence on the murder conviction.
