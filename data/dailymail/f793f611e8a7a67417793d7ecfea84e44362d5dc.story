Denied: Leslie Van Houten was denied parole for the 20th time 44 years after going to prison for the LaBianca murders

A parole panel refused an emotional bid by former Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten to release her from prison 44 years after she participated in a notorious set of murders.

The denial came at the 63-year-old's 20th parole hearing on Wednesday, where the panel heard from relatives of the victims who were opposed to her release.

Board of Parole Hearings Commissioner Jeffrey Ferguson told Van Houten she had failed to explain how someone as intelligent and well-bred as she was could have committed the 'cruel and atrocious' murders of Leno and Rosemary La Bianca. She won't be eligible to ask for parole again for five years, but Ferguson said she could request another hearing sooner if circumstances change.

'The crimes will always be a factor,' he said. 'The question is whether the good will ever outweigh the bad. It certainly didn't today.'

Van Houten was convicted of murder and conspiracy for her role in the slayings of wealthy Los Angeles grocers Leno and Rosemary La Bianca. They were stabbed to death in August 1969, one night after Manson's followers killed actress Sharon Tate and four others. Van Houten was 19 at the time.

Van Houten did not participate in the Tate killings but went along the next night when the La Biancas were slain in their home. During the penalty phase of her trial she confessed to joining in stabbing Mrs. La Bianca after she was dead.

'I know I did something that is unforgiveable, but I can create a world where I make amends,' Van Houten said before the decision.

With survivors of the LaBiancas sitting behind her at the California Institution for Women, Van Houten acknowledged participating in the killings ordered by Manson.

'He could never have done what he did without people like me,' said Van Houten, who has been in custody for 44 years.

'She is living a life of amends for her crime on a daily basis,' Van Houten's attorney Michael Satris said before the hearing. 'Everything she does now is to be of service and benefit to the world.'

Satris added Van Houten's value system is the complete opposite of 1969 when 'she was following the teachings of a false prophet.'

Van Houten has been commended for her work helping elderly women inmates at the prison where she and other followers of Manson women have been incarcerated. She earned two college degrees while in custody.

Other members of Manson's murderous 'family' have lost multiple bids for parole.

One former Manson follower, Bruce Davis, was approved for parole last year only to have California's governor Jerry Brown veto the plan in March. She was portrayed by her defense lawyers as the youngest and least culpable of those convicted with Manson, a young woman from a good family who had been a homecoming princess and showed promise until she became involved with drugs and was recruited into Manson's murderous cult.

Van Houten was convicted along with Manson, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkle - they were all sentenced to death, but their sentences were reduced to life in prison when the death penalty was briefly outlawed in the 1970s.

Atkins died of cancer in prison. Krenwinkle has been denied parole repeatedly and Manson, now 78, has stopped coming to parole hearings, saying that prison is his home and he wants to stay there.

Manson's lieutenant, Charles 'Tex' Watson, was convicted separately and has been denied parole many times.

Decades ago, one of the original prosecutors in the case, Stephen Kay, said there would come a time when Van Houten would be ready for parole.

But parole officials, while giving her high marks for her accomplishments in prison, have now refused her bids for freedom 20 times. Her last hearing was in 2010 at which she said, 'I apologize for the pain I caused.'
