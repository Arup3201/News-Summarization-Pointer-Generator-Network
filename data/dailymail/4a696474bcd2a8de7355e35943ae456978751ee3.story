A dilapidated Victorian lighthouse has been returned to its former glory following a £1.35million restoration project.

Battered by waves and storms for more than a century, Roker Lighthouse, which stands at the entrance to Sunderland Harbour, Tyne and Wear, had begun to show its age.

Both its interior and exterior were in a state of disrepair, while the once powerful light needed replacing.

Restoration: Roker Lighthouse, which stands at the entrance to Sunderland Harbour, is undergoing a £1.3million renovation project to bring the crumbling structure back to its former glory

In need of work: Many of the 110-year-old lighthouse's internal rooms, pictured, had fallen into disrepair

Rough around the edges: The money, put aside by Sunderland City Council, has been used to repair some of the Grade II listed building's interior, pictured

Paint on the structure’s 138ft exterior was also peeling.

But after Sunderland City Council put aside £1.35million for the restoration, it is now slowly returning back to its former splendour.

The grade II listed building has been sandblasted, painted and polished.

Its light has been replaced by a £200,000 LED, while work is planned to resurface the deck of the adjoining pier.

A gilded 1.6-metre weather vane, which has been daubed in gold-leaf, will be the lighthouse's crowning glory.

Powerful: The building's light - which used to run off gas - has now been replaced by a £200,000 LED, pictured

Bright: The new light, pictured, replaces the former beacon - which could be seen 15 miles out to sea

A team of workers from contractors Trac had to battle winds and waves as high as 20ft to carry out the renovations.

Site manager Ian Buchanan said: 'We are still on schedule to finish on time.

'The work we have been doing has been confined to the lantern house because it has been in disrepair for about 40 years.

'You could poke your fingers through holes in the metal walls to the outside because of rot.

'Now, there is new metal and new glass in there, and a new lantern is to be installed.'

Former glory: Many of the landmark's original features have been repainted, left, and a 1.6-metre gilded weather vane, right, will now crown the lighthouse

Back in time: A historical photograph, from circa 1885, shows the granite blocks used to construct the lighthouse being put in to place by a crane

Building blocks: A crowd gathers on the Roker Lighthouse pier to watch workers construct the iconic building

The landmark was the brainchild of Henry Hay Wake, chief engineer of the 
River Wear Commissioners.

Constructed between 1885 and 1903, the lighthouse and pier were hailed at the time as a triumph of engineering.

It was constructed from 45-ton blocks made from concrete plus grey and red Aberdeen granite.

Concrete was poured into huge wooden moulds on shore, before the blocks were installed in to place by a crane - which some sources say was called 'Goliath'

Heavy duty: A huge crane, named in some historical sources as 'Goliath', pictured, was used to ease the 45-ton blocks into place

'A triumph': This picture shows the opening of the lighthouse - which was described as a 'triumph of engineering' when it was completed in 1903

The original lantern was gas powered and would emit a 45,000 candlepower reflected beam - visible for over 15 miles out to sea.

By the end of the 19th century Sunderland Harbour was one of the busiest industrial ports in the country, with 15,000 tons of coal transported through it every day.

The lighthouse would have been a welcome sign to hundred of crews coming into the port.

Work on the lighthouse begun at the end of July 2013 and the first phase of renovations were completed on Monday.

Importance: Sunderland Harbour, where the lighthouse stands, was one of the busiest ports in the country in the 19th century with 15,000 tons of coal transported through it every day

Proud moment: One phase of the restoration, which started in July this year, was completed on Monday
