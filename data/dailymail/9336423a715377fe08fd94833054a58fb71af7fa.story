Former American Idol star Clay Aiken took to the polls in his home state of North Carolina on Tuesday morning as he battled it out to win his local congressional seat in the midterm elections.

In the end however, Aiken, the one-time special education teacher who finished a narrow runner-up  in the 2003 Idol final, lost his challenge to 2nd Congressional District incumbent Republican Renee Ellmers.

The Democratic candidate's day got off to a bad start, as after he cast his vote at Mills Park Elementary School in Cary just before 9 a.m. his tour bus stalled.

Authorities in Cary had to assist Aiken's bus - emblazoned with the slogan ‘Clay for North Carolina’ on the side - after it came to a shuddering halt just up the road from the polling station.

Aiken, 35, and his team were hoping the mechanical malfunction wasn’t a bad omen in a race in which he wass very much the underdog after Republicans redrew the congressional map in 2011 - shifting the district's demographics to the right - but in the end Aiken could not emerge victorious.

Since becoming a national TV sensation 11 years ago, Aiken has enjoyed stints on Broadway in Monty Python's Spamalot and on television in The Celebrity Apprentice. 

He also made the cover of People magazine when he announced in 2008 that he was gay.

On the campaign trail, Aiken has also managed to cause quite a stir in his first attempt at running for political office.

The Democratic candidate, who was challenging 2nd Congressional District incumbent Republican Renee Ellmers, cast his vote at Mills Park Elementary School in Cary just before 9 a.m.

Aiken received almost 12 million votes nationwide while narrowly losing to Idol winner Ruben Studdard in 2003

'I can get people to pay attention,' said Aiken at a town hall campaign event last month. 'It's a benefit of where I came from and how I got here.'

While national Democratic groups haven't arrived with financial support, Aiken believes there's a path to victory in the U-shaped district.

He had been trying to attract independent and Republican voters who recall his appearances as a crooner, and been hoping to catch breaks on the waves of unhappiness with Republican state government and gridlocked Washington politics.

'People are very dissatisfied with congress in general and getting absolutely nothing done,' said Aiken. 

He had accused Ellmers, a nurse, of being wrongly fixated on repealing President Obama's signature health care law, rather than fixing its problems. 

'If after three or four years, you still haven't gotten anything done, then what are you getting paid for?'

Ellmers, who like Aiken was a first-time candidate four years ago when she upset Democratic Rep. Bob Etheridge, had thrown his political inexperience back at Aiken and suggested he's role-playing to win votes.

'He's an entertainer. He's an actor,' Ellmers, 50, said. 'He believes that he can change costume and get into character and speak to whichever group and win them over.'

Ellmers was a favorite in the district, anchored by Fort Bragg, affluent suburbs west of Raleigh, retirees near the famous Pinehurst golf resort and solid red south of Greensboro.

The 2011 redistricting made the district swing more Republican, as Mitt Romney received nearly 58 percent of the 2012 presidential vote there, according to an analysis by the business advocacy group the North Carolina Chamber. 

Aiken raised more than $1 million for his campaign since February, benefiting from Broadway and Los Angeles events along the way. 

Ellmers, who has raised more than $1.8 million this cycle, is battling anti-incumbent sentiment.

Aiken has tried to distance himself from Obama, saying he disagrees with him on issues and believes several changes should be made to the president's signature health care law.

Aiken had 'presented himself as a very credible candidate and I think some people wondered whether that would be the case,' said Scott Falmlen, a longtime Democratic political consultant in Raleigh, who isn't working with Aiken.

'He comes across as knowledgeable of the issues.'

But during their lone televised debate, Ellmers contended that, in the end, 'you support Obamacare.'

Aiken is a gay man running in a largely conservative district. Among passers-by in Erwin, it wasn't an issue. 'That's his choice, that's his life. It doesn't affect me at all,' said Susan Boggs, 38, of Erwin.

Aiken supports gay marriage while Ellmers does not, though she publicly opposed the 2012 constitutional amendment in North Carolina that banned gay marriage. 

Both said during their debate that the issue of same-sex marriage, which is being decided in federal courts across the country, is out of their hands.

Aiken received almost 12 million votes nationwide while narrowly losing to Idol winner Ruben Studdard in 2003. This year, he edged out a well-known local businessman in the Democratic primary. 

It may take the ardent support of local Claymates - Aiken's fan base during his Idol run - to win the title of congressman.
