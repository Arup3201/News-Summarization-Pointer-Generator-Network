Former Labour ministers could face police questioning over Britain’s alleged role in the rendition of terror suspects into the hands of Colonel Gaddafi.

Scotland Yard yesterday opened an investigation into claims MI6 officers were involved in illegally transferring the men to Libya where they were jailed and tortured.

It is thought likely that former foreign secretary Jack Straw will be asked whether he or other ministers approved actions by agents of the Secret Intelligence Service.

The investigation will further delay the long-awaited inquiry by Sir Peter Gibson into all allegations of British complicity in torture during the War on Terror.

Last night Whitehall sources suggested it could mean the inquiry being put on hold indefinitely while the police investigate.

As police announced the probe yesterday, the Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer confirmed no MI5 or MI6 officer will face charges over two separate, long-running investigations into complicity in torture.

The complaint against the Security Service came from Binyam Mohamed, who said MI5 knew he was being mistreated when it handed over questions to his U.S. captors.

Police found MI5 did pass information to the U.S. but said there was ‘insufficient evidence’ to prove any officer knew Mohamed was being tortured at the time.

Prosecutors also concluded there was not enough evidence to prosecute an MI6 officer for aiding and abetting torture over an incident at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan in January 2002 when he interviewed a detainee.

British Foreign Minister William Hague says the Government is committed to 'drawing a line' under claims of intelligence agency involvement in the torture of terrorist suspects held overseas

Investigators were unable to find the victim or any eye-witnesses and said there was ‘no realistic prospect’ of conviction.

The latest rendition claims first emerged last year in secret documents found in the former headquarters of Gaddafi’s intelligence chief Musa Kusa.

In one, former senior SIS officer Sir Mark Allen appeared to try to take credit for handing over intelligence which enabled the U.S. to capture a terror suspect Abdel Hakim Belhadj.

Belhadj is a senior military figure 
in the new Libyan government and is suing Britain over his torture at 
the hands of Gaddafi’s henchmen.

A
CIA document found at the same time suggested Britain had launched its 
own operation to transfer another man, Abu Munthir, from Hong Kong to 
Tripoli.

At the time the revelations emerged, security sources suggested
the operations were authorised at ‘Secretary of State’ level.

Solicitors
Leigh Day & Co, who represent both men, said: ‘Our clients and 
their families’ lives have been irreversibly affected by the crimes 
committed against them by the Gaddafi regime.’
