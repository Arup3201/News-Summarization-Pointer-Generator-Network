A secret letter which documents a
private meeting between King George V urging his Foreign Secretary Edward Grey to
go to war with Germany two days before the outbreak of the First World War has been unearthed.

The incredible note, sent during
one of the most difficult times in British history has been made public for the first time, by Adrian Graves, Sir
Edward’s great-great-nephew and grandson of Sir Cecil Graves.

King George V, who had stayed
away from making public declarations about Europe as his hands were tied as a constitutional monarch, said it
was ‘absolutely essential’ Britain go to war in order to prevent Germany from
achieving ‘complete domination of this country’.

However when his Foreign
Secretary Sir Edward said that the cabinet hadn’t found a justifiable reason to
enter the conflict, the King replied: ‘You have got to find a reason, Grey.’

Adrian Graves inherited Sir
Cecil’s papers which he kept in their original Asprey case next to his fishing tackle but had never looked at them.

He told The Telegraph: ‘My
grandfather was involved in the First World War – he was one of the first to be
captured, at the Battle of Mons, and later awarded the Military Cross. The case
contained some of his records and papers relating to the war and his captivity.

‘I decided to look through
through them as the centenary of August 4 was coming up, and I came across an
envelope. Written on the front were the words, ‘Interview with King’. I had
never known it was there,’

But they held a treasure-trove of
information.

In a letter written by Sir Cecil, Sir Edward’s nephew, he details a meeting that took place between him and the King, who summoned him to Buckingham Palace a month after his uncle’s death
in 1933.

The letter told how King George V offered his condolences then recalled the events
of 1914 to Sir Cecil.

Sir Cecil wrote: 'He told me of
the interview he had with Uncle Edward two days before the outbreak of war. It
lasted for one and a half hours.

‘He told me that Uncle Edward had
said that he could not possibly see what justifiable reason we could find for
going to war.

HM said in reply, ‘You have got
to find a reason, Grey.’

The incredible meeting between the King and his Foreign Secretary is not
recorded in any history book.

Edward Grey, was a British Liberal statesman.

He was also the first Viscount Grey of Fallodon.

He served as Foreign Secretary from 1905 to 1916, which was the longest continuous tenure of any person in that office. He is probably best remembered for his remark at the outbreak of war: 'The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our time'.

But it shows the importance placed on
defeating Germany's plans.

Sir Cecil also revealed that a
private letter from Raymond Poincaré, the French President, encouraging Britain to go to
war and a telegram from King Albert about
Belgium was also sent from the King to Sir Edward.

On August 3, Sir Edward gave a
speech to Parliament over Europe’s instability.

He returned to his room in the
Foreign Office and made the now famous remark as he watched the lamps being lit
outside: 'The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit
again in our lifetime.'

By August 4th, Britain was at
war.
