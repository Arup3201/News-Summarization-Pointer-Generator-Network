Repeated exposure of children to secondhand smoke is child abuse, a leading doctor has warned.

Adam Goldstein, a professor in family medicine, says exposure is as abusive as leaving children unattended in hot car, or drink driving.

He claims he was forced to speak out after caring for 'too many children hospitalised with asthma and pneumonia, caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke'.

Adam Goldstein, a professor in family medicine, says exposing children to secondhand smoke is 'as abusive as leaving them unattended in hot car, or drink driving'

His controversial opinion piece has been published in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine.

In it, he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse.

'But what if the substance is secondhand smoke?,' he asks. 

Dr Goldstein, who is director of the tobacco intervention programs in the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, says the damage from smoke is 'as abusive as many other commonly accepted physical and emotional traumas of children'.

His comments come after years of caring for children who have suffered severe respiratory illness due to secondhand smoke exposure.

In the opinion piece, he writes: 'Scientific research over the last decade has increasingly demonstrated that exposure to secondhand smoke is not simply a nuisance; it is deadly.

'Secondhand smoke exposure causes multiple diseases in children, including asthma and pneumonia, and results in thousands of avoidable hospitalisations.

'It is a major cause of sudden infant death syndrome and may cause lung cancer and heart attacks with repeated exposure.

He argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse

'No safe level of exposure exists.

'[Therefore], purposefully and recurrently exposing children to secondhand smoke - a known human carcinogen - despite repeated warnings, is child abuse.' 

In the paper, he goes on to explain how he and his colleagues treated two children of smokers 'at least 10 times over three years'.

Despite repeated attempts to get the parents to quit, they continued to smoke - and the children, aged 5 and 7, repeatedly visited the clinic with ear infections, coughing, bronchitis, and asthma.

In the end, the younger child developed pneumonia, he says. 

After treating her with antibiotics and inhalers,' Dr Goldstein and his colleagues implored the parents to stop smoking - or at least avoid smoking anywhere near the children - and offered them counselling.

'The parents, however, refused to engage with us about quitting smoking, pharmacotherapy for cessation, or about not letting their children be exposed to cigarette smoke,' he says. 

Shortly after, the child appeared in the emergency room with a recurrence of pneumonia and severe asthma. 

'By the time we heard about it, she was already on a ventilator in the pediatric intensive care unit, where she stayed for several days before ultimately improving. 

'Out of the 10 adults gathered in the waiting room - parents, extended family members, and several friends - six were heavy smokers,' he writes. 

'In retrospect, it is easier to see where and why we failed: our patient was suffering from child abuse, and we had failed to intervene beyond offering medication, counseling, and referral.' 

As a result, Dr Goldstein says it is time for society - including doctors - to do much more.

Dr Goldstein claims he was forced to speak out after caring for 'too many children hospitalized with asthma and pneumonia, caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke'.

'We must intervene to stop this abuse,' he writes.  

Options he suggests include counselling of parents that smoke, legislation, and even taking children away from their parents. 

The key message, he says, is that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke.

He points out that some U.S. states, including Texas, Vermont and Washington - already prohibit foster parents from smoking around children in cars and homes.

'If this is true for foster families and smoking, shouldn't it be the case for all parents?,' he asks.

Additional legal protection for young children exposed to secondhand smoke makes common 'sense'.

He adds that children already suffering from chronic lung illnesses should be protected from ongoing exposure.

'Secondhand smoke exposure decreases lung function and has dozens of carcinogens; yet often the most vulnerable children continue to be exposed, and these children often have no voice.'
