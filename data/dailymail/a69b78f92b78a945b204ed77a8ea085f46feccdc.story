Sporting sunglasses and summer dresses, Britons flocked to the beach to bask in the first signs of spring sunshine as temperatures hit 11C in parts of the UK today.

Elsewhere, volunteers and excited schoolchildren on half-term holiday made the most of the mild weather by taking part in Pancake Day races to mark the start of Lent.

Meanwhile, spring flowers are blooming early as a result of the warmer, less wet winter, with fields of snowdrops in Shaftesbury, Dorset, attracting crowds of visitors.

Clear skies brought a bright and crisp start to the day in southern and eastern areas of England - with a similar start expected for many tomorrow. 

The warm front meant temperatures hovered between 8C and 9C for much of southern England. A high of 11.1C was recorded in Plymouth, Devon, while Exeter reached 10.7C. 

In Brighton, where temperatures reached a high of 8.8C today, sun-seekers were pictured on the shorefront as they enjoyed the warm weather. 

Similar temperatures are expected for the seaside town tomorrow, but those hoping for another day of blue skies may be left disappointed as forecasters expect clouds to gather over the course of the day.

Meanwhile, one brave six-year-old schoolgirl squealed with delight as she ran across the sand at Great Yarmouth Beach, Norfolk, where temperatures hit 8.3C. 

The warmer weather in London brought out the first ice creams of the year. In St James's Park, temperatures reached 9.8C.

Tomorrow morning, clear skies overnight will mean plenty of morning sunshine for southern and eastern England, which will continue to see the best of the weather for much of the day. 

However, the conditions are also likely to bring patches of frost.

Further north, cloud will start to thicken and move further south into the Midlands - pushing the warm front further south. 

Clouds will start to thicken in Wales, north west England, Northern Ireland and north west Scotland and parts of the north will be very blustery - particularly to the east of the Pennines and eastern Scotland.

Despite the cloudy conditions, there will be little rain, with outbreaks expected to remain confined to west Scotland.

More areas of the UK will see temperatures reaching double figures tomorrow. 

The warmest weather is expected in Scotland tomorrow, with forecasters predicting highs between 14C and 15C in the north east of the country - very mild for this time of the year. 

On Wednesday night into Thursday, the wet weather will push into southern England, leaving brighter weather in Scotland and Northern Ireland. But there will be some snow on hills and feel a little colder.

On Friday the weather will be greyer and wetter for much of the UK, but sunnier weather is expected to return in time for the weekend. 

The warmer weather over winter has meant spring flowers are blooming earlier than usual, according to the National Trust. 

Gardeners and volunteers recorded blooms at National Trust properties across the South West, where spring tends to arrive earliest.

They counted 1,345 flowers at 18 gardens in Devon and Cornwall, compared with 1,205 in 2014 – but still far below the record of 3,335 in 2008.

Pancake Day race: Schoolchildren compete at an event in Olney, Buckinghamshire to mark the start of Lent

Camellias have been in bloom in Cornwall since November and the warm weather last week has boosted snowdrops and aconites, the Trust said. 

In Shaftesbury, Dorset, private estates have opened their grounds to visitors as part of the Snowdrop Festival.

Meanwhile, in Olney, Buckinghamshire, schoolchildren and charity fundraisers took part in a pancake race which has been run in the town since 1445 to mark the start of Lent.

Races were also held in Windsor, Berkshire, Leeds and outside the Houses of Parliament, in London. 

Elsewhere in the country another traditional event was taking place to mark the start of Lent: Shrovetide football.

Distinguished by its blood and thunder tackles, mud slides and an enjoyable lack of rules, the game has been held in Alnwick, Northumberland for at least 250 years.

The goals, known as hales, are 440 yards apart and a lack of an offside rule meant there was no debate about players interfering with play.

The pitch, dotted with molehills and reeds, did not lend itself to skilful dribbling, yet there was excitement a-plenty with hearty challenges flying in from players of both sexes and all ages.

Rival parishes St Paul's and St Michael's took each other on, with the latter side winning 2-0. That may have had something to do with them having more than double the number of players.

The game only lasts a maximum of two goals, and umpire David Jackson blew his trumpet to signal the second hale.

After competitors deemed to have played well were handed a shiny £2 coin and the winning goalscorer a crisp £20 note, the ball was hoofed into the adjacent River Aln.

Whoever dives in and carries it out on the other side is allowed to keep the ball. 

Around 500 people cheered on the teams, whose numbers were boosted by a number of visiting American students.
