Police are handing out on-the-spot tickets - for good behaviour.

Officers in south Manchester have started dishing out the tickets to children and teenagers they see behaving well on the neighbourhood's streets. The 'positive tickets' have so far been given out when officers see youths using pedestrian crossings, putting their litter in the bin, riding their bike on the road instead of the pavement or using bike lights at night.

The scheme is currently being trialled around Didsbury and Chorlton - with the aim of encouraging good behaviour among youngsters. So far around 20 tickets have been given out by police officers and PCSOs, with plans to extend it to other areas if successful. It is hoped vouchers for activities like the cinema, or to spend in shops, could be given out if a sponsor for the tickets can be found.

And the scheme has been welcomed. Mario Culpeper, 21, served a year in a young offenders' institute for a violent street robbery and was well-known to police growing up in Chorlton.

Mario, who now lives in Withington, said: 'I used to think badly of the police and think I was always getting picked on by them. I think if they had done something like this scheme when I was younger it might have helped. Hopefully, it will change other peoples' opinions of police." But other teenagers weren't so impressed by the scheme.

Ryan O'Flaherty, 18, from Withington said: 'I have been stopped by the police a couple of times for no reason.

'When they do, you immediately think you've done something wrong and are guilty.

'This idea might make people think about their actions and encourage good behaviour but maybe there are better ways they could do it, like going into schools." Callum Woodworth, 16, from Northern Moor, said: "I don't see the point of this, I think it's a waste of time.

'People should be putting litter in the bin anyway.

'It would be good to get to know your local police better, but maybe in another way.' Sergeant Tariq Butt, who is based at the Elizabeth Slinger Road police station in West Didsbury and who came up with the idea, said: 'As police officers and PCSOs, we only ever issue tickets in negative situations, so this is refreshing not only for ourselves, but also for youngsters who get to see a different side to us.

'When officers first approach people they assume they must have done something wrong, but when we explain the reason for issuing the ticket they are pleasantly surprised and think it's a great idea.

'Then if we see them again they always acknowledge us.

'Handing out these tickets allows us to engage with young people in a really positive way, and so far they have appreciated us stopping to speak to them.

'I believe this scheme will help to reinforce positive behaviour, and I plan to extend it by encouraging local businesses to donate items such as cinema tickets and discount vouchers which can be handed out with the tickets.'
