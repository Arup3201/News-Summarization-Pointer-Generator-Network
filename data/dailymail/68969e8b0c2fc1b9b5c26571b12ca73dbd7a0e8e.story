Ed Miliband pledged to create a fairer Britain if the party was re-elected

Ed Miliband pleaded with voters and his party not to write him off yesterday as he launched a fresh bid to win back credibility on the economy.

The Labour leader insisted he has the ‘inner belief’ to win the next election.

But, in a major admission, he appeared to accept that Labour would not be able to go on spending and will have to promise further cuts if it is to win power in 2015.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls went further, saying Labour ‘can make no commitment to reverse any of the Government’s tax rises or spending cuts’.

With Labour trailing the Coalition in polling on the economy, he admitted: ‘I know, and Ed Miliband does, that Labour’s got a credibility issue.’

But the party’s economic policy was mired in even more confusion last night after Mr Balls blew up in an interview on Sky News when asked why Labour plans to borrow more money than the Coalition.

‘Don’t lecture me on borrowing,’ he said.

Mr Miliband claimed he was prepared to make tough choices to cut the national budget deficit.

But the only concrete measure he offered was to declare that he would not uprate the value of Winter Fuel Allowance in line with inflation.

He then set out a wish-list that would end up costing billions of pounds – including backing a nationwide campaign to substitute a ‘living wage’ of £7.20 an hour for the minimum wage of £6.08.

Mr Miliband said only Labour can deliver fairness when there's less money around and brushed off leadership criticism

The Labour leader admitted welfare 
reforms were necessary but then said he was personally ‘a supporter’ of 
universal benefits, which would make it impossible to cut costs by 
means-testing some state handouts.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Mr 
Miliband flatly rejected the recent verdict of his policy guru Lord 
Glasman, that his leadership had been ‘crap’.

Ed Miliband arrives at the Oxo Tower this morning for the speech with Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeve

‘I don’t agree with him when he says 
it is all crap,’ he said, dismissing the growing chorus of criticism as 
‘noises off’ and internal ructions over his leadership as ‘the 
Kremlinology of politics’.

He insisted: ‘Don’t declare the result
of the race when it is not yet half run. I have a very strong inner 
belief that I will win the race.’

Later, in a speech to the London 
Citizens Organisation, Mr Miliband attempted to flesh out his call for a
crackdown on ‘predator’ companies such as banks, energy companies and 
credit card firms.

He said a Labour government would introduce legislation to ensure that energy firms gave a fair deal to the elderly.

‘To help pensioners, those energy 
companies should be forced by law to guarantee to all those over 75 the 
lowest tariff. It is not fair to those people that they are being ripped
off and overcharged,’ he said.

‘That is a concrete example of how you can make your society fairer in a world where there is less money.’

He also pledged to tax the banks more 
heavily to keep university tuition fees capped at £6,000 a year rather 
than £9,000 as at present.

Chuka Umunna, the party’s business 
spokesman, will make further proposals on curbing executive pay tomorrow
and Mr Balls will make a keynote speech on the economy on Saturday.

But Mr Miliband’s critics refused to 
give him credit for acknowledging economic reality – a full 20 months 
after Labour’s former Treasury chief secretary Liam Byrne left a note 
telling his ministerial successor:

‘There’s no money left.’ Darren 
Murphy, a former special adviser to leading Blairite Alan Milburn, was 
quick to dismiss Mr Miliband’s performance, saying it had ‘more than a 
touch of the Iain Duncan Smith about it’.

Labour’s high command has been at 
pains to dismiss comparisons with Mr Duncan Smith’s doomed leadership of
the Tories as ‘wide of the mark’.

Lord Glasman compounded Mr Miliband’s 
problems. Cornered by a TV crew after the speech, he first said Labour’s
message was clearer. But when asked ‘Really?’ with the camera lowered, 
he shrugged his shoulders and reportedly said ‘No.’

Ed
Miliband flatly rejected the verdict of his former adviser, Lord 
Glasman, that his leadership had been 'crap' during a BBC Radio 4 
programme today

'I don't agree with him when he says it is all c**p,' he said

Tory Party deputy chairman Michael 
Fallon said: ‘If Ed Miliband was serious about taking tough decisions, 
he’d set out a credible plan for cutting the deficit as Alistair 
Darling, Alan Johnson and half the Shadow Cabinet have demanded.

If he seriously accepts there’s less 
money to spend, he would stop making billions of new unfunded spending 
promises and instead tell us what Labour would cut. Instead, Ed Miliband
has given us another relaunch but still no credibility.’

Mr Balls warned the belt-tightening 
would have to go much further. While he said the Government was cutting 
‘recklessly fast’ – choking off economic growth –Labour would still face
‘difficult decisions’ in office.

‘We would have to have cuts in police,
we would have to have cuts in the schools budget, we would have to have
cuts in the defence budget,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s The World at One.

Split: The party is said to be divided on over whether to apologise for the mistakes of the Blair and Brown years

Many people have spent months calling for David Miliband to take over Labour's crown from his brother but this morning the BBC appeared to join the debate too when it accidentally announced David Miliband's speech was 'Coming Up'.

As reporters waited for Ed Miliband to take to the stage at London's Oxo Tower for his keynote speech, the Beeb flashed an alert on television screens across the nation announcing: 'Coming up: David Miliband speech'.

The error will not have impressed Ed Miliband who has had a famously fractious relationship with his brother since he became Leader of the Opposition.

A screen grab of the mistake was quickly tweeted following the blunder at 11.29am

Whoops: The BBC made a mistake this morning when it said that David Miliband's speech was coming up - instead of Ed Miliband's
