Arsenal have told Real Sociedad they will activate the £3.5million buy-back option on Carlos Vela.

Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay has been in London for talks with Arsenal this week in an attempt to buy the Mexico striker but on Tuesday night confirmed: ‘Arsenal have informed us that Vela would be with them next season.’

Top gun: Carlos Vela had an excellent season at Real Sociedad, and will return to Arsenal this summer

Progress: Arsene Wenger is looking to build on his team's FA Cup success by finding backup for Olivier Giroud

Then and now: Vela started his career at Arsenal before flourishing at Sociedad - he is now set to return

Jan 2006 - Aug 2012: Arsenal11 goals in 64 games

Jul 2006 - May 2007: Salamanca (loan)  8 goals in 31 games

Jul 2007 - May 2008: Osasuna (loan) 3 goals in 33 games

Jan 2011 - May 2011: West Brom (loan) 2 goals in 8 games

Aug 2011 - Jul 2012: Real Sociedad (loan) 12 goals in 35 games

Aug 2012 - Jun 2014: Real Sociedad 31 goals in 78 games

The 25-year-old enjoyed a magnificent Liga last season last term, scoring 16 goals and grabbing 12 assists in 34 appearances.

Vela will not be representing Mexico in the World Cup, having not played for his country since 2011, so would be fresh for next season.

Signed in 2006 as a 17-year-old, Vela was tipped for big things by Arsene Wenger but never reached his potential at the club.

Relegated to playing on the left wing, and sent out on loan to four different clubs, Vela scored just 11 times for the first team in six years at Arsenal.

However, with the Gunners boss looking to buy strikers as back-up to front man Olivier Giroud, Vela has become a target for Wenger.
