Sixty-five years after Enid Blyton created Noddy, a collection of memorabilia featuring the cheerful children’s book character is expected to fetch £50,000 at auction.

It belonged to late bookseller Thomas Schuster, who spent 18 years scouring fairs for items. His widow Greta, from Torquay, has put the items, including a model of Noddy in a car with his friend Big Ears, up for sale at Chiswick Auctions in West London on November 19.

Watercolours by Dutch artist Harmsden van der Beek, who created the image of Noddy, are among the lots expected to fetch up to £1,000 each.

Tony Summerfield, Secretary of the Enid Blyton Society, said: ‘There is a still a lot of nostalgia about Noddy.’

Last year the original Noddy Car, based on a 1969 Fiat Gamine Vagnale, sold at auction for £29,325.

The two-seater roadster was built by Italian firm Carrozzeria Vignale and has a top speed of about 65mph thanks to its 595cc engine.

The car had covered just 4,553 miles from new and included the numberplate "NOD 513".

The first auction of Noddy art, in October, 1997, raised £350,000 for parent company Enid Blyton Limited, which was double the pre-sale estimate.

More than 200 million copies of the adventures of the wooden taxi driver have been sold worldwide and they remain popular with children today.
