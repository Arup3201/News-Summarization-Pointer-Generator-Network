Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino has declared he intends to write himself into the club’s history books by getting the better of Arsenal in his first North London derby.

The Argentinian says he knows exactly how significant the fixture is for supporters of both sides and has called upon his players to show bravery as well as skill at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday evening.

The 42-year-old, who left Southampton in May to succeed Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane said: 'We are ambitious. We arrived three months ago and we need to make our way but we are focused on the game and know the history. But it is also important to write the history, starting now.'

The history books show that Arsenal enjoy a vastly superior record in home derbies as Tottenham’s only away victory since May 1993 was a 3-2 success in November 2010.

But Pochettino’s first derby while in charge of Espanyol saw his under-dogs beat Barcelona 2-1 at the Nou Camp and he outlined the ingredients he believed his players would need to succeed on Saturday.

He said: 'We need to be clear in our own way and in our performance. We need to put in a good performance from beginning to end to get the victory. We need to be aggressive and focused on our job, never give up and try to get the victory - this is the winning mentality we need to have.'

Tottenham have taken just a single point from their last three Premier League games, against Liverpool, Sunderland and West Bromwich having beaten West Ham and Queens Park Rangers in their first two, but did dispose of Championship leaders Nottingham Forest in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night, coming back from a goal down to win 3-1.

Pochettino added: 'It was a different competition but it was important for our confidence. But we know we need to change. The game on Saturday is different to Nottingham Forest and different to West Bromwich. We need to show our skill and we need to be brave to play against Arsenal.'
