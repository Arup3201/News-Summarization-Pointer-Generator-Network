A very lucky dog in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, did not have to find out firsthand if the saying 'all dogs go to heaven' is true on Friday.

That's because Susie, the four-year-old Matipoo belonging to Elaine Caralis, somehow managed to miraculously survive a fall down a 15-flight air-conditioning shaft.

According to Caralis, 68, the two were guests at a friends 16th floor apartment in the building. Upon their arrival, Susie began to follow a scent that lead to an open closet.

That's when Susie got into an exhaust shaft and fell. Caralis told CNN that she thinks that a ventilation panel that would have normally covered the shaft was missing, allowing her dog to get in.

It took emergency responders three hours to cut holes above and below the second floor to reach Susie. Eventually, emergency responders were able to reach the dog and remove her from the shaft.

Caralis was grateful for the efforts of the rescuers, calling them 'heroic.'

'I don't have children,' she said, 'so Susie is 
my life, Susie is my family. They treated it like they were searching 
for a human being.'

Susie was rushed to an animal hospital after the incident, where Dr. Spencer L. Ratnoff was prepared for the worst. However, according to him, Susie sustained no broken bones or internal bleeding, a 'miracle' in addition to the other miracle that she could survive the fall in the first place.

'I'm thinking 15 stories, there are going to be multiple fractures, 
severe internal injuries or worse," he said. "I was worried it might 
need to be euthanized.'

According to Ratnoff, the dog experienced only bruising from the fall. Susie is expected to make a full recovery.
