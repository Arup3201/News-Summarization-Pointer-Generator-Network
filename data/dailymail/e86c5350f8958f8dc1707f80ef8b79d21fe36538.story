Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard has advised Manchester United counterpart David de Gea to look upon the defensive upheaval at Manchester United as a challenge to improve his leadership skills.

De Gea, regarded as one of the best shot-stoppers in the world, has conceded 13 goals in seven games this season and looked a forlorn figure with the personnel in front of him changing regularly due to injury, suspension and differing formations.

Howard, 35, spent three seasons at United as a young goalkeeper and believes 23-year-old de Gea needs to learn how to play more of a key role in marshalling his back-four.

Ahead of Everton's visit to Old Trafford on Sunday, Howard argued: 'It is easier when everything is settled in front of you, but for a goalkeeper it is part of the challenge when it's not.

'De Gea is still a young goalkeeper, even as talented as he is. If he can learn that, how to get your point across to different players and get them to respond to you very quickly, that will be a good lesson.

'You have to use a lot of body language, when the ball is out of play and there is a lull in the crowd, you try to make your point concisely.

'You talk to players in the dressing room before the game. You don't want to cloud their thoughts with too many things but you get a few points across to them. It is all a learning process.

'It feels like it was only in the last five years when I turned 30 that I started to really perfect things so it takes a while. But some guys do it quicker than others.'

Howard was part of Everton's seen that gained their first victory at Old Trafford in 17 years last season and quipped: 'We cracked it, so we want do it again.'

And despite Everton currently lying 15th in the table with only one Premier League victory this season, the American regards Wayne Rooney's suspension for United as a big boost for his team.

Howard will come up against world stars like Angel Di Maria, Robin van Persie and Falcao at Old Trafford but still thinks the absence of his former United team-mate Rooney is cause for optimism after the striker was sent off last weekend for kicking Stewart Downing against West Ham.

'It is great for us that Rooney won't be playing. Everyone has an opinion about him but as far as I am concerned, Wayne Rooney is a threat. He is a very dangerous threat.

'The more of those you can eliminate, the better. From his standpoint, it is disappointing he is suspended. But for us, it helps us. It is one less thing to worry about.'

Howard, who has been at Everton seven years and equalled the club's European appearance record when he faced Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday, is enjoying an extraordinary Indian summer to his career.

His World Cup performances for the USA led to a phone call of congratulations from American President Barack Obama and a petition for airports to be named after him.

There has been a minor backlash this season with Howard scrutinised for every goal conceded, particularly when Everton were surprisingly beaten at home by Crystal Palace.

'If I came back again as a footballer, I'd choose to be a number nine. You can miss five chances, score one goal, and you are a hero,' smiled Howard. 'Goalkeepers get caned all over the gaffe. Part of being a top goalkeeper is handling it. There are two goalkeepers in England at the moment (presumably Joe Hart and Simon Mignolet, though Howard declined to name them) who are getting crucified. It is a witch-hunt.'

'I have been at this a long time. The celebrity thing and all that nonsense happened and I was suddenly being invited to all these events and premieres. If it had happened to me as a young kid, it might have been different but I ended up declining most of them to stay at home with the family. I just doing the regular everyday stuff.'
