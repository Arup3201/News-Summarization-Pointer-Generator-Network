Shantanu Starick has spent almost three years traveling the world - and it hasn't cost him a cent.

The 26-year-old from Byron Bay has managed his globe-trotting adventure by trading his skills as a photographer for everything he needs, from food to shelter and transport.

'If someone told you that you can get around the world without spending a cent, they would tell you it's not possible. Unless, that is, if you can change your perception and allow yourself to create different rules and a different way of thinking,' Mr Starick told Daily Mail Australia.

Shantanu Starick has travelled across 6 continents over 33 months without spending a cent

Mr Starick trades his photography skills for life's basics- food, shelter and transport to his next trade.

Before he started out, he was told it wasn't possible to travel the globe using only the 'bartering economy.' But he set off anyway, with no currency and contracts - just a camera and 'an eager smile.'

Starting his career as a freelance photographer, Mr Starick said modern day workplaces tended to funnel creative people like himself into specialties, where what was he was looking for was diversity.

He decided to take off on the journey of a lifetime taking money out of the conversation and allowing his creative pursuits to take precedence.

'Money can really hinder creativity,' Mr Starick said.

'Anything can seem possible without applying that restriction,' he added.

Mr Starick claims that by eliminating money from his travels he's been able to connect on a different level creatively with his clients.

'The real gem that comes from trading is how we can start to do more creative work with others, without the conversation focusing on money.' 

Mr Starick likens his philosophy to that of companies like Uber and Airbnb where there is no cash exchange between clients and more focus on personal interaction. 

'Really, an uber driver is no different to a taxi driver. The huge difference is, that at the end of the day, you are being dropped at the airport like a relative is dropping you off. It's like being dropped to a restaurant by a friend.' 

Diversity is exquisite: Mr Starick's unofficial mantra leads him to photograph a diverse range of subjects

With 197 trades under his belt Mr Starick's travels have spanned 6 continents with Antarctica in his sights

Mr Starick, who often stays in the homes of his clients, has become accustom to the nomadic lifestyle. He says after almost three years of house hopping, it takes longer for his host to get comfortable than he does.

'People often tell their guests to make themselves at home and I think I put them at ease by being so comfortable.'

'It takes me about two minutes to be drinking milk out of the carton, even if I have just met you two minutes ago. I walk into a home, and I am home,' he added.

The nomadic photographer insists that by taking money out of the equation we can allow ourselves to make a genuine human connection

Mr Starick said he doesn't ask for much and has never discussed the details of exactly what he would receive in a trade, leaving it up to his clients to pay with what they can.

'I don't have any expectations apart from hoping it's good food and a comfortable bed,' he said. 

With 197 trades under his belt Mr Starick's travels have spanned 6 continents. He is adamant he will make it to Antarctica at some stage but at the moment he is inundated with requests for his services.

Mr Stanick said he has spent a lot of time in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the USA

 His portfolio has no limits as he dabbles in shooting food, weddings, travel, landscapes and cities

'Sometimes I find it overwhelming. There are days or weeks where I don't answer emails because I just can't. You could spend hours every day on email but I don't want to get caught up in that every day. Some days I just want to shoot or explore and interact with people.' 

Mr Starick was surprised to find weddings to be some of his most enjoyable projects. 

'[The wedding] industry was very one dimensional, in my opinion, but luckily these days people are wanting a lot more from their wedding day.' 

Initially finding the wedding industry 'one dimensional' Mr Starick said his perception couldn't have changed more over his journey

Mr Stanick started to see the raw human connection people have through celebrating a couples special day

'You end up celebrating your friend's wedding, but they have only been your friend for a few days, it becomes quite intimate.'

Mr Starick said his journey has given him the opportunity to meet ' so many amazing people who have effected me in very different ways,' but  Matt and Lentil's wedding changed everything for him.

Two days before the wedding he stayed with a group of their friends and prepared for the big day. This gave him the chance to become a part of the wedding instead of just taking record of it.

'When the wedding day came they were like brother and sister to me.

'They were the most open minded, beautiful people and I got to celebrate the two of them having their big love day, around their equally incredible friends and family.'

After spending two days with the couples closest friends and family Mr Starick says he became an organic part of the wedding 

Mr Starick is currently in Brazil photographing for a not-for-profit group who send American school leavers on a gap year to undertake community projects and live with local families. 

'There's a real diversity in subject matter for me here. We go from farms, to schools, to beaches,' he said.  

To Mr Starick diversity was the reason he ventured out into the world and after photographing cook books, weddings, dancers, farms and cityscapes, he really has achieved it.

'Diversity is exquisite, it really is.'
