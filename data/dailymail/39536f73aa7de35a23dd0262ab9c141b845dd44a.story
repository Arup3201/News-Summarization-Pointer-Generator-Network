Hospitalised children were left stunned as four of the world's most famous superheroes appeared at their 12th floor window.

Spiderman, Batman, Captain America and Superman's mission for the day was to cheer up the patients at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh as they did their window cleaning rounds.

The group of window washers said they wanted to put smiles on the faces of the children battling illnesses at the hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Is it a bird? It is a plane? No, it's window washers who dressed up as superheroes to entertain patients at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania

Organiser Edward Matuizek, is
president of Allegheny Window Cleaning, which has the fitting company motto of 'The sky is the limit.'

He said: 'All the guys had tears of joy in their eyes behind the costumes -
 it was very touching and overwhelming how excited the children were.'

The
 experienced high-rise washers positioned their safety harnesses around 
the costumes before unfurling their ropes from the 12th floor and 
abseiling along the walls.

Dozens
 of hospitalised youngsters pointed in amazement as they came into view 
and saluted to them before the cleaning job began.

Allegheny's office manager Michelle Matuizek, Edward's wife, suggested the costume idea after seeing a similar scheme in the UK.

The firm spent $800 on 'Broadway-quality' costumes for the two-hour job to make sure they were believable.

They are planning similar jobs in the future and said they have made the scheme a cornerstone of their community work.
