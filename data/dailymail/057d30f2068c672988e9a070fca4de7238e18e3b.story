His first burial was an undignified one - dumped in a shallow grave with no coffin or shroud following the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.

But after its discovery under a Leicester car park, the body of Richard III will finally be laid to rest in surroundings fit for a king, as the first pictures of his potential tomb are revealed.

Computer-generated images show the 7ft (2.1 metre) long, magnesian limestone tomb that the Richard III Society hopes he well be buried in.

Optimistic Philippa Langley, who led the society's eventual discovery of the last Plantagenet monarch's remains, commissioned the designs in 2010 before the remains had even been discovered.

The designs, which have only now been released, incorporate the white rose of York and several inscriptions wrought in
stone and on a metal plaque.

It also features the Cross of St. Cuthbert, symbolic of his devotion to the Christian faith  and Richard’s personal emblem, the white boar. 

Leicester Cathedral, where the remains are expected to be re-interred next year, have yet to make a final decision on the tomb's appearance and its exact location.

Some were left disappointed when a decision was taken not to bury the notorious King's body at a state funeral in Westminster Abbey.

The cathedral is to commission architects on March 12 and is expecting to receive draft designs in the summer.

Foresight: Optimistic Philippa Langley, who led the society's eventual discovery of the last Plantagenet monarch's remains, commissioned the designs in 2010

A spokesman for the Richard III Society said: 'The tomb design was commissioned by Philippa Langley in September 2010 at the very beginning of the Looking For Richard project.

'It is based on Richard's life, and what was important and meaningful to him, and the design was undertaken by a team of specialists with over 40 years of research into Richard III.

'The society is looking forward to working with the cathedral and Leicester City Council to honour the return of the king.'

The designs would cost around £30,000 to implement, which the society hopes will met through donations.

It said 65 per cent of the costs had already been met for the tomb, which would take four months to construct.

The centuries-old 
mystery of what happened to the body of Richard III was answered earlier this months when scientists from Leicester university confirmed the remains were those of the king.

Their tests revealed how appallingly he was treated in death after defeat at the hands of 
Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.

The hunchback king: The skeleton, unearthed in a
dig last September, showed evidence of the same curvature of the spine 
and battle injuries thought to have been suffered by the last 
Plantagenet king

The face of a king: There were cheers from media who had gathered from around the world as the announcement was made at the University of Leicester this morning

Clues: Richard III's skeleton showed signs of horrific injuries and the curved spine also matched accounts of the humpback king

Stripped naked with his hands tied, and scarred by multiple ‘humiliation
wounds’ inflicted as his body was paraded through Leicester, Richard 
III was dumped in a shallow grave with no coffin or shroud.

Using historical maps, archaeologists had traced a friary where
the king was rumoured to have been buried, which now lies beneath a 
social services department car park in Leicester.

Screenwriter Miss Langley described the chill she felt when walking 
through the car park in August 2009: ‘It was a hot summer and I had 
goosebumps so badly and I was freezing cold.

'I walked past a particular 
spot and absolutely knew I was walking on his grave.’

Only three weeks 
into the dig in September 2011, her instincts appeared to be confirmed 
when researchers found the skeleton of an adult male in a badly-dug 
grave who had a severely curved spine: Richard was famously nicknamed 
Crookback.

The bones were subjected to ‘rigorous academic study’ by a team from the
University of Leicester, and those involved were all sworn to secrecy.

The remains had lain almost completely undisturbed less than three feet 
below ground, but were almost destroyed when a 19th century outhouse was
built just inches away.

DNA from the skeleton was matched with two of Richard’s living 
descendants – Canadian-born furniture maker Michael Ibsen, whose mother 
was a direct descendant of the king’s sister Anne of York, and a second 
anonymous individual.

The curved spine of the skeleton and its numerous wounds also helped 
confirm the ‘astonishing’ discovery, even if Richard’s so-called 
withered arm appears to be a myth.

The Battle of Bosworth: Richard, pictured on the

field, in a battle which marked the end of his line and the rise of the 
Tudors

Studies revealed the remains dated back to the era of the War of the 
Roses, while the individual was found to be in his late 20s to 30s. 
Richard III was 32 when he died.

His skeleton was found to have suffered ten injuries at the time of 
death, but only two skull wounds were potentially fatal and were most 
likely inflicted by a sword or a halberd – a spiked axe on a pole.

The corpse was subjected to ‘humiliation injuries’ – including a sword 
through the right buttock – likely to have been inflicted after death.

The pronounced curvature of the spine, caused by severe scoliosis, 
supports the Shakespearean description of the monarch as ‘rudely 
stamp’d, deformed, unfinish’d’.

But the findings suggest the Bard used dramatic licence when describing Richard as having a withered arm.

Richard III ruled for only two years following the death of his brother,
Edward IV. His body was discovered at Grey Friars, a Franciscan friary 
destroyed during Henry VIII’s Dissolution of the Monasteries.
