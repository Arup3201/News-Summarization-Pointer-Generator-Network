Each week Sportsmail gathers the best Barclays Premier League starting XI of Saturday.

No less than five Chelsea players feature after Jose Mourinho's team beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield, though none of Brendan Rodgers' men make our list.

Manchester City stumbled again but that was far from Sergio Aguero's fault, whose two goals ensured Manuel Pellegrini left Loftus Road with a point.

Scroll down to find out which players make our best XI from Saturday's Premier League action.

GK - Brad Guzan (West Ham vs ASTON VILLA) - 8 

An incredible save at the end that denied the returning Andy Carroll a goal led manager Paul Lambert to label the goalkeeper 'world class'. It saved Villa a well-earned point at Upton Park.

DEF - Branislav Ivanovic (Liverpool vs CHELSEA) - 7.5

Every successful team needs a player like this teak-tough Serbia international. Does his job immaculately every week, and looked every bit a Premier League winner against Liverpool.

DEF - Richard Dunne (QUEENS PARK RANGERS vs Manchester City) - 7.5

Brilliant early block to deny Samir Nasri. Even brought the ball out from the back on occasion to allow QPR to build attacks. Heroic display - and a clearance off the line thrown in, too.

DEF - John Terry (Liverpool vs CHELSEA) - 8

Unlikely to ever win a popularity contest but the centre-back is still the best English central defender in the country. Never in trouble with JT around, as Liverpool found out at Anfield on Saturday.

Chelsea captain John Terry is unlikely to win a popularity contest but saw off Liverpool well on Saturday

DEF - Cesar Azpilicueta (Liverpool vs CHELSEA) - 8

Another who doesn’t get headlines but does a crucial job in Chelsea's back four. A superb run and cross created the winner for Diego Costa, shaking off Philippe Coutinho as if he wasn't there.

MID - Stewart Downing (WEST HAM vs Aston Villa) - 7.5

Followed his England call-up with another impressive display as the 30-year-old took set pieces, tirelessly ran from deep, had a range of long passes and put in some fine crosses, too.

MID - Nemanja Matic (Liverpool vs CHELSEA) - 8.5

Has never failed to impress since returning for his second stint at Stamford Bridge. He gave the team talk beforehand and led by example during the 2-1 win against Liverpool. Simply outstanding

MID - Michael Carrick (MANCHESTER UNITED vs Crystal Palace) - 7.5

Planted between Wayne Rooney, Marouane Fellaini, and the back four. Did the tidying up better than anybody at Old Trafford on Saturday and put in a shift for Louis van Gaal, running 6.9 miles.

MID - Eden Hazard (Liverpool vs CHELSEA) - 8

Took the breath away at times at Anfield with his speed, balance and skill against a Liverpool team that couldn't contain him. Always had Liverpool spinning in circles when on the ball.

FWD - Bobby Zamora (QUEENS PARK RANGERS vs Manchester City) - 8

Gives QPR an added dimension. Sometimes there is no shame in going a touch longer and Zamora is the perfect battering ram. Won everything against City.

QPR striker Bobby Zamora won everything against the reigning Premier League champions - but the game

FWD - Sergio Aguero (Queens Park Rangers vs MANCHESTER CITY) - 9

He’s just too good. Give him a chance and Aguero scores. It’s 14 for the season now and his two touches in mid-air were superb to fashion the first. Where would City be without him? 

Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero was on another planet, scoring twice in the 2-2 draw on Saturday
