This is the dramatic moment a newsagent chased an armed robber out of his shop - by threatening to hit him with a hammer.

The raider, who said he was carrying a gun, was caught on CCTV cameras storming into Monica News store, in Birmingham's Small Heath.

But just seconds later he can be seen sprinting out of the shop after assistant Sajid Hussein bravely confronted him.

The robber had threatened to kill Mr Hussein, unless he put cash into a yellow plastic bag he was carrying.

But Police said the gunman then fled empty handed at around 10.40am on Tuesday.

Father-of-one Mr Hussein, 40, said: 'I saw this man come into the shop and come straight up to me. I knew something wasn’t quite right so I stood my ground.

'He told me "give me money or I’ll kill you".

'He forced me into the back room where he thought there must be the safe but I managed to grab a hammer I’d been using to put up some shelves.

'I forced him back and held the hammer in his face and he looked really shocked.

'I waved it close to his face and he just shrank away. He sounded pretty scared and just ran off.'

Shop owner Mudasar Majeed, 27, who was out of the shop at a cash and carry at the time, praised his loyal assistant for his bravery.

He said: 'The chap walked into the shop and had a gun half covered under a cloth.

'He asked the assistant to put everything from the till into his bag.

'Luckily the guy had a hammer and chased him away from the shop. He acted very bravely.

'He was pretty shaken up yesterday but no-one was hurt and nothing was taken. He was back at work today and which just shows you the kind of man he is.

'It’s the first time anything like this has happened and it won’t make us shut up shop that’s for sure.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'An Asian man wearing dark clothing, who said he was carrying a gun demanded cash before the shopkeeper picked up a hammer and the man ran out empty handed.'
