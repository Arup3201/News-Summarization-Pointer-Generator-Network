The father of a two-year-old girl has accused his ex-wife of teaching their daughter how to smoke cigarettes after shocking images of the tot emerged on the internet.

Gabriel Burulea is now demanding permanent custody of his daughter after claiming that his ex posted a video on YouTube of their child smoking at home in Bughea de Sus, Arges, Romania.

It is also alleged that she taught the youngster to like coffee.

Concerns: Gabriel Burulea, 30, claims his ex wife Elena Ursu posted a video of their daughter smoking and drinking coffee just to infuriate him

Shocking: A Romanian father has been awarded temporary custody of his two-year-old toddler after his ex-wife reportedly posted a video of their daughter smoking cigarettes

The couple split up a year ago but full custody of the young girl was awarded to Elena Ursu, 28.

It is now believed that Mr Burulea has been awarded temporary custody of the child following the release of the video.

The concerned father is now hoping it will lead to him being awarded permanent custody of his daughter.

According to Orange News, Mr Burulea
 said: 'She wants to taunt me by showing me how she is treating our 
child, but I hope it will backfire and be what I need to win custody.

'Our daughter doesn't want milk - just coffee - and instead of sweets she wants cigarettes. It's terrible.

Coffee drinker: The little girl is then handed a cup of coffee which she swallows enthusiastically

'When
 I am allowed to visit her I can see that she is so desperate for a 
cigarette that she even grabs the ends of cigarettes and puts them in 
her mouth. It's sick.'

The 
video - which has now been removed by YouTube - showed the girl smoking 
and her mother seemingly encouraging her to do so.

This is not the first time that images of a baby apparently smoking have appeared on the internet.

A teenage mother was investigated by police after photographs of her six-month-old son with a cigarette in his mouth were posted on Facebook.

Worrying: This image is believed to show Elena Ursu watching and encouraging her daughter to smoke

Rebecca Davey, 18, was reported by online friends last year who spotted the picture of baby Ollie.

It showed the tot in a striped babygro, with the unlit cigarette hanging from his mouth.

Essex Police visited Rebecca's home in Southend, Essex, but said there were 'no immediate concerns' for the child's welfare. Social services also made inquiries.

Child protection officers in America were also forced to investigate after a mother posted a photo of her 11-month-old son apparently smoking a marijuana bong pipe last year.

Rachel Stieringer, 19, from Keystone Heights, Florida, took the disturbing image of her child sitting on a 
blanket wearing a nappy and putting the green glass smoking instrument 
to his mouth as if he were inhaling it.

She then posted it online,
 but child protection services stepped in when they were tipped offÂ  
about the picture and Stierlinger was arrested.

She was charged with a misdemeanor count of possessing drug 
paraphernalia and she later agreed to attend a drugs rehabilitation programme.
