Are you a folder, a stacker, a hanger, a shover-inner or a hide-away-in-a-drawer kind of person?

Exactly how you keep your clothes - and therefore just how tidy your wardrobe is - says a lot about a person.

And one award-winning Italian photographer, Pietro Baroni, set out to explore just how much, taking a series of very intimate photographs of some residents of Milan next to their closets, giving the viewer a snapshot into each subject's life.

And regardless of what we know about Italian style, it seems the people of Italy's fashion capital have just as many fashion disasters as the rest of us....

The Student: Chiara, a student in Milan, opens her white wardrobe in her pink room and shows the photographer her shoe collection

Baroni travelled all over the Italian city (known for its designer gear and luxury goods) on the hunt for a variety of different people whose styles and fashion blunders would provide an insight into their characters.

On his journey he met a wide range of clothes-keepers - women, men, couples and teenagers - each of whom had a wardrobe with a totally unique story to tell.

There is Chaira the student, whose pink 
bedroom contains a white wardrobe full of high-heeled shoes; Denise the 
fancy-dress fanatic whose large cupboard is stuffed full of Hello Kitty 
get-ups and anime outfits; Glenda the entrepreneur who shares her 
bedroom with a cat and dachshund, but keeps her wardrobe to herself and crams it with colourful
dresses and hats; and Suni the glass artist, whose wardrobe is in her 
workshop.

Baroni also found two retired couples with contrasting closets, a PR man with a fascination with air travel, two journalists - one male, one female - with completely different ways of organising their clothes, a priest, a pair of tattoo artists and a couple of teenage girls.

The unique collection of images, dubbed Milan Closets, has earned the 
35-year-old an honourable mention in the People Lifestyle category of 
the 2012 International Photography Awards.

He said: 'To the rest of the world Milan is one of the main references for fashion and luxury brands. The true vision of the everyday is almost blocked and hidden by the big names in fashion and design. For this project I wanted to photograph the ordinary Milanese people in front of their open closets.

'They are all different ages, genders, social classes and professions 
because I wanted to create a collage of a mixed city that hides its most
intriguing side. I have tried to find and am still continuing to look for these extraordinary people.'
