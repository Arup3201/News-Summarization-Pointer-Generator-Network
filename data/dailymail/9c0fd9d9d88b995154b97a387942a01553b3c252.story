Taylor Swift dishes out plenty of jibes to ex lovers, but it seems she has a rather thin skin herself.

The country singer has hit back at comedians Tina Fey and Amy Poehler for mocking her love life at Hollywood's Golden Globe Awards this year.

She branded the jab sexist in an interview with magazineÂ Vanity Fair on Tuesday, and suggested the pair will go to 'hell' for the comment.

During the awards broadcast, hosts Fey and Poehler threw a barb at the singer, telling her to 'stay away' from actor Michael J. Fox's 23-year-old son.

Not amused: Taylor Swift has hit out at Tina Fey and Amy Poehler for mocking her love life at Hollywood's Golden Globe Awards

The Grammy-winning singer is well 
known for documenting her personal relationships in her songs, often 
leaving little clues in the lyrics that hint at the subject.

She has been linked to high profile 
celebrities such as John Mayer, Jake Gyllenhaal, Taylor Lautner, Joe 
Jonas and more recently, Conor Kennedy and One Direction's Harry Styles.

In the Vanity Fair interview, Swift, 
23, responded to the Golden Globes incident by citing a saying told to 
her by talk show host Katie Couric that 'there's a special place in hell
 for women who don't help other women.'

'For a female to write about her 
feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate 
girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I 
think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrated - a 
woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way - that's taking 
it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a 
little sexist,' Swift said.

Poehler was quick to respond to Swift's comments, telling The Hollywood Reporter: 'Aw, I feel bad if she was upset. I am a feminist and she is a young and talented girl. That being said, I do agree I am going to hell. But for other reasons. Mostly boring tax stuff.'

Fey was less sympathetic, telling Entertainment Tonight: 'If anyone was going to get mad at us, I thought it would be James Cameron. I did not see that one coming. It was a joke. It was a light-hearted joke.'

(Fey was referring to a swipe made at the ex husband of Zero Dark Thirty director Kathryn Bigelow. They said when it comes to torture, they 'trust the lady who spent three years married to James Cameron.')

Swift's latest hit We Are Never Ever 
Getting Back Together was presumed to be about Gyllenhaal while I Knew 
You Were Trouble is said to be about Mayer.

Swift, who notably refuses to reveal 
details of her personal life, didn't name any names herself in the 
interview, but said 'since 2010 I have dated exactly two people,' 
referring to Kennedy and Styles.

According to Vanity Fair, Swift gave 
permission for an unnamed source to speak about her relationships in 
more detail, revealing that Styles, 19, had 'chased' Swift for a year 
and 'wore her down' into dating him.

The relationship ended after Styles 
was photographed kissing another woman, but he 'pursued her for the 
better part of a year until she finally took him back,' the source said.

Swift, who became a teenage darling 
within the country-pop scene for her raw, honest and catchy songs, has 
seen her music slowly becoming overshadowed by the spotlight cast on her
 private life.

'I'm dealing with a little bit of a 
chaotic media circus right now ... But there's also a lesson in all this
 ... In knowing that you can live your life in a way that you're proud 
of and people are still gonna take shots,' Swift said.

The full interview will appear in 
Vanity Fair's April issue, out in New York and Los Angles on Thursday 
and nationally on March 12.
