A man charged with the murder of his younger brother at a wake for their other brother appeared in court today.

Police and paramedics were called to 
the address in Eltham Green Road at 1.40am on Saturday and Mr Hayes was 
pronounced dead at the scene.

A post-mortem gave cause of death as a stab wound to the chest.

Neighbours heard screams from an 
end-of-terrace house in Eltham, south east London, where Mark lives with
his 49-year-old wife Carla.

Police and paramedics were called to reports of a stabbing in the early hours.

Two other men, aged 23 and 48, also arrested at the scene have been released on bail, pending further inquiries.

The father-of-three was arrested on suspicion of murder and will appear at Bromley Magistrates Court on Monday

Mark Hayes, who appeared at Bromley 
Magistrates Court, via videolink, wearing a smart grey shirt, spoke only
to confirm his name and address during a brief hearing.

He was remanded in custody to appear 
at the Old Bailey on Wednesday. A jury trial date will be fixed at a future hearing.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Mark Hayes has been charged with the murder of Shaun Hayes, aged 48, on Saturday.

One neighbour told the Sun: 'I heard this massive commotion outside. A woman was screaming her lungs out and within minutes the police arrived. The man on the ground was just lying there, still as a statue.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
