 When Ian Rogerson was given the shock news that his three-year-old son Jack had developed autism, he didn’t even flinch at the decision to quit his life as a high-flying radio personality to care for him.

Almost immediately the up-and-coming star - who appeared as one-half of a successful Australian radio duo, based in Sydney, in the 1980s alongside Jonathan Coleman – made his mind up 15-years-ago that he and wife Nicole were going to fight to better their son’s health.

Their story – which revolves around their eldest son's battle with autism- is one of thousands untold in the battle to overcome the condition and will be aired on ABC’s Australian Story tonight.

The Sydney couple describe how they went from rock bottom sitting in their car after learning of Jack's condition, to watching their son graduate school as one of the top of his class this year.

‘We got to one pediatrician and we’d been to see him a couple of times,’ Mr Rogerson said.

‘And on one of the visits – it was just a bit of a throw away, (the pediatrician said) ‘oh, he’s got autism.’

‘It was one of those things – it really hit.’

He and wife Nicole remember the day vividly, shattered that a disease they thought they couldn’t fix was going to burden their ‘perfect child’ for the rest of his life.

‘It was raining,’ Nicole said, ‘and Jack was sitting in the back of the car oblivious making all those baby sounds and I think for about half an hour we thought it was the end of the earth.’

‘And then we thought, well, bugger you let’s see what we can do about this.’

Prior to the diagnosis, Jack was born a healthy boy, the ‘perfect child’ his father described him, a quiet, well-behaved toddler who hardly made a peep at night and was a pleasure to take into public.

But by age three, the Rogersons discovered Jack wasn’t growing into the same boy many of his peers around him were. He was becoming increasingly agitated by sound and light, showed little sign of emotion and displayed no affection.

Jack was in the grip of a relatively unknown disease that changed the Rogerson's life dramatically.

Mr Rogerson was enjoying life as a successful media identity having carved out a partnership with Australian radio host Jonathan Coleman as 'Johno and Dano' in the 1980s.

When he announced he was leaving the industry to care of his son, many coined it 'career suicide', but Mr Rogerson said the priority of his son's health was paramount and that was all that mattered.

He subsequenlty ended his career in top-rating radio shows and a string of national television programs to better his son's health.

'It didn't really matter what I did, or what my job was - if something is wrong with your child, you need to fix,' he said.

Mr Rogerson's story of how he and his wife Nicole turned Jack's life around, after enlisting the professionalism of pioneer autism researcher Elizabeth Watson, is remarkable.

At his worst, Jack was hyperactive an inaudible child who could barely speak.

‘He would scream and tantrum. He was just in his own world,’ his father said.

His mother said health professionals had written him off, and that there was little help available.

But now 18, Jack has taken huge steps in his battle to beat autism, all thanks to his involvement in an early intervention program known as Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).

The turning point in Jack’s life came in 1999 when the Rogersons met Ms Watson, a speech pathologist and therapist pioneering the treatment which focuses on all areas of development including communication, play, self-help, fine and gross motor as well as academic skills.

It addressed Jack’s problematic behaviours' including tantrums, as well as some socially inappropriate behaviours.

The program also helps children perform basic tasks such as tying shoelaces.

But for many not as fortunate as Jack, the program is simply out of reach.

Ongoing treatment requires a huge financial investment due to a lack of Government-funded support. About one in every 100 child’s family will experience autism and only children whose family can afford treatment make successful progress to beat it.

Mr Rogerson said some people pay upward of of ‘$40,000 a year,’ for the ABA program, but for him it was worth every cent

'I'm so glad we did...we've got such a beautiful child.'

Mrs Rogerson said involvement such as the ABA shows what is possible with the help of early intervention for autism.

'Jack's progress shows what is possible,' mother Nicole, who is now CEO of Autism Awareness Australia, said.

'We know that kids in Australia, one in a hundred of them, have Autism Spectrum Disorder and the reality is the vast majority are not getting anywhere near best practice guidelines for treatment of Autism.'

She said unless the government makes a genuine investment in this area, so many children are not going to reach their best outcome.

'And I think that's a tragedy.'
