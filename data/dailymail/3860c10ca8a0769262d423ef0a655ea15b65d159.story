He joined Hitler's fledgling Nazi party and soon became a trusted aide and even towards the end of the war the German leader referred to him as 'der treue Heinrich' (the loyal Heinrich).

However, In 1945 a disillusioned Himmler believed victory had slipped from Germany's grasp.

He secretly attempted to start peace negotiations with Eisenhower, who was then Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, in a bid to escape a war crimes trial.

But Eisenhower refused to have anything to do with Himmler.

A furious Hitler declared Himmler a traitor, stripped him of his powers and the SS chief went on the run.

However before he could be interrogated, he committed suicide the following day by swallowing a cyanide capsule.

The auction will take place at Mullock's Specialist Auctioneers & Valuers in Church Stretton, Shropshire, on Thursday.
