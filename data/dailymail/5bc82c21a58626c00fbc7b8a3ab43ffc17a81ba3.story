Alex Song is sifting through an assortment of clothes. They are not the flamboyant kind he is accustomed to wearing, but they have been personally selected by him from West Ham’s club shop to wear for this photo shoot.

‘I like this one... but definitely not this one. I would never choose to wear this one,’ he says as he swaps a questionable navy pattern jumper for a smart navy claret cuff polo top.

Then Cheikhou Kouyate bursts into the room. The midfielder merrily hums a tune before offering a warm welcome to those waiting in the wings, watching his team-mate deliver a sequence of Vogue-esque poses for the cameras.

Suddenly Kouyate stops. ‘Hey, hey... why do you not ask me?’

He knows why. Song is West Ham’s ultimate fashion icon.

Forget Andy Carroll, whose recent collaboration with Alexander Wang and H&M hit the billboards of Times Square in the Big Apple.

Song is the man to be beaten for style here in Essex.

Just take a look at the 27-year-old’s Instagram account and you’ll find various pictures of him sporting outfits which many would deem to be outrageous. Pink cardigan, a large trilby hat and a sarong draped over white jeans complete with white shirt, white cap and large red moonboot sneakers. That's just for starters.

The Hammers staff and players are often amazed by his ‘brave’ wardrobe choices when he arrives for work at the club’s Chadwell Heath training ground.

Not that it bothers the on-loan Barcelona man one bit.

The 27-year-old admits that some of his teammates tease him for being 'crazy' when it come to clothes

‘Everyone who knows me really well knows that I love clothes and to dress well,’ says Song as he switches back into his clothing.

It's a lot tamer than some of his previous clobber, but the casual two-tone leather and wool hoody is nevertheless eye-catching with its mix of short and long black laced tassles.

‘Some players were laughing at my jacket today,' he says. 'But it’s me. I like it because it’s short and long. They still say to me “Are you crazy!” That’s me. I’m an extravagant guy in the way I dress. I’ll never change.’

Song even has his own fashion label - Systeme Tchakap. It refers to an African way of life, living with a certain freedom and independence.

‘This hat is my own brand,’ says Songs as he leans forward to run his fingers across the synthetic peak front of his black snapback hat which is embossed with the brand name in red.

‘I sell it in some shops but mainly on the internet.’

This particular cap retails at £45 and it is so popular it is out of stock.

And it doesn’t take long to figure out why when superstars like Lionel Messi and Neymar are pictured proudly showcasing his designs.

Song expresses his love for fashion on the pitch too. He even rolls his shorts up to create the look of a throwback 1980s footballer.

‘I used to have it like that at Arsenal,’ he says.

‘It’s my own style and I like to do it. I feel good when I do it and when I play I’m very happy.’

West Ham’s current feelgood factor is a bit of a throwback to the famous Boys of ’86 era, when John Lyall’s side finished third in the old First Division.

And it’s no coincidence that their transformation this season has been heralded by Song’s arrival.

West Ham have risen to a surprising fifth in the Premier League table since Song's arrival at Upton Park

West Ham fans have pleaded with co-owner David Sullivan to make Song's loan deal permanent

In seven Premier League games with the former Arsenal ace at the heartbeat of the Hammers midfield, Sam Allardyce’s side have won four, drawn two and lost one, unexpectedly elevating them to fifth place.

Red-hot strikers Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia have deservedly taken a most of the acclaim, having hit the back of the net nine times between them.

But Song has enthralled his admirers with a succession of indomitable displays in midfield. In the 2-1 win over Manchester City a fortnight ago, he outclassed Yaya Toure. He even had the audacity to pull off a rabona against the champions.

‘It comes naturally,’ he laughs. ‘I’m looking to try it to make people happy but I’m mainly looking to try it to create a good opportunity.’

Inevitably, Song’s impressive start to the season has raised questions over his future. Co-chairman David Gold has been inundated with Twitter messages from supporters, urging him to make the transfer permanent. He agrees and insists discussions will take place.

The tough tackling midfielder learned his trade under Arsene Wenger at Arsenal

Naturally, Song takes it all in his stride and goes about his business as usual.

Like his dress sense, things are a lot different at West Ham to what he has been used to over the past two years with Messi and Co in Catalonia. But he is very happy.

‘It’s a different way to when I was playing at Arsenal and Barcelona,’ he admits

‘I’ve had a great opportunity to play for those two big clubs and again here at West Ham.

‘But I know it’s a different way. The first time I spoke to the Gaffer [Sam Allardyce] when I was about to sign, I was telling him that I like to play football. For me if I come from one team and the people don’t play football. I would be lost.

‘Sam said, “Don’t worry you’ll come here and see how we are playing”. I’m very happy because he gives us the opportunity to play.

‘I know we are not like Barcelona but we can play. And I like to play – when I have the ball, I don’t want to just put the ball away. I prefer to keep it, take my time and give the right ball in the right moment. And that’s what I want to do to help the team.’

Sam Allardyce, who picked up October's Manager of the Month, convinced Song to come to east London

Song is not one to take all of the credit, however. He identifies the likes of Sakho, Valencia and Stewart Downing for their part in West Ham’s upturn.

Full interview in the official match programme

‘West Ham do have very good players,’ he says.

‘The difference at Barcelona is that they are the best players in the world and, of course, that makes a big difference.

‘I try to bring my experience and the things I learned at Barcelona and at Arsenal to try and help the team.

“We are trying to play the best football we can play and make the fans very happy.’

And they are very happy right now. The boo boys have disappeared and some are even daring to dream of Champions League football. ‘Why not?’ Song smiles.

‘For me, I believe we can catch Europe this year,’ he adds, still content after last weekend’s two-goal turnaround at Stoke where West Ham snatched a point.

‘But the best thing for us to do is to take it game-by-game. Today, we play Villa at home and we have to make sure we do not lose it.

‘We can’t look at where Villa are at the moment. We know that Villa is a good team and they will come here to try and get a good result.

‘We can’t think because we won against Manchester City and Liverpool that Villa will be easy. No. They have good players and we have respect for them.

‘We’ll do everything we can to win that game because it’s very important to get the three points at home.’

Song insists he will get better and better for West Ham this season once he regains full fitness

As Song straightens up his cap to conclude our chat, he warns that West Ham fans haven't seen the best of him yet.

'At the moment, I’m not fit like I want to be,’ he confesses.

‘I have a little bit of a problem with my knee. I can't train like I want to. Hopefully soon that will be finished. And when I’m not starting to feel nothing you will see more from me.

'I know I can do more.’

To paraphrase a slogan on one of his t-shirts, Song may not feel he is perfect but he is a limited edition.
