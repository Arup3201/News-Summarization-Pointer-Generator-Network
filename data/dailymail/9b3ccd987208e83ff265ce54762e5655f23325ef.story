Urban Outfitters' latest t-shirt has created a stir for all the wrong reasons, as the sign on the front looks uncomfortably similar to a gang symbol.

The Vanguard Pitchfork t-shirt looks similar to a gang sign for the the Chicago-based Gangster Disciples that began in the 1960s.

Urban Outfitters prides itself on its edgy clothing but it may have crossed the line with this t-shirt.

As a major urban gang, the Gangster Disciples are thought to be responsible for many murders in Chicago.

US website All Voices has already called for Urban Outfitters to 'pull the offending shirt'.

Only last week, Senator Mark Kirk called for all 18,000 members of the gang to be arrested: 'I think itâ€™s completely within the capability of the United States government to crush a major urban gang,' he told a news conference.

Police estimate that as many as 100 of the 392 homicide victims last year were connected to the Gangster Disciples.

The origins of the Gangster Disciples go back to the 1960s, and it became a major force under the leadership of Larry Hoover in the 1970s.

By January this year, the homicide rate spiked to 43 - making the city even more dangerous than when mobster Al Capone ruled the streets.

Two alleged members who have been 
charged with the murder of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old schoolgirl 
who was gunned down in Chicago in January - just a week after she performed at 
President Obama's inaugural events.

Police said gang members were at the park where Hadiya was killed but that she was not a gang member.

It is not clear whether Urban Outfitters knowingly invoked the symbol of the gang or whether it was an unwitting mistake.

Either way it could cause them a lot of trouble.

Rapper Rick Ross was forced to cancel several concert dates after the Gangster Disciples threatened to crash two North Carolina shows in retaliation for him allegedly using the gang's logo for his mixtape 'Black Bar Mitzvah'.

Tragic: Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson lost three members of her family, including her nephew, Julian, in a triple homicide by a Gangster Disciples member in 2008

No one from the company was available to comment.

However, it was no longer possible to purchase the t-shirt on the website today.

On the website it is simply described as: 'A perfectly soft tee topped with a "Fork" graphic'.
