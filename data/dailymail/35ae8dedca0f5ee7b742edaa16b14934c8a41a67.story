An annual survey that measures Americans' sense of well-being has revealed that North Dakota and not longtime frontrunner Hawaii is the state with the most contented people.The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index showed that in 2013, North Dakota scored highest, followed closely by its southern neighbor South Dakota.Hawaii trailed the Upper Midwestern states in eighth place, while for the fifth year in a row West Virginia and Kentucky had the two lowest scores.

The art of happiness: The northern green states are in the top quintile for well-being, while the states in red are at the bottom

The poll is based on six sub-indexes: life evaluation, emotional health, work environment, physical health, healthy behaviors and basic access (to services such as healthcare).

North Dakota ranked only 19th in the last poll, and South Dakota came in 12th.

So how did the Dakotas move so far up in the rankings in just one year?

According to Gallup, North Dakota also ranked top in two sub-indexes: work environment and physical health.

What a difference a year makes: Some states made remarkable progress from 2012 to 2013, but the bottom three remained the same

North Dakota has experienced a boom in the job sector and topped all other states in employee perceptions of job creation at their workplace, according to Gallup's Job Creation Index.

South Dakota ranked third for job creation.

The happiness index is based on more than 178,000 interviews of American adults in all 50 states between January and December 2013.

Rounding out the top 10 were Nebraska in third, followed by Minnesota, Montana, Vermont, Colorado, Hawaii, Washington and Iowa.

1. North Dakota 70.42. South Dakota 703. Nebraska 69.74. Minnesota 69.75. Montana 69.36. Vermont 69.17. Colorado 68.98. Hawaii 68.49. Washington 68.310. Iowa 68.2

41. Louisiana 64.942. Oklahoma 64.743. Missouri 64.544. Tennessee 64.345. Arkansas 64.346. Ohio 64.247. Alabama 64.148. Mississippi 63-749. Kentucky 6350. West Virginia 61.4

The bottom 10 states represent much of the South, with Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi and Kentucky all in the bottom 10.

Kentucky and West Virgina, ranked 49th and 50th respectively, have scored bottom for the past five years.

People in those states reported poorer physical health and lower incomes.

According to Gallup, characteristics that are a common feature of highly ranked states are people who learn new and interesting things daily, who have safe places to exercise and who have fulfilling jobs with growth prospects.
