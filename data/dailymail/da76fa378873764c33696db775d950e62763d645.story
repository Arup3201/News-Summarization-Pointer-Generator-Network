An Australian man could be detained by Indonesian police for two months without charge over a motorbike crash that killed a woman who was riding with her daughter on Monday.

Jake Drage is in police custody while the accident is fully investigated, West Java police, in Bali's west, said on Friday.

The Western Australian 23-year-old is being assisted by consular officials, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says.

Jake Drage, from Western Australia, could be detained by Indonesian police for two months without charge over a motorbike crash that killed a woman who was riding with her daughter on Monday

Traffic officer Indra Darmaputra said the victim's family had produced a letter saying they didn't want the Australian charged.

But that didn't close the investigation.

'A settlement letter can't abolish a crime, it's only a factor for leniency before the court,' he said.

'Operationally, we must work based on the law.'

The officer was not authorised to discuss the possibility of bail.

The West Australian reported that Mr Drage pleaded his innocence on his Facebook page, claiming he is being held in jail near small West Java town Cimaja against the wishes of the family of the deceased.

'The police are holding me. I was awoken in a room, forced to sign some papers and was taken to another room. Something really dodgy is going on,' he said.

Mr Drage, from Geraldton - north of Perth, also wrote that he wasn't driving dangerously nor was he intoxicated.

Mr Drage's mother Tiena Drage posted on Facebook on Thursday that the Australian Embassy had said her son hadn't been formally charged or arrested.

'They are just "keeping" him for now,' she wrote.

'The embassy staff will visit him tomorrow mainly to see how he is being treated and his well being.

'Will know more then.'

Ms Drage has told local news website Everything Geraldton about the events before her son's accident on Monday.

She said he was facing uphill behind a small truck when he tried to see if it was safe to pass.

'All of a sudden a motorbike with two people on it was there and clipped Jake's bike.

'The bike was being driven by a 16-year-old girl, and her mother was on the back not wearing a helmet.'

The woman died the next day in hospital.

An online appeal was launched on Wednesday to raise $5000 to help bring Mr Drage back home.

So far more than $1000 has been raised for Mr Drage.

'Our fun and kind-hearted Jake had been living his dream when a few days ago it all came crashing down,' friend Melissa Dowling wrote.

'We would like everyone to dig deep to help Jake.

'Please note that the family of the deceased have also tried to help Jake. They know he is not to blame.'

His mother arrives in Indonesia on Saturday when she will begin speaking with lawyers.
