Tickets for last night’s sell-out London fireworks spectacular were being touted for £150 by a party organiser acquaintance of Prince Harry.

The official tickets costing £10 were snapped up weeks ago, but Brazilian student Fellipe Trindade was offering some for 15 times their face value – claiming he had obtained them through British embassy contacts.

The 22-year-old, who helped organise two official parties for Prince Harry, said his tickets were ‘special’ ones which permitted entry ‘as a guest of Mayor’ Boris Johnson.

He boasted to a prospective buyer: ‘We are selling to make some money so I want to know how much you guys are willing to pay.

‘The Mayor of London had a few tickets that he gave to some embassies. As we work for the British consulate [in Sao Paulo] we made some arrangements and they gave us tickets.’

The New Year fireworks display, which lights up the Thames, has become massively popular, attracting a crowd of half a million people last year.

This year, it was made ticket-only because of concerns about public safety, but critics warned that touts would try to take advantage.

To combat touting, Mr Johnson ordered that all tickets should have the name of the purchaser printed on them, which would be checked against the holder’s ID before they were allowed entry.

Mr Trindade, who was offering the tickets on Facebook, said that ‘the best thing of my ticket is they don’t have name as a guest of mayor [sic]’, adding: ‘It is a special ticket I got for working at the British Embassy.’

He met Harry in Sao Paulo in March 2012 when he was on the organising committee for a polo dinner held in aid of the Prince’s Sentebale charity. Then last summer, during the football World Cup in Brazil, he was a guest at a party to celebrate the Queen’s birthday hosted by the British ambassador and attended by Prince Harry. Mr Trindade initially claimed he had obtained his fireworks tickets through his connections with the British Embassy in the capital, Brasilia. But he later said he was selling them for a friend who had ‘won them in a radio competition’.

He promised buyers he would be able to register their names on the tickets.

Last night, he said he had simply given them away in the end.

The Mayor’s office denied that special tickets had been given to British embassies, and the Foreign Office said it was not aware of any.

A spokesman for the Mayor said: ‘What he is suggesting is impossible as all the tickets were printed with the purchaser’s name on them and posted to people. They also contain holographic stamps which cannot be printed out.

‘Touting isn’t illegal, but we’ve gone to great lengths to prevent touting and second selling, and have been encouraging people not to buy tickets from unofficial sites.

‘This looks like a scam and it’s simply wrong to suggest the Mayor gave away a small number of tickets. He had no tickets to give away.

‘This man’s claims are completely false and we do not believe he possesses genuine tickets to the event.’

Official tickets for last night’s fireworks sold out by December 16, and were being unofficially re-sold for up to £247 on ticket websites.

Previously, the event was free but its popularity put too much of a strain on transport and safety, organisers said.

Last night barriers were used to form three official viewing areas for the fireworks – on Westminster Bridge, on the north embankment of the Thames between Westminster and Waterloo bridges and on the Southbank behind the London Eye – with stewards controlling entry by checking tickets and ID.

Hundreds of revellers complained on Twitter about the fee, with one writing: ‘£10 just to look at the sky? No thanks.’

A spokesman for Prince Harry declined to comment.
