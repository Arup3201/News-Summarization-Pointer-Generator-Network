Twilight world: Hollywood studios should be forced to add condoms to sex scenes to make teenagers have safe sex, a researcher has said

Hollywood studios should be forced to add condoms to sex scenes to make teenagers have safe sex, a researcher has said.

Teenagers often use sex scenes in films as a 'script' for their real-life sex - but Hollywood films tend to portray condoms as comical.

A researcher found that watching screen sex led teenagers to use condoms less - and called for regulation.

‘One important observation from our evaluation of the films was that few showed contraceptive use or safe sexual practices,’ researcher Ross O’Hara from the 
University of Missouri said.

‘When safe sex is portrayed in films, it is often in comedies and is presented as an inconvenience or embarrassment.

'The motion picture industry could make an effort to show healthier, safer behaviors, just as they have reduced the amount of smoking shown in films.’

Watching sex scenes in movies can make children more sexually active from a younger age, research suggests.

Watching sex on screen also makes teenagers less likely to use condoms, said O'Hara.

Around 84% of current Hollywood films contain sex - including series aimed at teenagers such as the Twilight films.

Take more risks: Watching sex on screen can influence a child's personality and make them more prone to take risks

The scenes can 'fundamentally influence a teenager's personality’ and make them more prone to take risks he said.

Dr
O'Hara said: ‘Adolescents who are exposed to more sexual content in 
movies start having sex at younger ages, have more sexual partners and 
are less likely to use condoms with casual sexual partners.

While there’s been much research into the influence of drinking and smoking in movies, sex scenes has been overlooked.

Dr O’Hara said: ‘Much research has shown that adolescents’ sexual attitudes and behaviours are influenced by media.

'Sexual scripts': Teenagers look to films to work out how to behave in complex situations and don't differentiate between what's on the screen and daily life

 A survey of movies from 1950-2006 found that 84 per cent of movies contain sexual content.

Sexual content was found in:

‘But the role of movies has been somewhat neglected, despite other findings that movies are more influential than TV or music.’

Psychologists studied children aged 12 to 14 and then reviewed their sexual behaviour six years on.

The research, published in Psychological Science, followed 1,228 children over the six year period.

Dr O’Hara said adolescents often have
a predisposition for ‘sensation seeking’ behaviour, which peaks between
the ages of ten and 15, and leads to a tendency to seek more novel 
and intense stimulation of all kinds.

His
team found that greater exposure to sexual content in movies at a young
age actually led to a higher peak in sensation seeking during 
adolescence. 

The sensation
seeking behaviour could last well into the late teens and early 
twenties if young people were exposed to movie sex scenes Dr O’Hara 
said.

He said: ‘These 
movies appear to fundamentally influence their personality through 
changes in sensation seeking, which has far reaching implications for 
all of their risk taking behaviours.’

Teenagers
could also learn ‘sexual scripts’ from the films, using them as 
examples of how to behave when confronted with complex emotional 
situations.

Restricted viewing: While movies like Titanic seem harmless, with scenes like this one between Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet, parents must restrict their children's viewing

Given that for 
57 per cent of American adolescents between the ages of 14 and 16, the 
media is their greatest source of sexual information, they often don’t 
differentiate between what they see on the screen and what they must 
confront in daily life, Dr O’Hara said.

The researchers also looked at 684 
high grossing films and analysed them for sexual content, such as heavy 
kissing or actual sex.

Most of the recent films did not portray safe sex, with little mention of using contraception.

Each teenager identified which movies they had seen from a list of 50, randomly selected. 

Six
years later the teenagers were surveyed to find out how old they were 
when they became sexually active and how risky their sexual behaviour 
might have been.

They were also asked if they used condoms consistently and whether they had multiple sexual partners.

The findings revealed the link between exposure to sex on screen and sexual behaviour.

Dr
O'Hara said: ‘This study, and its confluence with other work, strongly 
suggests that parents need to restrict their children from seeing sexual
content in movies at young ages.’
