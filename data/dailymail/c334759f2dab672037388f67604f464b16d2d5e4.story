Action: More men should work part-time to end the stigma that blights many women's careers when they switch from full-time work, an academic claims

More men should work part-time to end the stigma that blights many women’s careers when they switch from full-time work, a leading academic will say today.

Dr Tom Schuller slammed a culture in which too many able and well-qualified women are ‘under-promoted and under-paid’ in their jobs.

He has coined the term the ‘Paula Principle’, which states that most women work at below their level of competence - that is, doing less than they are really capable of doing.

It is the opposite of the ‘Peter Principle’, dreamed up in the Sixties, which states that men are typically ‘promoted to their level of incompetence’.

That is, a man continues to be promoted until he is doing a job poorly enough not to be promoted any further.

Dr Schuller, a visiting professor at the University of London’s Institute of Education, said: ‘Many women are consequently working below their true level of competence.’

He said there are many reasons for this widespread problem, which affects women in many different types of careers in Britain.

While some women choose not to be promoted, others are held back by ‘covert or overt’ discrimination, a lack of self-confidence and insufficient contact with a senior manager who can mentor them.

Another major hurdle for women is their caring responsibility, not just for their young children but also for their elderly parents who can need as much help as a newborn baby.

Around 2.2 million men work part-time in Britain, according to the Office for National Statistics. They are over-shadowed by an army of six million women working part-time.

Dr Schuller said there is a widely-held view that anyone working part-time is ‘not serious about their work and not serious about their career.’

He warned: ‘This will only really change when more men work part-time or do not stick to the conventional model of a continuous, full-time career.’

Dr Schuller, who is speaking on the issue in London tonight, said: ‘Men’s career patterns will need to change too. Too much of the emphasis on gender equality involves helping women to work more like men.

‘It is time to enable more men to work in ways that are currently the preserve of women.

‘Men need to stop thinking about a career only in terms of continuously moving up a vertical ladder and think positively about lateral moves, perhaps working part-time.

‘Above all, choosing work which uses their competences but does not go beyond them.’

Widespread problem: Dr Schuller believes many women are working 'below their true level of competence'

It comes after a report, published last 
year, found the majority of mothers have never been promoted since they 
switched to working part-time after the birth of their children.

The report highlights the career crisis 
facing mothers around Britain, many of whom say they feel ‘trapped’ in 
jobs for which they are ‘over-qualified’ and ‘over-skilled’.

Around 1,000 people who work 30 hours or less a week - eight in ten of them women - were asked: ‘Since working part-time, have you been promoted?’

In a sign of the dead end which part-time work represents for many women, a staggering 73 per cent said they had never been promoted since switching to a part-time job.

The independent research, commissioned by the flexible working champions The Timewise Foundation, only looked at part-time workers with well-paid jobs which pay up to £100,000 a year on a full-time equivalent basis.

Karen Mattison, founder of Timewise and a mother of three boys herself, said: ‘Millions are hitting a wall at key points in their careers when they want to progress or move to a new role.

‘Doing so, without losing their flexibility, presents a real challenge, leaving many feeling trapped in their current jobs.’

She urged high-powered women who work part-time to speak more openly about their jobs, rather than keeping ‘under the radar’, and for firms to advertise if a job could offer flexible hours.

She said: ‘Many women worry about being seen as less ambitious and less committed if they reveal they work part-time. The word ‘part-time’ is seen negatively.

‘It is seen as a different track that you are going on - the ‘mummy track’.’

Mrs Mattison said one mother was told to leave her cardigan on her chair on her day off to pretend she was working.

A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: ‘It is simply bad business sense to overlook women’s skills in the workplace.

‘The key to ensuring we can continue the economic recovery is ensuring everyone can contribute fully at work, and that means ensuring the workplace is modernised to enable that.’
