The frantic cries of the Florida mother mauled by a 200-pound black bear over the weekend can be heard in the background of a 911 call as her distressed son phones for help.

Teri Frana's harrowing screams ring out as her teenage son tells a Seminole County Sheriff's dispatcher that, 'I need help in my house, a bear attacked my mom'.

The dramatic recording was released on Tuesday afternoon following Frana's terrifying encounter with five bears in her garage which left her needing 30 staples in her scalp and 10 stitches to her forehead.

Scary: Terri Frana broke down in tears during an interview on Monday and on Wednesday the 911 call her husband and son made was released by authorities

Jaws: The mother showed the cameras how the bear launched its jaws around her head and clamped them down

During the course of the call, the victim's husband, Frank Frana, calmly takes over the phone from his son.

'She's awake. She's breathing. She's just traumatized. She's breathing and she's bleeding hard,' he said according to the Orlando Sentinel.

'Do you have an ambulance dispatched?'

Frana thought the bear was trying to drag her into the woods and since the incident Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission have shot dead seven bears around her home.

In an interview on Monday, the terrified mother said that the bears reacted too fast for her when she stepped outside and as she was mauled she pleaded for help, screaming, 'Please, my kids need me.'

Frana, told NBC's Today show that the frightening encounter has left her very shaken.

'I can't close my eyes and not think about it, see it, feel it, but that will go away in time and I'm here,’ said Frana.

'I'm here for my kids.'

Frana said she stepped outside to get her children, who had been playing on their bikes when she was charged by the bears.

'I saw this large bear charging at me,’ she said to the Today show.

'She opened her jaw and clamped down onto my head, and I could just hear her teeth marks going through my scalp.'

Wounds: Frana showed the cameras how lucky she was to escape crippling injury after the bear mauling on Saturday

Frana revealed she could only think about her family during the bloody attack.

'I said, ‘Please, my kids need me,' she recalled.

Amazingly, Frana managed to escape the attack and drag herself inside her home where she was found by her eldest son, Drew, 15, who called 911.

Despite living in the neighborhood for 10 years, Frana feels that she and her family obviously became complacent about the threat posed by black bears.

'Unfortunately, we just got too comfortable with them being around,’ she said.

Indeed, the number of reports of people coming into contact with black bears in central Florida have more than doubled from just under a thousand in 2009 to more than 2,200 last year.

Frana's husband, Frank, said that he was just lucky to still have his wife with him after the attack.

'One of the bears stood up, knocked her down and started to maul her,' Frank Frana, the woman's husband, said according to MyFoxOrlando.com. 'The bear actually had my wife's head in its mouth and started to drag her towards the woods.'

Mrs. Frana was mauled and clawed but managed to escape, running back into her house to get her husband.

They called 911 and she was taken to hospital with wounds to her head, face, legs and torso.

The attack in Lake Mary, Florida, just north of Orlando, happened just 10 miles from another bear mauling where a woman was jumped upon whilst walking her dogs home.

Officials say the mother of four received bite marks to her shoulders, arms and upper thigh. Doctors also placed some 30 staples in her head and 10 stitches to cover up other lacerations.

The attack happened inside the Carisbrooke subdivision at a home on Brackenhurst Place on Saturday night.

Seminole County Sheriff Lt. Pete Brenenstuhl said that the woman was set upon by five bears ‘of various sizes’, suggesting it was a family of the animals.

He said the bears pounced on her the moment they saw her and ‘dragged her from inside the garage out into her driveway’.

Florida Fish and Wildlife officials are looking for the 200-pound black bear who attacked Mrs. Frana.

Several traps have been placed in the neighborhood in hopes of catching the bear. Wildlife officials are also out with tranquilizers, but say most bears are trapped at night.

On Sunday, officials shot a bear that was aggressive toward them in the area where the attack happened, Bay News9 reported.

They shot the bear at close range because it came up to them. Three other bears were captured and euthanized, while two more ran away.

Wildlife officials said that at this time of year bears were more likely to be scavenging for food and that residents should be on the lookout.

In December, Susan Chalfant suffered serious head injuries after a bear ‘came out of nowhere’ and jumped on her as she walked with her dogs in Longwood.

It was the worst bear attack ever recorded in Florida and left the 54-year-old covered in blood and with facial injuries that were so bad a neighbor hardly recognized her.

She later told wildlife investigators: ‘That bear was trying to kill me. It just kept coming’.

In January two Scottish tourists were attacked by a bear whilst on holiday in California after they walked straight past the animal oblivious to its presence.

Bob and Irene McKeown did not see the black bear as they exited their daughter’s house even though it was just 10ft away from them.

It followed them to their car where it clawed Mr McKeown who had just put his wife in the vehicle.

Wildlife officials said that the animal could have been looking for food.

Urban sprawl has meant that towns are taking up ever more of the land where bears live - and their numbers are increasing too.

In the 1970s an estimated 300 wild black bears were in Florida but that number stood at 3,000 in 2002, the most recent survey.

Researchers believe there could be as many as 5,000 now.
