High heels may make you feel sexy but — and it’s a big but — they often fail the most basic of shoe requirements: to get you from A to B.

According to top shoe designer Penelope Chilvers, whose fans include the Duchess of Cambridge, Cate Blanchett, Elle Macpherson and Claudia Schiffer, there’s a radical solution: ditch heels, because flat shoes can actually look far better.

And she knows what she’s talking about: Penelope was the designer who finally got Kate out of her famous LK Bennett nude heels and into a pair of tasselled Spanish riding boots.

‘You simply walk taller in flats,’ Penelope says. ‘You feel comfortable in them, so you’re able to walk with more confidence, keeping your spine straight, so giving you better posture.

‘Plus, they work for every occasion; I’m 5ft 2in and I wear them everywhere — even to weddings.’

To show just how versatile flats can be, here Penelope picks some of the best designs around this season and matches them with the outfits that show them off best . . .

CANKLE HIDERS 

The height of these boots is perfect to hide a cankle — where the calf looks a similar thickness to the ankle. The stretch panel makes them easy to pull on, and means you have a bit of give for comfort.

They have a small, 5cm heel that lifts you very slightly, but means you can still leap about. Wear them with jeans, trousers, skirts just below the knee or maxi dresses.

SUPER SPARKLES 

Skyscrapers aren’t the only way to make a statement after dusk. These metallic flats from Boden are covered in jewels and are beautifully elegant, thanks to the pointed toe. They will look fabulous against a tan, and work just as well during the day as at evening events. Wear with a statement necklace to sparkle from head to toe.

WORK WONDERS 

You don’t need to wear heels with a formal work outfit to look feminine — just pick flats with the right details.

Look out for gems, bright colours and unusual shapes. This great pair of patent pumps are slick and chic with a very slight gold heel, which will give you a lift, while still being practical.

They are smart enough for work, but still feminine, thanks to the front bow detail. Burgundy will be one of the colours this winter, and looks great against black and grey.

SUPPORT ACT 

Most people opt for ballet pumps when dressing down. But slippers, with a leather sole and slightly higher heel, are a better, more supportive option.

These smoking slippers are velvet with a leather tassel and look smart, yet relaxed. A V&A exhibition about Oscar Wilde, among others, inspired me to design them. Worn with or without socks, they are a useful, neutral shoe that should match with most of your wardrobe — yes, they’re more expensive, but they’ll last you a lifetime.

SHORT AND SWEET 

A pale pink or nude shoe lengthens the appearance of your legs, unlike black or coloured shoes, which seem to cut you off at the ankle.

These have a small heel in the same colour as the body of the shoe to give subtle height without being noticeable or uncomfortable.

Simple flats, like these, look good next to a print dress as they let it do the talking.

SAY 'I DO!' 

We think of weddings and assume we should wear heels. Why, though, when we will be on our feet all day?

Embellished sandals can look just as good and are formal enough for the occasion, so long as you take care to look after your toes. A pedicure is essential. Again, pair with a statement necklace.
