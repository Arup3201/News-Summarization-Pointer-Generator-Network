Bill Ryan has been arrested for protesting the Whitehaven coalmine in northern NSW

When Bill Ryan was 20 years old he fought for Australia in the Kokoda campaign.

This year, at the age of 92, Mr Ryan was arrested for protesting a coalmine in northern NSW, work he believes is an extension of the fight to safeguard Australia's future he participated in New Guinea in World War II.

'I think it's a continuation. If we don't defend our farms, our water, our land and let it be destroyed - I can't find the word to say -  we're negligent,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'If it was worth saving one time, it's worth saving now.'

Mr Ryan, a great-grandfather, was arrested in April and fined $600 for blockading the roads leading to the Whitehaven coalmine in Maules Creek, northern NSW, with a group of 150 protesters.

The protester's objections to the mine range from concerns about endangered flora and fauna, the fact the forest is home to 2,153 hectares of endangered Box Gum trees, the cultural significance of the area to Aboriginal people, as well as the potential impact on the surrounding farmland, which is a key food bowl in NSW.

For Mr Ryan is particularly concerned about the impact the coalmine will have on global warming.

A report by Dr Ian Lowe, Emeritus Professor at Griffith University and president of the Australian Conservation Foundation, estimated the mine would produce 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, roughly the same as the amount of fossil fuels produced annually by New Zealand.

'All this information is coming from global specialists that if we don't do anything about [global warming], it would have catastrophic consequences for our grandchildren,' said Mr Ryan.

Mr Ryan, who has two grandchildren and one great-grandchild, a three-year-old great-granddaughter named Amber, said he worries about the future they face.

'What is it going to be? When I grew up we didn't have any worries like this, there was none of this pollution they talk about today. I don't think we – the grandparents and parents – should leave that to them, we felt we had to do something.'

In the last five years, since Mr Ryan became convinced that the Australian government would not take a firm stance on global warming, Mr Ryan has joined his local Climate Action group in the Sutherland Shire of Sydney, blocked a railway line to stop coal trains coming into Newcastle, joined a group blockading the entrance to Parliament House, participated in mass demonstrations in Canberra, and written to MPs.

'Our politicians have let us down and have sold out to mining interest and the people have to take some action themselves,' he said.

The arrest in April was for trespass and resulted in a $600 fine for the great-grandfather

The coal mining industry accounted for more than $38 billion of export earnings in Australia in 2012-13 and employs 54,000 people across the country.

Whitehaven Coal Managing Director Mr Paul Flynn called the Maules Creek project 'one of the most significant investments currently underway in regional NSW' employing 340 full-time staff during construction and 470 staff during ongoing operations.

He added that the project had received 'immense and very gratifying' regional support for the project.

Mr Ryan said that just because coal of the nation's key exports does not mean it does not cause social and environmental harm and he argues Australia should be investing in alternative energy forms.

'Just like we try to get people off smoking, we need to wean people off coal,' he said. 'The world is going over to renewables and Australia's sitting around with something they call direct action… We're in an ideal position to be a leader in the world, but with mining interest we're lagging behind. We've got to catch up with the rest of the world.'

Mr Ryan says he will continue to visit the Maules Creek site and that participating in the protests is not only a duty, but it keeps him young.

'I feel rejuvenated and I hate leaving [the protest site], leaving these people who put their lives on the line to stop global warming and defend the forests,' he said.

Mr Ryan has travelled up to join the protest camp six times over the last two years
