Louis van Gaal's pre-season got off to a flyer as United mauled LA Galaxy 7-0 on Wednesday.

However, they won't be joined on their tour by long-term midfield target Arturo Vidal.

Juventus' Chilean star was questioned about his future and replied: 'I do not go to Manchester.

'I’ll talk to Allegri on Monday and then we will see.

'I haven’t spoken with Allegri or any of my team-mates yet, but I’m not going to Manchester.'

United could face former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole when they face Roma tomorrow.

The left-back joined the Serie A side on a free transfer after Jose Mourinho failed to offer him a new contract.

He is understood to have taken a £160,00 a week pay cut to join the Italian giants but was lured by the opportunity of Champions League football.
