If your ancestors were members of the upper class, chances are you will be - even centuries after they've died. 

Researchers have found that a person's surname is a strong indicator of social status, going back  generations, and a status from years ago can still exert its influence on a person's life today.

In fact, the study found that social status is more consistently passed down among families over hundreds of years, than height.

The researchers analysed the surnames of students who attended Oxford (pictured) and Cambridge universities between 1170 and 2012 and rich property owners between 1236 and 1299. They found that a person's surname is a strong indicator of social status, going back multiple generations

The results were published by Gregory Clark from the University of California, Davis and Neil Cummins from the London School of Economics in the journal Human Nature.  

They used the Oxbridge attendance of people with rare English surnames to track social mobility from 1170 to 2012.

They discovered that social mobility in England has always been slow, and today it is not much greater than it was in pre-industrial times.

Social mobility is the movement of individuals, or families, between social classes.  

The researchers analysed the surnames of students who attended Oxford and Cambridge universities between 1170 and 2012, rich property owners between 1236 and 1299, as well as the national probate registry since 1858.  

These databases were used as they indicate that the people included on them are of a high social standing, as well as highly educated. 

The names on them were also cross-referenced with each other to get a wider, overall picture about a family's social standing.

Rare surnames studied included Atthill, Bunduck, Balfour, Bramston, Cheslyn, and Conyngham. 

They found that social status is consistently passed down among families over multiple generations.  

For example, members of the Bunduck family attended the universities consistently from the 12th century until the modern day - shown because their name regularly appeared on the register throughout. 

This suggests that the Bunducks of the 12th century had enough standing and intelligence to attend the university, but so did their ancestor's ancestors. 

The Bunducks were additionally found on the rich property owners' database, which also suggested they were of a higher class during the 13th century.

And again during the 19th century, as seen by the presence on the probate registry. 

Social status is generally seen as a ranking of families and is based on a variety of elements including education, their income, wealth, occupation, and health.

Mr Clark and Mr Cummings used databases to calculate the social trajectory of families with rare English surnames over the past 28 generations.

They analysed the surnames of students who attended Oxford and Cambridge universities between 1170 and 2012, rich property owners between 1236 and 1299, as well as the national probate registry since 1858.

These databases were used as they indicate that the people included on them are of a high social standing, as well as highly educated. 

The names on them were also cross-referenced with each to get a wider, overall picture about a family's social standing. 

Rare surnames studied included Atthill, Bunduck, Balfour, Bramston, Cheslyn, and Conyngham. 

The researchers chose rare surnames as it was more likely that the different records would refer to direct descendants.  

They found that social status is consistently passed down among families over multiple generations. 

For example, members of the Bunduck family attended the universities consistently from the 12th century until the modern day - shown because their name regularly appeared on the register throughout. 

This suggests that the Bunducks of the 12th century had enough standing and intelligence to attend the university, but so did their ancestor's ancestors. 

The Bunducks were additionally found on the rich property owners' database, which also suggested they were of a higher class.

'Strong forces of familial culture, social connections, and genetics must connect the generations,' said Mr Clark.

'Even more remarkable is the lack of a sign of any decline in status persistence across major institutional changes, such as the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century, the spread of universal schooling in the late nineteenth century, or the rise of the social democratic state in the twentieth century,' added Mr Cummins.

'Status persistence measured by education status is just as strong now as in the pre-industrial era.' 

They said their findings show there 'really are quasi-physical "Laws of Inheritance."'  

This chart plots the relative frequency of the selected surnames compared to their educational status. This is plotted against the general population and the elite groups over two different generations. The study found that social status is more consistently passed down among families over hundreds of years, than height
