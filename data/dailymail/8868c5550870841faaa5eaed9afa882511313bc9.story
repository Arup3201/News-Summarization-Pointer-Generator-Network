Eden Miranda (pictured) is still recovering from the car crash that left him orphaned last month

The nine-year-old boy left orphaned last month when his parents and siblings were killed by a drunk driver, still has no permanent home and is yet to recover from his injuries sustained.

Eden Miranda suffered head injuries, liver damage and broken legs in the horrific accident three weeks ago in Lodi, Northern California.

Despite venturing outside in his wheelchair for the first time this weekend and keeping up with schoolwork, he hasn't been told where he will permanently live, The Sacramento Bee reported.

Eden is currently staying with his 30-year-old uncle, Filipe Miranda, who said: 'We're waiting for his grandparents to come so we can have a dialogue that will determine what we will do.'

His school principal, Christine Malandro, spoke highly of the student and said of his progress: 'He's doing really well.

'He's very bright. He's a very resilient child. He just really wants to get back to school right away. That's his goal.'

Eden's father, Luis Miranda Ochoa, 32, mother Viviana Rodriguez Saldado, 31, who was seven months pregnant, and his three siblings, Irvin, 12, Jose, six and Stephanie, five, were all killed.

The drunk driver was ex-con Ryan Christopher Morales, 28, who was allegedly drinking vodka on the afternoon of October 22 before speeding in his SUV.

Morales was also injured in the accident but was arrested on Friday after being released from Lodi hospital.

He faces six counts of second degree murder and six counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. He is currently in San Joaquin County Jail.

Eden Miranda was listed in critical condition at University of California Davis Medical Center just three weeks ago in the aftermath of the deadly six-car collision in Lodi.

Lodi Unified Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education Catherine Pennington told Lodi News said that Eden's brother Irving Miranda attended Lodi Middle School, where he distinguished himself as a good student and an all-around well-liked boy.

Stephanie was enrolled in a kindergarten program in Heritage Primary Elementary School, where her brother Jose was a first-grader.

Police say an SUV driver reportedly 
drove through the intersection of Ham and Vine streets while on his cell 
phone and caused a six-car collision, leaving up to a dozen people 
injured. 

Eyewitness Erin Andrews told the Sacramento Bee that the brown SUV appeared to be doing about 100mph when it blew through a busy intersection, with the driver clutching a cell phone to his ear.

‘He looked angry, like he was on a mission,’ Andrews said.

The carnage that decimated the Miranda family left the local community reeling. About 250 people gathered at the debris-strewn site of the crash for an emotional vigil to remember the young victims and their parents after the incident.

Sabien Tafoya, 13, lit a candle for his friend Irving Miranda, describing him as a smart and funny boy who enjoyed making his friends laugh.

Lodi Middle School also held a moment of silence for the 11-year-old and his two younger siblings.

‘We’re trying not to forget a loving friend,’ 12-year-old Jason Ordinola, who was on the soccer team with Irving, told Lodi News.

A makeshift memorial had sprung up on the site of the crash, with sobbing relatives, friends and strangers leaving flowers, notes and stuffed animals in honor of the victims, News 10 reported.

Neighbors reported running from their homes after hearing the collision and seeing bodies - including those of children - in the road as emergency personnel arrived.

Five vehicles were involved in the crash, and several people were transported by air or ambulance to area hospitals, including St. Joseph’s Hospital in Stockton and UC Davis Medical Center.

Lodi Police Detective Eric Bradley told the Sentinel that three of the injured were in surgery after the accident.

Lodi, a city of more than 60,000 people, is about 35 miles south of Sacramento.
