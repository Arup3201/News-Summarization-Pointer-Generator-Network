Most parents these days are no strangers to snapping endless photos of their newborns but we'd hazard a guess that they'd love a few more snaps of them sleeping - not least because we all know a sleeping baby can be a rare thing.

And of course a sleeping baby can also be a very cute thing, as these adorable pictures show, especially within the first two weeks of their life when they are at their most teeny and delicate.

Because tiny babies have much more soft cartilage in their bones at first, they are still comfortable curling themselves into comfy, and very heart-string-pulling positions to be photographed while they have a little snooze.

So sweet: During the first two weeks of a baby's life they around 300 soft cartilage bones and are more comfortable getting into sleeping positions like this

Cute cook: Venture Photography, who took these pictures, say the first 14 days of a new-born's life are their most delicate

These beautiful pictures show sleeping babies that they have captured on camera within two weeks of being born.

During this time of their brand new lives, a baby has around 300 soft cartilage bones.

As they grow, these fuse together to make 206 bones.

As they have more of these soft cartilage bones in their first two weeks they are more comfortable to sleep with their legs tucked under their bottoms, mimicking the positions they took in the womb.

These compacted positions are very unique
 to the first 14 days, as after this period they get used to stretching 
out while sleeping in their cribs.

Cool: Says Venture, a baby has around 300 soft cartilage bones when they are born and, as they grow, these fuse together to make 206 bones

Double trouble: Parents should photograph babies with two weeks of them being born to capture their true delicacy, says Venture

All the images taken were from proud parents bringing in their new-borns to Venture studios across the UK so they could capture their first two weeks of life

Kiss from above: The first 14 days of a baby's life are also their most peaceful, therefore experts are able to take a great range of shots without making your baby uncomfortable

‘They no longer adopt the unique foetal positions showing how important it is to capture this limited moment in your baby’s life,’ says Richard Mayfield, Creative Director of Venture Photography.

‘We know how important those moments are.

'Just seeing the change in images people take with their smart phones over the weeks, it is clear how much your baby will grow and develop.’
