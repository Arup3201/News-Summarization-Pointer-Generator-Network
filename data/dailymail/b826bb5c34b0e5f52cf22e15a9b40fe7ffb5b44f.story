As his old side gears up to try and force further misery upon bitter rivals Liverpool, Rene Meulensteen has launched an astonishing attack on Louis van Gaal and his tenure at Manchester United.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Meulensteen, who was a coach at Old Trafford during Sir Alex Ferguson's era, blasted Van Gaal's personal skills and implied his fellow Dutchman has been fortunate with how results have panned out for him.

'We are nearly at Christmas now and look at the performances. I still don’t see a flow, a rhythm,' Meulensteen said. 'They win five on the spin but they were absolutely pummelled at Arsenal and should have lost against Southampton.

Louis van Gaal has also faced criticism from Gary Neville and Paul Scholes about his side's style of play

'He will blow up at some point. That’s part of his make-up. Remember these words.

'If you go and sit with Van Gaal, you’ll come out thinking ‘I’m 12 years old’. He will speak to you as if you have no clue. He will look at you and be thinking ‘what are you asking me? I’m Louis van Gaal’.

But while Meulensteen is not the biggest advocate of Van Gaal's techniques, he singled out Ryan Giggs' role as assistant manager as pivotal for United's future.

'I said to Ryan: ‘I’m so glad you’re staying at the club in this role because you’re the one holding on to this life-line to the Ferguson era but I’m telling you it’s going to be the most difficult three years ahead of you,’ Muelensteen said.

Criticism from some of Ferguson's most trusted men has started to rain down on Van Gaal recently, despite guiding United into third position in the Premier League.

Before Muelensteen spoke out,  Gary Neville compared United's defending to a pub team, while Paul Scholes raised fears that the best young talent in Manchester will be drawn to Manchester City after the Premier League champions unveiled a new £200million training complex. 

Van Gaal shrugged off the comments by saying they are based upon 'no facts', but he will hope that United can silence Meulensteen by compounding Liverpool's woes with  a winning result and a dominant performance at Old Trafford on Sunday.
