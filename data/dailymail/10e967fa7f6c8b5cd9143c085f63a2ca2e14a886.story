Drunken Cambridge University students in fancy dress ‘inundated’ an accident and emergency department making it difficult to treat other patients, a hospital has complained.

Doctors at Addenbrooke’s Hospital have written to the university to protest about the ‘disruptive’ behaviour of members of a college sports team.

They say the students, who were admitted in varying states of consciousness and with injuries from fights, wandered around the hospital and were rude to staff.

The trouble started at 6pm on Tuesday when students who were already extremely drunk started to arrive at the Cambridge hospital. It is believed the hospital continued to treat students until 4am.

Complaint: Staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital have complained to Cambridge University after its students 'inundated' the A&E unit, making it difficult for doctors to treat other patients

In a letter of complaint to the students’ college, the hospital wrote that ‘a selection of drunken students in fancy dress’ were admitted on ‘an already busy night’

It said that other patients were affected and complained as the ‘students and their friends were disruptive, rude and frequently had to be told to stop wandering between the different areas of the department as they shuttled between their friends in different cubicles.’

‘From what [hospital staff] could gather there had been either a rugby or rowing drinks event,’ it added.

The letter described some students as semi-comatose through alcohol and others with injuries consistent with fights.

Last night Cambridge University said that it was launching an investigation into the incident.

A spokesman said: ‘The University deplores this reported unacceptable behaviour. An investigation is under way.’

Dr Adrian Boyle, consultant at Addenbrooke’s A&E, said: ‘We can confirm that we have written to a Cambridge college to raise concerns about a small number of students who were behaving irresponsibly and causing operational difficulty in the Emergency Department.

‘This is a relatively unusual occurrence but it did cause problems for staff on the night in question.’

Students at Cambridge University have developed a reputation for their rowdy behaviour and heavy drinking, as well as their academic prowess.

In May, drunken students wrecked a curry house in the city when a mass brawl broke out between two rival groups.

More than a dozen students - many of them bare-chested - bombarded each other with food, plates and cutlery.

Some of the students used their shoes as missiles and a glass bottle hit a girl on the head.

A male student was thrown from his chair and pushed down the stairs and a table was broken in half.

There are several annual student rituals at the university that involve binge-drinking.

Caesarean Sunday is seen as the start of the drinking parties for the summer term.

It historically takes place at a park in Cambridge’s city centre, on the first bank holiday of the summer term.

Local residents have previously complained about students stripping off, vomiting and urinating in public.
