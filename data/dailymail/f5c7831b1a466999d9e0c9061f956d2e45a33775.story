Luis Suarez returns to Barcelona’s line-up on Wednesday for the club’s biggest game of the season so far. Both Barca and Atletico Madrid are facing the quarter-final second leg as if it were a final, and with good reason – with Real Madrid already out of the way whoever progresses will feel they have one hand on the Cup.

The winners of this tie, currently being led 1-0 by Barcelona, will face Villarreal or Getafe in the semi-final with one of Malaga, Sevilla, Espanyol and Athletic Bilbao awaiting them in the final.

Suarez could have his first silverware by May if Barca finish the job on Wednesday and the form book plays out in the remaining rounds. He was rested against Elche at the weekend but comes back into a game which Atletico Madrid must face without arguably their most important player Diego Godin. Suarez’s Uruguayan team-mate is suspended and so marking duties will switch to another of his compatriot - the 20-year-old Jose Gimenez.

Lionel Messi celebrates after scoring against Atletico Madrid int he quarter-final first leg

With five goals in 16 games Suarez has not had the goalscoring start many expected but he has already scored against Atletico this season in the 3-0 league win two weeks ago.

Barcelona are defending a 1-0 lead which means even a high-scoring defeat by a solitary goal will see them through. ‘People outside the dressing room might say we are favourites’ said Barca coach Luis Enrique. ‘But if we adopt that approach we will be making a big mistake. Of the three big teams left [in the competition] only one will still be standing but we have to make sure it is us.’

Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simone has done his best to convince his players a comeback is possible. ‘We have to live every minute as if it were the last,’ he said. He is expected to give Fernando Torres another chance to work his cup magic.

Fernando Torres played in the first leg and is also due to be handed a start on Wednesday evening 

'It was two goals from the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker that saw Atletico past Real Madrid in the last round.

The man who replaced him at Liverpool, Suarez, will be partnered by Neymar who has 19 goals already this season – four more than in the entire 2013-14 campaign. And Lionel Messi completes Barcelona’s formidable front three. The Argentine has scored 22 goals against Atletico in 24 matches. He has scored in his last five games and the team has scored 14 goals in their last three away games.

For an Atletico side who will also be without midfielder Koke, a comeback looks a tall order but Simone’s champions are never more dangerous than when they have been ruled out of contention – Enrique has done his best all week to make sure that has not happened.

ATLETICO MADRID: Oblak; Juanfran, Miranda, Gimenez, Siqueira; Raul Garcia, Gabi, Mario Suarez, Arda Turan; Torres, Griezmann.

BARCELONA: Ter Stegen; Alves, Pique, Mascherano, Alba; Rakitic, Busquets, Iniesta; Messi, Suarez, Neymar.
