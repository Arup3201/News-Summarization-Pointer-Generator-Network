This was a wedding Vienna will remember for years — however much it might want to forget it. The theme was pure Disney, with four white-plumed Lipizzan horses pulling a carriage containing the loving couple, who were separated by a mere 57 years.

As guests gathered last weekend in the 1,441-room Schonbrunn Palace for the lavish reception, the bride and groom released two symbolic white doves into the air.

The 24-year-old bride, former Playboy Bunny Cathy Schmitz, wore an explosion of purple and white chiffon over a jewelled strapless bustier, topped off with a white fur jacket.

Highest fee: Richard Lugner reportedly pay $500,000 to have Kim Kardashian attend as his date this year

Her groom, 81-year-old Austrian billionaire Richard Lugner, wore a top hat and an expression of sadness. To be fair, he always looks like that, having had plastic surgery on his eyelids in an attempt to look like George Clooney.

‘Apart from a big age difference, everything fits,’ he said of his fifth marriage. But aside from the glorious eccentricity of his latest nuptials, the union throws up a tantalising question: will the new Mrs Lugner put a stop to the oddest and tackiest date in the international showbusiness calendar?

Every year, her new husband — nicknamed ‘Concrete’ due to his roots in the building trade — famously bribes a glamorous and usually busty female celebrity to be his companion at the glittering Vienna Opera Ball.

If spending an evening being whirled around the dance floor by a doddery octogenarian with virtually no English, or sipping champagne with him in his private box, doesn’t sound seductive enough, the trip also includes an obligatory tour of his local shopping mall, Lugner City. How could any girl say no?

More shocking than his gall in trying to buttonhole the cream of Hollywood pulchritude is the fact that so many stars have actually said yes. And big names to boot.

Since the cheesy tradition started in 1991 with the voluptuous Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida, she was followed during the Nineties by Joan Collins, Sophia Loren, Raquel Welch, Grace Jones, Faye Dunaway and even Sarah, Duchess of York.

The following decade saw Jacqueline Bisset, Farrah Fawcett, Pamela Anderson, Paris Hilton and former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell take the Austrian’s not ungenerous schillings. 

Snooty Viennese society has attacked Mr Lugner as a flashy, publicity-obsessed parvenu who has brought Austria’s most prestigious social event into disrepute. There have been calls for the ‘ageing horny builder’, as one outraged grandee called him, to lose his box at the ball.

However, the eccentric Lugner — who has starred in his own TV reality show, formed his own political party and has gone to other balls in drag — is not at all daunted. Neither are the stars who continue to accept his invitations — and his money.

Over the years, the celebrity guests themselves have had little to say about their date with Lugner — but you can understand their reticence to discuss such shamelessly mercenary behaviour.

A seasoned ball observer yesterday compared it with the A-List Hollywood stars who sneak off to Tokyo to appear in tacky Japanese commercials for which they are paid fortunes — knowing they will never be seen in the U.S.

Of course, some of these world-famous women may be curious to attend the world’s most famous ball, held amid the splendour of chandeliers, gilded ceilings and marble statues in Vienna’s neo-Classical Opera House.

But the chief draw is invariably financial. Lugner pays a five or six-figure sum to his guest, as well as flying her and a few hangers-on to and from Vienna by private jet, and putting her up at a suite in one of the city’s most luxurious hotels.

This year, the fee reportedly rose as high as $500,000 when he paid reality TV phenomenon Kim Kardashian to attend — albeit with disastrous results, more of which later.

But in celebrity-starved Austria, Lugner strives to get his money’s worth by agreeing a contract which outlines his guest’s obligations to him.

They must accompany him to a pre-ball Press conference and spend a few hours signing autographs in his shopping mall, Lugner City. Joining him on the dance floor for the Blue Danube is not obligatory, although Mr Concrete makes it plain it would be appreciated.

Many stars, it seems, don’t play ball, doing the bare minimum contractually before they can flee back to London, New York or Los Angeles.

The Duchess of York, Lugner’s guest in 1997 for a reported $40,000 (a bargain compared to the $110,000 he reportedly paid for Sophia Loren two years earlier), did at least speak to the media at the ball.

‘It is wonderful to see all the men in their finery with their white ties on and listen to the excellent music,’ she told Austrian TV blandly.

Of course, she had debts to pay off at the time and a book to promote. Still, to sweeten the deal, Lugner paid for a three-room suite at Vienna’s lavish Imperial Hotel (where Adolf Hitler used to stay) and two stretch limos to ferry her around.

Of course, even when you’re showering money on stars you have to be prepared for prima donna behaviour. In 1993, Joan Collins reportedly demanded an American limousine and wanted special pencils for her autograph-signing session.

She stipulated that she wouldn’t be asked to sign any books that had been written by her sister, Jackie, and also asked for a wraparound table to hide her legs.

Lugner refused to comment on reports he had paid the actress £57,000. ‘I never talk about money,’ he said. ‘It isn’t nice for Miss Collins to read what she is getting.’

When Sharon Stone backed out of Lugner’s invitation to attend the 1996 ball, he recruited Amazonian singer Grace Jones at the last minute. She insisted on bringing along her boyfriend, and poor Mr Lugner didn’t get a look-in.

‘He makes too much love, this boyfriend, and Grace spends a lot of time with him,’ he griped later. ‘They make love also in the Opera House behind the curtains. I mean, we didn’t see. We heard.’

Lugner rarely criticises his companions, but occasionally feels moved to speak out. Geri Halliwell, who graced the ball in 2005, was a nightmare, he claimed. ‘Geri Halliwell was the most difficult. She even refused to do interviews,’ he said two years ago. 

'Joan Collins is a real-life beast, not just on TV. Grace Jones had sex — before the ball, during the ball and after the ball!’ 

Danish actress Brigitte Nielsen — ex-wife of Sylvester Stallone — was the ‘nicest’ guest he had ever had.

He also loves it when his guests are gracious enough to dance with him. Faye Dunaway and Grace Jones were ‘great dancers’, he recalled.

Other guests have complained of being treated like pieces of meat at the ball. Dita Von Teese, the burlesque dancer who accompanied him in 2008, complained that she was ‘trampled in a mob scene by the Press’, which was ‘very frightening’.

It’s fair to say Lugner isn’t the dish he may once have been. There have been unkind sneers about the declining calibre of stars he takes to the ball nowadays.

He also seems to be paying a lot more than he used to. But even trainwreck actress Lindsay Lohan didn’t manage to honour her reported $150,000 deal to attend in 2010. After missing the jet he’d laid on, she refused to take a scheduled flight or even share another private flight, and didn’t go.

The following year, he withdrew his invitation to actress Bo Derek after claiming she’d demanded $25,000 more than agreed. Lugner boasted he had 20 other candidates. Given he opted for Karima El Mahroug, the teenage dancer accused of being paid for sex by Silvio Berlusconi, one can only wonder what the rest were like.

After this year, those who say he is ruining the ball’s reputation have even more ammunition. After paying Kim Kardashian a small fortune to attend, Mr Lugner complained that she was ‘annoying’. She was ‘refusing to stick with the programme’ by going off to film her reality TV show at a local restaurant instead of being with him.

She even refused to dance with the old boy after he’d announced at a Press conference that she would. Instead, she offered her mother as a dancing partner.

The Kardashian camp told a different tale, saying Kim had fled the ball after being approached by a ‘blacked-up’ white man mimicking her now-husband, rapper Kanye West. It was also claimed that Kardashian felt Lugner was overly tactile, and asked her to dismiss her minders so they could be alone.

Perhaps, given such controversy, the fact that he is newly married might bring this eccentric annual tradition to an end — or perhaps there are some female celebrities left who still think an invitation from Mr Concrete is just too good to turn down.
