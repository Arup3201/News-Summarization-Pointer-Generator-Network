Rihanna has an army of stylists and designers desperate to dress her in bespoke creations, but even a superstar loves a bit of high street in their wardrobe.

It helps - of course - if they have designed it themselves.

And the navy blue jumpsuit she was been snapped in recently is the first piece we have seen from her hotly anticipated clothing line for River Island.

Rihanna was seen chatting on the phone on Sunday in a navy jumpsuit, which is actually from her upcoming line for River Island

Although the capsule collection for the high street store won't hit shops until Spring 2013, the star is already promoting her creative efforts.

Rumours were rife Rihanna was going 
to work with River Island after she was spotted visiting the chain's 
head office in London in March and the singer recently admitted she has wanted to 
become involved in fashion for a while.

Her recent 777 tour was partly sponsered by the brand, who sent a fleet of fashion journalists around the world on the private party jet.

River Island spokesmen have said the range will reflect her street style, which is clear to see

She said: 'I’ve been wanting to design my own collection for some time. River 
Island is the perfect partner for me to collaborate with and working 
with a British, family run business also really appealed to me. 

'I find 
London really inspiring and River Island loves to have fun with clothes.
I’m looking forward to working with them and creating something really 
special.'

River Island chief 
executive Ben Lewis said the range will reflect her 'street to chic' 
style which is clear to see from the latest photos of her wearing a piece from her collection.

Rihanna's capsule collection range will be in stores from spring 2013

He said: 'We are thrilled to be collaborating with Rihanna and to be the first fashion brand to work with her in this way.

'Rihanna
is a style icon, from street to chic she enjoys her fashion. As soon as
we started to work together we knew this was a perfect fit.

'Rihanna
will be designing the collection and we will be sharing our fashion 
experience with her to develop a range her fans will love.'
