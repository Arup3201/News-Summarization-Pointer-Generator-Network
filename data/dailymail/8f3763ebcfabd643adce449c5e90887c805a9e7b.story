Water hits nuclear plant in Nebraska but officials say there's 'no danger'

As the devastating floods peaked today it was revealed that most of the residents affected in Minot, North Dakota, don't have proper flood insurance.

The town has been decimated by the floods from the Souris River which slowly began to retreat today, although officials estimate it will be weeks before the river returns to a normal level.

At least 4,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods, the worst in the region for 130 years.

And most residents affected do not have the right kind of insurance, as they believed the flood prevention projects put in place after the last major flood in 1969 would protect them.

Today the town looked to recovery and 
FEMA said they will provide some assistance. North Dakota Legislature is
expected to offer some relief.

Meanwhile a protective barrier which 
was holding back floodwater from the Missouri River surrounding a nuclear power plant in 
Nebraska collapsed yesterday, sending water gushing around key 
electrical equipment.

The head of the U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission has been dispatched to the plant in Fort Calhoun, 
Nebraska, but officials said the public is in no danger.

After the 2,000-foot berm was breached
flood waters poured into around containment buildings forcing the 
shutdown of electrical power, and sparking fears that thousands could be
left without power - or face rising bills - if any damage is done.

Officials said backup generators are cooling the nuclear material, and that the plant has not operated since April. They said there is no danger to the public.

Jeff
Hanson, a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power District, said the 
breached berm wasn't critical to protecting the plant, although a crew 
will look at whether it can be patched.

Mr Hanson said: 'That was an additional layer of protection we put in.'

The berm's collapse didn't affect the 
reactor shutdown cooling or the spent fuel pool cooling, but the power 
supply was cut after water surrounded the main electrical transformers, 
the NRC said.

Emergency generators are powering the plant while workers try to restore power.

Flooding
remains a concern all along the Missouri because of massive amounts of 
water the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released from upstream 
reservoirs.

The river is expected to rise as much
as five to seven feet above flood stage in much of Nebraska and Iowa 
and as much as 10 feet over flood stage in parts of Missouri.

The
corps expects the river to remain high at least into August because of 
heavy spring rains in the upper Plains and substantial Rocky Mountain 
snowpack melting into the river basin.

Aid: The National Guard provides two large "bladders," water tanks that hold thousands of gallons of water, for Minot's Trinity Hospital

The
berm collapse comes as the National Guard battled to remove a tiny 
footbridge that holds the key to saving a small North Dakota town from 
being engulfed in flood waters.

Up
to 4,000 homes and business in Minot will be wiped off the map if the 
bridge, which has become wedged against a levee, is not removed.

The
small bridge is collecting debris, causing the water to swell violently
around the levee - further eroding the last line of defence against the
river Mouse.

Hope: Minot residents have started looking to recovery today although many of those affected by the floods do not have flood insurance

Speaking to CBS, Minot's Mayor Curt Zimbelman said the man-made levees threatened to fail in the wake of the huge volumes of water.

He said: 'If [the levee] goes, everything goes in this whole, this whole area, for several blocks up, several businesses.

'We either hold this whole dike, this whole temporary dike or we lose it all.'

Although the river crested, it is still flowing at 50 times its normal rate and is expanded to 10 times its normal size.Â 

Thin line: Levee's protecting homes in North Dakota were reinforced on the weekend

The city has prepared for the worst 
with workers bolstering levees that stand between thousands of dry homes
and the rising waters.

Workers sweated over sandbags on the weekend as levees were built up to six feet above the level of the rising waters.

There
is already widespread damage in the town, with Mayor Zimbelman 
reporting more than 4,000 homes had been flooded in an evacuation zone 
of neighbourhoods nearest the river.

About 11,000 people were ordered out last week.

Lead excavator Russ Gohl has drafted in every flood fighter in the area and has even drafted in the National Guard to help.

He said: 'By removing the bridge its 
collecting debris and its causing the water to swirl and erode our dikes
and what we are going to do is hook on and try and physically brute 
force pull the bridge away.'

Fed
by heavy rains upstream and dam releases that have accelerated in 
recent days, the Souris surged past a 130-year-old record today and kept
going.

This week emergency officials focused on protecting water and sewer systems to avoid the need for more evacuations.

Problems at Minot's water treatment 
plant prompted the state Department of Health to issue a 'boil order' on
Saturday for users of city water.

It also applies to the Minot Air 
Force Base, about 13 miles north of town, which gets its drinking water 
from Minot's municipal system.

Zimbelman said city officials were 'not completely sure at this point' that Minot's water supply had been contaminated.

'It has not been fully tested ... to 
show that it is contaminated,' Zimbelman said. 'There is just a concern 
at this point, so we're taking precautions.'

Minot's Broadway Street bridge over 
the Souris, which is its most important connection between the north and
south sections of the city, is likely to remain closed until the crest 
recedes, the mayor said.

Despite the gloomy 
outlook, stories of people helping each other were a heartwarming 
counterpoint to the destruction from unprecedented flooding along the 
Souris valley in north-central North Dakota.

Brought together by word of mouth, church and civic networks, social 
media and random encounters, those with housing and supplies to spare 
gave willingly to those without.

So
many opened their doors that while some 11,000 people were evacuated 
from neighbourhoods nearest the river, only a few hundred used shelters 
at Minot State University and the City Auditorium.

'For
the rest of the country, that is kind of mind-boggling. But ... that's 
how we are in North Dakota,' Senator John Hoeven said.

A Facebook page called Minot ND Flood Help drew volunteer offers to haul furniture, care for pets, clean laundry and even give therapeutic massages - many from outside town.

Patrica Eide of Tioga, about 85 miles west, posted an offer to loan her 30-foot camper to a displaced family.

It quickly drew a taker: a man with a wife and three children who were living in their van since being evacuated.

'We could probably rent that thing for $500 a month, but I told my husband there's no way I'm going to be greedy,' Eide, 62, said by phone.

'God just had better plans for our camper than renting it.'

She was preparing to haul it to Minot with a load of canned tomatoes and green beans, a grill, propane and other supplies.

'I think we've got 'em covered,' she said.

A common sight was garages packed with televisions, books, clothing and other items as residents turned their homes into temporary storage units for flood victims.
