Emails have become the norm within the workplace but they are now being banned at some Australian companies  as it is seen to be the cause of stress and misunderstandings among staff.

Face-to-face interaction or instant messaging has become the preferred means of communication among these employees in order to de-clutter their inbox and create better working relationships.

One director also says his team has been advised against sending emails to each other during out of office hours, including weekends.

Some Australian companies are banning emails as directors believe internal emails cause stress and misunderstandings among staff

Nathan Schokker, the director of facilities management service provider Talio, says he implemented this new rule six months ago and has already seen a positive difference in the workplace.

The policy was introduced to his 30 staff members in Brisbane after particular instances which caused unnecessary pressure, conflict and disagreements. 

'We had a few cases where staff were feeling compelled to respond to emails that were sent on weekends or public holidays,' Mr Schokker told Daily Mail Australia.

'Staff were feeling like their personal time was being stolen from them.

'I also found that it is hard to imply the correct tone in an email so there were often instances where staff were offended by emails sent by other colleagues or felt like they were being unfairly treated.

'It was enough to cause angst among employees which further became a distraction in the workplace.'

For the CEO of website optimisation company Quasion,  he's introduced instant messaging among staff and has left email correspondence for clients only.

'It's about finding the right way to communicate in a simple manner within the workplace,' Matt Braithwaite-Young told Daily Mail Australia.

'I'm not anti-email. I believe clients love emails but they have to be relevant. 

'However emailing often isn't suitable for internal communication and these kind of emails can clutter our inbox.

'I found that instant messaging was much suitable for the business and also a very casual form of communication.'

Mr Braithwaite-Young also introduced this new strategy about eight months ago to his five Sydney staff and 15 others who are based overseas.

'The problem with email is that it is an e-version of a letter so it's unnecessary for internal communication,' he said.

'Also if your inbox is getting too cluttered that's also bad for the business because it'll pile up over important emails from clients and they can often get lost this way.'

Mr Braithwaite-Young says emails or even phone calls can be intrusive to staff who are not in the office at the time.

'With instant messaging, people can respond when it's suitable for them when they're back in the office,' he said.

'There's a misconception and expectation that your response to instant messages has to be immediate but that's not how we see it. For us, it's an organising method that works for our great team and working culture.'

One company director said he banned internal emails as his staff were increasingly feeling pressued to respond to them, particulary during their time off work

So far, Mr Schokker says the new policy has been successful and is hoping to continue enforcing it at his company.

And if an urgent matter arises after office hours, Talio staff are encouraged to phone colleagues 'out of respect for each other'.

'I believe that work shouldn't interfere with your personal time and that way staff will come back to work much happier the next day,' Mr Schokker said.

'We've also empowered employees to be self-governing when they receive internal emails, so they can choose to have a quiet word amongst themselves or not respond at all or respond when they're back in the office.

'Now we've seen about a 90 per cent reduction in emails and I can without a doubt say that it has improved our workplace.'
