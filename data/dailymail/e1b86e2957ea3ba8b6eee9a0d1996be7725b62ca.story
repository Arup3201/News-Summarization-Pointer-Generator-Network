QPR boss Harry Redknapp revealed in May that Remy, 27, has an £8million release fee in his contract - and Arsenal are now ready to trigger the clause.

While a deal to take Remy to the Emirates Stadium is still to be concluded, it is understood the French striker is prepared to push for a move to north London.

The former Marseille forward has made a switch to Arsenal his top priority, something that should clear the path towards his Arsenal arrival.

Remy impressed during a loan spell at Newcastle last season, where he scored 14 goals in 24 starts for the Magpies.

Alan Pardew is keen on keeping Remy, but the forward's determination to resume his Champions League career at Arsenal has proved a major stumbling block.

Wenger wants to sign two new strikers this summer and retains an interest in AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli, Real Madrid hotshot Alvaro Morata and Bayern Munich star Mario Mandzukic.

The potential capture of Remy still leaves Wenger with the vast majority of his £100million transfer kitty to sign a second new forward.

Wenger also wants to sign a new right-back, defensive centre-midfielder and a back-up goalkeeper.
