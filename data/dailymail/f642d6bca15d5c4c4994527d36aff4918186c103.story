Walter Dauny, who was presumed dead, is to have his name removed from a memorial after it emerged he lived until 1988

A prisoner-of-war thought to have died at the hands of the Germans during World War Two will have his name erased from a memorial after it emerged he actually lived until 1989, and died of natural causes. 

Walter Dauny, born in St Peter parish, Jersey in April 1926, was presumed dead when he failed to return to the Channel island after he was sentenced to eight months in a Prisoner of War camp in Normandy, France, for stealing a German soldier's boots.

The former shop assistant, who was also 
known as John, is still one of 22 names on the Lighthouse Memorial in St
 Helier which was erected in 1996 to remember Islanders who lost their 
lives in prisons or camps during the conflict.

The mistake was only spotted this year, by Walter's nephew, Paul Dauny, during a visit to the island.

Mr Dauny,
 39, of Stamford, Lincolnshire, revealed that his uncle had found his way to 
London after being rescued and repatriated to Paris when his camp was 
taken over by allied troops.

Jersey was invaded by the Germans in June 1940, along with the rest of the Channel Islands.

They were the only part of British territory to be under Nazi occupation during the war.

Mr Dauny said: 'He needs to be remembered as he was deeply affected by what happened, but out of respect to those who died in the camps, it would not be right to keep his name on the memorial.

'Dauny is an unusual surname on the island and I thought it was strange there was one on the memorial when I saw it and wanted to know more about it. 

'I never met Walter so can't say a great deal about him. I think he kept himself to himself. 

'It is a unique and amazing story and I hope he is remembered in the right way. There is a difference between being a thief in peace time and doing whatever you can to annoy the Germans during war time.'

Walter, whose mother died when he was one, is described by his half-brother Trevor, 67, of Lewisham, London, as 'a one-man resistance against the Germans'.

Walter was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in 1944 in Normandy, France, aged 18 when the Germans took over occupation of his homeland, Jersey.

The youngster took exception to the invasion and turned to crime to irritate the Nazis. He even served a five month jail term in 1943 for stealing a bottle of Cognac.

His luck ended in January 1944 when his landlord found a pair of military boots and handed him into the Germans.

He was tried by the German occupiers in February of that year and sentenced to nine months imprisonment at tough jail Villeneuve St George's on the outskirts of Paris.

The court verdict said: 'It must be clear to the local population that German property must not be touched. Those who offend against this principle must be severely punished.'Trevor, who confirmed that Walter died of natural causes in May 1989, aged 63, said: 'He gave them hell during the war. He hated the Germans and was uncontrollable in his youth. 

'He would make as much misery for them as possible as he had Germans living in his house. He stole shoes from them, let cows out of fields and didn't have any care for the curfews. 

'They sent him away in the end. I feel sorry for him really. He was very unfortunate and got the wrong end of the stick all of his life.

'As for our relationship the first time I ever saw him was in Peckham after he was liberated by the Red Cross. I barely ever saw him again.

'Police came and informed me that he had died. I went to his funeral. There was no one else to bury him so we did it.

'It would not be fair if he was on the memorial and I wouldn't be happy for it as he didn't die under the Nazis. But we all remember him fondly even though we weren't close.'

After being liberated by the Red Cross in October 1944, Walter was sent first Paris and then onto London as Jersey was still under control of Nazi troops. He never returned to the island. 

Walter Dauny's life after the war remains a mystery beyond his death. The family never knew if he married, had a family of his own or what he did for a living.

A Jersey Heritage statement said: 'New documents only made available this year and testimony of a surviving relative has proved that Walter Dauny did not die in captivity as presumed.

'The memorial was dedicated in 1996 following information brought to light by historian Joe Mihre.

'No one questioned the information about Dauny or his inclusion on the memorial, and both were based on material available at the time.

'Until the recent visit the Dauny family were not aware of the memorial or the mistake on it. We are convinced Walter and John Dauny are one and the same man. 

'We have verified that beyond any doubt Walter Dauny did survive. His name will be temporarily obscured so it will not be visible for the 2014 Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony in January. 

'Once further historical research has established there are no more names to be added or removed from the memorial, the panel engraved with Dauny's name will be renovated to remove his name permanently.'
