The first evidence emerged yesterday that the blistering pace of house price rises in many parts of Britain, particularly London, is grinding to a halt.

A report, from the Halifax, said house prices have fallen in three of the last four months, dropping in March, April and June.

If there had not been a sharp jump in May of four per cent, the average house price, currently £183,462, would currently be lower than it was last winter.

A separate report, published today by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said its research clearly points to ‘some moderation in the positive trend.’

There is ‘more buyer caution’, it said, particularly an ‘increased air of caution’ in London with fewer people showing an interest in buying a home.

Estate agents said the cooling off is driven by recent interventions by the Bank of England and the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.

On 26 April, new rules, introduced by the FCA, made the process of getting a mortgage much more torturous, with rigorous checks about everything that homebuyers spend their money on.

To add to the pressure on the housing market, the Bank’s new rules limit how many people will be allowed to borrow 4.5 times or more of their salary when taking out a loan.

There is also the imminent prospect of the first interest rate rise for seven years, although the Bank insists that the increases will be ‘limited and gradual’.

The latest figures from the Bank clearly point to a slowdown in the number of people who are managing to get a mortgage to buy a house.

In January, around 76,000 people got a house purchase loan. By May, it had fallen to just under 62,000 a month.

An agent, from Doncaster, said: ‘There has been a very noticeable decrease in meaningful activity.

‘The so-called property bubble never reached this area and this year we have not sold one property over the initial asking price.’

One estate agent, from Kings Lynn, Norfolk, said: ‘The talk of interest rate increases and the stricter conditions on mortgages is limiting demand.’

Another agent, from Exeter, said: ‘The new mortgage rules are creating significant hold-ups in processing some mortgage applications.’

One agent, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, said: ‘The mortgage affordability rule changes and the possibility of interest rate rises has definitely dampened demand.’

Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, said: ‘Rhetoric from key officials at the Bank, including the governor Mark Carney, alongside the consequences of the introduction of the mortgage changes, are already slowing momentum, particularly in London.’

Britain’s housing market has never been more divided with a gulf of over £200,000 between a home in the capital and one outside London, according to the Nationwide.

For the first time, the average price of a home in London has gone above £400,000 although this huge sum will buy only a tiny studio flat or a garage in many areas.

Last week’s report, from the Nationwide, the country’s biggest building society, said the gap is ‘the widest that it has ever been’.
