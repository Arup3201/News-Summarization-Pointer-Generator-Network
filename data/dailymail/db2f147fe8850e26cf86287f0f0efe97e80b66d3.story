Mrs Colella was in hospital until she was granted home detention bail on November 7, but failed to appear in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on November 27. She turned up on Thursday and requested an Italian interpreter

She was in hospital until she was granted home detention bail on November 7, but failed to appear in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on November 27.

Magistrate Bob Harrup issued a warrant for her arrest, but ordered it to remain on the file and be activated only if she did not attend court on January 15.

Colella turned up on Thursday when she was due to answer the charge, but the case was adjourned to February 2 when an Italian interpreter will be required.

When she was granted bail last year, her lawyer said she had never been in trouble with the police and had suffered from undiagnosed psychosis and psychotic episodes before her husband's death.

The crown had argued against bail saying Colella was unstable and posed a risk to herself and the community.

The victim was a retired bus driver, described as 'a lovely old fella' by neighbours. 

Mr Colella, was aged in his 70s, had three children and and was a grandfather who lived in the Alberton home with his wife for about 20 years.

He was found dead in a bedroom and his wife was then arrested inside the house.
