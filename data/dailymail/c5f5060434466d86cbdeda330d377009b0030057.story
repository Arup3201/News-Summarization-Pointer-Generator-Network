Floating around the globe, drifting from country to country, never staying in one place long enough to get bored … 

If you like travelling, life on the Freedom Ship, the world’s first floating city, sounds perfect.

There’s only a couple of hitches – it’s not built yet, and it’s going to look an awful lot like a multi-storey carpark when it is.

Designed by the Florida-based Freedom Ship International, the floating city, concept pictured, is set to cost $10 billion and weigh 2.7 million tonnes - making it too large to ever dock. The ship would spend the whole time at sea, circling the globe once every two years, powered by solar and wave energy

Width: 750ft

Length: 4,500ft

Height: 350ft

Weight: 2.7 million tones

Capacity: 50,000 permanent residents with room for an extra 30,000 daily visitors, 20,000 crew and 10,000 overnight guests.

Cost: $10 billion

Buildings: Accommodation, schools, hospitals, businesses, parks, promenades, an art gallery, a shopping centre, casino and airport

Its designers have released computer-generated photographs of what they hope the mile-long vessel will look like.

It
 would have enough room for 50,000 permanent residents within its 25 
storeys and boasts schools, hospitals, art galleries, shops, parks, an 
aquarium and a casino. It would even have its own airport on the roof, 
with a runway serving small private and commercial aircraft carrying up 
to  40 passengers each.

Roger
 M Gooch, director and vice-president of Florida-based firm Freedom Ship
 International, said: ‘The Freedom Ship will be the largest vessel ever 
built, and the first ever floating city.’

His
 company is trying to raise the estimated £6billion needed to turn the 
dream, which has been several years in the planning, into an ocean-going
 reality.  

‘This will be a 
very heavily capitalised project and the global economy in the last few 
years hasn’t been too inviting for unproven progressive projects like 
ours,’ he added.

‘[But] in 
the last six months we’ve been getting more interest in the project and 
we are hopeful we will raise the $1billion (£600million) to begin 
construction.’ The ship would spend 70 per cent of its time anchored off
 major cities and the rest sailing between countries.

Powered
 by solar panels and wave energy, the city would navigate from the east 
coast of the US across the Atlantic to Europe and into the 
Mediterranean.

It would loop
 back and sail around the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of Africa and 
across to Australia. Heading into East Asia, it would steer across the 
Pacific before spending the end of the year on the west coast of North 
America. It would chase the summer sun into South America.  

If
 completed, the city will be 750ft at the beam, 350ft high and 4,500ft 
in length – four times longer than the Queen Mary II cruise 
ship which measures 1,132ft.

Visitors and residents would be able to leave the ship, either by plane or by boat thanks to a dock at the rear, concept pictured, to visit cities and countries where the ship will also pick up supplies as and when needed

The Freedom Ship, concept pictured, is a mile long, 25 storeys high and features schools, hospitals, businesses, parks, promenades, an art gallery, a shopping centre, casino and airport on the roof

The planned route, pictured, would take the ship from the east coast of the U.S across the Atlantic into Europe, passing Italy before looping back and sailing around Africa and across to Australia. It would then travel into Asia before spending the end of the year on the west coast of the U.S and South America

In addition to 50,000 permanent residents, the Freedom Ship would also have room for an extra 30,000 daily visitors, 20,000 crew and 10,000 overnight guests

The airport, on the ship's top deck, pictured, would serve private and small commercial aircraft carrying up to 40 passengers each. It could also be used to fly supplies to the ship. Aircraft could land and takeoff even when the ship is moving

This drawing shows a cross section of the ship. If built, the whole vessel would be 750ft wide, 350ft tall and 4,500 ft long. This would make it four times longer than the Queen Mary II cruise ship

The vessel, concept pictured, is just an idea at the moment until the Florida-based designers can raise at least $1 billion to start construction. The company said following a hiatus, and a drop in the global economy, it has started receiving interest in the ship again and hopes to raise this funding soon

The Freedom Ship is 25 storeys high and would feature a casino, an art gallery, a park and a shopping centre

The concept, designed by a Florida-based company would cost $10billion if was commissioned to be built

The vessel could house 50,000 people but it would contain additional space to hold an extra 30,000 visitors

The ship would constantly sail around the world - doing a full circuit every two years - but would be too large to enter any ports
