A person with a 'history of travel to West Africa' has tested negative for Ebola after being placed in isolation at a Welsh hospital. 

The person, who has recently returned from an area of West Africa affected by the virus, was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Cardiff after developing a fever.

Robert Webb, from Public Health Wales, said all precautions had been taken at the hospitals and nurses and doctors had been monitoring the person in full protective clothing.

A spokeswoman for Public Health Wales said: 'Public Health Wales can confirm that an individual tested for Ebola earlier today at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital does not have the disease.

'There may be other explanations for their symptoms for which tests are already under way. 

'There is no reason to believe that there is any wider public health risk.

'We would once again like to reassure the public that all appropriate precautions have been taken to protect the patient, NHS staff and the wider community.

'We are unable to provide further comment on individual patients and therefore will not be issuing any further press statements on this case.

'It is important to remember that to date, only one case of Ebola has been identified in the UK and there has been none in Wales. 

'The infection can be transmitted only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The risk to the public from Ebola remains low.'

Owen Smith, MP for Pontypridd and shadow Welsh secretary, said earlier today: 'I am being kept informed by the leadership of Royal Glamorgan Hospital of the facts of the situation, as they unfold. 

'I know that the people of Pontypridd will be compassionate and understand the risk to public health is extremely limited.

'I would also like to extend my thanks to the hardworking staff of Royal Glamorgan Hospital, who will no doubt be giving their patient the very best care, as they endeavour to do for all patients.' 

The suspected case came as the condition of British nurse Pauline Cafferkey remains critical at London's Royal Free Hospital.

The 39-year-old was diagnosed with Ebola after returning from Sierra Leone in West Africa where she was volunteering with Save the Children last month.

She has been given an anti-viral drug and is being transfused with blood plasma from a European Ebola survivor but both treatments are 'not proven to work', her doctor Michael Jacobs said. 

The decision by Heathrow officials to wave Miss Cafferkey through even though she said she felt ill sparked the search for 203 people who may have had contact with her on two flights

Officials from both Public Health England and Health Protection Scotland are currently reviewing the UK's screening procedures for Ebola, after it emerged Ms Cafferkey had been cleared to fly from London to Glasgow despite her temperature being checked seven times after she landed at Heathrow. 

The nurse was admitted to an isolation facility at the Brownlee unit in Gartnavel Hospital, Glasgow, at 8am on December 29.

After a blood sample tested positive for Ebola, she was transferred by military plane to the Royal Free Hospital early the following morning.  

With more health workers due to return to the UK from Sierra Leone in the next two weeks, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pledged: 'We will keep all of the procedures under review. 

'It is important that we learn lessons from the case of Pauline Cafferkey and that we learn lessons from any other case that might arise.

'I hope there are no other cases identified in Scotland or the UK but it is likely we will see other cases, a small number of additional cases, and we need to keep learning from the experience of dealing with them.'

Ms Cafferkey had been working with the charity Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, before she became ill. 

At the Royal Free, where fellow nurse Will Pooley recovered from Ebola this year, she is in a cocooned bed in an isolation ward where medics treat her wearing protective suits. 

Earlier this week, a Briton who was feared to have the deadly virus tested negative for Ebola at Swindon hospital.

The negative case follows two suspected patients last week - in Cornwall and Aberdeen - who were also confirmed not to have the virus. 

Yesterday it emerged the first safety trial of an experimental preventative Ebola vaccine is under way at a British university.

The Oxford Vaccine Group, part of the University of Oxford Department of Paediatrics, aims to have vaccinated 72 healthy adults by the end of this month.

Developers of the drug, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, have now accelerated it due to the continued spread of Ebola in West Africa. 

Ebola has so far killed 8,153 people and infected 20,656 in the past year, mainly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures.
