Killer: Jeremy Bamber, pictured in 2002, is appealing against his 'inhuman' whole life sentence despite committing multiple murders

Mass killer Jeremy Bamber is to appeal against the decision to put him behind bars for the rest of his life because it is 'inhuman and degrading,' it was revealed today.

In November the 51-year-old, who murdered his parents, his sister and her two children in 1985, will have his case heard in Strasbourg's Grand Chamber, the appeal court of the European Court of Human Rights.

Two other British killers will also appeal in cases that will test whether the UK’s law allowing the most dangerous offenders to be sentenced to whole life tariffs, with almost no chance of release, is cruel.

Bamber has appealed again after Europe’s human rights judges ruled in January that Britain’s most notorious criminals could be kept behind bars for the rest of their lives.

The European Court of Human Rights held by four votes to three that there had been no violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is enshrined in UK law under the Human Rights Act and prohibits 'inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'.

Condemning people to die in jail was not 'grossly disproportionate' and in each case London’s High Court had 'decided that an all-life tariff was required, relatively recently and following a fair and detailed consideration', the judges ruled.

This will now be tested by the court’s Grand Chamber after a panel of five judges also granted the appeal by killer Douglas Vinter, who stabbed his wife in February 2008.

Peter Moore's sentence, handed down after he killed four gay men for his sexual gratification in 1995, will also be considered by the Grand Chamber judges.

Bamber’s solicitor, Simon McKay, said today: 'He’s obviously delighted with the decision.

'It demonstrates that his case remains arguable and he looks forward to presenting his position at the Grand Chamber in due course.'

Mr McKay went on: 'It is part of his long battle to challenge the home secretary of the day going beyond what the trial judge said would be the appropriate sentence he should receive.

'He’s encouraged by it, but he’s realistic and acknowledges that it’s just another stepping point.

'The final analysis will depend on what the Grand Chamber says in the end.'

Bamber’s legal team originally submitted the application to the ECHR in December 2009.

But their claims were strongly opposed by Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke, who has said the Government has been 'fighting the case vigorously and defending the principle of the whole-life tariff.'

Under current law, whole-life tariff prisoners will almost certainly never be released from prison as their offences are deemed to be so serious.

They can be freed only by the Justice Secretary, who can give discretion on compassionate grounds when the prisoner is terminally ill or seriously incapacitated.

Bamber has been behind bars for more than 25 years for shooting his wealthy adopted parents June and Neville, his sister Sheila Caffell and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas at their farmhouse in Tolleshunt D’Arcy, Essex.

The 51-year-old was given a whole-life tariff after being convicted of the murders in October 1986.

But he has always protested his innocence and claims his schizophrenic sister Ms Caffell shot her family before turning the gun on herself in a remote Essex farmhouse.

In 2009, Bamber lost a Court of Appeal challenge against the order that he must die behind bars. He has twice lost appeals against conviction.

Vinter was released from prison after serving nine years for the 1995 murder of work colleague Carl Edon, 22. Three years later he stabbed wife Anne White four times and strangled her, before being given a whole-life order.

Moore was convicted of four counts of murder in 1996 after killing four gay men for his sexual gratification.

It is the latest case where Europe’s human rights court could try to overrule British judges.

In May, judges at the European Court of Human Rights once again ruled against Britain’s blanket ban on prisoners voting and gave the Government six months to change the law.

Prime Minister David Cameron has said the idea of relaxing the ban 'makes me physically ill' and officials are working out how to respond to the court’s demand.
