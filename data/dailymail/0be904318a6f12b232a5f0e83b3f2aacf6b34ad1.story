The American veterinarian trapped in East Timor accused of drug trafficking has spent her 41st birthday in custody as the case looks set to drag on for years.

Dr Stacey Addison claims she was sharing a taxi with a man who stopped to pick up a package - and police immediately swooped, arresting them all.

It transpired the package contained methamphetamine, which  Dr Addison was unaware of, her mother claims.

She was detained then released after five days - but then detained once more when she appeared in court.

Despite a move to a women's unit in a cell with two English speakers, her mother has issued a desperate plea for support after her daughter turned 41 in detention on November 5.

Distraught: She said it breaks her heart to know Stacey is locked up despite 'knowing nothing' of the case

In an open letter to her daughter on a Facebook group titled Help Stacey, Bernadette Kero, wrote: 'Stacey, if only I could talk to you. You are on my mind every second of the day. It breaks my heart to think of you spending your birthday in prison. My only wish is for you to be free. You don't deserve any of this.' 

She has received two short notes from her daughter via the US Embassy, Kero explained, which reveal she has been able to communicate with the Cuba-trained doctors in Spanish and the prison staff are friendly.

'I spent my birthday at the clinic being treated for an abscess, most of the doctors study in Cuba so luckily for me, speak Spanish,' one of the notes read.

The new cell permits one-hour visits twice a week, plus visits from her lawyer and U.S. Embassy envoys.

She has been granted a mattress and can go outside for two hours a day - an improvement on her previous detainment. 

There are 17 women in the unit and one baby, 18 months old.

UC Berkeley grad Dr Stacey Addison was seized while traveling from Indonesian territory to independent East Timor on September 5.

The vet spent five terrifying days in jail and was forced to surrender her passport.

She was optimistic about her release when she appeared in court on September 24 - but instead they detained her once more. 

In flux: 40-year-old Portland, Oregon veterinarian Dr. Stacey Addison was detained in East Timor and set free, but authorities took her passport and expect her to stay in the country during a probe that could take a year

Drug charge: Addison says a man she shared a taxi with on September 5 was caught with a package of methamphetamine and she was arrested along with him

The 40-year-old from Portland, Oregon has now been trying to get home for weeks. She's been in contact with American news outlets via Skype despite her shaky internet connection.

'I'm a suspect in a crime I didn't commit,' she told KGO shortly before the court case: 'I don't know what's going to happen with the case, so it just makes everything really scary.'

Authorities in East Timor strip-searched Addison and took a urine sample upon her arrest.

She says she knew she had no drugs and that her drug test would be negative, so at first she wasn't too worried.

'I thought, OK, I haven't done anything. It should be OK. But it's not,' she told KOIN.

After days of sleeping on a floor with 13 other women in jail and her subsequent release without a passport, the worry set in.

Initial pleas to the U.S. Embassy were fruitless because diplomats aren't allowed to interfere with a foreign crime investigation. 

Holding out hope: Addison, who's often traveled abroad to do volunteer work as a vet, has been in touch with American media via a shaky internet connection. She says she's been in contact with her U.S. Senator and some diplomatic officials

'I haven't committed a crime, I've done nothing wrong and the facts will prove that,' she said, but, 'their system is different here in that they have a long period to investigate and I'm sort of stuck in this.'

While things appeared hopeless, by Tuesday leaders from both the state of Oregon and from East Timor had become 'aware of the situation' according to what Addison told KOIN.

In addition to the foreign minister and prime minister, Addison said she's in touch with the office of U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley's office via email and hopes the case will be resolved sooner rather than later.

She said she's been told such investigations are known to take up to a year.

'I'm not asking that they have special treatment,' she said. 'I'm just asking that they look at the evidence. There isn't any evidence.'
