A model who was brutally attacked in a Glasgow nightclub has taken part in her first full photo shoot for 11 months.

Lauren McDonald, 27, feared her modelling career was over when she was savagely beaten with a stiletto and struck in the face with a glass in an unprovoked assault. 

She was attacked by two girls in September last year at the Sanctuary club in Glasgow's west end, where Radio 1 DJ Trevor Nelson was playing a set.

Ms McDonald said the attack had left her 'frightened' and 'emotional, angry and disgusted' but has now got her confidence back. She has recently returned from a week-long trip to Chicago where she secured a deal with fashion magazine, Regime 

Ms McDonald took part in the photo shoot after undergoing three laser surgeries on her face following the savage attack in September 2013

The model, who was out with six friends, suffered a fractured skull and was drenched in blood. She was also left with a six-inch scar on her face which she thought could end her career. 

But now, after undergoing laser surgery, she has taken part in her first full photo shoot for 11 months. 

Ms McDonald, from Anniesland in Glasgow, told the MailOnline: 'I went through a huge whirlwind. I was emotional, angry and disgusted by what had happened. 

'I have had three laser surgeries on my face now. They're incredibly painful but they reduce the scarring and and redness on my face. 

'Also in the first operation, they stitched up glass in my face and so I had to go back and have another operation three weeks later.'  

The Glasgow model has got her career back on track after a horrific attack in a nightclub 

The glamour model said she can remember the night of the assault clearly.

'I came back from the VIP area and remember my hair being pulled and then felt contact to my face and then I put my hand on my face and was covered in blood and fell to the floor.

'I remember people were looking at me with their mouths open.' 

And she said the appalling ordeal had changed her as a person.

'I used to be the party girl and go out all the time. After what happened, I thought "what's the point of making an effort?" 

'I was also frightened of going out and leaving the house. 

'I am starting to get some of my confidence back, but I  don't feel myself anymore. I don't go out in the way I used to.

'The attack has made me more determined to try my best and do what I love, my work.'

Ms McDonald, who dated American midfielder Maurice Edu after he arrived at Ibrox from Major League Soccer side Toronto FC in a £2.6m deal in 2008, said: 'In the last two months I've been getting back into new jobs.'

Ms McDonald has recently returned from a week-long trip to Chicago where she secured a deal with fashion magazine, Regime, which will be distributed in airports across the world.

She also appeared in television soap River City twice last month and is looking forward to featuring in a reality TV show and documentary, while continuing her treatment at the La Belle Forme clinic in Glasgow.
