Amanda Bynes was seen chain smoking, pulling up her shirt and even taking off her bra on the busy streets of New York City moments before  allegedly shoplifting earlier today.

TMZ claims the troubled 28-year-old actress was 'caught by security' at Barneys New York on Madison Avenue after she left the store with a $200 hat she did not pay for.

Even though staff at the luxury department store were said to have called police, the What A Girl Wants star was not taken into custody and was let go after being questioned.

Odd behavior: Amanda Bynes (above) was at it again today in NYC, this time standing alone on a busy block chain smoking broken cigarettes and flashing passersby

It gets worse: Then she just took her bra off

Scene of the (maybe) crime: Bynes was photographed browsing at the midtown store (above) before the reported incident occurred 

She did however agree to never return to the store again.

According to sources, the LA native was 'nabbed by security guards  after she tried to leave without paying.'

Law enforcement sources claim 'she put on a $200 hat and walked out of the store and security nabbed her outside.'

Witnesses have accused the star of 'acting crazy.' Four NYPD officers were claimed to have 'arrived on scene to question her.'

Strange days: Inside the store, Bynes looked at jewelry by herself, while adjusting the neck of her shirt repeatedly and protecting her eyes from the harsh glare of retail store lighting

All cut up: The actress also took off her sunglasses while inside for just a second, showing the Band-Aid that has been covering her face this past week to cover an unknown injury

Adding more drama to the already bizarre incident, Bynes said she wanted to buy the hat, and was going to get her wallet out of the car but got flustered because a fan was snapping pictures of her in the store.

She said she had no intention of stealing. 

No word if she bought the hat. 

Amanda has been in New York City for less than a week and she has already been accused of talking to herself in public, looking disheveled with a bandage on her face, scratching a woman at a nightclub and wearing one shoe while inside Bloomingdale's, which is also a high-end Manhattan department store.

Nothing to see her: Her bra seemed to be causing her some real problems

More cuts: The actress' ankle was covered in tiny bandages 

She has also claimed to be engaged to 19-year-old actor Caleb who she met in rehab and has been seen wearing a diamond engagement ring.

Bynes flew to the Big Apple on Friday after she was arrested on suspicion of DUI in Los Angeles on September 28.

Oblivious: Byens went about smoking and adjusting herself as if no one were around

Shop girls: Some staff at the store seems to be trying to help the young woman

The troubled Easy A actress was pulled over in the San Fernando Valley neighbourhood of Los Angeles at 4 am and taken into custody, the California Highway Patrol confirmed with MailOnline.

She was cited for being under the influence of a controlled substance while driving her Mercedes-Benz and released at 12 noon that same day on $15,000 bail.

The former child star is set to appear in court on October 23 in Van Nuys.

For the past year Lynn and Rick Bynes have been taking care of their troubled daughter by opening the doors of their Thousand Oaks, California home and overseeing her medication after the star experienced a string of run-ins with the law.

Good eye: Among the purses she looked at was the incredibly popular Stella McCartney Falabella tote

More jewels: Bynes kept her lighter close while browsing the selection of precious metals

The actress also went on a Twitter tirade about magazines lying about her.

Legal eagle: Bynes went on a Twitter tirade later in the evening about false info being put out about her

Repeat offenders: Bynes is mad about an Interview InTouch printed that she says never happened

Lucky firm: She has lawyers too
