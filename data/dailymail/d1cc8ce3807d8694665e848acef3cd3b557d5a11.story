The founder of outlawed file-sharing website Megaupload launched his new online hub with a lavish ceremony at his £15.8m mansion, including a re-enactment of the police raid on his home, yesterday.

Kim Dotcom spoke from a giant stage at Dotcom Mansion in Coatsville Auckland, as he unveiled new site Mega, which the millionaire said comply with the law, rendering it safe from being taken down.

Dotcom then compared last year's raid to the iceberg which caused the Titanic disaster, saying without it 'we wouldn't have a
great Titanic movie which makes me cry every time I see it.'

Mega man: Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom launches his new file-sharing site 'Mega' surrounded by dancers

'Mega is going to be huge, and 
nothing will stop Mega!,' Dotcom shouted seconds before a helicopter roared 
overhead and faux police agents rappelled down the side of his mansion 
and female military guards in mini-skirts surrounded him on stage.

The controversial millionaire then 
ordered to 'stop this madness' before breaking out into a dance 
alongside the 'guards'.

The interest for Mega.co.nz is already high, and Dotcom said half a million users registered in its first 14 hours.

Kim Dotcom said his new ‘cyberlocker’ 
was not revenge on U.S. authorities, who are trying to extradite him and
 three colleagues from New Zealand, and last year closed Megaupload and 
charged him with online piracy for which he faces jail if found guilty.

‘This
 is not some kind of finger to the U.S. government or to Hollywood,’ 
Dotcom said at his sprawling New Zealand estate. ‘Legally, there’s just 
nothing there that could be used to shut us down,’ he said.

Happy raiding: Kim Dotcom poked fun at the police raid on his home last year with a cheeky re-enactment saying that he was glad it happened because 'without it we wouldn't have Mega'

Jolly Roger: Mega was launched exactly one year after Megaupload was shut down and Dotcom was arrested in the world's biggest online piracy case

Commander-in-chief: Dotcom, who claims then new site is not a 'revenge' on U.S. authorities who shut down his last venture, joined the fancy dress dancers in a jubilant boogie to celebrate the launch of Mega

Dotcom said Mega was a different beast
 to Megaupload, as the new site enables users to control exactly which 
users can access uploaded files, in contrast to its predecessor, which 
allowed users to search files, some of which contained copyrighted 
content allegedly without permission.

It offers 50 gigabytes of free storage, much more than similar sites 
such as Dropbox and Google Drive, and features a drag-and-drop upload 
tool.

A sophisticated encryption system will
 allow users to encode their files before they upload them on to the 
site’s servers, which Dotcom said were located in New Zealand and 
overseas.

Each file will then be issued a 
unique, sophisticated decryption key which only the file holder will 
control, allowing them to share the file as they choose.

The decryption keys for uploaded 
files are held by the users, not the site itself, which means the company can't see
 what's in the files being shared. Dotcom argues that Mega therefore 
can't be held liable for content it cannot see.

Pleased: Kim Dotcom's new site has already had a huge response, with 500,000 users registering in the first 14 hours

Unbreakable: Dotcom insists the new site complies with the law and is therefore impossible to shut down

Turnout: Guests, staff and media attended the launch at Dotcom mansion yesterday to hear Kim Dotcom unveil the new site

‘What he's trying to do is give 
himself a second-string argument: `Even if I was wrong before, this 
one's all right because how can I control something if I don't know that
 it's there?’' said Sydney attorney Charles Alexander, who specializes 
in intellectual property law.

‘I can understand the argument; whether it would be successful or not is another matter.’

He added that the launch is unlikely to have any impact on the Megaupload case.

‘All
 it might do is annoy them enough to say, “We're going to redouble our 
efforts in prosecuting them”. But I don't think it makes any practical 
difference to the outcome.’

The
 Motion Picture Association of America, which filed complaints about 
alleged copyright infringement by Megaupload, was not impressed.

‘We
 are still reviewing how this new project will operate, but we do know 
that Kim Dotcom has built his career and his fortune on stealing 
creative works,’ the MPAA said in a statement.

‘We'll
 reserve final judgment until we have a chance to take a closer look, 
but given Kim Dotcom's history of damaging the consumer experience by 
pushing stolen, illegitimate content into the marketplace, count us as 
sceptical.’

Defiant: Kim Dotcom is launching a new file sharing website called Mega exactly a year after the FBI shut down his old site Megaupload and charged him with online piracy

New venture: Dotcom insists his new offering, Mega.co.nz, which will launch on Sunday, complied with the law and warned that attempts to take it down would be futile

The faux raid at the Mega launch re-enacted the police raid on Dotcom last year.

Last January, New Zealand’s elite 
special tactics forces landed by helicopter at dawn in the grounds of 
Dotcom’s mansion, worth roughly NZ$30 million ($25.05 million) and 
featuring a servants’ wing, hedge maze and life-size statues of giraffes
 and a rhinoceros, to arrest him and his colleagues at the request of 
the FBI.

Police armed with semi-automatic 
weapons found Dotcom cowering alone in a panic room in the attic, while 
outside, a convoy of police cars and vans pulled up in the driveway. 
Around 70 officers took part in the raid.

Tweets: Dotcom announces the launch of new site Mega on Twitter

They left with computers, files and 
some of Dotcom’s fleet of Rolls-Royces, Mercedes and a vintage pink 
Cadillac tricked with personalised licence plates screaming ‘HACKER’, 
‘EVIL’, and ‘MAFIA’.

'Sometimes good
things come out of terrible events,' Dotcom said at
 the press conference which accompanied the launch, comparing the raid 
to the iceberg which cused the deaths of 1,502 people in the sinking of 
Titanic.

'For example, if it
wasn't for a giant comet hitting earth, we would still be surrounded by angry
dinosaurs - hungry, too.

'If it wasn't for that iceberg, we wouldn't have a
great Titanic movie which makes me cry every time I see it. And if it wasn't
for the raid, we wouldn't have Mega.'

Megaupload, started by Dotcom in 2005,
 was one of the most popular sites on the internet until U.S. 
prosecutors shut it down and accused him and several company officials 
of facilitating millions of illegal downloads.
