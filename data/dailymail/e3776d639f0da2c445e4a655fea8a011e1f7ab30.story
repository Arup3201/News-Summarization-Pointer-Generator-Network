Do you feel like your partner holds you back in the bedroom? You're not alone.

New research reveals 67 per cent of Brits believe they are more ‘sexually adventurous’ than their other half, with a quarter of these stating that they are ‘frustrated’ by the sexual mismatch.

The survey, which questioned 2,013 couples in a co-habiting relationship of six months or longer, asked, ‘Do you believe that you are more sexually adventurous than your partner?’ with the term explained as ‘open-minded and willing to try new things’.

Feeling frustrated? A new survey has revealed that 67 per cent of Brits believe that they are more 'sexually adventurous' than their partner and they're left feeling frustrated as a result

More than two thirds (67 per cent) of respondents said they were more adventurous in the bedroom than their other half.

These respondents were asked to share their exploits, in terms of the things they had tried in the past.

The top five most popular antics of sexually ‘adventurous’ Britons were role play (72 per cent), sex outdoors (61 per cent), sex in public places (37 per cent), sex with a stranger (28 per cent), and threesomes (26 per cent).

Less than half of the respondents (47 per cent) stated that they had embarked upon these experiences with their current partner.

Instead, the most common accomplice was ‘an ex-partner’ (64 per cent), followed by ‘a friend with benefits’ (28 per cent).

Feeling adventurous: The most sexually 'adventurous' antic amongst Brits was voted as role play - but most did this with an ex-partner

When asked if they ever felt ‘frustrated’ with their current partner’s sexual preferences, a quarter (23 per cent) confirmed they did.

The top three issues amongst frustrated Britons in relationships were voted as ‘my partner is not adventurous enough’ (73 per cent), ‘my partner doesn’t want to have sex as often as I do’ (63 per cent) and ‘my partner wants to have sex too often’ (31 per cent).

One in ten respondents (11 per cent) confessed that they were no longer sexually attracted to their partner.

Not satisfied? When asked if they ever felt 'frustrated' with their current partner's sexual preferences, a quarter of Brits confirmed that they did

A spokesperson for UKMedix, which commissioned the research, said: 'Who knew that us Brits were so adventurous in the bedroom?

'It even appears that we can get a little demanding with our need for adventure!

'There are bound to be differences between partners in any relationship and sex is a really subjective thing.

'Everyone has different tastes and no two people are the same. If you are really struggling with a mismatched sex drive, then the first and most important thing to do is talk to your other half.'
