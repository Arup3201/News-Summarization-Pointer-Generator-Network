Councils should be allowed to close down betting shops which are 'blighting' traditional high streets, local authority officials have argued.

Regional government officials have warned that attempts to keep betting shops away from Britain's town centres have stalled due to complex and expensive planning rules.

The Local Government Association will today warn MPs that some areas of London currently have as many as eight bookmakers on a single street.

The rise in betting shops has made them a 'blight' on Britain's high streets, according to local government officials

The rise of betting shops in British towns has led to increased crime and higher policing costs, according to the Daily Telegraph.

But councils are finding it more and more difficult closing down shops which 'cause misery for local people'.

David Parsons, chairman of the LGA's environment and housing board, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The Government must give councils new powers to stop betting shops setting up if they are likely to cause a public nuisance.

Warning: David Parsons, from the Local Government Association, said the rise of betting shops has increased policing costs and health problems

'At the moment, numbers cannot be restricted and this results in crime, disorder and misery for local people.

'We are seeing a reckless gamble with our high streets which is contributing to higher policing and health costs, in addition to reducing the quality of life for local residents.'

The LGA is expected to make its comments to MPs on the culture, media and sport comittee, which is currently investigating whether current laws are effective enough in protecting children from the harmful effects of gambling.

Dirk Vennix, a spokesperson for the Association of British Bookmakers, said it was important to study the evidence linked to gambling, adding that betting shops have only become an issue for 'a handful of councils'.
