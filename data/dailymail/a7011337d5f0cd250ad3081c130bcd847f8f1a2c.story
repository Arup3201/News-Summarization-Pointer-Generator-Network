Lionel Messi put pen to paper on a new contract with Barcelona that made him the highest-paid player in world football on £16.3million a year.

The Barcelona forward was pictured with club president Josep Maria Bartomeu signing his new deal two days after the Spanish season ended.

Messi overtook Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (£15m) on the list of highest-paid football players.

He's staying: Lionel Messi has agreed to sign a new deal keeping him at Barcelona

Boost: Messi agreeing a new deal is the news the Barcelona fans had been waiting for

Messi couldn't help Barcelona beat Atletico Madrid on Saturday and, as a result, the side from the Spanish capital won La Liga.

Wayne Rooney, the highest-paid player in England, is on £15.6m a year (£300,000 a week).

Messi’s
 previous deals have been structured so that basic pay before bonuses is
 re-set each year of the deal according to bonuses earned the previous 
season.

In effect Messi will earn £16.3m next season but if he 
wins the Champions League the appropriate bonus will be added and the 
sum total will become his new basic pay level the following season.

Messi’s
 £250m buy-out clause will remain the same leaving the door open for 
Manchester City or Paris Saint-Germain to make a bid, though the rigours
 of Financial Fair Play surely rule out such a move for either club.

A
 statement issued by the Catalans last Friday read: 'FC Barcelona has 
reached an agreement to adjust the terms in the contract binding Leo 
Messi to the club as a professional first team player. The revised and 
updated contract will be signed over the next few days.'

Most 
crucially from the club’s point of view, Messi’s new deal means Barca 
will now be better placed to tap in to the huge stream of commercial 
revenue he generates as for the first time since signing his initial 
deal in 2005 the player will not keep 100 per cent of his image rights -
 they will now be shared with the club.
