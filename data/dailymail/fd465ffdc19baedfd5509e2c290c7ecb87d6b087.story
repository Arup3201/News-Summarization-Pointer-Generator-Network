Much like Network Rail’s trains, Manchester United’s title campaign ground to a temporary halt in the north London area.

A win here, and they could have dared to dream going into the second half of the season. And while a goalless draw at White Hart Lane was far from a catastrophe, the performance was certainly less than is required of champions.

Chelsea are due here on January 1. We shall see what Jose Mourinho makes of a Tottenham team that remains very much a work in progress under Mauricio Pochettino.

To be fair, neither team should be particularly happy with this. Manchester United had the best of the first half but were undone by a combination of their own inefficiency in front of goal and the brilliance of goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.

The second half belonged to Tottenham but they did not carve out enough chances of import and while David de Gea was again impressive, it did not require heroics to keep the home team at bay.

The draw was the proper result, but those who expected a high-scoring affair given the ambition of these clubs and the array of talent on display left disappointed.

Harry Kane worked hard but to scant effect, while United’s expensive acquisitions could find no way through.

Louis van Gaal picked the same United side that beat Newcastle on Boxing Day — the first consistent starting XI for United since November 2012, a run of 85 league games — and will no doubt believe he had no option given one day to prepare between fixtures.

Yet United looked leggy by the end, with Tottenham in the ascendancy. They could have lost it with eight minutes remaining when Kane put through Ryan Mason with only De Gea to beat. He snatched at his shot and blasted over. There was an inevitability about the slow fade to the end from there.

It has been hard to overshadow De Gea this season, but Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris pulled it off. If there was one exceptional display here, it was his first 45 minutes, which shaded United’s standout performers, Ashley Young and Juan Mata.

Faced with a stellar front line and a supporting cast that is finally beginning to click, only Lloris prevented United having the game won by half-time.

He flew through the air acrobatically and stuck in a tackle on Robin van Persie that would have pleased John Terry. Yet, from a long way out, this was a game that was going to be settled by one goal — or left wanting for goals at all.

As Tottenham are currently playing the inexperienced Kane as a lone front man, they will have less to regret.

After the money spent on United’s forwards this season, nobody should leave a tense affair like this talking about Tottenham’s goalkeeper. Van Gaal would surely have expected to find a match-winner in his ranks, even accounting for seasonal fatigue.

The promise is certainly there. Mata is growing into his role this season and twice he picked out Radamel Falcao in the first half, Lloris dealing with both shots comfortably.

More fortunate was a 23rd-minute escape after Mata’s free-kick from 25 yards out clipped the top of the Tottenham wall and deflected on to Lloris’s near post. It rebounded, leaving the goalkeeper stranded and provoking a mad scramble, ended only when Vlad Chiriches cleared under pressure from Van Persie.

These were testing times for Tottenham and a minute later, pandemonium again. This time it was Van Persie’s header that provoked the confusion, Falcao and Phil Jones competing to force the ball over the line, before Jan Vertonghen cleared it with an acrobatic overhead kick. The replays showed the ball was in before Vertonghen made contact, but also that Jones was offside, and the free-kick to Tottenham was the correct decision.

United’s De Gea has proven expert at saving with his feet this season, but Lloris showed he was a match for that skill, too. Michael Carrick played a lovely through-ball over the top to Van Persie, putting him clear with only Lloris to beat. For a moment a breakthrough seemed certain, but Van Persie required too many touches and Lloris as good as tackled him, centre-half style, in the six-yard box.

Rounding off an outstanding first half, Lloris tipped out a cross by Young that swung in viciously, becoming a tasty shot. There were odd threats after half-time — most particularly two wild shots over the bar from Van Persie and Mata — but it was Tottenham’s game from there.

Unlike United, however, they rarely got in behind the back line and most of their opportunities came from range. Andros Townsend, Federico Fazio and Christian Eriksen all had a go, but it would have been a poor show from De Gea if any of the attempts had gone in, and his form is too good right now to be beaten from distance.

Managers like solid performances like this, particularly over the gruelling festive period, but anyone who has seen Chelsea or striker-less Manchester City of late will know the difference. It is more than mere tiredness.
