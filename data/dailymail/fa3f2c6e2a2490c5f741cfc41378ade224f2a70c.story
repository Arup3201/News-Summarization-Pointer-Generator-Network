These stunning aerial photographs over London make up the first-ever comprehensive bird's-eye view of our capital city - dating back to 1909.

The photos, showing Buckingham Palace, Westminster, South Kensington and even Chelsea's football ground Stamford Bridge, were taken by pioneering scientist Sir Norman Lockyer.

He took to the skies in a helium balloon and soared 500ft over London to shoot the breathtaking never-before-seen views.

A collection of 70 glass slides and negatives of the ground-breaking journey are to go under the hammer - but are only expected to fetch Â£500.

Lockyer is credited with discovering helium - and used his knowledge of the gas to lift off into the skies over the capital in 1909.

He then used his expertise to explore his hobby of photography - snapping the incredible portraits on a Victorian box-style camera.

The first official aerial survey of London was not completed until 1917.

Sir Norman's revolutionary pictures, taken in bright daylight to ensure maximum exposure, show virtually car-free roads in the capital at the turn of the 20th century.

Many of London's famous landmarks and old Victorian buildings remain the same - but the streets are clean and empty.

The capital's now giant skyline is 
pictured in its infancy, with low-rise properties punctuated by some of 
the world's most famous sights.

A gleaming Westminster is shown - 
minus the towering London Eye - and Chelsea's football ground Stamford 
Bridge can be seen with just one stand by the side of the pitch.

Its terracing and athletics track make it far removed from the 41,800 all-seater stadium it is today, more than 100 years later.

The West London football club, now 
owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, had only been founded in 
1905 - four years earlier.

Stamford Bridge was opened in 1877 as a home for London Athletics Club until The Blues took over in 1904.

The stadium's highest ever attendance was 82,905 for a league match with Arsenal in October 1935.

Trafalgar Square, now filled with the daily hustle and bustle of tourists, is shown desolate in the morning sunlight.

Parliament Square, St Paul's Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and Big Ben also feature in the clear slides.

All the black and white shots - including others from Egypt and Suez - will be up for grabs at the Dominic Winter auction house, in Cirencester, Gloucester, on November 16.

Pictures of Sir Norman are also available in the collection which will go under the hammer at the aviation and motoring auction.

The pioneering scientist, born Joseph Norman Lockyer, who also founded influential science journal Nature, died 11 years after his balloon flight over London.
