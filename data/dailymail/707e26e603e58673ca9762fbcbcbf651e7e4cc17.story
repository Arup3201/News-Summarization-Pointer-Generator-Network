The invite is classic Apple - white, minimalist, and devoid of much writing.

But it heralds what is perhaps the most anticipated device in the world (at least since Apple's last launc) - the fifth version of the iPhone.

Apple is still staying quiet on exactly what will be announced - but, if you look at the invitation, a certain shadow manages, without saying a word, to confirm the iPhone 5 is real, and just weeks away.

The invite: Apple's minimalist invitation asks people to attend the San Francisco launch event on the 12th - and the shadow of a five forms underneath

The invitation offers a clue that the fifth version of the popular iPhone could be in the pipeline.

The invitation says 'It's almost here'.

A large number 12 on the invite, corresponding to the date of the event, casts a shadow of a number 5.

The event will take place at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the site where Apple has unveiled various past products such as the iPad.

The new handset has been the subject of astonishing online rumours, with a plethora of supposed leaks showing everything from batteries to motherboards.

And in recent days, the leaks have become more common, with the most recent showing a supposedly working iPhone 4 being switched on.

However, despite all the speculation, Apple has refused to confirm any details of the new handset - indeed, it has even refused to admit it is launching one.

However, the majority of the leaks point to two major updates to the iconic handset - a 4 inch screen using a new type on thin display, and a new connector.
