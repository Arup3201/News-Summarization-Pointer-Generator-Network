A Lebanese man has been arrested after a sickening video emerged showing him wielding a knife and threatening to behead three Syrian refugee children left in his care.

The footage, which was filmed in Lebanon's southern Nabatiyeh province, shows three terrified children sobbing uncontrollably as the man shouts and thrusts a large knife in their direction.

At one point the man cruelly asks who he should behead first - to which the traumatised children, the eldest of which appears to be no more than seven years old, respond by pointing at each other.

Lebanese security officials said a man was detained at the weekend over the incident pending further investigation, adding that the children's mother - who has reportedly confessed to enjoying the 'sick joke' - was also briefly detained before being released.

Sickening: The footage, which was filmed in Lebanon's southern Nabatiyeh province, shows three terrified children sobbing uncontrollably as the man shouts and thrusts a large knife in their direction

Traumatic: Lebanese security officials said a man was detained at the weekend over the incident pending further investigation, but added that the children's mother has confessed to enjoying the 'sick joke'

The footage, which was uploaded to YouTube on Friday, shows three young children - a girl and two boys - crying and cowering in fear as a man stands over them shouting and holding a knife.

As well as verbally abusing the young children, he also repeatedly asks them which one he should behead first - to which they respond by sobbing uncontrollably and pointing at one another in fear.

A security official said the video proved to be a 'sick joke,' and that the Syrian refugee children had been left in the Lebanese man's care by their mother, his neighbour, while she was out at work.

'The intelligence branch of the Internal Security Forces has detained the man who made the video,' said the police official, adding that the incident had taken place in the southern Nabatiyeh province.

A security forces statement added that the children's mother was also briefly detained.

'At the very end of the filming, the mother arrived from work and [said she] enjoyed the scene and asked [her neighbour] to send her the video.'

The woman was released shortly afterwards, after pledging to treat her children better.

While describing the incident as 'an isolated incident,' the official said the video was yet another sign of the effect of the Syrian war on Lebanese society.

Lebanon hosts more than 1.1 million Syrian refugees, and fighting related to the conflict frequently breaks out in the tiny Middle Eastern country.

Last month, Sunni militants took a number of Lebanese soldiers and police hostage after clashes.

They subsequently beheaded two of the soldiers, and widely distributed images of their corpses.

'We call on everyone to make sure we maintain our awareness, but of course this video shows the depth of the impact of the Syrian crisis,' said the police official.

'People are affected by seeing images of beheadings, and some people will start to imitate them. Poor children; they were terrified,' he added.
