The future of Thibaut Courtois remains uncertain after Atletico Madrid agreed to sign Getafe goalkeeper Miguel Angel Moya on a three-year contract.

Chelsea stopper Courtois has impressed during his three years on loan in the Spanish capital and played in Atletico's Champions League final defeat to rivals Real last month.

However, it is unclear whether Courtois will remain in Spain or return to London next season following Atletico's move for a new stopper.

Uncertain: Moya's arrival has cast doubt over the future of Thibaut Courtois

The La Liga champions announced the deal on the club's official website and said: 'Atletico Madrid and Getafe have reached an agreement for the transfer of Miguel Angel Moya to our entity, pending the goalkeeper undergoing the corresponding medical examination and signing his contract.'

Local media reports suggest Atletico have paid close to £2.5million to secure the services of Moya.

The 30-year-old will be presented to the media on Thursday having completed his medical on Wednesday.

'It is still to be cleared up whether Courtois is leaving or not but it is a challenge for me and I am convinced I am up to the task,' Moya said in an interview with Spanish television.

'Atleti have become the envy of everyone, achieving what they have,' he added. 'Who wouldn’t want to come here?'

Moya is Atletico’s second signing of the summer after the club signed Argentinian frontman Angel Correa from San Lorenzo on a five-year contract.
