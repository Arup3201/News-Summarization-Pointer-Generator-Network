A man who drove from Missouri to Maine in a car packed with weapons while on the hunt for his ex-wife has been convicted of interstate stalking.

Stalker: Benjamin Lee, 52, was convicted Monday of driving 1,500 miles to stalk ex-wife Tawny Lee and her boyfriend

In Sept 2012 in a borrowed car filled with three loaded guns, two unloaded rifles, a bayonet, a machete, a folding knife, handcuffs, plastic sheeting, latex gloves and camouflage face paint, Benjamin Lee drove from Springfield, MO., to Limerick, ME., and drove back and forth in front of her house.

The disturbed man was arrested a short distance from the home, charged with interstate stalking and convicted Monday after a five day trial, according to reports.

Convicted by a jury of six men and six women in US District Court in Portland, Mr Lee, 52, faces up to five years in prison for his chilling 1,500 mile ride.

Tawny Lee was notified by Stella Lee, one of Mr Lee’s sisters, that he had disappeared from Missouri and could be on his way to Maine to harm her, according to testimony.

‘Once he was well enough, he borrowed a car that Tawny would not recognize, that she would not be looking for,’ Assistant U.S. Attorney Darcie McElwee, said in her closing argument.

The last two updates made April 26 to Mr Lee's Facebook page read only 'tawny lee.'

Terrified: Ms Lee and now-husband Tim Mann called 911 while Mr Lee tormented them by pacing back and forth in front of their home in a white Cadillac

The horrified couple noticed a white 
Cadillac pacing back and forth on their street soon after and 
immediately called 911, they testified in court. 

Mr Lee chose to remain in custody until last week’s trial, according to reports.

Prosecutors detailed to the jury repeated death threats made by Mr Lee to ex-wife Tawny Lee and then-boyfriend Timothy Mann in the immediate aftermath of her leaving him in April 2012, reports said.

Ms Lee walked out on her ailing husband only one month after his accident – for a high school boyfriend, according to testimony cited by the Kennebec Journal, but those death threats were blamed  by the defense on Mr Lee’s altered mental state during his recovery.

‘The emails sent before that made no sense and were a product of Mr. Lee's extremely poor health,’ defense lawyer James Clifford argued.

Witnesses testifying for the defense countered the troubled Mr Lee made those threats while under the influence of strong pain killers while undergoing several surgeries to repair his broken back after a car accident, according to the Journal. The accident was in March 2012.

Also blamed for his erratic behavior by his defense were diabetes and a heart condition, the Journal noted.

Explaining that the altered mental state was the result of ‘extremely low blood sugar,’ Dr Christine Irish said that ‘his diabetes was being poorly controlled during this time.’

The sickly Lee even went into diabetic shock May 20, 2012, causing him to lose consciousness, according to sister Linda Watson.

‘I didn’t think he would live,’ Ms Watson testified.

Mr Clifford also argued that Mr Lee drove away under his own free will and was arrested five miles from the home, reported the Portland Press Herald.

‘Are we to believe that he drove 1,500 miles simply to drive by the house?’ Ms McElwee asked during her rebuttal to the defense's closing arguments cited by the Press Herald. ‘You can infer from other circumstances in the case that he intended to return to the home at a later point in time.’

The jury appears to have taken Ms McElwee’s advice, their conviction carries up to a five year sentence in federal prison.

Tawny Lee married Tim Mann in the time between their terrified 911 call and the trial.

Mr Lee has 14 days to appeal.
