Her face etched with anxiety, the sister of British drug mule Lindsay Sandiford waits outside Bali’s notorious Kerokoban jail as a spate of executions for Western prisoners looms.

Hilary Parsons arrived with three lawyers today in a bid to save the 58-year-old grandmother, who was convicted of trying to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine in 2012, from the firing squad.

Ms Parsons’ dash to the Indonesian island was spurred by what appears to be the imminent threat of execution for the two Australian ringleaders of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling ring, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

Visitor: Ms Parsons, pictured, arrived at the island jail with three lawyers to speak to her condemned sister

She arrived at the prison as representatives of Indonesia’s legal department were meeting Australian officials in Jakarta, where the executions of Chan and Sukumaran were in the final stages of preparation.

‘It’s like they will be transferred to the place where they will face the firing squad in a matter of days,’ said Tony Spontana, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Attorney-General.

‘Maybe this week…hopefully. We’re already at the stage of planning the executions and these must be implemented.’

With the threat of death now close for the Australian pair, Ms Parsons’ fears for her sister’s life are understood to have increased dramatically.

She declined to make any comment when she arrived at Kerobokan prison today.

Her sister was convicted of trying to smuggle cocaine through Bali airport in 2012.

Recently-elected President Joko Widodo has announced that he will show no mercy for people sentenced to death for serious drug offences.

So far he has held to his word with the execution last month of six prisoners for drug-linked offences.

However, the Attorney General’s Department has made it clear that no-one will be put to death until they have exhausted every possible legal avenue - and that is where Ms Parsons’ hopes hang.

It is understood grandmother Mrs Sandiford, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, has one last legal attempt at saving her own life and that is to ask for a judicial review of her case.

Knitting: Mrs Sandiford has been languishing on death row since being convicted of drugs smuggling in 2012

Hearings: The grandmother has faced a string of courts in her bid to be saved from the death penalty, which was not requested by prosecutors. She insisted she carried the drugs because her son was threatened

She has already received a letter from the prosecutor’s office in Bali's capital, Denpasar, pointing out her rights to lodge what is known as a PK application - an appeal for a judicial review.

But the British government has refused to give her any funds to employ a lawyer and she told friends last month that without a local legal expert she has no idea how to conduct the process.

Ms Parsons told News Corporation recently that her family were ‘terrified’ at what lay ahead.

At the prison today Ms Parsons was accompanied by two Indonesian lawyers and a legal representative from Australia. It was not clear who was paying them.

Long fight: Mrs Sandiford was arrested in May 2012

Early 2012: Lindsay Sandiford, who was born in Yorkshire and had been living in Gloucester, sets up home in India.

May 17 2012: Mrs Sandiford allegedly meets two members of a drug syndicate in Bangkok, Thailand, and collects a suitcase packed with 4.8 kilos of cocaine.

May 19: She flies to Denpasar airport, the main airport on Bali, where customs officials X-ray the suitcase and find the drugs. She is arrested.

May 20: She is interrogated by drug squad officers who suggest it will be in her interest to tell all she knows about the syndicate. She agrees. 

August: She is moved to Kerobokan prison, where, because she is so important to the police case, she is held in solitary confinement.

Early September: She is believed to have written to the British Embassy and Indonesian government officials claiming she is being badly treated and does not have enough food or water.

September 27: Mrs Sandiford makes her first court appearance, accused of drug trafficking. She is tearful and covers her head with a scarf, maintaining that she had agreed to carry the suitcase because her son Elliot, 21, was being threatened by a drug gang.

December: She is convicted but her lawyers plead for leniency because of her co-operation. The prosecution say they want her jailed for 15 years, rather than receive a death sentence.

January 14 2013: In a 'last chance' hearing, her lawyer pleads for even less than the 15 years because her son was being threatened and she was coerced into carrying the cocaine.

January 22: She, her lawyer and even the prosecution are stunned by the death sentence, after one of the judges said she had brought a bad reputation to Bali's tourism.

January 28: The grandmother files her formal appeal against the sentence, which was imposed after judges said there were no mitigating circumstances in her favour. 

April 8: Bali's High Court upholds Mrs Sandiford's conviction after British well-wishers raise thousands of pounds to pay her legal fees. She appeals to the country's Supreme Court.

August 30: Bali's Supreme Court upholds the decision to have her shot. She languishes in Kerobokan prison with only two hopes remaining - that she receives clemency directly from the Indonesian president, or that the country's Supreme Court agrees to reopen the case.

July 16 2014: Britain's Supreme Court rejects a bid by Mrs Sandiford to have the UK government pay her legal bills, but the five judges say there are 'serious issues' about the quality of Sandiford's trial and there should be an 'urgent review of the policy as it applies to her'.

November: Her hopes for clemency from the Indonesian president are dashed as newly-elected Joko Widodo reiterates his zero-tolerance stance against drug smugglers.

February 2 2015: Indonesia reveals the two Australian ringleaders of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling ring, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, will be the next to be executed. 

February 7: It emerges Mrs Sandiford has been notified that she is formally listed for execution.

February 16: Mrs Sandiford's sister Hilary Parsons returns to Kerobokan prison with three lawyers as part of a last-ditch attempt to secure her freedom.
