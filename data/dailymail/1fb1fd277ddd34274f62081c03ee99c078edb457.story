The egg-thrower may have stolen the show, but she faced some intense competition from Amanda Holden. Or, more precisely, her choice of revealing outfits.

For the final the 42-year-old actress wore a plunging sequined J'Anton dress.

But as she turned to whisper something to fellow judge Alesha Dixon the neckline slipped, exposing rather more than she might have intended to the viewers at home.

Unfazed by the wardrobe malfunction, Miss Holden later changed into an even skimpier number for the show’s after-party.

Grinning as she jumped from a car at the 45 Park Lane club in Mayfair, she once again managed to be the centre of attention in the halterneck outfit, which gaped at the sides.

Miss Holden appeared comfortable in the short dress, which was both backless and had cutaway panels around the waist.

She was joined there by Miss Dixon, who went for a more low-key look by teaming skin-tight leather-look leggings and a loose-fitting orange T-shirt.

In sartorial contrast, Simon Cowell dressed for the live show in his usual uniform of jeans, partly buttoned white shirt and black blazer.

And he did not appear to change for the after-party – apart from ditching his egg-spattered jacket.

Saturday night’s final saw favourites Attraction crowned the winners 
while disabled teen comedian Jack Carroll came in as runner-up.
