Danny Wilson has been sacked by Barnsley - less than two months after he celebrated his 1,000th game as a manager.

The decision comes off the back off Tuesday night's 2-1 home defeat by Fleetwood Town which has left the Tykes 17th in the League One table.

Wilson returned to Oakwell for a second stint in charge in December 2013 but could not prevent the club's relegation from the Championship.

Barnsley are only seven points off the play-off places in a top-heavy League One table but have lost six of their last nine games.

Wilson's assistant Chris Hutchings - who managed Bradford and Wigan in the Premier League - has also left Oakwell, meaning head of academy coaching Mark Burton and senior development coach Paul Heckingbottom will take charge of Saturday’s match at Crawley.

Explaining the decision, a club statement read: 'Danny joined the club at a very difficult time which was a testament to his character and affection for the club – all the while demonstrating the utmost professionalism during his time with the club. Danny will always be welcome back at Oakwell.

'The success he brought during his initial period with the club is unrivalled and the club will be forever grateful for his achievements.

'However, recent performances and results have been concerning, considering the club currently boasts the fifth highest wage bill in League One in addition to a fourth highest equity donation by our owner.

'Meanwhile, our current League position of 17th is in stark contrast to an average home gate of sixth-best in the division. Whilst the club acknowledges there has been a large turnover of players, the league position is still unacceptable considering all of the above.'

The Yorkshireman was named LMA manager of the year in 1997 after winning promotion to the Premier League during his first spell at Oakwell.

Wilson, 53, has also managed Bristol City, MK Dons, Hartlepool, Swindon and Sheffield United in a 21-year managerial career.
