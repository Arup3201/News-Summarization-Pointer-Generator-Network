An ambulance rushing to the aid of Claudia Schiffer's mother-in-law after she fatally collapsed at home was deliberately blocked by a motorist.

Kathy Ceaton, mother of the German model's successful film director and producer husband Matthew Vaughn, tragically died after she was found unconscious.

The mother-of-two was discovered by her youngest son Pascha Saigol who called 999 and desperately tried to revive the former socialite, 66, on Sunday afternoon.

Despite other emergency vehicles getting to the scene unobstructed, paramedics were unable to help the former BBC TV producer who is believed to have suffered from a heart-attack.

Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels director Mr Vaughn, 42, and his half- brother Mr Saigol, 32, paid tribute to their 'beloved mother'.

In a statement the devastated family said: 'Kathy Megan Ceaton, beloved mother of Matthew Vaughn and Pasha Saigol died on Sunday, July 21, aged 66 years.

'Her intelligence, generosity, loyalty and friendship will be missed by many.'

Mr Saigol, the son of Miss Ceaton's ex-husband Pakistani millionaire Javaid Saigol, added: 'She was a successful television producer. She did some extraordinary work.

'She was kind, generous and loving to everyone she knew and she had a multitude of friends.'

He also thanked the emergency crews for their help and said that the obstruction to the ambulance had not contributed his mother's sudden death.

Mr Vaughn, who directed hit films Kick Arse and Snatch, married blonde Claudia Schiffer in 2002 and has three children with the model.

His mother reportedly single-handedly raised Mr Vaughn who was long thought to have been the product of her relationship with 70s heart-throb, Robert Vaughn. It later emerged he was actually fathered by aristocrat George de Vere Drummond.

Neighbours said that Miss Ceaton, once a glamorous society beauty and the daughter of electrical and property tycoon James Ceaton, had kept to herself and suffered from various health problems.

Her modest life in Thame, Oxfordshire, was a far cry from the glamorous lifestyle she enjoyed in the 1970s during which she lived in Robert Vaughn's Beverly Hills mansion and hosted A-list parties.

Police are now looking for the motorist who blocked one of two ambulances rushing to her top floor flat in the centre of Thame on the A418.

The double-manned ambulance was on 'blues and twos' when it was held-up by a man driving a silver Vauxhall Astra who refused to move out of the way.

A spokesman for South Central Ambulance Service said a community first responder, two ambulances and an air ambulance were dispatched to the address.

'One of the double-manned ambulances making its way to the scene was unnecessarily delayed due to another road user who refused to pull over and allegedly made rude gestures at the crew,' he said.

'We have informed Thames Valley Police and are obviously seeking a prosecution for obstructing an emergency vehicle en-route to an emergency.'

The spokesman said that the delay in the neighbouring village of Haddenham did not affect the tragic outcome as other emergency vehicles had got to the scene unobstructed.

Sergeant Ian Baldock, who is investigating into the incident, said: 'The ambulance was on its way to an emergency call in Thame town centre when the incident happened.

'We have identified the car involved and are now in the process of carrying out an investigation to establish the full circumstances.'

A spokesman for the AA said: 'The vast majority of drivers know that its common sense to make room for emergency vehicles to get past because one day it could be them that needs help and that is the stupidity of what the driver did.' Â
