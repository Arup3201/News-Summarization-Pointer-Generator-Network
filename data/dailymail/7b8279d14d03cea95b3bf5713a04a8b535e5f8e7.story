Kenneth Bright , 91, who risked his life on the beaches at Normandy, has been told he can get into the 70th anniversary event for free after initially being asked to fork out £27.50

A war museum who denied a D-Day veteran free entry to an event marking the 70th anniversary of the invasion have finally agreed to waive his fee.

But Kenneth Bright, 91, said the offer has come too late and maintains he is still not going to the event.

As part of the Royal Navy’s Landing Craft Infantry, Mr Bright helped ferry troops to the Normandy beaches on June 6 1944, when more than 5,000 Allied troops were killed.

He was initially told he would have to pay the full £27.50 to attend a special airshow at the Imperial War Museum, Duxford.

Members of the public then came forward and offered to pay for the war hero's entrance fee.

Now staff at the venue reversed their decision after hearing 'feedback.'

Hearing the museum had changed their mind, Mr Bright said: ''That is very nice of them, but that wasn't the purpose of the exercise.

'They should have invited the veterans to the event and offered tickets at a concession price to us.

'That would have been a much better approach.

'They haven't given me enough notice and my daughter can't drive me there that day so I won't be going.'

Mr. Bright, a great-grandfather-of-13 from Cambridge, said he was annoyed he can only get a seniors concession when under-15s are allowed in for free.

Before the offer, he said: 'We were there on D-Day but we can’t even get a discount.

'There aren’t many of us left so surely it’s not asking too much to let us in?

'I’m upset that they did not invite us in for free, or at least offer concessions.

Mr Bright (pictured second left with fellow troops in 1945) said: 'There aren't many of us left so surely it's not asking too much to let us in?'

'After all the whole thing is about the veterans and it’s us being shown off to the world.'

Widow
 Gillian Turner, from Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, whose D-Day veteran 
husband Ken died last year, said: 'I think the veterans should get some 
sort of concession.

'They did a lot for this country and I think they deserve it.'

The event will feature an air show of wartime planes.

A spokeswoman for the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, said: 'We
 have listened to feedback and now realise that on this special occasion
 it is more appropriate to make an exception for our D-Day veterans, and
 we would be delighted to welcome them at IWM Duxford this weekend 
without charge.'

A spokesman for the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, said there were concessions for seniors for day to day admissions, but not during air shows
