Heartwarming: Yvonne Lavasidis, 42, who owns the Dairy Queen in Markham, Ontario, Canada, was brought to tears after she read this letter from her former employee Dr Nahiba Islam, it has now gone viral 

The note from Dr Nahiba Islam thanked her old boss for her kindness, support and allowing her to study for her medical admission tests (MCAT) when no customers were around.

It read: 'Dear Yvonne, Well, I'm a doctor now! It's taken me a long time, I know, to come back around to Dairy Queen but I have thought of you and your kindness often,' the note reads. 

'You are an incredible boss and an even better human being. Thank you for supporting and encouraging me, for BBQing halal chicken for me, and allowing me to study for my MCAT's in the back when no customers were around. Much love, Nabiha'

After the letter was shared by her husband on social media, it has now gone viral.  

'Obviously I was so very touched,' Lavasidis told ABC News. 'I was in tears when I read the note for the first time, and every time I read it, it still brings tears to my eyes.'

'Incredible boss': Mrs Lavasidis said she was 'very touched' by the note and cries every time she reads it 

'She was a wonderful employee and so bright and one of those kids that you know will be exceptional and find success,' she said. 

'I have so many young successful kids. I have one who's a nurse at the local hospital, but she'll take the occasional shift just for the fun of it, if you can believe that. It's just a nice atmosphere for working.' 

She added that she likes to create a relaxed atmosphere for staff by throwing parties for them and hosting BBQs in the back. 

'I work in the store with the staff and have the opportunity to really get to know each person, so it’s a nice thing to see that young people who have found success take the time to take a pen and write a note. It’s so thoughtful.'
