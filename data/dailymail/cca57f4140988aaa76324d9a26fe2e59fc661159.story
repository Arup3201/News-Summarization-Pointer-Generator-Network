One of Britain's poshest social housing projects is being rented to wealthy holidaymakers because it is too expensive for tenants desperate for somewhere to live.

The £200,000 apartment, in a Georgian block in the heart of Bath, is now let to tourists for £700 per week despite 3,500 people being on the city council's housing waiting list.

This fully-furnished, one-bedroom property, is also available at £450 for a three-night stay, and has already received rave reviews online.

Welcome to paradise: This apartment at Sydney Place in Bath is being let as a holiday apartment by social housing giants Curo

Financial plan: A social housing giant has caused controversy after launching a programme to rent their properties to tourists

Change of plan: Curo decided to start a pilot scheme letting houses out as holiday homes after it was decided they were unaffordable and unsuitable for usual tenants

The company that owns it, Curo, admits that the flat was once used for social housing but would not say when it was refurbished.

In an apparent UK first, the firm has launched the scheme after deciding some of their properties were unaffordable and unsuitable for potential tenants.

Victor da Cunha, chief executive of Curo, said the scheme was designed to make the most out of the 12,000 properties the company owns across the West Country.

He said: 'Bath's status as a top city break destination has enabled Curo to explore whether using a small number of our properties as holiday lets we can generate income to re-invest in building much-needed, modern and affordable homes for local people.

'If this project is successful it will mean we can avoid selling properties which would otherwise not be viable for Curo to retain.'

Trial: Bosses are testing the new scheme with a Georgian flat which costs holidaymakers up to £700 per stay

Beautiful: This perfectly manicured garden was originally meant for social housing tenants but the business running them has decided against renting it to them

Mr. da Cunha added that the layout of 
the ground-floor flat and cost of heating it all year round made it 
impractical for tenants on low incomes.

The
property is equipped with a TV and DVD player, wi-fi, iPod docking 
station, fitted kitchen, private garden and its own parking space.

The
flat has already had its first guests and has received a four-star Gold
Standard by Quality in Tourism, the assessment service for Visit 
England.

Room with a view: It overlooks one of Bath's 
most exclusive streets and with its luxury bathroom it has to be one of 
the glitziest social home ever

Dramatic: The apartment is in the heart of Bath, widely considered on of Britain's most beautiful cities because of its Georgian architecture built from local stone

Speaking on the
Bath Holiday Rental site, Edward, who was the first visitor to stay in 
the apartment said: 'It's a beautifully decorated period apartment which
I found completely relaxing and equipped with every conceivable modern 
appliance to make my life easy.

'The
position in Bath is perfect; walking down Great Pulteney Street to the 
city centre is like being in the middle of the most beautiful film set.

'Great to be the first Guest ever to use it!'

Curo hope if the pilot is successful they will be able to use more of their homes as holiday lets.
