Danniella Westbrook has fled to the States to start a three-month course of rehabilitation in a new attempt to kick her drug demons. 

The actress left the UK on Saturday night, before a Sunday newspaper broke the news that she was once again using cocaine. 

In the tell-all interview, she revealed that she had turned to the highly-addictive drug six times since the relationship with her toy boy fiance Tom Richards, 24, started to break down in April and had even ended up sleeping with her drug dealer.

Speaking on This Morning, Danniella Westbrook broke down in tears while discussing the effects of her drugs relapse 

Danniella initially got teary after revealing her family's attitude to her drugs relapse 

Danniella apologised for crying on the TV show, claiming her children would be annoyed with her for getting teary 

Today, the 40-year-old broke down in tears as she appeared on This Morning to talk to hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford about the struggles she has faced since picking up the class A drug again this year and how it has almost ruined her life once more. 

She said: 'I'm not where I was with drugs (at my lowest point), but it was a case of how long it would be until I was  - that's what I was really frightened about. 

'I spoke to a family member a couple of weeks before it came out and said I was scared of relapsing. 

'Then soon as my agent got a call saying the story is breaking, I told him I needed to get help. 

'The newspapers have done me a favour - the first thing I said to the journalist was, "thank you very much because you've done me a huge favour."

'They helped because the thing I was most frightened of saying was that I was doing drugs, I was most fearful about how I'd cope with the backlash of everything if I came out about it. 

'It has been a huge weight lifted for me.

'I've had a terrible time in the last year, which is no excuse, but I've just felt so broken and a lot of the time have been on the verge of breakdown.

'I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, I was weak and took drugs and I'm ashamed of that.' 

The mother-of-two blamed her relapse on an incredibly difficult last year that had seen the breakdown of her marriage and the loss of her family home. 

She had also been thrust into the limelight after revealing last year that she had been the victim of a gang rape in 1994 during the height of her initial drug use. 

She said: ' I knew what I was doing was wrong, I know that when I started drinking when things got heavier for me that it was inevitable that I would pick up drugs, it was just a question of when.

'The people around me could see it too.

'I thought I could be the one percent of people who would never pick up drugs again and I was wrong. 

'This last year has been a big deal for me; losing my marriage was hard for me, being robbed, losing my house, moving my kids into a bedsit, it was all very hard for me. 

'I thought talking about the rape would be a good thing for me and I've actually really not dealt with it very well either.' 

Danniella then broke down into tears as she revealed the terrible effect being back on cocaine has had on her relationship with her family. 

She said: 'I told my mum three weeks ago at her house but I haven't spoken to her since. 

'My younger brother  - I spoke to him this morning and I know I've broken his heart.   

'Drugs are always evil.'

The star escaped the country on Saturday night, just a couple of hours before the news of her relapse hit the news stands. 

Pictured here in March before the relapse, Danniella had been clean for several years and many believed she had managed to turn her life around 

She has spent the last few days reconnecting with her religion, getting therapy and attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings. 

She said: 'I knew when the story broke that I needed to get back to America, to be with the church. 

'The first time I got clean was here in the U.S. 12 years ago.

'When I arrived in the country on Saturday night, my pastor's wife picked me up and I was in church the next morning, then back in again that evening and I'll be back there tonight. 

'I'm not actually in (residential) rehab, I'm staying at a house, but I'm doing a lot of meetings here and I know a lot of people here with a lot of clean time - like 30 years. 

'There are also a lot of people in meetings who have been clean and relapsed who are within recovery again, so it's a place where recovery is celebrated.  

Danniella's initial addiction to cocaine led to her nasal septum rotting away 

'So I'm seeing therapists, going to meetings and feeling hugely positive. 

'I think where I went wrong was I didn't stay in meetings or therapy, I haven't been in meetings for six years.

'So now I think I've resorted to the knowledge that I will need it in my life day-to-day, always.' 

In the late 1990s, Danniella was warned that she would die in the space of two weeks if she did not quit her £400-a-day cocaine binges.

Her addiction led to her being sacked from her role as Sam Mitchell on EastEnders and she suffered from several overdoses during her battle with the drug.

She famously snorted such industrial amounts of cocaine that her nasal septum completely rotted away and had to have a pioneering operation which involved an implant of shark cells to repair her nose.

Danniella also lost three teeth because of her habit, while others crumbled under the chemical onslaught.
