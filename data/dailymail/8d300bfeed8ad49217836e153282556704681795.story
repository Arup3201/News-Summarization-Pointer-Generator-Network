Carlos Gutierrez passed out as the large blade cut through his legs. He was being punished by a Mexican gang for his refusal to pay extortion fees from his successful catering business in Chihuahua.

Four men forced him into the back of his vehicle at a local park in the northern Mexico city before slicing just under his knees. Gutierrez spent two weeks in critical condition. As soon as he was able, he sought asylum in Texas.

Now, Gutierrez, 35, is facing long odds on getting approval to stay in the US. The US government allows asylum for those who have credible fear of persecution based on their race, religion, national origin, political status or membership in a particular social group.

Gutierrez, a Mexican asylum seeker who fled to the U.S. after extortionists cut his legs off for not paying the extortion fees, is riding his bike from El Paso to Austin, Texas, to raise awareness on the situation of political asylum seekers.

But Mexican asylum seekers have struggled to convince U.S. courts they fit in any of these categories, with approval rates running 1 to 2 percent. By contrast, more than a fourth of immigrants from other Latin American countries such as Colombia and Venezuela were granted asylum last year. Many can cite ethnic or political grounds.

Gutierrez has been working to raise awareness and call attention to his plight and to the thousands of other Mexicans who seek asylum in the U.S. each year from drug cartel violence, with little success. He's getting stranger's attention by riding his bicycle through Texas using his prosthetic legs and talking to everyone he meets.

'If someone from Cuba or from Venezuela can get asylum, why not someone from Mexico?' said Gutierrez, who spent nearly two weeks on his 800-mile bicycle trek from El Paso to Austin,Texas.

Since he hopped on his bicycle in El Paso on Oct. 28, Gutierrez has been making his case for a change in the system. Along the way townspeople came out from shops and houses to wave and talk with him during rest stops. He endured rain, strong winds, flat tires and fatigue. On the fifth day, a prosthetic specialist met him to adjust his legs because he was bruising and blistering.

'There were times when we thought it'd be best to have him rest, to drive him to the next town to let his legs recover, but he'd say, `No,' said Jaqueline Armendariz, a member of the support team for the ride to Austin. 'He has a mission.'

Gutierrez said he never considered quitting.

It doesn't matter, he said, 'how grave your wound was. What matters is that you get up. I have no legs, but I am on my feet.'

The US Executive Office for Immigration Review did not specifically comment on Gutierrez's case. However, immigration judges have acknowledged in court that asylum cases based on fear of crime or violence are difficult to make.

'I believe everything you just told me,' immigration Judge Stephen Ruhle told a Mexican applicant at a recent hearing in which the man described being targeted by corrupt police officers for extortion money. 'But asylum is not applicable to cases like yours.'

Some scholars have argued that many applicants should qualify under a looser definition of 'social group.' A 2010 report by the United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees said people who, on principle, refuse to pay extortion could be considered a group.

Other experts say the threats to individuals have evolved since asylum categories were defined in treaties after World War II.

'Now, people are fleeing different forms of persecution,' said Karen Musalo, director of the Center for

Philip Schrag, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University, said many applications come from Mexicans who have been apprehended crossing illegally into the US

The Texas-Mexico boarder. Carlos Gutierrez fled to Texas after a Mexican gang cut off his legs. He's been riding his bicycle through Texas using his prosthetic legs, talking to everyone he meets in hopes of convincing the American people and government that he deserves to stay.

'Many come seeking employment but are not threatened,' he said.

Gutierrez has worked in a burrito shop to help support his wife and children while his case goes through the system.

He said he has put his life in Chihuahua behind him.

'I'd rather think about the future,' he said.
