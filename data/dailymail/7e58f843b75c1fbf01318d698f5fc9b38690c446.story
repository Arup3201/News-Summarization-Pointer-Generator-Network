Fewer than five per cent of executives appointed by top companies in the past two years have been female.

While Britain’s biggest companies may have heeded calls to end the male dominance of boardrooms, there is a new glass ceiling in place which means women are not getting top executive positions.

There are currently only 20 female executive directors employed by Britain's 100 biggest firms, new figures show.

Glass ceiling: Women are not getting top executive positions despite Government moves to encourage companies to recruit more senior women

Despite moves by the Government to 
encourage large companies to recruit more senior women, only four out of
the 87 chief executives appointed by FTSE 100 companies in the past two
years were female.

According to data compiled by BoardWatch, which tracks the appointments of females to UK boards, none of the 18 executives who joined FTSE 100 boards this year has been a woman.

The figures could prompt calls for Britain’s biggest companies to face quotas to recruit more women at senior management positions.

Listed companies in the share index include Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Vodafone Group, Aviva and Royal Bank of Scotland.

Experts said the recent figures show companies are not doing enough to nurture women at an earlier stage of their careers.

6.5% of FTSE 100 executives are women (up from 5.5% in January 2011)

16.7% of FTSE 100 directors are women

91 board seats needed to hit Lord Davies’ target

4.6% of executives appointed by FTSE 100 companies in last two years female

0% of executives who joined FTSE 100 boards this year were women

Jane Scott, UK head of the 
Professional Boards Forum, which compiles the BoardWatch data, said the 
lack of female executive appointments was ‘great cause for concern’.

Ms Scott told The Times: ‘The pipeline in the executive world seems to be broken.'

Only
6.5 per cent of executive directors, such as chief executives and 
finance directors, in the FTSE 100 are women, according to recruitment 
consultancy Norman Broadbent. This drops to 4.5 per cent in the FTSE 
200, the next tier.

The 
number of FTSE 100 female executives has increased from 5.6 per cent, the 
level before Lord Davies of Abersoch published his Women on Boards 
report in February 2011.

But while there has been a hike, experts say the increase has been slow.

The
last woman appointed to a top management role at a FTSE 100 company was
Tracy Robbins, who was made human resources director of 
Intercontinental Hotels Group in August last year, said Neil Holmes, 
director at Norman Broadbent, to The Times.

And of those companies in the FTSE 250, not a single woman executive has been appointed in the last three months.

Lord Davies of Abersoch was appointed by ministers to investigate the lack of women in boardrooms.

His report published last year called upon FTSE 100 companies to reach a minimum target of 25 per cent of female representation on the board by 2015.

He rejected the option of setting quotas, which exist in countries such as Norway.

The listed companies have stepped up their hiring of female non-executives.

Since March, a year-on from the release of the report, 24 women have been appointed to FTSE 100 boards and only 20 men.

As a result, the overall proportion
of female directors has risen from 12.5 per cent before the Davies report to
16.7 per cent.

Rare: The overall proportion of female directors has risen to 16.7 per cent but the number of female executives being appointed still has a long way to go

In 1999 just 6.9 per cent of directors in the FTSE index of Britain's 100 biggest firms were women.

Experts believe that the report’s targets are on track to be met
ahead of the 2015 deadline.

However, of nine executives appointed since March, all were male, according to 
BoardWatch.

Ms Scott told MailOnline: 'We are now seeing a brighter spotlight directed towards the challenge of growing the pipeline of women senior executives and Executive Directors in UK businesses.

'All the companies we talk to are developing strategies to increase the ranks of senior women in their top executive teams as well as looking for gender balance and diversity in the boardroom'

Only four of Britain’s 100 biggest companies are run by women, including Angela Ahrendts at Burberry and Dame Marjorie Scardino at Pearson, the education and publishing group.

Many companies are trying to address the problem, by introducing flexible working arrangements and insisting that shortlists of potential new appointments feature women candidates.

Earlier this year a report by the School of Management at Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, said firms are good at hiring young women to junior jobs, but few make it to the top.

One female who has made it to the top is chief executive of Burberry, Angela Ahrendts.

She is one of the best-rewarded female bosses in the UK thanks to the stellar performance of the luxury group.

Burberry, famous for its distinctive red, black and beige check, has been one of the best performers in the FTSE 100 under her leadership.

She received a total of £16million last year in pay, bonuses and long-term incentive schemes that bore fruit in 2011.

Burberry said that under her leadership the company produced ‘exceptional returns’ for shareholders in a period of economic turbulence.

Last year Burberry delivered record revenue and profit, along with job creation in the UK and abroad.
