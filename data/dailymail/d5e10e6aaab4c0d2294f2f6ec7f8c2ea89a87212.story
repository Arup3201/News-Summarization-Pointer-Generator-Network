Rio Ferdinand may have left Manchester United this week – but he still seems to take the derby rivalry seriously.

The former England captain was in Singapore on a promotional tour with Manchester City and Argentina star Sergio Aguero.

City may have had the upper hand over their neighbours this season, but there was no lack of competitive spirit when the pair went head-to-head in Asia.

The pair are undergoing a number of challenges for a telecommunications company SingTel.

It had been a mixed week for the pair, as Aguero helped City lift their second Premier League title in three years with a win over West Ham on Sunday, while Ferdinand’s 12-year career at Manchester United came to an end after their 1-1 draw with Southampton.
