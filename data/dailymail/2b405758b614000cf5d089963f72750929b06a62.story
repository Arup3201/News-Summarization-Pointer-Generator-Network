Thomas Muller scored a hat-trick as the undefeated champions crushed Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 to open up a seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga.

Muller's opening goal in the 22nd-minute spelled bad news for the home side, as in the 50 previous Bundesliga games the German forward has scored, Bayern have won 47 and drawn three.

He then doubled the visitors' lead after tapping in from a Franck Ribery pass just after the hour mark, before racing clear to complete his hat-trick just three minutes later.

And Xherdan Shaqiri then came off the bench to score a late fourth. 

The victory completed an excellent week for the club, who booked their spot in the Champions League last-16 with a win over Roma in midweek.

It was the sixth win in seven league games for Bayern, who sit top of the pile on 27 points, seven clear of Wolfsburg and Borussia Monchengladbach who don't play until Sunday.
