Bedroom chic: Victoria Beckham showcased the look at the recent Wimbledon final

Flashing a bra strap a bit risque for you? Then you might want to avert your gaze now - if the catwalks are anything to go by.

Judging by the latest lines from top designers, next season the streets are going to be full of women wandering around in skimpy nighties, barely-there camisoles and all manner of lingerie-inspired looks.

Louis Vuitton's new collection is influenced by 'hotel boudoirs', while Dolce & Gabbana's campaign features barely-clad models.

Jean Paul Gaultier has sent girls down the runway in slips and corsets and Ellie Saab has dreamy white nightie-like dresses.

Always at the forefront of a trend, Victoria Beckham showcased the look at the recent Wimbledon final (right). The fashionista sported one of those bedroom chic Louis Vuitton numbers: a black, lacy slip dress that looked as if it were suitable for only the most intimate of situations.

It might be Mrs B's style - but can the rest of us really wear underwear masquerading as outerwear? Or will we always run the risk of looking as if we're emulating mid-Nineties Madonna - or have forgotten the rest of our outfit?

While the High Street versions of the catwalk looks won't hit stores until autumn, we wondered if you could get away with wearing genuine underwear as outerwear.

The looks below are almost exclusively sourced from the lingerie department. Can they really do double-duty as everyday outfits?

EVENING ENSEMBLE

This cami and skirt copies Beckham's 
Louis Vuitton dress for a fraction of the price.

It looks great, and 
looks nothing like underwear if worn with minimal heels and a 
businesslike clutch.

Keep make-up and hair natural, and try a classic 
cream jacket on top.

DISHY AT DINNER

This pink body could be worn with jeans 
in the day or a skirt for a smart dinner.

Its moulded cups and snap back
mean it is supportive but still creates curves.

Pair with a chunky 
necklace to highlight your decolletage.

CASUAL CHICS

You'd never guess this blue cami was 
underwear.

The sweet neckline and stylish fabric mean it will look great
with jeans for a casual, comfortable weekend look.

Pointy heels will 
stop it from being too saccharine. 

OK FOR THE OFFICE?

Nude shades and pencil shapes are huge 
for spring.

With a white shirt tucked in and nude heels, this slip skirt
is surprisingly smart, but it's unforgiving, so best for slim, tall 
women.

Wear nude heels that don't clash and go for minimal underwear - 
or risk VPL.

DATE NIGHT

He won't be able to take his eyes off 
you in this racy slip - Dolce & Gabbana do something very similar.

It conceals your stomach and enhances your bust thanks to its moulded 
cups.

Keep styling simple so it doesn't look over the top - if in doubt,
pop on a cardi and reveal all when you get home.

JUST FOR THE BEDROOM!

This looks lovely, but it's too shiny 
and short to be anything but a nightie, and the lacy details and bows 
are so obtrusive that you couldn't wear it outside.

It is, however, very
good quality, a great colour and light and cool, so wear it and show it
off - in your own boudoir with someone you want to impress.
