Throughout his first year as a professional, Anthony Joshua has refused to believe the hype.

But after stopping Denis Bakhtov in the second round at London's O2 Arena on Saturday night, even he may now begin to dream.

Nine fights, nine wins, nine early nights and a first title to boot. Not bad for a man who first laced up his gloves six years ago as a raw 18-year-old.

Bakhtov had not been stopped for almost a decade and had boxed a staggering 250 rounds more than his younger opponent. He was supposed to be a test.

But with a grin that would make the Cheshire Cat look solemn, Joshua clobbered the Kazakh from pillar to post.

Twelve months ago at the same venue, Joshua made his professional debut after a 12-month hiatus following his Olympic triumph.

On that occasion, he relieved Italian Emanuele Leo of his unbeaten record but a year under the watchful eye of Tony Sims has seen him grow into a menacing heavyweight.

Joshua made his customary cautious start, but it required just a handful of stiff jabs for him to throw off the shackles.

Bakhtov, a veteran of 47 fights, did at least throw back but his response was brief and limited and merely served to refocus the Watford man's mind and sharpen his weapons.

Left followed right followed left as Bakhtov's face reddened with every crushing blow while Joshua stretched a smile around his mouth guard in sheer delight.

Surviving to slump on his stool after three torrid minutes was an achievement in itself for the beleaguered visitor but his respite was cruelly short-lived.

Joshua, who is yet to go beyond the third round as a professional, laid siege immediately after the bell to start the second session.

The referee stepped in but bizarrely allowed them to continue for several seconds before rescuing the stricken and bloodied Bakhtov.

Joshua said afterwards: 'He hadn't been stopped so I just wanted to see what he could take.

'He was a strong guy and he wasn't an easy opponent but I wanted to make light work of him. It only went two rounds but I just wanted to hurt him.' 

And hurt him he did.

The WBC International belt now in his possession is little more than expensive bling.

But the accompanying world ranking and chilling power will put the heavyweight division on red alert.
