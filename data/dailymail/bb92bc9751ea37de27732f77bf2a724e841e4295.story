She triumphed at this year's BRIT Awards so it was only fitting that the toast of the ceremony headed out to celebrate,

Scottish singer Sandé simply kicked off her heels and descended into the ROC Nation after-party with one thing on her blonde quiff - celebration.

The 25-year-old former medical student took to Twitter after scooping her two awards, writing: 'If I don't party tonight... then I'll never party' and a friend shared a picture of the singer grinning as she held a glass of champagne.

Sandé, who wore a pretty clinging floral dress for the ceremony showed her down-to-earth style status by shunning the multiple outfit changes adopted by contemporaries Rita Ora and simply slipped into some navy trainers.

Sandé, whose debut alum Our Version Of Events picked up best album, looked more than happy to bask in her success after a busy summer - the married star opened the Olympic ceremony this year to critical acclaim.

Accepting her award for British Female Solo Artist - presented to her by Taylor Swift - Emeli said: 'Wow, this is amazing, this is incredible, I'm so happy to win this. I was up against so many wonderful artists.

Celebration: Emeli was ready to revel in her double BRIT success

'Thank you to my wonderful family, my mum, dad, my wonderful husband. Thank you to everyone who believed in me.'

Picking up Best Album later in the night, she added: 'I think I'm a very lucky pop star. This is an album I wrote because I didn't have the strength to say these things. The fact that people have connected with these songs doesn't make me feel so lonely.

'This is a dream really. Thank you for this award and thank you for this year.'

Lovely and leggy: Kelly Brook looked ultra-slim as she arrived for the bash in a thigh-skimming black skirt

Looking lovely: Kelly showed no sign of putting on weight as she arrived at the party - despite Katie Price's slurs earlier this month

Other famous faces at the Three Six Zero Group and ROC Nation party, at fashionable Hakkasan Hanway Place in central London included a rather leggy Kelly Brook and a rather skinny Alexa Chung.

Kelly, 33, showed no sign of 'comfort eating' as she looked ultra leggy in a thigh skimming black skirt and pretty padded detail cream blouse.

Her hair was loose around her shoulders and she accessorised with a simple silver clutch bag.

Feeling the cold: Alexa Chung went bare legged for the ceremony

Model looks: Jourdan Dunn is a British fashion model and she certainly looked the part as she arrived at Roc Nation

Alexa went bare legged as did model Jourdan Dunn who looked stunning in a full leather outfit with midriff baring top.

Meanwhile Ben was the surprise winner of the night, taking home British Male Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act.

Accepting the Breakthrough award – voted for by listeners of BBC Radio 1 - he humbly said: 'I'm not very good at speeches. I'm also not very good at dancing.'

It was all about the legs: Jourdan looked amazing as she headed into the bash

Speaking at the Winner’s press conference a little later, he added: “I was a little shell shocked to win. This is definitely the cherry on the cake.

'The year had ended, the album had been so much more successful than we’d ever thought, to be nominated for the BRITs in the first place was amazing, and to actually come away with these two is… Bizarre, I think, is the best way to describe it.'

One Direction debuted their new charity single ‘One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)’ at the show, and group lothario Harry Styles couldn’t escape a little fun being poked at him.

Sharon Osbourne - who co-presented Best International Female – said: “Where is that little Harry wizard boy? Does he have his magic stick with him? That's his willy!'

She then presented Lana Del Rey with the trophy, her second consecutive year of winning it.

Speaking at the Winner’s press conference, she said: 'I do live here and I did write the record here, so it’s exciting to win. It’s the best thing I’ve been able to do in my life. I’ve talked to the people who have listened to the music and they’ve really been supportive and helped me.'

Harry also had to suffer through watching his ex-girlfriend, Taylor Swift, perform ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ at the awards – a song widely believed to be about him. Capping off his night One Direction lost out in the Best British Group category to Mumford and Sons.

 Accepting their gong, lead singer Marcus Mumford said: 'Thank you very much indeed, we weren't really expecting that.

“We haven't ever really taken the opportunity to thank everyone who comes to our gigs. I mean we're in a category with Muse and One Direction. We love being British and we love going round the world and spreading British music.'

All was not lost however, and One Direction eventually triumphed, winning the special BRITs Global Success Award.

Meanwhile more than more than 6.5 million viewers watched the BRIT Awards on ITV, the largest audience in a decade.
