Busted: Paige Nicole Merritt, the stripper girlfriend of a Florida police officer, has been arrested for twice selling marijuana to an informant

Officials told the Sun Sentinel that a confidential informant gave word the officer and his girlfriend were dealing marijuana from their home. That person then helped implicate the two dealers.

The informant was sent to the home wearing an audio monitoring device to purchase $20 worth of marijuana, officials said. The mole spoke to the former cop and Ms Merritt before following her into the home, where he several clear plastic bags of pot on the table.

That person then returned to the stash house on Sept 23 wearing both an audio and video monitoring device, which showed Mr Rodriguez-Santiago present when $40 worth of marijuana was bought.

Armed with a warrant, cops came knocking two days later.

Police waited for Ms Merritt to leave 
home before apprehending her in a traffic stop, during which they 
smelled a strong marijuana odor coming from the car, according to an 
arrest report cited by the paper.

Ms Merritt produced two plastic bags packed with pot from her bra, said the report. She told officers she was on her way to sell the drugs at Goldfinger Gentlemen’s Club, where she worked.

Authorities searching the home found pot in multiple rooms, as as well as a scale, plastic bags, a drug grinder and smoking clips. The money used to buy the marijuana was found squirreled away in an empty Crystal Light container, according to the report.

‘The items are strong indicators that [Merritt] and co-defendant, Joseph Rodriguez-Santiago, are both currently selling narcotics,’ Detective Erik Palacio wrote in the arrest report.

Mr Rodriguez-Santiago has since resigned from the Sunrise Police Department after six years on the force.

The disgraced former officer later copped to the allegations in a taped confession. He is due in court Nov 11 on a possession charge and another for drug paraphernalia.

Ms Merrit faces two felony charges for selling to the snitch.
