When it comes to travel, there are a lot of things that affect the trips we book - and one of them could be the way we vote.

While Conservative supporters love a good trashy plane read, it seems Liberal Democrats prefer to opt for the window seat for flights, while UKIP supporters are the most likely to want to save money on holiday.

The unusual statistics were revealed as part of a Travelzoo survey into voters and their holiday habits, revealing the Greens love a long-haul trip and Labour are the most likely to try out their dance moves on holiday.

Interestingly despite their belief that pulling out of the EU is necessary, UKIP supporters still have a lot of love left for warmer climates as they are the biggest sun lovers of all the parties with 90 per cent requiring this as standard.

Cutting down on emissions and pollution is a mainstay of the Green Party's manifesto, however almost half of their supporters (49 per cent) are likely to travel on long haul destinations, preferring an aisle seat on the plane.

They are also most likely to rent a car on holiday, with 60 per cent voting to do so.

Green Party supporters are also most likely to take the toiletries home with them, while UKIP are the least likely to swoop for the free shampoo and shower gel in hotel rooms.

The Scottish National Party are the most likely to pack the speedos on holiday, while they are also the most likely to watch English TV. 

Thirty-four per cent of those who vote Liberal Democrat love cruise holidays, according to the statistics

Spokesperson for Travelzoo Louise Hodges said: 'While some of the political party stereotypes where upheld – such as Conservative supporters being the biggest fans of luxury holidays and à la carte dining – we were interested to see some less expected holiday preferences.

'We also found it interesting that UKIP supporters were the in the majority when it came to saying they liked to 'mix with locals' on foreign holidays. 

'Paradoxically they were the least keen on trying to speak the local language. And they also like a full English breakfast regardless of where they are.'
