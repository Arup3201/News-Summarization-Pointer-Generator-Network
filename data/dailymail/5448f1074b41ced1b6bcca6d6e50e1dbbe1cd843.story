'Terrible tragedy': Declan Newsome's skull was fractured when he came off his bike after clipping a car as he sped down the hill

A paperboy who died after falling from a faulty bike and fracturing his skull had been 'pedalling like billy-o' down a steep hill when he clipped a car and hit the pavement.

Declan Newsome, 15, who didn't see the car stopping ahead of him until the last moment, tried to avoid the vehicle but the brakes on his bike were 'totally ineffective', an inquest heard.

The teenager, a prefect at his school in Bradford, West Yorkshire, was not wearing a helmet.

The schoolboy lost control when he tried to swerve around the car, which had stopped in front of him to allow another vehicle to pass in the opposite direction on the narrow road.

He clipped the rear light on the Suzuki Wagon R on Hopton Lane in Mirfield, then hit another car before coming off his bike and hitting his head on the road.

He was airlifted to hospital with a fractured skull and a severe brain injury following the accident on the morning of July 9 last year. He died three weeks later at Leeds General Infirmary when his life support machine was switched off.

Coroner Roger Whittaker, who recorded a verdict of accidental death, described Declan's death as a terrible tragedy and said no-one was to blame.

The Castle Hall Academy pupil's devastated parents Kenneth and Harriet Newsome have called for speed cameras or speed bumps to be installed along Hopton Lane.

Mr Newsome, 69, said after the hearing: 'I hope the powers that be see the trauma that we have been through and get something done.

'Our son was safety conscious and looked after his bike but he lost his life, his career, his future. I want Declan never to be forgotten and something positive to come from his death,' Mr Newsome added.

The driver of the Suzuki, builder Donald MacMillan, of Holmfirth, said he had to stop behind a parked car on Hopton Lane to allow other vehicles to come up the hill.

He told the inquest the schoolboy was 'pedalling like billy-o' with his head down.

Mr MacMillan, who was stationary with his handbrake on, said: 'I could see him coming from behind and as he got close he lifted his head and saw me there. He was only 6ft or 7ft away.

'I could see him brake and the handlebars shaking,' he said.

Declan clipped the back of the Suzuki with his handlebar and hit the side of a Volkswagen Golf coming up the hill.

Driver Susan Ferguson, from Dewsbury, said she had been travelling at around 10mph when the cyclist suddenly appeared from behind the Suzuki.

Steve Green, West Yorkshire Police's principal collision investigator, said the brakes on Declan's bike were 'grossly maladjusted' and 'totally ineffective'.

He said the rear brake did not work at all and the front only partially.

The bike had a 'V-brake' system which Mr Green said was 'notoriously difficult because it needs to be set up correctly'.

He added: 'We will never know if Declan applied the brakes but if he did he could not have stopped.'

Consultant pathologist Dr Julian Ostrowski, who carried out the post-mortem, said that even if the schoolboy had been wearing a helmet it would not have prevented the injury.

During the hearing the boy's father called upon the coroner to recommend that speed restrictions be introduced in Hopton Lane, but Mr Whittaker said there was no evidence to show that speed was a factor in the incident.

'There is no evidence so, sadly, there's nothing I can do,' he said.

Mirfield Conservative councillor Vivien Lees-Hamilton is spearheading a campaign for safety improvements in Hopton Lane in the wake of the accident.

She is also helping the family to organise a campaign to make newsagents aware of their safety responsibilities to paperboys and girls.
