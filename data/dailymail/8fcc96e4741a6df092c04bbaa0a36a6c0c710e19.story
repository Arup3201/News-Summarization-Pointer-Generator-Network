It is not often a player will celebrate a success for their closest rivals, but Chelsea’s Gary Cahill appeared delighted that Manchester City had made it through to the knockout stages of the Champions League.

Before beating Roma, City were facing not only the prospect of exiting the competition but finishing bottom of their group and not even having Europa League consolation.

City are also lurking just three points behind Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League despite the Blues’ 23-match unbeaten run, which was ended last weekend by Newcastle. So Cahill saw much to be pleased about.

‘Maybe City would have rested players (had they gone out) or maybe they would have had more time to prepare for games,’ Cahill said after Chelsea’s 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon that made them the highest scoring team in the Champions League group stages with 17 goals. ‘Who knows if that will have any impact in the league?’

Chelsea have made themselves the team to beat this season, crushing opponents in that undefeated run which included victories against Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham and draws away to both Manchester clubs.

Manager Jose Mourinho has even claimed that some teams up their game against Chelsea while treating matches against other opponents as though they are friendlies.

But 15 games into the Premier League campaign City — who have lost to Stoke, West Ham and Newcastle already — are still hanging in there, waiting to strike.

Cahill has called it right. Chelsea are still fighting on four fronts — Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and Capital One Cup. If City had just the FA Cup and Premier League to play for, they would be a different, more threatening, proposition.

‘You see how close City are to us even with that unbeaten run,’ Cahill added. ‘We think about that — how hard we worked and how well everyone spoke about how we were playing but yet we’re three points in front with many games to go.’

Last season, Chelsea were 46 minutes away from the Champions League final but three goals from Atletico Madrid sent them out.

Cahill has experienced winning the Champions League with Chelsea — six months after joining in January 2012 — as well as being knocked out at the group stage with 10 points and that agonising defeat by Atletico.

‘Last year we were close but I feel that we’re going stronger this season,’ he said.

‘As a team we’ve got more experience than last season. It hurt us a lot to go out in the semi-final.’
