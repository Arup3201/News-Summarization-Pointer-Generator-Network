The teacher handed out a lesson to the pupil as Martyn Rooney, a veteran of the British team despite only being 27, beat prodigious teenager Matt Hudson-Smith and Great Britain claimed a one-two in the 400m.

Rooney had been offering advice and ‘having a laugh in the call room’ with the 19-year-old as they advanced through the rounds. But all friendly feeling was left in the blocks as he held on to win gold in 44.71sec, the fastest time in Europe this year.

Hudson-Smith finished strongly but did not have enough track left to overhaul Rooney, taking silver in a personal best time of 44.75sec. The two warmly embraced on the finish line and did a lap of honour together.

This was Britain’s first one-two in the 400m at the Europeans since Du’ane Ladejo beat Roger Black in 1994.

Hudson-Smith, from Birmingham, was formerly a 100m sprinter and only properly turned to one-lap running at the start of the year. He has since shaved an incredible one minute off his personal best.

‘To have someone to race against for the next couple of years is great,’ said Rooney, ‘It’s great for British athletics but obviously I’m ecstatic to come out on top.

‘He’s a fantastic kid and I’ve been having a bit of a laugh with him in the call room. We were a little bit more subdued before the final but still having fun. I’ve been offering him advice throughout the week. From a selfish point of view I’m glad he’s around because I think he’s going to push me to run fast.

‘I’ve been happy to let him take the spotlight this year. I said in every interview “it’s all about Matt Hudson-Smith”.’

Rooney was also 19 when he came to prominence by breaking Roger Black’s 21-year-old British junior 400 metres record at the 2006 Commonwealth Games.

Since then Rooney admits he has failed to live up to expectations and had not won a major international title until Friday night.

‘I asked myself 100 times where that form had gone,’ said Rooney, ‘The pressure put on me by others is nothing compared to what I’ve done to myself. It’s nice to be a champion now, I’ve never won anything in my life.’

Rooney claimed he was under greater pressure after pulling out of the 4x400m relay team which went on to win gold at the Commonwealth Games earlier this month.

‘I’m not a superman athlete, I’m very human and very breakable so have to make these tough decisions but by pulling out of the relay I put a big target on my back. I had to get gold here, nothing else would have done.’

Laura Weightman held on to add a European 1500m bronze medal to her Commonwealth silver. The 23-year-old, coached by Steve Cram, held off Poland’s Renata Plis down the home straight to clock a time of 4:06.32.

She said: ‘It’s been an incredible season, running four-minutes flat, the silver at the Commonwealth Games and now this.

‘Without all of Steve’s championship experience I wouldn’t be able to be so relaxed and I believe I can go out there and win those medals.’

Londoner Christine Ohuruogu missed out on a medal, finishing fourth in her 400m final.

The former world and Olympic champion was bidding to add an elusive European title to her medal collection but said she had planned 2014 as a ‘light’ year.

‘I’m disappointed to finish outside the medals but not heartbroken,’ she said. ‘I was here for something to do.

‘Training at home gets tedious so I thought I would come out and test myself. It’s foolish to have a complete year out which I would like ideally.’
