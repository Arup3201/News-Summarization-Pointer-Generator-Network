A strategically-placed GoPro camera captured the sweet moment that an excitable dog bounded down the ski slopes in pursuit of her owner. 

The video, filmed at Mt. Hood in Oregon, perfectly shows the delight and freedom Rosie experiences as she dashes after her skiing owners in a feverish frenzy.

The camera, which is attached to the dog's collar, captures the playful pup taking in the views - before taking off down the slope.

An adorable, excitable dog called Rosie loves to spend time on the ski slopes with her owners

Skiing enthusiast Nathan Siegal, rescued Rosie, a two-year-old Golden Retriever-Labrador cross in their hometown of Salt Lake City.

Nathan, 30, said: 'Rosie has skied with us three times before this one, she absolutely loves it.'

'You can hear on the video when she descends that she is going wild with excitement.'

The video of her playing with them in the snow was captured by a GoPro camera attached to her collar

Rosie is no stranger to the slopes, as she's been to the mountain with her family three times before

Despite her young age, Rosie is rapidly becoming a pro at beating her owners, often waiting at the bottom barking for them to hurry up.

And when she isn't sprinting through the snow, the hilarious hound can be seen rolling in the powder, sending the camera into a dizzying spin.

Nathan added: 'We take Rosie out as long as conditions permit.'

Rosie is quick too - in fact, she often makes it to the bottom of the hill first and waits for her owners to arrive

When she isn't bounding down the hill, Rosie can be often be found rolling around in the fresh powder

Owner Nathan Siegal says that while Rosie does love the snow, he only takes her out in very safe conditions

'When skiing in the backcountry it's critical to be aware of avalanche danger, and we would only take Rosie out with us during very safe conditions.

'One question I get a lot from non-skiing friends is, how does the dog ride the chairlift?

'But she doesn't, all of the skiing we do with the pup is human powered, skin up, ski down.'
