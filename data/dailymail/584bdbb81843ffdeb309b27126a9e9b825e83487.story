Justine Miliband has promised to take to the ‘barricades’ in the general election battle as she vowed not to just stand silently next to husband Ed in a nice dress.

Party strategists plan to put Mrs Miliband on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election.

But she has vowed to break with convention and speak out publicly about why she thinks Mr Miliband should be Prime Minister.

The child actress-turned-barrister has begun making a public appearances and speeches at the Labour party conference to ‘humanise’ her husband.

Mr Miliband repeatedly said he would not copy David Cameron’s habit of eye-catching photo opportunities while opposition leader, and would instead focus on policies.

But the party conference in Brighton has seen a string of family photo opportunities, walking through the city centre and strolling on the beach with sons Daniel, four and Samuel, two.

The decision to use Mrs Miliband into the political fray has drawn comparisons with failed attempts by Gordon Brown and Iain Duncan Smith to use their other halves to rescue their leadership.

But she signalled that she will do more than wear a stylish dress for the traditional posed snaps at the end of the leader’s speech.

Speaking at a Young Labour event in Brighton, she said: ‘I wanted to come along to say a few words because I thought, “If I don't say anything to you guys tonight probably all you'll know about me this year is the make of the dress I wear for Ed's speech on Tuesday”.

‘That's a side of me the media tend to focus on and I thought it was quite important to reassure you that I am in fact more than a dress.’

The couple met in 2005 and got married in 2011. They have two sons. The environmental lawyer revealed the moment she realised she had fallen for Mr Miliband – while rearranging chairs in a hall in Doncaster.

She told delegates: ‘In May 2005, Ed was the prospective parliamentary candidate for Doncaster North. I was his friend.

‘So I went to Doncaster to help him campaign and I was moving chairs around in a hall getting ready for a campaign meeting and I became aware there were three long-standing party members watching me.

‘After a while one of them said to me who was I, so I explained that I was a friend of Ed's and I had come from London to help him campaign.

‘There was a pause and then the lady said to me, “That's a very long way to come to move chairs, are you sure you're just friends?”.

‘She was clearly very astute and realised before we did I think.’

The mother-of-two also told Young Labour members she is willing to help them in the run-up to the 2015 general election before joking: ‘After all you now know I can door-knock, I can move chairs although I guess falling in love at the same time probably gave it a bit of a different dimension. Nonetheless I am ready and willing.’

In 2010, Mr Miliband emerged victorious in the election for Labour Party leader ahead of his brother David.

Mrs
Miliband said she supported her husband's decision to become leader, 
adding of the last three years: ‘I'll be honest, I didn't know the half 
of what was to come.’

She explained she understood the reasons why he wanted to hold the position after visiting a working men's club in Plymouth for a question-and-answer session.

Mrs Miliband said: ‘As I listened to Ed's answers I realised firstly he knew and understood about the lives of the people in that room and secondly that he cared about creating a society that wouldn't feel like it felt to me that day, which was the people there and the bankers and the lawyers around me in London were living in two separate countries.

‘That was it for me. That was the day when I understood why Ed had decided to stand to be leader of the Labour Party, difficult a decision though that was for many reasons, and it was the day when psychologically the day I threw my lot in with Ed and the Labour Party.

‘So, there it is, that's why I'll be on the barricades in 2015 wearing whatever dress the media deem necessary to get us through.’

A Labour party source said this was just the first stage of what will be an increasing effort to raise the profile of the leader’s wife. ‘She is a huge asset to Ed, she is a huge asset to the Labour but she is her own person. She is a career woman with two young children.'

‘She comes across better than him, frankly,’ said another source.

The country doesn't need ANYTHING to do with a Milliband, Mr or Mrs.  Go away.

Woman, you are nothing.  You have not been elected and never will be.  Therefore, keep your nose out of British politics.

I have lived through many prime ministers and seen governments both Labour and.Tory come and go. Over the last twenty years I have witnessed our beloved country fall to its knees by successive Labour regimes who mismanaged every aspect of government and am now living through the cuts and belt tightening we are having to go through to try and recover! My point is, at no time during all that have I ever contemplated leaving this country despite the hardships, despite all the horror of Tony Bliars war mongering. But  if Ed Milliband ends up Prime Minister after the next election, I will leave the land of my birth and not return until he s gone! I don't like him and I certainly don't trust him, if he can stab his own brother in the back, how can we trust him to look after our country. He is a liability and if Labour want to win, they need to get of  of him and Ed Balls and start being honest about how they all but destroyed this country!

I wish she would take her husband and the idiotic and immature  Ed Balls as well. Both a complete waste of space.
