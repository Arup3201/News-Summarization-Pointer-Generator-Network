A Manchester couple did not get the honeymoon suite they expected when they ended up in police cells following a punch-up at their hotel reception.

The couple still in their wedding finery had left their guests to begin married life at  the Hilton Hotel on Deansgate, Manchester when police were called shortly before 11.30pm on Saturday.

The couple were trying to book in to their honeymoon suite when an argument began at reception.

The discussion became more heated and the concierge called hotel security to calm the situation.

That only succeeded in inflaming matters and a fight broke out between security staff and the couple.

The 25-year-old groom then allegedly attacked one of the security guards, cutting his face in the process.

The bride allegedly shouted racial abuse at the Asian guards.

The groom was arrested on suspicion of a section 47 assault with his 29-year-old wife being held on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence.

They spent their wedding night in separate cells and remain in custody for questioning.

Nick Adderley, Chief Superintendent of Greater Manchester Police’s North Division has backed his officers. He said: ‘Police were asked to attend and we did so.

‘We obviously had to decide whether it was right thing to do, to arrest.

‘But it absolutely was and I support the officers who made that decision.

‘We can’t have a situation where, regardless of what ceremony they have been to, people are being allegedly assaulted and racially abused.’
