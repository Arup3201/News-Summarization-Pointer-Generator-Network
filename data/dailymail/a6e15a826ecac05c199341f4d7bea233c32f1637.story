You don’t get many of these to the pound!

The original artwork behind vintage innuendo-laden English seaside postcards is going on sale – with price tags in the thousands.

More than 100 Donald McGill originals are included in the sale and exhibition – including risqué images that once sparked an obscenity trial.

This postcard, titled 'Just arrived all merry and bright', has a price set at £2,250

Left, the card reads: 'I'm astonishing the natives here'. It's price is £2,750. On the £2,250 postcard to the right, the man remarks: 'This place gives me such an appetite I can eat anything that's put on the table here'

For £2,250, you can purchase this postcard, titled: 'Well Sir, you said that to succeed I must begin at the bottom'

When they were first produced, the postcards were considered offensive. In this one, on sale for £2,250, the woman remarks: 'The postcards down here are positively disgusting! I must send you one!'

This black and white card can be bought for only £950. It's titled: 'I'm seeing all the sights from here'

Chris Beetles, whose Mayfair gallery is selling the pictures, said: ‘McGill’s postcards are part of the cultural memory of the nation.’

McGill produced more than 12,000 designs from 1904 until his death at the age of 87 in 1962. Featuring overbearing mother-in-laws and randy newlyweds, more than 200 million cards were sold. His most popular sold more than six million and featured a bookish man asking a pretty woman: ‘Do you like Kipling?’ and her replying: ‘I don’t know, you naughty boy, I’ve never kippled!’ But McGill’s popularity took a battering in the 1950s when his cards were branded obscene and several local councils banned them.

McGill was put on trial under the Obscene Publications Act, and pleaded guilty – marking the beginning of the end of the double-entendre postcard industry. Beetles said: ‘Nowadays we regard the cards as light-hearted but they didn’t in 1954. The authorities made sure they got him before the world changed.’

The exhibition opens on Wednesday but almost a quarter of the work has already been sold. McGill himself received only three guineas per design and didn’t own the copyright. He left just £735 when he died.

The designs are being sold by the Donald McGill archive, which has decided to scale back its collection.
