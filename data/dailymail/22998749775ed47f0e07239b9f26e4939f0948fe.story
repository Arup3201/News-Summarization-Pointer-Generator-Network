Startling: Details of the alleged case were revealed in a letter to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan

A successful Christian school could face closure after failing to invite religious leaders from other faiths to speak to pupils, it has been reported.

The school is under threat of being downgraded by Ofsted inspectors for breaching new rules designed to promote ‘British values’ such as tolerance and individual liberty.

They were introduced in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal, where Birmingham schools were infiltrated by hardline Muslim groups.

The Christian Institute, which is giving legal support to the small independent school in the Home Counties, has written to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan disclosing the details of the case, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph.

The group expressed fears that there are ‘disturbing consequences’ for religious schools which are falling foul of measures intended to combat extremism.

Inspectors are understood to have warned the head that the school, which was previously rated as ‘good’, that it would be downgraded to ‘adequate’ for failing to meet standards requiring it to ‘actively promote’ harmony between different faiths because it had failed to bring in representatives from other religions.

They warned that unless the school could demonstrate how it was going to meet the new requirements, there would be a further full inspection which could, in a worst case scenario, lead to it being closed.

It was among 40 schools across the country given lightning inspections last month in the aftermath of findings that Islamists had imposed strict religious practices on Birmingham state schools.

Ofsted rules state that inspectors must ‘consider the effectiveness of safeguarding arrangements’ including ‘the approach to keeping pupils safe from the dangers of radicalisation and extremism’.

The Christian Institute – which is planning a legal challenge to the consultation, arguing that it was rushed through – fears the new guidelines could be used to clamp down on the teaching of anything deemed politically incorrect on issues such as marriage.

Simon Calvert, deputy director of the Institute, reportedly told Mrs Morgan: ‘Worryingly, evidence is already emerging of how the new regulations are requiring Ofsted inspection teams to behave in ways which do not respect the religious ethos of faith schools.

‘The new requirements are infringing the rights of children, parents, teachers and schools to hold and practise their religious beliefs.’

Listing recent cases involving criticism of Anglican, Roman Catholic and Jewish schools by Ofsted, he added: ‘The Christian Institute is currently working with an independent Christian School which has been marked down by Ofsted for not promoting other faiths.

‘Astonishingly it was told it should invite representatives of other faith groups to lead assemblies and lessons, such as an imam. The wording of the regulations inevitably results in these kind of outcomes.

‘While we obviously support attempts to address the problem of radicalisation, the current regulations fail to do this.’

A Department for Education spokesman said last night: ‘The Independent School Standards are designed to ensure every school prepares children for life in modern Britain. We make no apology for demanding high standards and the promotion of tolerance and respect of all faiths and cultures.

‘We have received a letter from the Christian Institute’s legal representatives and are considering our response.’
