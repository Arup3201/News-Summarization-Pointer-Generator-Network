Decorating a Christmas tree is a tradition most of us associate with glitter, jolly Santa figures and shining baubles – unless, of course, you happen to be Norwegian.

The country’s US Embassy has adorned their tree in honour of Edvard Munch’s ‘The Scream’.

Their annual Christmas tree at Washington’s Union Station features hundreds of the wailing man from Norway’s most famous painting.

Tradition: An ornament honoring the 150th anniversary of the birth of Edvard Munch awaits hanging as part of the annual Christmas tree installed by the Royal Norwegian Embassy at Union Station in Washington

The
 annual Christmas tree decorated with Norwegian flags ornaments at Union
 Station is a gift from the people of Norway to the American population 
as thanks for the US's assistance during and after World War II.

The embassy has been responsible for decorating the tree for the 16th year in a row.

The unusual ornaments have been commissioned especially to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Norwegian artist.

Each year the tree follows a theme and this year Norway celebrates one of its most famous sons.

More than 700 ornaments hang on the tree branches, each of them a tiny ‘screaming man’ reflector, making the Christmas tree shine even brighter as they echo the lights of the station.

‘In a way, it symbolizes all the angst in preparing for an excellent Christmas,’ Ambassador Kåre Aas told the Washington Post.

‘I, myself, have that feeling. I’m not the only one who wants to scream from time to time.’

‘Munch's
 been celebrated throughout the year worldwide,’ Aas said. ‘It’s a 
reflection of Oslo’s increased influence as a cultural capital in Europe
 for contemporary art.’

In honour: More than 700 Edvard Munch ornaments have been made for the annual Christmas tree for the Royal Norwegian Embassy
