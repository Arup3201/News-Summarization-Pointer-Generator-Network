Standard Liege say they will hold talks with fans after a banner was unfurled depicting the decapitated head of their former captain Steven Defour.

Liege faced Anderlecht in a fierce derby on Sunday, with Defour lining up for Anderlecht having previously captained Liege in a four-year spell at the club.

Fans of Liege, outraged at the actions of their former player, showed the banner pre-match but a spokesman for the club has condemned their actions.

'During the pre-match show the fans had another banner,' Olivier Smeets told www.sport.be. 

'There is such a thing as freedom of speech but we disagree with what we saw on Sunday afternoon. After all, we understand all too well that it is offensive to many people. So we will take away the banner that was shown. 

'First, we want to have talks with the people who made this, but that does not mean no sanctions will follow.' 

The club are likely to receive a hefty fine for their fans' actions, too. 

Alongside Defour's decapitated head were the words, 'Red or Dead'. The midfielder was, of course, red during his time at Liege, but left for Porto in 2011.

He spent two years in Portugal before heading back to Belgium, but not back to Liege, to the dismay of supporters. He joined bitter rivals Anderlecht, an act of betrayal in the eyes of Liege's staunch fans.  

If their banner's sole aim was to rile Defour, they got their wish. Liege won the game 2-0, and their former captain did not last the 90 minutes.

With 53 minutes on the clock, Defour reacted to an offside call he didn't agree with, smashing the ball with pace into the Liege supporters. The referee had had enough, and a second yellow was brandished.

Everton striker Romelu Lukaku, himself a former Anderlecht player, described the game as 'Belgium's El Clasico' on Twitter. But for Defour, it is one he'll hope can be quickly erased from the memory. 

The player did show remorse after the game, taking to Twitter to express his forgiveness. 

'I apologise to my team-mates and fans at Anderlecht, although I do not understand the red card. You cannot see or hear the referee.'
