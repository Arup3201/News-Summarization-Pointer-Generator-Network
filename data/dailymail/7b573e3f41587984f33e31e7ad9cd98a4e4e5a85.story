The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have appeared in public together for the first time since Prince Phillip was admitted to hospital for an operation in June.

The royal couple were pictured being driven from Balmoral Castle to the nearby Crathie Kirk for Sunday morning prayers accompanied by the Earl and Countess of Wessex.

Although the Queen and her husband were driven straight past waiting photographers, the pair could be seen sharing the back seat of a maroon Bentley.

Worship: The royal couple routinely attend services at Crathie Kirk while staying at Balmoral

The Queen, impeccably dressed as always, wore an elegant cream suit shot through with gold thread, teamed with a classic woven natural straw hat.

Her husband, meanwhile, was dapper in a neat herringbone tweed suit paired with a patriotic tartan tie.

The royal couple are currently enjoying their annual holiday in Scotland and have been joined by a succession of family members.

Although the Earl and Countess of Wessex are currently in residence, last week brought a visit from Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, who shocked royal watchers by arriving with his former wife, Sarah Ferguson.

Royal connection: All British monarchs since Queen Victoria have used Crathie Kirk while at Balmoral

Holiday: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are currently enjoying a holiday on the 50,000 acre estate

Family: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were joined by the Earl and Countess of Wessex at church

The divorced couple flew to Aberdeen airport and were driven to the 50,000 acre estate with their daughters, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice.

Prince Charles and his wife Camilla are expected to make the trip north before the month and it has been reported that accompanying them will be the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son, Prince George.

The birth of Prince George means that for the first time in more than a century, there are three direct heirs to the throne.

Like his father, grandfather and great grandmother, Prince George is likely to be taken to a service at Crathie Kirk, which has been used by royal worshippers since 1848.

Queen Victoria was the first royal to use the tiny church and all subsequent monarchs have followed suit.
