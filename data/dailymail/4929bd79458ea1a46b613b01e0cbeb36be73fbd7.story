England’s Young Lions started the UEFA Development Tournament with a disappointing defeat as Switzerland fought back from two goals down to win at St George’s Park.

Steve Cooper’s charges were playing the first of three matches at the national team’s Staffordshire HQ this week with Slovakia and France still to come.

And despite Chelsea’s Martell Taylor-Crossdale and Newcastle United’s Mackenzie Heaney putting them into a very strong position, Swiss superiority ultimately told.

The under 16s represent the bottom rung of the England development ladder and for many of these schoolboys it was a proud moment as they pulled on the Three Lions jersey for the first time.

And it didn’t take long for them to click as Taylor-Crossdale produced an emphatic close range finish to give them a fourth-minute lead.

Although England were ahead, it quickly became apparent that Switzerland were an accomplished passing outfit and they tested home goalkeeper Taye Hammond-Ashby of Fulham on several occasions in the first-half.

But against the run of play, England doubled their lead when Heaney curled in a splendid far corner effort that goalkeeper Lars Hunn couldn’t get a glove to.

As half-time approached, the hosts were unable to hang on any longer and Switzerland hit them with a double blow. 

First, Cendrim Kameraj halved the deficit with a header before Andi Zeqiri levelled with a firm low strike.

The interval allowed England a chance to catch their breath but they were behind moments after the restart when Kameraj doubled his personal tally following a well-worked team move.

Cooper’s men did their best to find a route back into the contest and came close when Keanen Bennetts, the Arsenal man, struck the post from close range.

England are next in action at St George’s Park against Slovakia on Wednesday afternoon.
