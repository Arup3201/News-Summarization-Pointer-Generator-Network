There are only enough honeybees in Britain to properly pollinate a quarter of the country’s crops, scientists claim.

Destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees, which are vital for food production.

Professor Simon Potts of the University of Reading, who led the research project, said: ‘We face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now.’

The research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that Europe has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops.

Bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides.

Previous studies have estimated that the number of British honeybees have halved over the last 25 years.

Scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination.

Professor Potts added: ‘Wild pollinators need greater protection.

Research by the University of Reading found that Europe has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops. The maps show the capacity of national honeybee colonies to supply demand for pollination services, in 2005 (e) and 2010 (f)

‘They are the unsung heroes of the countryside, providing a critical link in the food chain for humans and doing work for free that would otherwise cost British farmers £1.8billion to replace.’

Overall, the 41 European countries studied have only two-thirds of the honeybees they need.

But the problem is particularly acute in Britain, where there are only 275,000 colonies – a quarter of the one million colonies needed to maximise yields. A bee colony can vary in size from 20,000 to 60,000 bees.

Professor Potts said the demand for insect 
pollinators is increasing as demand grows, particularly for oil crops 
such as oilseed rape and sunflowers.

He
 said:‘Farmers are encouraged to grow oil crops, yet there is not 
enough joined-up thinking about how to help the insects that will 
pollinate them.

‘We need
 a proper strategy across Europe to conserve wild bees and pollinators 
through habitat protection, agricultural policy and farming methods – or
 we risk big financial losses to the farming sector and a potential food
 security crisis.’

Dr 
Tom Breeze, who conducted the research, said insect pollinators add 
£37million a year to the value in increased yields of just two varieties
 of British apples.
