As the parents of two young boys, Laurence Fox and Billie Piper appear to be living a life of domestic bliss.

But the Lewis star has revealed one serious bone of contention between him and his famous wife – their children’s education.

Despite attending a top private school himself, the actor says he would like Winston, 5, and Eugene, 18 months, to go to a state school.

But his wife Billie, whose education at the Sylvia Young theatre school was cut short when she became a pop star at the age of 15, has taken a different view.

The 31-year-old singer and actress thinks the quality of the school should be the most important factor in their decision-making process.

Explaining his aversion to private education, Fox – whose family acting dynasty includes James Fox, Edward Fox and his cousin Silent Witness star Emilia Fox – said: ‘I think if you want to opt out of the state system that’s you saying you’re a better class of person.’

The 35-year-old has spoken of the miserable years he spent at the elite Harrow School before he was expelled after an ‘indiscretion’ with a girl.

And he said he feared that whatever school his boys attend, they could face ‘50 times’ more bullying than even he experienced thanks to the fact that ‘their mum’s Billie Piper and their dad is me’.
