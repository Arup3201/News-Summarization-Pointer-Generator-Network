A motion-tracking device that can 'see' through walls without using a camera could change the face of video gaming.

Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed the 3D motion tracker which uses radio waves to mark a person's location.

The device can plot moves and even follow gestures, meaning that a person can switch a light off in a separate room just by raising their arm.

Ground breaking: WiTrack can track movements and gestures, such as pointing at a lamp to switch it on, though walls without using cameras or wearable technology

Using radio signals about 1,000 times less powerful than a smartphone, the WiTrack bounces off objects detected through a wall to pinpoint a person with 97 per cent accuracy.

WiTrack relies on four antennae to plot movements. One sends radio waves and three receive them. An algorithm is then used to sift through readings caused by waves hitting household objects such as sofas.

Fadel Adib, one of the researchers behind it, told Extreme Tech that the transmitted waves were  'structured in a particular way to measure the time from when the signal was transmitted until the reflections come back'.

The designers behind WiTrack envision it being used for video games and to control household appliances.

With video game user, players would no longer have to remain in front of the computer, and could stalk enemies in hallways and launch ambushes from behind the sofa. 

It could also be used to help monitor elderly people who are at risk of falling, without an individual having to wear an alarm or put cameras inside their home.

While it will be years before the device is ready for commercial release, it is already making its mark as being cheaper than other devices and also does away with the need of cameras and other wearable technology.
