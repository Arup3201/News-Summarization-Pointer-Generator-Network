The controversial 'hands up, don't shoot' protest by St Louis Rams players has been praised by an organisation representing the city's black police officers, it has been revealed.

Five players made the gesture at Missouri's Edward Jones Dome on Sunday following the decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson over the death of unarmed teen Michael Brown.

Their actions, in a game against the Oakland Raiders, were branded 'tasteless, offensive and inflammatory' by the St Louis Police Officers Association, which demanded a 'very public apology' from the team.

But today it has been revealed that their view was not necessarily shared by all of the city's law-enforcement community.

The Ethical Society of Police, which describes itself as the 'primary voice of African-American police officers in St Louis', does not have a problem with the gesture.

A statement posted on its Facebook page, said it 'completely supports the actions of the St. Louis Rams football players in which they showed support for the family of Michael Brown by entering the stadium with their hands up.'

'We think that their actions were commendable and that they should not be ridiculed, disciplined or punished for taking a stand on this very important issue which is of great concern around the world and especially in the community where these players work.'

CNN reports that the group has about 220 members from the St. Louis police force and that St Louis Police Offices Association has yet to respond to requests for comment.

The NFL players who made the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture in solidarity with Ferguson protesters will not be fined nor disciplined for their actions, it has been reported.

The five St Louis Rams footballers performed the now-famous sign on the field before the team's game against the Oakland Raiders at Missouri's Edward Jones Dome on Sunday. 

Following the gesture, officials from the St Louis County Police Association - the police union for the area including riot-stricken Ferguson - demanded that the players be punished by their superiors. 

The team later denied claims that it had issued an apology to the organisation. 

It has since been revealed that the NFL will not take disciplinary action against the players: wide receivers Stedman Bailey,Tavon Austin, Chris Givens and Kenny Britt, and tight end, Jared Cook.  

The 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture was a reference to witness accounts of Ferguson officer Darren Wilson's fatal shooting of Michael Brown,on August 9. 

Some protesters claim the unarmed black 18-year-old was raising his hands in surrender when he was shot 12 times by Wilson. However, the accounts have been disputed.

It comes as people have been taking to streets of more than 170 U.S. cities in protest against a grand jury's recent decision to not indict Mr Wilson in the fatal shooting.

After making the gesture on Sunday, wide receiver Bailey said he and his teammates decided to raise their hands in the air shortly before the game, and intended it to be something positive.  

A Rams spokesman said on Sunday that the team was not aware the gesture had been planned before the game against the Oakland Raiders.

On Sunday, wide receivers Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt came out together first, with the move obscured by a smoke machine in the upper reaches of the stadium.

Stedman Bailey, Jared Cook and Chris Givens - all of whom are black - then came out and stood together with arms raised.

After Tre Mason scored on an 8-yard run to make it 45-0 in the fourth quarter, the gesture made another appearance when he and Britt raised their hands together.

Rams won the game with a final score of 52-0.
