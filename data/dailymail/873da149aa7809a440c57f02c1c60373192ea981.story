Three-year-old Alfie Williams was left profoundly deaf after a viral infection

A three-year-old boy who lost his hearing as a result of a mystery virus has become a social media star.

Alfie Williams, from Medomsley, County Durham, was plagued by an illness which left him profoundly deaf.

Devastated, his mother Danielle set about trying to raise awareness for the National Deaf Children's Society.

Her #handsonears Twitter campaign has now gone viral - and attracted support from many famous names.

Celebrities such as DJ Fatboy Slim aka Norman Cook and his wife Zoe Ball, Man Vs Food's Adam Richman, sprinter Iwan Thomas and TV presenter Andi Peters have all tweeted pictures with their hands over their ears.

Mrs Williams, 33, a full-time mother, said: 'When the doctors told me about Alfie, I cried for about two months.'

'Alfie loved
 music, especially the Beatles song Hey Jude, and we were 
distraught when we realised he would never be able to hear it again.

'Then one day my husband John and I decided we had to turn it into something positive, so we started the Hands on Ears campaign.

'I put the photo of the family on Facebook and it just kind of took off - I never expected it to be this big.

'We've worked really hard, and Alfie's brothers and sister have been great, I've been blown away the support.

'Alfie is too young to understand the social media storm
 he has triggered, but I'm putting together a montage of all the photos 
to show him when he grows up.'

Devastated but determined to make the best of things, Alfie's family started the Hands on Ears campaign to raise awareness of deafness.

Alfie, who has a twin brother called George, started suffering symptoms of the virus in March 2012.

His mother said: 'Normally he gets up straight away, but that morning he wouldn't. He was sick and I thought he was just feeling under the weather.

'But a few days later he wasn't getting any better, so we took him to the doctors where we were given antibiotics.

'But these didn't help either. He wasn't eating and his balance was off.'

Despite numerous visits to the doctor, Alfie's condition was dismissed as an ear infection.

But in November 2012, Mrs Williams realised Alfie wasn't responding to sounds.Â 

She said: 'When we shouted his name he wouldn't react.

'Then when doctors did the sound test they told us was profoundly deaf.

'He was fitted with grommets and I hoped they would work, but at the follow-up test he still couldn't hear a thing. I was devastated and couldn't stop crying.'

It is still not clear what caused Alfie's illness, but one theory is it may have been meningitis.

Mike Wade, from the National Deaf Children's Society, said: 'We are extremely grateful to Danielle for raising awareness of childhood deafness.

'There are 45,000 deaf children and young people in the UK, and they are often vulnerable to isolation, abuse, bullying and poor self-esteem.

'That's why campaigns like Danielle's, that get people thinking and talking about deafness, are so important.

'She has done a fantastic job of raising awareness so far and we wish her every success.'
