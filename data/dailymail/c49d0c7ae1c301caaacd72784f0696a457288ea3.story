Roger Federer put on a show for his fellow sporting superstars as he eased into the second week of Wimbledon without dropping a set.

Colombian Santiago Giraldo was Federer's latest victim, the seven-time champion winning their third-round contest 6-3 6-1 6-3 in an hour and 21 minutes.

David Beckham, Sachin Tendulkar and Sir Bobby Charlton stayed into the evening in the Royal Box to watch the grass-court master at work, and he did not disappoint.

Federer's backhand did the damage at the start as the fourth seed moved into a 3-0 lead, and he was untroubled through the rest of the opening set.

Giraldo, who was looking to become the first Colombian to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon, needed a good start to the second set but played a woeful service game.

Federer, who had called on umpires to tackle time wasting, breezed into a 4-0 lead and nothing was going right for his opponent.

Serving to stay in the set, he thought he had served an ace only to be pulled up for a foot fault, and Giraldo then drove a forehand long to hand it to Federer.

The only moment when Giraldo threatened to get back into the match came in the seventh game of the third set, but Federer saved two break points with big serving.

In the next game he broke serve when Giraldo netted a forehand and Federer clinched the final game to love to set up a clash with either Tommy Robredo or Jerzy Janowicz.

Federer was more than happy with his victory, saying: 'I got off to a good start and stayed in control until midway through the third set when he had a couple of break points.

'Next thing I had break points, I got it done and served it out. I'm very happy. It was a really good match.'

Federer joined Andy Murray in reaching round four without dropping a set, and he said: 'I'm very pleased.

'It's always good to keep moving on. I'm aware of the dangers on this surface. You're always worried about the first week.

'For me it's about maintaining a good level. I've got a few niggling things going on but nothing that worries me. I need to keep playing aggressive.'
