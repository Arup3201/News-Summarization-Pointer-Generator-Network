A blind woman is taking court action against supermarket giant Coles for discrimination because it takes her days to complete a shopping order on their online store.

Gisele Mesnage, who is legally blind, wants Coles to make its website more user friendly for people who have a visual impairment.

The supermarket giant said it had made 'significant investments' to ensure everyone's shopping experience on its site, including those who are blind.

Blind woman Gisele Mesnage, from Sydney, has taken legal action against Coles for discrimination

But Ms Mesnage, from Sydney, said legal action had been a last resort for her as she had repeatedly asked Coles to fix the problem.

To use her computer, she uses a special screen-reader to access the internet and has had issues with using the supermarket's online store to do her shopping since 2008.

The screen-reader offers Ms Mesnage quick navigation, audio feedback and quick responsiveness.

But Coles' website failed to have the capability to allow her to shop efficiently.

When she hovers over items on the site she is not told any information but receives generic error messages.

'When selecting a delivery time, I'm just hearing "blank",' Ms Mesnage told reporters on Thursday.

'When I tap my keyboard I have to wait 30 seconds, 40 seconds before the website responds.'

In an online statement, Ms Mesnage added she just wanted to be treated like every other shopper.

'I'm sick of being shut out or spending literally days completing just one order,' she said.

'Although Coles has tried to fix problems with the site over the years, the site is not consistently accessible.

'Each time the site is upgraded, accessibility issues recur, or new ones arise.' 

The firm who are representing Ms Mesnage in this case is the Public Interest Advocacy and her lawyer is senior solicitor Michelle Cohen. 

'Online grocery shopping should allow people who are blind to do their supermarket shopping independently,' Ms Cohen said.

'It is very disappointing that a large supermarket chain like Coles has not made accessibility a high priority.

'It's not acceptable for people in a wheelchair to be prevented from using a physical supermarket, so why should people with vision impairment be treated as second-class citizens?'

A Coles spokesman said the supermarket sought to provide 'outstanding service' to all its customers 

Ms Mesnage has filed two complaints with the Human Rights Commission since the issues arose in 2008

A Coles spokesman said the supermarket sought to provide 'outstanding service' to all its customers.

'Coles has made a significant investment to provide a great online shopping experience for all of our customers, including many who are vision impaired or have other disabilities,' he said.

'Coles recognises and endorses the importance of online accessibility, and we are continually working to improve our online grocery shop, including improvements to the accessibility of the website. 

'We work with experts in this field to make our site usable by people with disabilities.

'Coles is reviewing the documents lodged with the court and will respond in due course.'
