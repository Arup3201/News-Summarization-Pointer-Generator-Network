The 29-year-old terminal cancer sufferer who plans to take her life on November 1 has ticked visiting the Grand Canyon off her bucket list.

Newlywed Brittany Maynard, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor less than a year ago, said in a video announcing her decision last month that she hoped to see the Grand Canyon before she died.

On Friday, she revealed on her website that she had managed to travel from her home in Oregon to Arizona with her husband, mother and stepfather 'thanks to the kindness of Americans around the country who came forward to make my "bucket list" dream come true'.

'The Canyon was breathtakingly beautiful, and I was able to enjoy my time with the two things I love most: my family and nature,' she wrote. 

Images taken at the Canyon show her kissing her husband, Dan, and embracing her mother and stepfather, grins across their faces.

But just a day after the experience, she suffered her 'worst seizure thus far', which left her temporarily paralyzed and tired for the rest of the day.

'The seizure was a harsh reminder that my symptoms continue to worsen as the tumor runs its course,' she wrote.

Campaign: Maynard is pictured in a still from a video she released last month explaining why she wanted to take her life and calling for more states to implement a 'Death with Dignity Act', like Oregon

She finished the post by saying she found meaning in her battle for other states to implement right-to-die laws, as Oregon and four other state already have. 

'My dream is that every terminally ill American has access to the choice to die on their own terms with dignity,' she wrote. 'Please take an active role to make this a reality.'

Maynard gained nationwide attention after she shared a heart-wrenching video that explained  why she was choosing to end her life at age 29 - while campaigning to expand right-to-die laws.

Debilitating: A scan shows the Glioblastoma multiforme that would claim her life slowly within 14 months

She explained that, after suffering intense headaches, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor in January and was initially given 10 years to live, which she said was devastating.

But in a scan a few months later, doctors told her the cancer had progressed to Glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive tumor. 

Sufferers have a life expectancy of around 14 months.

Brittany Maynard launched an online video campaign for Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life non-profit organization, to promote death-with-dignity laws, which currently exist in only five states. 

Washington, Oregon, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico  allow people to die on their own terms, but Maynard says it is not enough.

‘Right now it's a choice that's only available to some Americans, which is really unethical,’ she said. 

Working through her foundation, The Brittany Fund, Maynard wants other states, like California, New Jersey and Colorado, to consider passing laws that would allow people to make the ultimate choice - life or death.

Since Oregon lawmakers passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1997, more than 1,170 people have obtained prescriptions under the law, and fewer than half of them used them to end their lives. 

When she learned that she would die painfully and slowly, she decided to move from her home in California to Oregon, which has a 'Death with Dignity Act'.

She qualified for the medication, which she already has. 

She plans to take it on November 1 because she wants to celebrate her husband's birthday, which falls on October 30, for the last time. 

She hopes to be surrounded by her husband, mother, stepfather and best friend.  

After releasing her video, critics lambasted her as selfish, but in an interview with CBS she said she was suffered immense pain - and wished she didn't have to be making the decision. 

Maynard said her biggest regret is that she will never get to have a family.

'I'd say most of my sadness centers around how much I wanted a family,' Maynard told CBS This Morning.

'And it feels like for me, that was always, like, how you created a legacy was, like, through your children. And sort of inadvertently -- through sharing my story, I've realized there's a bit of the legacy I'm creating this way and I'm not ashamed of that. I'm not ashamed to attach my name to what I think is a right that should belong to all terminally ill Americans.'

Time cut short: She is pictured with her husband, Dan. He said he is devastated he cannot spend the rest of his life with her, but understands she wants quality of life over quantity

'I don't want to die,' Maynard explained. 'If anyone wants to hand me, like, a magical cure and save my life so that I can have children with my husband, you know, I will take them up on it.' 

She also has made a deal with her mother, Debbie, that if she travels to Machu Pichu in Peru after her passing, Brittany’s spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins. 

In the same interview, Debbie, who raised Maynard on her own, talks about the discussion she had about her daughter when she learned of her decision.

'Early on, I told her, "It would be my honor to take care of you, whichever way; if you need to be fed or diapered, it would be my honor,"' she said.

'And that was important for me, for her to know.' 

Maynard's husband, Dan Diaz, also spoke about how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married little over a year ago.

'That was the original plan, right?' he said. 'But the reality that, I guess, that feeds into the argument of quality of life versus just quantity.'
