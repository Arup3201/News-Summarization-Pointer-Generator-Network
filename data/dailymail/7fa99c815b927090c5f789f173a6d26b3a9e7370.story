This mechanical monster is the world's fastest v-twin motorcycle.

And if you're the kind of person who likes to take risks on two wheels - and you've got a spare £45,000 - then you can get your hands on one.

For the Confederate X132 Hellcat Combat motorcycle is finally going into limited production, after it this summer broke the land speed record for big block v-twins.

Available to buy: James Hoegh with the X132 Hellcat Combat motorcycle, on which he broke the land speed record for big block v-twin motorbikes in Utah this summer after riding it to 172.2 mph

Face melting speed: Despite an ultra-light weight of just 490lbs, the monster 2,000cc bike pumps out 160 brake-horsepower which helps it to reach incredible speeds

James Hoegh set the record, clocking a face-melting 172.2 mph at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah - the equivalent of 200 miles per hour on tarmac.

Confederate founder Matthew Chambers, described the new Hellcat by saying, 'This is the motorcycle we were conceived to execute when I founded the company 21 years ago.

'I have every confidence that we have delivered all we ever dreamed of giving.'

Rip up the commute: Confederate are offering a limited run of just 36 of the handcrafted motorbikes for sale, which are a modification of their standard Hellcat model

All American: Confederate products are U.S.- made, and they claim each part is made to the highest standard

Personalised: Each bespoke model of the X123 Hellcat Combat shipped will be ergonomically tailored for the buyer, down to including their name printed on the fuel tank. This bike is marked for test rider James Heogh

The monster 2,000cc bike pumps out 160 brake-horsepower which, combined with the ultra-light total weight of just 490lbs, help this mechanical marvel reach incredible speeds.

Named after the legendary F6F Hellcat fighter plane of WWII, the X132 Hellcat is the result of an uncompromising design and manufacturing approach.

The centrepiece of Confederate's approach is the Hellcat's billet aluminum case. Instead of the usual casting method, the Hellcat's case is machined from two blocks of billet 6061 aircraft grade aluminum.

The company says:  'This new case unites America's best V-Twin technology and America's superior powertrain technology into a singularity. 

'Although this material selection and craft methodology is expensive, it is simply the best approach for maximising strength and guaranteeing permanence.'

The standard model: The Combat bike is a modification of Confederate's regular X132 Hellcat, pictured

Precision engineered: Each component of the Hellcat shows evidence of attention to detail

'Heirloom product': The basic model retails for a cool $50,000

The core: The Hellcat's ngine, transmission, swingarm pivot and frame mounts into singular core that is carved from a single piece of aluminium

Clay Morrison, director of marketing, added: 'Because we design and craft each Confederate motorcycle to be a multi-generational heirloom product, we require that each component, from the carbon-fibre wheels to the smallest stainless steel bolts, be of the highest quality, no matter the cost.

'Our clients deserve nothing less.'
