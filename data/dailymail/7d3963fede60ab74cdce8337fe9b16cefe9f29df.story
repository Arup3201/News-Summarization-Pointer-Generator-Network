Veteran actress Sheila Hancock, 81,  has confessed she has started shopping around for an old people's home

SHE is as busy as ever and at 81 has no intention of putting her feet up.

But Sheila Hancock is only too aware that time is not on her side and has confessed she has started shopping around for an old people's home.

The veteran actress who last year starred in a musical and penned a novel, said if she develops dementia she would like to be cared for in a home. Discussing her age and the years that have gone by, she said: 'I have got to that age where I have got to think that I have only got a few years left. When you are past 80 you know you have about five years of active life or 10 years at the very most.

'You have to think seriously what you are going to do. I am not going to do any more long runs in shows. I want to be at home and do my own thing occasionally.

'I still like a drink but it is mainly on my own. You do begin to feel old when your daughter is 50 and my oldest grandchild is going to be 20. That is when you know you are getting near the end.'

She then added: 'I am inspecting old people's homes. That is my latest mission. I don't want to be put into a nasty one so I am looking at all the old people's homes in the district saying 'I am not going to that one. I may go to that one. If I go senile I want to go to that one'.

Miss Hancock made her comments during her appearance on ITV's Jonathan Ross show which will be shown on Saturday evening.

Care of the dying is a matter close to her heart – she has opened two dementia wards, one run by Quakers in a psychiatric hospital in York and another in Portsmouth.

She has also said in the past: 'I feel strongly that terminal care should be mandatory for every nurse and doctor. People are still dying badly.'

Miss Hancock, whose 60-year career encompassed TV, film and theatre, last year starred in musical Barking in Essex and ensures that she stays in shape by doing yoga, pilates and swimming and walking everywhere.

She told host Ross that these days she is not short of offers to work but finds most of the parts marked for her are either for characters who 'either get senile or die now or get shot.'

And she revealed she once suffered from terrible stage fright when she was in Sweeney Todd and tried everything from hypnotherapy to drugs to cure it. She said: 'It is absolute terror. I get scared. When you are an actor you are afraid that you are going to forget your lines. I lost my nerve totally and then I went to a hypnotist and I used hypnotherapy. I have used it for giving up smoking and fear of flying. It works for me.'

Asked if she had ever taken medication for her anxiety she added: 'I took pills like mad...uppers and downers but they did not work.'

Miss Hannock made the revelation on ITV's Jonathan Ross show, which airs tomorrow

Miss Hancock was married to actor John Thaw, best known for his starring roles in The Sweeney and Inspector Morse. He died of oesophageal cancer in February 2002, aged 60. Miss Hancock has admitted in the past that Thaw was a depressive and alcoholic and as such it turned their marriage into a tempestuous one.

And it appears she has no desire to find a replacement for Thaw – describing a date she was encouraged to go on by her friends, she said: 'I went out with this old guy. He asked me out. All my friends said 'Go on, make an effort'. I started doing the thing of being lovely and hopefully attractive and suddenly half way through I found myself thinking 'Have I put on the electric blanket?'

'I knew. I thought I have got to the age now where I am more interested in my electric blanket than some boring old git.'

The mother of two told Ross she had developed a penchant for pop music and now has a fondness for Adele, Lily Allen and Noel Gallagher.

But while she may be willing to embrace modern music, the modern face of Labour does not move her.

Becoming the latest celebrity to express discontent with Ed Miliband's party she told Ross: 'I am a member of the party but I am a bit ambivalent at the moment. I could not vote for anybody else but I am a bit worried at the moment. We have got to vote whatever.'
