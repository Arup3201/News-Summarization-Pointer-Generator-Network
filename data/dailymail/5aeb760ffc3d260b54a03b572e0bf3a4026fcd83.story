A multi-millionaire investment tycoon and space travel enthusiast is said to be planning a privately funded trip to Mars.

Dennis Tito, who became the first paying passenger to visit the International Space Station in 2001, is understood to be plotting a 501-day mission to the red planet in 2018 - by which time he will be 77 years old.

Details of the American entrepreneur's plan for a Mars flyby emerged ahead of a news conference due to take place in Washington next week.

The plans came to light in a media advisory notice published on the SpaceRef website this week.

Attributed to the Texas-based Griffins Communications Group, the advisory contained details of a 'Mission for America' capitalising on an opportunity to launch a round-trip mission to Mars in January 2018.

An NBC News report said the notice also included details of a news conference due to take place in Washington at the end of this month, organised by the Inspiration Mars Foundation.

The foundation is described as 'a newly founded non-profit organisation led by American space traveller and entrepreneur Dennis Tito'.

Mr Tito, a former rocket engineer, founded Santa Monica based Wilshire Associates, a multi-billion dollar investment firm.

He made history as the world's first 
space tourist in 2001 when he paid a reported $20million for an eight 
day round trip to the International Space Station on board Russia's 
Soyuz TM-32 spacecraft.

The trip was highly controversial at the time, but six other tycoons have gone on to take similar trips in the years since.

Mr Tito's newly-fledged Inspiration Mars Foundation is 'committed to accelerating America's human exploration of space as a critical catalyst for future growth, national prosperity, new knowledge and global leadership,' according to the media advisory.

Jonathan Clark, a former NASA flights surgeon who now acts as an advisor on space ventures, is also due to make an appearance at the press conference on February 27.

Mr Tito is also due to give a presentation at the IEEE Aerospace Conference in Montana next month, the NBC News report said.

His mission is expected to involve a flyby of Mars, without stopping, followed by a return to earth.

According to an advance copy of Mr Tito's presentation seen by spaceflight consultant Jeff Foust of the NewSpace Journal, the special set of orbital circumstances required to create that kind of low-energy trajectory are expected to come about in 2018, but will not be repeated until 2031.
