An outraged father is suing a child psychologist after she dubbed him an unfit parent because he refused to take his five-year-old son to McDonald's.

David Evan Schorr, 43, an attorney from the Upper East Side, says in a civil lawsuit that he planned to take his son Max to their 'usual restaurant' on a recent custody visit but the child demanded to go to McDonald's and 'threw a tantrum' when he said no.

The father drew the line at the unhealthy burger joint because he felt Max had been eating 'too much junk food,' the court papers state, so Schorr gave the boy an ultimatum: dinner at any other restaurant, or no dinner at all.

'The child, stubborn as a mule, chose the "no dinner" option,' the suit states.

Not wanting to reward his bad behavior, Schorr stood his ground but when he dropped the hungry boy home later that night, he apparently tattled.

The child's mother, Bari Yunis Schorr, with whom Schorr is in the midst of a bitter custody battle, immediately called their court-appointed psychologist Marilyn Schiller and reported the incident, according to the suit.

The Schorrs married in a lavish ceremony at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan but just four years later, in 2011, Mrs Schorr sued her husband for a divorce.

She recently filed motions asking the judge to punish her ex for flouting court orders and for a judgment on nonpayment of child support, according to The New York Post.

After Dr Schiller heard about the McDonald's incident, she demanded Schorr submit to a forensic examination before a custody trial with his estranged wife, the suit states.

Dr Schiller allegedly only interviewed the child and his mother then told the court the father was 'wholly incapable of taking care of his son' and should be denied his weekend visitation.

The furious father says he's had partial custody of his son for two and a half years and it's always 'run smoothly without incident.'

He says in the suit that he wished 'mightily that he had agreed to McDonaldâ€™s in the first place' but believes he needed to set an example.

Schorr is now demanding the shrink return the $2,750 he paid for the evaluation he claims was a sham and based entirely on the McDonald's incident.

Dr Schiller told the New York Post she could not comment on the details of the incident, saying only: 'I am conducting a forensic evaluation on this matter. I will be issuing a confidential report to the court and the matter will be tried by the court.'

Bari Schorr's attorney, Louis I. Newman, said the litigation did not involve his client and refused to comment.

The custody trial resumes in December.
