Big Brother plans to spy on all internet visits, emails and texts will cost the taxpayer £2billion.

The extraordinary bill was revealed amid revelations that Britain’s snooping watchdog has grave doubts about the mass surveillance project.

The Office of the Information Commissioner said the case had ‘not been made’ to justify the sweeping expansion in the power of the police and other public bodies to trawl through private communications, including visits to Facebook and eBay.

Internal ICO papers, marked restricted, say the Orwellian plan could lead to the innocent being wrongly identified as criminals or terrorists and barred from flying.

Grave doubts: The mass surveillance project has sparked fears that it could lead to the innocent being wrongly identified as criminals or terrorists

A huge row has broken out at Westminster over the plans, which look certain to be included in the forthcoming Queen’s Speech.

Splits
 in the coalition over the proposals were signalled by Tim Farron, the 
Lib Dem president. He said: ‘We didn’t scrap ID cards to back creeping 
surveillance by other means. The State mustn’t be able to trace citizens
 at will.’

In opposition, both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats were fierce opponents of the policy, first suggested by Labour in 2006.

They are now pointing to the huge estimated cost of the spying project at a time when the Government is making cuts elsewhere.

The
 Home Office estimates that the programme – under which internet 
providers will be paid to store hundreds of millions of pieces of data 
for up to two years – will cost £2billion over its first decade alone.

Beyond this point there will be annual running costs of £200million – or £380 a minute.

Even these figures, which are based on
 2009 prices, could be an underestimate given the complexity of the 
project – and officials’ terrible record for estimating the price of IT 
schemes.

The data will have 
to be stored securely, in a way which makes it easy for GCHQ, the 
government listening agency, to access. This requires huge resources 
which the Government has agreed to pay.

The alternative would have seen internet service providers passing on the cost to their customers.

Downing Street insisted that only times, dates, numbers and email and internet addresses would be accessible by GCHQ.

A warrant will still be required to access the content.

Ministers say the changes are needed to keep pace with technology.  But the concerns of the Information Commissioner’s Office were uncovered by the Tory MP Dominic Raab, using freedom of information requests.

Staff prepared papers for the 
commissioner, Christopher Graham, in 2010 when it was first suggested 
that the Coalition might revive Labour’s scheme.

'This is a stark warning'

The
 documents say: ‘Our position remains that the case for the retention of
 this data still needs to be made. The value of historic communications 
data in criminal investigations has not yet been elucidated.’

Worryingly, they warn of serious consequences for the public if mistakes are made when the data is being stored.

Officials
 say: ‘Individuals may be wrongly identified, subject to identity fraud 
or there may just be a mistake. How do they put this right? Intelligence
 can be used to put people on no-fly lists, limit incomes or asset grabs
 by government agencies.

‘There needs to be a clear means of repair when something goes wrong, which it inevitably will at some point.’

The papers also warn of the potential for abuse by internet service providers, once they have been paid to collect the data.

Defence: Security minister James Brokenshire said the emphasis was on solving crime rather than 'real-time snooping on everybody's emails'

‘There
 needs to be some recognition that this additional data will be a 
honeypot as it will reveal the browsing habits and communications of 
celebrities, politicians etc.

‘Has
 a government minister been using web applications to communicate on 
Adultfriendfinder? Just how long has that celebrity being communicating 
with his alleged mistress on Skype?’

Mr
 Raab said: ‘This is a stark warning. Far from improving our security, 
these flawed plans to privatise Big Brother surveillance will subject 
every citizen to intrusive monitoring, and expose us to the risk of 
massive fraud on an unprecedented scale.’

Britain
 is already one of the most spied-upon nations – with three million 
operations carried out under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act –
 ostensibly an anti-terror law – over the last decade.

These have 
included thousands of operations by town hall bureaucrats, the Financial
 Services Authority, NHS trusts, the Environment Agency and a plethora 
of government departments.

Ministers are under pressure severely to restrict access to the new regime.

Councils
 have used their existing powers to snoop on families suspected of 
cheating school catchment area rules and putting their bins out on the 
wrong day.

Whitehall sources
 insist councils will have only very limited access to the information, 
and will require the approval of a magistrate. They will not have access
 to any sensitive data.  Security minister James Brokenshire said the 
emphasis was on solving crime rather than ‘real-time snooping on 
everybody’s emails’.

He told
 Radio 4’s The World at One: ‘We absolutely get the need for appropriate
 safeguards and for appropriate protections to be put in place around 
any changes that might come forward.

‘What
 this is not is the previous government’s plan of creating some sort of 
great big Big Brother database. That is precisely not what this is 
looking at.’

Many of us have several devices to communicate with others. Here, we explain how the new system will affect them:

Under surveillance: In future, every website visit via your iPad or laptop would be kept for a fixed period by your internet service provider

LANDLINE

No
 change. Police, the security services and other public bodies can 
already access data on who you are calling and when, but not the details
 of what was said. This information is stored by phone companies, but a 
ministerial warrant is required to access it.

MOBILE PHONE

Officials
 can already find out who you have called or texted and when, and even 
pinpoint your location. The law does not currently cover modern ways of 
communicating, such as BlackBerrys. In future, those platforms would be 
tracked too.

LAPTOP/IPAD

Some
 basic data is currently stored, such as when a person started browsing 
the web. In future, every website visit would be kept for a fixed period
 by your internet service provider. This would only detail the address 
of the website, and not the exact content.

EMAIL

No
 change. Officials can already see who you email, and when. If there is a
 suspicion of wrongdoing, police and security services can access your 
correspondence under a warrant.

SKYPE

Terrorists
 have turned to Skype, as existing laws do not cover internet telephone 
calls. Security officials say this loophole must be closed. If their 
demands are met, they would be able to check who you call and when.

FACEBOOK

As
 with web browsing, social networking data is not routinely stored. New 
rules would give the authorities the right to know who you have been 
talking to on Facebook, and when.

GAMES CONSOLE

Security
 services suspect online gaming – which allows players to chat using 
headsets or text messages – could be used to plot terrorist activity. In
 future, data would be stored on who gamers play with or talk to.
