Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie has revealed that a move to Malta in 2007 kick-started his football career and diverted his path away from becoming a carpenter.

The DR Congo international was not always plying his trade in the Premier League, instead working his way up the leagues from humble beginnings at Hillingdon Borough.

In fact, he was close to giving up before being offered the chance to play abroad; a move that saved his career.

'Simply playing professional football is a dream come true, but if I hadn't made it as a player, I would've probably gone into carpentry,' Bolasie wrote on his blog for Sportlobster. 'This is what I was set up to do, before I went to play football in Malta.

'My girlfriend's dad and I were planning on working together, but I got the move to Floriana and the rest is history. I am pretty handy, though, and would've learned a lot more.'

Handy, perhaps, is one word to describe Bolasie's talents on the pitch too... although that would be understating his ability.

The 25-year-old has been on top form this season, last weekend celebrating his 100th appearance in the red and blue of Palace.

He recently returned from international duty with DR Congo, where he played a starring role in their Africa Cup of Nations campaign.

Bolasie helped his country to third place, but attention has now turned from Equatorial Guinea to England, and more specifically to West Ham this Saturday.

'We have good memories from the game last season, and hopefully it'll be a similar outcome,' Bolasie continues, referring to the Eagles' 1-0 win at Upton Park last April.

'We have top players and we were winning games while I was away in Africa, so West Ham will know we can cause them damage.

'They have great players too, but we know we can go there and win.'
