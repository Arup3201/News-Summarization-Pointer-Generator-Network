Jailed: Philip Gaisford, 64, a former Scotland Yard chief superintendent, was found guilty of 27 offences against nine boys and girls

A retired top police officer who set up a scuba diving business so he could groom young boys for sex has been jailed for life.

Philip Gaisford, 64, used his six-figure retirement pay off to build a swimming pool at his £1.5m home.

The former Scotland Yard chief superintendent enticed dozens of children with scuba lessons and pool parties.

But he abused his trusted position to single out potential victims who he plied with sparkling wine as he enforced a ‘no trunks’ policy.

The case raises worrying questions about how he was able to prey on young people for so long without being stopped.

The pervert was arrested in 2000 when a boy claimed he was sexually abused after Gaisford organised work experience for him at the Met.

But the investigation was dropped, leaving Gaisford free to continue running his seedy scuba diving business for another decade.

During that time hundreds of young people visited his home in Crowborough, East Sussex, for group lessons and private tuition.

Lewes Crown Court heard how Gaisford was finally brought to justice after an acrimonious divorce from his wife Susan, 62.

The couple moved to East Sussex after she twice caught him naked with young men at their previous home in Caterham, Surrey.

She gave him a second chance but tipped off police about child abuse images on his computer when he admitted having sex with a 15-year-old boy.

Officers arrested him and discovered a stash of handcuffs and flick knives which Gaisford had confiscated during his 30-year career with the Met.

Suspicious detectives began contacting potential victims as they examined paperwork from the scuba business. Among them was the victim from the 2000 case.

They discovered Gaisford was at the centre of a horrific web of abuse which took place around pools at both properties.

He used the scuba diving business as a front to create opportunities when he could be alone with the most vulnerable young people and abuse them.

Gaisford also attracted dozens of scouts by renting out a large field beside his sprawling rural property.

Prosecutor Mark Gadsden said Gaisford encouraged his pupils – many of whom saw him as a ‘father figure’ – to remove their swimming trunks

He said Gaisford held ‘pool parties’ at which he molested boys and girls who ‘did not want to be touched in that way’ and nick-named him 'paedo-Phil'.

He added: ‘He was able to manipulate these young people and persuade them and himself that there was nothing wrong with it.’

The court heard Gaisford organised scuba diving trips to Egypt during which he was ‘very touchy feely’ and set up reunion parties when they returned.

Jurors were shown pictures of him in a pair of speedos drinking and encouraging young people to wax his chest hair off.

In one image the words ‘insert here’ were written on Gaisford's back with an arrow pointing downwards, alongside a lewd drawing.

In emotional evidence, one victim told the court he was raped and abused for three years after falling under Gaisford’s spell as a scout.

The man said he was made to wear ‘tight swimming trunks’ which he was ordered to remove for a sauna after scuba lessons.

He said the sexual abuse started with Gaisford ‘massaging’ him naked. It then progressed from naked swimming to kissing and sex.

At one point Gaisford claimed to give him a ‘medical examination’ by inserting a finger into his body, which he said he was doing to check his prostate.

The man, who was 16 at the time of the abuse, said: ‘I was scared of him telling my parents about all of it.

‘I didn't know what he was capable of, although he was nice to me I have seen him be not so nice to other people.’

The victim finally went to police when he tried to cut off Gaisford and the former police officer threatened to tell his family about what had happened.

Jailed: Gaisford was first arrested in 2000 when a boy claimed he was sexually abused, but the investigation was dropped

Gaisford, who retired from the Met in 1999 amid questions over his attendance record, served in Soho and Mayfair.

He then went on to work for another Government agency before being sacked in 2003 on his conviction for assaulting police officers after being caught drink driving.

The pervert admitted to police that he had the ‘Gaisford curse’, meaning he had a high sex drive, which he found hard to ‘keep in check’.

He blamed child abuse images on his computer, many of which had a ‘spanking’ theme, on being sent boarding school as a child.

Gaisford, who has been in custody since August, was convicted of 27 sexual offences against nine victims – including four boys and two girls – between 1997 and 2008.

His youngest victim was a 13-year-old boy. He was also convicted of raping an adult woman and 10 offences of possessing indecent videos of children.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve a minimum of 12 years before he can apply for parole when he was jailed last Friday.

Det Insp Rob Morland, of Sussex Police, said the former police officer was only brought to justice thanks to the courage of his victims.

He said: ‘Gaisford systematically and cynically abused trusting young people who had become involved with him in his capacity as a scuba diving instructor and the court clearly found his conduct to be a gross breach of trust.’
