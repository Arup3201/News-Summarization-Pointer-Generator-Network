The exact details of what happened are still being investigated by Morrocan police and Virgin Limited Editions Holidays but Mr Hulse’s bike is thought to have tipped over.

The tragedy happened in late July and Mr Hulse’s funeral was held on Friday at Sandridge, Hertfordshire.

An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned.

Sally said: 'Our lives will never be the same. We are traumatised by the shock and devastation we are feeling. 

'Jamie was well respected, kind and considerate. He always had time for everyone despite being exhausted from the unsociable working hours and his short life was filled with fun, laughter and happiness- he will be sorely missed, but never forgotten.'

Jamie was the youngest of four sons of a couple who owned greengrocers shops.

Jamie grew up with the business and started work at aged just 12 accompanying his father to fruit and veg markets in London.

He went on to build his own business; running a wholesale company supplying companies throughout the country.
