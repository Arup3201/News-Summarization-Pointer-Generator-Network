England and France will meet in a winner-takes-all showdown on Tuesday to determine which nation makes July's UEFA Under-19 European Championships in Greece.

Both recorded victories on Saturday to maintain their perfect records and take their Elite Round qualifying group to the wire.

England squeezed past Azerbaijan 1-0 in Bayeux thanks to a first-half winner from Manchester City's Ashley Smith-Brown, his second decisive goal in two matches.

France, meanwhile, beat Denmark 2-0 to lead the way on goal difference, meaning that Sean O'Driscoll's Young Lions must beat them in Saint-Lo to take the group's only qualifcation spot.

As expected, England dominated possession and chances against Azerbaijan, but could only convert one of them.

It came eight minutes before half-time when Smith-Brown collected the ball wide on the left, cut inside and curled a lovely shot into the far corner.

Confidence was high in the England camp after twice coming from behind to beat Denmark 3-2 on Thursday and this game reverted to type almost immediately.

Faced with an Azerbaijan team with 11 men behind the ball, England knew they would have to be patient and their first effort came from range when Fulham's Patrick Roberts saw a 25-yarder tipped over by goalkeeper Tolga Sahin.

Lewis Cook, of Leeds United, fired narrowly off target when debutant Aaron Kuhl, of Reading, picked him out on the edge of the penalty area.

That pressure eventually told when right-back Smith-Brown marauded forward to score what would prove to be the game's decisive goal.

The second-half, unsurprisingly, followed a similar pattern, with Roberts and Kuhl going close during its early stages.

Azerbaijan's one and only attack of note culminated in Elnur Jafarov firing wide of the far post when well-placed.

Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek had the ball in the net three minutes from time only to be flagged offside but the one goal was sufficient as England set up their showdown with France.
