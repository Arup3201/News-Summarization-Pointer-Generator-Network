Sam Robson grew up in Sydney supporting Australia but he became the latest new face to provide encouragement for England’s fresh start by repeating Gary Ballance’s feat at Lord’s of scoring a century in his second Test.

There is no question that Robson is fully entitled to appear for his mother’s country after making his life in England and turning his back on overtures from Australia when it became clear last year that he would play at the highest level.

Yet nationality is a perennially thorny issue in cricket and it will not go unnoticed that the two young,  talented batsmen who put England in a strong position in this second and final Test both played for other countries at Under-19 level.

Only when cloud cover returned to Headingley after tea and suddenly the ball nibbled around did Sri Lanka puncture England’s day of dominance, taking four cheap wickets in the final session to keep themselves in the hunt for the second Test.

Milestone: Sam Robson hit his first Test century on his second appearance for England

Composed: Robson looked assured at the crease and his 127 helped England into a position of preponderance

Much has 
been made of the need for ‘Englishness’ in the national team in this new
 era, yet Robson learned his trade in the shadow of the Sydney Cricket 
Ground while Ballance, his partner in a stand of 142 here, is from 
Zimbabwe.

Geoff
 Miller, who resigned as national selector last winter, used to say he 
would always look into the eyes of any dual-nationality recruit to make 
sure they had the passion, desire and correct motivation to play for 
England.

Well,
 if Miller had looked into Robson’s eyes he would have seen a 
fiercely determined, old-fashioned opening batsman who is likely to be a
 prolific, if not always entertaining, member of this England team for 
years to come.

To
 be at Headingley was to almost step back in time to the days when Geoff
 Boycott would have the locals in thrall to his accumulative methods and
 a scoring rate of just under three runs an over would be positively 
giddy.

Robson
 is a friend and contemporary of David Warner but he could hardly be 
more different, both as a man and a batsman. His steady, unspectacular 
style and under-stated manner are almost an antidote to the excesses of 
the modern game.

His
 efforts were certainly appreciated by this knowledgeable Yorkshire 
crowd as Robson’s 127 in an England reply of 320 for six to 
Sri Lanka’s 257, a lead of 63 after two days, was greeted with rich, 
appreciative applause. At the forefront of those who rose to  Robson 
were his parents.

Born in New South Wales to an Australian father and an English mother from Nottinghamshire, the 24-year-old plays for Middlesex.

Australia batsman Chris Rogers took Robson ‘for a few pints’ in a bid to persuade him to play for the Aussies rather than England.

Played at Under-19 level for Australia before becoming eligible to play for England in 2013.

In 2009, he hit a maiden first-class century in his debut season against Essex at Lord’s.

In 2012, he became the first batsman in history to score a first-class hundred in England in the month of March with a ton against Durham MCC University.

Was the leading run-scorer in the 2013 County Championship (933 runs at an average of 62.06).

Made his England Test debut against Sri Lanka on June 12, scoring 1 and 19.

His
 dad ‘Jungle’ Jim coaches at the SCG and flew from Sydney ahead of the 
first Test to watch his son’s first steps as a ‘genuine’ Englishman and 
watch on intently at Headingley.

How
 England needed the graft and grind of Robson, who moved to 
London six years ago and made his name with Middlesex before scoring 
five centuries last winter for the England Lions to confirm his 
allegiance.

He
 had seen his captain Alastair Cook, desperately in need of a hundred 
with pressure growing on his captaincy, add just three runs to his 
overnight 14 before falling to his old failing — a full delivery just 
outside off-stump.

England
 could not afford any more cheap wickets if they were to build a score 
that would define this decisive Investec Test and they had the perfect 
pair in Robson and Ballance to steady the ship and chip away at Sri 
Lanka.

Paul
 Downton, the England managing director, wants the team to be positive 
at all times but, with the Headingley conditions still giving assistance
 to the Sri Lankan attack, there was a need for good old-fashioned 
digging in. That is Robson’s game and here he shrugged off the 
uncertainty of his nervy debut last week to unfurl his favoured cover 
drives and that strength off his hip that has raised, perhaps 
prematurely, comparisons with Mike Atherton.

Pulling rank: Ian Bell hit 64 after Sri Lanka wilted in the Yorkshire heat

In focus: Gary Ballance continued where he left off at Lord's, scoring 74 on his home ground

Robson
 is hardly a product of the Twenty20 generation but he did show that he 
could hit high and straight, notably when he lofted Rangana Herath for a
 straight six and held his perfectly straight bat in a textbook pose.

By
 that time Robson had passed three figures and had also lost Ballance, 
who was not as fluent as in his Lord’s century but again showed enough 
quality to fully justify the faith of a new selection panel who are yet 
to put a foot wrong.

Ballance
 was actually given out lbw on 31 to Herath but what appeared an 
optimistic review against Billy Bowden’s decision was proved justified 
when technology suggested the ball would miss the adopted Yorkshireman’s
 leg stump.

He
 also could have been run out or caught at short leg before Angelo 
Mathews, doing the job his frontline seamers struggled to accomplish, 
put the ball in the right place to take the edge of Ballance’s bat and 
dismiss him for 74.

At sixes and sevens: Since scoring a century against New Zealand at Headingley last summer, Cook has scored 585 runs in 23 innings at an average of 25.4

When
 Robson followed him, bowled through the gate by Nuwan Pradeep, the 
stage was set for Ian Bell in his 100th Test and he did not disappoint 
initially as he raced along to 64 to take England beyond Sri Lanka’s 
below-par total.

He
 looked certain to celebrate his landmark in the grand manner until 
Shaminda Eranga strangled him down the leg side. When Joe Root quickly 
followed a window of opportunity had suddenly opened for Sri Lanka.

Moeen
 Ali fell to another loose drive as three English wickets fell for two 
runs but Matt Prior and Chris Jordan just about got through to the close
 to keep England on top.
