The head of the GCHQ is standing down amid controversy over the damaging revelations made by US whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Security sources insisted that Sir Iain Lobban, 53, who has run the Cheltenham listening post since 2008, was always due to quit, labelling the timing ‘pure coincidence’.

But insiders made clear that the crisis engulfing the eavesdropping agency may now lead to an outsider being installed as the new director general.

The Snowden leaks lifted the lid on the scale of GCHQ’s role with America’s National Security Agency in monitoring electronic communications around  the world.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed that Sir Iain would be leaving later this year.

Officials stressed that he is ‘moving on’ not ‘stepping down’ but did not say where he is moving on to.

Some senior figures are understood to believe that his successor needs to be better at convincing the public that GCHQ is a vital cornerstone of national security, rather than the threat to freedom that critics have claimed.

Sir Iain’s counterparts at the NSA, General Keith Alexander and his deputy John Inglis, are also stepping down this year.

Sir Iain Lobban will leave his role in November and an advertisement seeking his successor has begun circulating in Whitehall.

A senior Downing Street source described the timing as ‘pure coincidence’ and added: ‘He was doing a very strong job.’

Among those being tipped to succeed Mr Lobban is Charles Farr, director of counter-terrorism at the Home Office.

Whitehall’s leading ‘securocrat’, Farr began his intelligence career as a frontline officer with MI6.

Oliver Robbins, who recently left the post of Deputy National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister and Robert Hannigan, director-general of Defence and Intelligence at the Foreign Office could also be considered if officials want to pick an outsider.

A Whitehall source told the Mail: ‘Charles Farr is always going to be in the frame. We will look inside GCHQ and outside GCHQ. There is no rush. It’s an important job and we’ll make sure we get the right person.’

Whoever gets the job will command a staff of 6,000 and control the bulk of the £2 billion intelligence budget, which also pays for MI5 and MI6.

Sir Iain is a career GCHQ officer and insiders at the Cheltenham HQ are keen to have another one of their own in charge.

Richard Aldrich, Professor of International Security at the University of Warwick and author of a history of GCHQ, said the appointment would be a ‘litmus test’ of the Government’s confidence in the agency.

‘If they appoint someone from outside GCHQ, that will be interpreted inside the organisation as a smack in the face,’ he said.

'GCHQ remain far too secretive, they have 
refused to explain what they do and why it is important. They’ve left a 
huge vacuum which has been filled by Snowden’s version of events'

‘There is a strong case for an insider. One thing we have learnt from the Snowden revelations is just how successful GCHQ has been in raw intelligence terms - it has about 15 per cent of the budget of the National Security Agency but does 30 per cent of the business of its American partner.

‘But they remain far too secretive, they have refused to explain what they do and why it is important. They’ve left a huge vacuum which has been filled by Snowden’s version of events.

‘The next director has to be someone who will take GCHQ out of the shadows but also be someone who understands the business.’

Sir Iain seemed uncomfortable with the limelight when he was questioned by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee alongside the heads of MI5 and MI6, Andrew Parker and Sir John Sawers.

Lord Foulkes, a former member of committee, said: ‘I think he was doing a good job. He impressed when I was on the ISC. GCHQ is vital for national security and the recent publicity may have undermined this.’

Sir Iain’s counterparts at the NSA, General Keith Alexander and his deputy John Inglis, are also stepping down this year.
