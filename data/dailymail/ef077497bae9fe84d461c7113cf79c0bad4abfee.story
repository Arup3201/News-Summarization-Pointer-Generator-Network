The atmosphere on Mars was once thicker, warmer and wetter than it is today until it was damaged in a 'catastrophic collision' with a planet the size of Pluto, scientists claim.

Data collected by Nasa's Curiosity rover suggests the Red Planet's atmosphere once had more oxygen in it than Earth, giving serious weight to the theory it could have previously harboured alien life.

Yet a major upheaval, thought to have been caused when a Pluto-sized planet collided into Mars billions of years ago, created a shift in gases that led to the atmosphere around it to shrink.

Theory: There was interest in what may have existed in the past on Mars, after Curiosity found that much of the planet's atmosphere has been lost over time, suggesting it was once warmer

A team of Nasa scientists claim that a change in the ratio of two different kinds of argon gas is evidence that the atmosphere has been stripped away.

Nasa's Dr Chris Webster said: 'As Mars became a planet and its magma ocean solidified, catastrophic 
outgassing occurred while volatiles were delivered by impact of comets 
and other smaller bodies.

'Solar wind, and the 
possible impact by a Pluto-sized body is thought to have stripped much 
of the initial early atmosphere from the planet, and since then the 
atmosphere has developed as a balance between volcanic injection and 
loss to space.'

The Nasa scientists were investigating the atmosphere after one of their telescopes on Earth had detected a surprising and mysterious amount of 
methane in three regions in the Martian western hemisphere.

This presence of methane could have suggested there was some form of life living on the planet.

Yet the Curiosity rover did not find any 
methane, which has disappointed those who believe microbes may still 
linger there.

On Earth, methane is mainly a 
by-product of life - from animal digestion and decaying plants - and the
 gas can also be produced by non-biological processes. 

Disappointment: Last year, the Curiosity team reported no definitive whiff of methane near the landing site, and since then, the rover has taken several more air samples

But last year, the Curiosity team 
reported no definitive whiff of methane near the landing site, and since
 then, the rover has taken several more air samples.

There are also plans to sniff the 
atmosphere during a drive to the Mount Sharp mountain. And in the 
autumn NASA is set to launch a Mars-orbiting spacecraft aimed at solving
 the methane mystery.

Called Maven, the craft will target 
the Martian atmosphere. Scientists want to know if it actually exists, 
determine the abundance and whether that varies by year or location.

'The fact that it’s turned out to be 
pretty much disproven - it’s not a surprise, but a disappointment 
perhaps,' planetary scientist Adrian Brown of the SETI Institute in California, told 
Wired magazine.

The Curiosity found the air is made 
mostly of carbon dioxide. This closely matched what the twin Viking 
landers detected in the late 1970s and what scientists have gleaned from
 Martian meteorites.

And there was also interest in what 
may have existed in the past on Mars, after Curiosity found that much of
 the planet’s atmosphere has been lost over time, suggesting it was once
 warmer.

This would have been more conducive to
 liquid water flowing on the surface - and potentially even life 
existing on the planet, reported Wired.

Mars' atmosphere is overwhelmingly 
dominated by carbon dioxide, unlike Earth's air, which is a mix of 
nitrogen and oxygen. However, there was still a small surprise.

Viking found nitrogen to be the second
 most abundant gas in the Martian air, but Curiosity's measurements 
revealed a nearly equal abundance of nitrogen and argon, a stable noble 
gas.

Mission scientists are puzzled, but suspect it might have to do with the different tools used to sample the atmosphere.

‘It's more or less an interesting 
observation’ but doesn't change the notion that Mars lost most of its 
original atmosphere to space, transforming the planet into a cold 
desert, said Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who is 
in charge of Curiosity's air sampling experiments.
