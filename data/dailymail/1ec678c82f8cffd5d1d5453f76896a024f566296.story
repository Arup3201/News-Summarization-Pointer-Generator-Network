A former Labour minister jailed for six months for fraudulently claiming £13,000 in parliamentary expenses today tweeted he is out after six weeks, thanking prosecutors for the 'fascinating' time behind bars.

Disgraced former Labour minister Denis MacShane took a swipe at prosecutors for pursuing 'celebrity' cases,comparing himself with Coronation Street star Bill Roache as he was released from jail.

Prison is 'the place' to go to to lose weight and get fit and is 'fascinating', the ex-MP added as he walked free just six weeks into his six month sentence for fraudulent expenses claims totalling nearly £13,000.

MacShane lashed out at former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer for being 'very keen' on celebrity prosecutions and linked himself to Roache, who was yesterday cleared of alleged sex offences.

Former Labour minister Denis MacShane was jailed for fraudulently claiming nearly £13,000 in expenses. He tweeted today that he is out of jail after six weeks, after being sentenced to six months behind bars

He told the Daily Mirror: 'It's been quite a week for the celebrity prosecution people Keir Starmer was very keen on - the DPP.

'But I'm not talking about what happened or the other MPs who made so much money and haven't been held to account.

MacShane called the experience 'fascinating' and said he met some 'very good people' behind bars

'That's for another time, another day, but I'm obviously glad to be out.

'I really met some very good people inside prison.

'I wouldn't say I'd recommend it to anybody, but certainly if you want to lose weight and get fit it's the place.'

He added: 'Bill Roache yesterday, me today. It's Keir Starmer's little angels.'

MacShane, 65, pleaded guilty to false accounting by filing 19 fake receipts for "research and translation" services and was jailed two days before Christmas.

As he was released from HMP Brixton the former Europe minister told the Daily Mirror: 'It's been a fascinating six weeks. I was last in prison in Communist Poland.

'I've met very interesting people. I've met a lot of people who know the difference between right and wrong, between truth and mendacity and are really prepared to admit to mistakes they've made in the past.

'It's very different from the House of Commons in that regard.

'I've been well treated by the prisoners, I've learnt a lot. It's been a humbling, rewarding and enriching experience.

'I've lost weight, I'm fitter than I've been for the last 10 years and I'm glad now to get back and see my children, family and friends.'

He added: 'I spent my time as I spent all my life, thinking, writing, talking to people, making notes.

'I've been keeping fit and for the first time certainly eating more healthily and not drinking anything.'

The 65-year-old thanked prosecutors for the 'fascinating humbling' experience. The one-time BBC journalist added he would be giving no interviews about his time inside

MacShane also said he had given talks on politics while serving his sentence - and had made copious notes about the experience.

He said: 'I've been keeping notes, just like a good journalist. I've interviewed tons of people and what's fascinating about prisons is that in 20 years I never thought about prisons in my life.

'No MP, no civil servant, no journalist has the faintest idea what it's like.'

The one-time BBC journalist had admitted faking 19 invoices for ‘research and translation services’ amounting to £12,900 between 2005 and 2008.

He submitted them through a company that he set up under a false identity and used nine different spellings of his name so officials would think the paperwork had been filled in by others. 

A minister for Europe under Tony Blair, MacShane used the money to fund trips to the Continent, including one to judge a literary competition in Paris.

Jailing him, Mr Justice Sweeney said his ‘considerable and repeated’ dishonesty had ‘reduced confidence in our priceless democratic system’.

‘There was deliberate, oft repeated and prolonged dishonesty over a period of years – involving a flagrant breach of trust and consequent damage to Parliament,’ he said.

‘You were an MP – and a minister at the time of four of the claims – and knew that you were required to act with probity and transparency in the making of expenses claims. You deliberately created misleading and deceptive invoices and then used them in order to procure payments of public money.’

Mr Justice Sweeney said the deception was calculated to avoid suspicion falling on his claims before adding: ‘You have no one to blame but yourself.’

Parliamentary authorities began looking at MacShane’s claims in 2009 when the expenses scandal engulfed Westminster.

John Lyon, the Commons’ Standards Commissioner, raised concerns over claims for ‘translation services’ from the European Policy Institute – a think-tank that he founded.

MacShane first admitted to officials that he had submitted invoices signed with what he called ‘a nom de plume’ and described the EPI as a ‘convenient vehicle’ to fund research trips to the continent.

But a subsequent investigation by the Commons’ Standards and Privileges Committee described his actions as the ‘gravest case which has come to us for adjudication, rather than being dealt with under the criminal law’.

It recommended that MacShane should be suspended as an MP for 12 months but he resigned as the member for Rotherham in November 2012 before the punishment could be imposed.

Police, who had dropped an investigation in 2009, reopened their inquiry and MacShane was charged in May.

He was the sixth MP to be prosecuted over expenses and admitted false accounting at the Old Bailey last month.

Notably absent from court was his girlfriend, Vicky Pryce, 61, the ex-wife of Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne. She was released in May after serving two months for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after she took the blame for speeding points that should have been picked up by Huhne, the former energy secretary, who was also jailed.

The invoices were signed by MacShane under the name of E.J. Matthews, the general manager of the company based at an address in Fulham, south-west London.

The ex-wife of disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne vowed to stand by her boyfriend Denis MacShane when he was jailed at the end of last year

The ex-wife of disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne said she would stand by her boyfriend, Denis MacShane, after judges jailed him for fiddling his expenses.

Vicky Pryce, who has been dating MacShane for around 18 months, said she hoped their romance would survive his prison sentence.

Their relationship started shortly before Ms Pryce was herself jailed last March for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points from her ex-husband to stop him losing his licence.

Mr MacShane supported Ms Pryce, 61, during her two-month prison ordeal.

The exposure of MacShane’s crime followed two reports in The Mail on Sunday in 2009, which revealed how he submitted false expense claims for ‘translation services’.

MacShane has had a chequered love life.

He lived with the late ITN newscaster Carol Barnes from 1975 to 1981, although the couple never married. 

In 1983, he married Polish-born Liliana Klaptoc, but they later divorced. In 1987, MacShane married Nathalie Pham, but the couple divorced in 2003.

His relationship with feminist writer Joan Smith ended in 2010.
