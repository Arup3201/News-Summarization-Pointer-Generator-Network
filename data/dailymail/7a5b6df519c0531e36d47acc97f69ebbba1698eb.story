If you're tempted to join the Free The Nipple movement but not quite brave enough to bare it all, a new bikini brand provides a happy compromise.

Designed by Chicago-based feminists Robyn Graves and Michelle Lytle, the TaTa Top is a skin colored bikini adorned with nipples, giving the very convincing illusion of toplessness.

The cheeky swimwear, which comes in its original nude hue as well as medium and dark skin tones, costs $28 per top, with $5 of each sale put towards a breast cancer research foundation.

Made you look! If you're tempted to join the Free The NIpple movement but not quite brave enough to bare it all, this TaTa Top bikini provides a happy compromise

Cheeky: Designed by Chicago-based feminists Robyn Graves and Michelle Lytle, the TaTa Top is a skin colored bikini adorned with nipples, giving the illusion of toplessness

Robyn and Michelle write on their website that they launched the bikini top with the aim of desexualizing the nipple.

'The only excitement that comes from seeing breasts is that you are conditioned to think they are something special, something to be protected and kept hidden,' reads the website.

'In reality they are excess breast tissue growing into varying sized balls that you have to buy expensive support for and that throw you off balance when you run.'

Michelle added in an interview with Salon that by making the wearer look like she is baring her nipples, the TaTa Top exposes people to the idea of toplessness, thereby lessening the shock factor.

Exposure: 'If people look around and see this everywhere, then who cares if you can legitimately be topless? Because you're already seeing it,' said Michelle

'I think that the important thing about this product is that, if people look around and see this everywhere, then who cares if you can legitimately be topless? Because you're already seeing it,' she said.

Though they are not directly affiliated, the TaTa Top was in part inspired by the Free The Nipple movement launched by filmmaker Lina Esco and made popular by Bruce Willis' daughter Scout.

In May, Scout paraded through New York City - where female toplessness is legal - in just a skirt, posting pictures of herself to Twitter with the hashtag #FreeTheNipple.

She later explained the logic behind her topless posts in an article on XOJane, writing: 'Women are regularly kicked off Instagram for posting photos with any portion of the areola exposed, while photos sans nipple - degrading as they might be - remain unchallenged.

'So I walked around New York topless and documented it on Twitter, pointing out that what is legal by New York state law is not allowed on Instagram.'

She added: 'What I am arguing for is a woman's right to choose how she represents her body - and to make that choice based on personal desire and not a fear of how people will react to her or how society will judge her. No woman should be made to feel ashamed of her body.'
