A son who surprised his mother by paying off her mortgage posted a heartwarming video of her reaction online.

The footage, in which the Canadian man can be seen handing his Ethiopian mother an envelope containing a cheque, has been watched more than half a million times in the space of two days.

As it dawns on his mother what the cheque means, for several seconds she can only say one thing: 'Wow.'

Gesture: A Canadian man who surprised his Ethiopian mother by paying off her mortgage posted a video of her overwhelmed reaction online

She then says, according to the translation of her words on screen: 'Tonight I will not sleep for fear of dying of happiness.'

Her son, known only as YouTube user iProjectAtlas, posted the video online with the title 'Dear Mother'.

He said in a caption that, while he was 'by no means a perfect son', he wanted to 'do right by a very special woman in my life'.

He went on to say that giving her the means to pay off her mortgage could not amount to even one-tenth of what she had done for him in his life.

'I
don't expect everyone to understand but I just wanted to share that, to
see what a small gesture can do for those closest to us,' he wrote.
