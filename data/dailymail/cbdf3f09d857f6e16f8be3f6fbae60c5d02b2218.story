Notorious Australian gangster Mark 'Chopper' Read has been banned from working with children after firing a starting pistol at his son's athletics club.

Read, whose life story was turned into a 2000 film starring Eric Bana, recently officiated at a Collingwood Little Athletics Club race meeting in Melbourne.

But when other parents complained, he was subjected to an official check because of his extensive, and violent, criminal record.

Permission for Read, who boasts he 
has killed 19 people and served 23 years in prison for his numerous 
crimes, to work with children has now been denied by Australia's 
Department of Justice.

Read is currently in hospital fighting a serious illness.

Rather than fight the ban, he has removed his son Roy, 8, from the club in protest.

But he claims he 'should have been given the chance'.

He told Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper: 'Who would it have hurt?

'It is insulting because the ordinary crim - bank robbers, car thieves and burglars - they don't interfere with children.

'It's priests, boy scout leaders, teachers and other effeminate characters that interfere with kiddies.

'But crooks like me don't interfere with children. It is insulting to even be put in that class.'

Read's son had been attending the athletics club for a year before he was withdrawn.

A spokesman for Collingwood Little 
Athletics Club said the organisation would have allowed Read to start 
races for them if his safety check had been approved by the government.

Chopper, the film based on Read's semi-autobiographical books, has a cult following.
