An undercover police officer who posed as an environmental activist reportedly co-wrote a libellous leaflet that attacked McDonald’s and triggered the longest civil trial in English history.

One of the authors of the so-called McLibel leaflet is former police officer Bob Lambert according to a book on undercover policing by Guardian journalists Paul Lewis and Rob Evans.

It is claimed in the book, which is released on Monday, that Lambert co-wrote the defamatory six-page leaflet in 1986 - and his role in its production has been the subject of an internal Scotland Yard investigation for several months.

Mr Lambert is said to have used the alias Bob Robinson during his five years infiltrating the London Greenpeace group, when he was with the special demonstration squad (SDS), a now-disbanded Metropolitan Police unit that targeted political activists.

McDonald’s famously sued two green campaigners over the leaflet in a landmark three-year high court case, that was widely considered to have been a public relations disaster for the corporation.

However it was never suggested during the costly civil legal proceedings brought by McDonalds in the 1990s that an undercover police officer helped write the leaflet.

A raft of allegations have been made against undercover police in recent months including claims officers used dead children’s identities and that some had sexual relationships with the targets of their operations.

Mr Lambert now works as a lecturer in terrorism studies at the University of St Andrews, in Scotland.

An investigation into undercover policing, called Operation Herne, has been launched by the Metrepolitan Police.

Helen Steel and David Morris were sued by the McDonalds corporation after they published a leaflet attacking the company

Derbyshire Police Chief Constable 
Mick Creedon was brought in to oversee the operation and recently 
confirmed it was 'common practice' for undercover officers within the 
SDS to use dead children’s identities.

A
statement from the Metropolitan Police said the force 'recognises the 
seriousness of the allegations of inappropriate behaviour and practices 
involving past undercover deployments'.

It
said: 'Operation Herne is a live investigation, four strands of which 
are being supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, 
and it would be inappropriate to pre-judge its findings.

'The Metropolitan Police Service must balance the genuine public interest in these matters with its duty to protect officers and former officers who have been deployed undercover, often in difficult and dangerous circumstances.

'We are therefore not prepared to 
confirm nor deny the identity of individuals alleged in the media to 
have been working undercover, nor confirm nor deny the deployment of 
individuals on specific operations.

The case became the longest running civil case in English history and only ended when the pair took it to the European Court of Human Rights

'It
is also important to recognise that any actions by officers working on 
or with the Special Demonstration Squad need to be understood by 
Operation Herne in terms of the leadership, supervision, support, 
training, legal framework, tasking and reporting mechanisms that were in
place at the time.

'At some point it will fall upon this generation of police leaders to account for the activities of our predecessors, but for the moment we must focus on getting to the truth.'

Mr Lambert has also admitted that he tricked an innocent woman into having an 18-month relationship with him to apparently bolster his cover story.

He started dating the woman in the 1980s as he infiltrated Greenpeace to get into the hardline Animal Liberation Front.

McDonald's Corporation v Steel & Morris, known as ‘the McLibel case’, was a lawsuit filed by McDonald's Corporation against activists Helen Steel and David Morris in1997.

Beginning in 1986, London Greenpeace, a small environmental campaigning group, distributed a pamphlet entitled What’s wrong with McDonald’s: Everything they don’t want you to know.

The leaflet accused the McDonald's Corporation of unethical practices

This publication made a number of allegations against McDonald's. The leading allegations were that McDonald's:

Lasting ten years, it became the longest running civil suit in English
history.

Despite McDonald's won in part two hearings of the case, they announced that they would not collect the £40,000 that was awarded to them. This was due to the partial nature of the victory, and that it was seen as a David and Goliath style case.

The judge in the original hearing confirmed many of the allegations made in the pamphlet were true. On appeal, two more claims made in the pamphlet were given credence by the courts.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in Steel & Morris v United Kingdom that the pair had been denied a fair trial, in breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and that their conduct should have been protected by Article 10 of the Convention. The court awarded a judgment of £57,000 against the UK government.

The woman has admitted that she is still damaged by the experience.

She told the Guardian that she was 
convinced the romantic, polite and charismatic Lambert was her ideal man
- and had a long-term future with him.

But 18 months into their relationship
the decorated officer disappeared and told her he was moving to Spain 
because he feared being caught by the police.

Two Guardian journalists allege that Lambert was a co-writer of the McLibel leaflet

She told the Guardian: 'I was cruelly
tricked and it has made me very angry. I am actually quite damaged by 
the whole thing. I am still not over it.'

Having a partner that believed his cover story meant that Lambert could infiltrate the group more easily.

The former officer told the website 
Spinwatch in a response to their open letter: 'I apologise unreservedly 
for the deception I therefore practiced on law abiding members of London
Greenpeace.

'I also apologise unreservedly for 
forming false friendships with law abiding citizens and in particular 
forming a long term relationship with (the woman) who had every reason 
to think I was a committed animal rights activist and a genuine London 
Greenpeace campaigner.'

He added: 'I should point out here 
that the vast majority of Met special branch undercover officers never 
made the mistakes I made, have no need to apologise for anything, and I 
deeply regret having tarnished their illustrious, professional 
reputation.

'My deceptions in the 1980s were all premised on maintaining the fiction required to perform my undercover role.'

In the late 1990s, Mr Lambert became 
head of the Special Demonstration Squad and was responsible for placing 
police moles in political organisations.

From 2002 to 2007, he was in charge 
of Scotland Yard's Muslim Contact Unit, tasked with preventing Islamic 
extremism by way of two-way dialogue with the Muslim community.

Since 2006, he has lectured at Exeter and St Andrew's universities.
