Boris Johnson has issued a stinging rebuke to Michael Gove for daring to suggest that he is ‘unfit’ to succeed David Cameron.

The London Mayor fired off a thinly veiled message to the Education Secretary to concentrate on  getting Mr Cameron re-elected and stop gossiping about the talents of other top Tories.

Mr Johnson also fuelled speculation that he will soon announce his intention to return to the Commons at the General Election next year.

Smiling for the camera: Gove with Boris Johnson last year

The Mail on Sunday revealed last month how Mr Gove, seen by some Tories as a future leadership  contender, had launched an extraordinary verbal assault on Mr Johnson’s own credentials.

The Education Secretary stunned guests at a private dinner at the London home of Rupert Murdoch with a wine-fuelled attack, saying: ‘The whole Boris routine will wear thin the electorate very quickly if he became PM. And he can’t make tough decisions.’

A ‘tipsy’ Mr Gove added: ‘Boris is incapable of focusing on serious issues and has no gravitas. He isn’t a team player and plays to the gallery the whole time.’

But challenged to respond to the attacks, Mr Johnson made it clear he thinks it is the Education Secretary – not him – who is no team player.

In an interview with Paul Waugh and Sam Macrory of Total Politics magazine, Mr Johnson declared: ‘I’m at one with the vast majority of the population that wants to hear a lot less about what other Conservatives have got to say about each other and much more about what we’re going to do to win the Election.’

He implied that senior party figures speculating on each other’s abilities only detracted from the ‘mission’ of getting Mr Cameron re-elected. And of his own ambitions, he said: ‘People want to hear a lot less about my career and anybody else’s career, and they want to hear a lot about how we are going to stop Ed Miliband, who would be a disaster.’

Only last week, Mr Cameron stepped up his appeal for Mr Johnson to return to Westminster, sparking reports of a ‘bidding war’ among party activists in safe Tory seats desperate for Boris to be their MP.

But asked about Mr Cameron’s desire to see him ‘back on the pitch’ at Westminster, Mr Johnson replied: ‘My job is to help the Tory cause in any way that I can, by running London to the best of my ability.’

One of the main objections to Mr Johnson returning as an MP – and being able to stand in a Tory leadership contest – is that his term as London mayor still has two years to run.

But he appeared intrigued by the fact that Ken Livingstone had spent one year being both a Labour MP and running City Hall. ‘Did he?’ asked Mr Johnson, before insisting his focus was on being Mayor.

Reports last week linked him with at least two safe Tory seats that will be vacant at the next Election - North-West Hampshire and Louth and Horncastle in Lincolnshire.

But Mr Johnson would not be drawn on whether he would stand outside the capital, saying: ‘I’m playing no such games.’

He also laughed off suggestions that he could do a ‘job swap’ with dashing Zac Goldsmith, Tory MP for Richmond Park on the outskirts of London, joking: ‘The biggest supporters of that are all the women in my office. In a very insulting way, they’ve told me in no uncertain terms the sooner I can swap with Zac Goldsmith the better.’
