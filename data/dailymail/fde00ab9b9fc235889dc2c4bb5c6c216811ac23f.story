The Baltimore man who claims to have inspired HBO's The Wire was arrested on federal drug and gun charges last month.

Nathan ‘Bodie’ Barksdale, AGE, had been working for Safe Streets, a city Health Department program in which former criminals help rid the streets of the violent crime they once perpetuated, when he was arrested.

Barksdale had been successful in the program, Johnson said, but he was terminated after not showing up to work on November 25, the same week he was arrested.

The Drug Enforcement Agency said Barksdale didn't cease his role as a drug boss as he has long claimed, but was instead a high-ranking official of the prison and street gang, Black Guerrilla Family.

He was arrested last month on heroin and gun charges, according to The Baltimore Sun.

Barksdale was a drug dealer in West Baltimore who purportedly survived twenty-one gunshots, some of which were fired while Barksdale was in hospital after a prior, failed murder attempt.

When he was young, a man ran over Barksdale’s leg with his truck after Barksdale stole from him. As a result, Barksdale underwent an amputation and subsequently became addicted to opiates.

In 1985, Barksdale was sentenced to fifteen years in state prison for battery. In 2003, he was acquitted of a federal charge of being a felon with a gun.

David Simon, the creator, executive producer and head writer of The Wire, denies that Nathan Barksdale or any other individual is the basis for any specific character in the show.

However, in his director's commentary to the first episode of The Wire, Simon said they tended to 'mix the names up'.

‘It’s our kind of back-handed homage to the reality of West Baltimore. There really was a Nathan Bodie Barksdale. We split that up.

‘There’s a Bodie character in this tale, there’s an Avon Barksdale character. The Barksdale family was famous in their day in West Baltimore back in the ‘80s for their endeavors in the projects.

'That’s how we’re playing it. They’re not based on real people, individually, but a character might be a composite.’
