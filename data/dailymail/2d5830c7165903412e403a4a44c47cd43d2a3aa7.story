A woman from Argentina has become the first heart transplant patient in the world to give birth to a daughter following IVF treatment.

Juliana Finondo, 39, from Buenos Aires, had a successful heart transplant in 1999, but was childless at the time.

She gave birth to baby Emilia earlier this month with the help of staff at the high risk pregnancy centre in Buenos Aires.

Doctors warned Ms Finondo against trying
for a baby following surgery because pregnancy causes women to have 40 
per cent more blood, putting extra strain on her new heart.

Juliana Finondo had been told pregnancy would put strain on her heart

Gustavo Leguizamon, head of the Buenos Aires high
risk pregnancy centre, said: 'There is no record in the world of a 
transplant patient who has achieved pregnancy through in vitro 
fertilization.

'This could lead to not enough blood 
getting to the uterus, causing the baby to grow less.'

Mr Leguizamon said a premature birth was also a possible risk.

Drugs which help avoid new organs being rejected by transplant patients make pregnancy difficult, and their effects on the unborn child are unknown.

Medication needed to perform IVF can cause further complications, according to Ricardo James, a reproductive specialist at the centre.

But the health risks did not put off graphic designer Ms Finondo, who was determined to have a child with her husband, Gerardo Tuya. She told AFP:Â  'I was never afraid. Maybe I'm too optimistic.'

IVF fertility drugs can cause complications for transplant patients hoping to get pregnant, medical experts say

1964: James Hardy attempts the first heart transplant at the University of Mississippi, using a chimpanzee heart. It beats for 90 minutes.

1967: The first successful heart transplant takes place in Cape Town. Louis Washkansky, 54, survives for 18 days with the heart of 23-year-old Denise Darvall, but later dies of pneumonia.

1968: The first UK heart transplant is performed.

1971: Organ donor cards are trialled for the first time.

1979: UK heart transplant programme is launched.

1984: A baboon heart is transplanted into a baby in California, who lives for 20 days before dying of kidney failure.

2013: Juliana Finondo becomes the first transplant recipient to give birth following IVF treatment.

In 2009 Ms Finondo decided to try to get pregnant, but by 2011 she had still had no success in conceiving naturally.

After a medical examination to check she showed no signs of rejecting her heart, doctors weaned her off transplant medication, so she could use fertility drugs needed for IVF.

Ms Finondo got pregnant on her first round of IVF, and after nine months of monitoring gave birth to her healthy daughter on January 15.

Ms Finondo's cardiologist Sergio Perrone said: 'Today a transplant patient has an excellent quality of life, much better than people realize.'

He said he also hoped the story would encourage people to consider organ donation, 'because it saves one life, which can be multiplied by so many more.'

He added that baby Emilia 'will become a mother in her time'.

In Argentina, last year 630 people donated organs to 1,458 patients, a record rate of 15.7 donors per million people.

But 7,290 patients remain on the waiting list according to government figures.
