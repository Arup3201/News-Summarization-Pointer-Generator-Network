You'd be surprised if Jorge Mendes took a holiday this summer after the Portuguese super agent represented four of the biggest transfers across Europe.

Forget Jose Mourinho, the Mendes XI would probably win the Premier League and Champions League in its first season, and he even represented his compatriot upon his move to Chelsea in 2004.

Here's the best Jorge Mendes XI at this moment, and believe us, we could have made two world class teams, we just won't mention Bebe to Manchester United.

Mourinho and Mendes negotiated a move to Chelsea from Porto in 2004 after the Special One had won the UEFA Cup and Champions League with the Portuguese giants. He spent three years at Chelsea, making plenty of friends and enemies before returning last summer.

David de Gea

After Edwin van der Sar's retirement in 2011, the Spaniard, just 20 at the time, became Manchester United's new No 1 and has remained there since. He's had his moments, but De Gea is gifted between the posts and is recognised as United's stopper for years to come.

Pepe

The Real Madrid centre back moved from Porto to the Spanish capital in 2007 for around £24million, and has had 60 caps for Portugal since. Brazil-born, Pepe has two La Liga titles and a Champions League under his belt at the age of 31.

Ricardo Carvalho

With a fantastic career behind him, 36-year-old Carvalho was another of Porto's stars to move to Chelsea in 2004. He had six years at Stamford Bridge, before playing for Real Madrid and now Monaco.

Fabio Coentrao

Mendes pushed hard to get Coentrao to Manchester United on deadline day last year, but time ran out for the Portuguese duo. Coentrao is still at Real Madrid, and has 46 caps for his country.

Stayed put: Real Madrid's Fabio Coentrao nearly moved to Manchester United last summer

Eliaquim Mangala

The big French centre back got his big move to Manchester City in the summer, and will learn plenty from partner Vincent Kompany at the Etihad. The 23-year-old is another from Porto, who have housed some of the world's best talents in the last decade.

William Carvalho

The man forever linked with a move to Manchester United, the holding midfielder is still at Sporting having spent his youth career around Portugal. Carvalho is still at the Portuguese club, but surely a move is on the cards in January.

Joao Moutinho

Moutinho cost Monaco £20million last summer, and is one of few big-money players left at the French club after a summer cull. With 71 caps at the age of 27, the midfielder was another of Mendes' men from Porto.

James Rodriguez

Moutinho moved to Monaco with Rodriguez last summer for a combined £56million, but even moneybags Mendes may not have predicted the Colombian would be the hottest property in the world after a superb World Cup. He moved to Real Madrid in July for £64million.

Angel di Maria

Despite helping Real Madrid win the Champions League last season, the Argentine was soon on his way to the Premier League with Manchester United. A £60million move represented a British record fee, and Mendes' influence in the Premier League was about to get even bigger...

Step down? Di Maria helped Real win the Champions League, but has ended up with United, out of Europe

Cristiano Ronaldo

Mendes supposedly spotted Ronaldo at a youth tournament, and the rest is history. The former Manchester United man won the Balon d'Or last season, and has been nothing but a joy to watch since bursting onto the scene over a decade ago. A superstar, and rightly considered the best player in the world at the moment.

Radamel Falcao

The Colombian wasn't able to impress at the World Cup through injury, but a big-money loan move to Manchester United means the former Porto and Atletico man can showcase his talent on a bigger stage than the French Ligue 1 with Monaco. Mendes has dealt with United plenty of times now, with Bebe, Nani, Carlos Quieroz and Anderson all represented by him.
