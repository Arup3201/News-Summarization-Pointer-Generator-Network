A Cambridge university lecturer has caused an outcry after footage emerged showing him calling homosexuality an 'inexplicable aberration' and saying gay people are 'so ignorant you don't even understand what your bodies are for'.

In a video that has gone viral, Tim Winter, 52, a theology lecturer and Director of Studies at Wolfson College, called homosexuality the 'ultimate inversion', and said homosexual acts were an 'extreme defiance of Allah'.

Today the public school-educated academic, a practising Sufi Muslim who also uses the name Sheikh Abdul-Hakim Murad, apologised for his remarks that were made 'at least 15 years ago' before he joined the university, and said his views had changed since.

'This is a form of extreme defiance of Allah': Mr Winter ranted against homosexuality for eight minutes in the clip, which he said dated back at least 15 years

The British academic faced fierce criticism over the views he expounded in what he says was a question and answer session following a talk he gave in America in the mid-1990s.

Charlie Bell, President of the CUSU 
LGBT+ group for lesbian, gay and transgender students, said: 'Remarks degrading LGBT+ people, 
relationships or sexual practices surely disgust any of us who are part 
of the decades-long struggle to see LGBT+ people as valued, equal 
citizens...

'We
 know that Mr Winter has asked for the video to be taken down; it 
remains for his college to decide whether these past remarks are 
incompatible with his current role in the college, especially if it has a
 pastoral nature, and we are currently in communication with them over 
this.'

Gareth Rhys, 23, a finalist studying History of Art at Magdalene College, said the 'hateful, anachronistic views' expressed in the video made him feel 'deeply uncomfortable'.

He added: 'I think he should be removed from his position as Director of Studies because his views could cloud his judgement when dealing with gay students and could even put gay people off from applying for his subject for fear of prejudice.

'If the views are out of context then he should explain that context.'

Tim Winter is a Director of Studies at Wolfson College, Cambridge, where he meets students regularly to check how they are

The divinity lecturer compared gay people to arsonists, saying just because you are born with a tendency doesn't mean it should be legalised

In the eight-minute rant which is 
believed to be taken from his DVD, Al-Ghazali On Disciplining The Soul, 
he referred to gay people, saying: 'You're an ignorant people.  Why ignorant?  Because you don't even understand what your bodies are for.

'How ignorant can you get?  Even the animals know.'

Mr Winter, who is rated number 50 on the Muslim 500
 list of the most influential Muslims in the world, discussed at length 
the Sharia's (Muslim law's) 'emphatic, unqualified condemnation and 
prohibition of all forms of homosexual behaviour'.

In the video, which was made when he was in his 30s, Mr Winter
 compared gay people to arsonists, arguing that arsonists have a genetic
 predisposition to be arsonists, but just because they are born with it 
does not mean arson should be made legal.

'That's
 no argument for legalising what they do,' he said.  'The claim that a 
human being is born with a particular tendency means that it should be 
legalised is neither here nor there.'

No holds barred: The chairman of Cambridge University's LGBT+ society said he was 'disgusted' by Mr Winter's remarks

He went on to compare gay people to smokers, affirming that practising homosexuality is more dangerous than smoking.

'There is a great war against cigarette smoking but there is no campaign at all against the vice of the people of Lut [ie people of Sodom, or homosexuals]', he said.

The lecturer also says that in the eyes of Islam, homosexuality was not a sin, but practising it was.

'Even in the case of those few individuals that do appear to have an incurable tendency towards this inexplicable aberration, if they do not act upon the tendency they are not sinning...

'Acting upon and gratifying the tendency is the sin.'

Today Mr Winter, who has apologised to the University and to the Faculty of Divinity, where he teaches, told 
MailOnline: 'The YouTube clip is at least 15 years old, and does not in 
any way represent my present views.

'I am happy to confirm that I 
certainly do not see homosexuals as an "inexplicable aberration". The 
other views expressed in it should not be taken as indicators of what I 
currently believe - we all have our youthful enthusiasms, and we all 
move on.'

He told The Tab the interview was recorded in America after a talk he had given there in the 1990s.

A Cambridge University spokesman said: 
'Mr Winter has apologised for these remarks, recorded nearly twenty 
years ago, and has emphasised that he no longer holds these views.'

The clip was taken down from YouTube last night at Mr Winter's request, but not before it had gone  viral.  It is still available to buy on DVD on Islam On Demand and iTunes.
