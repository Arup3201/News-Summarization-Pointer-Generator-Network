Rory McIlroy confessed to mixed emotions after pulling off an incredible victory in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth on Sunday.

It was the first triumph on European soil for the 25-year-old and followed a fabulous final-round 66 that saw him overcome a seven-shot final-day deficit to Thomas Bjorn.

McIlroy sprayed the champagne to mark his success but there were no wild celebrations later, and McIlroy admitted that was partly due to his split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki on the eve of the event.

'There are definitely mixed emotions and, given all that's gone on and starting seven shots behind, I'm sitting here with the trophy wondering how the hell it's happened,' he said.

'Somebody asked me how I feel and the truth is I don't exactly know. I mean, I'm thrilled I've won obviously but it's been a weird week.'

Asked to explain how he had managed to put his personal turmoil to one side and pull off the win, McIlroy added: 'When I got inside the ropes this week I used it like a release. I was on my own and doing what I do best, and that sort of gave me five hours of serenity.

'I was just focusing on the job in hand and trying to get the ball round in the lowest number of shots possible.'

That proved one shot lower than Irishman Shane Lowry with Englishman Luke Donald and Bjorn tied third.

Not
 only was it McIlroy's first victory in Europe but his first on the 
European Tour since November 2012, when he triumphed in the DP World 
Tour Championship in Dubai.

'It
 has been a long 18 months,' he said. 'I guess my win at the end of last
 year ended all the questions about a slump and my Nike equipment. Now 
this win has, hopefully, set me up for a great summer.

'I said earlier this year that the game was waiting for a player to take it by the scruff of the neck and, hopefully, this will prove a platform for that player to be me.'

McIlroy took the short trip back to Belfast last night for a quiet night in with his mum, Rosie.

'I haven't seen her for a few weeks so that will be nice,' said the Northern Irishman. 'After that I will be back on a plane for America and ready to compete in Jack Nicklaus's tournament in Ohio on Thursday.

'I really wanted to win before going into the second major of the season (the US Open from June 12-15) and I could not have asked for a better way to prepare.'
