Alan Pardew admits he is under growing pressure at Newcastle after facing fresh calls for his head.

Fed-up supporters have launched a website demanding Pardew is axed - sackpardew.com - in the wake of 85 per cent backing an online poll of more than 5,000 fans insisting it was time to go for the increasingly unpopular St James' Park boss.

Newcastle are without a Premier League win this term on the back of a disastrous second half of last season, and the 53-year-old admits a victory at Southampton on Saturday is needed to help to ease the scrutiny he is under. Pardew said: 'I'm afraid it's part and parcel of the Premier League.

'We've not won a game yet so the teams that haven't won a game, the pressure is on those particular managers. That's even more with me because of the back end of last year when we weren't good enough.

'But I think we're good enough this year and I think our results will reflect that. In the short term we've played well and have only been beaten by Manchester City this season - they've destroyed a couple of teams so we're in a good place in terms of where we are.'

Pardew insisted owner Mike Ashley was still fully committed to the club despite fresh reports the club's billionaire owner is looking to sell up.

The manager added: 'I've heard no suggestion from him or any signs from him about that. He's obviously given us money to spend this summer which we've hopefully spent well.'

Newcastle teenager Rolando Aarons has been denied the chance of a first Premier League start at St Mary's Stadium this weekend after suffering a hamstring injury that could keep the winger for a month.

Aarons has enjoyed a meteoric rise this season and had been set to replace Seim de Jong after it was confirmed a serious groin injury will keep Dutchman out until Christmas.

But after starring for England Under 20s in their 6-0 win over Romania in the wake of scoring his first Premier League goal in the 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace, the 18-year-old faces a frustrating spell on the sidelines. Pardew added: 'We're really disappointed because he was flying.

'It's another blow for us but we're now going to have to get him back into training in the next couple of weeks.'

Pardew has also been forced into a rethink over Cheick Tiote ahead of the Saints clash, despite the midfielder recovering from the calf strain that's kept him out of Newcastle's opening games.

The manager was unhappy discover Tiote played the entire 90 minutes in both Ivory Coast's two Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sierra Leone and Cameroon this week, contrary to a gentleman's agreement between club and country.

He added: 'I'm a little disappointed that after agreeing with their manager that he wouldn't play 90 minutes because he hasn't really trained for us, he did just that.'
