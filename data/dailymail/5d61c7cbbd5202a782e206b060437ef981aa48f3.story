Hundreds of empty iPad Mini boxes were discarded at the European Parliament, prompting fears that bureaucrats are frittering thousands of pounds worth of taxpayers' money.

More than 106 boxes were pictured in a corridor at the Brussels parliament last week – with a total cost of £for all the tablets.

West Midlands Ukip MEP James Carver posted a picture to his Twitter page, saying: 'Pile of IPAD empty boxes on corridor in EP Brussels yesterday - No doubt, taxpayer funded -Eurocrats can't be subtle.'

Speaking today he said: 'I walked past and I first thought it was piles of paper, but when I saw it was hundreds of iPad boxes I was appalled.

'It is an astonishing waste of taxpayers' money. I was absolutely flabbergasted that they thought it was necessary to spend more than £25,000 on tablets which are not needed for the job.

'I was headed off to a meeting and I just thought good heavens, I have to take a picture and show people this.

'Countries in the EU are in dire financial straits and this is being allowed to happen. It's a 'let them eat cake' attitude.

'This sort of needless indulgence has to stop. The Brussels parliament is already seen as a money pit and this sort of flagrant waste only serves to underline it.

'Thousands of pounds have been frittered away on luxury gadgets for staff who already work in a building stocked with computers.'

The iPad Minis would cost at least £250 each.

The TaxPayers' Alliance said these 'extravagant' purchases show how out of touch political elites and bureaucrats have become.

Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'This is yet another example of how little regard Brussels has for taxpayers' money. iPads are a premium product which come with a price tag to match.

'When hard-pressed families across the country, and indeed the continent, are struggling with their everyday bills, these extravagant purchases show how out of touch our political elites and bureaucrats have become.

'Taxpayers deserve better value for their money.'

The European Parliament was not available for a comment. 

Last month the EU spent £1.6million to fund refuse collections in Cuba while those in the UK are being cut.
