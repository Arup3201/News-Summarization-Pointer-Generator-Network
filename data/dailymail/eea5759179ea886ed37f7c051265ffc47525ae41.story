Michelle Obama arrived in China on Thursday for a weeklong visit that will steer clear of politics and instead focusing on education and community.

The First Lady arrived in Beijing today, accompanied by 
daughters Sasha and Malia as well as her mother Marian Robinson.

On Friday, she is to spend the day with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, something which diplomats hope will build bridges between the two countries.

Force of one: Although Mrs Obama will avoid politics and instead focus her trip on education, she is set to meet  the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping tomorrow

'I think this is a very good 
opportunity to improve the China-U.S. relations, as the first lady can 
represent the soft side of diplomacy,' said Wang Dong, a political 
scientist at Peking University's School of International Studies.

'Michelle
 Obama herself has been accomplished in areas such as women's rights, 
children issues and education, and I think members of the Chinese public
 are anticipating her visit with a positive attitude,' Wang said.

During her trip to China, Mrs Obama will visit several schools and universities in Beijing as well as hosting
 a roundtable on education and promoting exchange programmes.

By her side will be her two daughters, but also her 76-year-old mother Marian Robinson.

Mrs
 Robinson, the first live-in grandmother in the White House since the 
1950s, is the only living grandparent of Malia, 15, and Sasha 12.

Well dressed: Ahead of the trip, Mrs Obama's fashion sense has been compared with that of the Chinese First Lady, and she did not disappoint when she disembarked in Beijing

The girls were both in skater-style skirts, black tights and Sasha wore trendy black-laced shoes

She
 is a constant presence in Malia and Sasha’s daily lives, helping them 
with homework, taking them to and from school and caring for them when 
their parents are out of town.

White
 House officials hope that by accompanying her daughter and 
granddaughters, she will ‘resonate with the Chinese people,’ as it is common 
for grandparents help bring up children in the Asian powerhouse nation.

In China, and a majority
 of South-East Asian countries, families keep multi-generational 
households and grandparents are seen as secondary care providers.

‘I
 think they understand the significance as well of family and of three 
generations of family traveling together, which I think the Chinese will
 appreciate, and will appreciate the ties and the bonds that the Obama 
family have with one another across generations,’ the first lady's chief
 of staff Tina Tchen said.

‘This
 is a great opportunity for the Obama family to experience that, and I 
think for the Chinese to see that as well in an American family.’

The president himself, meanwhile, appears to be suffering from empty-nest syndrome as he addressed an audience at the White House.

‘Michelle and the girls are on their way to China, it's very lonely at home,’ President Obama said, according to NBC News.

Peng is a civilian member of the Chinese army and holds major general 
rank.

Philanthropic work: Peng has served as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS since 2011

Xi Jinping (centre) and Peng Liyuan arrive in Kuala Lumpur in October last year. Peng's presence is unusual insomuch as wives of Chinese leaders are rarely seen

Speaking ahead of a screening of Cesar
 Chavez, a film about the life of the farm labor activist, President 
Obama showed that even the most powerful man in the world can get 
confused by technology.

‘I
 cannot stay for the screening; somebody's going to get me the CD. Or 
whatever, I'm a little technologically challenged - the DVD!’

Mrs Obama's trip provides an opportunity for the U.S. President and Chinese 
President Xi to cultivate a personal relationship through their 
wives following their meeting in Sunnylands in California last year, 
Wang said.

'Such a personal 
relationship with mutual trust is crucial, as the China-U.S. 
relationship has entered a more challenging phrase,' Wang added.

Peng,
 Xi's wife, accompanied her husband on the Sunnylands visit but did not 
meet Mrs. Obama, who stayed in Washington.

Her absence left some Chinese
 grumbling and the visit allows the first lady to make up for it.

'I think this provides a natural reason to stay engaged' before Xi and Obama meet again, Wang said.

The trip also gives Peng unusual prominence in a Chinese official culture that usually keeps leaders' spouses in the background.

Peng, a popular folk singer, was better known than Xi before he became Communist Party leader and president.

'She has a good presence on television,' said Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

'This is a formidable soft power China can use for the world to see China is not a monolithic society.'

Earlier today it emerged that Michelle 
Obama will not take questions from reporters or give interviews during 
her tour of China, and members of the press corps who 
usually follows the first family everywhere can't travel with her 
entourage.

And although she 
will make a few speeches with reporters in the room, the picture is 
largely one of an expensive, taxpayer-funded tourism exercise for Mrs. 
Obama, her two daughters, and her mother – not the official trip the 
White House has projected.

White
 House press officials haven't comment on the record about whether a 
reported ban on question-and-answer interviews applies equally to 
American journalists and international reporters.

Limited information made available to MailOnline suggests that only two
 out of 22 scheduled events on the trip will afford journalists a chance
 to do any significant reporting.

The White House also indicated that the two 
events during the trip that are completely open to journalists will not see the first lady be interviewed or 
take questions, and they are marked 'space 
limited' on her itinerary.

'Throughout
 the week she will participate in open press and pooled events including
 speeches at two schools, questions from students online and forums 
including a CNN iReport,' a White House official told MailOnline
