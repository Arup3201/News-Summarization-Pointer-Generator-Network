Five policemen were killed and 12 more wounded when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive vest at the the entrance to a concert hall in Chechnya yesterday.

The suicide bomber was wearing a police uniform and presented police credentials as he tried to go through metal detectors set up outside the concert hall in Grozny, the capital.

When police moved to stop him, he detonated the explosives. No civilians were reported wounded.

Dead bodies of police officers who prevented a terrorist attack lie on the floor in Grozny, Chechnya, yesterday

The five policemen were killed when they went to check on an individual who was acting suspiciously

Despite two separatist wars in the 1990s and a festering Islamic insurgency, Chechnya has seen a period of relative calm under the rule of Moscow-backed Ramzan Kadyrov, and suicide bombings have been fewer in recent years.

The concert hall where the attack was launched was due to host festivities planned to celebrate Grozny's city day holiday, which is also Mr Kadyrov's birthday.

'Police officers who were manning metal detectors at the entrance of the concert hall noticed a suspicious young man,' a local police officer told RIA news agency.

'When the police officers decided to check the individual, the man blew himself up.'

The attacker was identified as Opti Mudarov, a 19-year-old resident of Grozny, BBC News reports. He reportedly disappeared two months ago, breaking contact with his family.

Following the Chechen separatist wars in 1994-96 and 1999-2000, an insurgency spread across the predominantly Muslim North Caucasus, fuelled by anger over corruption and alleged rights abuses.

Yesterday's attack was the first major act of violence since the death of insurgent leader Doku Umarov who was killed in a clampdown during Russia's hosting of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, on the western edge of the Caucasus Mountains.

Mr Kadyrov, who has been threatened personally by the insurgents, who call themselves the Caucasus Emirate, has vowed to wipe out the militants. But he has faced criticism from human rights groups for torture and disappearances of those suspected of being linked to the insurgency.

He calls the accusations an attempt to blacken his name.

The last suicide bombings in Russia took place late last year in Volgograd, a city north of the volatile Caucasus region. The last suicide bombing in Grozny was in 2012 and killed at least four soldiers.

In Kabardino-Balkaria, nearly 125 miles west of Chechnya, security officials also killed two militants on Sunday, Russian state TV said.
