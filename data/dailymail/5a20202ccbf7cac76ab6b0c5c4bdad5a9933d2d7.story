A husband and wife pleaded guilty to stuffing their three children into plastic storage boxes and making them stand on pins to 'punish' them yesterday.

Samantha, 26, and James Taylor, 29, of Steubenville, Ohio pleaded guilty to counts of child endangerment and unlawful restraint, according to WTOV9.

They subjected their three children aged 5, 6 and 8 to horrific torture when they believed they had misbehaved.

Torture: James Taylor, 29, and wife Samantha Taylor, 26, pleaded guilty to child endangerment and unlawful restraint. The boxes were only one form of torturous punishment used against the children

Taped in: This is one of the storage boxes used in the abuse of three children in Steubenville, Ohio. The three children 8, 5, 6 were stuffed in the boxes which were then taped shut

It included restraining the children before taping them into small storage boxes.

They were placed inside the boxes for 15-30 minutes with square holes cut out of the lids to expose the top part of their faces.

Water was also poured on the children while they were crammed in, struggling to breath.

They also had weights dropped on 
their toes and were forced to stand on their tiptoes in the corner of a 
room with pins placed under their feet when the parents believed they had misbehaved.Â 

They would then be given heavy 
weights to hold up in the air so when they finally gave way the pins 
would pierce through the soles of their feet.

Guilty: James and Samantha Taylor both made plea deals in Jefferson County yesterday, pictured. The 'box punishment' was just one way the parents tortured their three young children, according to the court

Indicted: Daniel McKenney (left) and Glenn Adams (right), the children's two uncles, pleaded guilty for failing to stop the abuse. Prosecutor Jeff Bruzzese says they face being put on probation

Location: The children, aged 5, 6 and 8, were crammed into the boxes as a punishment at the family home in Steubenville, Ohio, pictured

'You can see in one of the 
photographs, there is water in the bottom of the totes," said Jefferson 
County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Jeff Bruzzese.

'It was apparent 
that water was dumped on top of these children while they were inside 
and restrained in these totes.'

Talking about the other abuse Bruzzese told the local broadcaster it included: 'Having weights dropped on their 
feet.'

'It also included the children having to stand in a 
corner on their tiptoes with pins and needles placed under their feet 
while holding weights out in the air.

'I can't imagine that they would be
able to stay on their tiptoes for all that long, so if and when they 
were to fall, their feet would have to come down on top of these pins 
and needles.'

According to the court case the 
children's father was the main architect of their torture but their 
stepmother failed to stop the abuse.

'It was clear that these types of punishments were done at (Taylor's) direction and at his order," said Bruzzese.

'It certainly was repulsive that she allowed these things to go on,' Bruzzese added.

Following the plea deal, where both 
parents admitted two counts of child endangerment and one count of 
unlawful restraint, James Taylor will serve one year behind bars.

Samantha Taylor will serve two years of probation.

It was only when a family friend stumbled across the children sealed in boxes in June last year that the alarm was raised.

The unnamed witness visited the 
Oregon Avenue home and discovered the children. She immediately released
them and called the police.

The children's two uncles also pleaded guilty to failing to stop the abuse they witnessed.

Bruzzese said Glenn Adams and Daniel McKenney would be placed on probation for unlawful restraint.

The three children are now said to be living with relatives and doing well.
