Police in Maine are investigating a murder suicide after a man was shot dead by his former gay lover who then turned the gun on himself.

Matthew Rairdon, 22, was shot dead in the early hours of Saturday morning at his apartment in downtown Westbrook as he returned from a shift at a local hospital.

Patrick Milliner, 30, then turned the .40-caliber Glock pistol on himself. Their bodies were found several hours later by Rairdon's room mate.

According to Maine State Police Milliner, who recently moved to Maine from Colorado, had just purchased the weapon the night before.

Police have described the two men as former lovers whose relationship had recently ended.

Although authorities haven't pinpointed when the pair split up, the period after a breakup is considered the most dangerous, especially if one partner has access to or recently purchased a gun, Julia Colpitts, executive director of the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence, told Portland Press Herald.

The Mayor of Westbrook, Colleen Hilton, described the incident as ‘a senseless tragedy’ and said she had personally known the Rairdon family for many years.

Authorities haven't pinpointed when Rairdon, right, and Milliner, left, had volunteered together on the Equality Maine campaign in 2012 to secure same-sex rights in the state

The murder suicide occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning at Rairdon's apartment in downtown Westbrook as he returned from working a shift at a local hospital

She described Matthew Rairdon as ‘a great kid' and 'a tragic loss'.

Rairdon had recently started working as an emergency room nurse at Mercy Hospital in Portland, while Milliner was a new correctional guard at the Maine Correctional Facility in Windham.

According to Milliner’s Facebook page, the pair had volunteered together on the Equality Maine campaign, which in 2012 helped to secure same-sex marriage rights in the state.

On September 2 Milliner had written: ‘One of my favorite memories in Maine so far was watching family videos with his family today. Still smiling – with Matt Rairdon.’

The state medical examiner’s office was due to perform autopsies on both men on Sunday, and more details about the crime are expected to emerge this week.
