Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, the enlisted U.S. soldier who left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was later ransomed from an Islamist extremist network by the Obama administration for five Taliban leaders, was charged with desertion and 'misbehavior before the enemy' buy the U.S. Army on Wednesday.

But he won't face the death penalty if a military court martial finds him guilty of 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty.' The level of that charge the Pentagon levied on him carries a maximum of just a 5 year prison term.

The other charge, however, 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place,' could send him to a military prison for life.

The Uniform Code of Military Justice describes examples of that crime as running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.'

CHARGED: An Army officer announced the formal criminal complaint against Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl at Fort Bragg, N.C., on Wednesday

Bergdahl, a US Army sergeant who was swapped in 2014 for five high-value Taliban leaders, has been charged with desertion and will face a military court martial, according to reports on Wednesday

SOLDIER: Bergdahl was an Army private when he was captured, but the Pentagon restored his rank upon his release to what it would have been – sergeant – if he had remained on active duty, and paid him more than $200,000 in back wages

In addition to a potential life sentence, punishments for the crimes Bergdahl was charged with include a dishonorable discharge from the Army, a reduction in rank all the way down to 'E-1' – the lowest level of enlisted personnel – and forfeiture of all of his military pay. 

An Army spokesman said in a hastily scheduled press conference at Fort Bragg in North Carolina that the next step in the procedure would be an 'article 32' hearing at Fort Sam Houston in Texas.

That's where Bergdahl remains on active duty, and will remain unless he's convicted. 

An article 32 hearing is analogous to a grand jury in the civilian court system. Its purpose is determine if there is enough evidence for a formal court martial.

Bergdahl, 28, disappeared from his post in Paktika province, Afghanistan on June 30, 2009 after tellign comrades that he had grown cynical about America's mission there.

The Haqqani network, a Pakistan-based network of Islamists aligned with the Taliban regime, took him prisoner and held him for nearly five years.

A deal brokered by the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar brought him home, but at the cost of releasing the Taliban insurgents from the military prison complex at Guantanamo, Cuba. 

Two of them have recently said they are eager to rejoin the fight against the West when their Qatar-imposed year of restrictions and monitoring is over. 

A government official meanwhile told Fox News that three of the men have already tried to 're-engage' with their old networks, and one was 'trying to provide advice, council or inspiration' to his former terror network.

Bowe Bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice

'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty':

Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.' It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case

MAXIMUM SENTENCE: 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay 

'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place': 

Article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.'

MAXIMUM SENTENCE: life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay

The Pentagon was set to announce a decision in the case Wednesday afternoon at Fort Bragg, N.C., but the White House insisted it was in the dark.

'I'm not aware of any plans for them to do that,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during his daily press briefing, after Daily Mail Online asked him for comment on the looming Pentagon press conference.

'But this is a process that's being run by the United States Army,' Earnest added. 'So I'd direct you to the Pentagon for an answer.'

A Pentagon official confirmed the charges in advance of the announcement.

House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement after the Army's announcement that 'every American is innocent until proven guilty, and we all wanted to bring Sgt. Bergdahl home.'

'But my chief concern remains President Obama’s decision to release five hardened terrorists, with no guarantees that they won’t return to the battlefield. I believe it made Americans less safe.'

Bergdahl's case has seen a series of shifts in administration policy, but charging him with a potentially capital offense would represent a stunning 180-degree turn.

Last year after Bergdahl came home, National Security Adviser Susan Rice claimed he had served his country 'with honor and distinction.'

But in the days before his then-mysterious disappearance in 2009, he wrote an email to his parents spelling out his disillusioned thoughts. 

'The future is too good to waste on lies. And life is way too short to care for the damnation of others, as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong,' he wrote, according to Rolling Stone magazine.

'I have seen their ideas and I am ashamed to even be American.'

Bergdahl's father reportedly responded with an email whose subject line read: 'OBEY YOUR CONSCIENCE!'

The Fox News Channel reported in 2014 that Bergdahl's platoonmates found a note in his tent telling them that he had left to start a new life – and that he intended to renounce his citizenship.

PROOF OF LIFE: Bergdahl's captors released a video on July 19, 2009 showing him with his head shaven, and showing his military 'dog tag' ID to the camera

Gen. Mark Milley, the commanding officer at Fort Bragg, has been leading the inquest into the Bergdahl case. The U.S. Army's decision to send the desertion case to a court martial signals that military prosecutors believe they can prove Bergdahl never intended to return to his combat unit.

Desertion itself can carry a death sentence, but only in the most serious of cases. That penalty hasn't been levied on a U.S. servicemember since 1944.

The Pentagon has broad discretion and can charge soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen with desertion on a variety of different levels.

Bergdahl's attorney spoke to reporters in advance of the Pentagon's announcement.

The Washington Post reported that Eugene Fidell, Bergdahl's attorney, said his client was handed his 'charge sheet' Wednesday at Fort Bragg. 

President Barack Obama attracted scorn when the prisoner swap was announced, especially from Bergdahl's former platoonmates – who insisted he deserted them and their mission. 

One of them, Cody Full, told a congressional committee in June 2014 that Bergdahl could – and should – be court martialed on eight separate charges, including disobeying orders and 'misconduct' as a prisoner.

SWAP: The Army opened an investigation into Bergdahl's 'capture' almost immediately after his release, shown here in a still frame from a video of the prisoner exchange (Bergdahl is 3rd right, back to the camera)

TEMPORARY: Jubilant signs and American flags went up overnight in the Bergdahls' hometown of Hailey, Idaho – but were largely taken down as the circumstances of Bowe's capture made the news.

Most of the backlash against the president, however, came from Congress – which wasn't given 30 days' notice about the 'Taliban 5' being transferred out of Guantamo Bay. A federal law requires such notice.

The House of Representatives later approved a resolution condemning Obama for breaking the law, with 22 Democrats breaking ranks to agree. 

'By setting free five top Taliban commanders from U.S. custody, the Obama administration made Americans less safe,' Speaker John Boehner said then.

Obama defended his actions in a June 2014 joint press conference in Brussels, Belgium with British Prime Minister David Cameron, just a few days after Bergdahl was released into U.S. custody.

'I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents,' the president said then, 'and that the American people understand that this is somebody's child and that we don't condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back.'

'We had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated, and we were deeply concerned about [him],' Obama told reporters about Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. 'And we saw an opportunity and we seized it. And I make no apologies for that.'

Administration officials told senators that they were kept out of the loop on the hostage swap because the Taliban threatened to kill Bergdahl if information about the negotiations was leaked.

Separately, the parents of an Army lietenant who died while searching for Bergdahl months after he walked away from his platoon told Daily Mail Online that the Pentagon 'lied' to them about the circumstances of their son's death.

Second Lieutenant Darryn Andrews perished in September 2009, and his commanders first said he was blown up while hunting a Taliban commander. Once Bergdahl was released, they were told the truth.

'It's a big cover-up like Benghazi,' Andrews' father said three days after Bergdahl's release, 'just like everything Obama has done.'
