Emergency services were hit by a surge in 999 calls yesterday as the deadly smog tightened its grip on Britain.

Complaints about breathing problems rocketed and people were urged to avoid strenuous outdoor activity as the fumes enveloped many parts of the country.

David Cameron, who abandoned his regular morning jog, was criticised for dismissing the potent cocktail of toxic particles, factory pollution and dust from the Sahara as a 'naturally occurring weather phenomenon'.

Scientists said the health crisis was as much to do with his Government's failure to deal with poor air quality. As the pollution reached ten, the maximum on the official scale measuring air quality, for a second day:

London and the South-East were again among areas worst hit, with the London Ambulance Service reporting a 14 per cent rise in 999 calls related to breathing difficulties.

Ambulance services in the West Midlands and the East of England experienced a spike in emergency calls, while the smog also affected the North-West, Yorkshire and South Wales.

Nearly a third of asthmatics suffered an attack as a result of the pollution, a poll for Asthma UK found, while 84 per cent reported using their blue reliever inhaler more than usual.

Asthma UK chief executive Kay Boycott said the smog was having 'a significant impact on the health and quality of life' of asthmatics and they needed to take urgent action to stay safe.

She added: 'Asthma can be very serious, it takes the lives of three people every day so we want to do everything we can to help people minimise their risk of a potentially life threatening attack.'

Dr Sotiris Vardoulakis of Public Health England said: 'Some parts of the country have now recorded very high levels of air pollution and PHE is urging people in those areas to reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if they experience symptoms such as a cough or sore throat. Adults and children with lung problems, adults with heart problems, and older people, in areas where high levels are recorded should avoid strenuous physical activity.'

London Ambulance Service deputy medical director Fenella Wrigley said: 'More people are calling us with breathing difficulties, asthma and heart problems.'

She said the young and healthy are unlikely to suffer serious short-term effects from the pollution but anyone with sore eyes, a tickly cough or a dry throat should see their pharmacist or GP if symptoms persist. She warned the smog had made it a busy time for the service and urged people to call only in a genuine emergency.

Although the smog is forecast to begin to clear today as the wind picks up, experts say the NHS may remain under pressure as people suffer delayed symptoms brought on by inhaling the dust.

Mike McKevitt, head of patient services at the British Lung Foundation, said: 'It would be surprising if we didn't see an overall increase in the number of hospital admissions as a result of the pollution, certainly among people with respiratory condition such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is often a slight delay between exposure to pollutants and the onset of breathlessness, coughing and wheezing, so it is also possible that the ill effects of the pollution has yet to take hold in many people.'

Although the Saharan dust and fumes blown in from Europe are part of the problem, scientists insist pollution from UK cars and factories is a major factor.

Dr Helen Dacre, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, warned: 'Toxic gases, such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone, as well as fine dust particles all contribute to cause problems for people with heart, lung and breathing problems, such as asthma.'

The Prime Minister told BBC1's Breakfast: 'It is unpleasant, and you can feel it in the air.

'I didn't go for my morning run this morning. I chose to do some work instead. You can feel it.' However, Mr Cameron insisted: 'But it's a naturally occurring weather phenomenon. It sounds extraordinary, Saharan dust, but that is what it is.'

London mayor Boris Johnson, who has been criticised for failing to deal with London's poor air quality, told ITV News: 'I cycled this morning and it seemed perfectly fine to me.

'I think we need to keep a little bit of a sense of proportion.'

Critics said Mr Cameron's 'flippant remark' and Mr Johnson's comments demonstrated the Government's failure to get to grips with air pollution, which was linked to the premature deaths of more than 29,000 people in Britain last year, according to official figures.

Keith Taylor, Green MEP for South-East England, said Mr Cameron's remark was 'utterly disgraceful'. He said: 'In the last ten years nearly 300,000 people have died because of air pollution in the UK, that's the equivalent of a city the size of Newcastle.

'Yet the Prime Minister has the audacity to lay the entire blame for the smog on Saharan dust.'

Professor Ian Colbeck of the University of Essex, said air pollution 'is now the biggest single environmental health risk'.
