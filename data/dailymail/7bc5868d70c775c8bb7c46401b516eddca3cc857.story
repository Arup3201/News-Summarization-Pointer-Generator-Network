A young couple suspected of murdering their three-year-old daughter have been forced into hiding  after receiving death threats.

Richard Green, 22, and Natalie Critchley, 20, were arrested and questioned for up to four days by police after Lia Green died in mysterious circumstances from 'significant internal injuries caused by violence'.

It emerged today that the young couple - who were freed on bail on Monday - were in hiding after fears for their safety from vigilantes.

Under investigation: Richard Green, 22, and 20-year old Natalie Critchley - who are suspected of murdering their three year old daughter - have been forced into hiding after receiving death threats

They
insisted they were innocent amid claims Lia may have injured herself 
whilst toddling around a children’s playground the day before she died.

Green posted a mis-spelt message on 
his Facebook page saying: 'going off fb now as i said i aint descussed 
the case. dnt believe wt u hear cus it aint true.'

A friend responded: 'Hope ur ok Richard!!! Thinking of you x.' Another said: 'I believe you.'

Lia - described as a 'little Princess' -
was rushed to hospital from her home in Preston, Lancashire, after a 
999 call at 8am on Thursday from her parents saying she was 'feeling 
unwell'.

Tragic: Three-year-old Lia was rushed to hospital but pronounced dead on arrival

She died on arrival at Royal Preston Hospital from fatal internal injuries despite attempts by paramedics to save her.

Lia’s
grandfather Steve Rimmer, 47, said the couple who are now staying at a 
hotel 'just wanted to be left alone to grieve', but claimed they feared 
for their safety because they had received death threats online.

Mr
Rimmer said: 'They are going to have to live with this for the rest of 
their lives, and not because they have murdered anyone. It was a tragic 
accident.

'They understand what has happened to Lia is tragic, and they understand why they need to be questioned by police.

'But they would like it if people would give them the benefit of the doubt before they judge them.

'They are afraid that people are going to come looking for them and harm them.

'As far as they are concerned, all they are saying is "wait until you know all the facts because we are innocent".'

He added: 'They have received death 
threats which we have to take seriously, so they can’t go home. The 
family have seen these threats on Facebook.

'Under
their bail conditions we’ve had to find somewhere for them to stay 
without any children living there, which strikes out the whole family.

'They can’t stay at my home because 
everybody knows them. We’re arguing with the police and saying this is 
bang out of order. It is horrendous.

Investigation: A forensic officer removes evidence from the murder scene

'They have left them in limbo and are putting their two lives in danger. They can’t even mourn for Lia because they are still trapped in this battle.

'In the last three days I’ve had six 
hours sleep. That’s how much it’s screwing me up, but it’s nothing 
compared to what they are going through.

'Nothing
is adding up at the moment. Why would Lia be running around in a park 
if she was feeling so ill? There are so many things which don’t make 
sense.

Posing: This picture of Natalie Critchley is on the 20-year-old's Facebook page

Speaking out: Green posted a mis-spelt message on his Facebook page saying: 'going off fb now as i said i aint descussed the case. dnt believe wt u hear cus it aint true'

'I only saw Lia two weeks ago at a 
family christening. She was a normal healthy three year old girl - a 
lovely girl so full of life.

'It just seems so unreal at the moment and 
no-one can quite get their head around how this has happened.'

The couple will answer bail in Preston on October 16. Officers are also trawling through CCTV footage on cameras in the street and in public parks in the area.

Lancashire Police said: 'We are supporting the family at this time and we are assessing the potential threats within the local community to make sure it is safe for them.'

Upsetting: Floral tributes and a teddy bear are pictured outside the house

Tribute: A card and flowers from a wellwisher sit outside Lia's home in Preston

Det Chief Insp Stuart Dixon said: 'A team of 30 detectives is working on the case, carrying out house-to-house visits in the area and reviewing CCTV as we try to build up a picture of Lia’s family lifestyle in the days leading up to her death.'

'While there were no significant injuries on the outside of her body, there were significant internal injuries caused by violence.'
