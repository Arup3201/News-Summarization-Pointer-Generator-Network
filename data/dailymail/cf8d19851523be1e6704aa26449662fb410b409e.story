An NHS worker stole £650,000 from a cancer hospital’s drugs fund and blew it on her wedding and designer handbags.

Stacey Tipler, 32, siphoned off the cash while working in the accounts department of the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, transferring it into accounts controlled by a gang recruited by her fiancé, Scott Chaplin, 33.

The funds were then quickly withdrawn and split, with Tipler using her share to go shopping for Gucci handbags and pay for her nuptials, which were planned for May 2013.

She also splashed out on a model helicopter and cleared £30,000 debts, Southwark Crown Court heard.

But she was arrested a year before her big day, after suspicious staff at suppliers Alliance Healthcare notified the NHS that the company had received two remittance slips with no accompanying payment. Investigators have only been able to claw back around half of the stolen cash.

Tipler and Chaplin, of Carshalton, Surrey, face jail after being found guilty of conspiracy to defraud after a two-week trial. They will be sentenced at a later date.

Chaplin was also found guilty of money laundering by the jury.

Tipler sobbed as Judge Anthony Leonard QC warned her: ‘I appreciate there are children involved in this case but you must also appreciate what the likely sentence will be.’ Co-defendants Aiden Butcher, 38, Steven Rico, 22 and Danielle Flynn, 35, were cleared of money laundering.

Clinton Woolery, 35, Thomas Quinlan, 26, William Flynn, 37, Russell Baker, 32, Roy Harriott, 26, and Adrian Horan, 42, had earlier admitted money laundering.

Horan also admitted his part in the conspiracy to defraud alongside Tipler and Chaplin.

Stephen Hopper, prosecuting, said: 
‘The defendants spent money that should have gone on cancer drugs on 
model helicopters and Gucci.

‘This
 is a very straightforward case. Stacey Tipler exploited her access to 
the Trust’s computerised payment system, Agressos, in order to divert 
funds.

‘She achieved this 
simply by removing the bank details on the Agressos system for a number 
of the Trust’s suppliers and replacing those details, temporarily, with 
the bank account details of one of the other defendants.

‘In
 this way a total of £642,827.98 was diverted to six different accounts 
controlled by people known either to her or her partner.’
