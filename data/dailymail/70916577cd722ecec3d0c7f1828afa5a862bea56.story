America last night said it had the first proof that sarin gas was used by Syria in an attack that killed more than 1,400 civilians.

Secretary of State John Kerry claimed samples of hair and blood provided to the US by people in Damascus had ‘tested positive’ for the nerve agent.

He said that President Bashar Assad has now ‘joined the list of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein’ in deploying chemical weapons against his population. He added that the case for a military attack was getting ‘stronger by the day’ – which follows the leak of a report by French spies that Assad has stockpiled more than 1,000 tonnes of poison gas including sarin.

Responsibility: French agents say Assad's regime is behind the nerve gas attack in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus on August 21

On Saturday, President Barack Obama 
said there would be no reprisals until Congress voted on military action
 after its summer break on September 9.

In theory, as commander-in-chief of US forces, he could ignore any vote that refuses to authorise missile strikes.

Opposition
 politicians warned the president might struggle to secure backing. Even
 Republican congressman Peter King, who supports military action against
 Assad, said: ‘I think it is going to be difficult’. But bullish Mr 
Kerry said of a Congress vote: ‘We are not going to lose.’

Military action: Chancellor George Osborne said there would be no fresh attempt to persuade MPs to go to war with Syria

Speaking
 of the evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria, he added: ‘I can 
share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us 
through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first 
responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin.’

It
 was the first time Washington has pinpointed the chemical used in the 
attack on Ghouta, a rebel-held area of the Syrian capital on August 21.

Mr Kerry added: ‘So this case is building and this case will build.’

Assad
 remained defiant last night in the face of possible military strikes, 
insisting Syria was ‘capable of confronting any external aggression’.

The
 tyrant said the threat of a bombardment would not discourage the regime
 from its ‘principles’ of crushing the rebels, who he described as 
‘terrorists’.

Syrian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad mocked President Obama’s decision to 
consult Congress as showing ‘hesitation and confusion’. Yesterday it 
emerged that details of the huge arsenal of chemical weapons stockpiled 
by Syria have been unearthed by French spies.

Assad has amassed more than 1,000 tonnes of poison gas including sarin and VX, the most toxic nerve agent ever created.

A
 leaked intelligence report said the tyrant possessed missiles capable 
of firing the substances 300 miles – within range of British military 
bases in Cyprus.

Secret 
service chiefs in Paris also blamed the Syrian government for the 
massacre, which the US claims killed 1,429 civilians including 426 
children.

Assad’s henchmen 
fired projectiles containing sarin into a rebel-held suburb simply to 
‘cause terror’, they concluded. The four-page briefing paper was 
compiled by agents working for the Direction Generale de la Securité 
Exterieure, the French equivalent of MI6 and the Direction du 
Renseignement Militaire, the military intelligence corps.

The
 memo was sent to President François Hollande, who has vowed to join 
military action to punish ‘those who took the heinous decision to gas 
innocents’.

Mr Hollande is due to publish the document this week in a bid to convince the French public to back missile strikes.

He
 came under fresh pressure yesterday to consult the French parliament 
about taking military action, following the example of Mr Obama.

The leaked intelligence reports disclosed that Assad had accumulated one of the world’s biggest chemical arsenals.

Stockpiles
 include Yperite, a substance similar to mustard gas used in the First 
World War, the tasteless and odourless nerve agent odourless VX and 
hundreds of tonnes of sarin gas.

Escalation: President Obama said Saturday he will ask the U.S. Congress to authorise military action against Syria

The
 dictator also has an arsenal of bombs capable of dropping up to 300 
litres of sarin, as well as Scud, Grad and SS21 missiles with a range of
 310 miles and artillery shells which could fire poison gas 30 miles. A 
French intelligence source said: ‘We have had the Syrian chemical 
weapons in our sights for more than 25 years.’

The
 report said Syria used a series of fake companies to buy chemicals, 
supposedly for legitimate purposes, which it then used as weapons.

French
 intelligence agents said poison gas canisters were fired from Grad 
rockets, followed by a huge artillery barrage in a bid to destroy 
evidence of chemicals.

Meanwhile,
 UN weapons inspectors were yesterday preparing to brief 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon following a four-day investigation of the 
attack.

They left Syria for 
the Netherlands with their evidence early on Saturday, which will be 
examined by the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons in 
The Hague. Samples are thought to include soil, swabs from munitions, 
blood and hair from the victims and possibly even flesh from dead 
bodies.

It could be a fortnight before the final report is released.
