As Ibiza host their closing parties this weekend, hot young design duo Felder Felder are already raising a glass to next season.

The German sister design act unveiled a bohemian inspired range of fun, easy partywear that wouldn't look out of place on Pacha's dancefloor come next summer.

Taking iconic German model Veruschka von Lehndorff as their muse, the unapologetically Bohemian aesthetic was updated for SS15 with a graceful edge via enviable kaftans, romantic kimono shawls and soft silk blouses.

Felder Felder gave a nod to the Ibiza party trend in their SS15 collection and kitted out models in Jessie Western boots

'Our woman is distinctive,' Daniela and Annette said ahead of the show. 'She has a vintage treasure trove wardrobe and those effortless enviable beach pieces, that transit, through midnight, to dawn.' And the Felder Felder woman sure caught the attention of front rowers Nina Nesbitt, Mary Charteris and Laura Whitmore thanks to her insouciant rock style.

Turquoise hot pants, print drop hem shift dresses and metallic cowboy boots conveyed the urban hippy woman beloved by the fun-loving designers.

Strong energetic prints in aqua (tipped to be a hot colour for SS15) and Sicilian lemon adorned shorts, maxis and kimonos.

The collection featured a lot of bold turquoise which is tipped to be THE colour for SS15

The catwalk featured many cow boy boots and fringed items giving a nod to a western vibe

Inspired by the freedom of the Sixties, the show closed with a nod to Peace One Day, an organisation that aligns with the designers' hope for peace ethos; oh so hippy.

'We have always been strongly attracted to the powerful message of peace, represented through eras like the Sixties,' said Annette. 'It's a feeling we continually tap into, especially at times of unrest, like now.'

The beauty look, masterminded by Michaela Alleyson, Creative Director at Lord & Berry, was fresh, fun and wearable - just like the clothes.

'It’s a celebration of colour that completely translates to an everyday face’, she said backstage.

Taking inspiration from the rock ‘n’ roll boho vibe of the collection, Michaela created a subtly highlighted face using Lord & Berry Luminizer Stick that screamed 'my days are spent roaming and writhing in the sun'.

Eyes, which were the main event - sexy, smouldering but fresh with the addition of an accent colour under the eye - were a nod to the key colour palette within the collection; one to watch come next season.

Hair was coiffed to perfection by Armin Morbach, Global Ambassador for Schwarzkopf, who created a young, fresh take of the iconic Brigitte Bardot look. Hair was gently curled from the middle partings to create loose waves and frame the face by resting it in front of the shoulders.

'Our girl is the one who moves between martinis downtown and rose on the sand dunes with consummate ease, said the siblings.

‘She’s a charismatic woman who is at ease with herself and the world. Age doesn’t matter. A Felder Felder woman is young at heart and she is a little wild too.’

Felder Felder show was supported by SkinDesign London, a sister partnership working in the beauty world, packed with active serums and cremes, akin to the sister fashion partnership.
