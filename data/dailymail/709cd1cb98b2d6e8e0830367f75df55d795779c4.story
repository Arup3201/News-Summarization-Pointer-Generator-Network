Two men escaped with their lives when their car flipped in the air and hit a house before being skewered by a tree.

The Toyota Starlet lost control at the road's central reservation and flew onto the grass verge.

Three ambulances were called to break the driver and passenger from the wreckage at 2.40am today in a quiet street in Crawley, West Sussex.
