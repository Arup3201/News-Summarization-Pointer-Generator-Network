Anderson Cooper shocked viewers on Thursday night by discussing his mother and oral sex in one outrageous anecdote.

The CNN anchor was hosting a 'review of the year' on his 360 show when he (over) shared that his mother, the 89-year-old heiress Gloria Vanderbilt, once called a former lover 'the Nijinsky of cunnilingus' in her memoir - which she had asked him to proofread.

The shocking tale was in response to contributor Dan Savage's remark that his favorite 
event of the year had been disgraced Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's bizarre 
behavior - including comments about his wife and oral sex.

On the subject of Ford, Savage quipped: 'I love a good cunnilingus joke on the evening news.'

Amid peals of laughter from the presenters, Cooper shared his family memory of his octegenarian mother.

Cooper divulged: 'My mom once wrote a romance memoir about men she had dated â€“ and I use that term loosely â€“ and she described one guy she was currently dating - my mom was 85 at the time - as the Nijinsky of cunnilingus. And she made me proofread the book.'

His guests appeared stunned into nervous laughter before Cooper added: 'I said ''mom, I don't know much about modern dance''...'

'Or cunnilingus,' Savage joked. The discussion fortunately wrapped up there.

The televised conversation prompted scathing criticism of Cooper on Twitter. Joe Newby tweeted: 'A new low in journalism from Anderson Cooper and CNN..'

Robert Whitemore wrote: 'INDECENT: THIS IS CNN: Anderson Cooper discusses mother's 'cunnilingus' on air.'

toddstarnes added: 'Why didn't CNN put Anderson Cooper on "indefinite hiatus"?' referring to MSNBC presenter Martin Bashir's resignation following comments about defecating in Sarah Palin's mouth.

Gloria Vanderbilt, who belongs to the fabulously wealthy Vanderbilt dynasty, was a society beauty in her heyday who had wild romances. She had four husbands, her last being the author Wyatt Emory Cooper, Anderson's father.
