A set of quintuplets from Humble, Texas who barely survived birth celebrated Halloween at the hospital that saved all five of their fragile lives.

Matilde, Aaron, Priscilla, Isaac and Joel Real-Mayorga, two, played among the baby pumpkins at Houston’s Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital during an event for children who have been cared for at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

Mother, Veronica Real-Mayorga, made headlines in 2010 when her two baby girls and three boys were born at just one day shy of 30 weeks weighing close to nothing.

Between them they ranged in weight from 2.5lbs to nearly 4lbs and though these numbers were considered healthy, the chances of losing one or more remained high as is common with multiple births.

They're all so precious,’ their mother told the Houston Chronicle at the time. ‘To expect smaller babies and then have them this size makes me feel truly blessed.’

Veronica Real-Mayorga had been on fertility drugs struggling to conceive a second child but did not do artificial insemination.

Advised to remove three of the embryos by doctors for safety precautions, she refused telling them: 'Any reduction would have to be done by God.’

Now a proud mother of the quintuplets and her elder son, she joined parents of other multiple babies on Saturday to celebrate the hospital, their health and Halloween.

The festivities were hosted on Saturday at the Houston Zoo where 300 families of twins and triplets gathered with their tiny tots many of whom were dressed for the occasion in cute costumes.

Among them were Mom Melissa Yemma, a nurse at the NICU, and her 7-month-old twin girls, Amanda and Alyssa, who stayed in the unit when they were born.

Amanda and Alyssa wore sweet flower suits for the bid day.

Triplets Alyssa, Brandon and Cassandra Cherry, 22 months, were matching in elephant outifts while competing for best dressed, Vera Grace, Lindy Ann and Genevieve Katherine Davis, 7 months, went as tomatoes and carrots.

For many intensive unit nurses it was the first time they had seen the children since caring for them in the weeks following their birth.
