Parts of Britain are to be lashed by torrential downpours this weekend as almost half a month's worth of rain is expected to fall in just one day.

The Met Office has given an severe weather warning for tomorrow and Saturday in the south of England, where some areas are to expect more than an inch and a half of rain.

Forecasters predicted that 1.57ins of rain could fall in southern counties including Essex, Hertfordshire, Devon, Somerset, Sussex and London - just short of half the average expected rainfall for November, which is 3.46ins.

Downpours: This forecast shows the heavy rain in the south of England, expected to fall mostly on Friday

Dusk: The sun sets last night over the Albert Bridge in west London. There have been warnings of heavy rain in the area for tomorrow

Weather experts also warned of small-scale flooding and disruption to transport services.

Helen Chivers, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'We've put out a warning for southern England, particularly towards the south coastal counties - from Devon eastwards across those southern counties of England.

'We're talking about 0.6ins to 1.2ins quite widely, with as much as 1.6inches in some places - though we wouldn't expect this to be widespread.'

The torrents, which have the potential to bring with them gales of up to 60mph in coastal areas, could make for choppy conditions on the English channel.

Minor flood warnings have also been issued by the Environment Agency in light of the expected rain.

A spokesman said: 'There is a medium likelihood of river and surface water flooding in parts of south and southeast England on Friday.

'Typical disruption could include localised minor flooding of land and roads and also localised travel disruption.'

In contrast to the downfall to come, the weather today will be only slightly unsettled across the country, with a mixture of rain and sun.

A Met Office forecast said: 'Today, in the southeast corner of England we've got some fairly patchy rain, which will gradually clear in the course of the day,. taking until mid-afternoon to clear in the very far southeast.

'To the northwest of Scotland in particular there are blustery showers, with the potential for thunderstorms.

'In the rest of England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are sunny spells with some blustery showers.

'Into tomorrow we start to see this weather system pushing up into the south, which we have the alert for. That will probably give rainfall across a good portion of England and Wales, but it's really the southern counties that are expected to bear the brunt of the heavier rain.

'To the north of that, still blustery showers to northwest Scotland, but northern Ireland, southern Scotland and north-west England should see a fairly decent day.

'And then into the weekend the system that's bringing tomorrow's rainfall moves away out into the North Sea, but we have another one pushing in from the West for Saturday.

'It's looking like a decent start for Saturday in much of the UK, and Eastern areas will hold on to fine weather for most of daylight hours.

'But there will be some wet and windy weather from the west on Saturday - probably in showers rather than persistent rain. Expect quite windy conditions in the west, and probably the south-west.

The continued wetness will come as an unwelcome follow-up to St Jude's storm earlier this week, which tore a trail of destruction across the country which left as many as five people dead, and thousands of homes without power.

Some homes in the south and south-east of England - which can expect the majority of the weekend's wet weather - are still without power in the aftermath of the storm, which left almost a quarter of a million homes cut off.

According to UK Power Networks, which maintains power supplies in the south and south-east of England, this morning all but 4,000 homes have been reconnected.

Around 1,000 properties in Essex, 2,000 in Suffolk, and a several hundred in other eastern counties are yet to have their electricity restored.
