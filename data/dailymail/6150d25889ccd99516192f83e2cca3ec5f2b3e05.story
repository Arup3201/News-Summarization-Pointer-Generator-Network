Family liaison officer: Jeffrey Davies, 42, was jailed for three years at Swansea Crown Court in August 2013 for taking advantage of the women

Two policemen have been sacked for mocking women who made sexual complaints against another officer.

The detectives failed to investigate complaints against their colleague Detective Constable Jeffrey Davies, 42, and instead used ‘repulsive language and poked fun’ at his victims.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission was called in after South Wales Police family liaison officer Davies was later jailed for three years for taking advantage of the women, who were victims of domestic abuse.

Both women complained about Davies, but the IPCC found his senior officers ignored this.

Instead they made ‘lewd’ and ‘sexual’ remarks about them in official emails - and even made up an office quiz based on their complaints. One officer ‘poked fun’ at a woman allegedly flashed at by Davies.

Detective Inspector Phillip Camm and Detective Sergeant Richard Jones were both found guilty of gross misconduct after five-day disciplinary hearing. The force has sacked both of them.

IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: ‘The women were not treated as victims of a sexual offence and their allegations were not investigated effectively.

‘The investigation also revealed a CID unit pervaded with what could be described as a canteen culture where inappropriate comments and behaviour were viewed as harmless banter.

‘The language demonstrated in emails and documents was, in fact, grossly unprofessional, offensive and demonstrated a lack of respect for the women complaining.

‘I read with a sense of repulsion the sexual content of comments made by Detective Sergeant Jones, both in his emails and in the two documents found on his computer.’

She added: ‘The allegations made against Jeffrey Davies were extremely serious and should have been treated that way.

‘They were vulnerable women who had turned to the police for help and had found themselves subjected to an appalling abuse of trust.

‘Their dreadful experience was then further compounded by the inactions of Jeffrey Davies’s supervisors who failed to deal properly with the criminal allegations against him.’

Jones deleted offensive emails when he discovered the IPCC were investigating.

And Camm lied to the IPCC when he was being interviewed about the handling of the allegations made by two complainants, known only as Woman A and Woman B.

Det Sgt Jones was Davies’s line manager and Det Insp Camm his supervisor at Merthyr Tydfil police station in South Wales.

Unimpressed: Independent Police Complaints Commission commissioner Jan Williams said the women's allegations 'were not investigated effectively'

The IPCC investigation discovered a 
‘canteen culture’ in the CID unit where officers joked about victims of 
the sexual assaults in 2011.

Chief Constable of South Wales Police Peter 
Vaughan said: ‘From myself to our front-line officers of South Wales 
Police are shocked and feel deeply let down by the behaviour of these 
officers.

‘Let us be in no 
doubt, we owe the women affected a sincere apology as the conduct of 
these officers fell well short of the standards I expect from South 
Wales Police.

‘As part of 
the investigation into their conduct a number of offensive and 
inappropriate emails and documents came to light which were prepared by 
Sergeant Jones and seen by Inspector Camm, who failed to challenge them.

‘I
 have to make it clear that this is behaviour I simply don’t recognise 
within South Wales Police. We have examined thousands of emails to see 
if such behaviour was more common.

‘Quite
 simply it is not and evidently, the vast majority of our 5,000 officers
 and staff know that there is absolutely no place for lewd and offensive
 communication and it will not be tolerated.

‘Everyone
 throughout South Wales Police knows the values and standards which are 
expected from them, we train them in these standards and on promotion.

‘I tell every manager that they have an absolute duty to challenge inappropriate behaviour and conduct.

‘Sergeant
 Jones and Inspector Camm failed to act in the professional manner that I
 expect of my officers. Their dismissals show that we will always be 
robust when it comes to staff misconduct.

‘At the same time, every year our front-line staff and specialist teams support hundreds of victims of sexual offences.

‘Leaders across the force are ensuring that we do our very best to protect vulnerable people and respond to their needs.’

Camm failed to refer the complaint of indecent exposure by ‘Woman B’ to the professional standards department and did not treat her as a victim of a sexual offence.

He was also found guilty of failing to carry out an effective investigation and treated the allegation as a malicious complaint.

Det Sgt Jones failed to refer ‘Woman A’s’ complaint of indecent assault to the professional standards department.

The IPCC investigation found the women’s allegations were not reported to the professional standards department of South Wales Police.

Commissioner Williams said they were ‘littered with lewd language’ and showed a total lack of empathy and respect for a victim who had shown ‘real courage’ to report an allegation of indecent exposure against a police officer.

She said: ‘He treated her complaint as sport, to be used as part of a quiz with colleagues outside work. This was outrageous and demonstrates the contempt in which the woman and her allegation was held.

‘Detective Sergeant Jones then tried to hide the evidence of his behaviour by deleting documents from his computer when he became aware of our investigation.

‘Inspector Camm failed to challenge his team’s behaviour and lied to the IPCC during an interview. It is only right that these officers have been dismissed.

‘Their failure to challenge inappropriate behaviour strikes at the heart of confidence in policing and tarnishes the good work done by officers every day.’

The IPCC met with Woman A and Woman B last week to share the findings of the report with them and explained the officers had been sacked.

Commissioner Williams said: ‘It is vitally important that other officers are confident that they will be supported if they challenge inappropriate behaviour.

‘Victims of crime must also feel that they can have confidence to speak to an officer, and be treated with dignity and respect.’

Davies was jailed for three years at Swansea Crown Court in August 2013 after being convicted of two counts of sexual assault against two women he was meant to be looking after.

He was cleared of a further offence of exposure against Woman B.
