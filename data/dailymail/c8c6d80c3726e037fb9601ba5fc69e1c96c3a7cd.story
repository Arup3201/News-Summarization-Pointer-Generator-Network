A double-decker passenger bus flipped onto its side early Tuesday on a highway near Indianapolis after apparently swerving to avoid a minor crash, badly injuring one person and hurting more than a dozen others, officials said.

The bus carrying between 50 and 60 people crashed about 4:30am on Interstate 65 when its driver apparently tried to avoid the accident that had occurred about 10 minutes earlier, state police sergeant Shawn O'Keefe said.

'The driver apparently didn't see it because of the rain or something and swerved to avoid it,' O'Keefe said.
