Norwegian-Somali Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow sits on a rock during a school outing in Larvik, Norway. The picture was taken six years before the mall shootings he is thought to have taken part in

Suspected Kenyan mall terrorist Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow has been revealed as a Chelsea fan as pictures his life begin to emerge.

The
 Somali-born 23-year-old, who lived in Norway, was identified by a 
neighbour two days ago who saw CCTV images of him carrying out the 
atrocity.

The report is now being investigated along with 
suggestions the Dhuhulow left his home in Larvik, 75 miles south of 
Oslo, for Somalia in 2009 where he was radicalised by the militant 
group, al-Shabab.

Dhuhulow is believed to have links to Mohamed 
Abdikadir Mohamed, known as Ikrima, who is regarded as one of the most 
dangerous commanders in the Somali terror group.

Former neighbour Morten Henriksen told BBC's Newsnight that one of the attackers on the video clip, in a black shirt or jacket, 
could be Dhuhulow, whom he described to the programme as 'pretty 
extreme'.

In total at least 67 people died in the September siege and it remains unclear how many militants were involved.

A former classmate of Dhuhulow's at Thor Heyerdahl High School said she was shocked when she found out he was a suspect in the Nairobi attack.

'The video I saw looks a lot like him. But it's difficult to see,' said the former classmate, who didn't want her name to be used.

'He was a quiet guy,' she said. 'He was very committed to his religion, but not extreme. He brought a prayer mat to school.'

investigated over the attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre last 
month - a relative said he could be the one dressed in a black shirt or

Larvik is a coastal town of about 
40,000, tucked in between the woods and the sea, surrounded by 
agricultural land and close to the mountains.

Community leader Mohamed Hassan said that Dhuhulow, as a boy, would listen to his elders in the mosque and be respectful.

Yesterday it was revealed that two charred bodies pulled from the building in 
Nairobi 'highly likely' to be attackers, a Kenyan MP told the BBC.

Ndung'u
 Gethenji, chairman of the parliamentary committee investigating the 
attack, also said the body of a Kenyan soldier had been recovered.

Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed, known as 
Ikrima in Kenya, is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in 
the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab and is believed to have spent some 
time in Norway.

He is thought to have been a target of a SEAL raid earlier this month, although he managed to escape.

Last
 week, Norway's intelligence agency, the PST, said it had sent officers 
to Kenya to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen was involved in the 
attack on the Nairobi mall.

During the week chilling footage emerged of the moment a terrorist mercilessly gunned down a shopper during the attack.

Surveillance video from
 a supermarket in the shopping centre shows the moment 
terrified men, women and children ran for their lives from the 
attackers.

The chilling video clips show just the first day of the bloody massacre.

In
 one a terrorist is shown shooting a man who desperately tries to crawl 
away before the merciless killer returns and shoots him again.

In
 another surveillance video the British four-year-old who famously told 
one of the terrorists that he was a 'very bad man' can be seen with his 
mother and six-year-old sister.

The Somali Islamic group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the assault and said it was in retaliation for Kenya sending troops into neighboring Somalia.

The killers, who were dressed in Western clothes, ordered all Muslims to leave, before carrying out rudimentary tests to see if hostages could recite the Koran and name the mother of the Prophet Mohammed.

Witnesses told how terrorists with faces hidden by Islamic scarves stormed the building, tossing grenades and spraying shoppers with AK-47s.

At one point Kenyan authorities said a woman might have been involved in the attack, prompting speculation that British terrorist suspect Samantha Lewthwaite - who was married to July 7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay - might have had some connection with the attack.

Dubbed the 'White Widow', Lewthwaite is known to be in East Africa and is wanted over alleged links to a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the country's coastal resorts. Interpol issued a notice asking for help in capturing the 29-year-old fugitive over the 2011 plot.
