This is the moment a mother arrived at her son’s school to find the distressed five-year-old with his hands tied behind his back - after 'acting up'.

Alicia Cabrel used a mobile phone to take a video of her upset son Derick Marte restrained with Velcro straps and screaming at the PS 107 school in New York.

She was told her child, who has ADHD, had become agitated when his gym session had come to an end and did not want to return to class.

Video shows how five-year-old Derick Marte (pictured), who has ADHD, was restrained with Velcro straps by school safety agents after an outburst at his Bronx School

The video shows the child sitting on a chair with his hands behind his back and calling out.

Ms Cabrel said she received a call during the day to say that there had been an outburst and that school officials had said they would call again if they needed her to come in.

About 25 minutes later she got another call, she told abc7 News.

But in the meantime her son was restrained with Velcro straps, something school safety agents are permitted to do in certain circumstances. He had been restrained for around 15 minutes when his mother arrived, abc7 News reports.

The New York Police Department, which oversees the agents, said its officers reported that the youngster tried to bite one of the workers, had been lashing out and throwing objects and that he had become a danger to himself and others.

But Ms Cabrel claims the Bronx school mishandled the situation and has hired an attorney in the hope the case will bring about changes in protocol.

She questioned why she was not called earlier to come and calm her son. A psychologist has reportedly recommended Derick should now be home-schooled.

She told abc7 News: ‘Nobody was injured. Usually when he gets his tantrums, I live across the street from the school. I can get there in less then five minutes. Why didn't you call me 30 minutes before he got to that point?

‘He wakes up in the middle of the night, scared, “Mommy, I don't want to go to school".'

Her attorney John O’Halloran told the broadcaster: ‘There's got to be a better way. If that's the system, we need to change that system to make it more friendly to the family and the parents.’

Abc7 News said the school principal has yet to respond to requests for a comment.
