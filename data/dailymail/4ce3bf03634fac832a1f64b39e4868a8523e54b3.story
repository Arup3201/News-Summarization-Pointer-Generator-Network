A 12-year-old girl is dead after a stray bullet struck her in the head just after 8.30 p.m. Saturday night while she was riding a scooter in Paterson, New Jersey

Genesis Rincon was originally brain dead as a result of the bullet striking her temple, but she passed away Sunday after succumbing to her injuries late in the afternoon.

The innocent young girl had left a family gathering with two friends who were unharmed in the crossfire. Police believe the shooting may have been in retaliation for one earlier in the night.

Awful: Genesis Rincon, 12-years-old, was shot in the head while riding her scooter

Rincon was at a family gathering Saturday night when she, another girl and a boy left to go to a nearby store, but they turned back after discovering it was closed.

They trio was passing the scooter back and forth about a block from the get together when the shots rang out, police said. Rincon immediately collapsed and lying unresponsive on the ground.

Police do not believe she was the intended target, but have not publicly disclosed much else about the incident.

The shooting happened in front of Melvin Simpson's home.

'I am very much upset, especially right here,' he told WABC. 'I'm very much upset about it.'

Where it happened: Rincon was shot dead on this stretch of sidewalk

Simpson called Rincon a 'nice young girl' and said 'it hurts... it could be my kids.'

Alexis Rincon wrote a painful goodbye to her cousin on Facebook.

'My life my soul my everything I love her. I don't know what type of animal would do something to her. She was a loving person she knows that we all love her.'

Further details on the shooting, including what type of weapon was used and whether other people may have been involved, were not disclosed Sunday.

Authorities said the girl's family was making arrangements to donate her organs.

No clear motive: Police do not believe Rincon was the target, but have said the shooting may be in retaliation for another incident earlier that evening

Authorities are also trying to determine if the shooting is connected to one that happened early Saturday about a block away from where Rincon was struck.

In that shooting, a 26-year-old man was wounded in the leg and underwent surgery. He remained hospitalized Sunday in stable condition.

A $2,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest in the girl's slaying.
