While die-hard One Direction fans are in mourning after Zayn Malik's after his shock exit from the band, others are taking to social media to mock the news - and it's hilarious.

Trav Roebuck, the producer of Hamish and Andy's radio show, has tweeted a screen grab of his comical search on SEEK looking for listings for a new band member for One Direction.

'Dear SEEK jobs - I feel there's a potential viral marketing opportunity here. Love Trav,' his tweet read along with an image of his search for 'One Direction band member.'

The cheeky Seek ad follows Zayn Malik's shock exit from the pop group

Trav Roebuck tweeted SEEK after a failed search for advertisements to be One Direction's next band member

SEEK's humorous response read 'Dear Trav, we only allow quality jobs on site.. we've got 'Styles', you see ;)'

Perhaps the most hilarious part was SEEK's punny Twitter response.

'Dear Trav, we only allow quality jobs on site... we've got 'Styles', you see ;) Love SEEK,' the job-search site responded. 

'I legitimately hoped someone on SEEK had that idea and had posted an ad, which is why I searched in the first place,' Trav told Daily Mail Australia.

'I tweeted them hoping they'd have a sense of humour and tweet back - but I definitely didn't expect that!'  

SEEK did not bow out of the Twitter war and continued to post comical One Direction puns to Trav

'@seekjobs was hoping you'd 'Malik' an exception ;)' one of Trav's responses to SEEK read

The job-search site used lyrics from the One Direction song 'Up All Night' to continue the pun war 

Radio producer Trav Roebuck (right) was impressed with SEEK's social media department's sense of humour

This response launched an amusing pun war with many of Trav's followers and SEEK itself.

'These puns are becoming a real Payne,' read one of the tweets. 

Surprisingly, SEEK was not done and were keen to still be part of the fun.

'We're going to be kept 'up all night' with this One Direction infection...' SEEK added. 

'Was hoping you'd Malik an exception,' Trav responded. 

The 2Day FM producer questioned SEEK's 1D knowledge and believed there was some Googling going on

Queensland Police have also had their share of comedic genius after posting that the wet roads in the morning could have been due to One Direction fans crying

The job-search company have not been the first to make a humorous comment relating to Zayn Malik's exit from One Direction.

The Queensland Police Service Facebook page posted a comment on Thursday morning, warning commuters to watch out for the slippery roads.

'Take it easy on the wet roads this morning. Possibly being added to from the tears of One Direction and Top Gear fans,' it read. 

The lighthearted post also hash-tagged '1D,' and has nearly 40,000 likes.

Trav admits he loved the positivity that the job-search site extended.

'I love companies with a great social media department, especially a company you wouldn't expect,' he said.

'Although, I do suspect there was a bit of googling members/ song titles going on between tweets!' 

On Wednesday, Zayn Malik announced that he wanted out of the pop group, who had found fame in 2010 on the UK X Factor.

Crazed fans have gone into meltdown, some even taking to self harm in a bid for the star to return to the group.
