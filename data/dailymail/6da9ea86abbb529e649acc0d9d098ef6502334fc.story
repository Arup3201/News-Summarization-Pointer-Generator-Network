A tornado briefly touched down in Washington outside an elementary school Thursday afternoon as winds ripped trees out of the ground and tore the roof off several buildings.

Debris sent residents of downtown Longview scrambling for cover as the funnel cloud hovered over several blocks in downtown and winds reached 50 miles per hour.

KGW reports that the swirling winds caught some residents by surprise just after noon.

'I saw what looked like an enormous dust devil and then these large panels off a roof started falling everywhere,' said Denny Malloy, who was caught in the wind while driving his truck.

'It seemed like everyone was pretty stunned.'

Kelly LaBeau watched from her car as the roof was ripped from an assisted living center. 'I said to myself, 'What is going on? There aren't tornadoes in Longview.' 

The tornado was strong enough to peel the roof off the gym of Kessler Elementary School, but the students, who were outside at the time and luckily not hurt.

Andy Bernard was in the middle of carving pumpkins when he heard winds gusting outside, and had to dodge a flying trampoline when he went to check on the commotion.

'It decided to take flight right at me and I ducked and the trampoline went into the house,' Bernard said, before winds caught the trampoline again and sent it flying down the block.

Destruction: The roof was torn off several buildings in Longview, including an elementary school and a car repair shop

Debris: Residents reported that winds exceeding 50 miles an hour knocked down trees and left debris in the streets that was later cleared

No injuries were reported and the National Weather Service later confirmed that the tornado passed through six blocks. 

Cowlitz County Department of Emergency management declared that the funnel cloud broke up north of Kelso shortly after it was first spotted.

County officials said all debris has been cleared off roads from the tornado but the NWS advises that severe thunderstorms were still likely through the night.
