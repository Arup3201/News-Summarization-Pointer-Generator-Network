The quotation, painted in bright yellow, is emblazoned in the window of Ashers, an unassuming bakery shop in Newtownabbey, a Protestant enclave on the outskirts of Belfast.

‘Come along inside. We’ll see if teas and buns can make the world a better place.’

For 22 years Ashers, set up by husband and wife Colin and Karen McArthur, has been true to that cheerful sentiment from children’s classic The Wind In The Willows.

In the fiercely sectarian district where the bakery operates, the McArthurs are proud to serve Catholics and Protestants.

But in the past two weeks, they have been at the centre of an extraordinary row, which has been raised at Prime Minister’s Questions and debated on radio talk-shows as far afield as Australia and the U.S.

Row: Daniel McArthur, 24, manager of Ashers Bakery, and wife Amy, insist they never meant to cause offence by refusing to bake the cake

The bakery’s name is derived from Asher who, in the Book Of Genesis, is one of the 12 sons of Jacob and forebear of one of the tribes of Israel. It was predicted that Asher’s ‘food would be rich’ and he ‘would provide delicacies fit for a king’.

The Biblical reference is an indication of Mr and Mrs McArthur’s Christian faith: both are devout Presbyterians.

And that’s the root of the row.

Their difficulties began when they took an order for an iced cake for Andrew Muir, a former mayor of North Down, for a municipal gathering in support of the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia.

The specifications were for images of Bert and Ernie (puppets from television show Sesame Street), the logo of Queerspace, a gay rights campaign group, and the slogan: Support Gay Marriage.

Ever since the McArthurs rejected the order on the basis that same-sex marriage is against their Christian faith, they have been subjected to a torrent of abuse on social networking forums.

The Equalities Commission, Northern Ireland (ECNI), funded by the British taxpayer, is now threatening to prosecute them and is demanding compensation for the would-be customers.

In response, a national fighting fund for Ashers has been launched by the Christian Institute, which has received almost 6,000 messages of support.

The bakers are far from alone in opposing same-sex marriage in Ulster — legalising gay marriage has been rejected three times by the Northern Ireland assembly.

The dispute has echoes of Christian couple Peter and Hazelmary Ball, who refused to give two gay men a double bedroom in their guesthouse in Cornwall.

The Supreme Court eventually ruled the rights of the couple outweighed the Christian conscience of the Balls. Baroness Hale, deputy president of the Court, declared: ‘We should be slow to accept’ the rights of Christians to discriminate against gays.

But last month, Lady Hale suggested her initial judgment might have been wrong, refused to make an order for costs against the Balls, and floated the idea of inserting a ‘Christian conscience clause’ into the equality legislation passed by the last Labour government.

Despite this, the ECNI is pressing ahead with its action against the bakers, alleging they are ‘acting unlawfully . . . under the 2006 Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination in the provision of goods and services on the grounds of sexual orientation’.

But is this politically motivated? Last year, the commission threatened a printing company because it declined to have anything to do with the launch of a gay magazine, of which more later.

The McArthurs, whose family have been bakers for a century, have received hundreds of messages of support from across the globe.

In the family’s only interview, Daniel McArthur, 24, the eldest of three sons — who runs the business because his parents are semi-retired — insists they never set out to cause any offence. ‘My mum took the order when the customer came into one of the shops knowing it would be problematic. As she did not want to embarrass the customer, she said nothing,’ he explains.

‘After the shop closed, we talked about it as a family, weighing up what our conscience told us against the risk our response might get some public attention.

‘As we don’t believe in gay marriage, and did not want to be associated with a politicised campaign, mum phoned the customer to explain politely that we could not accept the order, and would be returning his deposit.

‘She explained how we have turned down orders when they involved swear-words, nudity, or images that go against our faith.

‘We never thought we could be prosecuted for our beliefs. We are not discriminating against gay people. Our church’s definition of marriage is clear: it’s a covenant between a man and a woman, a 6,000-year-old tradition, which is ordained by God. Sexual activity outside marriage is a sin.’

Daniel does not look or sound like a religious fanatic. At university, he was friendly with gay students and says his family have homosexual acquaintances. ‘We have gay customers. We are happy to serve them,’ he says.

This week, the family made me very welcome, knowing I’m gay and in a civil partnership. ‘I have no problem in you coming into our home,’ Daniel told me. ‘We are just unwilling to endorse gay marriage.’

Daniel, wife Amy, 25, and one-year-old daughter Robyn, live in Ballyclare, which has Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, Plymouth Brethren and Catholic churches. William McCrea, the local Democratic Unionist MP, a noted gospel singer, was one of nine of the province’s 13 Westminster MPs who voted against gay marriage.

Daniel has a degree in aeronautical engineering from Queen’s University, Belfast, but joined the business as it was expanding, and runs the commercial side. There are six outlets, including a factory.

He met Amy, now pregnant with their second child, on a religious mission with the poor in the Philippines.

The family are members of the Trinity Reformed Presbyterian Church and talked over the cake order with its elders and minister. ‘They told us we were making the right decision,’ says Daniel.

So do their staff share their views? ‘Out of 62 staff, five are churchgoing Christians,’ he says. ‘Most had no idea about our faith.’

Daniel is bemused by the legal threat. ‘The commission talks about discrimination on the grounds of disability, race and sexuality, but never against people’s Christian beliefs. Why?’

‘In its letter, they found us guilty without giving us any chance to put our side across. What sort of justice is that? I am sorry for any distress we have caused but we are staying true to our beliefs. We pray that God will give us the strength to fight this.’

Beliefs: The bakery, which was set up 22 years ago, is located in a Protestant enclave of Belfast 

While they have been buoyed by messages of support, there have been critical and abusive messages on the company’s Facebook page. One man wrote: ‘Absolutely unjustified and disgusting . . . I know hundreds of people who will deliberately go out of their way to avoid your products.’

Another added: ‘Disgusting attitude of ignorance and bigotry.’

But others rallied to their cause. In a letter to a local paper, the News Letter, Brian Stuckey, from Denver, Colorado, wrote about an identical case in his home city.

‘Ashers bakery deserves the unstinting support of Northern Ireland for its commitment to Christian principles,’ he said.

There was a similar divergence of views among shoppers outside the Ashers stores, where queues form daily for their soda bread. Douglas Addis, a pensioner, says: ‘While some will say they are being old-fashioned, it’s not their views which count but those of the Lord.’

Alison Cornelius, whose sister is gay, says: ‘I know many Christians who are gay. It is terrible that the bakery is being discriminatory against gay couples.’

But Maureen Longstaff says: ‘Our church pastor says if you go into a pub the management has a right to refuse to serve you. What’s the difference?’

An hour’s drive away in Armagh, Nick Williamson, 29, had his own run-in with the Equality Commission last year. His printing company Bluefiremedia was approached by the editor of a gay magazine for a quote to publish their first edition.

‘They gave me a link to their website which contained a number of explicit images,’ says Nick. ‘I am a Christian, and did not feel I could provide the quotation.’

There was a complaint to the ECNI but Nick stood firm. ‘I don’t think Christians are given a fair deal from equality laws. Our rights and faith are trampled on. It’s time we stood up to the bullying.’

In the end, the commission dropped its threat of legal action.

This week, it refused to discuss the Ashers case, although it said in a statement: ‘The ECNI provides assistance to people who complain they have suffered unlawful discrimination. The commission has granted assistance to the complainant and will consider any response before taking any further action.’

While Ulster’s politicians have voted against same-sex marriage, the ECNI is in favour. Its website states: ‘The commission supports the introduction of legislation permitting same-sex marriage . . . with sufficient safeguards for religious organisations.’

But not, it seems, for small Christian bakeries.
