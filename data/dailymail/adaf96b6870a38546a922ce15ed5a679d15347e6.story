If you have ever wondered what - or who - your partner dreams about, there’s an app for that.

Curious people can use their smartphone to record what their partners say in their sleep, perhaps revealing details and desires they might keep to themselves during the day.

The Sleep Talk Recorder app listens for noises while people slumber and starts recording the second it hears any mumbling during the night.

People have more weird and wonderful dreams around the time of the full moon, a British study found.

The content of our dreams doesn’t vary with the seasons or with the days of the week, it showed.

But in the week or so surrounding a full moon, they are decidedly more ‘weird and bizarre’.

Psychologist Richard Wiseman made the surprise discovery as he analysed the experiences of 1,000 volunteers who were played sounds as they slept.

The findings build on Swiss research last year which found we take longer to fall asleep, sleep for 20 minutes less and sleep less soundly at full moon.

Production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin is also altered. Professor Wiseman believes that this may disturb our dreams.

Another, stranger explanation is that we evolved to be sensitive to the moon’s rhythms.

Upon waking the next morning, users can check their smartphone and listen to what they or their partner has blurted out during the night. They can also share a clip of their sleepy musings on Facebook or Twitter.

The sensitivity of the iPhone app, which costs 69p, can be adjusted to give people the best change of capturing any sleep talking.

Martin Lindau from Gothenburg, Sweden, came up with the idea for the app and said: ‘Sleep Talk Recorder monitors your sleep, but it's not just an ongoing recording.

‘An advanced filtering function qualifies sounds and triggers Sleep Talk Recorder technology in a millisecond.’

‘We think most people are curious of what is happening during their sleep and when they're not conscious. So we thought that it must be a way to catch this in an easy way using your smartphone.

‘Many users have reported their delight in finally having solid evidence that their partner snores or saying funny stuff.’

The iPhone app also saves the recordings and plots them on a timeline so people can spot any patterns in their night time conversations.

Emma Jones, a shop assistant from Portsmouth, Hampshire, has been living with her boyfriend for three years and says he talks during the night.

The 29-year-old said: ‘My boyfriend 
James is always talking in his sleep and I'm hoping to finally hear what
 he is saying using this new app.

‘I
 must admit I am a bit worried, though. It would be awful if it turns 
out he is muttering his ex-girlfriend's name or a girl that we both 
know.

‘If I wake up one 
day, look at the app and find out he has been dreaming about another 
girl - he could end up sleeping on the floor!’

Dreamers beware: The app could be used by couples to find out what - or whom - each person is dreaming about, which could prove awkward if it turns out they are subconsciously thinking about an ex or something inappropriate and blurting it out in the night
