With its manicured lawns, tropical foliage and neat bungalows, this idyllic setting on the edge of the Florida everglades would make for an ideal retirement community.

Miracle Village, however, is home to more than 100 registered sex offenders - half of its population - who have abused minors, viewed child pornography or even molested their own children.

Among them are a teacher, a pastor and a sports coach.

More than half of the population of this Florida village on the edge of the everglades are sex offenders

The 24-acre community was built in the 1960s to house sugar cane workers. In 2009 the late Dick Witherow, a pastor with the Christian group Matthew 25 Ministries, began making housing available to sex offenders.

Witherow came up with the idea for the village largely because of a Florida state law that prevents offenders from living within 1,000ft of a school, park, day care centre or playground.

Some cities and counties have extended that to 2,500ft.

Forced out of densely populated areas, Miracle Village offers sex offenders a place to live away from those restrictions - and it's proved so popular there are between 10 and 20 applications from potential residents every week.

The village is located about three miles from any other neighbors. It is self-contained, with its own water supply and sewage treatment plant.

Registered sex offenders living in the village include Pat Powers (left), the director of the Christian ministry that offers the housing to offenders, and Christopher Dawson (right), 22,  convicted of having sex with a minor

'In the beginning, no one wanted us around,' said Pat Powers, a sex offender who is now director of Matthew 25 Ministries, in an interview  in March with the Orlando Sun-Sentinel. 'But it's totally changed, now we're a part of the community.'

Married couple David and Lecil Woods said they would have no place to live if it weren't for Miracle Village.

David was convicted of a sex offense for engaging in what he claims was consensual sex with his girlfriend at the time, who was 16 years old.

'We had searched for places to live and nobody would rent to us,' Lecil Woods told the New York Times. 'If it wasn't for this place we would be homeless.'

The village does not allow offenders who are convicted of violent sex crimes against strangers.

Jerry Youmans, the intake coordinator
 for the ministry who is also a registered sex offender, told the BBC: 'We 
try not to accept people with a history of violence or drugs, or to take
 any diagnosed paedophile - that is, someone who can only become 
sexually aroused by a child.

The village was set up in 2009 by the late Dick Witherow, a pastor with Matthew 25 Ministries, in large part because of state law that prevents offenders living within 1,000ft of a school, day care centre or playground

'We want to protect the people who are already here and those who were living here before us.'

Some children do live in the village, however, as state laws allow sex offenders to live in the same neighborhood as minors, although some may be banned from having contact with them.

One such resident is 22-year-old 
Christopher Dawson, who is barred from speaking to anyone under 18 after
 he had sex with a 14-year-old who he believed was older.

He was sentenced to two years' house arrest followed by probation for eight years.

After breaching the terms of his licence, he was ordered to the village by a judge.

'It's been a blessing in disguise... I feel as though I have a destiny with Miracle Village. I feel at home and safe here - I love the people,' he said.
