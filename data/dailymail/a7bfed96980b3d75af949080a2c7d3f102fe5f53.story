Van Persie fired another blank on Sunday as United were beaten by Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City in the derby at the Etihad.

It was Manchester United's third defeat of the season and leaves Van Gaal's side languishing in 10th position in the Premier League.

In the absence of the injured Radamel Falcao plus the three-match suspension that Wayne Rooney served for his sending off against West Ham earlier in the season, the goalscoring burden has fallen on the shoulders of Van Persie, who has failed to deliver.

Gary Neville has spoken out in defence of misfiring Manchester United striker Van Persie

But former United defender Gary Neville defended the 31-year-old, insisting the Dutchman needed better service from his team-mates.

He told Monday Night Football: 'There's pressure on Van Persie, people want more from him.

'He's got to do better in long situations and needs to make better runs. But his team-mates aren't finding him as much as [Paul] Scholes and [Michael] Carrick were two years ago.

'I called him a burglar before - he lives off back of centre-backs. The type of pass he wants is into space. 

'In defence of Van Persie I don't think his team-mates are in synch as they were two years ago. Maybe Carrick coming back will help him.'
