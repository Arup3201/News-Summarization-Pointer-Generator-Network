She's entered into a life of glitzy mansions and luxury.

But life was not always so glamorous for the new wife of Hugh Hefner.

This dilapidated pub was one of the first homes of American-born model Crystal Harris - who has gone from dregs to riches now that she has married the Playboy tycoon.

Humble roots: The 26-year-old model was brought up in this pub in the back streets of West Bromwich

The graduate, who has a degree in psychology, was dubbed a 'runaway bride' by the 86-year-old mogul after she called off their engagement just days before their wedding in June 2011, with 300 guests due to attend.

After their split, she revealed she had only been intimate with him once - and very briefly.

But the pair reconciled in May last year and married in a lavish Los Angeles ceremony.

Hugh recently said he wants to stay with Crystal until he dies and insisted he doesn't care about the 60-year age difference between them.

The 26-year-old model was brought up in 
the West Midlands pub in West Bromwich - a far cry from the Playboy 
Mansion in LA which is her new marital home.

The Playmate's parents were British entertainers, who were working at the England-themed amusement park in Lake Havasu City, Arizona when she was born.

After Harris' birth they returned to England, where Crystal's mother Lee Lovitt was the landlady of Ye Olde Rose And Crown in the Black Country town.

Her family then moved back to the US when Harris was five-years-old to start a property business, where Crystal went to high school and university in California.

Crystal's new life could hardly be more removed from her humble roots in the West Midlands.

Since Lee and late husband Ray left the pub it has turned to ruin and eventually shut down four years ago.

Crystal's parents were popular landlords at Ye Olde Rose and Crown, where Crystal used to sing

Surrounded by homes and disused industrial land, the tavern has been left to 
rot into a state of disrepair.

In what was once the beer garden, a mountain of rubbish, including old beer barrels, has piled up and been left to rust and rot.

Nigel Pritchett, the most recent landlord before the pub shut, said even as a child Crystal was born to entertain.

He said: 'Even though Crystal was just a nipper when they were at the pub, she was known for having a belting voice.

'She would join her dad singing. Everyone thought she was amazing. They were known as a very nice family.'

Nigel said punters remembered her father Ray as the 'most popular' landlord the pub had ever had.

He added: 'Customers would come and talk about Ray, saying he was a 'live wire', very entertaining.

'He had pictures of himself and famous people he had met like Tom Jones, hanging around.

'I guess attracting stardom just runs in the family.

'All the pubs were busier back then than they are nowadays, but Ray would have it packed out seven days a week anyway.'

After she had returned to America, the pretty student was spotted by Playboy bosses after taking up modelling part-time to fund her studies.

After meeting 86-year-old Hefner she quit university and the pair started dating.

They were previously due to marry in June 2011, but Crystal called off the engagement when she got cold feet.

But this week she became one of the richest women in America when she finally married the ageing lothario in a lavish ceremony on New Year's Eve.

Crystal is the tycoon's third wife. He married Mildred Williams in 1949 before divorcing 10 years later.

In 1989 he married Playmate Kimberly Conrad and they separated in 1998.
