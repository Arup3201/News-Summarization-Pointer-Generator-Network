David Letterman has fired his comedy booker from ‘The Late Show’ after he made sexist remarks about female comedians.

Eddie Brill was sacked after saying he doesn’t like to get women comics on the show because they ‘act like men to please an audience’.

In an interview he also claimed that fewer women comics were ‘authentic’ - sparking a firestorm of criticism on the Internet.

Last comic standing: Eddie Brill, who booked comics for The Late Show with David Letterman, was fired for sexist remarks

Brill was fired by CBS for ‘speaking to the press without authorisation’ but Letterman himself, who has made a career lambasting public figures for their indiscretions, would have been sensitive to appearing out of touch with women.

In 2009 he was forced to admit a relationship with a female member of his staff on his show after somebody tried to blackmail him for $2million to keep it quiet.

The workplace indiscretion aside, many were shocked with the causal way he announced his infidelity in a 10-minute speech in which he offered no apology.

Then there was the fact he was going out with his wife-to-be Regina Lasko who had been dating for the previous 23 years.

Who's laughing now: Brill was fired for his insensitivity, but Letterman was under fire in 2009 for having an affair with a female staffer

They later had a son together.

It was an interview with the New York Times which forced out Brill, who was the warm-up comedian for Letterman as well as booking other comics.

He said: ‘There are a lot less female comics who are authentic. I see a lot of female comics who to please an audience will act like men.’

Among those who responded to his comments was comedian Amy Schumer who said that Brill only likes ‘middle-aged white men from the Midwest’.

The New York Times reported that 'The Late Show' booked just one woman during the whole of 2011.

He certainly has a type: Comedian Amy Schumer said Brill only likes ¿middle-aged white men from the Midwest¿

Six days after the piece was published Brill, 53, was fired.

Letterman has yet to comment on the episode but viewers will be reminded of his monologue in which he admitted to having sex with a female co-worker, later identified as his former assistant Stephanie Birkitt.

In a matter-of-fact voice he told them: ‘I have had sex with women who worked on this show.

‘And would it be embarrassing if it were made public? Perhaps it would. Especially for the women.’

He also gave details of how he felt ‘menaced’ by the man who tried to blackmail him. Letterman gave him a bogus cheque for $2million and notified the authorities.

Coming to his defense: Actress Lisa Lampanelli said Brill is entitled to his own opinions

Veteran CBS producer Robert Halderman was arrested and later jailed for six months under a plea deal which banned him from making public diary entries made by Birkitt about her affair with Letterman.

Brill’s post will be filled by other producers on Letterman’s show.

He was given support by female comic Lisa Lampanelli who said she had had no problems with him or ‘The Late Show’.

She said: ‘I was really surprised and unhappy about that.

‘It’s funny how you can get fired for an opinion. He should be allowed to say what he wants.'

Brill was not available for comment.
