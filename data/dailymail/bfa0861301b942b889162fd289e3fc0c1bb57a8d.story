The brother of a Muslim fanatic who died in Syria after bragging about his '5-star jihad' has been charged with preparing to carry out terrorist acts.

Mustakim Jaman, 23, was arrested, along with his parents after police raided their Portsmouth home last week.

His brother, Ifthekar Jaman, 23, died last year in a battlefield clash 2,000 miles from his Hampshire home last December after declaring he was ready to die a martyr.

He became one of the most infamous British extremists when he boasted on BBC Newsnight that the 'holy war' in Syria was like '5-star jihad' because of its 'relaxing' nature.

Mustakim Jaman  went on Newsnight to defend his brother, saying he died 'doing a good deed' and was always trying to be the 'best Muslim' he could. 

He was arrested by the south-east counter-terrorism unit on 14 October on suspicion of being involved in a Syria-related terrorism plot.

The 23-year-old was remanded in custody to appear at Westminster magistrates court in London tomorrow.

Jaman was arrested alongside his brother, Tuhim, 26, and his parents, Enu Miah, 57, and mother, Hena Choudhury.

His parents were released on bail on 15 October.

Jaman's 29-year-old sister Tamannah Shaharin, was also arrested in Greenwich, south east London. 

A 23-year-old woman from Farnborough and a 29-year-old woman from Greenwich, south London, were also held on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorism acts.

Officials said the arrests were part of a nationwide operation and linked to the Syrian conflict.

Police have warned that an increasing number of British Muslims are joining the conflict there and may return to Britain after receiving terrorism training.

The official threat level in Britain is set at 'severe,' indicating that an attack is highly likely.
