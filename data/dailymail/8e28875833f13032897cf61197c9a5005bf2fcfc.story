The mother of Michelle Knight, the third woman rescued from a basement where she had been held captive for more than a decade, says she carried on the search alone for years because police gave up on the case.

While the stories of missing Cleveland girls Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry have remained high-profile cases over the last decade, little is known of third captive Michelle.

As yet, no picture has been published of Michelle, either from the time she went missing or since her discovery.Â 

While family appeals for Gina and Amanda have been frequent and well-publicised over the past ten years, her case appears to have been long forgotten.

Now believed to be aged 30, Michelle was in her later teens or early twenties, when she
was last seen on August 23, 2002, at her cousin's house near West 106th
Street and Lorain Avenue, according to Cleveland's newspaper The Plain Dealer.

Her mother Barbara Knight now lives in Florida and said she never believed her daughter would have disappeared without a trace - despite police and social workers telling the family she must have left of her own accord.

Mrs Knight said she would often put up fliers around Cleveland's West Side and even after moving away, returning to continue the search on her own.

Michelle Knight's grandmother, Deborah Knight, said the family, after speaking with police and social workers, had accepted that she likely left on her own free will.

They believed she was angry that her son had been taken into custody.

Michelle was never registered as missing on the Ohio Missing Persons website.

Neither Deborah or Barbara Knight have heard from police as yet, and both are gathering what details they can from 
watching the news.

But Barbara Knight said she hopes her daughter has been correctly identified.

She added that she would be heartbroken to return to Cleveland only to find that Michelle was still among the missing.

'I'm praying that if it is her, she will come back with me so I can help her recover from what she has been through,' she said.

'So
much has happened in these ten years. She has a younger sister she 
still has not met. I missed her so much while she was gone.'

She told The Plain Dealer she believes she once saw her daughter walking with an older man at a shopping centre several years ago.

When the woman trailed behind her companion, he would grab her by the arm and pull her along, she said.

The disappearances of Amanda and Gina
captured the attention of the entire city for the past decade, as their
relatives have continually held vigils and kept the story alive in the 
local press.

After 10 years being held against their will, the women were finally freed after neighbour Charles Ramsey, heard screaming from the house.

Mr Ramsey, told WEWS-TV he saw Amanda,
who he didn't recognize, at a door that would open only enough to fit a
hand through screaming "Help me get out! 
I've been in here a long time.'

'We had to kick open the bottom,' he 
said. 'Lucky on that door it was aluminum. It was cheap. She climbed out
with her daughter.

When Amanda fled the home and ran across the street to call police, she was holding the hand of a young girl.

'Help me I'm Amanda Berry...I've been
kidnapped and I've been missing for ten years and I'm here. I'm free 
now,' Berry is heard saying in the call to police that has been publicly
released.

In January, a prison inmate was 
sentenced to four and a half years after admitting he provided a false burial tip 
in the disappearance of Berry.

A judge in Cleveland sentenced Robert 
Wolford on his guilty plea to obstruction of justice, making a false 
report and making a false alarm.

Last
summer, Wolford tipped authorities to look for Berry's remains in a 
Cleveland lot. He was taken to the location, which was dug up with 
backhoes.
