There was a time when children only needed to master reading, writing and arithmetic, yet a new toy wants to teach them how to program a computer - and it's aimed at four- to seven-year-olds.

Called Primo, the kit comes with a wooden robot called Cubetto, a programming board and instruction blocks.

Children place each of the instruction blocks onto the board in a set order to determine how Cubetto moves, before pressing a red button to set the robot in motion.

The Primo kit comes with a set of instruction blocks, bottom right, that children must place onto a programming board, left, to control a robot called Cubetto, top right. Hidden inside the board is an Arduino circuit that reads the position of the blocks and transmits the directions to a circuit inside Cubetto

Called Primo, the kit comes with a wooden robot called Cubetto, a programming board and instruction blocks.

Children place each of the 
instruction blocks onto the board in a set order to determine how 
Cubetto moves, before pressing a red button to set the robot in motion.

Each block is a different colour and 
represents a different command: the red block moves Cubetto 
forward, blue turns it to the left, yellow turns the robot to the right 
and the green block acts as a Function key.

The Function key acts like a 
subroutine, which is a set of instructions that can perform a certain 
task repeatedly, when used as part of a larger program.

Each block is a different colour and represents a different programming command: the red block moves Cubetto forward, blue turns it to the left, yellow turns the robot to the right and the green block is the Function key.

The Function key acts like a subroutine, which is a set of instructions that can perform a certain task repeatedly, when used as part of a larger program.

Built inside the board is an Arduino circuit that can read the position of the blocks and transmit directions to a circuit inside Cubetto.

When a child hits the red button, Cubetto moves according to the pre-programmed route. For example, if a child puts three blue (left) blocks into the board in a row, Cubetto will move in a circle turning left, left and then left again.

The Function block is used to help 
children build up longer patterns and users can place the blocks in any 
order to make Cubetto move differently each time.

‘Skills are mastered gradually,’ explained the developers.

‘Mountains are climbed one step at a 
time. Think of Primo as the very first step in a child’s programming 
education. Primo provides the very basic ABC of programming logic.

‘We insist on entertaining our children 
with tablets and smartphones, but we forget that children learn more 
effectively through physical play. 

Each instruction block is a different colour and represents a different programming command: the red block moves Cubetto forward, blue turns it to the left, yellow turns the robot to the right and the green block acts as a Function key

‘We wanted Primo to teach children the
logic of this incredibly important topic with a magical and 
tactile experience.'

Primo's founders are Italian but they are based in Islington, London. They set up a 
Kickstarter campaign last month to fund the Primo kit and needed to 
raise £35,000 by 22 December in order to start selling the device.

The company announced today it is set to reach this target within days but devices won’t be available until August next year.

A
 DIY version of the kit, which needs to assembled at home, will also set
 parents back £135 but anyone who pledges to the campaign can receive a
 fully-assembled version for £160.
