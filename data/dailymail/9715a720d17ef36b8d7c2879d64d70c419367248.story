A pregnant goat named Dora is the latest victim in a string of brutal attacks on animals after she was found shot by an arrow.

This is the fourth incident of its kind in the past month to happen in the Western Sydney region.

Recently, two goats were shot dead by arrows in the Blacktown area, a kangaroo suffered injuries when it was hit with an arrow at St Marys and a pelican was found with similar afflictions at Eastern Creek.

Dora was found injured by an arrow about 6.30am on Tuesday on a rural property

Dora was discovered about 6.30am on Tuesday by her 76-year-old owner who was returning to his rural property on Davis Rd.

She was found with an arrow lodged in her shoulder. It is suspected that the incident occurred during the night.

A RSPCA spokeswoman confirmed Dora was pregnant with twins when she was attacked.

'When we did an ultrasound we could hear at least one heartbeat and we could see wriggling around,' she said.

The expectant mother had an arrow lodged in her shoulder when she was discovered at Wetherill Park, west of Sydney

Dora is expected to make a full recovery and her twins will be arriving any day now

'So she should be delivering in the next couple of days – any time now.'

The spokeswoman said Dora had to be sedated for transport and would have been in pain initially.

She said the expectant mother had life-threatening injuries upon arrival, but was now in a stable condition and walking around.

'[She's] expected to make a full recovery,' the spokeswoman said.

The attack is now being investigated by police.

Police are investigating the incident and are appealing to the public for any assistance

Fairfield Local Area Command Inspector Steve Thomas appealed to the public to come forward with any information they had about the incident.

'These are cruel situations where animals are being shot…causing injury and death in some situations,' he said.

'At this stage we’re just seeking assistance from the community. All we have got is the injured goat.'

Insp Thomas said police would be ramping up their patrols in the area to prevent another incident from happening.

Anyone with information about this incident should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit www,crimestoppers.com.au.
