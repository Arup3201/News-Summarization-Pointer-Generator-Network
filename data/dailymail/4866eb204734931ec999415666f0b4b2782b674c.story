Relentless rains pounding Hawaii’s ‘Big Island’ led to a truck being swallowed Monday in a sinkhole.

Velma Deluz was driving to work around 5:30am when the road opened up and swallowed her truck whole – she fortunately escaped without any serious injury. The island received almost half a foot of rain from the storm.

Officials told local media the freak accident likely happened because the culvert the section of road was paved over likely shifted, causing the road to collapse.

Ms Deluz told KHNL about her terrifying plunge.

‘When I made the turn, the road just sucked me right in,’ she told the station. ‘I fell in and I tried to climb out the window because [the truck] fell on its side.’

The lucky woman climbed up out of the sinkhole and to safety before another car drove by, she said she suffered only minor rib injuries and is thankful to be alive.

Hawaii County Civil Defense spokesperson Darryl Oliveira blamed the collapse on a storm battering the island for most of Monday.

‘It was spread out from Honoka'a to parts of Puna.  Pretty widespread windward side,’ he told KITV, adding the rains were ‘a big problem because of multiple landslides, a lot of debris, a lot of different areas of runoff.’

He further explained to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that ‘the rain had caused a culvert beneath the street to shift, which then triggered the roadway's collapse.’

Ms Deluz had the misfortune of driving over the collapsed roadway, but was lucky in her escape.News footage from around the big island showed extensive flooding, mudslides and debris across roads.

‘It's been a while since we've had such heavy downpour with so much runoff,’ Mr Oliveira told the paper. ‘The ground's been pretty dry for a while. It's been drier than normal and now we're having heavier than normal rainfall.’

More than five-and-a-half inches was recorded Monday at Hilo Airport, almost a full inch more than the previous record set more than 60 years ago.
