One hundred and sixty square feet may not sound like much space for a family of three and their dog - but the Cox clan from Terre Haute, Indiana, are ditching their regular rental home in favor of scaled-down living.

Their diminutive home on wheels, which is nearing completion, will hardly leave room to stretch out for Cori Cox, 37, his wife Angel Tyra, 33, their eight-year-old daughter, Amelia, and Dexter, their 60lbs dog.

The dwelling, which measures eight feet by twenty feet, features living space, bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen, but minimized to the extreme.

Tiny living: Angel Tyra, 33, poses in the doorway of her 160sq ft house, which is nearing completion at a cost of just $20,000

Cosy: Amelia Cox, eight, snuggle up in the loft area of the tiny house, which is mobile but resting in Terre Haute, Indiana

Householders: Cori Cox and his with Angel, above, decided to downscale dramatically to lessen their environmental impact - and save cash

The change has seen Tyra throw out her shoe collection, and Amelia donate most of her toys to charity. The family has thrown out their beds, TV and any bulky furniture that would not survive the downsizing, according to the Indiana Star.

It has cost them just $20,000 to build the house, which is nearing completion. Their kitchen will have space for a shrunken refrigerator and an oven the same size as a microwave.

Tyra said she was skeptical at first, but came round to the idea later.

She said: 'When [Cori] first brought the idea to me, I said, "you're totally out of your mind... nobody lives like that. We can't do that."

But she came round to the idea - and the family is now expected to reap a huge saving from it - with their montly utility bill slashed to just $50 and the price of the property itself shrunk dramatically thanks to their own hard work building it.

Full-size: The diminutive house can be dragged behind a pick-up truck and - in theory - will comfortably house three people and a dog

Lit up: The house still get electricity - but combined utilities are expected to come in at some $50 a month in total

Sweat and toil: After an architect designed it, the Cox family was able to build the house from materials themselves
