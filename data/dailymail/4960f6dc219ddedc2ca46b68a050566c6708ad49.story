Los Angeles Kings hockey star Drew Doughty has been accused of raping a woman who rejected his advances - but is expected to be cleared after 'credibility problems' with her story.

The 25-year-old woman claimed she met the Canadian defenseman in a bar along Hermosa Beach Pier, California in March.

When he made a move on her, she reportedly loudly called him an 'a**hole' in front of his teammates, who laughed.

Accused: LA Kings star Drew Doughty (pictured after winning the Stanley Cup earlier this month) has been accused of raping a woman he met in a bar

The 22-year-old hockey player forced her into a cab and took her home, where he raped her, the woman told investigators.

She then took a cab back to her home and went to hospital later that day, where she was interviewed by police.

Doughty told investigators the sex had been consensual.

When police asked the woman to call her alleged attacker, with them listening in, she refused, Hermosa Beach police Sgt. Bob Higgins said.

Higgins told the Los Angeles Times that she had been 'less than cooperative' and prosecutors and police found 'credibility problems'.

The district attorney is expected to 
decide by Friday whether to prosecute, but TMZ reported he would not face charges due to a lack of evidence.

Doughty's attorney Craig Renetzky said that even though the details still need to be reviewed, he expects the case will be rejected.

'Itâ€™s under review,' said D.A. spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons, who declined to 
detail the allegations. 'I expect a
resolution this week.'

Support: The woman has reportedly hired attorney Gloria Allred to represent her, but sources said the case will be thrown out due to a lack of evidence

The woman has hired attorney Gloria Allred, who has represented numerous women in high profile cases, including Nicole Brown Simpson's family in the O.J. Simpson trial.

Doughty, who joined the LA Kings in 2008 and earns $6 million, had two goals and four assists during the team's recent victory in the Stanley Cup Finals.

He has also played for Canada internationally and won a gold medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics, when he was the youngest player on the team.
