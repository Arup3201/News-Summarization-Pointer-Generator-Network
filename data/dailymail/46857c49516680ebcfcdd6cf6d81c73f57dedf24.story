An 88-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of aiding his ailing wife's suicide will not be charged with any crime, San Diego County prosecutors decided on Wednesday.

Prosecutors determined that the case against Alan Purdy, arrested in March after admitting to being present during his wife's suicide and not trying to stop her, couldn't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, said District Attorney Spokeswoman Tanya Sierra.

The dropped charges come five months after Margaret Purdy, 84, was found dead in the couple's home after suffering for years over a number of ailments that had kept her bedridden.

Grieving: Alan Purdy, 88, is seen before a painting of his late wife, Margaret Josephine, whose suicide in March led to his arrest on charges of assistance

Her death was ruled a suicide by the county medical examiner – her second attempt, her family said - with a suicide note written by her found nearby.

Mr Purdy doted on his wife in her final years his family said but in the end he obliged to her request, taking a seat beside her as they said their goodbyes - her in her favourite chair.

'Yes, I sat beside her as she died,' Mr Purdy told the Los Angeles Times. 'I didn't want her to feel abandoned. I wanted her to know that I loved her.'

Mr Purdy was arrested not long after her death when he called paramedics to their home, informing them that his wife had suffocated herself, the LA Times reports.

He rushed paramedics to the scene, telling them that his wife had donated her body to the UC San Diego Medical Center and would need her organs harvested for transplant as soon as possible.

Detectives pulled him aside for interviewing with Mr Purdy telling them precisely what he had told the paramedics: he was present when his wife died and admittedly did not try to stop her.

Dropped: Charges against Mr Purdy, seen in his San Marcos home's living room where his wife took her life, were dropped on Wednesday

'She had mentioned for some time that she was under a great deal of pain and that this was a very hard life,' said the couple's son-in-law John Muster at the time of Mr Purdy's arrest.

'It was a great life. I loved her dearly and I'm sorry she's gone. I'm not going to second-guess her choice,' he said.

She had been bedridden in her final years from severe pancreatitis, an autoimmune disease, a crumbling spine and three fractured vertebrae that never healed.

Family members were opposed to the criminal charges against Alan Purdy, who was released on $15,000 bail following his arrest.

'I'm delighted to hear this,' Mr Purdy's daughter Catherine Purdy, a Berkeley psychologist, told the Times on Wednesday. 'I feel like justice has finally happened.'

Her father, Ms Purdy said, 'is very lonesome and unhappy. He lost his wife, and then to have to wait for this decision — it's been very hard on him.'

Married in 1997, after both of their previous spouses' deaths, the couple lived in the house Mr Purdy is now alone in for the last 15 years he said.

They share five children together, all of which were contacted by Mrs Purdy before she took her life. They visited her, believing it would be their last time.

Pronounced dead on March 20, it was just two months after she unsuccessfully tried to kill herself by carbon monoxide poisoning while her husband was away on business.

He returned to find her in the garage with a car's engine running. He pulled her out he said and revived her.

'She was her own person,' Mr Purdy told the Times. 'She decided she was going to die by her own hand.'
