Dave King has declared he sees no impediments to him returning to take a hands-on role at Rangers.

The South Africa-based businessman has requisitioned the Ibrox board for an EGM at which he, Paul Murray and John Gilligan hope to replace chairman David Somers, James Easdale and Mike Ashley placemen Derek Llambias and Barry Leach.

The current incumbents are resisting the request though, and have asked the regulator of the Alternative Investment Market to rule King unsuitable for directorship on account of his 41 contraventions of South African Income Tax Law.

King previously agreed to pay the South African Revenue Services (SARS) £40m as part of a settlement and was fined £186,000 rather than face 84 years in prison.

As well as satisfying the Stock Exchange of his suitability to take up a directorial role, King, who served on the oldco Rangers board, must also pass the SFA’s fit and proper person criteria which takes a dim view of criminal convictions and association with insolvency over the past five years.

Recent reports in his adopted country pertaining to the discovery of unlawful activity within SARS had raised questions over the validity of the investigation that led to what King this week described as a ‘favourable tax settlement’.

But, citing the fact he is already executive chairman of a public company, King on Wednesday waived his right to see that matter reopened by launching a staunch defence of his credentials.

A statement on his behalf read: ‘There has been media coverage in the UK following a report in the South African Sunday Times that dealt with the suspension of senior managers of the South African Revenue Services (SARS) for allegedly operating a rogue intelligence unit that spied on senior politicians and businessmen. I am named in the report as one of the business people who was spied on.

‘It was suggested in the Sunday Times report that this unlawful activity by SARS could put many of the recently concluded tax settlements at risk - mine included. This is an obvious conclusion for the journalist to reach. If SARS obtained information unlawfully and such information was used to coerce settlement with me (or any other taxpayer) then I could apply to have my settlement set aside. According to my advice that is the correct legal position.

‘For the avoidance of doubt I wish to make my position clear. I will not be making an application to have my settlement reviewed and/or set aside for two reasons:

Off-field politics have prompted numerous protests from Rangers fans this season

'1. My settlement resulted from prolonged and robust litigation that was fully in the public arena. There was no information produced or used by SARS that was unlawfully gained and, in my opinion, the individuals I dealt with at SARS acted in good faith - both during and after my settlement negotiations. I consequently have no legal basis to argue for the review and setting aside of my settlement.

'2. Even if my legal team could make out a case for review I would not pursue it. I am happy with the settlement and the opportunity this created for me to lead a normal business and personal life. My business interests have performed very strongly post-settlement with the SA government by far my largest customer. I am also able to enjoy my role as Executive Chairman of a public company without the integrity issues that previously dogged me.

'Importantly, I also now have sufficient time and resources to invest in getting Rangers back on track.’

The future of the Scottish giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems
