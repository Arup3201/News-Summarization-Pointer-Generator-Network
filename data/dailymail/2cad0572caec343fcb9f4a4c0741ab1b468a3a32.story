The father of a Dutch schoolgirl killed on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 has penned an open letter blaming Vladimir Putin for his daughter's death.

Elsemiek de Borst, 17, was killed alongside her mother, step-brother and step-father when the Boeing 777 passenger plane they were travelling on was shot out of the sky over eastern Ukraine by a surface-to-air missile last Thursday.

Now her father Hans, who lives in the town of Monster, has posted a grief-stricken open letter online outlining all the things his daughter had planned to do after leaving high school and accusing the Russian president and pro-Kremlin rebels in eastern Ukraine of ruining his life.

Tragic: 17-year-old Elsemiek de Borst was killed alongside her mother, step-brother and step-father when the Boeing 777 passenger plane they were travelling on to Malaysia was shot out of the sky over eastern Ukraine

Elsemiek and her mother were among 193 Dutch nationals to die when flight MH17 was blown out the sky by a surface-to-air missile while flying over eastern Ukraine last Thursday.

In an open letter written in Dutch, Mr de Borst said: 'Mr Putin, Many thanks to the Separatist leaders of Ukrainian government for the murder of my dear and only child, Elsemiek.'

'She is suddenly no more! From the air she was shot in a foreign country where a war is going on,' he added.

'I hope you're proud of including her and her young life was shot up too, and you can look in the mirror,' Mr de Borst went on to say.

High school pupil Elsemiek was travelling for a holiday to Malaysia with her mother, step-father and step-brother when the plane was shot out of the sky, killing 295 passengers and crew.

Outlining his daughter's plans for the future, Mr de Borst said: 'Elsemiek would next year take her final exam, along with her best friends Julia and Marina, and she did well in school. She then wanted to go to TU Delft to study engineering, and she was looking forward to it.'

Mr de Boorst's open letter comes as anger grows in the Netherlands over the treatment of victims' bodies at the crash site.

The Dutch have widely condemned the way the bodies of loved ones have been left piled up in body bags at the side of the road for several days as they rapidly decay in the summer heat.

'No words can describe it, said Silene Fredriksz-Hoogzand, whose son Bryce and his girlfriend Daisy Oehlers died on their way to a holiday in Bali.

'Bodies are just lying there for three days in the hot sun. There are people who have this on their conscience. There are families who can never hold the body of a child or a mother.'

'When I am in my bed at night, I see my 
son lying on the ground... I see Daisy. I see Bryce. I see them in my 
head. I see it. They have to come home, not only those two. Everybody 
has to come home.'

Ms Fredriksz-Hoogzand was among scores of victims' relatives expected at a behind-closed-doors meeting this morning near the central city of Utrecht, where they were to be consoled by King Willem-Alexander, Queen Maxima and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

Grisly: The bodies of almost 200 victims of the MH17 plane disaster are seen for a fourth day in a refrigerated train which has done little to hold back the stench of decay which has already overtaken the corpses

Mr Rutte told the families that getting the bodies home as soon as possible was his government's top priority, adding that he had made it 'crystal clear' that Putin must use Russia's influence in eastern Ukraine to ensure unhindered access to the crash scene for international investigators

He said a Dutch military transport plane was ready to repatriate the remains, which are now being stored in a refrigerated train in a rebel-held town.

'If the train finally gets going and the bodies get to Ukraine-controlled territory then we would prefer - and a Hercules is ready at Kharkiv airport - to get the bodies back to the Netherlands as soon as possible,' Mr Rutte said.

Right-wing lawmaker Louis Bontes has urged the government to send special Dutch forces to secure the crash site.

"This messing around with our people can go on no longer... Our people must be brought home now,' he said.
