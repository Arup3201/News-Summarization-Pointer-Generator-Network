A 17-year-old boy due to return to boarding school plunged to his death in front of a train a decade after his father was found hanged.

Jake Pirie was found dead on the tracks at Northallerton Station in North Yorkshire after being hit by a train on Sunday. His death was described by police as ‘non-suspicious’.

The public schoolboy had been driven to the railway station by his mother after spending the weekend at home in the Yorkshire Dales.

Suicide: Jake Pirie killed himself on the way back to boarding school in February this year at the age of 17

Star pupil: Jake was a top student at Uppingham School and was set to continue to university this year

He had been due to catch a train and then meet friends at the other end to share a taxi to the elite Uppingham School in Rutland.

As the upper sixth former waited on the platform he telephoned his friends to tell them he would be late and to go on ahead without him.

He was then found dead after he was hit by the 16.01 Edinburgh to London Kings Cross train as it went through the station.

Shocked: Those who knew the teenager said there was no indication that he was feeling suicidal at the time of his death

Last night his mother Sarah, 50, and sister Emily, 15, told of their ‘heartbreak’ at their loss. In a statement they said: ‘We are all overcome with grief following the death of Jake. He was a wonderful boy who had so much to live for.

‘He was so popular and enjoyed the company of many friends. We are heartbroken and it will take a long time for us to start coming to terms with this tragedy.’

Jake had been a star pupil at £30,000-a-year Uppingham School where he was on the rugby team.

Richard Harman, headmaster of the 400-year-old school, said that staff and pupils were ‘shocked’ by the sudden death.

He said: ‘It was with huge sadness and deep shock that we learned of the sudden death of one of our pupils, Jake Pirie, at the weekend.

‘The thoughts and prayers of all the staff and the pupils go out immediately to Jake’s family, especially his mother and his sister, and his friends.

‘Jake was a very popular boy at Uppingham, and he participated fully in school life, both academically and on the sports field.

‘It is so tragic that Jake’s life has been lost at this young age when he had so much more to look forward to in life.

‘Jake’s friends are understandably very upset - so all the school staff are pulling together to offer all possible support to them and other pupils within our community, to help them through this most distressing time.’

A short service of quiet and reflection was conducted in the School Chapel on Monday evening for pupils and staff.

The death is a devastating second tragedy for Jake’s family who live in a substantial detached house in the Yorkshire Dales hamlet of Thornton Steward.

His father James Pirie, who was a chiropractor and is a descendent of William the Conqueror, died in July 1999 aged 39 at their previous home in Rainton, North Yorkshire, when Jake was only four-years-old. He hanged himself and the inquest verdict was suicide.

Grieving: Jake's friends took to Facebook to pay tribute to him in the aftermath of the tragedy

The family had only recently moved to
 the area after relocating from Chelsea in London following the birth of
 their two young children.

Jake, who was studying for his 
A-levels won a scholarship to Uppingham in 2008 after attending Aysgarth
 Preparatory School in Bedale, North Yorkshire.

A friend yesterday said that he was not being bullied but said that it is 'a tough school'.

Grieving friends paid tribute to Jake on social networking sites. Hector Parkes wrote: ‘Won’t be sleeping tonight. My heart goes out to one of my best friends Jake Pirie and his family at this tragic time. Rest in Peace Jake.’

Holly Voorspuy wrote: ‘RIP jake pirie, chatting about the awesome times we were lucky enough to spend with you. enjoyed every second.’

Fraser Lane, who had attended prep school with Jake, wrote: ‘Sad day, thoughts are with you JP.’

Another friend from prep school, Graeme Francis, wrote: ‘Big love for my fallen boy. RIP JP. I will miss you.’

Unexpected: Northallerton Station, where Jake killed himself after being dropped off by his mother

The death has been referred to the coroner.

Uppingham’s 790 boys and girls, who are nearly all boarders, are educated amidst 120 acres of grounds with state-of-the-art facilities.

The school was founded in 1584, and boasts that its first pupil, Henry Ferne became chaplain to Charles I.

Later famous old boys include world water speed record holder Donald Campbell, Carphone Warehouse multi-millionaires Charles Dunstone and David Ross, TV personality Stephen Fry, Charlie Simpson of pop band Busted, and Harry Judd of pop band McFly.
