A world leader in aging research has died aged 73 following a two-year battle with pancreatic cancer.

Dr Stephen Coles spent his career studying the reasons why supercentenarians - or those who live to 110 or more - survived as long as they did. 

The longtime University of California Los Angeles professor died Wednesday in Scottsdale, Arizona, and his body is set to be cryopreserved in the hope of future revival.

Pioneer: Dr Stephen Coles, a world leader in aging research has died aged 73, following a two-year battle with pancreatic cancer

He is survived by his wife Natalie, daughter Electra McBurnie, and one granddaughter, Cailyn McBurnie. 

Coles' colleagues described him as a pioneer in the field of gerontology. 

His aim was to learn how to slow 'and ultimately reverse' human aging within 20 years by studying the genomes and DNA of the world's oldest living human beings.

He conducted much of his work through the Gerontology Research Group, which he founded in 1990 and printed more than 100 scientific journals.

Robert Young, who worked with Coles for 15 years, said that the scientist believed the primary driver of longevity was biological and not caused by the environment.

'He had 110-year-olds, and they smoked cigarettes,' Young said.

'Not that it's OK to do bad things, but that the people who lived longest are the ones who had biological predisposition for living the longest.' 

John Adams, another colleague, said Coles was an outgoing person with various interests.

'Although the effects of the chemotherapy and the treatments were debilitating, he remained mentally sharp. I was amazed at his strength and resilience,' Adams said.

Coles married his second wife, Natalie, in 2007 and the two worked together on scientific research.

Coles lived in Los Angeles but was in Arizona toward the end of his life so he could be put in cryopreservation when he died.

He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on Christmas Eve, 2012 and underwent surgery to remove the tumor. However, ultimately treatment was unsuccessful.
