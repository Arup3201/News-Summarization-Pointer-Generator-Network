Guilty: Robert Perez (pictured today) made groaning noises as he whispered obscenities to his victims

A Harrods chef made perverted phone calls and sent sex texts to five women who were his ‘fantasies’, a court heard today.

Robert Perez, of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, was said to have made groaning noises as he whispered obscenities to his horrified victims.

The 31-year-old had a stash of SIMs used to make the calls and one was found in his work locker, said Tom Gill, prosecuting.

‘Perez admitted harassing the females - he said he knew he could not have them but they were his sexual fantasies,’ he told West London Magistrates’ Court in Hammersmith.

‘He said he did it for his own sexual benefit and admitted (performing a sex act) and touching himself while on the phone to the victims.

‘He said he had thrown away all the other SIM cards. One was found in his locker at work.’

Perez was either at home or visiting family in Harrow, north-west London, when he made dozens of calls from May 2012 until last month.

‘Five females had been receiving sexually explicit texts and calls from May 2012 and they had continued to that date,’ Mr Gill added.

‘The victims believed he was (performing a sex act) and the content was sexually explicit. Harrods was made aware and he had not been at work when the calls and texts were made.’

One of the numbers he used was on a SIM card belonging to a friend of the chef.

When he was arrested, Perez - a chef at the world-famous department store in Knightsbridge, Central London - confessed: ‘It’s mine, it’s the only one, it was me, I made the calls.’

Chair of the bench Valerie Gorter told Perez: ‘We want a probation report but all sentencing options are open, including committal to the crown court.’

Perez pleaded guilty to five counts of stalking involving serious harm or distress to five victims. He was released on conditional bail and told to appear at the same court on November 3 for sentencing.
