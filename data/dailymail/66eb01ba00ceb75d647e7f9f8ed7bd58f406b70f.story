Clearly wanting to make a speedy getaway after his side's 3-1 defeat against Liverpool on Tuesday, Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha took advantage of the club's spacious pitch.

The Thai billionaire arranged for a helicopter to land on the turf at the King Power stadium shortly after Brendan Rodgers' men had sealed victory with goals from Adam Lallana, Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson.

And he wasted no time jumping in the chopper, even being filmed flying off by BT Sport as the channel continued its post-match analysis of Liverpool's win.

Pundits Robbie Savage, Michael Owen, Steve McManaman and Darren Fletcher looked on in astonishment as the Foxes owner and his entourage flew off into the night sky.

It was no surprise to see Srivaddhanaprabha make a swift exit after his side's loss, which came despite Nigel Pearson's men taking a 1-0 lead. 

Leicester have now gone nine games in all competitions without a win and sit bottom of the Premier League with just 10 points from 14 games.
