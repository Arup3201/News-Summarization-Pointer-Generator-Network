An ‘intelligent’ schoolboy bought a prosthetic mask and dressed in an old man’s suit as part of an elaborate disguise to carry out an armed robbery at a jewellers during which he threatened staff with an imitation handgun.

The robbery is just one of a number of shocking crimes documented in a new Channel 5 television show which reveals some of the most carefully planned crimes carried out by Britain's teenagers.

Also revealed in the show is a gang from Hull who terrorised families by bursting into their homes armed with table legs and scissors and stealing their Christmas presents.

And the Running Riot: Britain's Teen Crims documentary also looks into the craze of ‘steaming', which involves youths barging into shops en masse to steal valuable goods such as smart phones and tablets.

Miles Alura – a schoolboy in the middle of studying for his GCSEs – created an ‘old man’ disguise as part of a plan to steal £75,000 worth of jewellery from a shop in Kent.

The 16-year-old and his accomplice, aged 15, pulled out two imitation handguns and ordered staff to go into a back room before bagging up £75,000 worth of jewellery during the raid in 2012.

During the show, friends of Alura tell how the intelligent teenager was one of the top of his class and destined for good things before plotting the shocking armed robbery.

Alura was convicted of the offence and jailed for five years after discarding clothes containing his Oyster card and mobile phone while fleeing from the scene.

DC Angela Costin, of Kent Police, said: ‘It was very sophisticated to the point where you watch the CCTV from Victoria train station, and at no point do you even see members of the public giving him a second glance.’

One member of a ‘steaming’ gang - which smashed into numerous phone stores across London - describes how members would meet at a tube station which had access to several destinations, before walking into the town centre and bursting into a shop.

The gang would create chaos because of the number of youths involved, enabling them to swipe thousands of pounds worth of goods from the shelves and disperse without being caught.

‘It was fast money, easy money, it gave us good joy at times seeing a lot of money,’ said the young criminal, known as Mr Q.

The gang, who were caught on CCTV after removing their hoods on their journeys home, were jailed for a total of 11 years after the crime wave, which lasted from July 2012 to January 2013.

Also featured on the show is the shocking story of a gang of hooligans from Hull who terrorised families by bursting into their homes armed with table legs and scissors.

Joseph Wilson, 19, was locked up for four years for his part in the spree and his accomplice Macaulay Smith, 15, was jailed for more than three years at Hull Crown Court in 2012. The group's ringleader Aiden Mercer received eight years.

Their victim, Sally-Anne Hawker, said: ‘They stole thousands of pounds worth of my children's Christmas presents.

Ricky, 18, pictured left, and Danny Oakley, 20, pictured right, have both racked up a string of convictions since they were handed ASBOs in 2006

Ricky Oakley, now 18, has been in jail a total of six times since 2006, and remarkably describes the ASBO he was given at the age of 11 as a 'badge of honour'

‘It was the worst Christmas ever and I still don't like to stay in the house by myself.

‘We found a knife in my kid's bedroom which the police told me was there to use on me when I returned.’

The vicious thugs then took the haul to a pawnshop just minutes from Mercer's then girlfriend Gemma Fuller's house before buying drugs and getting stoned on the proceeds.

Miss Fuller said: ‘I saw the bags and I could see they were dodgy but I thought just don't ask.

‘I wanted them out of my house so we took them to the pawnshop down the road and got stoned with the money.’

Brothers Ricky and Daniel Oakley, known as the Demon Children from Hell for receiving ASBOs aged 11 and 12, are also featured.

Their crimes included racist abuse and swearing, carrying knives, throwing stones, starting fires and letting down tyres in Wolverhampton, West Midlands.

DC Angela Costin, of Kent Police, said Miles Alura's elaborate disguise to adopt an 'old man' suit and prosthetic mask to commit an armed robbery at a jewellers in Kent was 'very sophisticated'

Ricky, now 18, has been in jail a total of six times since 2006, and remarkably describes his ASBO as a ‘badge of honour’.

He said: ‘The ASBO really didn't bother me. It was like, 'We've got one, you haven't. We've been to the police station and to court'. They were a badge of honour.

However, his brother Danny, now 20, said he is desperate to turn his life around and hopes to avoid prison.

He said: ‘It was only when I saw us in the newspapers and on the TV that I felt ashamed.’

Running Riot: Britain's Teen Crims is on Channel 5 on Thursday 10 April at 10pm.
