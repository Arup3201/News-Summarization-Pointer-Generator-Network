At age 18, Kelly Rothe was faced with a terrifying prospect when a genetic test for a potentially deadly cancer gene came back positive.

Rothe, who lost her mother to breast cancer 14 years ago, chose life, becoming one of the youngest women in Michigan to undergo a prophylactic double mastectomy.

On May 10, the vivacious young woman flashed a smile and two thumbs up as she was wheeled out of Beaumont Hospital in Michigan a day after the long-awaited operation.

Since learning of the 'enemy within’ two years ago, Rothe has willingly become a poster girl for genetic testing, encouraging 20-somethings and even teenagers to be proactive about their health.

Given her family history, for Rothe the decision to undergo a double mastectomy as a preventative measure was a no-brainer.

Cancer has been a part of her life since age six when her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.At age 38, Nancy Rothe lost her battle with the deadly disease. Her aunt, Janet, succumbed to the same illness a short time later.  

Kelly spent a part of her childhood in hospitals with her dying mother and for many years was certain that she too was destined to die from cancer.  

Then two years ago, the high school senior learned of an early detection test that can determine if a patient has the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations linked to higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers.

Ms Rothe and two of her surviving aunts took the test. Three days after her 18th birthday, Kelly got the results, which turned out to be positive, Detroit Free Press reported.

The teenager cried and hugged a teddy bear given to her by her mother, she told Michigan Radio, but she expected this outcome all along.

'I went in to the testing thinking, “OK I’m positive and if I’m negative, that’s a nice surprise,”' she told Mlive.com.

The other thought that kept nagging at Kelly was: if only genetic testing was available when her mother was still alive.

Kelly Rothe was reassured by her doctor that she would not need surgery until age 30, but given her mother's young age at the time of her diagnosis, she was not going to sit around and wait for cancer to strike.

She knew at once that she was going to have her breasts removed, and she was going to do it as soon as possible.

Last July, she made an appointment with the surgeon who operated on her aunt. At first, he dismissed the idea of performing a bilateral mastectomy on a 20-year-old, but after talking to Ms Rothe about her family’s fraught medical history, the physician came around.

The surgery performed earlier this month was fully covered by Kelly’s medical insurance. Afterwards, she told reporters she was feeling sore, but satisfied with the outcome.

Moment of truth: Three days after her 18th birthday, Kelly learned that she carries the BRCA1 genetic mutation linked to 87 per cent chance of contracting breast cancer

Decisive: Doctors told the 20-year-old college junior she could wait until she turns 30 and has children to have the surgery, but Rothe convinced them she had no time to waste given her family history

Around the time of her 21st birthday this coming August, Kelly will be back in the hospital for breast reconstructive surgery.

Rothe, a junior at Eastern Michigan University, is not planning to let her genes stop her in her tracks. She aspires to become a special education teacher, earn a Phd and have no fewer than four children.

The 20-year-old Ann Arbor resident is marching in the footsteps of Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, who famously opted to have her breasts removed last year upon learning that gene mutations increased her risk of contracting breast cancer to 87 per cent.

Star power: Oncologists have noticed that a growing number of young women have been undergoing double mastectomies since Angelina Jolie had the surgery last year

Doctors have noticed a sharp spike in double mastectomies after Jolie's highly publicized surgery, which has been a cause for concern in the medical community, especially when it comes to young women like Kelly Rothe.  

A recent study found more than two-thirds of women who had both breasts removed after a cancer diagnosis did not have a medical reason for doing so.

The research showed that of 1,447 women treated for breast cancer, almost 8 per cent had undergone a double mastectomy. But 69 per cent of these women who underwent removal of the unaffected breast at the same time had no genetic or family risk factors.

On her part, Kelly has made it clear that she does not encourage young girls, including her own 17-year-old sister, to rush to the nearest hospital to have a double mastectomy.

The decision to go under the knife was all her own, and her father, Robert Rothe, supported his daughter's choice. .

Rothe explained that she did not want to wait until she had kids, like her doctors had suggested, because she said she did not want them to have the kind of childhood she had, whiling away the hours in hospital rooms.

‘If you had a bomb strapped to your body, would you wait or would you try to dismantle it? That’s how I explain it, and it usually gets people on my side,’ she said.

In her quest to spread the word about genetic testing, Rothe has been giving interviews and holding press conferences. She and her father also signed up to be in a new documentary called Pink and Blue about the BRCA mutation gene.
