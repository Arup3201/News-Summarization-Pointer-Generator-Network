The Israeli navy has headed off a pro-Palestinian activist ship trying to defy the Gaza blockade.

The Finnish-flagged Estelle was boarded 30 nautical miles off the coast of Gaza when the navy intercepted and diverted the boat to the nearby Israeli port of Ashdod.

The passengers refused to steer the boat off its course but did not offer resistance, the military said.

The Israeli navy headed off a pro-Palestinian activist ship, the Estelle, pictured, boarded 30 nautical miles off the Gaza coast, as it tried to breach the blockade

The Estelle has about 30 passengers onboard from eight different countries, and is allegedly carrying items like cement

The Estelle left Naples, Italy, on 7 
October, with about 30 people from eight different countries. It is 
reportedly carrying cargo including cement and medical supplies.

An IDF spokesperson confirmed the navy had boarded the ship and that no-one had been injured, but provided few further details.

Victoria Strand, a spokeswoman for Ship 
to Gaza, which sent the Estelle, told Associated Press that armed, 
masked soldiers boarded the boat and cut their communications. She said 
activists on board told her that some six naval boats surrounded their 
vessel.

'This is a demonstration of ruthlessness,' Strand said.Â 

It comes two years after the Israeli navy raided the Mavi Marmara, pictured, one of a flotilla of ships attempting to break the blockade

The raid on the Mavi Marmara, pictured, left nine Turkish activists dead. It sparked international condemnation which forced Israel to ease its blockade

Israel imposed the blockade after the militant group Hamas seized control of the coastal territory in 2007.

The Estelle is the latest in a series of activist boats challenging the blockade, many of which have been diverted to Ashdod.

Today's interception comes more than two years after the Israeli navy raided the Mavi Marmara, one of a flotilla of ships attempting to break the blockade. Nine Turkish activists were killed during the raid in 2010.

It sparked international condemnation which forced Israel to ease its blockade.

However, the movement of people and construction materials - such as cement and steel cables - is still heavily restricted.

The import of weapons and military materials is banned, along with materials such as fertilisers and certain chemicals.

Fishermen are only allowed to operate in a strip of water up to three nautical miles from the coast.
