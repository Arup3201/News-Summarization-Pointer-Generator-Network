Chris Christie started the week as America's most admired politician, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. He will finish it either as an electoral has-been, or as a Republican presidential front-runner with a reinforced reputation for integrity and a no-nonsense management style.

Or in other words, GOP observers suggest, everything President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lack.

'Christie showed some balls in firing his deputy chief of staff and his campaign manager,' a Republican election consultant told MailOnline, referring to long-time Christie confidantes Bridget Kelly and Bill Stepien.

'We're still waiting for Obama to fire someone over the IRS tea-party scandal,' he said. 'And Benghazi. And the Justice Department's habit of snooping on reporters.'

Tea Party Patriots, a conservative group, drew much the same conclusion – although its members say Christie's positions on immigration and other hot-button issues place him closer to the political center than they'd like a president to be.

Brash: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, pictured Thursday, offered dozens of apologies for his staff's behavior, but not before firing two of his closest advisers -- a move that could endear him to Republicans accustomed to seeing government officials misbehave without consequences

Heads won't roll: Republican strategists contrast Christie's willingness to fire dishonest underlings with President Obama and Hillary Clinton's habit of protecting their staffers accused of misconduct

Sticking around: Conservatives called on President Obama to sack Eric Holder after his Justice Department was caught snooping on journalists in 2013, but the U.S. Attorney General is still in his cabinet-level job

'Abuse of power by government officials is wrong, whether it's closing lanes in Fort Lee, using the IRS to target political opponents, or waiving the law regarding Obamacare,' the right-wing group's national coordinator, Jenny Beth Martin, said in a statement.

'Today, Gov. Christie held some subordinates accountable. Time will tell whether this is enough. We're still waiting for President Obama to hold anyone accountable.'

While many Republicans see Obama and Clinton as political bullies, New Jerseyans loyal to the governor with a personality to match their state's more enduring stereotypes bristle when they hear that label applied to their man.

So does Christie.

'I am who I am, but I am not a bully,' he told reporters on Thursday, as he announced that his axe had fallen on the necks of two long-time members of his inner circle.

'Politics ain't bean bag, OK? And everybody in the country who engages in politics knows that. On the other hand, that's very, very different than saying that, you know, someone's a bully. ... I am not a focus-group tested, blow- dried candidate or governor.Now, that has always made some people, as you know, uneasy. Some people like that style, some people don't.'

If Christie survives the 'Bridgegate' scandal, sparked by his aides' use of the George Washington Bridge on-ramps to punish a political adversary with unrelenting car traffic, he could face Hillary Clinton in a 2016 presidential contest.

That, said a veteran Republican fundraiser, would set up a favorable comparison for the New Jersey governor.

Resigned: Port Authority official David Wildstein left his job in December after the 'bridgegate' scandal began to heat up. He refused to testify in a state assembly hearing on Thursday, earning a contempt citation from lawmakers

IRS official Lois Lerner took the Fifth before Congress in a hearing about politically targeting right-wing groups, but she kept her job -- and her pension once she 'retired' -- in the Obama administration

'Can you imagine Hillary coming to the press and saying she fired the State Department employees who doctored the CIA's Benghazi talking points? And apologizing publicly? I can't,' he said.

Canned: Christie Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly got the axe, the governor said, for lying to him about a plot to snarl traffic in the town of Fort Lee as revenge against the mayor

'This whole thing will help him in the
 long run, not hurt him,' said the operative, who once raised money for 
the ill-fated campaign of Clinton's 2000 Senate challenger, Rick Lazio.

'After eight years of President Obama, this guy is a breath of fresh air. Even the tea partiers have to recognize that.'

And firing two of his closest advisers could be a move that endears him to Republicans accustomed to seeing government officials misbehave without consequences

Christie himself was all apologies on Thursday, offering his mea culpas more than 30 times during a 90-minute press conference.

Turning a New Jersey town's streets into a parking lot as part of a political vendetta, he admitted, 'was an awful, callous, indifferent thing to do. ... And that's why I apologized to the people of New Jersey today and why I apologized specifically to the people of Fort Lee who were inconvenienced over those four days.It's not right, and that's why I'm here apologizing.'

Diagnoses of Christie's political future have been decidedly mixed as his administration becomes more and more weighed down by the controversy.

One New York Times reporter's analysis concluded that 'the timing of the blossoming scandal is dreadful' for Christie, 'disrupting a highly anticipated plan to present the popular governor to the national electorate as a no-nonsense, bipartisan balm to a deeply divided federal government.'

And NBC News reporter Mike O'Brien opined Thursday morning that that Christie's credibility and his reputation as a bipartisan solution-seeker will be unrecoverable after the dust settles.

'If the Christie administration sought to punish a Democrat for being uncooperative, it necessarily becomes harder for Christie to paint a rosy picture about his relationship with Democrats,' he wrote.

Hours later, O'Brien tweeted that 'the early reax [reaction] among the GOP consultant class' has been that 'Christie did well today (on balance) ... But his story had damn well better hold up.'

New Jersey state Democratic chairman John Currie hinted that Christie isn't yet out of the woods. 'I suggest the governor try a new approach when answering questions: honesty,' he told reporters.

But behind the scenes, Republicans are betting that Christie will weather the storm. Some are  suggesting the episode will give Americans who don't live in New Jersey someone to root for.

Bill Stepien (L) was Thursday's second 'bridgegate' casualty. The former Christie campaign manager lost a chance to chair the New Jersey Republican Party and a lucrative contract with the Christie-led Republican Governors Association

Bridge to nowhere: Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich is suddenly a household name after Christie aides turned his town's George Washington Bridge on-ramps into a giant traffic bottleneck as a form of retribution for not endorsing their boss

'A state issue': The White House said Thursday that it won't weigh in on Gov. Christie's brewing troubles, but that line may change once the presidential season begins

'It's not too often that Americans get a sense of how politicians will react to a gut-check moment before they have a chance to vote for them,' said a Republican pollster who asked not to be identified. 'For Americans in 49 states, that's what's happening right now. And my own gut tells me that they're going to like it.'

David Axelrod, the long-time Democratic strategist and Obama adviser, told The Washington Post that Christie is far from mortally wounded. 'If he deals firmly with the offender, and the trail doesn’t lead directly back to him, my bet is that this will be a, well, bump in the road.' he said.

Christie's biggest problem, though, is still the split within the Republican party. Moderates like him, as do liberal-leaning Americans who vote Republican – usually on the basis of a single discordant issue like abortion. But the party's most conservative members still treat him with suspicion.

The popular conservative HotAir.com blog mocked Christie for a 'Sgt. Schultz-like apology of “I knew nothing,”' referring to the bumbling guard on the 1960s-era show Hogan's Heroes.

'Obama said the same thing about the IRS targeting tea partiers, of course,' one of the site's leaders wrote. 'To which conservatives replied: That’s no excuse.'

How damaged is Chris Christie? Maybe not at all, say some GOP insiders

@highlight

While tea partiers have little patience for the sometimes-conservative Christie, Republicans in general may see his candor as a breath of fresh air

@highlight

Conservatives draw comparisons to President Obama, who they say has refused to fire several underlings following their dishonesty in office

@highlight

Hillary Clinton, a likely Democratic presidential front-runner, also dodged responsibility for State Department messes including Benghazi, they say

@highlight

While Christie's reputation as a bully won't win him liberal converts, his hard-nosed, no-nonsense approach is attractive to many Republicans

@highlight

Any advantage he takes from his 'bridgegate' mop-up effort would vanish, however, if it's proven that he knew about the scandal and did nothing
