Manchester
 United's players have been getting to know new boss Louis van Gaal and 
will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial
 traits.

Here,
 Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new 
book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old
 Trafford.

Sir Alex Ferguson was famous for being the first in to work at Manchester United’s training ground and the last to leave.

Louis van Gaal looks like fitting the same workaholic mode - he didn’t even take time off from his job at AZ Alkmaar when he broke his ankle and leg in 2007 at a college reunion.

Committed: Louis van Gaal continued coaching AZ Alkmaar despite breaking his leg at a college reunion

Keen to show old classmates how fit he 
still was at the age of 56, he gave a demonstration of pole vaulting. 
Van Gaal completed the exercise but slipped on the smooth soles of his 
shoes, landed awkwardly and suffered a double break.

‘I was crazy enough to think that I was still 18,’ he said. He had surgery the same day at the Alkmaar medical centre and six pins were inserted to support the broken bones. His leg was put in a cast and for the next few weeks he had to use a wheelchair. 

After a full anaesthesia patients should stay in hospital for three days, but he left the next day to attend a match. 

‘Just to make sure, I swallowed a substantial dose of painkillers on the way to the stadium,’ he admitted. 

‘I wanted to be there. But I did not want that they would see me suffer.’ For the next few months he took training in his wheelchair, and never missed a game. ‘In football your legs are very important, but only if you are a player,’ he said.

‘Coaching you just do with your head. I have never missed a single game in my entire coaching career. When I’m sick, I still come.’

All smiles: Van Gaal goes to work even when sick and hasn't missed a single game in his coaching career
