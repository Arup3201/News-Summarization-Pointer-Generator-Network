Hugo Lloris says Harry Kane is now a 'machine' after bulking up and has become a 'complete player'.

Kane announced himself on the international stage on Friday night when he scored on his England debut in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania.

But it's his 29 goals for Tottenham that have stolen the headlines this season and with 19 of those coming in the Premier League, he is joint top scorer with Chelsea's Diego Costa.

'He's a complete player now. Harry has kept this desire to keep improving, to always want more. And that is what helps him push back his limits.'
