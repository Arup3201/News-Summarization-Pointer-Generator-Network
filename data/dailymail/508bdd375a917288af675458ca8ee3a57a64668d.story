Click here for updates on Phil Hughes' condition after his injury 

I never once worried about being hit by a cricket ball. It’s just something that did not cross my mind. I even fielded at silly point without a helmet because I felt I could get out of the way should the need arise. 

But the shocking incident involving Phil Hughes makes me wonder whether I was too gung-ho and blase.

I had plenty of broken bones, of course, and was once struck a glancing blow on the helmet by Brett Lee at Perth but you always just thought that you would be out for a few weeks and would then get on with it. It was part and parcel of the game and will always be so with such a hard cricket ball.

You never think about serious injury to yourself even when you see it happen to someone else, like when I was playing for Essex at Chelmsford against Leicestershire and two of Phil Whitticase’s teeth came flying past me at second slip after he was hit in the face by the dear, late Neil Williams. 

Whitticase was in a dreadful state, there was blood everywhere, and he needed dental reconstruction work but you think of it as an occupational hazard and thankfully injuries as experienced by Hughes are extremely unusual.

This, of course, is a huge shock and everyone’s thoughts go out to Hughes, a real fighter who has overcome adversity to be on the brink of a return to the Australian Test team. Those fighting qualities have never been needed more.

Spare a thought too for the bowler whose bouncer struck Hughes, Sean Abbott. He will be feeling absolutely terrible but no blame will be attached to him and it was good to see the cricket community rallying round him.

Every cricketer will be checking his safety equipment now and every helmet manufacturer will be looking to see if they can make even more improvements to their product, as they did when Stuart Broad was hit in the face at Old Trafford last summer. But the fact is, this is incredibly rare.

I would say to every young cricketer out there that it is 99.9 per cent certain that something like this will never happen to you. There are inherent risks involved in cricket, of course, but they are part of the game.

Every precaution is taken now at youth level to ensure that cricketers have as much protection as they possibly can. Helmets are compulsory for any hard ball match at schools level and that includes wicketkeepers too, because we saw with Mark Boucher two years ago that they are not exempt from the risks. 

I do a bit of coaching and one thing I will say is that I will be reminding my players of the need to stay alert in the nets when you are watching or waiting for your turn to bowl. 

Being hit at the back of the nets, obviously without any protective equipment, is almost a bigger danger than when you’re batting.

It was different when I was a kid. I didn’t wear a helmet until I was on the brink of becoming a professional and I was initially uncomfortable with a grille because I was concerned that I couldn’t see the ball properly.

I had a massive gap between my grille and the peak of my helmet and I was so superstitious that I kept the same old lid that would probably have shattered into a million pieces had it truly been struck. 

But I never thought about that.

Go back further and people like David Lloyd used to face the likes of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson without a helmet and he would even field at short leg without one. 

Can you imagine doing that? That was one area where I did draw the line. 

If someone like Matt Hayden, in my day, aimed a slog sweep you wanted to have as much protection on as possible and I always wore a helmet there.

Mike Atherton will tell you that helmets have been the biggest game changer of the last 40 years because there’s no doubt they have switched the game more heavily in the batsmen’s favour and changed techniques. Even tail-enders stay very much in the line of the ball now.

But that doesn’t mean that truly horrible accidents cannot happen and that’s what we saw at the SCG. At times like this all you can do is hope and pray that Phil Hughes will pull through. 

The cricket world is thinking of him.
