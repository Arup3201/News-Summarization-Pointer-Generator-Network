If you want to test how deep your love really is, then you can dive into married life by exchanging vows on board a luxury submarine in the Atlantic Ocean.

The one-of-a-kind wedding ceremonies are organised by adventure firm Atlantis Submarines and take place off the coast of Bridgetown, Barbados. 

The exclusive package can accommodate up to 48 guests, at £89 per person, and guests are treated to champagne, cocktails and hors d'oeuvres.

And the bride and groom also have the choice to take part in a romantic dive, for free, as a wedding gift from Atlantis to the happy couple.

General Manager Roseanne Myers said: 'The first couple that got married with us was in the late 1980's.

'Since then we have held a handful of ceremonies on the boat, followed by the dive or fully underwater in the submarine.

'Young couples are even more adventurous than ever and are often seeking something less traditional for their wedding day'

I do: The ceremony on the submarine last for 90 minutes, requires a minimum of 30 guests and includes transfers to and from the hotel

'But today's young couples are even more adventurous than ever and are often seeking something less traditional for their wedding day.

'So we decided to relaunch our 'How Deep is your love' packages for 2014/15.

'We can help guests to put together an amazing, tailor-made experience, with a back drop that is unbeatable.'

The package requires a minimum of 30 guests, and includes transfers to and from the hotel - and the extraordinary ceremony lasts around 90 minutes. 

The submarine also offers day dive tours to see the numerous fish and busy reef life as well as a very different night time experience with a more romantic focus on the corals, colour and night predators.
