These chilling scenes show what will happen if the deadly ebola virus breaks out in Britain.

Clad head-to-toe in sealed plastic bio-protection suits, medics wheel a stricken patient into an NHS hospital.

The space-age medical outfits – similar to those used in West Africa, where 4,000 people have already died from the disease – protect them from direct contact with the patient.

Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects, is present in all bodily fluids – including tears, sweat and mucus – of those infected. The medics in these images are wearing special respirators that enable them to breathe filtered air.

The actor was treated by paramedics and health workers wearing bio-hazard suits and mask, with plastic gloves taped tightly around their wrists 

Thankfully, these photographs are not of a real outbreak of the disease in Britain – instead they show drills ordered by the Prime Minister amid growing fears that ebola could strike here ... and spread. 

The exercises come after the infection of Spanish nurse Teresa Romero, who caught the deadly bug treating two missionaries who had been repatriated for treatment in Spain.

Mrs Romero is said to be gravely ill while another 16 people who she was in contact with are now being monitored for signs of infection. 

Last night Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer for England, said the UK should expect ‘a handful’ of ebola cases in the coming months.

She said: ‘The big problem is in West Africa where the doubling rate is every four weeks and it really is going up and up. So it will not be surprising if we have spill- over into this country. I would expect a handful of cases over the next few months.’

In an NHS exercise pictured here, an actor feigned collapse at a shopping centre in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, after telling passers-by he was not feeling well.

He was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle by an ambulance crew equipped to deal with an ebola case, where he was put into an isolation unit. After blood samples were taken – and malaria ruled out – doctors decided to send some to the Porton Down laboratory in Wiltshire for testing. The ‘victim’ was then transferred 300 miles to the Royal Free Hospital in London – the only hospital in Britain equipped with a fully ‘ebola-proof’ isolation unit.

In another drill, an actress was put in isolation after telling staff at Hillingdon Hospital’s urgent care centre in Middlesex that she felt ‘fluey’ having just returned from West Africa.

Dame Sally said the exercises ‘gave a very realistic test of how prepared the system is to deal with a case of ebola’ while Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘I feel doubly reassured that we have robust plans in place.’

The Department of Health has refused to spell out exactly how many drills took place and where.

The exercises were announced days in advance – but the Department of Health yesterday said ‘key people’ at the hospitals involved had been given only a few hours’ notice that they would take part.

Meanwhile, a small West African airline is to resume flights between London and Sierra Leone capital Freetown, amid continuing confusion about how passengers will be screened for the disease at Heathrow, Gatwick and the Eurostar train terminal at St Pancras.

German-owned Gambia Bird said it was resuming flights for humanitarian reasons. However, a spokesman for Gatwick said bosses there were still no clearer about what ebola screening measures would be introduced, 48 hours after No 10 announced ‘enhanced screening’ would be put in place at Britain’s two busiest airports and its main international rail terminal.

He said: ‘We are waiting on word from No 10 on what the screening process will include and when it will begin.’ He added that they had been working with Public Health England ‘and trying to understand what the requirements are’. He said that they still had no idea how many extra staff would be needed. 

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt will also chair a Cobra meeting as precautionary drills for the event of an epidemic are carried out 

Last night Professor Hugh Pennington, a leading authority on infectious diseases, said staff in mid-sized hospitals as well as specialist infection centres should also be involved in drills. ‘What happened in Spain should never happen – but things do go wrong,’ he said.

He also said UK screening plans would be ineffective.
