A Tennessee woman charged with attempted murder spent three years trying to poison her husband before shooting him, court documents have revealed.

Mother-of-two Misty Lee Addair, 32, left her husband Stephen for dead when she shot him in the back outside a rural house in Bluff City, Sullivan County, in June.

The 44-year-old was taken to Johnson City Medical Center in a critical condition but survived. 

Revelations: Mother-of-two Misty Lee Addair, 32, from Bluff City, Tennessee, tried to poison her husband for three years before shooting him in the back, court documents have revealed

He was found lying in the woods by his parents who heard a scream. His wife was then discovered by police in woods nearby with their two children. 

She was initially charged with one count of attempted first degree murder, but another was added following an investigation that revealed she had been trying to poison him. 

According to the Bristol Herald Courier, the revelations were unveiled due to work of the Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Veteran’s Administration.

However Sullivan County District Attorney General Barry Staubus would not reveal the details of the poisoning.

Addair was initially released on bond after she was arrested, on the condition she did not contact her husband. Now her bail has been substantially increased to $50,000.

A judge has placed her in a correctional facility.

In June, Sheriff Wayne Anderson said the couple and their children moved out of their Piney Flats home and had been living in Stephen Addair’s parents’ house.

Anderson said that the shooting was premeditated based on several factors, including Addair’s suggestion that her husband take a walk in the woods to check on a trail camera placed there.
