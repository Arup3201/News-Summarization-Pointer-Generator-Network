The father of classical piano group the 5 Browns sexually abused his three daughters far more times than he was convicted for, police revealed today.

Keith Brown, of Utah, was jailed for at least 10 years in March after pleading guilty to abusing his Mormon daughters Deondra, Desirae and Melody when they were children.

But a new police report says the abuse was over a period of at least eight years, happened hundreds of times for at least one of his daughters and was across state boundaries.

Sentenced: Keith Brown, the father of the renowned piano group The 5 Browns, pictured with attorney Steven Shapiro, was jailed in March for at least 10 years on charges of child sex abuse

Brown had emailed his daughters about 
the abuse before they went to police, the report said.

The 5 Browns are a classical piano group made up of three sisters and two brothers - Melody, Deondra, Desirae, Ryan and Gregory.

They were the first family of five siblings to be accepted at the same time into New York’s Juilliard School.

The Utah siblings released three albums that got to number one in the U.S. classical chart.

The New York Post described them as ‘the biggest classical music sensation in years’.

Entertainment Weekly said they are ‘button-down cute and somewhat otherworldly’.

They have performances coming up in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in November - before going to Ohio in December.

As one daughter got older he focussed on his younger girls, Deputy Utah County Attorney David Sturgill told the Salt Lake 
Tribune last week.

His crimes were close to being kept a 
secret from the public and were only uncovered by the media following a car accident near Salt Lake City that he was involved in just days 
after he was charged.

Brown drove his Porsche off a road and
it fell 300ft into the Little Cottonwood Canyon as he returned from 
a ski resort on Valentine’s Day with his wife - with police saying he was travelling too fast.

He was driving, and his wife Lisa, the mother of the children, was in the passenger seat. They were both knocked unconscious, but Brown woke up and managed to dial 911.

His lawyer Steven Shapiro has since reflected on the case following the sentencing.

‘The position of a case of this 
magnitude was to have it resolved as quickly and quietly as possible,’ he told the Salt Lake Tribune.

‘The intention was to not have this be 
any sort of a media event.’

Sexually assaulted: The Brown daughters only wanted to see their father jailed for a certain amount of time

Mr Sturgill said he would rather sexual assault cases were not covered by 
the media - but a support group disagreed.

Alana Kindness, executive director of 
the Utah Coalition Against Sexual Assault, told the Salt Lake Tribune 
she was very grateful to the young women for coming forward.

'The position of a case of this 
magnitude was to have it resolved as quickly and quietly as possible. The intention was to not have this be 
any sort of a media event'

Steven Shapiro, defending

‘It doesn’t matter what neighbourhood 
they come from or what family they come from,' she said. 'It helps break down those
misconceptions about who perpetrators are and who the victims are.’

The three daughters first met with 
police in June 2010. But many people close to the family already knew 
about the abuse before they came forward, Mr Shapiro told the Salt Lake
Tribune.

‘The girls spoke with investigators 
significantly after their father had already spoken with his 
ecclesiastical leaders and had a conversation with his family,’ he said.

Brown pleaded guilty in February to one count of sodomy on a child and two counts of sexual abuse of a child.

Mr Sturgill said the charges did not 
represent the number of abusive acts committed - but the women only 
wanted to see him jailed for a certain amount of time, so they got what 
they wanted.

A spokesman for the 5 Browns told the 
Salt Lake Tribune they are now focusing on ‘managing their lives, 
careers and the ongoing healing process’.

Judge David Mortensen said in March: 
'I think it’s obvious a home should be a refuge and a safe place, and 
that a parent should be a protector.’ He added that Brown was a 'danger 
to society’.

significantly after their father had already spoken with his 
ecclesiastical leaders and had a conversation with his family'

The girls were abused on separate occasions between November 1990 and October 1992, November 1990 and November 1992, and March 1997 and March 1998 in Utah County.

Brown's daughters did not attend court for the sentencing as they were on tour in Florida.

The 5 Browns are a Utah piano-playing group consisting of three sisters and two brothers.

The Brown women severed their professional relationship with their father in October 2008. He was once their manager but now has no connection to the group.
