While he may not be green-fingered, this Chinese farmer deserves a high-five for growing a huge hand-shaped vegetable.

Mr Chen, who lives in the Zhongjiang County in central China, has harvested an impressive vegetable grown from a mysterious sprout, according to People's Daily. 

The creative Chinaman then decided to use it to make soup, and it tasted like a yam.

Referred to by Mr Chen as the 'foot yam', the curious vegetable weighs 14.6kg and measures around 70cm.

Last spring, Mr Chen discovered some small green shoots in the abandoned vegetable garden behind his house.

'I never gave it any fertiliser so did not expect it to grow so big,' he said.

But he unexpectedly found the huge vegetable a few days ago. The duck house behind Mr Chen's home is suspected to have fertilised the ground which would provide the 'foot yam' with all the nutrients it needed to grow.

'This feet yam has the flavour of certain traditional medicine with a delicate taste and nice texture,' Mr Chen said.

He also said there was too much to eat, so he shared it with his relatives.
