A severely disabled California woman who was allegedly beaten by her 11-year-old son has died, according to police.

Authorities said 51-year-old Tracey Gipaya, of Elk Grove, passed away from a per-existing condition and they do not expect to file any new charges against the boy.

The child was arrested at his elementary school last week for allegedly beating his own mother so badly that she was sent to a hospital.

The 11-year-old has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse.

‘She did have injuries to her arms, to
her legs, to her back and other areas that we believe were a direct 
result of her son causing the abuse,’ Elk Grove Police Officer Chris 
Trim told CBS Sacramento.

On Monday, the boy’s father was given temporary custody of his son by a juvenile court judge.

The
11-year-old’s biological sister from Southern California was also in 
court pleading with the judge to release the boy into her custody, but 
her request was denied.

Despite his young age, prosecutors say the child was his mother’s primary caregiver and looked after the home they shared.

His name has not been released due to his young age and his mother’s disabilities.

The
boy was arrested last Monday after officers visited his mother and 
talked to him at school. Details about the mother's disability have not 
been released.

A third party told police about the suspected abuse, Trim told the Sacramento Bee.

Mr Trim called it one of the more unusual cases he has seen.

Weapon: The boy is accused of beating his mother with an extension cord

‘Typically the situation is reversed,' he said. ‘A kid will go to school with marks or bruises, and someone calls police and the parent is arrested.’

Officers who investigated the abuse report ‘confirmed that the mother had been beaten on more than one occasion’ by her son with an extension cord eight to ten feet long and equipped with several outlets, Mr Trim said.

The mother suffered physical injuries to her arms, legs, feet, chest and groin area, worsened by her medical condition.

Authorities said another person took care of the woman from time to time, but it was not known how long the boy had been involved or if authorities were aware of the situation.

Laura McCasland, a spokeswoman for the county Department of Health and Human Services, said she was unfamiliar with the case.

However, child labor laws prohibit anyone under age 14 from working as a caregiver through the In-Home Supportive Services program, she said.

The mother likely will qualify for help through California's Adult Protective Services program designed to ensure the safety of dependent adults, the newspaper reported.

‘There is quite a bit more to it, and it's very sad,’ Mr Trim said. ‘As tragic as it is, fortunately we do not have a death and we can step in and provide resources to the victim and hopefully to the offender as well.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
