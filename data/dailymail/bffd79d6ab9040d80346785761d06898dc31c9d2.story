It’s not as compact as the hoverboard Marty McFly promised us in 2015, but an ambitious New Zealand biochemist may have you walking on air sooner than expected with the first commercial jetpack set for release in 2016.

Aviation fanatic Glenn Martin came from humble beginnings, labouring for over 30 years on the ground breaking invention in his back shed. 

On Tuesday the company responsible for the jet pack’s development, Martin Aircraft, was valued at more than $100 million after it successfully floated on the Australian Stock Market, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Emergency services teams such as the police force, fire service, search & rescue, disaster recovery and border security are waiting to receive the highly sought-after technology - which will set customers back $255,000 a pop. 

With its slight frame and ability to navigate tightly confined spaces, the jet pack has the potential to go places other emergency services vehicles cannot, providing a practical alternative to traditional helicopters.

Peter Coker, CEO of Martin Aircraft, says they're aiming to distribute the crafts to emergency responders and commercial customers by the third quarter of 2016, with an expectation of producing 500 per year, with a view to grow supply. 

The Martin jetpack is made possible by two large ducted fans driven by a V4 200 horsepower petrol engine which can propel the craft for up to 30 minutes at a speed of up to 74km/h and height of 1000 metres.

Martin Aircraft shares attracted a 10 per cent increase from the initial stock price, with some attributing the success to a significant investment made by Chinese aerospace group Kuang-Chi Science, who have pledged up to $50 million over the next 2 and a half years to get the crafts in the air. 

The partnership with the Kuang-Chi Science company could prove to be more than financially beneficial as they are already a world leader in artificial materials and aeronautical technology.

Martin Aircraft plan to launch an unmanned version that can carry up to 120kg over difficult terrain and water in a bid to appeal to military, mining or farming industries. 

Coker says they have their eyes set on creating a 'jetpack experience' for the tourism and entertainment market with hopes the personal jetpack could be on the market for the public by 2017.
