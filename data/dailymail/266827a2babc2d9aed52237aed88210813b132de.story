Varifocal lenses usually come with a premium price – with opticians charging up to £398 for just one pair

A price war has been triggered by Asda as it claims the elderly are being ripped off on varifocal glasses by £144 million a year.

Varifocal lenses are worn by those who need help both with long distances, for example when driving, and reading, due to eye deteroriation which generally occurs with age.

The lenses usually come with a premium price – with opticians charging up to £398 for just one pair.

However, Asda is challenging the High Street by offering varifocal lenses for the same price as single prescription versions, starting at just £40.

The chain will also sell a designer frame option at £70, with two pairs for £99, and a premium range for £100, with two pairs for £159.

Asda found that designer frames with varifocal lenses cost up to £398 at Optical Express, £240 at Boots, £211 at Vision Express with UV protection, £188 at Specsavers and £175 at Tesco Opticians.

Asda calculated the figure of £144 million by working out the difference in price between its varifocal lenses and competitiors’, judged against the fact that three million pensioners bought varifocal lenses in the last 12 months, according to the Mintel Optical Goods Retailing report.

Asda’s director for optical healthcare, Linsey Taylor, said: ‘We have been shocked at how much the optical industry is currently charging its customers for varifocal prescriptions.’

Asda claims the elderly are being ripped off on varifocal glasses by £144 million a year and is now offering them from from £40

Last night a spokesman for Optical Express said that none of the 20 Asda Opticians it called yesterday sold the same brand of products that it sells.

Vision Express chief executive Jonathan Lawson said it sells varifocal glasses ‘from as little as £79’.

Boots said it gives all customers who qualify for NHS vouchers free varifocal lenses. 

Specsavers accused Asda of ‘confusing the issue’ and said it sells varifocal lenses for £69. Tesco did not respond to requests for comment.
