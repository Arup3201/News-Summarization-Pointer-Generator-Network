The gardens of a historic museum have been transformed with an extraordinary display of illuminations.

Holburne Museum in Bath, Somerset, is normally known for it collection of paintings, silver and sculptures.

But this Christmas visitors can experience a different style of art altogether by wandering through the 'Circuit: A Light Labyrinth' installment in the garden.

'Circuit: A Light Labyrinth' has opened at the Holburne Museum, Bath, Somerset. The delicate strands of illuminated wire create an eerie effect

A young boy walks through the light labyrinth in Bath. Alongside the lights artist Charlie Kerr says visitors can enjoy an "aural tapestry reminiscent of Georgian Bath with echoes of our own time"

Artists Charlie Kerr and Martin Richman 
took over the open space for their project which is made up of 
delicate strands of different coloured lights which create a web-like 
maze of light.

While in the maze, visitors hear sounds, music and snatches of 
conversation which are designed to be 'reminiscent of Georgian Bath'.

Mr Richman said 'The Museum was once an hotel that led into adjacent 
eighteenth century pleasure gardens which were frequented by patrons who
enjoyed grottos, illuminations, a labyrinth and perhaps a saucy 
dalliance in the protective shadows.

'We hope to create an engaging visual and aural experience for all ages 
to participate within, which will engender echoes of history and place, 
providing an engaging, transformative experience of the garden of the 
Holburne as turns are taken and turned again.'

The movement of light creates patterns in a similar way to sparklers on fireworks night as visitors interact with the art work

'Circuit: A Light Labyrinth' surrounds one of the buildings at the Holburne Museum in Bath. The picturesque museum houses a collection of fine art mainly from the 17th and 18th century

The artists have worked together on 
projects before. Mr Richman is a light artist while Mr Kerr creates a 
'soundscape' to work alongside the visual imagery. 

This years installation follows on 
from the success of Bruce Munro’s Field of Light which was displayed in 
the grounds of the museum last year.

The installation opened on Wednesday November 28 and will run until January 2013.

The web like maze is created using different coloured electroluminescent wire while music and conversation snippets are played to create a 'sound picture', Mr Kerr says

Nine-year-old Noah Homes looks almost ethereal as he wanders through the light wires

People wear head torches and carry glow sticks as they navigate their way around the maze

Up close the wires look like a confusing mass of colour and light

The lights look less impressive in the day time as you can see the poles which used to hold the installation in place and the loops of extra wire

Noah Homes creates light trails as he plays with a glow stick as darkness begins to fall

The glow stick lights the way for Noah as he wanders through the wires which almost come up to his head at the Holburne Museum

Visitors carry glow sticks so as they move they add to the other-worldly effect for those looking into the maze of electric wires

The piece uses both light and sound to create what artist Charlie Kerr calls an 'aural tapestry' which combines the old with the new
