Twins are always special in a family but these baby sisters are a truly rare double delight.

At estimated odds of four-billion-to-one, Jessica and Clara Gwynne represent the fourth generation of twins in one family.

They follow in the footsteps of their mother Mel and their grandfather and great-grandmother – all of whom were twins.

Mrs Gwynne, 36, discovered she was carrying twins at her 12-week scan after spotting the image of a second head on a monitor.

She said: ‘It was a bit of a shock really. Although deep down I think I’ve always known that me or my sister Sherrill would have twins.

'They did the scan and I could see on the screen they were looking at the one baby and I saw something else which in the corner and I thought well there’s nothing else that could be round like that apart from another head.

'And I thought no, don’t be silly and then she moved it over and she went “and there’s twin two”.'

The girls – who are featured in Channel 4’s One Born Every Minute tonight – were born five weeks premature and spent the first few weeks of life in a special care baby unit. They are now seven months old.

The pattern for twins in the family began with Jessica and Clara’s great-grandmother, Joyce Garrad, who had a twin named Margaret.

Joyce went on to give birth to Kevin and Keith, 60, and Kevin and his wife had Mel and Sherrill.

Mel Gwynne, a school kitchen manager from Bristol, is anticipating that her girls will develop the same close bond she shares with her identical sister.

However, she and her husband Chris are adamant she won’t dress them in identical clothes.

She said: ‘My Nan always used to put me and my sister in the same thing and we hated it. We hated being the same because we were separate people.’

At times she has seen spooky visions of her twin which turned out to be true, she said.

'One
 time Sherrill had already gone to school and I was off sick and I woke 
up and said to mum “I want to wear my leg warmers” and she said “you’re 
not going anywhere, what do you want to wear your leg warmers for?”', 
she said.

Twice the effort: Mrs Gwynne said she always knew she or her sister would end up having twins

'And I said 
“because Sherrill’s got hers on, I want to wear mine”. But I wouldn’t 
have known because I was asleep when she was getting ready.’

On
 other occasions Mrs Gwynne knew when her sister hurt herself – once 
picturing the smiley face plaster the school nurse had just put on 
Sherrill’s knee. And she said she often knows when her sister is about 
to phone.

In the UK there is a 112-to-one chance of a pregnancy resulting in non-identical twins. US health journal, Forensic Science International, estimate the odds of four generations of twins in one family are one in four billion.

However, yesterday Jane Denton of the Multiple Births Foundation said it was difficult to estimate how common fourth generation twins are as it depends on whether they are identical or non-identical, and a database tracking this information is not known about.

She said: ‘It is terribly complicated. The rate of identical twinning is fairly constant, for any woman anywhere there is about a three to five per thousand risk.

'But with non-identicals there is a rare gene carried by females. So if a woman carrying the gene has twins, her daughter has a four times greater chance of having twins herself.'
