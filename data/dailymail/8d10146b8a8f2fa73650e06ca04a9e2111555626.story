Companies should be able to ask their employees about whether they hope to have children, Sheryl Sandberg, one of the most senior women in Silicon Valley, said.

Ms Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, said that women are held back at work
 by stereotypes firms are unwilling to talk about. She said employees faced both open and covert  discrimination, as well as a lack of flexibility. 

The 43-year-old mother-of-two called for a much 
more open dialogue about gender, which included discussing with
 female employees whether they plan to have children, The Telegraph reported her as saying.

Achiever: Sandberg urges women not to stop prioritising their career

'Every HR department tells you not to do that … but we need to have a much more open conversation,' she said.

Ms Sandberg, who earned US$30.87m 
  (£19.5m) from Facebook in 2011 was speaking to business leaders at the 
World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, at a 
session on how boost women’s role in economic decision making.

Ms Sandberg at one point asked men in the session to raise their hands if they had ever been asked whether they should be working, given that they have children. None put their hands up, in contrast to the several women who did when the same question was asked of them.

U.S. law essentially prohibits employers from asking female job applicants if they are planning to have children in the future.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it illegal to discriminate in employment on the bases of race, color, sex, national origin, and religion, was amended in 1978 to include the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.

The federal law prohibits an employer from refusing to hire a pregnant woman because of her pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition.

Under UK law, recruiters may not ask 
female job candidates whether they have children or are planning to have
 any. However anecdotally, it is thought that many avoid women of 
child-bearing age and advise women who are not planning to have children
 or who have had a family already to make this clear at interview to 
increase their chances of getting a job offer.

Ms Sandberg
 cited a conversation she had had with her lawyer, who had told her not 
to publish an article urging women to 'lean in' to their careers – as 
opposed to pulling back from them – before starting a family.

'Then
 I thought, he works for me ... If someone wants to sue me because I’m 
talking about gender discrimination, go ahead,' she said.

Stereotypes: messages about gender that hold women back in the workplace are reinforced from an early age, says Sandberg

Her book Lean In, which encourages women to get further in the workplace, is due out in March.

Ms Sandberg also attacked gender stereotypes that she said were still stacked heavily against women.

She highlighted T-shirts currently sold in the US, where a boys' version bears the words 'Smart Like Daddy', while the girls' version says 'Pretty like Mummy'.'I would love to say that was 1951, but it was last year,' she said.

She said the attitudes enshrined in those slogans led to the paradox that as a woman becomes more successful, she becomes less popular, whereas when a man becomes more successful, he becomes more popular.

She also said women received less 
encouragement to excel at work, saying: 'Think of it like a marathon. 
Everyone’s cheering the men on. The messages for women are different: 
are you sure you want to run, don’t you want to run, don’t you have kids
 at home?'

Guilt: Mums at the session were more likely than dads to have been asked whether they ought to be working given that they had children

Sandberg also criticized the fact that it is still assumed women will take on the majority of the caring responsibilities at home, even when both parents work.

Unusually for Davos events, five of six speakers on the panel at the discussion were female.

Only one in six delegates at the high-powered event are women, though organisers have been trying to redress the balance.

Top 100 'strategic partner' companies that attend and which can send five delegates have been told they must include one women. Many, however, choose to send only four rather than include a female executive.
