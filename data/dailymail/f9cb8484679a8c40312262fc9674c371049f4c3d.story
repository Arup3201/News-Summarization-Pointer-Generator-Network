By SALLY JONES FOR THE DAILY MAIL 

The call came while I was sitting in my daughter’s Oxford study. ‘Congratulations. I’m delighted to tell you that you’ve been selected to appear on Mastermind,’ said the producer. ‘We’ll be in touch soon to finalise dates and your specialist subjects.’

My stomach turned over with a familiar pang — half-excitement, half-terror at the thought of my fourth appearance on the cult show.

Why do I keep putting myself through this? It must be the dangerous thrill of that Approaching Menace theme tune, the black leather chair, the blinding spotlights that induce brain‑numbing panic and John Humphrys, trying unsuccessfully to sound avuncular.

‘And is your daughter, Madeline, there?’ asked the voice. ‘I need to speak to her, too.’

Madeline, 21, listened intently for a second and then squealed in delight and hugged me.

Mastermind had always been a cult show in our house and now she had got the call, too — one of the youngest ever contestants, one of just a handful of female quizzers and part of the first ever ‘family double’ of mother and daughter competing in the same season.

Days earlier she had been gutted to miss out on University Challenge. She and her brother, Roly, were each picked for their college teams, Madeline captaining St Hilda’s, Oxford, and Roly, 22, reserve for Caius, Cambridge. But neither appeared in the televised version as the colleges were whittled down to just a handful of uber-geeks.

As a BBC Breakfast sports presenter, I had worked alongside Jeremy Paxman in the Eighties. During the University Challenge qualifier, he joked with my children that he chiefly remembered me for mangling the word ‘dioceses’. I resisted the temptation to tell them what I chiefly remembered him for!

Both had always loved quizzes and, aged ten, Roly even reached the final of Britain’s Brainiest Kid, presented by a young Tess Daly.

‘She’s very pretty’ he confided afterwards, ‘but she couldn’t even pronounce Jerusalem!’

Madeline’s alma mater, King Edward VI High School for Girls in Birmingham, has a strong quiz tradition. Aged 13, she was in the Schools Challenge side that reached the national finals.

Maybe it’s in the genes. During childbirth, I deadened the pain of contractions with an epidural and played Trivial Pursuit with my husband, John, for hours. He now claims he let me win. As if!

Over the years I’ve appeared on Krypton Factor, Crosswits, Fifteen to One and a host of pub quizzes and charity events.

During a lucrative outing, aged 18, on Sale Of The Century, which paid for several weeks of tennis tournaments, I became flustered when asked to spell ‘pseudonym’ and blurted out: ‘P-s-u-e-d . . . no, that’s not it . . . p-s-u-e-d . . . oh, bugger it!’

Nicholas Parsons, with ineffable condescension (and the answer on a card in front of him) intoned: ‘Sally, when you get to Oxford, take a dictionary and you will see that it’s spelt p-s-e-u-d-o-n-y-m.’

Mastermind, however, remains the single most nerve-wracking experience of my life.

Quizzing is fractionally more male-dominated and gladiatorial than professional rugby league and populated by anoraks with halitosis and low-level jobs, maybe because they spend every spare minute hoovering up obscure facts in order to clean up at pub quizzes.

Any woman who admits to the same perverse taste for memorising trivia, from U.S. state capitals to Monopoly board squares, in order, is treated with pitying contempt — or, if she wins, outright aggression.

Drawn by a curious masochism, I first entered Mastermind in 2009 and squeaked through the first round — specialist subject: Saki’s short stories — narrowly beating three (delightful and supportive) blokes with immaculate personal hygiene, only to find a hostile taunt on my Wikipedia entry.

‘Despite being “a so-called sports journalist”, she failed to recall that Phil Vickery captained England in the 2007 World Cup. Pathetic!’

I bowed out in the semi‑final to the eventual (female) winner.

Never imagining I would get through the first round, I had thoughtlessly picked tennis star and feminist campaigner Billie-Jean King as my specialist subject, a horribly broad topic as her career lasted several decades.

Why hadn’t I chosen Maureen ‘Little Mo’ Connolly who won her first three Wimbledons in the Fifties then retired, aged 18, after smashing her leg in a riding accident?

This time — for an episode to be aired tomorrow — I chose John Betjeman’s poetry (it’s entertaining and easily memorable), and selected a sparkly frock but manageable heels: the polished Mastermind walkway is narrow and slippery.

Madeline and I tested each other to distraction, memorising lists of British Prime Ministers, flags of the world, Booker Prize winners and African capitals.

We arrived at the Manchester studios — she excited, me numb with terror.

Of course, nothing we’d memorised cropped up in the all-important general knowledge questions — though Betjeman’s ‘usual suspects’ Miss Joan Hunter Dunn and Pam the ‘great big mountainous sports girl’ were there.

And how did we do? You'll just have to tune in to find out.

SALLY’S DAUGHTER MADELINE SAYS:

I’ve wanted to go on University Challenge for as long as I can remember. So when my college team failed to make it past the heats, I was naturally disappointed.

Sensing mediocrity, my ever-pushy mother nagged until I agreed to fill out an application to go on Mastermind — the Robin to University Challenge’s Batman.

Some parents seem determined their children will go to a particular school or become a rocket scientist, but in our family it’s all about quizzes. She even entered herself, presumably for moral support.

Sally and Madeline will both be seen on our TV screens soon in the infamous Mastermind chair

I was invited to London for an interview and to answer a few general knowledge questions. I assumed it was a lost cause, thanks to the football question I’d undoubtedly got wrong (pretty sure Arsenal don’t play at Stamford Bridge), and I kicked myself for forgetting the word ‘quango’ under pressure.

Still, no doubt the BBC had gender diversity quotas to fill — I got on to the show.

Sadly, the top two possible specialist topics I’d hoped to do, Harry Potter and Jane Austen, had been chosen in recent years, which was a huge disappointment.

As a child, I read and re-read the Harry Potter books while the other children went to birthday parties. As for Jane Austen, I just wanted an excuse to revisit Colin Firth in a wet T-shirt.

In the end, I opted for the novels of E. M. Forster and spent weeks mugging up, though I kept avoiding his longest, most complicated work, A Passage To India. I then had to read and learn the entire book the day before filming.

On the day itself, I opted for a loose, white polka-dot shirt and jeans. Mum nagged me to wear something smarter, but I was dressing for comfort.

My grandma and best friend, Eliza, came along for support and tested us both as we drove to the BBC studios in Salford. We were fitted with microphones and herded into the main studio, which was awash with cameramen, lighting technicians and spectators.

When John Humphrys appeared, the lights dimmed and the quizzing began.

Watching other contestants before me was the worst bit. I was so nervous when the guy in front of me finished that I started walking to The Chair before my name was called. Cue laughter from John Humphrys and the audience, and an embarrassing re-take. On my way back, the mic fell out of my jeans, and had to be refitted in front of everyone.

But when I got in The Chair, something marvellous happened. I found that the mic incident, while mortifying, had released a lot of tension, and I felt almost relaxed.

Both sets of questions went surprisingly well. The other contestants answered on The Battle of the Somme, the band Joy Division and The Big Bang Theory (the TV show, not the beginning of the universe). I got lucky with what felt like the easiest general knowledge questions, but still managed to give an unbelievably thick answer to a question about jewellery.

When we finished, John Humphrys strode off before I got a chance to speak to (i.e. take a selfie with) him.

Will I get another opportunity? That’s one question I can’t answer just yet...

Sally Jones will appear on Mastermind on BBC2 tomorrow at 8pm; Madeline’s appearance is on Friday, February 6, at 8pm.
