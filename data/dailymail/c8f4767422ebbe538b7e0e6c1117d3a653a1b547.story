Have you ever wanted to see what lies at the bottom of the sea?

Well, now you can, thanks to a live stream provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

They’ve unveiled the real-time video footage from a new deep-sea mission, letting you ride along for the rest of the expedition.

Last week the Okeanos Explorer vessel set out on its expedition.

Until 1 May it will be mapping and observing a region in the Gulf of Mexico. Here it has also been deploying a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named Deep Discoverer.

This is the third part of a 59-day expedition that is gathering data from areas of special interest on the sea floor identified by the scientific community.

February 24 – Leg 1 mapping transit from North Kingstown, Rhode Island, with transit mapping operations conducted en route to the Gulf of Mexico.

March 4 – Primary mapping operations started at the southwest Florida Escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico.

March 15 – Leg 1 in Galveston, Texas concluded.

March 19  – The Okeanos Explorer departed Galveston to begin Leg 2.

March 20 – Started primary Leg 2 mapping operations in the Northwest Gulf of Mexico.

April 3 – Concluded Leg 2 in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Mobilized for Leg 3.

April 10 – Depart Pascagoula and commenced transit to the Northwest Gulf of Mexico operating area.

April 12 – First Leg 3 remote operating vehicle (ROV) dive.

April 24 – Last ROV dive in Northwest Gulf of Mexico. Commence transit to West Florida Escarpment.

April 26 – First ROV dive at the West Florida Escarpment.

April 31 – Last ROV dive of Leg 3.

May 1 – Ship arrives in St. Petersburg, Florida; Leg 3 ends.

These areas are being mapped by the Okeanos Explorer while the Deep Discoverer dives underwater to observe interesting features.

These will include cold seeps, deep coral communities, undersea canyons, shipwrecks and possibly also mud volcanos and brine pools.

‘Despite its importance to U.S. national energy, food, transportation and recreational economies, and decades of exploration; significant gaps remain in our basic understanding of the deep Gulf of Mexico,’ the NOAA says of the expedition on their website.

‘In recent years, scientists and managers have identified poorly known areas in the Gulf of Mexico that are larger than the states of Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island.’

‘The 2014 Gulf of Mexico Expedition continues NOAA’s efforts with partners to reduce the unknown by conducting baseline ecosystem characterizations to support a variety of research, management, economic, and educational activities.

The data collected by the expedition will, according to the NOAA, be used to provide  critical deep-ocean baseline environmental intelligence to governments, universities, corporations, non-governmental organizations and the public.

‘Our collaborative exploration approach utilizes telepresence technology to stream real-time video and data ashore,' the NOAA continues, 'allowing scientists, engineers, managers, and students to work together efficiently to characterize sites, learn from one another across disciplines, and share knowledge and new discoveries with anyone watching on the Internet.’

Via telepresence, live images from the seafloor and other science data will flow over satellite and high-speed Internet pathways to people around the world

The 2014 Gulf of Mexico Expedition is divided into three 'legs' that aim to map the sea floor using the Okeanos Explorer's deep-water mapping systems. The third leg started on 10 April and will continue until 1 May

The Okeanos Explorer, pictured, was previously a United States Navy Ship but in 2010 it was converted into an exploratory vessel for the NOAA

The NOAA's Okeanos Explorer Program has previously stumbled across remarkable finds such as this mid-19th Century wooden-hulled shipwreck that was found on the Gulf of Mexico seafloor in 2012
