Marco van Ginkel has paid homage to his AC Milan team-mate Nigel de Jong by posting a 'then and now' picture on his Instagram account.

The Chelsea loanee has dug out a picture of himself as a youngster meeting De Jong, who at that time played for Ajax.

And underneath, he posted a picture of the two of them playing together recently in the colours of Milan.

'First as a fan, now as my teammate @nigeldejong,' wrote Van Ginkel underneath his tribute.

Van Ginkel, 22, has made just four appearances for Chelsea since joining them from Vitesse Arnhem in July 2013 and moved to Milan on a season-long loan on Deadline Day back in September.

Since then, the Dutch midfielder has played in Serie A matches against Empoli and Udinese.

De Jong, 30, who has won 80 caps for Holland, played for Hamburg, Manchester City, Ajax and 68 times for Milan since moving there in 2012.
