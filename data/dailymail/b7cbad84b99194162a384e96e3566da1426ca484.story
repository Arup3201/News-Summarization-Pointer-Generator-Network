The Indian diplomat forced to leave the U.S. this week amid accusations of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her housekeeper has said she fears she may never get to be united with her family in the U.S.

Indian consulate official Devyani Khobragade was allowed to leave the country on Friday after a month-long dispute over her arrest and strip-search on suspicion of visa fraud involving her domestic servant.

She was granted full diplomatic immunity and allowed to fly back to India - just hours after charges were filed in court alleging she lodged false documents to obtain a visa for her servant and then underpaid her.

Devyani Khobragade, 39, has she that is very worried she will never be allowed to the return to the U.S. where her husband and two daughters continue to live

Khobragade, 39, has spoken to an Indian newspaper about her ‘immense stress’ at leaving behind her daughters - aged seven and four - in New York along with her husband, who is a U.S. citizen and works as an academic.

‘I wonder if I will be able to ever reunite with my family, my husband, my little kids. I miss them,’ she told The Sunday Express.

‘What if my children choose to study and work in the U.S.? What if I can never return to the U.S., which I cannot now. Does it mean we will never be able to live together as a family again?’ she said.

Khobragade told the newspaper that she plans to continue with her legal fight to clear her name, including attempt to have her case in New York officially dismissed in a federal court.

‘I know I am honest, and I will come out clean. But we do not know how much time it will take and for how long my family will have to suffer due to this,’ she added.

‘I have come to India but my stand still needs to be vindicated. And of course, I have been separated from my family, and I am under immense stress for my children,’ she said.

‘I spoke to my kids for hours last night, and they are already missing me. The four-year-old asked me, “Mommy, when will you be back home”, and I had no answer.’

Khobragade was charged on Thursday by a federal grand jury in Manhattan with visa fraud and making false statements in a case that has triggered an outcry in India.

She's accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper.

The indictment said Khobragade had made multiple false representations to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a personal domestic worker. 

Khobragade, 39, is accused of exploiting her Indian-born housekeeper and nanny, allegedly having her work more than 100 hours a week for low pay and lying about it on a visa form

Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York

She planned to bring the worker to the 
United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General
 of India in New York, according to the indictment.

Khobragade,
 39, India's deputy consul general in New York, has maintained her 
innocence to accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 
per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage.

Her
 arrest last month sparked outrage in India after revelations that she 
was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants 
before being released on $250,000 bail.

In
 a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an 
arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic
 immunity status to leave the United States.

The
 letter said the charges will remain pending until she can be brought to
 court to face them, either through a waiver of immunity or her return 
to the U.S. without immunity status.

'We
 will alert the court promptly if we learn that the defendant returns to
 the United States in a non-immune capacity, at which time the 
government will proceed to prosecute this case and prove the charges in 
the indictment,' the letter from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet 
Bharara said.

Devyani Khobragade was arrested last 
month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her 
housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour

In an 
unusual statement last month, U.S. Attorney Bharara responded to 
what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case 
by saying Khobragade was accused of creating false documents and lying 
to the U.S. government about what she was doing, including hiring a 
housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was 
contracted to work.

He also 
questioned why there was ‘precious little outrage’ about the treatment 
of the Indian housekeeper Sangeeta and her husband Philip Richard while there was so much about 
the alleged treatment of Khobragade.

He
 said his office's sole motivation was to uphold the law, protect 
victims and hold lawbreakers accountable, ‘no matter what their societal
 status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are'.

These
 developments came as it was revealed that a lawsuit filed months ago on 
behalf of the housekeeper alleged poor working conditions.

Philip Richard had filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in 
July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. 

Mr Richard also said the consular 
official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family 
saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug 
charges.

In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com,
 a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani 
Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions 
or keeping a person in bondage.'

The
 petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family 
several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire 
consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get 
them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.'

Mr
 Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in 
front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of 
what the woman took.

Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also 
wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and 
wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go.

Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, 
because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on 
foreign soil'.
