Lewis Hamilton fastest in Russian Grand Prix practice

Lewis Hamilton quickly found himself at home around Sochi's Olympic Park on a day when Formula One attempted to get back to business in the wake of Jules Bianchi's accident five days ago.

The 29-year-old Briton, with the teams switching to the faster soft-compound Pirelli tyres in the afternoon session after running mediums in the morning, posted a lap of one minute 39.630 seconds.

Remarkably, it was McLaren's Kevin Magnussen and not Nico Rosberg second on the list, albeit 0.864secs adrift, followed closely by Ferrari's Fernando Alonso.

Rosberg, quickest in the morning run, had to settle for fourth, just over nine tenths of a second off of Hamilton's pace.

Latest on Jules Bianchi

Jules Bianchi’s father has revealed there is no change in his son’s condition as he continues to fight for his life in hospital.

Bianchi’s brother Tom and his sister Melanie arrived at the Mie University Hospital late on Thursday where the Frenchman is being treated for a severe head trauma sustained in last weekend's rain-lashed Japanese Grand Prix.

His British-based team confirmed earlier on Friday that they will only enter one car for this weekend’s inaugural race in Russia out of respect to the 25-year-old and his family.

Bianchi was diagnosed with a diffuse axonal injury to the brain – whereby damage is widespread rather than localised in one particular area – after he ploughed into a recovery vehicle sent out to retrieve Adrian Sutil’s Sauber during the latter stages of Sunday's race.

Hamilton insists he'll speak to Mercedes over new deal

Lewis Hamilton is adamant he will sit down with Mercedes at the end of the year to discuss a new deal as rumours regarding the prospect of Fernando Alonso taking his seat in 2016 gather pace.

In Japan last week the driver merry-go-round began in earnest, with Red Bull confirming four-time champion Sebastian Vettel would be leaving the team.

Although his destination has yet to be officially announced, Vettel is replacing Alonso at Ferrari as Red Bull team principal Christian Horner let the cat out of the bag on that score.

Lotus agree Mercedes deal

Lotus have confirmed they are to run Mercedes power units from 2015.

The long-term supply arrangement comes as no surprise as Lotus have long been linked with a switch to Mercedes.

The deal brings to an end a long-standing agreement with Renault, who recently made clear Red Bull were their number one team, effectively pushing Lotus to one side.

The agreement means Mercedes will again be supplying three teams in 2015 - Williams, Force India, along with Lotus - as well as running their own works programme.

Lotus have announced a deal to use Mercedes engines next season, ending their relationship with Renault
