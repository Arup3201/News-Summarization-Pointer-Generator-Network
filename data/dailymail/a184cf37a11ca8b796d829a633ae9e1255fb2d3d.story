Johnny Weir is reportedly back with estranged husband Victor Voronov despite a nasty divorce battle that had been publicly escalating since February.

Voronov says the divorce is off and Johnny may move back into their home, but only if the figure skater agrees to publicly apologize, reports TMZ.

The agreement also stipulates that Weir's mother Pamela must butt out of the couple's private life and personal finances.

Are happy days here again? Johnny Weir and his estranged husband Victor Voronov have reportedly agreed to reconcile, but only if Weir pledges to publicly apologize to his attorney husband

According to the report, Weir was planning to move back into their home as early as Monday but the couple were seen bickering over their own reconciliation agreement.

Come a long way: Voronov snapped this picture of a bite mark Weir allegedly left on hjis arm during an especially heated fight prior to the divorce filing

Weir filed for divorce from Voronov, whom he married at the end of 2011 after just months of dating, in February while working as a commentator for NBC at the Sochi Olympics.

The split has sparked a series of bitter digs - from Weir claiming Voronov destroyed his beloved Birkin bags, and Voronov claiming his ex sent text messages to gay porn star Michael Lucas and engaged in threesomes.

Most recently, Voronov accused his estranged husband of sending a 'hateful' and 'disgusting' email and filed court papers saying Weir had violated a temporary restraining order by sending the email.

'Johnny sent Victor a disgusting, 
hateful email which violated the no contact order as part of the 
temporary restraining order he got last week,' a source told Radar.

Voronov had the restraining order put 
in place after an incident on March 5 in which Weir allegedly hit him on
 the arm and threw a wooden Russian doll at him.

'So
 on Monday, Victor filed a police report with cops in Rutherford, New 
Jersey,' the source added. 'Johnny could be in very serious legal 
trouble if the judge finds him in contempt for violating terms of the 
temporary restraining order.'

Voronov,
 29, claims Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - including an 
affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner. He also says Weir is 
holding their dog Tema hostage.

Nasty divorce: Weir said he was not concerned about his ex sharing naked images of him following the split. He claimed Voronov physically and emotionally abused him

In legal documents obtained by TMZ, Voronov alleges Weir forced him out of the closet and that he married him because his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would make compelling reality TV.

In addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims the Olympian took from him.

These include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balenciaga bags, one green and one orange Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags.

Petty squabbles: The couple's bickering revolved around ownership of designer bags and other valuables including a Faberge egg. Voronov at one point claimed his figure skater husband held their dog Tema hostage

The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations.

In an interview with Access Hollywood, Weir made his own swipes at his ex, claiming his non-practicing attorney husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money.

He claimed he was struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner.

'Sochi was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in.

'My husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.'

Olympic favorite: Weir was a hit as he commentated on the Sochi Olympics with Tara Lipinski earlier this year - but he has said that behind the scenes he was struggling with his demanding husband

He added that their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police.

A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm.

Weir officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality.

On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov.

But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery.

'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'
