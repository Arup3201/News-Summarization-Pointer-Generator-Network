Ryanair is known for its budget flights and hidden charges – but new footage has revealed what passes for inflight entertainment on board its aircraft.

This 50-second video, filmed on board a flight to Ibiza, shows passengers singing the theme to the Dambusters while doing the actions of a plane as the flight descends.

Once the plane lands, cheering erupts and the crowd begins chanting 'here we, here we, here we f*****g go' as they roll down the runway.

The crowds on board the Ryanair flight to Ibiza started chanting as the plane came in to land

Other passengers in the background on the flight from Prestwick Airport look anxious and agitated at what is happening just rows in front of them.

Cabin crew can also be seen looking on helplessly as the singing goes on uninterrupted.

The rowdy flight flew on a Saturday afternoon last month but film of the obscene shouting has only just emerged.

Passengers began filming the rowdy holidaymakers as they sang 'here we, here we, here we f*****g go'

A passenger, who refused to be named, said: 'This comes as no surprise to see this kind of footage appear.

'This Saturday flight is notorious between passengers and cabin crew alike.

'I was flying back from Majorca with Ryanair last month and got talking to the air stewardess.

'I asked if she enjoyed her work and she said yes but then admitted she was dreading her shift on Saturday afternoon which was a flight to Ibiza from Prestwick.

'It is well known that these flights are a nightmare with all sorts of stories about outrageous behaviour taking place on them, including planking over seats as the plane comes into land.

'There can't be anybody in the industry who enjoys working them.'

Tom Lucas, a sports psychologist who has worked with high-profile stars from Celtic and other football clubs, called for Ryanair to take action against unruly passengers.

Mr Lucas, of Glasgow, complained to the airline last year after a fight broke out on his flight to Ibiza and one drunken passenger wet himself in his seat.

While some holidaymakers join in with the singing, other look on helplessly or try to ignore the noise

He said: 'Ryanair have rules and regulations but rarely seem to enforce them

'They will only do something about this when something really serious has happened.

'The staff sometimes make the situation worse by selling drink to people who are already out of it. Our flight ran out of drink, a man wet himself and a fight broke out.

'What kind of way is that to behave on an aeroplane? It's a disgrace and something should be done about it.'

A Ryanair spokeswoman said: 'We regret the unruly behaviour of this small group of customers over a brief period as this aircraft was on approach to Ibiza last month. 

'However, our cabin supervisor spoke to the group shortly after landing and they apologised and assured her that it would not be repeated. This group has since returned to Glasgow Prestwick without incident.'

The rowdy flight actually landed in Ibiza last Saturday, but footage has only just been posted online

Last September a plane was forced to make an emergency landing after a group of drunken Scots sparked chaos on a Ryanair flight from Prestwick Airport to Ibiza.

Police said 14 men had been thrown off the plane at Beauvais airport north of Paris and questioned by authorities.

French police claimed the group were so inebriated they thought they had landed in Ibiza when the aircraft touched down in Paris.

Their antics became so out of control the pilot alerted French air bosses that he would be making an emergency landing and diverted to Beauvais carrying 174 passengers.

Just weeks before another Ryanair flight saw up to 30 men run amok on a flight to Ibiza from Prestwick.

They guzzled spirits, jumped on seats, shouted, swore and threatened crew and passengers.

Spanish police were called on to the flight when it landed and it is understood they removed five members of the group.
