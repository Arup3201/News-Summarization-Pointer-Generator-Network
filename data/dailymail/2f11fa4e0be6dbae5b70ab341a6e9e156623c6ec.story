Michail Antonio’s late header salvaged a point for Forest and maintained their unbeaten start to the Championship campaign.

Stuart Pearce’s men will be disappointed with a draw when a win would have taken them top but grateful for a point after trailing to Daryl Murphy’s double strike.

Ipswich made their attacking intentions clear from the kick off, playing three men up front. And they got their reward when Murphy gave them the lead in the 19th minute with his fifth of the season.

The game looked won for Ipswich but a late Michail Antonio header gave Forest a share of the spoils 

Nottingham Forest (4-4-2): Darlow; Hunt, Mancienne, Wilson (Lascelles 29), Lichaj (Harding 81); Burke (Paterson 75), Tesche, Lansbury, Antonio; Assombalonga, Fryatt

Subs not used: De Vries, Veldwijk, Grant, Osborn

Goals: Murphy (19, 71) 

Ipswich Town (4-1-4-1): Gerken ; Parr, Chambers, Berra, Mings; Williams (Bishop 61), Skuse, Hyam (Tabb 33); Murphy, McGoldrick (Smith 76), Sammon

Subs not used: Bialkowski, Bajner, Bru, Henshall 

Goals: Tesche (63), Antonio (90)

It was a superb solo effort from the 31-year-old who glided down the right flank and cut in past both Eric Lichaj and Kelvin Wilson before curling the ball into the corner of the net.

The Irish midfielder had already served Forest notice of his threat heading an early effort straight at Karl Darlow before bursting into the box and onto Connor Sammon’s flick and blasting over the bar in 12th minute.

Forest had their chances to take the lead prior to Town’s opener with Matty Fryatt the main danger. He missed out on a golden opportunity when teammate Britt Assombalonga took Chris Burke’s cross off his toes.

A minute later the ball did drop for Fryatt three yards out but he struck the post.

After quarter of an hour Ipswich left back Tyrone Mings made a vital tackle to stop Assombalonga in the visitors’ area and from the resulting corner Fryatt headed wide from close range.

The free flowing football continued into the second half with both sides pushing forward in search of goals.

Jonny Williams, making his first start for the Tractor Boys in his second loan spell their from Crystal Palace, looked impressive. His persistence was impressive in winning one corner and minutes later Henri Lansbury ended another of his runs with a clumsy tackle that earned him a booking.

At the other end Dean Gerken made a fantastic reflex save low to his right to beat out Michail Antonio’s snap shot from Jack Hunt’s cross.

But the Ipswich stopper was powerless to keep out then Forest equaliser soon afterwards. Lansbury floated a corner kick to the far post where German midfielder Robert Tesche rose unopposed to head powerfully home for his first Forest goal.

Forest could have taken the lead when Chris Burke’s wicked shot curled just wide instead it was Murphy who struck again.

Mings played a neat one-two with Tabb and whipped in an inviting ball that Murphy nodded home from close range.

The home side could have struck straight back but Christophe Berra cleared Antonio’s effort off the line before a flying Gerken denied Assombalonga from the rebound.

But Antonio was not to be denied and deep into stoppage time another Lansbury corner went to the far post and he powered home a header.
