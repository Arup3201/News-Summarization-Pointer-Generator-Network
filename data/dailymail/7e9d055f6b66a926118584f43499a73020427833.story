Nineteen years after the shooting death of a high school junior in Jersey Village, Texas, her boyfriend is being charged with the crime.

Christopher Stoernell, 36-years-old and now living in Michigan, was arrested last week and charged with murdering his then 17-year-old girlfriend Ruth Majewski.

The charges come after her family asked to have the case reopened two years ago.

Justice begins: Christopher Stoernell, right, was arrested and charged today for the 1994 murder of his high school girlfriend, then 17-year-old Ruth Majewski, left

'We thought that he killed her,' Ruth's father Richard Majewski said. 'And that’s what we thought all along. But I guess we didn’t pique enough interest at the time.'

Ruth died after going over to Stoernell's mother's home on September 30, 1994.

Five other teens were there, between the ages of 15 and 19, when they somehow came into the possession of a loaded gun.

The kids were playing around with the gun, and Stoernell allegedly pointed it at his friends and jokingly pretended to shoot.

Ruth was later discovered in a bedroom dead from a gunshot wound and her boyfriend was assumed to be with her at the time.

'He told law enforcement at the time that it was a suicide and/or an accidental shooting,' Sgt Eric Clegg of the Harris County Sheriff's Office told KHOU.

Ruth's case remained cold until her parents pleaded that it be reopened again two years ago.

The HSCO's Cold Case Unit took up the case, re-interviewing witnesses and analyzing old evidence, and found the evidence countered the self-inflicted gunshot theory.

This it the 18th case the unit has solved since it was formed in 2009.

Now Ruth's parents look forward to seeing the man they suspected all along stand trial. Mr Majewski hopes it will finally give them answers or a motive for their daughter's killing.

After being charged with Ruth's murder, Stoernell was released and is currently free on $50,000 bail.
