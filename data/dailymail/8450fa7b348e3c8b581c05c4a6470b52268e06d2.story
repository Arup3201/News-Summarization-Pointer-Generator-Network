An Adelaide woman allegedly high on meth crashed a stolen hire car while two children without seatbelts sat in the back.

The suspended driver rear-ended another car in North Adelaide on Friday night, and police drug tests showed she was on methamphetamine, police say.

Two children under the age of five were unrestrained in the back seat, and were taken to the Women's and Children's Hospital with minor injuries.
