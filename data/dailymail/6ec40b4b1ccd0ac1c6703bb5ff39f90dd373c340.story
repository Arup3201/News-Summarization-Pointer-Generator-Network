Rant: Claire Moloney was filmed having a screaming argument with an Asian man on a Tube carriage after going out drinking with colleagues

A commuter who told an Asian man to ‘f*** off back to your own country’ in a rant on a Tube train has been found not guilty of racial harassment .

Accountant Claire Moloney was allowed to sit with her family while the verdict was announced.

A gasp of relief was heard when she was pronounced not guilty, and her husband put his arms around her and gave her a hug.

One family member was heard to say, 'About time.'

Mrs Moloney said during her trial that she was embarrassed to watch film footage in which she screamed at an unidentified man, and which was later uploaded to YouTube, and shown to the court at her trial.

The jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court also decided she did not intend her words to cause harassment, alarm or distress.

In the video, Moloney told the commuter, an Asian-looking man: ‘I f****** respect 
people in their countries, f*** you c***.’

She
 stood up in her seat, saying: ‘You come in this country, you wanna have
 f*****g everything on a plate. F*** off back to your own country if 
your country is so good.’

Moloney,
 who works in Central London, was travelling to her 
home in Dagenham, Essex, on a District Line train after going for drinks with 
colleagues, the court heard.

When
 the alleged victim told her that she was being racist, she replied: 
‘You c**** wanna take over our country, you racist c***, you wanna take 
over the world.’

The man remonstrated but was taken aback when Moloney got out of her seat to hurl more abuse.

By the end of the video, the victim had given up arguing and told her, ‘OK, I’ll go back to my country.’

Moloney, 40, sobbed and fell in to the arms of her husband in the public gallery as the jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court read out their verdicts.

The mother-of-two denied she was racist, saying 
she was upset at being told she had 'blood on my hands' and being 
criticised because she had been drinking alcohol.

‘I’m not a racist in any shape or form,’ she told the court in her evidence.

‘I agree the language is horrific and I am mortified.

‘I was half asleep and he said something to do with my poppy and I wondered if it was about me.

‘He said something about blood on my hands for invading his country.

‘I know what he said was derogatory 
and against women in general and he definitely used the word “Slag” 
because I was out drinking.

‘I was insulted and I lost it and I ranted; I was arguing my case.’

‘I was in a rage, I lost control and I was ranting but he was goading me.’

It
 was suggested to Moloney that the man was at a ‘point of surrender’ but
 she said: ‘I do not think so. He was being sarcastic.’

Under cross-examination she claimed to regret not attempting to leave the train or reporting the abuse.

However,
 she did say she would have reacted had anybody of any race made 
comments like the ones the unidentified Asian man had made.

Row: Moloney says she was provoked by the man and is now embarrassed by what she said at the time

The video was first uploaded to YouTube in November 2010, but Moloney was not arrested until April this year on suspicion of racially aggravated assault. 

Christoper Draycott, prosecuting, 
said: ‘Quite clearly these words would cause harassment, alarm or 
distress and so they did cause that.

‘The
 defendant is up out of her chair and leans into his personal space and 
he appears to lean back in his chair. Having argued back and 
remonstrated with her, he says, “Alright I agree with you, I will go 
back home."

‘Despite
 initially arguing back and not walking away he was caused harassment, 
alarm or distress. At least in part this incident was racially motivated
 and was put to him because of his membership of a particular racial 
group.’

Moloney left court having pleaded not guilty to one count of
 using racially aggravated words to cause harassment, alarm or distress 
and one count of intentionally using words to cause harassment, alarm or
 distress.
