Messages: Konstandinos Erik Scurfield kept in touch with friends through Facebook

Messages from the first Brit to be killed fighting ISIS have revealed frustration at the Kurds' lack of discipline - and his fear the 'Corps' would tell his mother he had gone to Syria.

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, who died while fighting against the terror group with the Kurdistan People's Protection Units (YPG), kept his friends updated through Facebook after heading to war-torn Syria in December.

The former Royal Marine's posts and messages give a glimpse of day-to-day life for those fighting ISIS, advises interested friends on how to join up and reveals the Kurdish fighters lack of discipline, but huge determination.

But it seems he was most worried about his mother finding out where he was.

The messages, published by The Sun, reveal Mr Scurfield began looking for a way to get out to Syria to join up with the YPG at least a month before he arrived in Syria.

He was recruited by the Lions of Rojava, and by November 3 had clear plans in place for reaching their base in Syria.

On December 6, using a Facebook account set up under a fake name so his friends could keep in touch, he messages to say he has arrived safely in Syria, and met up with two other foreign fighters.

But his parents still apparently had no idea where he was - with Mr Scurfield, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, revealing on December 15: 'I've heard about the authorities threatening to tell my parents!'

It is thought the 25-year-old told his friends he was going to do humanitarian work in the war-torn country last year after being 'horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS'.

It is unclear what Mr Scurfield told his parents,  archaeologists Chris and Vicci.

Eventually, it seems the Royal Marines did take matters into their own hands, informing his parents sometime between Christmas and January 5.

In his final Facebook post, Mr Scurfield, who was an expert in battlefield medicine, revealed: 'The Corps told my mum and I think she's taken it pretty well, I might even think she is a little bit proud.'

The messages and posts also give an idea of what foreign fighters heading for Syria to fight with the YPG can expect.

Mr Scurfield revealed 'quite a lot of Westerners' pack up and leave after a short time, disappointed by the Kruds' 'skills and drills'.

But Mr Scurfield was impressed by the attitude of the Kurdish fighters - who are the only troops on the ground fighting

'The Kurds don't do stuff like us but they never drip about going on patrol,' he wrote.

Mr Scurfield's messages also reveal he was waiting for fighting to intensify once more, which would happen in February and March, after the winter came to an end.

But then there is silence from the former soldier, and nothing more is thought to have been heard by friends, who were told this week he died on Monday was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli.

Friends, both in the UK and Syria, have paid tribute to him since. 

Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now  fighting in Syria, wrote: 'Words cannot describe how honored I have been to fight at your side Sehid Kemal (Konstandinos Erik Scurfield).

'We were together from his first day here and you couldn't ask for a more disciplined warrior.'
