A gang of teenagers kicked a 19-year-old to death after he joked that one of them looked like Justin Bieber.

Rikki Todd died four days after the attack when he was punched, kicked and had his head stamped on outside the Halfway House pub in Camperdown, Northumberland on December 23 last year.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how Rikki was beaten allegedly by Danny Scott and Jack Walton, both 18, after he had teased one of the boys from their group, ruffled his hair and said he looked like the Canadian teen popstar.

Accused of murder: Jack Walton (left) and Danny Scott, both 18, have been accused of murdering 19-year-old Rikki Todd (right) who was punched, kicked and had his head stamped on outside a pub last year

Graham Reeds QC, prosecuting said: ‘CCTV footage shows Rikki repeatedly ruffling the hair of a youngster who was part of the defendants’ group.

‘Rikki thought he had a passing resemblance to the Canadian singer Justin Bieber and, while drunk, thought it would be amusing to say so.

‘His attempts at humour irritated the boy and angered those who were with him.’

Scott and Walton, both of Seghill, Northumberland are on trial accused of murder. Both deny the charge.

Mr Reeds told Newcastle Crown Court on Monday how witnesses saw one of the attackers, allegedly Scott, knock Rikki to the ground with a punch.

Rikki’s head hit the pavement before he was kicked and stamped on.

Mr Reeds said: ‘Two witnesses remember Scott appeared to be particularly pleased with what he had just done.

‘He saw Rikki was now lying motionless on the floor and he shouted "I’ve knocked him out" or something similar and he lifted his hands in celebration of what he had done.

‘Almost immediately after the punch struck him, others in the group continued the attack.

‘A boy saw Jack Walton aim a kick 
which connected with the side of Rikki’s head and a witness says Scott 
stamped on the back of his head. 

‘Both were forceful and deliberate blows.’

Rikki, an apprentice heating 
engineer from Allanville, Camperdown, had been drinking with friends at 
the pub, playing pool from the late afternoon before a Christmas disco 
later that night.

After the
Bieber taunt, there was some minor pushing and shoving between the two 
groups and they were all asked to leave the pub, the court heard.

Drinking at the pub: Mr Todd was drinking with friends and playing pool at the Halfway House pub in Camperdown, Northumberland when the argument broke out. The boys were asked to leave and the attack on Mr Todd ensued outside

A confrontation started outside and Mr Reeds said at that point Rikki may have been looking for a fight.

They argued over what happened and handshakes were offered but refused, making tempers grow more heated.

Rikki squared up to one boy but ended up facing three or four teenagers, the court heard. 

Scott is alleged to have then pushed his way through the fracas and punched Rikki  to the ground where he was then allegedly kicked and stamped on.

Mr Reeds said: ‘The evidence shows 
the defendants were part of a group of three or four on one, and 
Scott pushed past someone else and launched a surprise attack.

‘His immediate delight at the result of his actions speaks eloquently about what he intended to do.

‘The prosecution say both defendants were part of a joint enterprise in attacking Rikki Todd in retaliation for his behaviour.’

Rikki was taken to hospital with a fractured skull but died in hospital four days later on December 27 after suffering bleeding and swelling of the brain. 

A post-mortem examination showed his head injuries were consistent with a heavy fall followed by kicks or stamps, prosecutors said. 

He also suffered a broken collar bone, which was consistent it with having been stamped on.

The trial continues.
