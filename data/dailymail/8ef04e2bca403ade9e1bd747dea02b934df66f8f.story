A 2-year-old girl was accidentally shot and killed by her 5-year-old brother while he was playing with a child-size rifle given to him as a gift, authorities in Kentucky say.

Caroline Starks, a blonde, blue-eyed girl, was fatally shot in the chest by her brother's .22-caliber rifle only minutes after her mother says she stepped outside their home in Burkesville on Tuesday.

The single-shot weapon fired is a rifle specifically marketed to children as 'My First Rifle' by company Keystone Sporting Arms, according to authorities.

Worst nightmare: Authorities say Caroline's older brother, pictured with her here, fired the single shot from his .22-caliber rifle called a Cricket, fatally shooting her in the chest

Killed: Caroline Sparks, 2, was killed on Tuesday when her 5-year-old brother accidentally shot her in the chest with his rifle

Tragic dwelling: The dilapidated home in Cumberland County, Ky, where a 2-year-old girl was shot by her 5-year-old brother

It was given to the 5-year-old as a gift last year, Cumberland County Coroner Gary White told the Lexington Herald-Leader.

'It's a Crickett,' White identified the weapon used. 'It's a little rifle for a kid. ...The little boy's used to shooting the little gun.'

'Accidents happen with guns,' he continued. 'They thought the gun was actually unloaded, and it wasn't.'

'It was god's will. It was her time to go, I guess,' Caroline's grandmother, Linda Riddle, told Lex18 on Wednesday.

'I just know she's in heaven right now and I know she's in good hands with the lord,' Riddle said.

Weapon: The 5-year-old boy shot dead his sister with a Crickett .22 caliber rifle (like the one pictured) that he was given a year ago

Tailored for youngsters: Keystone Sporting Arms also makes guns for adults, but most of its products are geared toward children. The smaller guns come in all sorts of colors, including blue and pink

Starting them young: Children fire rifles at a shooting range in pictures shown on the crickett.com website

The company, Keystone Sporting Arms, produced 60,000 Crickett and 
Chipmunk rifles in 2008, according to its website.

It also makes guns 
for adults, but most of its products are geared toward children. The 
smaller guns come in all sorts of colors, including blue and pink.

The company's slogan is 'my first 
rifle' and its website has a 'Kids Corner' section where pictures of 
young boys and girls are displayed, most of them showing the children at
 shooting ranges and on bird and deer hunts. The smaller rifles are sold
 with a mount to use at a shooting range.

The
 shooting highlights a cultural divide in the gun debate. While many 
suburban and urban areas work to keep guns out of the hands of children,
 it's not uncommon for youths in rural areas to own guns for target 
practice and hunting.

Controversial: The crickett.com website carries the slogan 'My First Rifle' and sells a range of weapons

Popular: The website has a 'Kids Corner' section where pictures of young boys and girls are displayed, most of them showing them at shooting ranges and on bird and deer hunts

Showing off: The 'Kids Corner' section has dozens of images of children and even babies (left picture, far-right image on second row) posing with rifles at home and on the range

'Down in Kentucky where we're from, 
you know, guns are passed down from generation to generation.

'You start 
at a young age with guns for hunting and everything,' White said on 
Wednesday.

What is more unusual than a child having a gun, he said, is 'that a kid would get shot with it.'

'The goal of KSA is to instill gun 
safety in the minds of youth shooters and encourage them to gain the 
knowledge and respect that hunting and shooting activities require and 
deserve,' the website says.

The coroner said the gun was kept in a corner and the family didn't realize a shell was left inside it.

It's 'just one of those crazy accidents,' White said.

Accident: The Cumberland County Coroner maintains that the girl's death was an accident as the child's family now mourns her unexpected loss

Heartbreak: The girl's grandmother said she's coping with the loss through religion while personally assured that she's gone to a better place

In
 a brief news release, state police said the shooting occurred when the 
boy was 'playing' with the rifle, but did not elaborate.

It is not clear whether any charges will be filed, said Kentucky State Police spokesman Trooper Billy Gregory.

'I think it's too early to say whether there will or won't be,' Gregory said.

An autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday.

Burkesville is a small town, with a population of just under 1,800.

Tragedy: The 2-year-old victim was transported to the Cumberland County Hospital in Burkesville, where she was pronounced dead

It is located in foothills of Appalachia.Â  The median household income in 2009 was estimated to be $17,747.

Bill McNeal and his son Steve McNeal decided to make guns for young shooters in the mid-1990s and opened Keystone in 1996 with just four employees, producing 4,000 rifles that year. It now employs about 70 people, according to their website.

No one at the company answered the phone on Wednesday.
