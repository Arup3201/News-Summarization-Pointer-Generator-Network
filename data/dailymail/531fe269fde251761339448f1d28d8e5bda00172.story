She is currently a favourite to win the contest after years of failed attempts to bring Eurovision back to the UK.

But Prime Minister David Cameron has admitted he has no idea who Molly Smitten-Downes is.

It is hardly a promising sign for the 27-year-old - whose own music teacher even says she won't win tomorrow's contest.

Molly, who will perform her song Children
 Of The Universe in Copenhagen on Saturday night, is going into 
the contest with the best odds Britain has had for years.

However, Cameron froze when asked if he knew who was representing the nation.

'The awful thing is, you've got me there, I don't,' he admitted in an interview with BBC Radio Suffolk.

He added: 'Is Terry Wogan still doing it? He was great, wasn't he? He still is great.'

Former host Sir Terry Wogan gave up the job in 2008 and was replaced by Graham Norton.

Asked whether he would be joining millions of TV viewers in watching Eurovision tomorrow, Mr Cameron said: 'Probably not, if I'm absolutely honest.'

The UK is hoping to improve its fortunes 
after two woeful years when veteran acts Engelbert Humperdinck and 
Bonnie Tyler were chosen and languished towards the bottom end of the 
voting table.

Unfortunately, Molly's singing teacher at Our Lady’s Convent School in Loughborough is not so confident.

Noel Henry, 54, said: 'I don’t think Molly will win unfortunately because I think the competition is too political.

'I think whoever sang for the UK would not stand a chance of winning but I certainly hope to be proved wrong with Molly.

1. Sweden (11/4)

2. Netherlands (3/1)

3. Austria (7/2)

4. Armenia (5/1)

5. UK (9/1)

6. Hungary (12/1)

7. Ukraine (14/1)

8. Greece (20/1)

9. Denmark (25/1)

10. Norway, Spain (33/1)

'I think if she comes in the top ten then that will be an incredible achievement and I wish her all the best of luck.

'If I could talk to her before she goes on stage I would just tell her to be herself and enjoy herself.'

Britain, like France, Luxembourg and Sweden, has won the contest five times and finished runner-up on a record 15 occasions.

Only Ireland has won it more times, with seven successes since Eurovision started in 1956.

In 1967, Sandie Shaw took the title for the UK with Puppet On A String, followed two years later by Lulu with Boom Bang-a-Bang.

It took another seven years before Brotherhood Of Man performed Save Your Kisses For Me in 1976 and brought the accolade back to the UK.

In 1981 Bucks Fizz won with Making Your Mind Up.

And the last time Britain was crowned winner was in 1997 with Love Shine A Light by Katrina And The Waves.

Before 1998, the nation only finished outside the top 10 twice.

Since then, however, the entries have been branded a 'national joke', finishing towards the end of the table year after year.

In 2003, 2008 and 2010, the acts finished last.

Molly Smitten-Downes has had her chances of winning cut dramatically after it emerged almost no radio station around Europe is playing her song

Every year, we write off our Eurovision song contest entrant as a no-hoper.

But this time round, it seems we have even less of a chance than usual.

Molly Smitten-Downes has had her chances of winning cut dramatically after it emerged almost no radio station around Europe is playing her song.

The 27-year-old, who will take to the stage in Copenhagen tonight with her ballad Children Of The Universe, is suffering from a media blackout in all of the key voting blocs, figures reveal.

It has not been played once in the past month in Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, Norway,

Poland, Romania and Switzerland, according to the UK’s official airplay compiler Radio Monitor.

In others, such as Estonia, Iceland, Latvia and Lithuania, it has been played only a handful of times.

In Britain the track has been played 2,346 times in the past 28 days, though most stations have played it only once or twice and it failed to make the Radio 1 playlist altogether.

And many radio listeners say they have never heard of Miss Smitten-Downes, who has been plucked from obscurity to represent us by the BBC.

Last night Ladbrokes had her odds at 9/1, with Sweden’s Sanna Nielsen the 11/4 favourite to win.

Third favourite is Austria, whose contestant is a bearded transvestite  who performs under the name  Conchita Wurst.

Miss Wurst, the alter-ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth, has upset some of the other countries taking part, notably Russia. But the singer said: ‘It’s just strange that a little facial hair causes that much excitement.’

Jemini's rendition of Cry Baby in 2003 received no points at all.

Molly will be the last act to perform on the night, with Eurovision experts saying it is a good position because the song will still be fresh in the memory as voting begins.

She landed her place in the final because the UK is one of the competition’s five big players who, along with the host nation, get an automatic place.

However Ireland, which has often performed well in the contest, have not been so lucky, with their entry, Kasey Smith, crashing out in the semi-final stages this week.

Austrian drag act Conchita Wurst - the 'bearded lady' - has got through to tomorrow’s finale, which will be broadcast live by BBC1.

Molly’s effort has so far failed to resonate with music buyers at home, with the song likely to achieve number 34 in the singles chart, according to latest figures from the Official Charts Company.

However, even that lowly placing is better than the past two efforts, with Tyler’s 2013 song failing to chart and Engelbert Humperdinck’s entry the year before only making it to number 60.

Bookmaker Hill is predicting the biggest year yet for betting on the contest as it predicts more than £1 million will be placed in stakes.

Spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'We have never seen so many bets on the Eurovision Song Contest - records could be broken and there is even a chance we will see a UK winner.'

Veteran singer Englebert Humperdink took a stab at the elusive title in 2012, but finished in 25th place

Since 1999, the UK has automatically qualified for the final, along with France, Spain and Germany, as they are the contest's biggest financial contributors.

However, the nation has since finished last three times.

In 2003, Liverpool duo Jemini received no points for their song Cry Baby.

Andy Abraham only received 14 points in 2008, coming last.

And Josh Dubovie crashed into bottom place with That Sounds Good To Me in 2010, which only merited 10 points.

Since then, big names have tried their luck at the title, but success has eluded them.

Boy band Blue managed to clamber up to 11th place with I Can in 2011, scoring 100 points.

But in 2012, veteran singer Englebert Humperdink finished 25th with just 12 points.

In 2013, Bonnie Tyler did little better, finishing 19th with only 23 points.

Many claim it is not the acts but the rules - and European politics - that have led to the UK's demise.

Only two British acts (Jessica Garlick, 2002, and Jade Ewen, 2009) have made it into the top five since the official body ruled countries do not have to sing in their native language.

Isolated from the rest of the continent, and notoriously sceptical about the EU, many feel the UK has been boycotted by mainland Europe.

In 2008, Sir Terry Wogan alluded to the politics that go in to voting, saying 'it is no longer a music contest'.
