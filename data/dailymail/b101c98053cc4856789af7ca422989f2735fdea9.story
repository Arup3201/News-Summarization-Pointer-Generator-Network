A heartbreaking video showing a father tenderly singing 'Blackbird' to his dying newborn son after his wife died in childbirth has gone viral.

Chris Picco took his guitar to baby Lennon James' bedside and is seen gently strumming the Paul McCartney song while his baby son lies in an incubator in the Intensive Care Unit.

The new father lost his wife Ashley just days earlier when she died unexpectedly in her sleep, before Lennon was delivered by emergency C-section at just 24 weeks in Loma Linda, California. Ashley was  30.

In a message to his friends, family and supporters, Chris wrote: 'My little fighter, Lennon James Picco went to sleep in his daddy's arms late last night. 

'He was surrounded by family, friends, and the best doctors, nurses and hospital staff in the world. He was dressed in an outfit that Ashley bought for him, with little guitars on it, and wrapped in a blanket made by a dear friend.'

The message continues: 'I am so thankful for the four unforgettable days I got to spend with him. His mommy would have been so beyond joy to see him and to hold him, touch him, bathe him, sing to him - as I have had the privilege of doing. 

'I have been so blessed and honored to love him before he was formed, to cherish him while mommy carried him, meet him face to precious face, and hold his perfect little body while we said "goodbye for now". 

'There are no words, but I wanted to keep you updated, as your love and support has meant more than anything in the world. All you need is love.'
