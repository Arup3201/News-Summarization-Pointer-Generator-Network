Workers going through donated clothing at a Monroe, Michigan thrift store turned up more than $43,000 in the pockets of suits and a robe and actually returned it to its rightful owner.

Goodwill manager Tyler Gedelian said that he sometimes finds loose change clothing, but nothing like what happened Wednesday at the Monroe store.

Stuffed in envelopes in the pockets were tidy stacks of $100 bills.

Good man: Tyler Gedelian, manager of the Monroe Goodwill store, found $43,100 in some donated clothing and returned it to its owners

Last gift: The neat little bundles of $100 bills were found in the pockets of a deceased woman and returned to her relative

‘We might find a quarter in somebody’s jeans,’ Gedelian told the Monroe Evening News. ‘But that blows my mind.’

Without even counting the enticing chunk of change, 29-year-old called police

‘My biggest concern was getting the money back to the rightful owner,’ he said. ‘I certainly can’t imagine losing that kind of money. I was so nervous having so much of someone else’s money.’

Police tracked down the man who donated the clothes. The newspaper reports that person was cleaning out an elderly relative’s closet and took the clothes to Goodwill.

The unidentified man said he had no idea there might be money hidden in them.

‘I am really proud of those people at Goodwill,’ the man said. ‘It makes me feel good there are people out there like that, especially in this day and age.’

Police arrived with no clue how much money was found and when Monroe police Officer Kris Joswiak arrived with a little plastic bag, Gedelian thought:

‘You’re gonna need a bigger bag.’
