A set of 62-year-old conjoined twins from Ohio are preparing to become the world's longest living duo as they hit a massive milestone this weekend.

Ronnie and Donnie Galyon, the oldest living conjoined twins, will overtake the age of their heroes, Thai twins Chang and Eng Bunker, as they turn 62 years, eight months and seven days on Friday. The Bunker twins died in North Carolina in 1874 aged 62 years, eight months and six days.

Then later this year, the duo from Beavercreek, Ohio hope to be recognized as the world's oldest ever conjoined twins as they reach their 63rd birthday.

Guinness World Records says the 
record is held by Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci, who were born in 
Italy in 1877 and lived to be 63 - although their exact date of death 
in 1940 is unknown.

Together: The men play a Nintendo Wii at the home. The brothers, born October 28, 1951, are hoping to be recognized later this year as the world's oldest conjoined twins, when they turn 63

The Galyon twins, who are joined at the waist and face each other, are throwing a party Saturday to mark overtaking their heroes, Mlive reported. 

They
 have four arms and four legs and separate hearts and stomachs but share
 a lower digestive tract, a groin, a rectum and penis, over which Donnie
 has control.

The
 twins were born healthy in Dayton, Ohio in October 1951 but stayed in 
the hospital for two years as doctors tried to figure out how to 
separate them. But when they said they could not guarantee both babies 
would survive an operation to part them, the parents said they would 
stay as they were.

The men agree that was the best decision.

'The good Lord made us,' Ronnie said. 'Let our savior do it.' 

Comfortable: A company in Michigan made the twins a bed - before that, they slept on top of each other

Visitor: Donnie, front, and Ronnie feed their dog, Mickey, inside their Beavercreek, Ohio home

Loved: The men live in a separate part of their brother Jim's home. He is pictured kissing Ronnie

From
 the age of four, the twins supported their family by performing in 
carnival sideshows in the U.S. and circuses 
throughout Central and South America. When they tried to return to 
school, teachers told them to leave because they were too distracting to
 the other students.

They continued their work at circuses in 
Central and South America where they performed magic tricks and were 
treated 'like rock stars', their brother Jim told Mlive.

They retired in 1991 aged 39 and moved to Beavercreek to be close to Jim, who is younger by 11 years.

In 2010, they battled poor health when Ronnie suffered a viral infection that 
caused blood clots in his lungs and Jim wanted them to move in with him, but his 
home was not handicapped-accessible.

A family 
friend contacted 
the Christian Youth Corps, which helped accommodate the house for the 
twins' needs, including a kitchen, wife hallways, oversized bathroom and
 shower.

They also received a custom-designed bed from Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which Ronnie said allowed him to 'sleep like a baby'.

Happy: Donnie, left, and Ronnie said they are glad their parents didn't opt to separate them as babies

Brothers: They admitted they get into arguments but also share hobbies such as fishing and baseball games

The bed is comprised of two backrests that face each other and let the men sit with their legs splayed out. It is far preferable to their days of sleeping on top of each other in a queen-sized bed, they said.

The updated home has meant that their health has improved dramatically in the past four years, their brother said. He says they no longer need help getting up and moving around.

He said that he and his wife love having his big brothers living with them.

'That's
 kind of giving it back right now,' he said. 'I don't do it because of that, but I 
feel that way. They paid for us all growing up.'

Mary added: 'A
 day doesn't go by that I don’t hear "I love you" and "Thank you". If you spend time around them, you can't help but love them.'

Younger years: The Galyons are pictured in their family's Dayton, Ohio on their third birthday in October 1954, after their parents decided they would never be operated on

They sometimes fight but also enjoy going fishing together as well as heading to baseball games, fairs and restaurants, which they can access on their customized wheelchair, their brother said.

While out and about, people often stare or approach them to ask questions, the men said. Some people have mocked them, but others have paid their restaurant bills and spoken kindly to them.

'You see the warmest of hearts, and you see the coldest of hearts, and a little bit in between,' Jim said.

Conjoined twins occur once in every 200,000 live births and the survival rate is between five and 25 per cent. They form when the developing embryo starts to split into two, but stops before the process is complete.
