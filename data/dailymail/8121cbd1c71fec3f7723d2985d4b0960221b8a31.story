British tourists are second only to Russians when it comes to nationalities Germans dislike most when on holiday.

A survey of 8,100 German holidaymakers carried out by German travel operator Urlaubstours found that Germans viewed the Russians and the British as both loud and all too often drunk.

In addition, the Germans complained in the survey that Brits in particular were rude and had poor table manners.

Too drunk?: A survey of German tourists found they considered Brits on holiday too loud and often drunk

Around 65 per cent of those polled said they'd had bad experiences with Russian tourists, followed in second by the Brits with 43 per cent.

Polish people ranked a distant third with 29 per cent for the same reasons as the Russians and Brits, for being too loud and too drunk.

In fourth is the Germans themselves, with 18 per cent citing bad experiences mainly because of a tendency to block the best sun-beds at resorts.

The Dutch were close behind with 15 per cent followed by US travellers with 14.6 of Germans claiming negative experiences.

They alsoÂ  also disliked the Chinese for lacking table manners and the French for being rude and unfriendly, the survey said.

Culture clash: Germans surveyed said they had negative experiences with Russians and Brits more than any other nations - they quite like the Swiss and Austrians though

But before you get the impression the
 Germans simply can't stand anyone sharing their space during time away,
 they quite like the Swiss - 96 per cent of those surveyed said they 
hadn't had a bad experience involving their neighbours to the south.

Another of their boarder-sharing nations, Austria, was next with 93 per cent followed by the Japanese with 92 percent.

In the same survey, German holidaymaker's fourth biggest peeve when on vacation is 'people who steal the sunbeds by reserving them with a beach towel before anybody else gets a chance'.

This backs up a recent online poll by travel site ab-in-den-urlaub.de that showed Germans had as little patience with sunlounger-hogs as Brits.

Calling dibs: A survey found that even Germans get annoyed when their compatriots reserve sunloungers

That survey's analysis added Germans 
were also irritated by their partners, hotel food, Russians again, 
getting up too early and noisy children when they were abroad, with more
 than three-quarters of those polled saying they spend their holidays 
feeling 'on edge'.

Germans take around 70million holidays a year as a nation, but are far from relaxed despite all their time off.

The survey found that most Germans abroad get upset easily - including 14 per cent who are annoyed by other tourists, mainly Russians, Chinese, Brits and other Germans.

But most of all, they fall out with each other - 58 per cent said they end up arguing with the person they travel with, whether it is family or friends.

Hotel food leaves 35 per cent of them seething, while 21 per cent cannot stand noisy children in their resort.

Chill out: A whopping 77 per cent of Germans feel stressed on holiday due to a range of factors

A further nine per cent resent waking up to blocked sunloungers - despite the humorous stereotype that it is Germans who place towels on sunloungers to reserve their spot.

Psychologist Bernd Kielmann, analysing the results, said: 'During their everyday working life, partners hardly see or talk to each other.

'During their holidays, they hang around together for days and don't have much to talk about.

'It is mostly not until their holidays that the partners' free time interests also turn out to be very different. So just one partner getting up earlier can provoke an argument.
