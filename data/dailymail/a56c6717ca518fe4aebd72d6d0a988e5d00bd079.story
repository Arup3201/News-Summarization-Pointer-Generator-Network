Britain's housing market is finally starting to cool with prices rising by just 0.1 per cent last month, banking giant Halifax said yesterday.

Martin Ellis, the bank’s housing economist, said there are signs of ‘an easing in the pace of house price growth’.

The slowdown in the housing market comes after rampant rises in house prices in many parts of the country, particularly London and the rest of the South East.

In 1995, just 186 homes in England and Wales were sold for £1million or more during the entire year.

By comparison, the Land Registry’s latest figures show a total of 1,028 were sold for more than £1million in April, a jump of nearly 40 per cent on the same month last year.

But yesterday’s figures from the Halifax show the housing market appears to be finally slowing down.

In May, house prices rose by four per cent, compared to only 0.1 per cent last month, it said.

The slowdown is a huge relief for young people trying to buy their first home at a time when wage increases have failed for many years to keep up with the rampant rises in house prices.

Mr Ellis said: ‘There are some signs of an improvement in housing supply, both in terms of more second-hand properties coming onto the market and increased numbers of new homes.

‘These trends, if sustained, should help to improve the balance between supply and demand, contributing to an easing in the pace of house price growth.’

He said the prospect of an interest rate rise ‘at some point over the coming months’ is also likely to curb demand.

The Bank of England governor Mark Carney will speak to delegates at the TUC today in a speech likely to address the explosive issue of low pay rises and rising interest rates.

The central bank has kept the base rate frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, but Mr Carney has made clear that the first rise for seven years is on its way.

Increases will be ‘limited and gradual’, he insists.

While house price growth has slowed, prices are still considerably more expensive than they were last year.

The average price of a home was £186,270 in August, but this is still just over £16,000 higher that it was in the same month last year.

Guy Meacock, from the buying agency Prime Purchase, said: ‘On balance the next few months will be the time to buy a home rather than sell.

‘Vendors who want to exchange by Christmas are coming to market at an unfashionable time of year and may need to be more flexible on the price if they want to meet that deadline.

‘Prices are already softening so there are good opportunities for buyers.’

Matthew Pointon, a property economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said buyers are ‘refusing or unable to stretch themselves much further.’
