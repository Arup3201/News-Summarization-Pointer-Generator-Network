James Bond's son is taking up government service, though not for Her Majesty.

This summer actor Pierce Brosnan's son Dylan Thomas is working as an intern in the office of Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat.

The 17-year-old is the oldest son of Brosnan and his American wife Kelly Shaye Smith, a former broadcast journalist.

Well-dressed family: Brosnan flew with his son to Washington, DC at the end of June and the two spent some time touring Capitol Hill before the start of Dylan's internship. Pictured above outside the Supreme Court

No special treatment: Brosnan and his son pictured with David Gregory of Meet the Press. A representative with Sen Markey's office says Dylan will be treated like any other intern 

Brosnan flew to Washington, DC with his son at the end of last month, and posted several photos of them touring the capitol on Instagram. 

In one photo posted on June 28, father and son stand outside the Supreme Court in bespoke suits.

The proud dad also posted a picture with his son and new boss Senator Markey at the World War II memorial.

However, a 
representative for Markey's office says Dylan will be receiving no 
special treatment this summer and will be spending the next two months 
doing 'everything interns do'.

'He's an intern like all our other interns,' Markey's spokesman Giselle Barry told the Washington Post, 'and we hope he is learning as much about the legislative process as all our other interns.'

Dylan seems to be taking the job seriously, sporting a clean haircut that's quite different that the long locks he was pictured with in 2012.

While
 Dylan is slaving away on Capitol Hill, his father will be spending the 
summer between the family homes in Malibu and Hawaii.

Changed man: Dylan Thomas was pictured with a much longer hair cut two years ago
