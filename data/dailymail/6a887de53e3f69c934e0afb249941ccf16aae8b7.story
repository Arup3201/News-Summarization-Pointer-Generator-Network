Four Tennessee teenagers fleeing from police after the murder of one of their fathers have been caught in rural South Carolina.

Police had been hunting for the three boys and a girl, aged 15 and 16, after finding Richard Blanchard, 36, dead from a gun shot wound in Tennessee. 

Mr Blanchard's 16-year-old son, Zack, is suspected of shooting him at the family's Greenville home at about 11pm on Wednesday.

Caught: One of the four teenagers is led away in handcuffs after nearly one day on the run

Arrest: Members of the sheriff's department lead two of the teenagers away in handcuffs

Afterwards, Zack allegedly tried to 
flee from police with his friends Liam Lawler, 15, Shelby Riley, 16, and
 Daniel Richards-Burchfield, 15.

Police believe the friends met Zack after the murder, and it is not thought that they knew of the killing in advance.

Warnings
 that the teenagers could be armed and dangerous were issued after 
detectives reported that nine weapons, including two AK47s, two shotguns
 and five handguns had been taken from Mr Blanchard's home.

Schools in the neighborhood where the teenagers were last spotted were ordered to be on alert, and parents were urged to be home to greet their children at the end of the school day.

'I would be concerned if I lived in the neighborhood,' Sheriff Lee Foster told WISTV when the search was still being carried out.

'We have a concern that this is a relatively quiet area. People still don't lock their doors, people leave their keys in their cars.'

Found: The friends, including Daniel Richards-Burchfield, left, and Shelby Riley, right, were caught on Thursday

When the minivan the teenagers are believed to have been driving was spotted in South Carolina, police used stop strips to trap it.

Helicopters,
 SWAT teams, about 80 officers and bloodhounds were used to track the 
teenagers, after they fled into woodland on foot. The dogs later lost 
the scent in a swampy region.

Police
 recovered the rifles and shotguns inside the wrecked vehicle, but the 
handguns were not found, leading to continued concerns that the group 
may still be armed.

The teenagers were finally caught after a strawberry farmer called 911 after recognizing the group of friends from wanted posters that had been circulated.

Manhunt: A huge search effort, involving the sheriff's department and SWAT teams, was launched

Getaway vehicle: A minivan allegedly used by the teenagers is hauled away after it crashed

Evidence: Police search the vehicle believed to have been used by the friends

They were arrested without incident, and one allegedly told officers that the remaining weapons had been dumped in a creek. 

Newberry County Sheriff Lee Foster told Fox Carolina it was unclear whether Lawler, Riley and Richards-Burchfield knew Blanchard was wanted for murder.

The teenagers were allegedly heading to Myrtle Beach, more than 360 miles from the murder scene, when they were caught.

Police said the teenagers used social media to communicate with each other after the shooting.

Stake out: An armed officer searches a property near where the group were spotted

Tactics: Law enforcement agencies coordinate their search efforts

Warnings: Police stopped traffic and released pictures of the suspects, who were believed to be armed

Foster told WISTV: 'They have no family in the area [where they were found]. They ended up here by flight and happenstance.'

Tennessee Bureau of Investigations will be dealing with charges relating to the murder of Mr Blanchard.

In South Carolina, the teenagers will face only one charge of allegedly failing to stop for law enforcement.

Tracking: A police helicopter gets ready to take off after the teenagers were spotted running towards woodland

Search: The sheriff's department track the friends in South Carolina
