Radamel Falcao was benched by Louis van Gaal for Manchester United's Barclays Premier League draw at West Brom on Monday night. The reason? 'Jet lag', according to the Dutchman.

The striker had travelled all of 6,760 miles during the international break to play in Colombia's friendly victories against Ecuador and Canada in New Jersey, so was deemed not fit enough to play at the Hawthorns. Fair enough, you might say.

But consider Sergio Aguero for a second. Manchester City's star striker travelled a whopping 12,214 miles to play for Argentina against Brazil in China and then watch his country's win in Hong Kong. That's nearly double the distance Falcao travelled - yet Aguero played against Tottenham last Saturday. He managed to scrape four goals too.

Also consider the fact that Aguero has also played more minutes over the past two weeks than Falcao too. Taking in to account the last Premier League matches before the international break and the first round of fixtures following it, Aguero has played 241 minutes for club and country. Falcao has managed just 220.

So was Falcao really too tired to start for United on Monday? Van Gaal told Sky Sports: 'I think Robin van Persie was (back) two days before Radamel Falcao came back and he was in South America. It's a big difference with jet lag and that's the reason he's out the team.'

Sergio Aguero has played more minutes in the last two weeks and travelled further than Radamel Falcao, but it was the Colombian who was benched for 'jet lag'.

But Aguero's stunning form would suggest that, if that is the case, then United's loan signing from Monaco might not be as fit as his South American counterpart or perhaps not as able to recover from long-haul travel. 

Consider, too, Hull midfielder Mo Diame. The Senegal captain did not enjoy ideal preparation for the Tigers' trip to Arsenal on Saturday. 

'Diame, he didn't come to the hotel until yesterday, he came straight from Heathrow to the hotel,' Hull boss Steve Bruce said after the match. 

Yet Diame scored at the Emirates Stadium and Hull managed to grab a highly creditable 2-2 draw. 

'You just have to go on a long-haul holiday yourself,' said Bruce when describing the effects of jet-lag on players and the mental and physical demands of travelling to play international football. 'You come back on a plane and you're physically knackered yourself. 

'You can't sleep, you can't do this, so to expect to come and play a game of football... 

'Diame had ordered about 20 tickets for today, so I thought to myself "he wants to play". He wants his mates and his family to see him.' 

Bruce's comments could suggest that Falcao was less enthusiatic about playing against West Brom than Diame was about facing Arsenal.

But even if this is not the case and Falcao simply was too tired to start for United, it must be concerning for Van Gaal to think he could be forced not to play his new signing after every Colombia match.
