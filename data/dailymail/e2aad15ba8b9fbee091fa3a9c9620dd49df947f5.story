A naughty puppy nearly made a real dog's dinner when she managed to turn on the gas hob, filling her owner's house with toxic fumes.

Jasmine the greyhound was home alone early this morning when she jumped up onto the cooker and hit one of the dials with her paw.

Owner Anthony Williams, 38, came home from working a night shift and immediately smelled gas.

He managed to dial 999 and get Jasmine out of the house but then collapsed from inhaling the fumes.

Fireman arrived and gave Mr Williams oxygen before he was taken to hospital by ambulance.

Mr Williams, of Cwmbran, South Wales, 
said: 'I'd been working all night and when I opened my front door, the 
smell of gas was very strong.

'I knew I had to get Jasmine out of the house and luckily she was fine.

'But I inhaled a lot of the gas and they took me to hospital.

'It was a bit of a scare for both of us - I will have to train her better.

'If she's going to turn the cooker on she can get me a meal ready for when I return home.'

Mr Williams, a petrol station worker, was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport by ambulance and treated for fume inhalation.

Back at home today he said: 'Jasmine is quite tall when she stands up on her back legs and she could easily reach the hob, but it never occurred to me that she might be able to turn it on.'

'She needs a lot of exercise to keep her happy. She is really clever, but she can also be a pain in the bum.

A spokesman for South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The gas cooker was turned on by the dog. The occupant received first aid including oxygen from the fire service before the arrival of the ambulance.'
