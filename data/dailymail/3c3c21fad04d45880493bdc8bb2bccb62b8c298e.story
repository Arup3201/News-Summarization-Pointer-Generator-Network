This was the farcical scene when a cat got stuck up a tree prompting a road closure involving seven firefighters, the police and RSPCA.

Emergency services were called when the ginger and white cat had been marooned up the tree for more than 48 hours.

A fire engine and a hydraulic platform were sent to the scene in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, along with a police car and an RSPCA inspector for the rescue operation lasting two hours.

Emergency: The cat was rescued in a major operation involving seven firefighters, police and the RSPCA

Rescue operation: The cat had been stuck up the tree for more than 48 hours by the time the emergency services were called

When the fire brigade decided to deploy their hydraulic lift,  the police car blocked the street to enforce a one-hour road closure.

Jane Hawkes, who lives in the road, said: 'The RSPCA had been called first and they called the fire brigade.

'They were worried the cat would fall so were there with tarpaulin ready to catch it.

'But every time they tried to get close, the cat would go further up the tree.'

Prepared: A fire crew waits at the bottom of the tree ready to catch the cat in case it falls

Scared: One witness said every time crews got near to the cat it went further up the tree

Miss Hawkes's husband Keith said: 'At first a member of the RSPCA was lifted with a member of the fire brigade to release the cat but this simply drove it further up the tree.

'After several manoeuvres of the platform an additional member of the fire brigade climbed a ladder into the centre of the tree.

'He managed to encourage the cat to the higher branches by the platform.

'It was then unceremoniously grasped from the tree by the RSPCA member and deposited safely into a cat basket.

Operation: Crews used an hydraulic lift in an attempt to get closer to the cat

Incident: The rescue operation took the emergency services more than two hours to complete

Success: The cat was eventually grabbed by a firefighter before being put into a basket

'A few minutes later the cat was reunited with its owners and taken home for some privacy and essential nourishment.'

Geoff Sallis, Gloucestershire’s deputy chief fire office, said: 'There is an agreement with the RSPCA that Fire and Rescue Services will assist with animal rescue high above ground.

'In this case, the RSPCA called us to help them retrieve the cat that had been stuck at a considerable height for three days, was becoming very distressed and dehydrated, and couldn’t get down by itself.

'Thankfully all ended well and the cat was reunited with its relieved owners.'

Safely down: The cat was swiftly reunited with its owners once it had been rescued

Star: The cat had sparked a lot of interest in the street after getting stuck in the tree
