Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew won’t win any prizes in penmanship, but his official signature that made its debut Tuesday on the nation’s currency appears slightly better than the loopy scrawl he had a few months ago.

Lew’s new and improved John Hancock was unveiled by the Treasury Department Tuesday in a tweet showing the evolved autograph at the bottom of a $5 bill.

It takes the Bureau of Engraving and Printing about 18 weeks to put new engraving plates into production. That means Lew’s signature will not show up on the various currency denominations, beginning with the $5 bill, until sometime this fall.

Lew’s unintelligible signature had been so bad that President Barack Obama joked that unless it improved it would ‘debase our currency.’

The new signature is still hard to read but it does represent an improvement from previous signatures that were essentially a series of loops. Lew became Treasury secretary, succeeding Timothy Geithner, on February 28.

While the signatures of Treasury secretaries have been appearing on the currency since 1914, Treasury chose a very modern way to release Lew’s signature. They tweeted it.

Treasury spokeswoman Suzanne Elio said
that Twitter was chosen ‘given the interest in the secretary’s 
signature and the attention it has received through social media.’

However, not everyone was pleased with Lew's revamped autograph.

Many Twitter users grumbled about the 
loss of his old whimsical signature, with at least one commenter 
claiming that his current John Hancock looks more like 'Paul J Fres' 
rather than 'Jacob J Lew,' The Washington Post reported.

When Mr Obama announced Lew’s nomination in January, he quipped that his pick for Treasury secretary would make strides to improve his zany signature.

‘Jack assures me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible in order not to debase our currency should he be confirmed as secretary of the Treasury,’ the president said at the time. .

Asked by NBC News to explain the change in Lew’s autograph, a Treasury Department spokeswoman would say only that it’s common for secretaries’ signatures to evolve once they start practicing for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

Lew's predecessor, Timothy Geithner, also changed his signature when he submitted it to be printed on currency notes.

Lew, who was appointed to the post 
earlier this year, created a media stir when his autograph - eight loops
that looked nothing like his name - was revealed as the one that would 
grace all American paper money.

But
in April, a document from the Financial Stability Oversight Council 
showed Lew's signature to be legible, with a more pronounced 'J' and 
'L.'

The change was first noticed by the Wall Street Journal.

It is not known whether Lew took any handwriting or calligraphy classes in order to improve his signature.

Lew
poked fun at himself over his springlike autograph in the past, saying that he and Timothy Geithner have both struggled with signage.

He
said that 'it was only yesterday that I discovered that we both share a
common challenge with penmanship.'

Geithner also modified his signature to make it readable on currency.

Lew, 57, was managing director for Citigroup from July 2006 until the end of 2008, when he joined the Obama administration as the president's chief of staff.

Improved: His signature, seen bottom right, showed his full name and was much more legible and controlled
