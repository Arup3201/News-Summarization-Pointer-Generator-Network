With the Champions League group stages getting underway on Tuesday night, Sportsmail's experts pick their Euro stars for this year's competition. 

MARTIN KEOWN 

Who will win the tournament?

The extra firepower of Robert Lewandowski and the added class of Xabi Alonso mean Bayern Munich are my tip.

Can the English teams compete?

Chelsea and City are best equipped, Liverpool will relish being back and Arsenal are desperate to win it for Arsene Wenger.

Which player will be the surprise star?

A few years ago it was Gareth Bale taking Europe by storm. Can Raheem Sterling do the same? Both moved in from the wing and both are so exciting — it’s Sterling’s time to shine.

MATT BARLOW 

Who will win the tournament? 

Barcelona. In a slight state of flux of the post-Pep years but in Messi, Neymar and Suarez they have three match-winners.

Can the English teams compete? 

Expect all four to progress, with Chelsea best equipped to go furthest. Manchester City’s tough group will take its toll with injuries, suspensions and confidence.

Which player will be the surprise star?

It will be some effort to eclipse Ludogorets defender-turned-keeper Cosmin Moti, but Sterling can leave his mark.

Lionel Messi and Barcelona will be hoping to improve on last year's run to the semi-finals

IAN LADYMAN 

Who will win the tournament? 

Chelsea — now Jose Mourinho’s team have a proper centre forward.

Can the English teams compete? 

Chelsea and City will both be in the last eight. Liverpool will struggle to reach phase two.

Which player will be the surprise star?

Ezequiel Lavezzi, Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic attract all the attention for Paris Saint-Germain but the Argentine is one of Europe’s most dangerous attacking midfielders.

NEIL ASHTON 

Who will win the tournament? 

Bayern Munich. They were crushed by Real Madrid last season, but that will only increase Pep Guardiola’s motivation. After that he will become the Manchester City manager.

Can the English teams compete? 

Of course. Chelsea are formidable and Diego Costa munches goals. Arsenal will bow out in March, City must go far and Liverpool can too.

Which player will be the surprise star?

Calum Chambers. Nothing fazes him. Watch out, Europe.

DOMINIC KING

Who will win the tournament? 

Real Madrid. Sooner or later a team is going to successfully defend the title.

Can the English teams compete? 

The most likely team to get there is Chelsea. They have the squad and the manager.

Which player will be the surprise star? 

Another vote for Sterling. The England winger will have a huge role to fulfil.

Will Real Madrid be celebrating another Champions League success this season?
