Sound familiar?

Only this time, it isn't Sarah Palin in the self-made spotlight, it's Michele Bachmann.

The Republican Presidential candidate
spent Saturday shaking hands in Iowa diners and strolling through a 
bustling farmers' market as she tried to capitalize on her early 
popularity in the state that kicks off the campaign season.

An Iowa native, the tea party 
favourite ranked nearly even with GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney in a 
recent poll of Republicans likely to participate in the state's lead off
caucuses next year.

But just six weeks before the state's
closely watched straw poll, the Minnesota congresswoman has done little 
to campaign or set up an organization here.

Beginning her first sustained 
campaign trip to Iowa as an announced candidate, Ms Bachmann introduced 
herself to audiences from Iowa City to Des Moines in a new campaign bus 
emblazoned with her name.

She spent much of Saturday posing for pictures and signing autographs rather than in meetings with key GOP activists.

After meeting about 100 supporters 
and politically curious Iowans at a stop in Marshalltown, Ms Bachmann 
told The Associated Press: 'I have every confidence our team is going to
deliver.

'I am going to be here in Iowa campaigning all through July'.

In Iowa City, Ms Bachmann met about 
100 weekend breakfast regulars and Republican activists at the Bluebird 
Diner near the University of Iowa.

Local resident Sheila Reiland told Ms
Bachmann's campaign chairman in the crowded diner that she signed up 
last week on Bachmann's website to volunteer but had heard nothing from 
any campaign staff.

Ms Reiland, a registered nurse who 
went to Washington, D.C., this year to attend a health care rally 
Bachmann headlined, said: 'She is my candidate, and I want to do what I 
can to help her. But I haven't heard anything back'.

Ms Bachmann's Iowa campaign chairman,
state Sen. Kent Sorenson, acknowledged having a lot to do in a short 
time since the Iowa Legislature was in session until Thursday.

But he told Ms Reiland: 'You will be hearing from us'.

Ms Bachmann met privately aboard her 
campaign bus with activists en route from Cedar Rapids, where she 
strolled through the city's crowded downtown farmers' market, to 
Marshalltown about 70 miles west.

She also planned to meet with GOP activists Saturday evening in Des Moines after headlining a tea party rally.

But her trip, which continues Sunday 
in western Iowa, was more about raising her name identification around 
the state, Mr Sorenson said.

Ms Bachmann had been weighing a 
presidential bid since January but only began raising money toward a 
campaign in June. On Saturday, she dismissed claims that she was 
scrambling to get organized in Iowa.

Ms Bachmann said she had been laying 
the groundwork for her Iowa campaign since last month, before she 
officially announced her White House bid last week in her childhood home
of Waterloo, Iowa.

In Marshalltown, campaign aides 
handed out supporter cards outside Taylor's Maid-Rite, a popular 
downtown lunch spot where about 100 people met Bachmann's bus. Standing 
on a platform next to the bus in the afternoon sun, Ms Bachmann asked 
residents for support.

She said: 'We need your help at the 
straw poll. Will you come out and help me? We'll bring around the buses.
We'll pick you up, whatever you need. We'll get you down there'.

'We need your help because winning back the White House begins in Iowa'.

Ms Bachmann stopped short of saying 
she expected to win the straw poll, an early organizational test of 
support that draws thousands of Iowa Republican faithful - and a heavy 
contingent of national political media - to Iowa State University in 
Ames on August 13.

But Ms Bachmann said she hopes her 
close second-place showing to national GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney in 
The Des Moines Register's recent poll of Iowa Republican caucusgoers 
makes her the favourite for the event.

Ms Bachmann plans to return to Iowa next week, aides said.

David Harris of Marshalltown was 
signing his supporter card and said he planned to go to Ames for the 
straw poll. The Republican said he had not participated in the caucuses 
for more than a decade, but said he was drawn to Ms Bachmann's 
popularity with tea party supporters.

Mr Harris said: 'She has an energy 
that's stirring the grassroots, people like me who have not been part of
politics for a while'.
