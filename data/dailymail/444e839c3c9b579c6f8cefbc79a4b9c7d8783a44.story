Hotels in the notorious party resort of Magaluf are set to kick out a record number of yob British holidaymakers this year.

Nearly 100 troublemakers have been asked to leave already this season for smashing up rooms, fighting with guests or assaulting staff.

And hotel bosses are promising to get even tougher with unruly tourists after the rowdy Majorcan resort made headlines around the world over a video of a British teenager performing a sex act on 24 men in a bar for free booze.

A local hotel association has revealed 92 of the 107 people members have kicked out so far this year have been British. The other 15 were Irish.

The shocking figures put Magaluf on course to break its record of expulsions, 254 last year and up from 147 in 2012 and 166 in 2011. 

The vast majority of those asked to leave in previous years, like this year, were British.

And around 35 per cent of the area's hotels do not belong to the association which released the figures today, meaning the real number is likely to be slightly higher.

Joan Espina, vice president of the Palmanova-Magaluf Hotel Association, which covers the two sister resorts, said: ‘The vast majority of the expulsions are down to three reasons.

A major events firm has announced it is pulling out of scandal-hit resort Magaluf.

Mallorca Rocks said this will be its final summer of running open-air gigs at its eponymous hotel in the party destination.

Andy McKay, founder of the firm's owner Ibiza Rocks Group, said: ‘our strategic agenda has changed and the time is right for us to move on at the end of the summer season.

‘We are really proud of what we have brought to the Mallorcan resort of Magaluf but we are pulling out of the resort in September.’

It is understood the decision to cease activity in Magaluf was taken before the furore broke out over footage of a 21-year-old Northern Irish girl performing a sex act on 24 men in a bar.

But it is likely to compound fears voiced by nightlife workers of an exodus by big tour operators following the controversy.

Managers, DJs, reps and bar staff, most of them British, claim that they have all been tarred with the same brush over the actions of one independent pub crawl organiser.

And they complained that local authorities are targeting bars that bring money to Majorca rather than tackling problems such as street prostitution and muggings.

‘The first is guests damaging hotel furniture, kicking doors down, smashing mirrors and even throwing TVs out of their rooms.

‘The others are fights with other guests and verbal and physical attacks on hotel staff.

‘The vast majority are always British men, aged between 18 and 25.

‘We want young people who come to enjoy themselves but within a context of respect towards other guests.

‘We won't tolerate people whose fun comes from antisocial behaviour which causes others to suffer.‘It's got to be fun within certain limits.

‘Virtually
 all the problems we're experiencing are connected to the misuse of 
drugs and alcohols and obviously we'd urge these youngsters to take 
care.’

Troublemakers are put on a temporary black list so hoteliers know not to accept them.

Mr
 Espina explained: ‘The association sends round an email with the name 
of the person that's been expelled so other members are pre-warned.

‘We cover 20,000 hotel beds in Magaluf and Palmanova so it is a very effective measure.

‘It's only information that's kept for a few days and not on a long-term basis.

‘Most
 of the people that are expelled for bad behaviour promise they won't do
 it again but we usually find a lot of them have already caused trouble 
before.

‘Where there's been vandalism hoteliers try to get compensation from those who've caused it but it's very difficult in practice.

‘Usually we try to avoid getting the police involved unless it's very serious.’

Several hotels in the area have hired private security to address the problem.

One hotel boss said: ‘It's not that the problem has necessarily got worse but more that hotels are taking a tougher approach.

‘In many cases hotels now employ external security staff rather than depending on a night-time caretaker and a sole security guard they mostly employed themselves.’
