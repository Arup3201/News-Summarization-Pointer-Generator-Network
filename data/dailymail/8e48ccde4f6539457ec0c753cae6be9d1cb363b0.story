Andy Murray earned himself the opportunity to gain some revenge for what happened at Wimbledon last year after an almost uninterrupted cruise into the last 16 of the Australian Open.

The world No 6 now gets a shot at gifted Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov after swatting away Portugal's Joao Sousa like he was one of the irritating flies one finds in these parts.

Murray took two hours and six minutes to overcome the world No 55 6-1 6-1 7-5, and now has a match against the player who knocked him out of last summer's SW19 quarter-final in straight sets.

The stakes will be even higher after the shock exit of Roger Federer at the hands of Andreas Seppi, as the world No 2 was due to be awaiting the winner in the quarter-finals.

Murray was, for the most part, in imperious form over on the Hisense Arena and played with real aggression. He will need to reproduce that positive outlook to get past world No 11 Dimitrov, who often draws comparisons with the great Swiss.

'It should be a good match, he has improved a lot over the last few years,' said Murray of a player who he beat when they last played, at the Paris Masters, indoors in November.

Murray was pleased with his afternoon's work: 'Joao came back into it and played some great shots at the end. My body feels good, although you know it's going to get tougher with every round.'

Dimitrov needed to summon up all his resolve to get past Cyprus's Marcos Baghdatis, and took a sapping three hours and 28 minutes before winning 4-6 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-3. Murray by contrast was in complete control bar a brief period in the third set, when his concentration slightly faltered at 4-1 up.

Murray's groundstrokes were often sublime however and left Sousa with little answer

He had needed to save an early break point in the third game of the opener, when he served two double faults. From then on he powered ahead, not dropping a further game in the first against Sousa, who needed treatment on his his upper leg when he went 4-1 down in the second. He looked in pain, but seemed to move well thereafter.

He could make no inroads, despite Murray's first serve percentage dropping to 43 in the second.

The Hisense Arena, a multi-sport venue, is not the most atmospheric, but the excitement levels rose when a revitalised Sousa mounted a fightback when his cause seemed lost. He broke back for 4-3 and, loudly exhorting himself, struck out with nothing left to lose.

Murray needed to reassert himself and, and remained admirably disciplined, even when two match points went begging at 5-4. He headed off the threat of a tiebreak with a final break of serve, and reaches the fourth round having expended the minimum of energy.

That is just as well for, even with Federer out, sterner tests are coming now, beginning on Sunday.
