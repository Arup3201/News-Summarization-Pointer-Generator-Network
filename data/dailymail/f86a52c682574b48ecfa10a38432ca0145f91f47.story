A couple's adventure touring the beautiful wildlife of Africa is set to be documented in a stunning new photobook. 

Kym, 53, and Tonya Illman, 47, from Perth, Australia, utilised remote controlled camera buggies, hidden cameras and quad-copters among other things, to portray African wildlife in different ways.

The couple have managed to join in with packs of cheetahs, wild dogs, elephants and one occasion grabbing the attention of a young lion for a photo Mr Illman calls the 'lion selfie'.

The couple's adventure touring the beautiful wildlife of Africa is set to be documented in a new book, this photo is called Elephant Trumpets and was taken in Tanzania

Kym and Tonya Illman utilised remote controlled camera buggies, hidden cameras and quad-copters among other things, to portray African wildlife in different ways, including this Impala relaxing at the Manyara Ranch in Tanzania

They plan to feature more than 140 of their finest images, along with the story behind each one, in Africa on Safari, a 204-page book launched on Kickstarter imminently.

'We carry more photographic gear on safari than almost anyone, except perhaps the BBC,' said Mr Illman.

'People (and animals) are most intrigued by our remote-controlled camera buggy though.'

The battery operated 4WD camera buggy was custom made to carry a Canon 5D Mark 3 camera with a 16-35mm lens. The pair use the buggy primarily on private game reserves or conservancies with the approval of the guide or game reserve manager.

Mr Illman said: 'Low and wide angle shots of wild animals are rare captures. Unlike normal shots taken from the roof of a vehicle, the horizon is low and the animal looks large as it approaches the hidden camera or buggy. People simply aren't used to seeing this perspective.'

The photographs, including this cheetah at a Lion Park in Zimbabwe, will be documented in a 204-page book set to be launched on Kickstarter imminently

The couple have spent more than 22 weeks in Africa over the past two years alone, photographing for the book and have got frighteningly close to an array of wildlife.

'We put the buggy out with a male lion one day but when it started raining, I drove it back to our safari vehicle,' said Mr Illman explaining the day they snapped the 'Lion Selfie'.

'Two sub adults saw it and followed it back. Not wanting them to damage it, I drove it under the vehicle hoping they'd depart. They didn't so Tonya quickly mounted a camera on a monopod and connected a remote shutter. I lowered the monopod through the open window and when the lion came closer and started pawing it gently, Tonya clicked the remote shutter - my lower hand just 50cm from its paw.'

The pair, who immersed themselves in photography four years ago, have also used a quad-copter.

'A number of aerial shots feature in the book, shots that many years ago would have been impossible to capture,' said Mr Illman. 

'Unfortunately, a couple of countries have limited the use of drones over the past 12 months so these shots will be harder to acquire in the future.'

Mr Illman's wife had been to Africa in the 90's but it took her two decades to convince him to join her on a second safari.

He said: 'Tonya thought I would love it but for decades I resisted. Then one day, she called me at work and said, 'I've decided we're taking the boys (then aged 10 and 12) on safari in South Africa. I've booked flights for the four of us; you can book the accommodation'.'

This lion's intrigue saw him get up close and personal to the camera, but unfortunately for her, it wasn't edible

Resigned to the prospect, Mr Illman scoured the net and, being a passionate photographer, bought a number of African wildlife photography books.

'I quickly became aware of the awe-inspiring photographic opportunities that a safari offered and decided I would embrace the trip,' said Mr Illman.

Since then the Illmans have shot more than a quarter of a million images and have settled on 143 of their best to feature in this large format book, Africa on Safari, to be published by London-based Papadakis Publisher and released later this year.

Mrs Illman added: 'A lot of our work requires two people. Kym can be a little disorganised and when you have 3,000 images to wade through at day's end, my organisational skills come to the fore. Having two of us shooting also allows one to shoot wide, the other tight, resulting in two different perspectives.'

The couple admit that with so many great shots to choose from, it's hard to leave certain shots out.

'We have an abundance of lion photos, we could do a whole world-class book on lions but we're having to jettison so many of them so it's not lion-indulgent,' explains Mr Illman.
