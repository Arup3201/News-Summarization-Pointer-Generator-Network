The parents of brain cancer boy Ashya King say they are scared of returning to Britain in case the authorities try to take their sick son away from them.

Ashya's father Brett, 51, said he asked his MP  to speak to social services so they can give the family assurances the five-year-old boy will not be placed in care on his return to the UK, but was told to 'keep out of the way'.

Mr King, who fled abroad with Ashya and his mother, Naghmeh, earlier this year to seek pioneering proton treatment denied by the NHS, says the family feel like 'refugees'.

Speaking to the Sunday People from the family's holiday home in Malaga, Spain, Mr King said: 'My local MP Mike Hancock has asked social services, "What would happen if the King family return to England? Would you involve yourself with them?"

'They haven’t been able to give a clear answer, so my MP said to keep out of the way for the time being.

'He said, "If anything happens, like your child grazes his head and you take him to the hospital, maybe social services will try and take the child away".

'It's like we're refugees. We're not happy here [in Spain], it's not our home. Our home is in England.' 

Earlier this month, Mr King claimed he was 'treated like a criminal' when he returned to Britain for the first time after fleeing the country with his cancer-stricken son.

He said Border Force officials took his and his older son's passports at Gatwick Airport and made the pair wait in a holding area while they phoned other authorities and called in two uniformed police officers - who later decided to let the father and son go.

Mr and Mrs King sparked an international manhunt when they removed  Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on August 28 without medical consent.

Under the belief that British doctors were not taking the best course of treatment for their son, they fled to Spain with the sickly boy in their care.

Police traced the couple to Malaga and arrested Mr and Mrs King, holding them in a Spanish jail at the request of British authorities.

Ashya was put in hospital under armed guard and was unable to see his parents for days. 

Then, in a dramatic turnaround amid a national outcry, the parents were told they would not face charges.

Their son was taken for 30 rounds of experimental treatment at the Proton Therapy Centre (PTC) in Prague and is now said to be 'improving every day' with the family in Spain.
