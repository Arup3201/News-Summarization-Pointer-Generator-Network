A mother who woke up from a coma had lost more than a decade of her memory and thought it was still the 1990s. 

Candace Emptage had been in a coma for six weeks following a car accident, when she woke up believing she was a 22-year-old woman. 

In fact she was 40 and was told she was mother to Maddie, then 14. 

'They told me I had a daughter and I just stared at them and said, 'what?'' Ms Emptage explained.

Candace Emptage woke up from a six week coma and thought it was the 1990s, she was 22 and the Spice Girls were number one. In fact it was 2010, she was 40 and mother to Maddie (right), who she didn't recognise

The former model was convinced it was still the 1990s - the decade when the Spice Girls were top of the charts with Wannabe and BSE was the latest health crisis to hit Britain. 

She said it was incredibly hard dealing with the fact she only had a fleeting image of her daughter at two and could remember nothing of her growing up, let alone recognise the girl standing before her in hospital.

Ms Emptage, a former model, lost control of her Toyota MR2 and crashed into the path of an ambulance near Rowlands Gill, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear in September 2010. This was not far from her home in County Durham. 

She was rescued by firefighters who spent an hour cutting her free from the wreckage and saved her life. 

While she was in the coma her family discussed turning off her life support at Newcastle General Hospital, but, at the last minute, she was able to move a finger, signalling for them to give her more time.

After she woke up Ms Emptage had difficulty adjusting to her memory loss.

The former model's family considered turning off her life support in hospital but she then started to move  

'Shock doesn't even come close to what I felt,' she said.

'They told me I had a daughter and I just stared at them and said, 'what?'' Eventually one image of Maddie, who was 14 at the time, came back to me, but she was a tiny little girl of about two.

'When she came to the hospital I had no idea who she was, I just couldn't believe I had a teenage daughter.

Memory loss after a head injury, such as that Ms Emptage suffered, is incredibly common and is always unique to the person. 

Luke Griggs, from brain injury charity Headway, said: 'Memory is not one 'thing' or one skill on its own. It is easily damaged by brain injury because there are several structures within the brain that are involved in processing information, storing it and retrieving it.' 

Mr Griggs said memory loss often occurs after a brain injury. When people forget information forgotten before the injury this is known as retrograde amnesia. Memory loss usually ranges from a few minutes to a few months.

'However, memory loss after brain injury can be unpredictable and some people may experience more extreme symptoms, particularly with more severe injuries,' he added.

'Every brain injury is unique and there's no 'one size fits all' approach to rehabilitation.' 

'I still have no memories of her before the crash, and it has been hard.' 

Ms Emptage, of Burnopfield, County Durham had also completely forgotten she had a boyfriend of six years who had come to see her every day while she'd been in hospital. The pair split up shortly after the accident.

She added 'I thought I was about 22, I still cannot remember my childhood, going to school or my oldest friends.'

Ms Emptage has now met the firefighters at Swalwell Community Fire Station, Gateshead. 

The crew spent over an hour cutting her free from the wreckage of her car, and saving her life four years ago.

When she walked into the station she recognised three members of the crew, only to be told that they were the people who rescued her.

She said: 'This whole time I believed I had been alone that night without any real human contact but it all came flooding back to me when I saw their faces.'

Ms Emptage said it had been a huge comfort to learn she had not been alone after the crash. 

She said: 'I wanted to meet the firefighters who came to my rescue that night. I wanted to say a huge thank you, I owe them my life.' 

Watch manager Mark Westgarth, the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service officer in charge at the incident, said: 'We vividly remember this crash.

It took firefighters more than an hour to cut the former model free from the wreckage of her car after the crash

Ms Emptage has made a full physical recovery and is driving again, but can only remember life at 22 

'As we removed the roof of the car to gain access to Candace, crew members sat inside and talked to her throughout the rescue.

'She was losing a lot of blood and her lower leg was trapped by the buckled metal caused by the impact to the front end of the car.'

Ms Emptage has undergone months of intensive physiotherapy and speech therapy and still has no feeling down the right hand side of her body, but has now began driving again. She says she has a good relationship with her daughter, despite still being unable to remember her growing up. 

The 1990s was the decade that saw the Spice Girls explode into the charts, achieving their first number one with Wannabe in 1996 and coining the era of Girl Power. This was also the year that Prince Charles and Princess Diana got divorced, with Princess Diana losing the HRH title.

Music was a key part of the decade and saw the rise and fall of popular boy band Take That, charted by many teenagers' tears. Robbie Williams spectacularly left the band in 1995, causing bitter disappointment among young fans. A year later the band split up, causing further devastation, and a helpline had to be launched for dedicated Take That followers who were filmed in floods of tears after learning the news.

In the 1990s  mad cow disease became the latest health scare. The disease in cattle, known as BSE, had been around for decades but scientists made a link between this strain and a similar version of the disease in humans known as CJD. This led to the European Union banning exports of British beef. This ban would last 10 years. 

British football suffered a dismal blow during the 1990s. In Euro 1996 England lost to Germany in the semi-finals on penalties.

However it was also the time for advancement in technology. 

Most homes began to get the internet in 2009 and interest in space exploration grew with the launch of the Hubble Telescope, which is still orbiting the earth today.

In fashion the 90s were the era when wearing sportswear, whatever the occasion, became the desired look. Adidas trousers, Kappa jackets and Umbro trainers were high in the fashion stakes, along with caps and mood rings - designed to change colour to show if wearers were feeling a range of emotions from happy, stressed and jealous. And if you weren't wearing sportswear you were likely to be wearing denim, shorts, jackets, jeans - and on many occasions, all at the same time.

Friends, the American sitcom, was also key to the culture of teenagers growing up in the 90s. The show attracted a dedicated following and also saw the advent of 'the Rachel haircut', following Jennifer Aniston's popularity in the show.  

The Spice Girls were popular in the 90s, scoring their first number one with Wannabe and later, Too Much

Waking up to the world in 2010  

When Candace Emptage woke up in 2010 she would have noticed some drastic changes, as well as similarities in the music industry from the 1990s she remembered. Take That had reformed and in 2010 Robbie Williams decided to rejoin the band. However the industry were changing. The XFactor had been running for six years and was dominating the charts, with winner Matt Cardle at number one with Collide for three weeks. Justin Bieber had also risen to popularity, releasing his first album.

Swine flu, rather than mad cow disease, was the main health issue of the year, but cases had started to come to an end in 2010. England also saw a repeat performance of defeat on the football ground. The team again suffered were beaten by Germany, knocked out in the final 16 of the 2010 World Cup.
