The Qatar World Cup might not be until 2022, but one tiny inhabitant of the Arab state has already caught football fever.

These spectacular photos capture a bee as it balances a droplet - or ball - of water on its back, demonstrating incredible skills that rival those of celebrated Argentinian striker Lionel Messi.Â 

The talented bee is pictured balancing two droplets on his head, before it drops one in order to stay in control.

Doubling up: The daring bee shows off incredible skills as it balances two droplets on its back while perching on the end of a flower. The photos were taken after it was sprayed with water in a garden near Doha, Qatar

Fast footwork: Even after dropping one of its water droplets, the determined bee keeps its composure as it continues with its feat - stepping lightly across the petals of some delicate white flowers

Next step: The insect demonstrates its flawless technique and ambition as it moves from one flower to two. It manages to balance the water droplet on the back of its head as it takes a step between stems

Keeping the droplet positioned carefully on the back of its head, the insect then makes the daring move across a number of flowers.

Its incredible control over the ball is reminiscent of that shown by Messi on the pitch at this year's World Cup.

The striker will hope to lead his team through to the next round of the tournament when they take on Switzerland in Sao Paulo tonight.

The photos were taken by photographer Agus Sudarmanto, 50, who uses special macro photography techniques to capture the incredible close-up pictures.

Mr Sudarmanto, who lives near Doha, Qatar, said: 'There is no rain at all here so we have to pour and spray water periodically on flowers and small trees.

Final push: The bee crawls up a final flower with grace and balance reminiscent of legendary Argentinian striker Lionel Messi. This stunning set of images were captured by photographer Agus Sudarmanto

Final whistle: After reaching the top of the stem, the insect takes a breather. The photographer who took the image said it was the first time he had seen anything like this and that he did not want to miss the moment

'This is the reason there were drops on the bee but it was amazing how it was just delicately balanced on his back.

'I take a lot of macro photography in an old play area as there are a lot of insects in the bushes.

'But it was the first time I had seen something like this so I did not want this moment to be missed.'
