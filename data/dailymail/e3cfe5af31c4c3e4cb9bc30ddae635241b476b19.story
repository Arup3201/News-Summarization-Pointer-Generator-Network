Louis van Gaal's wife may have spent her birthday watching Manchester United, but she was treated to some belated celebrations on Monday afternoon.

The Dutch manager dedicated Sunday's 4-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers to his other half, Truus, claiming that three points at Old Trafford was the best present she could ask for.

But the 63-year-old ensured his partner had more to smile about than just footballing matters, by taking her for a long lunch at Piccolino restaurant in Hale, just outside Manchester.

The couple spent three hours with family members on the terrace of the Italian restaurant, where the quick lunch costs £15 for two courses.

Speaking after Sunday's win at Old Trafford, Van Gaal told the BBC: 'This is special because it is also the birthday of my wife.

'I have already given her a present but she said the biggest present shall be the victory. We give it to her.' 

But any hopes of a day without football for Mrs van Gaal were short lived, as she joined her husband at Old Trafford to watch Manchester United's Under 21s take on Sunderland Under 21s on Monday night.
