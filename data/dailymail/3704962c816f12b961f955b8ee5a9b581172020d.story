Pressure on Marks & Spencer boss Marc Bolland intensified today after the City punished the chain for a dismal performance in clothing this Christmas.

M&S shares were 4 per cent lower after last night's disclosure that like-for-like sales fell by 1.8 per cent in the UK in the 13 weeks to December 29, including a bigger-than-expected slump in general merchandise of 3.8 per cent.

Mr Bolland admitted that trading in non-food was not yet satisfactory but pointed out that the group had decided to protect margins by reducing the level of promotions and keeping more stock at full prices.

He also said a new management team, which includes ex-Jaeger boss Belinda Earl, needed more time to address the turnaround plan, with their first collection for the autumn-winter season not due in the shops until July.

However, City analysts said time was running out for Mr Bolland to show signs of trading improvement in clothing, particularly given the amount of money being spent on improving the company's stores.

Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said: 'It is clear that pressure is rising on the new management with respect to the nature and performance of forthcoming spring and summer clothing ranges at M&S in the UK, and an improvement in relative and absolute terms is necessary for shareholders' confidence to be bolstered.'

Seymour Pierce said it planned to cut £10million from its forecast for profits in the year to April to £645million, a figure which compares with the £1billion-plus achieved by the chain in the 2008 financial year.

The results come in contrast to other 
retail giants Next and John Lewis, which reported strong sales growth 
over the Christmas period.

Under-performing: M&S has reported a 1.8 per cent drop in UK like-for-like sales over the festive period, including a 3.8 per cent drop in general merchandise sales

Mr Bolland, who took over as chief executive in 2010, said it had been a 'challenging and highly promotional' general merchandise market

But the group produced a better-than-expected performance in its food business, where sales were up 0.3 per cent on a like-for-like basis

It said its free next day store 
collection initiative helped push online sales up 10.8 per cent in the 
period, with sales from mobile phones and tablet computers up 90 per 
cent.

M&S cashed in on the Kate effect in September, as they saw one pair of £19.50 Duchess of Cambridge-style nude courts fly off the shelves every two minutes. The style became one of M&S’s best-selling shoe ever.

Rosie 
Huntington-Whiteley's lingerie line, launched in October, proved a 
huge success, fast becoming the store's best-performing underwear range 
of all time. The company said the line 'surpassed all sales 
expectations'.

The company also landed a new appointment in Belinda Earl, former chief executive of Jaeger,
 Aquascutum and Debenhams, last year in a newly created part-time 
role. She is expected to be tasked with a radical overhaul of the 
clothing collections.

M&S went hi-tech, with free wi-fi in stores and iPads to help store assistants help shoppers find what they need. Futuristic beauty halls, complete with virtual makeovers, have also been a huge hit in stores and online.

Twiggy’s collections were a massive success – from a publicity point of view and as a device to win back the older shopper. Her £79 sequined jacket sold out in just two hours last April.

The group said the launch of more than 
700 new products helped it achieve record sales of almost £330million
 in the two key Christmas trading weeks.

The group said it was cautious about the year ahead and it expected to see continued pressure on consumers' disposable incomes.

Mr Bolland was forced to rush out the disappointing sales update late last night after details leaked out.

Finance chief Alan Stewart was also 
forced to defend his boss after he faced questions over whether his job 
was at risk, saying: ‘I don’t think you can expect Marc to answer that. 
He has the full support of the board and shareholders.’

The Dutchman defended his decision not to drop prices, saying: ‘We didn’t want to price promote ourselves this Christmas, but saw major retailers like Gap going into sale with up to 70 per cent off.’

He conceded: ‘Our clothing performance is not yet satisfactory, but we are confident that the steps being taken by the new management team will address this.’

Over Christmas the firm said party wear 
had sold strongly and lingerie sales rose 36 per cent. A range designed 
by model and actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley shifted more than 160,000
 pieces, while sales of accessories such as scarves were up 45 per cent.

The great blonde hope, Kate Bostock, who was hired as clothing chief in 2004 thanks to triumphs with George Davies and Next, left last year 'by mutual consent' after sales were down 6.8 per cent. She has since joined online retailer asos.com.

Carole Boyes-Weston, head of design for Per Una and Limited Collection womenswear brands, also left the company before Christmas after only five months in the job.

'Stock-buying blunders' and wet weather were blamed for a poor summer of clothing sales, while the February cold snap had shoppers looking for jumpers that were not there. M&S could have sold 300,00 items of knitwear, but it only had 100,000.

This was not the only buying error: It could have sold 17,000 of the sort of ballet pumps championed by the Middleton sisters, but it only had 10,000 in its shops. Failure to stock enough bestselling items represented £10 million in lost sales.

M&S ditched celebrity models, including Myleene Klass and Dannii Minogue, for the first time in 12 years after A-list advertising failed to convert to sufficient sales.

Big high street hitters, including Primark, Debenhams and Zara, were said to be grabbing M&S customers. Christodoulos Chaviaras at Barclays Capital said in November: 'In the last four years M&S only outperformed its peers in 2010. This underperformance will likely continue.'

And there was good news in the food 
division, with sales rising 0.3 per cent and record sales of nearly 
£330million over the two key Christmas trading weeks.

M&S
 shifted a record 1.5million fresh turkeys, up 4 per cent on last year, 
and sold 5 per cent more party food. Sales of chocolate boxes were up 8 
per cent.

Last year M&S suffered problems when
 stores ran out of stock of popular items and some shoppers complained 
that its fashion lines were dull and unappealing.

Slump: Clothing sales at Marks & Spencer fell over the vital period in the run-up to Christmas

Disappointing: The retailer blamed the fall in sales on others on the high street slashing their prices before Christmas

Bolland was born in Apeldoorn, Holland, and studied business administration and economics at Groningen University before joining Heineken as a graduate trainee. Over two decades he climbed the ranks to cemome chief operating officer and had a seat on the board of the brewer.

He joined Morrisons as chief executive in June 2006 and transformed the supermarket giant's fortunes over three years, before joining M&S in 2009.

M&S said its spring and summer ranges, which launched in stores this week, had been well received by the fashion press.

It added: 'In a challenging and highly promotional general merchandise market, we delivered fewer but more targeted promotions, with a focus on full price sales.

'As a result we offered customers great value at M&S quality, whilst protecting our gross margin.'
