The FIA has again questioned the financial 'failings' of Formula One following the downfall over the past week of Marussia and Caterham.

Earlier this season FIA president Jean Todt's plan to introduce a budget cap for 2015 was torpedoed by the major marques.

Despite an indication the teams were willing to finally accept a cost cap - after a 2009 proposal under former FIA president Max Mosley was also rejected - it was ultimately thrown out to Todt's fury.

Now, in the words of Mosley earlier this week 'the chickens have come to roost', with the financial unsustainability of running a Formula One team leading to Caterham and Marussia entering administration.

Offering a clear indication the situation has to change, the FIA has vowed to pursue a situation where the gap between the haves and have nots closes.

A statement from the FIA read: 'Looking beyond the end of the 2014 season, these failings again acutely raise the question of the economic balance of the FIA Formula One Championship and justify the position, expressed many times by the FIA, in favour of any initiative that will help reduce costs in order to ensure the survival of the existing grid or attract potential new entrants.

FIA president Jen Todt, speaking with F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, saw his calls for a budget cap rejected

'As such, the FIA, in close co-operation with FOM (Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One Management) and the different stakeholders in F1, will continue to work towards maintaining the attraction of the championship and the equitable participation of the teams in it in the years to come.'

Many will view the FIA's response as simply hot air as it has so far failed to turn meaningful actions in the past into reality.

For now, it would appear the FIA is to treat Marussia and Caterham with leniency in light of their circumstances.

The sport's regulations dictate a team that fails to fulfil its contractual obligations to the championship would face penalties.

For now, Ecclestone has given the two teams dispensation to miss this weekend's race in the United States and the next in Brazil just over a week away.

As for the season-ending grand prix in Abu Dhabi, that remains to be seen as administrators are currently trying to find buyers for both organisations.

The statement added: 'The FIA has been informed of the financial difficulties of the Caterham F1 and Marussia F1 Teams and of the considerable uncertainty surrounding their participation in the final races of the 2014 championship.

'It is the responsibility of the FIA stewards to determine whether or not a team has failed to fulfil its regulatory obligation to take part in all events on the calendar and to take whatever action they deem appropriate.

'However, we have every confidence the stewards are fully aware of the financial situation of the teams concerned and these matters are always assessed with extreme care and due regard for the circumstances involved.'
