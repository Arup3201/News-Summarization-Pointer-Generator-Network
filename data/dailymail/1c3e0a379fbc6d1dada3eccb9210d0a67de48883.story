Since the age of 11 Louise Lidington had dreamt of a marriage day with all the traditional vows.

But only hours before she was due to tie the knot, her hopes were shattered...when a registrar ruled the words ‘to have and to hold, in sickness and in health’ were too religious for their civil ceremony.

The 39-year-old and her new husband Gary, 43, had instead to say ‘hold and have’ and ‘in sickness and when we are well’.

Gary and Louise Lidington were told by the registrar that the wording of their wedding vows was too religious

They were told the traditional vows were too Christian because of their roots in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. Yet a minor tweak of the wording satisfied the officials.

Mrs Lidington found the process so ridiculous she burst into a fit of giggles during the ceremony at Wilton’s Music Hall, a historic Victorian theatre in the East End of London. Her husband, who is a barrister, stumbled over his new lines.

‘The vows are so important,’ said Mrs Lidington. ‘They have just stood the test of time, they sound like poetry, they flow beautifully and they are just the form of words that you expect at a wedding. Ever since I was 11 I just imagined that they would be the words I would use when I married my husband.

‘It just seems ridiculous that words which don’t mention religion could be so problematic.’

There is much confusion surrounding the law on civil weddings. The 1949 Marriage Act states that ‘no religious service shall be used at any marriage solemnised in the presence of a superintendent registrar’.

Eight years ago, however, the rules were relaxed to allow a limited amount of material that makes reference to religion – even the Robbie Williams song Angels.

Stunning venue: Mr and Mrs Lidington married at Wilton's Music Hall in London's East End on Saturday

It is now for register offices to interpret the law as they see fit.

The couple had spent months arranging their wedding and they believed they had agreed on the content of their vows at a meeting with Tower Hamlets registrars in February. On the afternoon before the ceremony, however, an official told Mrs Lidington she could not legally get married without a change of wording.

‘The registrar said she would not be able to marry us with these words and could I rewrite them over the phone,’ said the PR executive.

‘I just thought I can’t be rude, I can’t be offensive, because I have got to stand in front of her tomorrow and pledge my life to my husband.’

During his speech later on in the evening, Mr Lidington read out his original vows to his new wife.

‘Taking his lead, during my speech I said the words to him that we had originally chosen,’ Mrs Lidington said. ‘It was incredibly romantic and got a standing ovation from our guests.’

Tower Hamlets said its officials feared the original vows breached ‘the relevant legality process’.

A spokesman added: ‘We apologise for the short notice that Mr and Mrs Lidington received regarding changes to their chosen vows.

‘We worked closely with the couple to ensure the vows they exchanged on their special day were as close as possible to those initially chosen by them.’
