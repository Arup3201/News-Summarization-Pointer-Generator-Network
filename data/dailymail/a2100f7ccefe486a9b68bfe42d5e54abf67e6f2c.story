The State Department reviewed the graphic death scene of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in 'The Interview' and approved of it, according to newly-released hacked emails from Sony. 

The shocking report comes as five movie theater chains across the country pulled the film following threats from hackers to attack cinemas that air the film. The Landmark Sunshine Cinema canceled its New York premier of 'The Interviews' and also stepped up security over the threats.

The Daily Beast reports that emails from Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton reveal that two US government officials screened an early version of the film - including the controversial scene in which Kim Jong-un's head explodes in a fireball - and gave it their blessing.

Worldwide sensation: The brouhaha surrounding 'The Interview' comes down to one scene in which Kim Jong-un's head explodes in gruesome fashion 

Sony CEO Michael Lynton is the latest victim of the hacking attack, which is believed to come from 

Sony executives became concerned about 'The Interview,' a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, is June after North Korea called the film 'an act of war.' 

They hired an expert on North Korea from the Rand Corporation, who consulted with the State Departments special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, according to the Daily Beast. 

Ambassador Robert King, one of three top diplomats in charge of North Korean matters, concluded that the threats from the hermit nation were not terribly worrying, the Daily Beast reports. 

Additionally, the hacked emails reveal, Lynton spoke to a 'very senior' State Department official, who gave the green light to the controversial ending of the film, according to the news site. 

Sony has found itself at the center of an international incident over the film. North Korea hackers - or a group sympathetic to North Korea - are believed to be behind the cyber attack on Sony Pictures that has released millions of sensitive documents - including the emails of top executives.  

Lynton's emails were released online by the group on Tuesday.

Ambassador Robert King, special envoy for North Korea, reportedly weighed in on the film

Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, was hired by Sony to review the film and offer his expertise on how much it might inflame North Korean ire. 

He wrote in an email to Sony executives: 'I have been clear that the assassination of Kim Jong-Un is the most likely path to a collapse of the North Korean government. 

'Thus while toning down the ending may reduce the North Korean response, I believe that a story that talks about the removal of the Kim family regime and the creation of a new government by the North Korean people (well, at least the elites) will start some real thinking in South Korea and, I believe, in the North once the DVD leaks into the North (which it almost certainly will). So from a personal perspective, I would personally prefer to leave the ending alone.'

Lynton, according to the Daily Beast, replied: 'Spoke to someone very senior in State (confidentially). He agreed with everything you have been saying. Everything. I will fill you in when we speak.'

Mr Bennett added: Michael, I talked with Amb. King a few minutes ago. Their office has apparently decided that this is typical North Korean bullying, likely without follow-up, but you never know with North Korea. Thus, he did not appear worried and clearly wanted to leave any decisions up to Sony.'

Sony ended up pressuring Rogen, the director, producer and star of the film, to tone down the final death scene - removing some of the most gruesome details from the moment Kim Jong-un is killed. 

Additionally, an edited version of the scene will be shown in most foreign markets. The movie is not slated to open in Asia at all.
