Mitt Romney is still in the 'maybe' category for the 2016 presidential sweepstakes, judging from an interview published  Tuesday.

The former Massachusetts governor and 2012 also-ran said his thinking on a third try for the White House has boiled down to a line from the Jim Carrey movie 'Dumb and Dumber.'

In the movie, Carrey's goofy character Lloyd Christmas is spurned by a love interest who says there's a one-in-a-million chance she would be with him.

'So,' he replies hopefully: 'You're telling me there's a chance?'

Will he or won't he? Mitt Romney doesn't seem to know yet, and is playing the speculation game as well as he can

Romney trounces the Republcian field in early Iowa polling, but will he follow through?

Romney is playing along with the media's relentless will-he-or-won't-he curiosity – he told radio host Hugh Hewitt last month that he's not planning to run but 'circumstances can change' – but he's keeping his cards close to his vest.

Officially, he's not running. 

'I love the country enough to know that I'm not as good a candidate this time around as I think the other guys would be,' he told Hewitt.

'I want the country to win. I do not want to see Hillary Clinton as our next president.' 

But unofficially, he's staying in touch with his 2012 team of aides and consultants.

Asked if he identified personally with the Jim Carrey quote, Romney would only tell The New York Times, 'I have nothing to add to the story.'

But then came the latest non-denial-denial: 'We've got a lot of people looking at the race. We’ll see what happens.'

Jennifer Rubin

Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin assembled a list of 15 reasons why Mitt Romney should sit out 2016 and remain the GOP's elder statesman, including:

The long-time pol's wife Ann said during a Fox News Channel interview on Sept. 23 that 'Mitt and I are not making plans.'

But when host Neil Cavuto pointed out that Ronald Reagan only won the presidency after failing twice, she smiled.

'Well, we will see, won't we, Neil?' Mrs. Romney said.

If former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush were to throw his hat into the ring, she suggested, it might preclude a Mitt three-fer since the two men would compete for the same centrist, non-tea-party base.

But in a late August poll of likely Republican voters in Iowa, Bush came in a disappointing fifth place out of a field of 13 potential candidates, with barely 7 per cent support.

Placing ahead of him were Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, Rick Perry and 'undecided.'

When Romney's name was added as a 14th option in the poll, he crushed the competition with more than 35 per cent. Bush shrank to below a 5 per cent showing – 7th place.

As his poll numbers go up, Romney is attracting a dedicated cadre of true believers who are eager to capitalize on the buyer's remorse of disaffected Obama voters.

More than 120,000 of them have clicked the approval of a 'Draft Mitt' petition, but that support may be soft: The draft committee's Twitter account has just 173 followers.

And for every die-hard Mitt backer, there seems to be an equal and opposite detractor.

The naysayers tend to have the biggest megaphones.

Tanned, rested and ready: More than 120,000 Americans have signed an online petition encouraging the 2012 also-ran to take a third plunge into presidential politics

Jennifer Rubin, The left-leaning Washington Post's resident center-right columnist, opined Monday night that Romney should stay away from the 2016 race for the good of the Republican Party.

Romney 'was right about a host of issues, most especially on foreign policy,' she wrote. 'His obvious prowess as an executive is badly needed in the White House.'

'I find it nearly impossible to believe he wouldn’t have been a better choice for the country than President Obama has been. But he should not run for president a third time.'

What followed was a list of 15 reasons Romney should retire gracefully, or perhaps tee himself up as a potential Treasury Secretary appointee.

Chief among them: 'In promoting an anti-elitism message, the GOP has the upper hand against Hillary – unless Romney runs.'
