The maker of hipster-favorite PBR beer is being sold to a Russian beverage company.

Pabst Blue Ribbon — famous for its blue-collar appeal and cheap price — will soon be owned Oasis Beverages, a beer and soda company based in Moscow and operating in Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Ukraine.

The company also brews Colt 45, Old Milwaukee and Schlitz.

'Pabst Blue Ribbon is the quintessential American brand — it represents individualism, egalitarianism, and freedom of expression — all the things that make this country great,' said Eugene Kashper, of Oasis Beverages, who will serve as the new CEO of Pabst.

'We intend to invest meaningfully in the organization, to continue strong marketing support for PBC's unique brands, and to drive new product innovations and renovations, such as the recent launch of Ballantine IPA.'

Pabst sold a whopping 90 millions gallons of PBR in 2013, nearly 200 percent more than just 10 years earlier, the Huffington Post reported.

Ex-Pabst owner C. Dean Metropoulous had been seeking a new owner for his iconic brand since March, when it was rumored that he was considering taking the company public.

Back then, the brewery was expected to raise between $500 million and $1 billion, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Although a final price tag was not disclosed, insiders say the sale values Pabst between  $700 million and $750 million, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Pabst Brewing, now based in Los Angeles, traces its roots back to 1844 in Milwaukee.

Since purchasing it in 2010, Metropoulos has enlisted comedian Will Ferrell to market the company's beers.

Oasis is buying Pabst with TSG, an investment firm known for its work with consumer products companies. TSG Consumer Partners will take a minority stake in Pabst.
