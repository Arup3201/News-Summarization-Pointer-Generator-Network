Patrick Campbell, 33, was arrested on Wednesday at JFK Airport in New York after traveling to the U.S. via Paris from Sierra Leone with a sample of uranium hidden in the soles of his shoes and in his luggage.

When it is processed, yellowcake uranium can be used in nuclear weapons. The U.S. bans the supply of such material to country's such as Iran which are outspoken about their nuclear ambitions.Â 

According to the Smoking Gun, Campbell told an undercover agent that he had connections to a Sierra Leone firm that deals in uranium and precious minerals.

When he was arrested, Campbell had an onward ticket for Miami.

The 33-year-old made his initial court appearance on Thursday at U.S. District Court in Brooklyn.

According to the criminal complaint filed
 in the Southern District of Florida, Campbell brokered the supply of 
goods he knew were destined for supply to Iran.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations office conducted the investigation over 15 months.

It's not known if he has an attorney. If convicted, Campbell faces up to 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
