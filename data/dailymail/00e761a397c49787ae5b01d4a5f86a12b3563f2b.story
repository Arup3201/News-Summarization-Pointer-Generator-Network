There has been a lot of woeful decisions in the Premier League in recent weeks.

But the decision to rule out Jan Vertonghen’s second goal at White Hart Lane surely tops the lot when it comes to embarrassing the art of officiating.

The Belgian thought he had grabbed a brace when he reeled away in celebration at White Hart Lane to add sparkle to Tottenham’s win against Sunderland.

However, the linesman in north London had different ideas as he held his flag out for offside, despite the fact the defender picked the ball up inside his OWN half.

Sunderland were on the attack with goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon nowhere to be seen when the ball broke to the defender who galloped clear from his own half before coolly slotting home.

Video highlights later showed the linesman telling the referee in his ear piece that there was only one player covering, therefore the player was offside.

But that ruling would only come into play if the defender was in the oppositions half when he was played the ball, with replays showing he was five-yards or so in his own half. 

It was clearly one of the worst decisions ever seen in the Premier League, but luckily for the officials Tottenham still secured all three points with a 2-1 win to keep their top four dreams alive.
