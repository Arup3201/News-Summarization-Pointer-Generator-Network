The Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald speaks to reporters at his hotel in Hong Kong - the journalist has claimed that Edward Snowden has handed out thousands of secure documents stolen from the NSA that will be unleashed should anything happen to him

Edward Snowden, the United States' most notorious and wanted leaker of national security secrets has given encoded files containing whole swathes of undisclosed information to several people should something happen to him.

Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who was contacted by the former NSA systems administrator in February said that the paranoid Snowden 'has taken extreme precautions to make sure many different people around the world have these archives to insure the stories will inevitably be published.'

The individuals entrusted with the files cannot currently access the data without passwords, but 'if anything happens at all to Edward Snowden, he told me he has arranged for them to get access to the full archives.'

Worryingly for U.S. intelligence officials and the Obama administration it is unclear what else Snowden has taken while he was able to access secure files from the National Security Agency.

The Guardian and The Washington Post have already published slides from the program called Prism which allows the NSA access to data on non-U.S. citizens from Internet companies such as Facebook and Google.

According to NSA Director Keith Alexander, Snowden was able to access these files by creating digital keys that gave him access to secure areas despite him being only a contractor and systems administrator.

Greenwald has said that he has been sent thousands of other documents by Snowden that he is pouring over right - directly contradicting Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee who said that Snowden only possessed 200 files.

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, allegedly has thousands of secret NSA documents that he will reveal to the public in the event of his disappearance or death as a passenger takes a picture of the sun rising at the Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where he is currently holed up

'I don’t know for sure whether Snowden has more documents than the ones he has given me,' Greenwald said to The Daily Beast. 'I believe he does. He was clear he did not want to give to journalists things he did not think should be published.'

And in addition to the documents that have been printed in The Guardian and The Washington Post, Snowden has given interviews to the South China Morning Post - an English language paper in Hong Kong.

Snowden has apparently disclosed Internet Protocol addresses for computers in China and Hong Kong that the NSA monitored. The paper also reported a claim from Snowden that the NSA scooped up text-message data from Hong Kong residents.

However, Greenwald said that he was unsure of the wisdom of Snowden's revelations to the South China Morning Post.

'Whether I would have disclosed the specific IP addresses in China and Hong Kong the NSA is hacking, I don’t think I would have,' Greenwald said to The Daily Beast.

'What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.'

U.S. whistle-blower Edward Snowden is displayed on a giant screen in Hong Kong, China - it is believed he sent secret files to a number of individuals from the state before revelations were made public in The Guardian newspaper earlier in June

However, Greenwald made the point that Snowden, 30, only wanted to publications to print what was in the public's interest - unlike Wikileaks which published the names of serving intelligence operatives still in the field.

'Snowden himself was vehement from the start that we do engage in that journalistic process and we not gratuitously publish things,' Greenwald said.

'I do know he was vehement about that. He was not trying to harm the U.S. government; he was trying to shine light on it.'

'He was very insistent he does not want to publish documents to harm individuals or blow anyone’s undercover status,' Greenwald added.

'Leaking CIA documents can actually harm people, whereas leaking NSA documents can harm systems.'

Departed: Snowden was believed to be booked on Flight CU 6150 from Moscow to Cuba on Monday

Where is he? Passengers queue on Monday to board a plane to Cuba at a terminal of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. But Edward Snowden was nowhere to be seen despite being booked on the flight

Indeed, Greenwald specifically mentioned Wikileaks policy of publishing hundreds of thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables and intelligence reports from Afghanistan and Iraq - without redacting names.

'I am supportive of WikiLeaks, but I am doing something different,' Greenwald said.

While the reporting of Snowden's data so fat has only disclosed wholesale telephone data, not those of specific individuals, Greenwald declined to say whether he possessed evidence of this occurring.

When asked if Greenwald thought his computer was being monitored by the U.S. government he said

'I would be shocked if the U.S. government were not trying to access the information on my computer.

'I carry my computers and data with me everywhere I go.'

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and his team chose to initially publish hundreds of thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables and intelligence reports from Afghanistan and Iraq¿initially without removing the names of individuals
