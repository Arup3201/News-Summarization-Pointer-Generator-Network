Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool - Click here to read Martin Samuel's match report from the Bernabeu 

A glance at the tweets, forum postings and comments coming out of Merseyside would suggest that Brendan Rodgers still has more Liverpool fans for him than against.

So the jury is split. To those who say Rodgers ran up the white flag in Madrid, the case for the defence would point to the result. A 1-0 defeat, against Real, Ronaldo and all. Pats on the back all round.

Whichever way you look at it, Rodgers’s decision to ‘rest’ his best players for a Champions League tie of huge importance was a brave one.

Brendan Rodgers decided to makes seven changes for Tuesday night's clash against Real Madrid. 

Only Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel, Alberto Moreno and Joe Allen survived from the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle at the weekend.

Somehow Liverpool avoided a tonking, which justified the bizarre sight of Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Mario Balotelli, Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson sitting on the bench at kick-off.

After all there is still a trip to Ludogorets to go and that is a banker win, surely?

Now for the aftermath. Hear that? It is the cranking up of pressure on a manager who has publicly demonstrated that Europe is not his holy grail despite spending all of last season aiming for it.

A glance ahead at the fixture list gives away Rodgers’s thought processes, which centre round Chelsea and the weekend date at Anfield.

There is a 12-point gap between the Premier League leaders and Liverpool in seventh place and Rodgers clearly wants to avoid it widening even further. Yet by turning his attention to domestic matters, he threatens to undermine all that went on last season.

Think back to a campaign in which Liverpool went on a 16-match unbeaten run, carried on a tide of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge goals and with the title a realistic objective.

When the pressure got to the team and results went against them, the refrain from the Kop was ‘get us back into the Champions League’.

To the neutral, Liverpool is unique with its pre-match unfurling of flags and stage-managed by emotional rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone. That atmosphere was shaped in Europe, back in the day when the Champions League was just for champions.

The hashtag #YNWA is synonymous with the club, which is why Rodgers will not be publicly condemned by the Anfield faithful although there may be mutterings in private.

If last season was the launch pad to the ‘project’, then this campaign was supposed to be about Gerrard strutting his stuff on the European stage while Liverpool stayed in contention for domestic honours too.

Flawed genius Luis Suarez has gone, Sturridge is injury-prone and Mario Balotelli is, well, Mario Balotelli, so it does not take a genius to work out that Liverpool are not as good as they were last season.

But if they want to continue to be recognised as a big club, rather than a club with a big history, then a giant step forward must be taken.

What happens if Rodgers’s rested players return only to lose to Chelsea? What happens if Ludogorets goes terribly wrong?

Supporters will flip that question. Beating Jose Mourinho, reaching the knock-out stages of the Champions League and Rodgers will look like a genius.

He reacted petulantly to Gary Lineker’s criticism on Tuesday night by questioning the BBC pundit’s managerial cv. At the same time, Rodgers cleverly plants a siege mentality into the minds of players and fans.

Only time will tell, who is right.
