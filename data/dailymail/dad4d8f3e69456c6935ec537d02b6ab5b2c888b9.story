Actor Larry Lamb claims the GOPO supplement has banished the surging pain he felt in his knees and hips when running

Determined to stay fit and healthy, actor Larry Lamb turned to running.

Entering his sixth decade, the star of EastEnders and Gavin and Stacey fame, laced up his trainers once more.

Having suffered painful back ache in his younger years, the now 67-year-old has for the last decade religiously performed half-an-hour of stomach crunches every day to ensure his core was taught to relieve any strain on his back.

But at the age of 60, with his back pain 'well and truly under control', he began to suffer twinges and burning sensations surging through his knees and hips.

Refusing to give in to the pain. he experimented to try and ease his discomfort.

Despite shelling out for proper running shoes and enduring daily doses of raw cod liver oil, the pain persisted.

It wasn't until Larry happened upon an article outlining a new drug-free supplement, that he found his answer.

GOPO is a supplement, containing a unique part of a rose hip, which helps tackle joint pain.

It claims to be the only product of its kind to contain a high level of GOPO - a key component of the rose hip, which is thought to play a valuable role in the care of joints and joint tissues.

And the supplement contains high levels of vitamin C, which is thought to boost the immune system and help the body form collagen, which aids joints. 

Larry told MailOnline: 'It has changed my life. I have to say, it's just incredible.'

Around 26 million people across the UK suffer back pain, with many more afflicted by joint inflammation and damage.

A recent survey found 90 per cent of people suffering back pain rely on paracetamol to ease their agony.

It comes as another piece of research, published in The Lancet, concluded the painkiller is no better than a placebo at speeding recovery.

It has prompted experts to call for a change in the advice given, to consider whether it is appropriate to recommend paracetamol as a treatment for back pain.

Having been active throughout his life to combat back pain, when he took up running again in his early 60s, Larry started to suffer sharp pain in his knees and hips.

'In my early 60s I started to notice problems with my hips – just the occasional twinge here and there – and like most, I ignored the pains and got on with it,' he said.

'However, my left foot, back and knees also started to give me gyp - especially my back, which was becoming increasingly painful and stiff. 

I've always lived a very active life and I put my aches and pains down to my age and the travelling I do for work.'

Larry recently toured around Europe and Tunisia for a Channel 5 programme exploring and telling the story of the birth of the Roman Republic. 

The 67-year-old star of Gavin and Stacey took up running again in his early 60s determined to stay fit and healthy. But for the first time in his life he was struck by niggling joint ache

Larry, who played Archie Mitchell in Eastenders, told MailOnline that after trying proper running shoes and various supplements, including daily doses of raw cod liver oil,  he discovered GOPO, made from rosehip

Determined not to slow down, the father-of-four, who revealed he does stomach crunches for an half-an-hour every day to keep his abs in shape, said he realised he needed to invest more time and care looking after himself.

After buying hi-tech running shoes, but still suffering the pain, he turned to various supplements.

He said: 'I'm conscientious about my health, as an older father (his youngest daughters are 11 and 15) it is your job to run around after your children even if your body is telling you otherwise.

'I've never been one for extreme sports, but I did start running six years ago in a bid to look after myself a bit better.

'However, I had to put it to one side as my knees worsened and the pain became unbearable.It was a pain I have never felt before.

Larry said the rose hip supplement has 'changed my life' and since taking it he has suffered no pain at all

'It dawned on me that a hip or joint replacement at my age was a possibility, but it was something I desperately wanted to avoid.'  

The 67-year-old first tried cod liver oil, taking it in its raw form, but admitted: 'there's no charm in cod liver oil'.

But after reading an article by Arlene Phillips, a past judge on Strictly Come Dancing, Larry said he learned of the supplement GOPO.

The clinically-proven supplement is specially cultivated from natural rose hip.

It also claims to be the only product of its kind to contain high levels of GOPO - the key rose hip component which is thought to play a valuable role in the care of joints and joint tissues.

Larry said: 'It has changed my life. I have to say, it's just incredible.'

Since starting the supplement three months ago, he said he has not felt one twinge or shooting pain, 'not even one', he added.

'I started taking GOPO after hearing that rose hip works wonders for joint pain – and I can honestly say I have never felt better. 

'Within six weeks I noticed a difference, and it definitely helped me scramble across the Roman Ruins.

'Not only has GOPO eradicated the pain I had in my hips and knees, it has also improved my overall wellbeing; I now feel ready to take on my next physical challenge. 

'Now my joints are so supple, if I didn't have two left feet, I'd put my name down for Strictly Come Dancing!'  

And his are sentiments backed up by the professionals.

Dr Rod Hughes, consultant rheumatologist at St Peter's Hospital in Surrey, said drug-free alternatives to painkillers are effective in treating back pain. 

He told MailOnline: 'There is a large body of evidence supporting the use of GOPO - a compound derived from rose hip - in musculoskeletal conditions, with research indicating that it can effectively relieve acute exacerbations of chronic back pain.

'The natural anti-inflammatory properties of GOPO make it a viable replacement to paracetamol in cases of non-specific lower back pain, without the risk of harmful side effects.' 

GOPO Joint Health is the only product of its kind to contain GOPO - a key component of the rose hip, which is thought to ease joint pain

GOPO is made from 100 per cent specially cultivated natural rose hip.

It is the only product of its kind to contain a high level of GOPO - a key component of the rose hip, which is thought to play a valuable role in the care of joints and joint tissues.

Rosehip contains a high concentration of Vitamin C - 50 per cent more than oranges. 

It makes rose hip very effective at boosting the immune system, is commonly used to help treat colds.

Vitamin C is also essential for the normal collagen formation, needed to promote health bones and cartilage.

It contains powerful antioxidants which act to combat free radicals in the body, which trigger damage to the hips, joints and other areas of the body.

The herbal medication is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties.

It contains polyphenols and anthocyanins, which are thought to ease joint inflammation and prevent joint damage.

GOPO was discovered more than 20 years ago in Denmark, and significant levels can only be gathered if the rose hips are dried using a special patented process.

It has been available in Denmark for 10 years, and this year was launched in the UK.

A pack of 120 5g tablets costs £17.99. Patients take four a day.

And Professor Andrew Moore, a leading researcher in pain at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, added: 'Paracetamol is far from an innocuous drug.

'There may be some patients who will benefit from its use, but they will be very few in number.

'Risk of harm will outweigh the benefit for those patients who are not getting pain relief.'  

Osteopath at Physical Balance Hampshire, Ian Harrison, added that GOPO helps reduce swelling, which causes joint pain.

He said: 'While there are all sorts of back problems, pain is always the common denominator - if people can manage their pain, it will help them keep moving and that is key to breaking the back pain cycle.

'GOPO works to reduce swelling and the pain associated with it.

'We see a lot of patients with back pain but in many instances it may only be mild pain or it could be a reoccurring problem that could be self-managed.

'People should always check serious problems with a healthcare professional, but there are steps they can take on their own to avoid falling into the back pain trap.'   

A study published in The Lancet found paracetamol is no better than placebo in the treatment of low-back pain

A recent study published in The Lancet concluded that paracetamol is no better than a placebo at speeding recovery.

The research questioned the universal endorsement of paracetamol as the first choice painkiller for low-back pain.

Low-back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide.

National clinical guidelines universally recommend the painkiller as the first choice analgesic. 

The Paracetamol for Low-Back Pain study (PACE) randomly assigned 1,652 people, with an average age of 45 and suffering acute low-back pain, to receive four weeks of paracetamol.

One group was assigned a regular dose, three times a day, another took the drug as needed, while a third group received a placebo.

All participants were followed up after three months.

No difference in the length of time it took participants to recover was found between the three groups.

The study authors, said: 'Paracetamol also had no effect on short-term pain levels, disability, function, sleep quality, or quality of life.' 

Dr Christopher Williams, from the George Institute for Global Health at the University of Sydney, in Australia, said: 'Simple analgesics such as paracetamol might not be of primary importance in the management of acute lower back pain. 

'The results suggest we need to reconsider the universal recommendation to provide paracetamol as a first-line treatment for low-back pain, although understanding why paracetamol works for other pain states but not low-back pain would help direct future treatments.'
