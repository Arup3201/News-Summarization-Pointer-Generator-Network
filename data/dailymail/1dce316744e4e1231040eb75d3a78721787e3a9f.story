In the 82nd minute, a large, white paper aeroplane floated down the considerable distance from Wembley’s third tier and struck Hansell Riojas, a Peru substitute playing at full-back, on his right shoulder. It drew the most heartfelt cheer of the night.

Quite right, too. Skill like that you don’t see every day. The rest of it, we’ve sort of seen before.   

The most famous Peruvian visitor to these shores took to hanging about antiques shops in Portobello Road and kept marmalade sandwiches under his hat, so it is fair to say not a huge amount was expected of England's opponents and they did not disappoint.

Peru turned in enough skilful, enterprising play on the counter early on to pose a gentle threat, followed by some woeful defending of set-pieces that afforded England two second-half goals from corners, and a scoreline with emphasis.

It
 will not be this easy in Brazil. The Italian back four have seen the 
odd inswinging corner and, first of all, you have to get up their end of
 the field to win it. On this evidence, what progress  England do make 
in that direction will be painstaking, to say the least.

The energy levels grew as more players with a point to prove — 
those not in the starting line-up — were introduced, but if this was a 
dry-run for England’s tempo in the heat of Manaus, ‘slow and steady wins
 the race’ seems to be the motto. England’s first group game with Italy 
is the shortest price for a 0-0 draw of any fixture in the tournament, 
and with good reason.

Still,
 a party with a happy atmosphere was the demand and England will depart 
for Brazil via Miami this weekend, smiling. There was music, a bit of 
Mexican wave-style dancing and some games with planes kept the guests 
amused when the sporting fare failed to satisfy.

Whether this England team will fly quite as gracefully once the serious stuff begins is another matter entirely.

Still,
 a win is a win, and there is nothing wrong with Leighton Baines showing
 his worth from corners as he did on two  occasions once captain Steven Gerrard had surrendered his duties on leaving the field — or Daniel 
Sturridge finding his range from outside the area, as he did in the 
first half. Sturridge’s goal, coming after 32 minutes and much needed 
after a turgid opening, was the true highlight of the night.

The chance of finding a back four in Brazil quite as prone to bouts of narcolepsy, however, is unlikely.

Glen
 Johnson took a quick throw-in on the right, and would have been 
delighted to find the two nearest defenders in repose and in no position
 to stop Sturridge receiving the ball and turning towards goal. He was 
forced out to just beyond the penalty area by the one Peruvian paying 
attention but it was not diversion enough. Sturridge sighted the target 
and hit a lovely left-foot shot that curled away from goalkeeper Raul 
Fernandez, who is not the most imposing presence, it must be said.

A big hand: Joe Hart was called into action several times but kept Peru at bay

The
 goal gave England the breathing space required and Peru’s defence did 
the rest. It might have been different if a 35-yard shot from Jean Deza,
 who has spent the past year on loan at Montpellier, had dipped an extra
 six inches nine minutes into the second half but it didn’t and Peru’s 
threat then passed.

Their 
best spell had come in the first half when Joe Hart saved another 
deflected shot from Deza and then kept out Luis Ramirez with his feet, 
but Peru were nifty without being greatly intimidating. They were chosen
 for this purpose, one supposes, and served it well.

It
 may be that manager Roy Hodgson instructed his squad to imagine this 
was a stifling night in tropical Manaus and to play at a tempo conducive
 to saving energy in heat and humidity. We can only hope so.

If
 not, England need to find  several gears if they are to make any 
impression on the group in Brazil, let alone the tournament. No matter 
the conditions, a certain rhythmic level is required and  England lacked
 it for long periods.

It is 
not a good sign when the biggest cheer is provoked by paper missiles, 
or when the first successful throw on to the playing area instantly 
inspires hundreds of distracted imitators.

Sadly,
 all that was proven for much of the night is that England’s flyers are 
as inconsistent as their footballers: the very occasional score 
enlivening a rather ordinary succession of failures.

Having
 said this, a good set-piece will always win matches, even in the most 
rarefied atmosphere, and England are taking a weapon of sorts to South 
America in the shape of Baines.

It
 was the Everton man who picked out Gary Cahill in the 65th minute for a
 thumping header that gave England a two-goal cushion and dispelled any 
hope of a Peruvian revival. The marking was ordinary and it always helps
 when the man guarding the far post would need a pogo stick to reach any
 header steered towards the top corner, but Peru’s shortcomings are not 
England’s responsibility.

There
 was a degree of fortune with the third, however, the entirely 
unconvincing Fernandez dropping what should have been a simple gather, 
the ball clipping Cahill’s head on the way down and falling to Phil 
Jagielka who prodded it smartly through the hapless goalkeeper’s 
legs.

Fernandez then 
collapsed to the floor as if injured — his pride more than his body, one
 suspects. The usual regiment of substitutes invaded towards the end, 
but we are well and truly in phoney war territory now.

Hodgson
 says that he has not made his mind up on the team, but performances in 
training are as likely to influence a final decision as any match — 
unless a player turns in a performance of extremes, either positive or 
negative.

There was nothing at either end here. England did what was expected, but need to step it up this summer.

They
 walked from the field accompanied by a blast of Papa Loves Mambo, no 
doubt intended to make those gathered think optimistically of summer in 
Rio de Janeiro. Mambo is Cuban music. Let’s hope the team are better 
prepared than the fellow in charge of the soundtrack.
