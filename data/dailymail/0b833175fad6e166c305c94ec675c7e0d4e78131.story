A woman dubbed 'Britain's biggest patriot' has dressed up to celebrate every single national holiday for the last 40 years.

Pam Radford, 68, from Merstham, Surrey, has commemorated every St Patrick's Day, St George's Day, St Andrew's Day and St David's Day since 1972.

She dresses top to toe in the appropriate costume and goes to her local pub to spread patriotic cheer.

Dedicated Pam also dons military dress six times every year, to mark Victory in Europe Day, Victory over Japan Day, D-Day, Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday - as well as the newly marked Armed Forces Day.

Pam, a retired secretary, also puts on fancy dress every time there is a Comic Relief or Children in Need appeal.

She said: 'Some people think I'm a bit mad, but I love it. I do get positive reactions from people. Sadly, these days we only ever seem to celebrate St Patrick's Day.

'I want to make sure people don't forget the other special occasions on our calendar.'

While Pam sometimes travels further away from home to spread her patriotic cheer, she prefers doing the same regular walk around her home town.

Pam said: 'It all started way back in the early 70's. I had loads of Irish friends at the time, and as the years went by I was wearing more and more green on St Patrick's Day.

'In 1972, when I was head-to-toe in green, I decided that I loved dressing up so much I would celebrate every day I could.'

Pam celebrates Valentine's Day, Mothering Sunday, Easter and Halloween with fancy dress - but shuns April Fools' Day.

She said: 'I don't do April Fools' Day, because I'm dressed as a fool most of the time already.'

Pam's fancy dress has a serious side as she uses it as a means to raise money for charity.

She said: 'Charity is my life. If I can do anything to help others, I will.

'I'm still a member of the Royal British Legion - every year I'm out there collecting money for the Poppy Appeal, and if there is ever an opportunity for me to go out and raise money for a worthy cause, I will.

'I never married. I never found time for it, really. I just spend every spare moment I have enjoying myself, and trying to help others.'

On military occasions, Pam can dig out camouflage, period war uniforms and her Royal British Legion outfit from her massive fancy dress box. She even tailors what she drinks for each occasion.

She said: 'For St Patrick's, it's obviously Guinness, and for St George's I go for bitter.

'On St Andrew's Day I drink whisky, which I don't particularly like the taste of, but it's got to be done.

'None of my Welsh friends can tell me what their national drink is, so on St David's Day, I just drink whatever I want.

'I've started drinking more halves now than pints, as I'm getting on a bit.

'But I stand up for as long as possible when I'm drinking, because my old dad always used to say "if you can stand, you're not in trouble".'

But despite celebrating 15 different occasions every year, Pam is hoping to add one more to her list and buy a kilt in time for Burns Night next January.

14 February - Valentine's Day - An outfit to go dancing in.

1 March - St David's Day - Anything red, white and green, and a daffodil.

March - Comic Relief - Anything silly.

17 March - St Patrick's Day - Everything green.
