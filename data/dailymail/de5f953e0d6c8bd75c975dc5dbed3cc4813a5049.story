Several taxis carrying passengers have been attacked by angry mobs in France, as a dispute over minicab regulations in the country turns physical.

There were reports of attacks in both Paris and Lyon, as groups of up to 20 men set upon taxis run by the company Uber, smashing their windows and letting down tires.

The violence comes after thousands of taxi drivers staged furious protests across France yesterday, objecting to the emergence of pre-book services that they worry will impact on the hail-and-ride culture they rely on.

Under attack: Kat Borlongan, co-founder of consulting firm Five by Five, tweeted that she was travelling from Charles de Gaulle airport in one of the Uber taxis that was set upon by the angry mob

Lucky escape: Ms Borlongan said the protesters threw paint and rocks at the vehicle before attempting to break in. The passengers were left with cuts to their hands from the shattered glass

Kat Borlongan, co-founder of consulting firm Five by Five, says she was travelling from Charles de Gaulle airport in one of the Uber taxis that came under attack.

An image she shared on Twitter shows a smashed passenger window and a flat tire that appears to have been slashed with a knife.

Ms Borlongan says the angry mob threw paint and rocks at the vehicle before attempting to break in.

The passengers were left with cuts to their hands from the shattered glass.

In a post on Twitter Ms Borlongan added: ‘Attackers tried to get in the car but our brave @uber driver maneuvered us to safety, changed the tire on the freeway and got us home.’

Renaud Visage, photographer and CTO of Eventbrite, was traveling in the car with Ms Borlongan, and confirmed the attack in an interview with theVerge.com.

Renaud Visage said police were standing close by and watched the attack on his vehicle take place but added 'they were just watching... they were not actively doing anything'

Mr Visage said a blockade on the motorway forced cars to drive on a single lane and when the Uber taxi was spotted it was attacked by ‘three or four men’.

He added that another group set on the car at a second blockade further down the road, slashing the tire and forcing them to make a dramatic getaway before pulling over and making the emergency repairs.

Most worryingly, Mr Visage said police were standing close by and watched the whole incident take place ‘but they were just watching… they were not actively doing anything’.

Uber confirmed the incident in a statement on its website. 'That taxis chose to use violence today is unacceptable, that they chose to strike is their business,' the company said.

'However, Parisians also have a choice when it comes to moving around in their city, and today's incident certainly discourages Parisians from choosing a taxi for their next ride.'

Protest: Empty taxis blocked ranks at airports and stations across France, and up to a thousand drivers attended a demonstration in central Paris

The attacks took place amid a national protest expressing anger over ‘unfair competition’.

Empty taxis blocked ranks at airports and stations across the country, and up to a thousand drivers attended a demonstration in central Paris last night.

Similar rallies were held in Marseille, Bordeaux, Montpellier and Lyon.

The anger comes as a result of concerns that regulations on pre-booking services such as Uber, Snapcar and Allocab are not tight enough and risk damaging the business of traditional hail-and-ride drivers who pay a heavy fee to attain a licence to carry passengers.

The French government has already come out on the side of traditional taxi drivers, imposing a minimum 15-minute wait between booking and pick-up on all pre-book services since the beginning of the year.

However hail-and-ride drivers are demanding a waiting time of 30 minutes is imposed, along with a minimum €60 fare and tougher licence regulations.
