Roy Hodgson praised the second-half impact of Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere following England’s goalless draw with Honduras – but he bemoaned the absence of Raheem Sterling.

The Three Lions signed off from their World Cup preparations with a frustrating stalemate against the Central Americans in Miami, a match which was delayed for 30 minutes during the first half because of an electrical storm.

England did press for an opener following the half-time introduction of midfield duo Barkley and Wilshere and they were arguably the two biggest positives to emerge from the game.

And while Hodgson was cheered by their contribution, he conceded that not being able to call upon the suspended Sterling was a frustration.

‘I’m disappointed Raheem Sterling couldn’t play because in games like this, where you have the ball in and around the penalty area, players like him with that incredible dribbling skill can make the difference,’ he told ITV.

‘I thought that Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere added a great injection of attacking flair to our game.

‘We really did take the game to them in the second half in particular.

‘We pushed them back but unfortunately it was that last pass or last shot which didn’t go our way.

‘I will take the draw and that we got away without injuries and that we have experience against Central American opposition.’

He added: ‘It’s time for the real thing now. We’ve had these three weeks and it could not have gone much better.’
