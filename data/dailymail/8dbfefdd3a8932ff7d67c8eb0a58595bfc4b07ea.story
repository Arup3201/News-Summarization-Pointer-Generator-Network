A father who worked as a teacher and volunteered with orphans has been killed in a tragic motorbike accident after he collided with a lorry.

Christopher Hart, 44, a keen coach for various sporting teams, was on his way home from cricket practice in the resort of Phuket when he collided with the truck last night.

Mr Hart moved to Thailand six years ago, where he met his wife, Bangon and they have a three year old son together called Oliver.

Away from the classroom Mr Hart was also a website designer for a languages company and volunteered with local orphans.

Mr Hart, a Manchester City fan from Rochdale, planned to move back to Britain next year having lived in various other countries including Australia, Mexico, Spain and the Netherlands.

His mother, Josie, from Littleborough, Greater Manchester, paid tribute to him, saying: 'Chris was an incredible person.

'He loved his family and friends, loved sport, loved Littleborough and loved life.

Thailand is one of the most dangerous places in the world to drive if you are a tourist.

A study found only roads in Honduras claimed more foreign lives.

More than 11,000 people die in the country every year riding motorbikes, according to Thai Government statistics.

'He will be missed by so many people whose lives he touched.'

His father, Tom, and brother, Stephen, 
travelled to Phuket for a Buddhist service and cremation last week and a
memorial football tournament in Thailand was also organised in his 
name by friends. Five teams took part.

The accident once again puts the safety 
of Thailand's roads in the spotlight.

Last year, school friends Conrad 
Quashie, 19, Max Boomgaarden-Cook, 20, and Bruno Melling-Firth, 19, were
killed instantly when the coach in which they were travelling was hit 
by a bus in the northern town of Chiang Mai.

And in January this year Christopher 
Nicholas Gibb, 31, was killed when riding a motorbike in Pattaya. 
Motorbikers in the country are particularly at risk - more than 11,000 
die annually.

The
Thai government has launched a drive to encourage the use of helmets as
part of a masterplan to hit a UN target of less than 10 deaths per 
100,000 people.

It is unclear whether Mr Hart was wearing a helmet.

Thousands of British holidaymakers flock to the Thai resort of Phuket every year
