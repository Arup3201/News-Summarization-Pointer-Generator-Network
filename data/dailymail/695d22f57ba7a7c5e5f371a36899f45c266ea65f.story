At least five protesters were shot dead in Syria today during a 'ceasefire' as thousands of demonstrators flooded the streets after Friday prayers.

Activists
said regime forces fired live bullets and tear gas in some locations, 
killing at least five people, but stood back in other areas where 
demonstrators beat drums and chanted anti-regime slogans.

Nervous world leaders were watching with bated breath to see if the fragile truce which began at 6am yesterday would hold.

'Ceasefire': Syrian soldiers patrol after Friday prayers in the Damascus suburb of Kafr Betna. Today three people were killed by forces loyal to President Assad

Forces loyal to President Assad shot dead at least one person Hama as demonstrators tried to converge on a central square, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

In the southern province of Deraa, where the uprising began, a man was shot dead as worshippers left a mosque in the town of Nawa.

A third man was killed in the town of Salqeen in the northwestern province of Idlib, activists said.

A major outbreak of violence at a 
chaotic rally could give government forces a pretext for ending the 
peace plan, which aims to calm a year-old uprising that has killed 9,000
people and pushed the country toward civil war.

The truce - which is just about holding - is at the centre of 
international envoy Kofi Annan's six-point plan to stop the slide toward
civil war and launch talks on a political transition.

Although the ceasefire has been 'relatively respected', the regime has ignored at least two major points in the plan - to send forces back to their barracks and to allow peaceful demonstrations.

Troops remain in towns and cities, and the regime insisted that demonstrators seek government permits.

Syria's state news agency SANA blamed two of the deaths on the opposition, saying an 'armed terrorist group' shot dead the man in Salqeen and they attributed the death of the Hama protester to a shot fired by a fellow demonstrator.

There were few reports of violence elsewhere, but activists said security forces were out in strength to prevent any major anti-Assad rallies around the country.

Assad's opponents had called for mass demonstrations to test whether the authorities would tolerate a return to peaceful protests, as Annan's six-point peace plan said they should.

Pockets of fighting were also reported near 
the Turkey-Syria border but the UN said the amnesty was generally being 
'relatively respected'.

An advance team of United Nations observers were standing ready to enter Syria to monitor the tense situation, a spokesman said.

Ahmad Fawzi said the team would 
prepare the way for a full mission of up to 250 observers on the ground 
if the UN Security Council gives approval as hoped when it meets later 
today.

He said the full
mission would help keep the peace 'if the ceasefire holds and it turns 
into a genuine cessation of hostilities'.

Syrian
forces tightened security in public squares and outside mosques on 
Friday after opposition leaders called for widespread protests.

Large anti-government protests were reported in several cities, 
including Deir al-Zour, on Thursday evening, and opposition groups have 
called for further demonstrations after Friday prayers, as has become 
the tradition.

Tense: But despite the protests, Syrian forces upped security in to deal with any violence that may break out

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Assad's ceasefire declaration was insincere and renewed a call for the creation of aid passages, without saying how these could be protected.

'I firmly believe the international community should live up to its responsibilities and create the conditions for humanitarian corridors so that these poor people who are being massacred can escape a dictator,' he told TV channel i>tele.

Sarkozy said he had discussed Syria with U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday and they had talked about sending in U.N. observers to verify compliance with the ceasefire.

The U.N. Security Council was to vote on the mission later today, with an advance party of 10 to 12 expected to reach Syria next week before the deployment of up to 250 monitors.

Mr Annan's spokesman expressed 
cautious optimism that the plan had been 'relatively respected' despite 
the continued presence of government troops and heavy weapons in 
population centres.

Earlier
today, Syrian troops fought rebels near the border with Turkey, and 
other scattered violence was reported, but the regime appeared to have 
halted its daily shelling attacks on opposition strongholds.

The
truce, the first brokered by the international community since the 
Syria crisis erupted 13 months ago, calls for the Syrian government to 
allow peaceful protests, and opposition activists urged supporters to 
take to the streets after Friday prayers to test the regime's 
compliance.

The Syrian 
government has broken promises in the past and so far ignored a key 
provision of Mr Annan's plan to pull troops back to barracks.
