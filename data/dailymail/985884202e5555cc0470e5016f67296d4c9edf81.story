The parents of a teenage swimming sensation have spoken of their pride after their daughter - who struggled to walk at the age of four - won a Commonwealth Games bronze medal.

Erraid Davies, 13, started swimming after developing a rare hip condition called Perthes' disease when she was three which prevented her playing most sports.

The youngster's determination has now made her a national hero after she became the youngest ever competitor from any country to win a Commonwealth Games medal.

What a star: Scotland's Erraid Davies, 13, holds her bronze medal on the podium after the 100m breaststroke SB9 final. Already the youngest athlete ever to represent Scotland, Erraid became the youngest competitor from any nation to win a Commonwealth Games medal

The Shetland's schoolgirl produced a storming comeback to take bronze in her 100m breaststroke race in front of a rapturous home crowd.

Her father David, 69, told the BBC: 'When she was four she could hardly walk. So the pool was the only thing that kept her fit.

'She swam her first mile before she was six. She's been swimming ever since and she's just got better and better.'

He added: 'She got into swimming because she developed a hip condition called Perthes' disease when she was three, and was told she was not to do any weight bearing exercises and that the best thing for her was to swim.

'We had just moved to Shetland and she couldn't swim, but she was soon taught and she has virtually never been out of the pool since.

'She trains in a 16 and 2/3 metre pool with three lanes nine times a week and once a week in a 25 metre pool.'

Already her country's youngest ever team member at a Commonwealth Games, she finished strongly just behind Australian silver medallist Madeleine Scott in one minute and 21.38 seconds, with New Zealand's Sophie Pascoe taking gold. 

Davies kept the fact she was spending her summer holidays in Glasgow a secret from her school friends, but suspects they will have found out about it now.

She said: 'They didn't know before I came here. I didn't really know how to tell them. I got a medal and I am so happy. I am feeling really, really happy.'

Asked if she had a big celebration after her win, the shy youngster said: 'Not particularly, I had my first Irn Bru of the games.'

Father David thinks the huge support from the home fans spurred his daughter on to win her medal.

He added: 'She's just got a great big grin on her face all the time now. She's very pleased with herself and very happy, as she should be. It's been an amazing day. She's just amazing.'

'Unfortunately we weren't in the best position to see her in the race in the morning so we could only see her on the video screen, but I just couldn't believe how fast she was going. I've never seen her swim as fast as that. 

'This evening we were in a much better position at the finish line, and it was just absolutely amazing to hear the noise.

'When she was coming out the noise was just tremendous and it just built up, and I don't think it could have been any more amazing if she won the gold.'

It was a first medal for the teenager and she made history by becoming the youngest ever medallist at a Commonwealth Games

Erraid didn't tell her friends at school she would be competing, saying: 'I didn't know how to tell them'

Lorraine Gifford, Davies's coach at her swimming club, Delting Dolphins, was ecstatic to watch the race she feels will launch a push for a place at the Olympics in two years' time.

Ms Gifford said: 'I was screaming at the telly. I'm known for being pretty loud but I'm sure she could hear me.

Perthes' disease is a condition in which the top of the thigh bone and the hip soften, affecting the hip joint.

It affects an estimated one in 9,000 children and experts are still unsure what causes it.

Children with the condition experience pain during certain types of physical activity and can develop a limp. Others can suffer from arthritis in later life.

Some children recover without treatment but others need to use a wheelchair or crutches and sometimes have to undergo an operation to re-shape the bone.

'I started coaching Erraid when she was eight. I did some lessons with her before.'

Both Andy Murray's mother, Judy, and Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond, were quick to take to their Twitter accounts and congratulate Erraid, who even began trending on the social networking site.

Judy Murray tweeted: 'Well done wee Erraid Davies. Just 13 and from the Shetland Islands. Bronze medal 100m Para breaststroke. How big was her smile? Adorable.'

First Minister Alex Salmond said: 'Congrats to Scotland's youngest-ever Commonwealth Games competitor Erraid Davies winning a brilliant Bronze.'

The youngster will now decide whether to compete in the Paralympic games in Rio in two years time. 

Davies's victory came as concerns arose about the swimming pool in Glasgow being used for the Games.

The moveable floor at Tollcross International Swimming Centre, in the Scottish city's east, became stuck the day before the Games began resulting in uneven depths.

Davies will now decide whether to try to compete in the Paralympic Games in Rio in two years' time 

Davies's bronze came after she was selected to carry the Glasgow 2014 Queen's Baton through Aith on the Shetland Islands earlier this year

It is two metres deep at the start and then rises up to 1.88 metres at the 12-metre mark, before dropping off down to two metres again.

Swimming governing body FINA only requires a depth of 1.35m for competitions that are not the Olympic Games or a world championships. 

Glasgow 2014 spokesperson Jackie Brock-Doyle told the Sydney Morning Herald the 50-metre pool is 'fully compliant'.

'We've discussed it with the FINA technical delegate. It's fully compliant with FINA rules for the Commonwealth Games,' Brock-Doyle said. 'There will be no impact on the competitors and records set here.'

Dutch company Variopool are behind the installation but they will not fix the pool mid-competition in case it ends up in a position that does effect FINA pool depth rules.
