A 98-year-old woman lost her bid to persuade a judge to erase her 1950 conviction for conspiracy to obstruct justice in the atomic spying trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

Miriam Moskowitz, of New Jersey, served two years in jail for lying to a grand jury as it investigated the Rosenbergs, who were convicted of passing nuclear weapons secrets to the Soviet Union.

On Thursday, 61 years after the Rosenbergs were executed, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein rejected Moskowitz's unusual request to clear her name.

Immediately after hearing oral arguments, he said her lawyers could not show that transcripts of grand jury statements by the lone witness against her would have changed her trial's result. 

Disappointed: Miriam Moskowitz, 98, accompanied by her nephew Ira Moskowitz, leaves federal court in New York on Thursday after a judge refused to declare her innocent of obstructing justice in the Rosenberg case

Convicted: Moskowitz is pictured with her business partner Abraham Brothman in a prison van after both were charged with conspiracy. She was fined $10,000 and jailed for two years. Brothman was jailed for seven years

As he left the bench, Hellerstein wished Moskowitz well and told her it was a pleasure to have her in his court. 

'OK, that's the end,' a cheerful Moskowitz, walking with a cane toward spectators, told a film crew that has been following her. 'You can finish your documentary now.'

Outside court, she said she was disappointed and referenced the McCarthy era, when fear of Communism was rampant in the United States and a blacklist made it hard for some to find work.

'Too bad,' Moskowitz said of Hellerstein's ruling. 'My 98-year-old life goes on, and it's not affected me one way or the other except I am disappointed because it reflects ... the prejudice of the McCarthy era.'

She added: 'The decision today doesn't help understand that era.'

Executed: Julius (left) and Ethel Rosenberg (right) were executed in 1953 after being found guilty of passing nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union. Cables have confirmed Julius' involvement but shed doubt on Ethel's

National news: The controversial espionage case was one of the most lengthy and complicated in US history

Guilty: She served two years in prison for allegedly lying to a grand jury investigating the Rosenbergs 

Rejected: A judge said the suggestion that information was withheld during her trial was not enough proof  

The government had opposed Moskowitz's request, saying her conviction was supported by the evidence and that she conspired with two men to lie to a grand jury investigating allegations of atomic espionage.

'Her claims, even if taken at face value, are insufficient to establish an error under today's law, let alone the law when she was convicted in 1950,' prosecutors said in court papers.

Moskowitz's lawyers said FBI and grand jury statements by the key government witness against her — Harry Gold — were withheld from the defense. 

They said the papers showed that Gold repeatedly told the FBI that Moskowitz was unaware of plans by others to lie before the grand jury until the government threatened him with the death penalty.

Moving on: Moskowitz told a documentary team following her that this signaled the end of her journey 

Lengthy battle: The New Jersey-based woman blames McCarthy-era prejudice for her conviction 

The Rosenbergs, convicted of passing nuclear weapons secrets to the Soviet Union, were executed in 1953

Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Allen told Hellerstein on Thursday that the jury heard statements at trial that were similar to statements Moskowitz's lawyers claim are new. 

Gold served about half of a 30-year prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to violating the espionage act. 

Since then, decoded Soviet cables have appeared to confirm that Julius Rosenberg was a spy, but doubts have remained about Ethel Rosenberg's involvement.

Ethel, an actress, singer and secretary, was 37 when she died. Electrical engingeer Julius was 35 when he died.
