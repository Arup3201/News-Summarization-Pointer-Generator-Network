Cliven Bundy, a Nevada cattle rancher, has become something of a celebrity in his frontier stronghold since his showdown over land with federal authorities earlier this month.

Officials had tried to round up Bundy's cattle and evict him on April 12 after 20 years of not paying taxes. However they were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people, some of them armed with sniper rifles, turned up and threatened to open fire.

The incident has propelled Bundy into a position of authority among those who believe that they are being harassed by an 'overreaching' federal government. Bundy has leapt on to this platform, holding daily news conferences next to the armed checkpoint on the driveway of his ranch.

On Saturday he made a rambling speech littered with racist remarks to a gathering made up of local supporters and a few scattered members of the press.

During his speech, Bundy shared a story of driving through a housing project in Las Vegas, according to a report by the New York Times, beginning his tale with the words: 'I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro.'

He said: 'In front of that 
government house the door was usually open and the older people and the 
kids - and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the
 porch - they didn’t have nothing to do. They didn’t have nothing for 
their kids to do. They didn’t have nothing for their young girls to do.

'And
 because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they 
do? They abort their young children, they put their young 
men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton.

And I’ve 
often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having
 a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government
 subsidy? They didn’t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.'

Mr Bundy, a 67-year-old father-of 14 and registered Republican, is
 accused of not paying federal grazing taxes for his cattle for 20 
years, and reportedly owes the government $1million.

A federal taskforce
 has been setup to deal with him, Senate majority leader and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid said last week, branding Bundy a 'domestic terrorist'. 

The Bureau of Land Management tried to round up Bundy's cattle earlier this month but were forced to back down after hundreds of supporters, some carrying automatic weapons and sniper rifles, threatened violence.

Reid accused the militia supporting Reid of deliberately putting women and children into the firing line so that, in the event of violence, they got hurt first ensuring the worst possible headlines.

Meanwhile Bundy has warned that he will never back down down from his fight.

'They will come, and I don't care,' he told MailOnline earlier this month. 'The people and citizens of America will win this fight. We have God on our side and we will be better prepared for them next time.'

He said supporters from across the U.S., many of the armed a prepared to defend themselves, were heading for the remote town of Bunkersville, about 80 miles from Las Vegas in southern Nevada.

He said: 'People have been mobilized by what they have seen and heard and they will come here because they see it as their right to defend the land.'

Bundy won the first round of his fight with agents from the Bureau of Land 
Management after they released several hundred cows they had seized as 
part of a long running dispute over grazing rights in Nevada.

Craig Leff, from the Bureau of Land Management, told the Times: 'The gather is now over. Our focus is pursuing this matter 
administratively and judicially.'

Fears
 of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped 
out in a field leading to Bundy's ranch led federal officials to call 
off their operation.

Supporters
 of Bundy hailed the decision as a victory - but the decision was taken 
in part because Clark County Sheriff's feared violence could erupt at 
any moment.

Many
 of the militia, who wore camouflage clothing and stalked the roads 
around the Bundy home carrying automatic weapons,said they were prepared
 to take on the federal agents in a fire fight.

One was overheard boasting that he had two agent in his gun sight and could 'take them down'.

The
 dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he 
stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze 
public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave 
Desert tortoise.

Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years.

The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle.

Last week, they began an operation to seize his cattle prompting the stand off and mini invasion by militia members from California, Arizona, Montana and Utah to rush to his support.

Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy.

It has not been revealed if Bundy would pay the estimated $1.2million he owes to the Government.

The dispute that ultimately triggered the roundup dates to 1993, when the bureau cited concern for the federally protected tortoise in the region.

The bureau revoked Bundy's grazing rights after he stopped paying grazing fees and disregarded federal court orders to remove his animals.

The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states' rights and federal land-use policy.
