A 33-year-old woman has been charged with rape after she allegedly had a child with the boy, 15, whom she molested.

Janelle Denise Goforth, 33, was accused of statutory rape and child molestation of the teenager, who cannot be identified.

Goforth, of Decatur in Dekalb County, Georgia, was charged at the county jail on Tuesday.

The mother-of-seven was released after posting bond on Wednesday.

The teenage boy's aunt, who became his legal guardian after his mother's death, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Gorforth was found to be having an inappropriate sexual relationship with the teenager last April.

Tia Stephens, 30, said Goforth told her the boy claimed he was 18. Miss Stephens corrected her, saying her nephew was just 15 years old.

Miss Stephens believed the relationship was over until January when Goforth's mother informed her that the woman was about to give birth and the child's father was her nephew.

The baby boy, Anthony, is her seventh child. Goforth's mother cares for five of the children and her aunt and uncle were caring for the sixth infant and the newborn baby.

Miss Stephens told wsbtv.com: 'The baby looks just like my nephew.

'But she’s still wrong. I want her to be treated as if 
she was a male and it was a 15-year-old girl. It’s no difference to me.'

Miss Stephens has demanded a DNA test to confirm that the baby belongs to her nephew.
