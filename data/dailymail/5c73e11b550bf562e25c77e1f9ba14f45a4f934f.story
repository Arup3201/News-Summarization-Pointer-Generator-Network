Parts of Britain have been hit by flooding today after storms lashed the country again overnight dumping half a month's rainfall in just 24 hours.

Two flood warnings are now in place in East Anglia and 15 flood alerts have been issued by the Environment Agency with the dismal spell of October weather set to continue.  

A number of villagers were trapped in their homes after the main road flooded in Alconbury Weston in Cambridgeshire after the River Great Ouse burst its banks.

The water was waist deep in parts of Alconbury Weston, Cambridgeshire, covering park benches and bins and submerging a ford on the road

Gusts of up to 40mph resulted in heavy seas off Hartlepool where huge waves could be seen crashing over the Heugh breakwater (pictured)

Forecast: There will be rain in many parts of the South over the next three days, with cloudy and sunny spells in the Midlands and North

Park benches were submerged and a van got stuck after it tried to drive down the flooded street, which was waist-high in some places.

'It's the worst flooding I have seen here in five years. It was fine when I went to bed, but when I woke up the road was like a river,' said villager Peter Williams.

In Hertfordshire the Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School in Ware has been shut due to flooding and fire crews have been helping people stuck in cars in Stevenage and Wadesmill.

Much of the country was hit by heavy rain and gusts of up to 40mph yesterday and this evening it will continue to be showery and cloudy in the South and East of England

Two flood warnings are now in place in East Anglia and 15 flood alerts have been issued by the Environment Agency, including in the South East and the Midlands

Much of the country was hit by heavy rain and gusts of up to 40mph yesterday and this evening it will continue to be showery and cloudy in the South and East of England. 

Tomorrow will see a North and South divide as the North stays dry, but rain moves across the country from the South West bringing showers in the South and parts of Wales.

More showers and windy weather is expected on Thursday across the whole country, but Friday should be more settled, with some dry and sunny spells.

Although the weather is expected to be warmer over the weekend, there is no guarantee that it will be dry with wet weather set to return on Saturday and Sunday in Scotland and Western areas

The weather is also expected to feel warmer at the end of the week, with possible highs of 21C in London on Friday.

But the wet weather is set to return for the weekend, with heavy rain forecast for Scotland and Western areas.

'Some places will have seen half a month's rainfall in the last 24 hours, but the rain is now petering off,' said Laura Young, of the Met Office.

'We've had a good run of fine weather and now we are seeing typical Autumnal weather.

'The weekend is looking unsettled but the exact detail is unknown at the moment. It will be windy everywhere but we don't yet know if the showers will stay in the South West or spread.'

Hayfever sufferers face autumn misery with imminent warm weather threatening a spate of itchy eyes and runny noses.

Levels of fungal spores in the air are set to rise from 'low' to 'moderate' in parts of Britain later this week.

Doctors are already seeing more patients needing medication when numbers should have started to drop by now, they said.

And with an Indian summer likely to push temperatures to 21C (70F) by the weekend, Britons are bracing themselves for things to get worse.

Nottingham-based GP Dr Ian Campbell said: 'I have seen more hayfever patients coming for their medication than usual at this time of year.

'I saw a family just this week who were sneezing, I don't know why this is, it is very unusual especially as it has been quite wet recently.

'I don't recall it being this bad last year, hayfever is a problem in August and into September but this far into October is very unusual.'

The Met Office said pollen and fungal spore counts are expected to remain at moderate levels in parts of the country until Friday.

The problem this year has been made worse by a growth spurt of Ragweed, a plant native to the United States which after invading Britain filled the air with highly allergenic pollen grains.

The plant is rarely found in the UK as it requires warm weather before the first winter frost to survive.

But experts say this year has been ideal because of the long summer and extended warm weather into autumn.

The Met Office said two types of fungal spores - Cladosporium and Sporobolomyces - are the most abundant with levels only likely to drop when the weather gets colder.

Allergy UK's scientific director Dr Jean Emberlin said: 'At this time of year there are fungal spores in the air but very few places measure this so we have to go on the weather.

'Levels of spores rise in warm and dry weather, and although they affect fewer people than pollen in the summer there will be those suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis as a result.

'The message is that people should not assume they have a cold if they find themselves sneezing but that it might be an allergy, and cold medicine will not help if it is.'
