A Tory Minister is involved in an extraordinary row over claims that taxpayers’ money was used to fund gay sex parties.

The politician is said to have been in a feud with a senior party official accused of using dating app Grindr to invite gay MPs and activists to his suite at the Conservative Party conference.

The £70,000-a-year official, who is not an MP, has also been accused of bullying staff and being drunk on duty. He was disciplined after a formal investigation.

The £2,500 per night Manchester hotel where the orgy is said to have taken place

Neither the Minister nor the official can be named by The Mail on Sunday for legal reasons.

The gay sex party is alleged to have taken place at the Light ApartHotel, a luxury apartment complex in Manchester where suites cost up to £2,500 a night.

It is just over half a mile from the Manchester Central conference centre and is popular with footballers and WAGs. The complex can be entered by driving straight into the underground car park, escaping the attentions of the paparazzi.

The official was among a group of Tory aides who stayed there during the conference in 2011 with the bill being footed by a taxpayer-funded organisation. The Tory official organised the party using the Grindr app, which enables users to make contact with fellow gay men in the vicinity.

After a series of intimate exchanges with another man, he invited him to a party in his hotel suite. It is alleged that other men were later invited.

According to one source, the official boasted he was a senior figure in the Tory Party.

A source, who has seen the Grindr messages, said: ‘The gist of it was, “I’m up here with the Tory Party and have some great young guys in my suite. We party every night, come and join us.”

‘The other man responded very enthusiastically and said he was also involved in politics so they had lots in common.’

Shortly after the conference, a formal complaint was made to the party by an individual who saw the Grindr exchanges between the named official and the other man, who did not disclose his identity.

A Tory insider said: ‘It was clear from the investigation that the official had behaved very foolishly and he was given a formal warning.

‘But it was decided to take no further action. The identity of the other man in the Grindr messages was not disclosed in the inquiry.’

The result of the investigation was reported to Downing Street.

The Mail on Sunday has also learned that in the run-up to the 2011 Tory conference, the same official was involved in a separate incident when the Conservative politician involved in the feud asked him to approve a big pay rise for one of his friends, who worked for the the official.

The official refused, insisting that because the Tory body that he and the Minister’s friend worked for receives public funds they had to follow Mr Cameron’s call for public-sector workers to receive low pay rises in line with the Coalition’s austerity policies. Tory chiefs backed the official and told the Minister to stop making a fuss.

The Minister allegedly complained vehemently again when the same male junior aide was passed over for promotion and ‘raved and ranted about it in front of other Tory officials causing an embarrassing scene’.

The claims were disclosed following a Mail on Sunday investigation amid speculation at Westminster that a new sleaze scandal involving Tory MPs, sex, abuse of power, bullying and personal feuds is about to be exposed.

A parliamentary insider said some of the ‘outlandish and sinister’ claims and counter claims were reminiscent of the TV political drama House Of Cards about the plots, sexual intrigue and vendettas in the Westminster underworld.

David Cameron has been warned the allegations could inflict major damage on his party’s reputation. Commons Speaker John Bercow, who is responsible for the conduct of all MPs and staff at Westminster, is planning emergency talks with senior MPs this week in attempt to defuse the crisis.

Last week, the Speaker sent all MPs a copy of an ‘anti-bullying charter’ designed to protect Commons staff who claim they have been ‘harassed’ by MPs or officials. He is furious that his demand for a ‘helpline’ to allow MPs’ staff to report bullying and harassment was rejected by all three main parties.

The charter says they must stop all forms of ‘harassment – unwanted conduct that violates people’s dignity’ while ‘remarks based on race, gender, sexual orientation and gender reassignment’  are banned.’

One official said: ‘There has been concern for some time over some MPs with a conspicuously high turnover of staff.’
