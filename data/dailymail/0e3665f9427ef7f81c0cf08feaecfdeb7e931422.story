Rare home movie footage of Douglas Bader, the inspirational Second World War pilot who battled Nazi Germany even after losing his legs, is to go on show to the public for the first time.

Bader, Britain’s best-known fighter ace, lost his legs in a pre-war flying accident and was invalided out of the Royal Air Force.

When war broke out he persuaded medical officers to let him rejoin and was soon taking to the skies in Spitfire and Hurricane fighters as the RAF defended Britain from Germany’s Luftwaffe in the summer of 1940.

Fighter: Douglas Bader, the pilot who fought with the RAF despite having prosthetic legs. Rare footage of him has gone on display at an exhibition

A new exhibition at the Imperial War 
Museum’s Duxford site, near Cambridge, will show an amateur black and 
white film shot by his RAF colleague, Group Captain George ‘Sammy’ 
Sampson, who served as a pilot and instructor at Duxford between 1931 
and 1933.

In the film a relaxed Bader is shown participating in a treasure hunt with other officers and their wives.

In
 another sequence he is shown walking out of Duxford’s officers’ mess in
 civilian clothes and giving a jaunty salute to the camera.

A hero to most of his men, Bader flew with 222 Squadron ahead of the Dunkirk evacuation

The
 images are a far cry from the better known pictures of the rambunctious
 Bader, who would later retire from the RAF as a Group Captain and shot 
down 20 enemy aircraft during the war.

He
 achieved national celebrity after the publication of Paul Brickhill’s 
book Reach For The Sky, which was turned into a 1956 feature film 
starring Kenneth More as Bader.

Bader,
 who died aged 72 in 1982, lost his legs in 1931 and left the air force 
at Duxford having been told he would never fly again.

But
 he returned in 1940 to fly Spitfires with 19 Squadron. He said: ‘The 
fact that I left the Royal Air Force at Duxford and I came back into it 
at Duxford, through the same bloody gate, is what comes to mind.’

A
 hero to most of his men, Bader flew with 222 Squadron ahead of the 
Dunkirk evacuation. He was then sent to command 242 Squadron, a 
Hurricane unit that had suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of 
France.

Bader rapidly won his jaded aircrew over with a display of daring aerobatics at their base at RAF Coltishall near Norwich.

The
 squadron was soon back in the thick of the Battle of Britain and was 
regularly posted to Duxford to join up with other fighters.

Often
 described as determined and dogmatic or fearless and eager for a 
challenge, Bader produced mixed reactions among his RAF peers.

Flight Sergeant George Unwin – who 
was nicknamed ‘Grumpy’ by Bader after he rebuked the legless pilot for 
making too much noise taking his artificial limbs off – described his 
former colleague on 19 Squadron as ‘outstanding’.

‘He inspired you,’ Unwin said, ‘he was not just two tin legs.’

But
 the comments of another former Duxford pilot shed some light on Bader’s
 sometimes controversial personality. ‘He was not everybody’s cup of 
tea,’ said Gordon Sinclair.

A former technician describes how Bader shouted at him for daring to step on to the wing of his aircraft with muddy boots on.

He was knighted in 1976 for his work with disabled people through The Douglas Bader Foundation

Bader
 was forced to bail out of his Spitfire over France in 1941 while 
leading another wing based at RAF Tangmere in Sussex and became a 
prisoner of war.

While 
leaping from his aircraft Bader lost one of his artificial legs. After 
his Germans captors gave special permission, pledging they would not 
shoot down a delivery aircraft, a replacement was dropped from the air. 
Bader promptly tried to escape.

Steve Woolford, head of 
interpretations and collections at Imperial War Museum Duxford, said 
Bader was an ‘incredible character as a man’.

‘His story still grips people today. Opinions about him range from heroic individual to a difficult man,’ he added.

‘As a combat leader he was a controversial figure within the RAF both as a personality and in terms of his ideas about air fighting.’

Bader was a proponent of the ‘Big Wing’, a huge formation of aircraft involving several squadrons of fighters which he believe should be sent aloft en masse from 12 Group aerodromes north of London to shoot down enemy bombers with a knockout blow.

This was at odds with the tactics employed by the rival 11 Group, led by Sir Keith Park, and which covered south east England and was the immediate line of defence against aerial attackers. The debate over the Big Wing tactics persists to this day.

He was knighted in 1976 for his work with disabled people through The Douglas Bader Foundation.
