The New England Patriots' cheerleaders reduced a  player of the opposite team to tears when they paid tribute to his young daughter who is battling  cancer.

Devon Still's daughter Leah, four, was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma in June, and the Patriots' cheerleaders showed their support when they played the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.

Instead of their normal red, white and blue outfits, the Patriots' cheerleaders donned Still's Bengals jersey, a  tribute which reduced the 25-year-old defensive tackle to tears on the field.

Showing support: The New England Patriots' cheerleaders wear the jerseys of Cincinnati Bengals player Devon Still as a tribute to his daughter Leah who is battling stage 4 cancer

A father's love: Devon Still, 25, with his daughter Leah, 4, who is being treated for Stage 4 neuroblastoma and has been given a 50-50 chance of survival

Still has not been able to devote himself fully to football since Leah was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma in June this year.

Initially missing out on Cincinnati's 53-man roster so he could be by his daughter's side, Still was then offered a spot on the practice squad, ensuring Leah would be covered under the team's health insurance policy.

He went public with his daughter's cancer diagnosis 'not for sympathy,' he wrote on Instagram, but 'because I've come to the point where I no longer [am] feeling sorry but [want] to ask that y'all keep my daughter in your prayers...

'The more prayers that go up, the more faith we [have] that she will overcome this obstacle,' he wrote.

'if y'all know me y'all know this girl is my world...I know that she is strong and she won't let anything hold her down without a fight.'

#LeahStrong: The moving tribute by the Patriots' cheerleaders to his daughter reduced Stills to tears

Fighting: Still posted a video of himself giving Leah a peptalk ahead of major surgery, which then went viral

Still has set up a donation program encouraging people to pledge money for every sack the Bengals' defense gets this season in an effort to help raise money and awareness about pediatric cancer.

'Kids always look up to their parents, but in just a matter of a week that all reversed for me,' Still wrote on the campaign page

'I can honestly say I truly look up to my daughter now. In the four years of life she has had, she has been through way more than I have in 24. Her courage, strength, and high spirits through it all is nothing short of inspirational.

'So I am dedicating my season to her and inspiring others like she has inspired me.'

Last week, Still posted a video of him giving Leah a pep talk before she went into surgery to remove a cancerous tumor which went viral.

Charity works: The Cincinnati Bengals have been donating the proceedings from the sales of Still's jersey to cancer research and the hospital where Leah is receiving treatment

Raising awareness: Sales of Still's jersey - seen on the Patriots' cheerleaders on Sunday - raised $400,000 in support for cancer research and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital in the first four days it was on sale

Uniform support: Before donning Still's jersery, the Patriots' cheerleaders wore  pink to acknowledge Breast Cancer Awareness Month

However, Still made it clear that Leah still faced a long road ahead, as the little girl will require further treatments to remove the cancer in her bone marrow.

He Tweeted: 'Just to clear up some rumors...my daughter is NOT cancer free..today was a big step towards that but still a long road ahead.

'She has stage 4 which means the cancer spread to her bone marrow which we hope will be removed with her next couple of treatments.'

The Cincinnati Bengals announced last month that they would donate 100 per cent of the proceeds from sales of Still’s No 75 jersey in support for cancer research and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital.

Still's jersey sold more in its first 24 hours than any other Bengals jersey had in a single day and raised $400,000 in the first four days the jersey was on sale

Sunday’s game ended in a victory for the New England Patriots to a dominant 43-17 victory over previously unbeaten Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.
