The infamous founder of WikiLeaks is reportedly launching a fashion label to cash on his notoriety and rebellious image.

Julian Assange, an Australian, is working on a range of clothes for Indian customers in partnership with local company Franchisee India.

'India is one of the countries where awareness about WikiLeaks is the highest and Julian is excited about the proposition,' Olafur Vignir Sigurvinsson, an Iceland-based WikiLeaks representative, told the Times of India.

Fashion revolutionary? WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is reportedly launching a fashion line in India

Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, when the UK decided to extradite him to Sweden where he is wanted on charges of sexual assault

It is believed the line will feature a stylised image of Assange's face, similar to clothing featuring the face of South American revolutionary Che Guevara.

The 43-year-old co-founded WikiLeaks in 2006 and shot to fame in 2010 when it published U.S. military and diplomatic documents leaked by U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning.

He has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, when the UK decided to extradite him to Sweden where he is wanted on charges of sexual assault.

It is believed the line will feature a stylised image of Assange's face, similar to clothing featuring the face of South American revolutionary Che Guevara.

Last month Assange found a way to escape asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy, and preach his causes, without getting arrested by British authorities.

He used hologram technology to appear on Sunday for a speech at The Nantucket Project, a Massachusetts innovation conference.

The 43-year-old Australian native has been able to speak at several events from his self-imposed house arrest thanks to Skype, but the event marked the first time he has appeared as a hologram.

The hologram transmission was organised from inside the Ecuadorian Embassy by London-based British billionaire Alki David, whose company Hologram USA owns the technology which made the transmission possible.
