Neil Warnock has revealed he failed in a bid to bring Tottenham striker Harry Kane to Crystal Palace at the start of the season.

The Eagles boss takes his side to White Hart Lane on Saturday to face a Spurs team buoyed by the goals of Kane so far this campaign.

The England Under 21 international has struck 11 goals for Mauricio Pochettino's men but has only established himself in Tottenham's Premier League side in the last month.

Until then he was used sparingly as a substitute and restricted to playing a key role in the Europa League group stages - the main reason Warnock felt a loan move for Kane never got off the ground.

'I tried to get him a few times when I came here,' the 66-year-old said.

'He is a good lad and you know what you are going to get with him. He is an exciting player. His first thought when he gets the ball is positive and I like players like that, who commit defenders. He obviously enjoys it, you can tell by the smile on his face. He is a good asset.

Eagles boss Neil Warnock was disappointed to miss out on England Under 21 international Kane 

'At the time, he was not involved and we felt there was a chance of getting him on loan. But unfortunately they were in that horrible cup on a Thursday night.'

Kane came close to breaking the deadlock as Spurs lost 3-0 at league leaders Chelsea on Wednesday night and is likely to retain his place for the visit of Palace, who also go into the contest on the back of a defeat having lost 1-0 at home to Aston Villa.

Midfielder Joe Ledley missed that game with a hip problem and is a doubt for the trip to Tottenham - as is defender Damien Delaney.

Warnock admitted he has already drawn up a list of January transfer targets and, having missed out on Kane, it is a forward - with Andy Johnson and Kevin Doyle injured and Dwight Gayle replaced at half-time against Villa through illness - that he hopes to bring in.

'I think we know we haven't got enough fire-power,' he added.

'When you look at the other teams they have all got main strikers to select from. I think the lads are doing as well as they can. We do need improvement in that area and we are looking to address that in January.'
