Last night, an audience of four billion people witnessed the lighting of the Olympic flame at the climax of a dazzling Opening Ceremony, marking the start of the 30th Summer Games in London.

Athletes from all corners of the globe were cheered by a 60,000-strong crowd in a rapturous reception which will never be erased from their memories.

While the majority of Britain's 541 athletes were present to enjoy the show, there were some who sadly couldn't be there.

Triple sailing gold medallist Ben Ainslie lights the Olympic flame in a mini version of the Opening Ceremony held in Weymouth and Portland Harbour today

But Ainslie didn't stand on ceremony for long, taking part in the final Finn class practice race in Weymouth Bay. The white chalk horse of Osmington Hill can be seen in the background

But not wanting to miss out on the 
magical moment the flame is lit, our sailors held their own mini opening
ceremony on the waterfront in Weymouth today.

In
the real thing, the honour of igniting the cauldron was given to 
Britain's athletes of tomorrow, but it was a superstar of the past and 
present who did the honours here.

Ben
Ainslie will begin his pursuit of an unprecedented fourth straight 
Olympic gold medal and fifth medal overall tomorrow when he steers his 
Finn onto Weymouth Bay.

Success
at the quaint seaside resort favoured by King George III this week will
make the 35-year-old the most successful sailor in Olympic history.

But
while most attention will be lavished on Ainslie, Britain boasts a 
whole roster of potential medal winners in an event that is 
traditionally among their strongest.

The
whole squad lined up to welcome the Olympic flame under gorgeous blue 
skies in Weymouth, before taking to the waves to run through final 
practice sessions before the races begin.

Team
GB sailing leader Stephen Park believes no other country can match 
Britain's strength in depth and said there is every chance we will see 
medallists in all ten classes.

When rating Ainslie's chances, Park doesn't mince his words: 'I think that everybody expects Ben will win a gold medal.

'If
he sails his normal game, there is no reason why he shouldn't. He 
dominated the recent world championships and I think the rest of the 
fleet are racing for second.'

The English weather was kind on the Brazilian Star crew of Bruno Prada and Robert Scheidt. The crystal clear blue skies of Saturday in Weymouth are unlikely to last all week, however

Ainslie just wants to get on with the proper business of racing after the long Olympic build-up.

He said after practice today: 'I am ready to go. I am looking forward to racing and hope things go well.

'It was good out there today. It was a great breeze, perfect sailing conditions.

'It is an interesting course that medal race course. It is pretty tricky so tomorrow starting off will be a tough race.

'It
is cramped out there. I think you've just got to be more prepared for 
the difficult conditions and know it won't be perfect. You've just got 
to deal with it and prepare for a bit of a scrap.'

Tomorrow's
two races in the Finn class will see Ainslie tackle the Nothe Course, 
which is the medal race course, and then the Weymouth Bay West course.
