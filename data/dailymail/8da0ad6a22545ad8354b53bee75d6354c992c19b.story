Birthday girl: Michelle Porter, 37, from London, 
was badly injured when her yacht was hit by a 'monumental' wave off the 
coast of South Africa

It's a birthday she won't soon forget.

Just when she should have been blowing the out candles on her cake, British sailor Michelle Porter was clinging on for dear life after her yacht was struck by a 'monumental' wave.

The boat was caught in hurricane-force gusts off the coast of South Africa as she and fellow crew took part in the Clipper round-the-world race.

Ms Porter, from London, was evacuated to a hospital in Port Elizabeth on Saturday - the day she turned 37.

It was feared she may have broken her arm, but a medical examination found she had miraculously escaped with torn ligaments and severe bruising.

In a statement issued by the race organisers, Ms Porter said: 'It's certainly a birthday I won't be forgetting anytime soon and for the wrong reasons.

'I feel a bit numb, a bit sick, and also pretty devastated that I've had to leave the yacht.'

Ms Porter, who hopes to rejoin the yacht in Australia, added: 'I sailed with it from London and I'm pretty gutted that I'm not doing this leg.'

Ian Gray, the station commander of the National Sea Rescue Station in Port Elizabeth, said its crews had rendezvoused with the yacht five miles from the harbour.

'We came alongside to put a crew member on board and the patient was found to be uncomfortable, in some pain, but in good spirits,' he said.

'We managed to transfer the casualty onto the seven-metre rescue boat.

'From there we were able to transfer her to the larger craft where she'd be more comfortable and then brought her back to the harbour.'

Recalling the incident in which she was hurt, Ms Porter said: 'We've been hit by quite a lot of waves over the last few days but this one was pretty monumental.

'I was tagged onto the high side by my safety line and just didn't see the wave coming.

'The next thing I knew I was clinging onto the rails on the low side.

'Had it not been for my safety line I would have been straight overboard.'

The 11-month race began in London in September and the fleet of 12 boats taking part have so far completed around a quarter of the 40,000-mile course.
