A toddler died after getting caught in the cord of a window blind, which strangled her, as she played a game of hide and seek with her older brother.

Two-year-old Sophie Allen died in hospital on Saturday, five days after her mother Danielle Hudson, found her lifeless daughter in her bedroom.

The 28-year-old today warned other parents of the dangers posed by window blind cords.

Sophie and her brother Jayden, four, were playing a game of hide and seek at the family's Sunderland home on Easter Monday.

Tragic: Two-year-old Sophie Allen died in hospital on Saturday, after becoming entangled in a window blind cord while playing hide and seek with her older brother

Mother-of-three Miss Hudson said she was oblivious to what had happened, until her son told her that Sophie was stuck.

When he came back a second time saying the same thing, Miss Hudson went to investigate.

She found her daughter lying lifeless with the beaded loop cord tangled around her neck.

Her partner, Sophie's father, performed CPR while Miss Hudson dialled 999.

Paramedics took her to Sunderland Royal Hospital where she was put in an induced coma, but but she died in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Speaking for the first time about the ordeal Danielle recalled the awful moment she realised something was wrong.

She said: 'My son came in and said "Sophie's stuck" and pointed at the cupboard. I didn't understand what he meant and just thought she was hiding.

'Then he came back and said it again. I walked over to the window and saw a shadow behind the curtain.

'I pulled it open and she was hanging with the cord around her neck.

'I lifted her up and carried her downstairs and her dad Peter tried to do CPR, while I called for an ambulance.'

Sophie was taken to Sunderland Royal Hospital, where staff worked for more than an hour to resuscitate her.

'She was loving and happy, always smiling'

She was then transferred to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where she was placed in an induced coma.

Miss
 Hudson added: 'They brought her out of the coma after 48 hours and she 
started to breathe on her own, but there was no response to touch or 
sound.

'The next day she 
had an MRI scan which showed brain damage from the lack of oxygen. They 
said that even if she pulled through she would be severely 
brain-damaged.

'On Friday she had an EEG and it showed no brain activity at all.

'They said that once they took her off the ventilator she would struggle to breathe eventually, and she died on Saturday morning at about 3.20am.'

Sophie's mother has now warned other parents about the dangers of such a common household feature.

She said: 'Blinds are something that practically every household has.

'Just
 tie them out of the way, keep them out of reach of children, cut them 
or take them down altogether. Just make sure children have no access to 
them.'

Sophie's siblings have been staying with relatives since the accident and only returned home at the weekend.

Danielle described her daughter, who would have been three in December, as a happy but mischievous little girl.

She said: 'Sophie was always dirty, you couldn't keep her clean. She was loving and happy, always smiling.

'I want to thank the paramedic team and staff in the hospital. If it wasn't for them, we would never have got the chance to say goodbye.'

The family say they would also like to thank Sunderland Royal hospital emergency department, all the doctors who tried to help and the paramedics who got her to hospital.

Miss Hudson said: 'Without all of that we would never have got the chance to say goodbye.'
