Reports of the 'death of Facebook' have been ‘greatly exaggerated’, according to a major market researcher.

A recent article by a University College of London professor made headlines when he said many teenagers thought Facebook was uncool and the social network was ‘dead and buried’ to them.

But a study about social media that claims to be ‘the biggest of its kind’ has found that Facebook’s decline among young people has been overstated and it remains the most popular social network around the world.

A new study has found that teen usage of Facebook has seen a small decline, but there is little evidence to suggest that the social network is 'dead and buried' as suggested by a previous UCL study. This chart shows the percentage change in millions of active users of all ages, between Q2 and Q4 2013

Tom Smith, founder and chief executive of Singapore and UK-based market research firm GlobalWebIndex, which conducted the study, said the real picture is more complex than teens ditching Facebook in their droves.

‘While teen usage of Facebook has seen a small decline, there is strikingly little evidence to suggest that UCL’s findings are representative of broader trends,’ he said.

Unlike the relatively small UCL study, GlobalWebIndex’s research was based on 170,000 online interviews across 32 countries, representing 89 per cent of the global Internet population.

World domination: A study about social media that claims to be 'the biggest of its kind' has found that Facebook's decline among young people has been overstated and it remains the most popular social network around the world

‘We’ve been able to show that Facebook is still used by 48.5 per cent of 16 to 19-year-olds globally on a monthly basis,’ said Mr Smith.

Facebook is still the dominant, most popular social network on the planet among teens with 67 per cent more active teen users than the nearest competitor, YouTube, which is regularly used by 29 per cent of 16 to 19-year-olds, he said.

Twitter is third most popular social network with 26 per cent of 16 to 19-year-olds around the world using it on a monthly basis.

‘Our GlobalWebIndex Social study shows that reports of ‘the death of Facebook’ have been greatly exaggerated,’ Mr Smith said.

The research also showed usage rates of Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit have all increased, demonstrating how diverse and competitive social networking has become.

Use of networking and messaging apps rose strongly too. The estimated audience size for WeChat rose by 379 per cent, with SnapChat increasing its user base by 54 per cent. Video clip network Vine has also more than doubled in popularity.

Though more than 50 per cent of active users on the top social platforms are aged between 16 and 34, it is the 25 to 34-year-olds rather than the 16 to 24-year-olds who make up the largest share of users on nearly all of the social networks surveyed.

The number of people using social network apps on their phones and tablets is still slightly less than those accessing the websites on their PCs and laptops, but mobile networkers are among the most frequent visitors and active users of the networking services - with iPhone users being particularly engaged.

The study looked at which social networks people had dormant and active accounts

The number of people using social network apps on their phones and tablets is still slightly less than those accessing the websites on their PCs and laptops, but mobile networkers are among the most frequent visitors and active users of the networking services – with iPhone users being particularly engaged.

A total of 69 per cent of people accessed Facebook using its official app on their smartphone or tablet in the past month, with 57 per cent of people using YouTube’s app and 37 per cent of people using a Google+ account on a mobile device.

Once again, newer video and messaging apps, such as What’s App, WeChat, SnapChat and Vine, which are designed to be used on mobile devices rather than computers, pulled in the most users compared to 2013 figures.

Emerging internet markets are the most socially engaged, with Indonesia topping the list with 97per cent of internet users having an account on Facebook and 83 per cent using a Google+ account.
