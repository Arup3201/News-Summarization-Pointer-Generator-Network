Gasping for fresh air as she was pulled out alive from the ruins of a clothing factory 17 days after it collapsed around her, worker Reshma Begum was hailed as ‘the miracle woman’.

Now the seamstress, whose extraordinary survival story made headlines around the world last month, is accused of being part of a massive hoax.

Miss Begum was dramatically discovered among the tangled steel and concrete of the Bangladesh garment factory, where clothes were manufactured by suppliers for high street brands including Primark.

Lies? A man claiming to be a colleague of Reshma Begum, the woman who was dramatically pulled from the rubble of the Bangladesh clothing factory collapse, claims her inspiring rescue is a fabrication

Its collapse is considered to be the deadliest garment factory accident in history.

But a co-worker is now accusing the 
19-year-old of faking the length of time she had been trapped in the 
ruins, and being part of a hoax by the authorities to make up for the 
bad publicity following the disaster, in which 1,221 people died and 
about 2,500 were injured.

The male co-worker told local 
journalists that she had in fact escaped from the eight-storey Rana 
Plaza building in Savar, Dhaka, on the day it came down, scrambling from
 the rubble alongside him.

The man told local journalists: ‘We escaped 
together. We both walked away from the rubble. We spent two days in 
hospital but then she vanished. The next time I saw her was on TV 17 
days later. They said it was a miracle, but it was a fake.’

Reshma and her family's lives have been transformed since the accident. She now has a lucrative job at a luxury hotel

Miss Begum told local television – in 
an interview beamed around the world – how she had managed to survive 
those long days by eating leftover food she found in fellow workers’ 
lunch boxes and drinking water dribbling from a broken pipe.

It was reported at the time that she 
had been trapped under a concrete slab but stayed alive thanks to an air
 pocket left by a Muslim prayer room in the basement.

She was photographed being carried on a
 stretcher from the ruins of the building on May 10, her face and 
clothes covered in white dust.

But Miss Begum’s landlady told 
journalists from Dhaka’s pro-opposition newspaper Amar Desh she had 
escaped from the building on the same day it had collapsed and had 
received treatment at the nearby Enam hospital.

It is now being claimed that in order 
to cover up the hoax, people living near the factory were curiously 
forced to move out of their homes the day before the young woman’s 
‘rescue’. They were allowed back once she was ‘saved’.

To add to the mystery, police imposed a 24-hour ban on filming of the continuing rescue operation.

Investigative journalists have also 
questioned Miss Begum’s apparently ‘good condition’ for someone who had 
supposedly spent 17 days trapped in the ruins of a building.

‘She said she had to claw her way 
through bricks and debris to reach water in dead victims’ rucksacks but 
her hands and fingernails did not show the marks you would expect,’ said
 Shishir Abdullah, a local journalist.

Investigators claim Miss Begum's appearance and injuries in the famous pictures are not consistent with 17 days trapped under rubble

Collapse: The building housed factories that made low-cost garments for Western brands. Authorities vowed to clamp down on unsafe working practices in the wake of the disaster

‘Also, her eyes were wide open when 
they pulled her out and she did not appear to be sensitive to the bright
 sunlight. Her sari was not ripped or torn and appeared clean.

‘People were suspicious but the 
government made a huge fuss of hailing it as a miracle. People were 
taken in. Everyone was fooled.’

Miss Begum, who has since been 
‘awarded’ with a £600-a-month job at a luxury hotel in Dhaka, hit back 
angrily at the accusations.

‘Where I was, you were not there, so you have no idea,’ she said.

Her mother, Jobeda, who says she is 
thankful that because of her daughter’s courage the family have a new 
life, insisted: ‘Her escape is the miracle everyone thinks it is.’

The Bangladesh army, which led the search, rescue and body-recovery operation, has yet to respond to claims of a hoax.

When the Rana Plaza factory building crashed down in April, 1,129 people were killed.

Many of those freed are still recovering.Rescuers with no medical training were forced to perform amputations on the spot to free them without anaesthetic.

Bangladesh's government and garment manufacturers are campaigning to close dangerous factories and to make safety a priority for the country's most valuable export industry.

Bangladeshi garment factories are routinely built without consulting engineers.

Many are located in commercial or residential buildings not designed to withstand the stress of heavy manufacturing.

Some add illegal extra floors atop support columns too weak to hold them, according to a survey of scores of factories by an engineering university that was shown to The Associated Press.

A separate inspection, by the garment industry, of 200 risky factories found that 10 per cent of them were so dangerous that they were ordered to shut.

The textiles minister said a third inspection, conducted by the government, could show that as many as 300 factories were unsafe.
