A Florida supermarket manager fed up with shoplifters single handedly took down one unsuspecting offender right as TV news cameras were rolling.

Lenin Ubiera-Cruz saw a man he recognized as a thief from his Orlando, Florida store’s security tapes, just as he was complaining to a local news crew about a recent rash of store thefts.

And it wasn’t the first time the dedicated employee took matters into his own hands.

Nabbed: Lenin Ubiera-Cruz was giving an interview about rampant shoplifting when he suddenly chased and restrained a thief he recognized

‘Just give me one second,’ Ubiera-Cruz told WFTV reporter Kenneth Craig during a recent interview about rampant shoplifting in recent days at the Family Foods Supermarket Ubiera-Cruz manages.

As he described the four thefts he knew of just in the previous two days, Ubiera-Cruz saw a man he recognized.

‘This is the guy that stole the other day,’ he told Craig as he took off in a sprint.

With cameramen following, Ubiera-Cruz confronted Lawrence Ratcliff, who he says tapes showed stealing meat and stuffing a carton of eggs down his pants.

Thwomp! The valiant store manager chased down a man he says shoved a carton of eggs down his pants and thrust him off his feet single handedly

‘You going on the floor,’ commanded Ubiera-Cruz as he dramatically knocked Ratcliff off his feet.

As Ratcliff protested, Ubiera-Cruz put him in a choke hold and laughed into the camera, saying ‘That’s what I do to the other one.’

The manhandling manager had done the very thing before.

Twice.

Once, video showed Ubiera-Cruz pulling a suspected shoplifter across the store in a full nelson.

And during another previous encounter, an accused thief was caught on camera punching an employee as he left. Ubierra-Cruz chased the man down and the man pulled a knife and cut him.

The wound was a light one, though, and the man was soon arrested.

'No matter what,' Ubiera-Cruz said, 'we want to catch them, no matter what.'

As for his most recent home grown heroics, the WFTV reporter looked on in awe as Ubiera-Cruz continued to restrain the suspect on the ground.

‘I got you, I got you, I got you camera,’ he told the struggling Ratcliff.

A crowd gathered around the commotion, but Ubiera-Cruz didn’t need the help.

Eventually, police arrive to take the man to jail, where he would spend five days for shoplifting. He was also fined $273.

Ubiera-Cruz, meanwhile, lives to defend his store another day.

Hauled off: Police eventually showed up and hauled the suspect away. He served five days and paid a fine for shoplifting
