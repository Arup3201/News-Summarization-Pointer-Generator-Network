Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge have paid tribute to the charity set up in their mother's name and revealed that she would have been 'proud' of its achievements.

The Diana Award, which aims to tackle bullying and social exclusion, was set up two years after the late princess' death in 1999.

Now her sons have spoken out about their mother's charitable legacy, wishing the Diana Award a Happy 15th Birthday and praising its 'energy and passion'.

Proud: The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry said their mother would have been 'proud' of the Diana Award

Writing in a joint foreword for a book celebrating the organisation's decade and a half, the two continued: 

'We believe, when encouraged and supported, that young people have the ability to change society for the better.

'We know that our mother - in whose memory this award was established - felt the same and would be proud of its achievements to date.'

Along with working to tackle problems such as bullying and social exclusion, the Diana Award also runs training, mentoring and anti-bullying ambassador programmes.

Its awards are presented to young people, including volunteers, carers and fund-raisers, who have a monumental impact on the lives of others.

'Having met young people working with the charity in Newcastle and in London, we were struck in both cases by their deep and lasting sense of social responsibility,' added the princes.

'These young people were working hard to tackle the social issues that affected them - such as bullying or social exclusion - and the Diana Award empowered them to do more.'

Among those being handed Diana Awards  at a reception at 11 Downing Street today were Ellie Louise Harris-Beard, 13, and Kyle Lewis, 18.

Miss Harris-Beard, from Kidderminster, was handed the Diana Champion Fundraiser Award for helping to set up the charity Cords4Life to encourage umbilical cord donation.

Her brother Charlie was treated using stem cells from an umbilical cord in 2011, although he tragically lost his fight against leukaemia last year.

'I was quite shocked,' said the schoolgirl of the moment she heard that she was to be given the award. 'I didn’t know what to say. It’s exciting.'

Miss Harris-Beard, who has raised £25,000 for charity so far and was handed her award by JLS star, Oritse Williams, said she now plans to organise a fundraising ball.

Encouraging others to take up fundraising, she advised people to 'just go and do it and do the best you can.'

Her mother Fiona Harris-Beard said: 'Considering what we’ve been through, losing Charlie, I’m so proud of her. She’s so determined.'

Fellow award winner, Kyle Phillips, 18, from Cardiff, got his Diana Champion Volunteer Award for his tireless volunteering.

Along with a part time role at a greengrocer, Mr Phillips volunteers for more than 500 hours a year at school and leads a group to improve the literacy and numeracy of young boys - many of whom have behavioural or learning difficulties.

'It’s a great honour,' he said after receiving his award. 'It’s a real privilege to be recognised. I’m really just trying to help the youth in my community. 

Inspiring: William and Harry say they have been inspired by the Diana Awards volunteers they have met

'Where I’m from, people think that it’s very stereotypical being a teenager - gangs and smoking - but I want to show them it’s not like that.

'I get up at six o’clock every morning and go to work and finish at 8.30 and make my way over to the school. My mum’s really proud of me. She loves what I do and how I help out others.'

His mother Jane Phillips added: 'It’s not every day you get the opportunity to go to Downing Street. I’m extremely proud.'

Prime Minister David Cameron, who is patron of the Diana Award, added his voice to the chorus of royal praise for the charity.

'I am honoured to be a Patron of this wonderful living legacy to the late princess which recognises young people for their contributions to society,' he said in a statement.

'I want to congratulate everyone involved on this special 15th anniversary and I look forward to seeing thousands more young people recognised and inspired in the years and decades ahead.'
