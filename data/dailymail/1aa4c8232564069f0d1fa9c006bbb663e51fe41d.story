A worrying study has revealed that annual total of gun deaths in the United States is catching up with the number who are killed in car crashes.

The report published in the Annual Review of Public Health compares a number of figures, including traffic deaths as well as suicides and homicides involving a firearm.

The total of those killed in a vehicle is still higher than those who die by a gun shot, but the gap between the figures is narrowing substantially and in 13 states it has already been overtaken.

In California, Arizona, Montana, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia and Colorado, the number of deaths by guns is higher than those killed by a car.

A graph published in the Annual Review of Public Health reveals that gun deaths in the United States are getting gradually closer to those killed in car crashes 

States on the west coast generally had a larger number of deaths resulting from gun violence or suicide than the total killed while in a vehicle 

The study also highlights that there are far more firearm suicides than homicides 

However in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Nevada and Utah, gun suicides alone exceed the total in traffic deaths. 

According to the study titled The Epidemiology of Firearm Violence in the Twenty-First Century United States, these deaths cost the economy approximately $164.6 billion in 2010, around 1.1 per cent of the US GDP for that year. 

The suicide rate in Montana was 8.5 times that in New Jersey while the homicide rate in Louisiana was 9.5 times that in New Hampshire. However states with high rates of firearm homicide did not necessarily have had high rates of firearm suicide.

Instead, states with both the highest and lowest rates of firearm suicide were among those with low rates of firearm homicide. 

Low-suicide, low-homicide states tended to be in New England whereas high-suicide, low-homicide states tended to lie in the rural Northwest.  

This graph highlights the correlation between suicides and homicides for every state. For example The suicide rate in Montana was 8.5 times that in New Jersey while the homicide rate in Louisiana was 9.5 times that in New Hampshire

States with both high-suicide and high-homicide rates were generally in the Southeast.

Firearms were used in 69.6 per cent of all homicides that year (74.2 per cent among men and 52.4 per cent among women) and 50.9 per cent of all suicides (56.4 per cent among men and 31.2 per cent among women, for whom firearms ranked second after poisoning).

The findings are also broken down into demographics, highlighting a wide variation of those involved.

For example suicides are the cause of far more deaths than homicides. The figures peak for victims in their mid-twenties and gradually increase with age.

Homicides on the other hand are more likely to kill people in their late teens and early twenties with the numbers going down with age.

These figures show that gun-related homicides are more likely to involve people in their late teens and early twenties while decreasing with age, whereas firearm suicides increase gradually from a high point of people in their mid-twenties 

Black males were revealed as the demographic most likely to be involved in a firearm-related homicide 

The trend was the same when it came to women. However the scale is much smaller with just over seven deaths per 100,000 due to gun homicide whereas in men it is around 90 for every 100,000 

Young black men are the demographic with the highest rate of gun-related homicides while older white males have the highest rate when it comes to killing themselves with a gun. There is a similar trend for women. 

Firearm homicide death rates peak among black men and women ages 20 to 24.However there is a vast difference in the scale. 

Among black males that age, the rate is nearly 90 deaths per 100,000 people, while for black females, the rate is closer to seven deaths per 100,000.

The author Garen J. Wintemute concludes that, despite the shocking figures, the trend of gun deaths has remained stable for the past decade. Homicides are decreasing but suicides are on the up. 

In 2012, 64 per cent  

The summary reads: 'Further research on the nature and prevention of firearm violence is sorely needed. Fortunately President Obama has directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to resume its work in the field.

'Evidence-based interventions may lead to substantial reductions in death and disability from this important public health problem.'

This shows that white men are more likely to be involved in a firearm suicide and the number of deaths increases with age 

White females are also more likely to kill themselves using a gun, however the total peaks with women in their late-40s to early-50s and then declines 

This bar chart reveals that the United States is far ahead of other countries in the world when it comes to gun-related deaths, whether that is suicide or homicide. In comparison, the country has low levels of violence as a result of assault
