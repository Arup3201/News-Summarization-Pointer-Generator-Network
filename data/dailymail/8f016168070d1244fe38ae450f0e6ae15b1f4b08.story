One of the favourites in Brazil's annual Miss BumBum competition has hit back at accusations of committing electoral fraud.

Livia Santos was disqualified from the competition, which took place on Monday, for allegedly hacking the voting process.

Ms Santos, a finalist and firm favourite, claims she did not hack the system – but simply had her husband hire people to vote for her.

Ms Santos is now threatening to sue the organiser of Miss BumBum, as she claims they were aware that she had 'employees who have been voting for me for two months'.

'She bought votes and I do not agree with that,' Miss BumBum organiser Cacau Oliver said according to International Business Times.

Ms Santos then claimed she had been approached by Miss BumBum judges who had offered to help her win in exchange for money.

This follows similar accusations made during last year's Miss BumBum competition, when two contestants were accused of paying thousands of pounds to the event's judging panel to come first and second.

Brazil's O Dia newspaper reported that Eliana Amaral, a law student representing the northeastern state of Pernambuco, had allegedly paid organisers around £18,000 for second place.

The Miss BumBum contest begins with 27 candidates chosen to represent each of Brazil's 26 states and the federal district Brasilia.

The women are then whittled down to a final 15 in an online round, before a winner is chosen by a judging panel of six women and five men.

This year's winner, Indianara Carvalho from Santa Catarina state, received around £1,500 in prize money and £20,000 in modelling contracts - but but is also set to earn hundreds of thousands in appearances and endorsements.

Second place has also become a coveted position after previous years' runners up have achieve greater fame than the actual winners.
