This is the terrifying moment a computer shop was ram-raided by thieves in a stolen Vauxhall Vectra which had been snatched in a knife-point car-jacking.

The gang reversed the stolen car into the roller shutters - causing thousands of pounds worth of damage - before plundering expensive electrical equipment inside.

The black estate car had been taken two days before the raid in Rochdale, Lancashire, during a car-jacking in a Morrisons car park.

Before: Police have released footage showing the moment this computer shop in Rochdale, Lancashire was ram-raided by thieves in a stolen Vauxhall Vectra which had been snatched in a knife-point car-jacking.

Impact: The CCTV camera inside the shop shakes violently as the front door is hit in the ram-raid

Broken: Just a few seconds later the damage from the impact of the car can clearly be seen

Entry: A figure can then be seen crawling under the broken roller door

Police have released footage of the gang during the break-in at the CEX store today, showing the car reverse into the shop twice, before one of the raiders clambered into the broken store front and stole several computer consoles and other electrical items.

Another suspect, seen wearing a two-tone zip up hooded Adidas jacket with dark pants and dark footwear, held back the roller shutters while the burglary at around 12.45am on February 12 took place. The other two wore dark clothing. All three were white.

On February 10, at around 5.30pm, a 51-year-old was returning to her car, which had been left in the supermarket car park in Rochdale, when she saw a man running towards her car before producing a large knife. 

Access: One person can be seen holding up the roller door as another raider creeps inside

Help: A suspect, seen wearing a two-tone zip up hooded Adidas jacket with dark pants and dark footwear, holds up the roller shutters

Plunder: One of the raiders had clambered into the broken store front and stole several computer consoles and other electrical items

He demanded that she hand over the keys, before driving off in her car.

Police believe the vehicle was later stored behind Premier Stores in Rochdale.

The offender in this case was white, approximately 5ft 5ins tall with a stocky build, wearing a full black balaclava with the eyes cut out and all black clothing.

The car was later found abandoned.

Stash: The hooded raider removes expensive electrical equipment from the shop

Linked: The black estate car used in the raid had been taken two days during a car-jacking in a Morrisons car park

'Thankfully the woman wasnâ€™t hurt in the carjacking but she has been left really upset,' said  Detective Constable Amanda McPartland.

'It happened at a busy supermarket at one of the busiest times of the day so, if you were there at the time and we haven't spoken to you yet, then please come forward.

'This car was then used in the ram-raid which caused a huge amount of damage with massive financial implications for the business.

'We have issued these images in the hope that, if youâ€™ve seen this car, then we really need to speak to you.'
