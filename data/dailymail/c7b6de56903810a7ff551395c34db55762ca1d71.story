These dramatic photographs have captured ice-cold waves crashing against rocks off the coast of Italy.

The pictures show the waves precisely at their breaking point displaying what appears to be a crystal-like blanket of water. 

The images were taken by Italian photographer Giovanni Allievi, 44, who was on a trip to Savona, in northern Italy.

'Where I live the sea is a peaceful presence, but in certain seasons it can show its power,' said  Mr Allievi. 

'To me, humans seem like dwarfs in comparison to the power of nature.

'During sea storms it is possible to see this spectacular phenomenon where the waves can take up amazing shapes. 

'There
 is a place a few kilometres from where I live in which the sea bed 
rises abruptly and ends with a vertical cliff, it is an amazing sight to
 witness.'

Mr Allievi, from Varigotti, in Italy, says he sets off early in the morning to capture the waves in all their glory. 

With the sun rising in the background behind the waves, he captured the stunning aqua colours as the water breaks.

Mr Allievi said: 'It takes a long time to capture these photographs.

'I guess you could say the perfect shot can take a lifetime, but you must possess patience and perseverance for the most part.

'Generally, people tend to be lazy and don't wake up to see the early morning waves when they're at their best.

'Because of this, I find people are fascinated by my photographs, seeing them as something very exotic.

'Some have even thought they were paintings.

'One
 of my favourite quotes is from French novelist Marcel Proust, where he 
said "the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new 
landscapes, but in having new eyes.'
