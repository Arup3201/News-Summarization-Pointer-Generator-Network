Vince Cable was dismissed as 'ridiculous' today as he caved in to pressure from Nick Clegg to back the Lib Dem leader in a crunch vote on the economy.

The Business Secretary had vowed to stay away from the showdown at the party conference in Glasgow, in a move seen as a challenge to Mr Clegg’s authority.

Publicly Mr Clegg played down talk of a rift, but privately his allies were furious at what they saw as botched attempt by Mr Cable to woo left-wing Lib Dems unhappy with the austerity programme.

Mr Clegg saw off the challenge to his authority as rebel amendments were overwhelmingly defeated at the party's annual conference in Glasgow.

Left-wing Lib Dems wanted to commit the party to watering down the Government's deficit-reduction programme and changing the mandate of the Bank of England to encourage growth and job creation.

Mr Cable - who had not been planning to vote - made an 
11th-hour change of heart and turned up in the conference hall to cast 
his vote in support of Mr Clegg.

An ally of the Lib Dem leader said: 'Vince now just looks f****** ridiculous. The self-indulgent act of subordination can only be done so many times.'

Appeal: In an unusual move Mr Clegg spoke in the debate to persuade members to back his economic policy

Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael today admitted he is 'fine' with the idea of Nick Clegg being deeply unpopular.

Almost three-quarters of people identifying themselves as Lib Dem voters in a survey by OnePoll for Daybreak said Mr Clegg was not a good leader.

More than half said he should stand down before the 2015 election.

But Mr Carmichael said: 'There are going to be people who don’t like us because they are Conservatives and they want the Government to be more Conservative or because they’re Labour supporters and they want it to go in the opposite direction.

'The fact of the matter is that Liberal Democrats in government every day are making a real difference. And if that makes Nick unpopular with Conservatives and Labour voters, then frankly that’s alright by me.'

It was seen as an embarrassing about-face which will have damaged Mr Cable's leadership ambitions.

The row dates from when the economic motion was agreed at an away day where MPs backed Mr Clegg's tough line.

Today Mr Cable sat in the middle of the conference hall as Mr Clegg gave an impassioned speech urging members to back his policy.

He warned delegates that victory for 
the amendments would be welcomed only by Chancellor George Osborne and 
his Labour shadow Ed Balls.

Mr Clegg said: 'Please be careful for what you wish for. If we start messing about with the big goalposts we have stuck in the ground which frame the stability which is required for further economic growth, we will destroy jobs and decrease prosperity.'

Mr Cable last night signalled that he would not back a motion supporting the Coalition’s deficit reduction plans.

Mr Cable issued a statement saying there were ‘aspects’ of the motion he could not support.

This was seen as a clear signal that he wants the Government to increase borrowing.

It
was seen as a direct challenge to Mr Clegg, who has made a bold pitch 
that the economic recovery would not be happening without Lib Dems in 
government.

‘Loyalty isn’t really Vince’s thing,’ said a senior party source.

This morning Mr Clegg said: ‘I don't run a boot camp, I don't determine exactly who is in which room at what time.’

Home Office minister Jeremy Browne also took a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Cable’s tendency to try to appear ‘bashful’ about being part of the coalition.

Speaking at a Policy Exchange fringe event, Mr Browne did not mention Mr Cable by name.

But
he warned: ‘The task for us as a party is to ask ourselves are we proud
of our government or are we ashamed of it? We need to sell the purpose 
of the government rather than feeling bashful about it.

‘We shouldn’t equivocate when it comes to the role we have played in the gradual national recovery.

‘If we don’t associate ourselves with those achievements, we don’t deserve to be associated with the recovery by anybody else.'

Senior Lib Dem source

In a highly unusual move, Mr Clegg took  to the platform himself to urge his party to stick to the 
spending plans agreed with the Tories.

He saw off the challenge from left-wing activists who tabled a rebel
amendment which called for borrowing restrictions on councils to be 
lifted, allowing town hall chiefs to run up deficits to pay for new 
housing.

Lib Dem President Tim Farron, another potential leadership challenger seen as a standard-bearer for the left, gave his fulsome support to Mr Clegg.

Warning against handing over credit for the recovery to George Osborne, Mr Farron told the conference: 'What an irony: just as the economy was growing, just as our 2010 decisions were being vindicated, just as our fortunes were turning, we got the jitters and handed the credit to George Osborne.

'What an irony if just at the moment that even as Ed Balls isn't sure that he agrees with Ed Balls ... we might agree with Ed Balls.'

He urged his party to have the courage to vote in favour of the motion.
