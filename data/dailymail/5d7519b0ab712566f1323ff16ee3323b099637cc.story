Savannah Guthrie has taken over Brian Williams' spot on NBC Nightly News as Lester Holt deals with a family emergency.

The 43-year-old Today host has filled in a number of times in the past when Williams was ill or on vacation.

Guthrie was among the few tipped to take over permanently from disgraced Williams when he was suspended for allegedly fabricating anecdotes about the Iraq war.

However Guthrie, a former attorney who joined NBC as a legal analyst in 2007, cannot accept the spot as she is contracted to present Today until 2018.

According to Deadline, Hoda Kotb will temporarily take Guthrie's spot as producers grapple to find a solution to boost their viewer ratings that are trailing ABC's Good Morning America.

Guthrie's time in the anchor chair was unlikely to be permanent as Holt has been having no trouble reining in the audiences.

Viewer ratings shot up by more than half a million viewers on his second week filling in for suspended Williams.

NBC's newscast averaged 10.1 million viewers in the second week of February, roughly 600,000 more than the week before, the Nielsen company said.

Holt, 55, has been with NBC News since 2000 and before that worked as a news anchor in Chicago for 14 years.

Besides being Williams' chief sub for the past two years, he co-anchors Dateline NBC, Weekend Today and Nightly News on the weekends.

He's been placed in a uniquely awkward position, asked to right the ship for a company desperate to get out of the headlines, not knowing whether it's a temporary position or one that could become permanent.

'It's tough,' said veteran news executive Rick Kaplan, once Holt's boss when he was MSNBC president. 

'He has to be very careful, because until Brian's future is outlined very clearly, Lester is just doing the network a favor in a way.'

He called Holt a wise choice for the role. Holt has unassailable credentials, works hard and does the job without drawing attention to himself, Kaplan said.

'What NBC needs is quiet competence, and Lester has that in abundance,' Kaplan said. 

'Lester is someone everybody can be proud of. He is somebody the people of NBC News can be proud of and rally behind, because that's what they need right now.'

Holt is choosing to keep his head down and do the job, not speaking publicly about his role. 

He's an accomplished bass guitar player, but he's not going on entertainment programs to show his chops or swap stories about the news business. 

Williams could lose his job if bosses decide he has brought himself into disrepute after it emerged he falsely claimed he was in a helicopter that came under fire while in Iraq.

An investigation has been launched into his reporting, especially the Iraq incident, which he said happened while covering the war in 2003.

The probe is also looking into his reports about seeing a body floating by during Hurricane Katrina and his presence at the fall of the Berlin wall.

Williams (pictured arriving for Letterman's show in 2013) is being investigated by NBC News

Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s

In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies.

In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up.

A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'.

Berlin Wall, 1989  

Tom Brokaw was historically the only American anchor present at the fall of the Berlin Wall. 

But during a 2008 forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Williams claimed he was at the Brandenburg gate 'the night the wall came down.' 

And although in a 2004 interview Williams said he arrived at the wall 'a day after -- more like 12 hours after -- Tom Brokaw did,' at a gala in 2014 he stated: '25 years ago tonight Tom Brokaw and I were at the Berlin Wall'.   

Iraq War, 2003

Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003.

Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present.

Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.'

Hurricane Katrina, 2005

Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans.

He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded.

The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster.

Israel, 2006

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel.

In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'.

Boston, 2006

A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live.

On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update. 

The 55-year-old faces the possibility of being fired because of a 'morality clause' in his contract that says his role can be terminated if he brings himself into disrepute.

Williams, who has been the nightly news anchor for 10 years, had recently signed a $10 million, five-year pact, Page Six reported.

The defining clause in his contract said: 'If artist commits any act or becomes involved in any situation, or occurrence, which brings artist into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which justifiably shocks, insults or offends a significant portion of the community, or if publicity is given to any such conduct . . . company shall have the right to terminate.'

Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken Williams' place.

The show has seen a significant drop in viewers since Williams was taken off air.

In a statement, NBC chief executive Stephen Burke wrote: 'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate.'

His claims came to light after a show was broadcast, featuring Williams describing how in 2003 he had survived his helicopter being shot down by a rocket propelled grenade.

His account was challenged by people who were in the actual craft that was hit and it emerged the NBC anchor was in fact in another helicopter entirely, around an hour behind the targeted helicopter.
