Anjelica Huston ended her relationship with actor Ryan O'Neal after the actor viciously attacked her at a Hollywood party, the Oscar-winner has claimed in a new memoir.

The Addams Family star, 63, and O'Neal, 73, a trained amateur boxer, were together in the 1970s.

In her new tell-all Watch Me - the second installment to her 2013 book, A Story Lately Told - Huston writes the Peyton Place star headbutted her during a soiree at a Beverly Hills mansion.

'He turned on me, grabbed me by the hair and hit me in the forehead with the top of his skull,' Huston alleges in the tome, an early copy of which was obtained by The National Enquirer.

'I saw stars and reeled back. Half blind I ran away from him.'

Huston said she had been walking back to the dining room of the house after going to the bathroom when she stopped in a hallway so as not to interrupt the performance of a belly dancer.

She claimed this agitated O'Neal, who ran outside where the alleged attack occurred.

Huston said she then went back to the bathroom to collect herself and was looked after by some security guards.

Kevin O'Neal, the actor;s brother, who had witnessed the assault, also comforted her, she says in the book.

Eventually Huston agreed to allow O'Neal into the bathroom to talk to her alone, however he allegedly turned on her again.

'Ryan was batting me about the head with an open hand,' the book says, according to The Enquirer.

'Then abruptly he left.'

Huston broke up with O'Neal as a result.

O'Neal's agent and publicist did not return requests for comment from The MailOnline. 

The alleged attack saw Huston retreat into the arms of her longtime on-off love, Jack Nicholson.

Kindred: Huston said she fell instantly in love with Nicholson, but could not handle his womanizing ways

She had left Nicholson in order to take up with O'Neal.

Huston and Nicholson were together, intermittently, between 1973 to 1989.

However she reveals in Watch Me that the constant adoration Nicholson received from female fans - and the way he responded to them - became too much for her.

When she confronted him about a sexual encounter he had with a former lover, Nicholson shut her down.

'Oh toots, it was just a mercy f---,' Nicholson is said to have responded.

Huston also writes of a drug arrest for cocaine possession.

The incident occurred at Nicholson's house.

Detectives had arrived at the scene to arrest director Roman Polanski, who had been dating a 13-year-old girl.

The officers began searching Huston.

'They started to go through my handbag, where they found a gram of cocaine,' she wrote.

'Roman and I were bundled into the back of two separate police cars.

'We were under arrest.'

After finally ending her relationship with Nicholson, Huston went on to marry sculptor Robert Graham in 1992.

The two were together until Graham's death in 2008.

They did not have any children.
