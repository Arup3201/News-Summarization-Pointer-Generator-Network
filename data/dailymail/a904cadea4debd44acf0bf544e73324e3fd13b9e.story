The father of a teenager killed when a minibus taking her to a hen party crashed has spoken for the first time about the tragedy - and his wife's feelings of guilt.

Bethany Jones, 18, died in April last year while travelling to a hen party with 20 others, including her mother Diane and sister Amy.

In an interview with the Daily Mirror Paul Jones, 52, said his wife struggles with guilt, suffers from flashbacks and often wakes up crying in the night following the loss of their youngest daughter.

Trainee nurse Miss Jones died after suffering multiple injuries and all of the other passengers on the coach, who were from the Pontefract area, were injured - some severely. 

Mr Jones said his wife Diane, 50, who suffered pelvis and chest injuries, blames herself for not getting the group off the coach when she realised there may have been a problem with the vehicle - which was later found to have a badly burnt-out clutch.

Mrs Jones had told the party they should get off when they smelt smoke just minutes after setting off on their journey.

Mr Jones said that his wife's pleas had fallen on deaf ears and she now struggles with feelings of guilt because she did not insist they get off the faulty bus.

He said: 'Clearly it wasn't her fault, but she'll have that for the rest of her life; "why didn't they get off the bus?"

The minibus (pictured top right) had slowed to just 5.5mph when a lorry ploughed into it on the M62 last year - firefighters who attended the crash said it was one of the worst they had ever seen

After smelling the smoke minibus driver James Johnson had stopped and inspected the vehicle but told the party it was safe to carry on with the journey.

But when the bus was on the motorway it slowed to just 5.5mph and a lorry drove into the back of it, flipping it over and injuring all of those on board - including Miss Jones.

Mr Jones said he rushed to the scene of the crash after receiving a phone call but was numbed by shock when he was told his daughter had been killed.

Mr Jones added: 'The only closure will be when I die. I will always be a broken man.' 

The minibus driver, James Johnson, has since admitted causing her death by dangerous driving.

The collision happened on April 26 last year after the 24-seater coach suffered mechanical problems and had come to a 'near standstill' on the motorway when it was hit by a lorry.

Lorry driver Kevin Ollerhead, 45, of Lincoln Crescent, St Helens, Merseyside, was cleared of causing Bethany's death following a trial last month.

Johnson, 64, of Whytecote End, Wyke, Bradford will be sentenced on November 14.
