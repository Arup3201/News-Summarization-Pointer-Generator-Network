West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says he is licking his lips at their festive fixture list despite the club having the 'hardest games' of their Premier League rivals.

The Hammers face consecutive London derbies in the space of two days as they host league leaders Chelsea before travelling to Arsenal.

Both opponents are in the top six, but Allardyce is looking forward to the challenge due to his side's form.

Saturday's 2-0 home win at Leicester means the Upton Park outfit have only lost one of their last 10 league matches as they sit fourth in the table.

'We're a completely different unit and we're enjoying our Christmas more this year. We do have the hardest games over 48 hours though,' said Allardyce at the club's pre-match press conference on Christmas Eve.

'I'm looking forward to the games on the basis of where we are in the league and what the team has done so far.'

Boxing Day's clash against Chelsea will see Allardyce pit his wits up against Blues' counterpart Jose Mourinho.

The duo traded a war of words after a 0-0 stalemate at Stamford Bridge last season, but Allardyce is looking for another good performance from his side with a result.

'It's great to pit your wits against the best and Jose is proving that again this season,' he added.

'A good account of ourselves is a result, not a good performance and a loss.'

Midfielder Mark Noble is available for West Ham once more after overcoming injury.

Noble has missed the last four games with an Achilles problem but has handed Allardyce a boost by returning to training in advance of the festive fixtures.

James Tomkins  is the only doubt for the Hammers due to a hamstring strain - with James Collins ready to step in alongside Winston Reid in the heart of their defence.
