Canadian police have charged a woman with human trafficking for allegedly blackmailing her roommate into prostitution.

Amanda Kathleen McGee, 31, offered an 18-year-old newly arrived in Calgary from her home in British Columbia cheap rent in her apartment.

It's alleged McGee then began slipping drugs into alcoholic drinks the pair were consuming, waiting until the young woman was unconscious then taking sexually explicit photos of her.

McGee then used the images to blackmail the 18-year-old into becoming a sex worker.

According to CBC News, the 18-year-old arrived in Calgary in October 2013 for a job and met McGee while looking for a place to live.

Concerned about her welfare, in January the woman's family asked local police to check on her.

Police located the young woman at a bus station on January 11, attempting to return home. She told officers that she had been held against her will and forced into prostitution by Amanda McGee, her roommate.

'I would suspect the family may have had information that she was attempting to travel back to her home residence,' acting staff sergeant Mike Saunders told the Calgary Herald.

'My understanding is she was trying to get away from the situation, return to family and friends.'

Police say McGee told the woman she would show the explicit photographs to her family and friends if she did not participate in sex acts for money.

McGee advertised the woman's services on social media, and clients would meet her at the home she shared with McGee.

The landlord of McGee, also her neighbor, said she didn't notice anything untoward occurring at the home.

"[I'm] totally surprised. We had no inkling at all that anything was going on over there," Sharon Lawton told CBC News.

Lawton said McGee told her that the 18-year-old was her young cousin.

McGee
 is also facing charges of extortion relating to a second victim. The 
female victim was allegedly a client of the 18-year-old girl and the 
pair were secretly filmed engaging in sex acts by McGee.

The 31-year-old then used that footage to blackmail the woman. Saunders did not elaborate on what McGee was forcing the victim to do.

Saunders said the second victim will not be charged for procuring a prostitute.

Amanda McGee is facing nine charges: trafficking in persons, administering a noxious substance to aggrieve or annoy, living on the avails of prostitution, keeping a common bawdy house, sexual assault with a weapon, forcible confinement, procuring a person to become a prostitute, extortion and voyeurism.

She is currently in custody and will appear in court Tuesday.

The victim is being supported by family and members of the vice unit.
