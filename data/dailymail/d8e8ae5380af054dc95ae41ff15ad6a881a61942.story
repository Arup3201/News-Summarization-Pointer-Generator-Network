In what could be described as one of the most creative and original proposals ever, a man has popped the question to his girlfriend of four and a half years, through Scoopon.

Sydney's Steve Brisson wanted to take the next step with his girlfriend Sayaka Shoji but didn't want to do it any old way, coming up with a crazy and elaborate plan, he knew she would love.

So Steve decided to give Sayaka, who was hooked on Scoopon, a website which offers great discounts, a deal she couldn't refuse.

Steve(right) and Sayaka(left) have been dating for four and a half years and Steve wanted to take the next step by proposing, but in a very different way

'I was looking at Sayaka on the couch, and she was checking Scoopon, Scoopon is like her second relationship, she loves it,' Steve told News.com.au.

'We cannot go anywhere without checking on Scoopon, we go to restaurants based on what deals she’s got on Scoopon. And I thought, that’s what I’ll do. I’ll use Scoopon.'

The next step was setting up the interesting plan and the 33 year old decided to document it all from start to finish. 

In a youtube video he is first seen getting ready for the big night ahead, 'much to do to get ready for the big night,' he said.

Steve had many plans to organise for the top secret mission, including picking a restaurant, an Indian restaurant was the one, and calling Scoopon to see if they would help him put up a 'Spend your whole life with a guy who is crazy about you' deal. Of course they agreed.

'First up, I styled the proposal like I was the deal, it was a lifetime opportunity, no exchange, things like that,' he told News.com.au.

Top secret mission : to explain the cameras at the restaurant he picked to propose he got the restaurant to write a fake notice

But The 33 year old Sydneysider went even further to make the moment, one of the most memorable for his girlfriend, he even got the restaurant to write a notice explaining why there would be a number of cameras there, when they dined.

It read that the restaurant had been chosen as one of the top Indian restaurants in Sydney and they would be featured in a media story.

It then said they were looking for local patrons, who knew loved their food, to come in and have dinner while they were shooting in the restaurant.

Nervous and excited about what was about to happen, the video then goes on to see Steve excuse himself to go to the bathroom, hoping Sayaka would then check Scoopon for a juicy deal.

She did of course, and was shocked in disbelief about what she was reading.

'Sayaka, the past four and a half years have been the best time in my life. I feel that I have found my best friend,' Steve said in the Scoopon article.

'You love me and challenge me in ways I never thought possible and as soon as we met I knew that you were someone special.'

'We have seen so much of the world together but I know there is so much more adventure ahead of us. So the next part of that adventure starts right now,' he said.

Then there was a big picture of Steve jumping into the air and the words 'Will you marry me'? 

Arriving back from the bathroom, Steve waited patiently for her to finish reading and then got down on bended knee and repeated the question, which she answered, YES.

Another quirky addition to the Sccopon deal, included a few details in fine print, because every deal has fine print.

It gave a list of things she may experience for the duration of the deal including, someone that doesn't washes the dishes as well as you do, someone who is obsessed with UFC and all sports as well as someone that can annoy you more than anyone else in the world.

The whole event, documented on camera, saw the couple embrace after the elaborate proposal, ready to start celebrating.

But the happy couple did keep the announcement under wraps for a little while longer.

'My mother’s not well, so we decided to surprise her at this event we were having for her on Saturday night,' Steve said. 

'It was ridiculous, she thought it was the coolest thing!'

Steve took to social media to spread his happiness about how well the plan went down and that Sayaka said yes.

'So, last week was kind of a big week. I can now let everyone know that after a TOP SECRET mission lasting months, that Sayaka and I are now engaged,' he posted on Facebook.

'We are absolutely thrilled and very excited. Big thanks to Scoopon Australia for making this such a great surprise.' 

The couple have not yet set a wedding date but here's wondering if it will be anything as elaborate as his proposal. Big shoes to fill.
