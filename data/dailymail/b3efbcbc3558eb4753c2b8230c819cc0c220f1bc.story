Sexting - the art of sending your partner a racy message - might not be a new phenomenon but it is becoming increasingly popular.

What's more, if a new survey is to be believed, it's no longer confined to teenagers with 38 per cent of British adults confessing to sending saucy text messages to their other halves.

Of those, 40 per cent come from London, making the capital the raciest place in the nations - on their phones at least.

Something to hide? 39 per cent of women and 26 per cent of men say they have peeked at a partner's phone

But while the capital's phones are buzzing with naughty messages, those living in Dorset, Devon, Somerset and Cornwall prefer a more direct approach and were the least likely to send a naughty missive.

The increasing popularity of sexting does have its pitfalls however, with 24 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men polled saying they suspect their partners of cheating on them.

As a result, 39 per cent of women and 26 per cent of men confess to regularly checking their partner's phones for extracurricular sext messages.

The results of the poll, which canvassed the views of 1,000 people in relationships, were released to coincide with the launch of Mad About You, a new novel by author Sinead Moriarty.

Billed as a ‘marriage thriller,’ Mad About You tells the story of Emma, who moves to London with her husband, James, and young children.

Things take a turn for the worse when a new nanny is employed and James begins to spend increasing amounts of time in the office.

While the arrival of the new nanny throws Emma's love life into disarray, there is some good news for those thinking of hiring an au pair.

Although sexting contributes to marital strife, according to researchers, 62 per cent of women and 73 per cent of men would have 
no trouble trusting their partner with a young and attractive 
nanny.

Like Vernon Kay, who famously incurred the wrath of wife Tess Daly after a sexting scandal in 2010, it seems it might be safer to step away from the phone.
