A boy whose fear of open spaces left him scared to leave his house is now venturing outside after striking up a heart-warming friendship with a dog.

Owen Howkins, seven, and his trusted companion Haatchi have become inseparable after the family pet helped him overcome anxiety.

Owen became 'withdrawn' at school when he realised a rare genetic condition made him different to other boys and girls.

Tragically, it left him scared to talk to people and worried about leaving his home in Basingstoke, Hampshire.

But now Haatchi - an Anatolian shepherd dog - has given Owen a new lease of life after dad Will Howkins adopted the pet from a rescue centre. The pair can be seen walking down the road together after becoming the best of friends.

Owen suffers from Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, which means his muscles are always tense.

Haatchi himself had a difficult start in life, suffering horrific injuries when he was tied to a railway line and hit by a train around ten months ago. He was found days later, cowering, with a mangled tail and back leg.

By the time he was taken to a vet's surgery, nothing could be done to save his leg and tail and both had to be amputated.

Haatchi's future looked bleak as the RSPCA and UK German Shepherd rescue centre struggled to find him new home.

But he was eventually adopted by father Will and fiancee Colleen Drummond, 41, who read about the animal's plight on Facebook.

Colleen, who has been part of the family since Owen was three, said: 'As soon as they met, the effect Haatchi had on Owen was incredible. Before his arrival, Owen didn't like going out.

'When he first started school, he became more aware of being different, and he became even more withdrawn.'

Owen's condition requires regular hospital treatment but the simple joy of being around the "energetic puppy" makes it easier for him to cope with.

Now he feels differently about his syndrome after seeing Haatchi take his "medicine" - a mix of manuka honey, salmon oil and supplements.

Colleen said: 'Owen used to be scared of strangers but he now wants to talk to everyone about Haatchi and wants to go out all the time to dog shows.

'The difference we see in him can't be put into words.'

Will, 33, an RAF engineer at RAF Odiham, said: 'Owen is incredibly attached to Haatchi - in fact, they are very attached to each other.

'Haatchi will come and drink out of the bath when I'm bathing Owen, and they don't like to be apart.'

Haatchi, aged 15 months, recently completed his training as a "Pets as Therapy" dog.

He will soon begin visiting soldier amputees injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as sick and terminally-ill children.

Haatchi's amazing survival and the positive impact he has had on Owen's life has resulted in him winning an award from the International Fund for Animal Welfare. It will be presented at the Animal Action Awards event at House of Lords next week.

The event will be hosted by Baroness Gale and awards presented by Queen guitarist Brian May.

Robbie Marsland, UK Director of IFAW, said: 'When we heard Haatchi's amazing story of survival and the very special relationship he has with Owen, we knew he had to be IFAW's Animal of the Year.'

Colleen said: 'We feel completely privileged and honoured that Haatchi is to receive this IFAW award.'
