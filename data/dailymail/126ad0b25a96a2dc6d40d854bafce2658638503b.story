The first weekend of the new Premier League season brings a sense of anticipation and excitement for football fans around the world. As the 2014-15 campaign gets underway, we look back at some memorable opening games from years gone by...

Arsenal 1-3 Aston Villa (2013)

As Arsene Wenger's side walked out on the pitch, it was evident that the team was nearly identical to the one that finished the last campaign. Villa recorded a 3-1 victory and, when the final whistle blew, the Emirates Stadium erupted into boos, protesting the lack of money  spent on improving the squad.

Wenger then splashed £42.5million to bring German international Mesut Ozil to north London from Real Madrid. 

Unrest: Arsenal fans were unhappy at the lack of money spent by manager Arsene Wenger

City 3-2 Southampton (2012)

One would have thought that Premier League champions would beat  newly promoted  Southampton quite comfortably. But it was not the case as Southampton put up a fight and gave City a run for their money, forcing the champions to come from 2-1 down and win 3-2 in dramatic fashion.

To the rescue: Edin Dzeko scored the equaliser as Manchester City fought back to beat Southampton

Wigan 0-4 Blackpool (2010)

Blackpool were clear underdogs for the 2010-11 season. They finished sixth in the Championship and won promotion via the play-offs. But they couldn't have gotten off to a better start as they thumped Wigan 4-0 in their opening Premier League game. It was the start of a fascinating campaign for Blackpool which ultimately resulted into relegation.

Shock: The surprise victory was the start of a fascinating Premier League season for Blackpool

Everton 1-6 Arsenal (2009)

It is rare to see an away team have it so easy at Goodison Park, especially in the opening game of the season. Historically, Arsenal have struggled at Everton, but this game was the perfect start Wenger's side were looking for.

Chelsea 1-0 Manchester United (2004)

Jose Mourinho's first league match was against the mighty Manchester United. The Portuguese manager arrived at Stamford Bridge with a big reputation and he was handed a tough start against Sir Alex Ferguson's side. Eidur Gudjohnsen's goal was enough for Chelsea to win three points, and it proved to be the start of a historic reign in which Mourinho guided the Blues to back-to-back Premier League titles.

Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea (2003)

All eyes were on Chelsea as their Russian revolution began in Liverpool. New owner Roman Abramovich had given Claudio Ranieri a huge transfer budget and the likes of Juan Sebastian Veron, Joe Cole, Hernan Crespo, Claude Makelele and Damien Duff all arrived in big-money deals.

Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink's winner silenced Anfield and fired a warning to the rest of the league that Chelsea meant business.

Leicester 0-5 Bolton (2001)

Bolton had just returned to the Premier League after a three-year spell in the Championship. Sam Allardyce's side were among the favourites for relegation, but they demolished Leicester in their own backyard. It was the beginning of an 11-year stay in the top flight of English football for the side from the North West. 

Statement: Bolton returned to the Premier League with an emphatic victory at Leicester

Aston Villa 3-1 Manchester United (1996)

This was United's first test with a whole new set of stars. Alex Ferguson received criticism for selling experienced players such as Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis and replacing them with new faces such as David Beckham, Paul Scholes, and Nicky Butt. 

Despite winning both the league and the FA Cup that season, United got off to a horrible start, losing 3-1 at Villa Park. This game resulted in Alan Hansen coming up with his famous quote on Match of the Day saying United will 'never win anything with kids'.

Sheffield United 2-1 Manchester United (1992)

The first ever Premier League game saw Sheffield United beat Manchester United 2-1. Brian Deane earned his place in the history books when he scored the first ever Premier League goal five minutes into the game. United went on to win the league, despite this opening day defeat, and begin an era of dominance in English football.

Nottingham Forest 1-0 Liverpool (1992)

The Sky Sports revolution began at the City Ground. In the first televised game on the new satellite channel, Teddy Sheringham scored the only goal as Forest beat Liverpool 1-0 in front of the Super Sunday cameras.

It marked the start of a new era in football broadcasting and the likes of Super Sunday and Monday Night Football became must-see matches for fans up and down the country.
