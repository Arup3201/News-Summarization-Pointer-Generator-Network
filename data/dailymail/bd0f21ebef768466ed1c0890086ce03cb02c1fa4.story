The former Mrs Russell Brand has been dressing up and giving her best pout in a new series of sultry stills for celebrity favourite hair-styling brand, ghd.

Shot by renowned fashion photographer Ellen von Unwerth in LA, the images reveal 27-year-old singer Katy Perry’s new look as ghd's Global Brand Ambassador.

Shimmer: Katy Perry is the Global Brand Ambassador for luxury hair-styling brand ghd.

Perry - who was paid £1.2m to perform at Holly Valance's nuptials last weekend - poses in a series of three classic monochrome images - entitled Shimmer, Megaphone and Hepburn - wearing three different wearable hair looks and simple, dark make-up.

Shimmer sees her sitting at a dressing table wearing a sparkling floor-length, backless dress, coyly turning around to peek at the camera from behind her long dark wavy locks.

In Megaphone the singer sits in a director's chair, preparing to give orders through a loud piece, wearing a low-cut white shirt, tied in the middle, and big hoop earrings.

And in Hepburn Perry looks at the camera through a mirror in a dressing room, her blow-dried hair falling about her face in large soft curls.

Megaphone: The glamorous new stills were shot by renowned fashion photographer Ellen von Unwerth in LA.

Perry has been a brand ambassador for ghd - which stands for 'good hair day' - since 2011, and has done three previous shoots for the brand, some of which involved her swinging from chandeliers.

The singer said: 'It was fun to go a more natural route after playing characters in my 
last ghd campaign. Ellen von Unwerth captured both the 
playful and chic looks amazingly well.'

Ghd's CEO Paul Stoneham said: 'Our new campaign brings the ghd brand promise of a "good hair day, every day" to life. Katy and Ellen have created something really special in these images, capturing the essence of ghd today.'

The new ghd air - the brand's 
first salon-strength professional hairdryer - was used to create all of 
Katy's looks.

Hepburn: The classic images see Perry sporting an array of covetable, wearable hair looks, and exuding confidence.
