A liquor entrepreneur affectionately known as 'Dr. Vodka' was killed in a high speed crash early Thursday morning on Florida's MacArthur Causeway.

Malcolm Lloyd was sitting in the passenger seat of a 2012 model Lamborghini traveling toward the mainland at more than 100 miles per hour when it slammed into an SUV parked at a red light.

Lloyd, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Old Nassau Imports, died at the scene.

Known as 'Dr. Vodka' for his advanced degrees and prowess in the liquor business, Malcolm Lloyd was killed in a car crash early Thursday

The driver of the car, Andres Esteban Toro, was hospitalized at Jackson Memorial Hospital where the Miami Herald reports he is in critical but stable condition. 

Toro is Lloyd's brother-in-law.

The Lamborghini, with a sticker price of roughly $400,000 according to Car and Driver, was completely destroyed.

Authorities say the car was traveling so fast it launched through the air 100 yards from the crash scene

The SUV's driver, Raul Alfonzo, is also in the Jackson Memorial Hospital and is also in stable condition.

A stretch of the MacArthur was shut down for more than 10 hours for cleanup after the accident, causing backups on the nearest connectors from Miami Beach to the mainland.

Toro was driving so fast the car was lifted into the air and propelled more than 100 yards from the crash site. 

Miami Beach police spokesman Bobby Hernandez said charges are pending.

Authorities said charges are currenty pending against the Lamborghini's driver Raul Alfonzo

Toro had a history of reckless driving, and in the past three years racked up five moving violations, including failure to stop at a light and disobeying a stop sign.

In each case, the charges were either dismissed or Toro pled no contest. 

The pair were reportedly returning from a night at Versace Mansion, the former home of designer Giannia Versace which was reopened as a luxury hotel and club last month.

Alfonzo's attorney, Glen Z. Goldberg, said his client is in 'really bad shape' and that he has no idea 'how he is alive.'

Driver Raul Alfonzo has a history of reckless driving with at least five moving violation charges in recent years

The crash so was horrific a section of the MacArthur Causeway had to be closed for 10 hours for cleanup

Before starting Old Nassau Imports in 2005 with his godfather, who spent more than 30 years in the liquor industry, Lloyd earned an engineering degree from John Hopkins and a medical degree from Dartmouth.

Lloyd, 42, has been featured in numerous lifestyle magazines in New York City, where he made his home.

In 2011 he credited an 'incredible master distiller' he from the Terra Mountains of Slovakia for the success of his imported, mid-price vodka.

He was honored by Goldman Sachs in 2012 as one of the top 100 innovative entrepreneurs in the country. 

Malcolm Lloyd and driver Raul Alfonzo were headed home from a night at the Versace mansion, which is now an exclusive club and hotel
