Passengers have reported 'chaos and mass delays' at Bristol Airport after a power failure in the terminal.

Flights have been grounded and some passengers were reported to have been told to wait outside the terminal building.

The airport said it had engineers on site attempting to fix the problem, and that some power to the building had been restored.
