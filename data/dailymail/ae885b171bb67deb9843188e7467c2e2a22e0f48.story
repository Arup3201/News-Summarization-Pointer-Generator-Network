Good Morning America newsman Josh Elliott has reportedly been forced to attend a showdown with ABC top brass over his continuing diva-like on-set behavior.

Elliot is understood to have received a serious dressing down from senior executives who are growing tired of the friction he is creating behind the scenes on the show.

Negative stories about Elliott leak from the GMA set on an alarmingly regular basis and bosses have been forced to act due to a growing number of complaints from members of the team.

Diva-like behavior: Good Morning America co-anchor Josh Elliott has reportedly been forced to attend a showdown with ABC top brass over his on-set behavior

'He’s being gossiped about in the media, and Josh is lashing out in a passive-aggressive way,' an insider told the New York Post. 'They’re concerned about his behavior and trying to come up with a game plan. He’s a popular anchor, and they want to stop the gossip and focus on developing his talent.'

GMA insiders describe Elliott as the most high maintenance of the show’s anchors, someone who regularly ‘lashes out’ at writers when he doesn’t like scripts and who has 'serious trust issues with women stemming from a difficult childhood.'

GMA producer Tom Cibrowski issued a denial several months ago, going as far as describing Elliott as ‘the ultimate team player’ - but the allegations have kept coming. A Good Morning America spokesperson described the allegations about Elliott as 'absolutely false' and described the meeting as a 'very productive' discussion about other potential projects for Josh and additional support for him.

Elliott has also been in the news over his relationship with WABC-TV anchor Liz Cho, although that has apparently cooled due to his 'trust issues' and flirtations with other women.

Reports surfaced earlier this month that Elliott had regularly been spotted doing the 'walk of shame' from Cho’s apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.

A source told RadarOnline: 'Josh Elliott, right. has been seen sneaking out of local anchor Liz Cho's apartment way early in the morning. '

The couple were first reported to be in a relationship in September and a source told RadarOnline today: 'Josh has been seen sneaking out of Liz's apartment way early in the morning.

'It's been going on for at least three or four months, and she is in the middle of a really messy divorce.'

Ms Cho, 41, split from her husband Evan Gottlieb over the summer and moved out of their Yonker's mansion with her daughter to a Upper West Side apartment - where Josh has been seen leaving in the early hours of the morning.

Josh is divorced from Priya Narang Elliot, the mother of his three-year-old daughter Sarina, while Ms Cho has a five-year-old daughter called Louisa Simone.

The TV hosts were first spotted having 
dinner together in Manhattan in September sparking rumors of a fledgling
relationship, but at the time friends said it was not a serious romance
and they had been on a few dates.

'Trust issues with females': Josh Elliott has clashed with co-star Lara Spencer, right, but has a better relationship with Robin Roberts, left

On the GMA set, Josh has repeatedly clashed with co-host Lara Spencer 
over trivial issues, including how stories are covered, and the pair's off-air relationship is anything but amicable.

‘It's
no secret that Josh has major, major issues with women. Josh had a 
difficult childhood and as a result, has trust issues with females,' a source told Radar.

'He is extremely insecure and needs constant validation from everyone 
around him about how wonderful he is and what a great job he is doing.'

'The only female Josh hasn't fought with is Robin Roberts, because he respects her for her previous work at ESPN, the source told Radar.

'He is high maintenance, and if viewers could see what he was like off the air, people would be truly shocked.'

Elliot
was given up for adoption at birth. Then at 12 his adopted parents 
divorced and his father, who had told the family he was gay, died. In 
recent years he has made contact with his birth mom Susan and, briefly, 
with his biological father too.

Good Morning America is the most popular morning show in the country, but Lara Spencer, left, has reportedly clashed with her male co-hosts

‘I
got to thank Susan for my life, for not aborting me, for having the 
strength to ask that she be blindfolded in the delivery room (she said 
she never could’ve gone through with it, had she seen me) so she could 
give me what she believed would be a better life,’ he told The Big Lead 
in 2009.

The
upbeat vibe and jovial mood of ABC's Good Morning America is one of the
key reasons it has toppled rival NBC show Today in the morning ratings 
battle this year.

On
camera at least, Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos, Josh Elliott, 
Sam Champion and Lara Spencer have created a winning formula.

Robin
Roberts is currently absent from the show while she receives treatment 
for the blood and bone marrow disorder MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndrome). 

Roberts
is considered a steadying influence on the show and insiders say things
are more fraught in her absence. Co-anchor George Stephanopoulos 
particularly misses her professionalism and isn't a fan of Lara Spencer,
who has been standing in for Robin.
