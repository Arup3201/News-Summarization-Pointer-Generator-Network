West Bromwich Albion have made an improved bid for Callum McManaman with Tony Pulis determined to land the Wigan winger.

An offer understood to be £3.5m was rejected by the Championship strugglers, but Albion have returned with a revised deal of around £4m.

Wigan are thought to want as much as £6m for the 23-year-old, but may agree to a smaller fee as manager Malky Mackay is eager to reshape his squad.

It is believed the transfer will eventually go through with both clubs working to that outcome.

Pulis has already spoken of his desire to sign two players before the end of the January transfer window, with the Baggies having also been linked with a £5m swoop for Leicetser forward Jamie Vardy.
