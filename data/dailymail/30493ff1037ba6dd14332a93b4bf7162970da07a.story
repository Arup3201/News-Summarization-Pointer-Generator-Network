Mo Farah is set to win his battle to be fit for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

The double Olympic champion has shrugged off the abdominal complaint which ruled him out of the weekend Grand Prix in the Scottish city.

Both Team England and Farah's management team have confirmed there is no change to the 31-year-old's plans to compete in both the 5,000m and 10,000m events.

On Tuesday, UK Athletics performance director Neil Black eased fears over Farah's medical issues, insisting: 'Mo has had some challenges with his health which have all been dealt with and he is now phasing back into full training.

'He is really positive about things and he is thinking optimistically about the summer.'

Farah also tweeted about his return to fitness along with pictures of him training. He said: 'In Font Romeu... Trainings going good!! next stop..... commonwealth Games...!! Shabba'.

Farah has also been named in the 75-strong Great Britain squad for the European Championships in Zurich next month.

Farah will remain at his altitude training base in Font Romeu to continue his preparations for the Commonwealth Games, which means he will not feature at the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games this weekend.

But British Athletics has confirmed that world and Olympic medallist Bernard Lagat will compete in the men's two-mile race on The Mall.

'We are delighted that Bernard Lagat will headline the men's two-mile race at the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games,' British Athletics chief executive Niels de Vos said.

'This race sits alongside the men's T54 two-mile race featuring multiple Paralympic champion Dave Weir, returning to the scene of his fourth gold medal in London 2012, and the women's mile race featuring Geneze Dibaba, world indoor champion and world record holder.'
