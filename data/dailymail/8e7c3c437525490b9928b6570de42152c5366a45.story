She was the young cancer sufferer pictured sitting on the knee of Diana, Princess of Wales, at the royal's final official engagement before her tragic death.

Hollie Robinson Marsh beat cancer as a child but has now sadly passed away after the leukaemia returned, 17 years after the photo was taken.

The girl was just four when she met the Princess at north London's Northwick Park Hospital children's ward in July 1997.

Hollie Robinson Marsh was four-years-old when she met Diana, Princess of Wales, during the princess's visit to Northwick Park Hospital

Recalling the day, her mother Claire Robinson from Ruislip, London, told MailOnline: "To Hollie it wasn’t a big thing, but Hollie was always that kind of person. You could introduce her to The Queen and she’d be the same way as she is with everyone.

'She just treated everyone the same. She was very natural with Princess Diana. Hollie was always just a very easygoing child.' 

The subsequent image of their encounter was published around the world and was eventually used as an official photo accompanying a £5 coin marking Diana's death.

Ms Robinson, 46, said: 'She was excited about it and over the years she was always happy to talk to other children and take her coins into school to show the class. It was always something that she looked at.' 

Hollie recovered from her illness and, inspired to help others by the Princess, went on to study childcare at school.

Her last official engagement in Britain was on 21 July, when she visited Northwick Park Hospital, London (children's accident and emergency unit)

Two years on, Hollie showed off the souvenir coins of her meeting with Diana, Princess of Wales, which inspired her in later life

Hollie began working for a children's organisation at 16 and was there until she died, aged 21

By the age of 16 she had a part-time job with  Kids Can Achieve, a Harrow-based organisation offering support to youngsters with special needs and their families.

And she was still working there when, on her 21st birthday, she had the shocking news that her cancer had returned.

Ms Robinson said: 'Doctors told us it was a one-in-a-million chance.'

She went on: "Hollie never said “why me, I’ve had it once, why have I got to have it again?” 

'She always said to the doctors "it’s new for me because I don’t remember having it last time, but my mum’s going through it twice."

'Hollie didn’t want anyone’s sympathy. She just wanted her life back.'

Diana, Princess of Wales, also met a youngster called Camila Fiocco during her visit  to Northwick Park Hospital

Despite the fact that her 18-year-old brother Jake was ready to be a bone marrow donor so his sister could undergo a transplant, Hollie became seriously ill from the chemotherapy and radiotherapy she received, eventually leading to multi-organ failure. 

And when details of her funeral were put on Facebook, hundreds of friends got in touch with family.

In the end, around 400 people came to the service, many lining the road to Breakspear Crematorium.

Her mother said: "Looking back on it now I can see she was put here for a reason. There was a reason why we had her for those extra 17 years. She was made to look after those children.

'It’s inspiring in the fact that she met Princess Diana who loved children and Hollie went on to work with children with special needs. She was a remarkable person in that respect.' 

Simon Jarrett, the chair of Kids Can Achieve, said her passing is a huge loss to both the staff she worked with and the children they care for.

He told MailOnline: 'We are terribly shocked and saddened by her death.

'She'd worked with us from the early days of our organisation. She is somebody who had gone through great trials herself and the gave up a career to work with children with very high levels of need.

'She was a great worker and friend and we'll all miss her greatly. It's a really shocking loss we've suffered.'

During her visit to the hospital, her last official engagement, Princess Diana, also met a girl called Camila.

The four-year-old, who lost her hair during chemotherapy, was one of the patients who saw the Princess unveil a foundation stone for the children's casualty centre.

The Princess spotted the child in a bright floral dress and cuddled her as she spoke to her Brazilian-born mother, Anna Fiocco. 

Leukaemia is the most common form of blood cancer in children. Leukaemia is a blood cancer that affects the white blood cells, a really important part of our immune system that fights infection.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALA) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are forms of cancer which affect blood-producing cells in the bone marrow.

When a child has leukaemia, control of blood cell production breaks down. The bone marrow - the soft tissue in the middle of our bones where all our blood cells are made - makes lots of abnormal white blood, or leukaemia cells.

These never mature into proper white blood cells, vital to a healthy immune system, and so children with leukaemia are at more risk of infection.

Now nine in ten children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) - a remarkable turnaround for a previously untreatable disease.

The cure rates for children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are now around 65 per cent.

The photo of Hollie meeting Princess Diana was eventually used inside a presentation package featuring a £5 coin to mark the princess's death
