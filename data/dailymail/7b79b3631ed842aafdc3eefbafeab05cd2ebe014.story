Follow live coverage as David Moyes takes his Real Sociedad side to Santiago Bernabeu to take on the La Liga leaders Real Madrid (kick-off 3pm).

Sociedad are 11th in the standings, some 26 points behind Carlo Ancelotti's men but Moyes will hope to mastermind an unexpected victory as he did against Barcelona earlier this month.

Moyes will serve the second of a two-game touchline ban following his sending off against Villarreal and so will watch from the stands.

Real Madrid will be without the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, who was handed a two-match ban for an altercation in last weekend's match in Cordoba.

They could hand a debut to 21-year-old Brazilian midfielder Lucas Silva, who joined this week from Cruzeiro for £9.7m.

Join Jack Bezants from 2pm for live coverage with updates from Pete Jenson in Madrid.

David Moyes leads his Real Sociedad team to the Santiago Bernabeu to take on Real Madrid

Not an enjoyable day for David Moyes. His side took the lead in the first minute through Aritz Elustondo but they could only hold on for two minutes before James Rodriguez made things level. Carlo Ancelotti's side powered on from there and were denied several times by Geronimo Rulli before Sergio Ramos put Real 2-1 up. A double from Karim Benzema in the second half, including an absolutely astonishing second, pulled Madrid further out of sight and had it not been for Rulli, things could have got very humiliating for Moyes.

Real Madrid 4-1 Real Sociedad

Rulli blocks Hernandez from point blank range, another great save! Not long left here at all for Sociedad to endure.

No hat-trick for Benzema today as Javier Hernandez replaces him for the final moments of the game. Toni Kroos is also withdrawn and Sami Khedira takes his place.

He may have conceded four this afternoon but Geronimo Rulli has kept the score down from Madrid's ruthless attack. He is one of the few players Moyes will be pleased with today.

How is it not five? Gareth Bale is denied by Geronimo Rulli after racing clear of the Sociedad defence and while it is another great save from the goalkeeper, you would expect Bale to hit the back of the net with the amount of time he had. 

It started so well for David Moyes, but the game has proved to be as miserable as the weather in Madrid today. He has not been able to repeat his Barcelona heroics and the Scotsman will want to forget today as quickly as possible.

76 - Benzema gets his second of the match and it is the best goal of the game by far! The France striker has been superb for Carlo Ancelotti's side and he gets his second in stunning style. He plays the ball into Isco, who returns it to him on the edge of the area before lashing an astonishing strike across goal that bends up into the top corner. Rulli does not have a chance with that, incredible strike!

Real Madrid 4-1 Real Sociedad Karim Benzema

James Rodríguez, scorer of Madrid's first goal, is done for the afternoon. He leaves the field to a rapturous reception from the Real supporters and Jese replaces him. 

Marcelo joins Illarramendi in the book for Real, after putting in a rather brutal challenge on Agirretxe. Madrid now seem to have taken their foot off the gas, but the damage has been done to Sociedad. There is around 20 minutes left. 

It's 3-1 Real, who have been in ferocious form from the moment they fell behind to Sociedad. Here's a picture of Karim Benzema celebrating with Gareth Bale, who provided the assist for his strike, their side's third goal of the game.

Moyes uses his final change, with goalscorer Aritz Elustondo being taken off and Markel Bergara, a defensive midfielder, coming on. It looks like it might be a case of damage limitation for Sociedad.

Madrid pressing forward relentlessly now and Benzema almost had a second and Real's fourth. Bale slid the ball across the penalty area from the left and it needed a touch from Inigo to direct the ball away from the attacker. Meanwhile, here is a shot of Sergio Ramos celebrating after putting Madrid 2-1 ahead. It is hard to believe that they were ever trailing this game, even if it was for only two minutes.

It's a sublime goal from Madrid, who instantly undo any defensive reassurance that Moyes' decision to swap Canales for De la Bella may have brought. The France striker exchanges passes with Bale on his way into the penalty area before slotting cooly past Rulli. 3-1, and it has been coming.

Real Madrid 3-1 Real Sociedad Karim Benzema

It is an interesting swap from Moyes. Canales has the potential to provide Madrid with some concern with his attacking forays but he has been hooked in favour of a defender, who Moyes will no doubt hope can offer some reassurance in their own third of the pitch.

Moyes has made a second change of the match, taking off Sergio Canales and replacing him with Alberto De la Bella, a left-back.

But a powerful header from James Rodriguez levelled the scores after three minutes. Sergio Ramos put the hosts ahead on 36 but Marcelo has been the key player for Madrid, carving David Moyes' side open with ease. If they stop him, they may have a chance of getting back into the game.

Real Sociedad's players celebrate going ahead against Real Madrid in the first minute at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Bale sent a free kick over the bar after Benzema was chopped down by Inigo Martinez. At half-time, the score is 2-1 but Pete Jenson, Sportsmail's man in Madrid, says 'Real Sociedad will do well to have kept this at 2-1.' It all started so well for Moyes, as his side went ahead in the first minute through Aritz Elustondo but James Rodriguez swiftly pegged them back before Sergio Ramos put the Champions League holders into the lead.

It should be 3-1! How is it not 3-1? Bale has just found himself all alone, only Rulli to beat with Rodriguez and Benzema either side of him and he has missed the target completely! Moyes is furious, absolutely furious. Bale is equally as embarrassed.

Benzema's initial chance came from another cross from Marcelo, who seems hell bent on causing the destruction of Sociedad today. His movement is clever, his passing accurate and incisive and Sociedad just can't contain him.

36 - There is only so much Rulli can keep out. He does exceptionally well to block Benzema's initial shot but the rebound falls to Sergio Ramos. The defender doesn't need a second invitation and stabs the ball home. Finally, Madrid have the lead.

Real Madrid 2-1 Real Sociedad Sergio Ramos 

Asier Illarramendi has the first yellow card of the game for a late challenge on Pardo after 31 minutes.

James Rodriguez is now denied by Rulli, who beats away a fearsome strike from the Colombia international. Madrid come again, but Benzema's header is very high and Rulli watches the ball sail over the bar. This is a tough test of Sociedad's defensive credentials.

This is an ominous sign for Sociedad and Moyes. Gareth Bale has 11 goals in 11 games for Madrid when Cristiano Ronaldo has not been in the side. In an end-to-end opening 10 minutes, Bale's involvement was minimal but he has just forced a corner after his fierce shot was deflected out of play, and Sociedad eventually scramble the ball away.

Rulli to the rescue for Sociedad and it is Marcelo who is again the creator. He threads an enticing ball through Sociedad's defence and into the path of Karim Benzema, who has his chance smothered by the onrushing goalkeeper. Madrid are growing into this now.

That substitution is not something Moyes would have wanted to have done so early in the game and he will hope it does not upset the organisation of his team. He has not lost in six encounters against Carlo Ancelotti and he'll be desperate to extend that run today.

And it is Imanol Agirretxe who replaces Vela after 17 minutes.

Not what David Moyes wants to see here. Striker Carlos Vela hobbles off and Alfred Finnbogason starts warming up. Imanol Agirretxe is another option. Real are starting to look a little bit more comfortable after a frenetic opening 10 minutes.

But Rodriguez's strike has not deterred Sociedad, who could not get much closer to taking the lead again. Esteban Granero's shot from the edge of the area is weak and finds the path of Sergio Canales, who stick his foot out and diverts it narrowly wide of the post. The score remains 1-1 but if the game continues in this manner, it won't be for much longer. 

It was a tremendous header Rodriguez, sending a cross from Marcelo into the roof of the net and leaving goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli with no chance.

What a start here! Moyes was in dreamland... but his joy lasts only two minutes as James Rodriguez swiftly levels for Madrid. Three minutes gone and already there are two goals!

Real Madrid 1-1 Real Sociedad

It has not taken Sociedad any time at all to stun the Santiago Bernabeu! One of the young players that Moyes has pushed into the first team, Aritz Elustondo, gets the goal with a header from a corner!

Real Sociedad 1-0 Real Madrid

Pete Jenson is at the game for Sportsmail: Two former Real Madrid players in Real Sociedad's line-up and both Esteban Granero and Sergio Canales were given warm welcomes by club staff when they arrived at the stadium just over an hour ago. Gareth Bale starts for Real Madrid - his record when he plays without Ronaldo in the side is  11 goals in 11 games. Madrid expects more of the same today.

And here is how Sociedad will line-up at the Bernabeu

Confirmation here of the Madrid starting line-up
