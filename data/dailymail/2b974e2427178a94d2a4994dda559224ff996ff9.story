The director of the Kony 2012 video was suffering from 'reactive psychosis' when he was filmed running through the streets of San Diego naked and ranting about the devil, his family have said.

Invisible Children co-founder Jason Russell was taken away by police responding to complaints about him cursing, potentially 
masturbating and pounding the pavement at an
intersection last week.

Russell's wife Danica and other relatives have said he was suffering from the condition due to stress, exhaustion and dehydration after his video of the Ugandan war criminal granted him overnight fame.

Disturbed: Kony 2012 co-founder Jason Russell was caught having his public meltdown on camera

'The preliminary diagnosis he received is called brief reactive psychosis, an acute state brought on by the extreme exhaustion, stress and dehydration,' the family said, the Los Angeles Times reported.

'Though new to us, the doctors say 
this is a common experience given the great mental, emotional and 
physical shock his body has gone through in these last two weeks.'

The statement 
hinted that the criticism of the Invisible Children video may have 
contributed to Russell's extreme behavior. He had devoted his adult life to the cause, it said.

'Because of how 
personal the film is, many of the attacks against it were also very 
personal and Jason took them very hard,' it added.

Critics had lambasted the video about
 militia leader Joseph Kony as incorrect, claiming it had made mistakes 
about the current violence in Uganda and the strength of Kony's forces.

His family added it had expected 'a few thousand people' to watch the film - now seen by 84 million people around the world.

Arrested: Jason Russell, director of the 'Kony 2012' video, was allegedly seen wandering the streets

San Diego police took father-of-two Russell to a mental-health facility for observation after he was spotted running naked through a Pacific Beach neighbourhood last Thursday.

Earlier this week, TMZ released a close-range video of 
Mr Russell pacing back and forth along a busy San Diego sidewalk, 
shouting: 'You're the devil.'

Witnesses had called police to report
 'the underwear-clad male was in the street, interfering with traffic, 
screaming, yelling incoherently and pounding his fists on the sidewalk',
 police said.

Russell was calm and 
co-operative when apprehended by police, according to NBC San Diego, but
 seemed to be under the influence of alcohol. Danica denied her husband has any substance abuse or drinking problems.

Although he was not charged with a 
crime, officials decided that Russell should be committed to hospital for 
medical treatment following the incident.

'During the evaluation we learned that 
we probably needed to take care of him,' a police spokesman said.

'So 
officers detained him and transferred him to a local medical facility 
for further evaluation.'

His family concluded: 'The focus remains only on his health, and protecting our family. We'll 
take care of Jason, you take care of the work. The message of the film remains the same: Stop at nothing.'

Ben Keesey, chief executive of 
Invisible Children, the charity set up in 2004 by Mr Russell and two 
friends, issued a statement of support for his colleague.

'The past two weeks have taken a 
severe emotional toll on all of us, Jason especially, and that toll 
manifested itself in an unfortunate incident yesterday,' he said.

'We will always love and support Jason, and we ask that you give his entire family privacy during this difficult time.'

The Kony film has prompted a response from the Prime 
Minister of Uganda, saying that the warlord at the heart of the video is
 not in his country.

Amama 
Mbabazi said that the charity's video gives a 'false impression' and 
that Joseph Kony is no longer in the country.

'The
 Kony 2012 campaign fails to make one crucial point clear. Joseph Kony 
is not in Uganda,' Mr Mbabazi said in a nine-minute video posted on 
YouTube.

Critic: The Ugandan prime minister Amama Mbabazi insisted the Kony 2012 video did not represent 
the current situation in the east African nation and that the government was already on 
Kony's trail

Target: Mr Russell's video is aimed at Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony

The Prime Minister insisted that the Kony 2012 video did not represent the current situation in the east African nation.

Mbabazi said Uganda was on Kony's trail but said they did not 'need a slick video on YouTube... to take notice.'

The charity, which aims to raise 
awareness of the atrocities committed by the Lord's Resistance Army in 
Uganda, sprang to worldwide fame last week after releasing an online 
video entitled 'Kony 2012'.

The 30-minute film documents the activities of LRA leader Joseph Kony, notorious 
for his reign of terror in central Africa and particularly his use of 
child soldiers.
