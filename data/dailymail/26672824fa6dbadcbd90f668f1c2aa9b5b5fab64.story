Lengthy tenure: Sir Bruce Forsyth has hosted Strictly Come Dancing for 10 years since its inception

The show is a Saturday night must-see for millions of children.

But as far as Sir Bruce Forsyth is concerned, they should remain watching Britain’s Got Talent rather than taking part in it.

The 85-year-old TV veteran attacked Simon Cowell for allowing youngsters to take part in his ITV show claiming it is an ‘ordeal’ for many of them and results in many of them crying.

‘I don’t think that’s entertainment,’ he said. ‘I don’t think they should put children on that are too young.’

Sir Bruce, who plans to return as presenter of Strictly Come Dancing – the BBC’s rival to another Cowell show, The X Factor – in the autumn, added: ‘If you’re going to do that, have a separate show. Have a children’s show, British Children Have Talent.’

Yesterday Safer Media, a charity that campaigns for family-friendly media, backed Sir Bruce and called for a ban on children under 16 taking part in TV talent shows.

The criticisms emerged as Saturday night’s instalment of the show saw several acts made up of children – some as young as five. Many were in tears at the end as the pressure of being judged became too much.

One young girl in dance troupe Pre-Skool, comprising 13 five to eight-year-olds, started to cry as she waited for the judges to decide whether they would go through to the next round.

Youth Creation, 33 children aged between seven and 14 from Essex also took part, with many of them becoming emotional at the end.

Irish teenagers Jack Duff, 13, and Cormac Connell, 14, gave an impressive rendition of Of Monsters and Men’s hit Little Talks but also appeared on the verge of breaking down as they waited for the panel’s verdict.

Even Cowell acknowledged their 
performance was good but not great because nerves had got the better of 
them on the show, which topped Saturday night’s ratings, attracting more
 than ten million viewers –three million more than BBC rival The 
Voice.

Miranda Suit from Safer Media said: 
‘Shows like this are emotionally intense and you are best to have a 
minimum age and one that is suitable would probably be 16. We tend to 
put entertainment on a pedestal in this culture.

‘People are so careful about using 
animals in entertainment and we want to be even more careful about what 
we expose children to.’

Scenes of children breaking down in 
tears have become all too common on BGT, with Sir Bruce recalling how 
one girl of 11 was left in tears.

A spokesman for the show said: 'The 
welfare of all contestants is our number one priority and we have 
stringent procedures in place relating to children who appear in our 
programmes.

'Children are accompanied by a member
 of their family or a guardian at all times and a psychologist is on 
hand at all auditions.

'We also employ registered chaperones at our judges’ audition days and live shows to monitor the children’s welfare.

'As there are a limited number of performances Britain’s Got Talent does not have an age limit.'

Feeling the pressure: Dance troupe Pre-Skool looked nervous

Hundreds of viewers complained in 
2009 when two child singers, Hollie Steel and Natalie Okri, cried due to
 the pressure of performing live.

And last year Britain’s Got Talent 
had to defend its lack of an age limit when nine-year-old Malaki Paul 
broke down in tears after struggling to finish his song because of 
nerves.

Last month child welfare campaigners 
questioned whether five-year-old Jordan Nash should have been put 
through to the next round. While the youngster, from London, received 
positive comments from the judges, there were concerns that he is too 
young to cope with fame, should he progress to the final stages of the 
competition.

Jordan, dressed in a black baseball 
cap and a T-shirt with his name on it, performed an impressive dance 
routine and was given a ‘Yes’ by all four judges.

But viewers called the decision ‘inappropriate’ and called on ITV to bring in new rules to ‘stop this happening’.

Saturday’s BGT also provoked outrage over sexual references on the pre-watershed show.

Kelly Fox, a 71-year-old grandmother,
 performed a song called Kiss My A** containing the lyrics: ‘‘I came 
home a little early, I couldn’t believe my eyes, you were lying there 
butt naked with a woman between your thighs.’

TV watchdog Mediawatch-UK attacked 
Ofcom and ITV for screening  the performance following criticism of a 
lap dancer earlier in the series.

Mediawatch-UK director Viviene 
Pattison has asked the Government’s child protection tsar Claire Perry 
to investigate sexualised content on shows aired before the 9pm 
watershed.

She said: ‘The ratings are falling 
and ITV is just pulling out the stops. First we had the lap dancer Keri 
Graham and now this granny.

‘It is inappropriate. BGT is going all out to shock and Ofcom is simply under-regulating the show'
