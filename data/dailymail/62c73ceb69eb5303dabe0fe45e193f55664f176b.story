A couple  definitely managed to leave their mark on each other when they got married at a tattoo convention and were inked with each others' initials instead of exchanging rings. 

Dani Cook, 25, had been looking forward to a traditional white wedding when she arrived to tie the knot with Adam Butler, 29, at Alexandra Palace in London.

But instead of the intimate ceremony and beautiful castle setting she had hoped for, the council worker was met with a hall crammed with 10,000 ink-loving strangers.

Wedding bells: Dani Cook, 25, and Adam Butler, 29, married at a tattoo convention in front of 10,000 strangers

Adam had been tasked with arranging the surprise ceremony as part of a TV reality show but decided to hold the entire thing at the tattoo convention in London. 

The wedding venue shouldn't have come as a complete shock for the bride, as the fun loving couple from Torquay, Devon, are mad about tattoos and even have matching ones. 

'I have 22 tattoos in total including a portrait of John Lennon and Dani has around 11,' revealed bar manager Adam. 'I have a king of hearts suit on my finger and Dani has the queen on hers.

'Because of our love of tattoos, I thought the convention would be ideal for us. But it wasn't just the event that I was sold on: the venue and it's grounds are stunning and I was blown away by it.

'It was hard to carry the tattoo theme throughout the day, especially at the reception, but I think I managed to pull it off.'

Happy: The pair cut their cake which, like the rest of the wedding, also had a colourful body art theme

Instead of exchanging rings at the altar, Adam arranged for a tattoo artist to ink the first letter of their names on each others' wedding ring finger.  

Even though the bride spent most of the day travelling from Devon to London in a minibus, that didn't stop Adam from giving Dani her special day.   

Dani admitted that although her original thoughts were 'I can't believe this is happening', she thoroughly enjoyed her unusual wedding.

'My dream was to get married in a stately home with the ceremony or reception taking place outside, but on the day all I could think about was Adam.

'The most important part for me was to have my whole family at the wedding and for my father to walk me down the aisle.

'He done well choosing my dress, but the worst part was not having any contact or any say in the plans.'

Who are you? Along with family members and friends, the guest list included everyone at the convention

Romantic: The couple have new tattoos added to their fingers in place of a more traditional ring

The newlywed's story appeared in BBC Three show Don't Tell The Bride, which sees men organise their weddings behind their partners' backs.

Producers give the groom £12,000 to plan a wedding in just three weeks - but allow him no contact with his fiancee.

As a result, the weddings can be unusual, with Adam admitting that giving him the reins was particularly risky because, he says, he is 'lazy' and never does anything around the house. 

'I wanted to show Dani that I could do it and that I don't always leave everything to the last minute,' he added.

Speaking about his unusual choice of venue, he said: 'We love to mess around and do silly things and I'd say our shared love of tattoos are just an added bonus to us as a couple.

'We both knew that we wanted to get married and we never wanted a long term engagement so it worked perfectly.

'It was incredible when the Arctic Monkeys song, Do I Wanna Know started and my wife made her entrance - I got goosebumps.'
