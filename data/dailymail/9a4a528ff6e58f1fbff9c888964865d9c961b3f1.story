It started with a simple request - just $10 to make a potato salad.

But four days after posting the straight forward-looking project to a crowd-funding website, its creator Zack Danger Brown has been inundated with offers of help.

So far more than 2,000 backers have pledged over $16,000 on the project's Kickstarter page.

Zack Danger Brown, of Columbus, Ohio, has received pledges of over $16,000 from 2,000 backers since posting the simple request of raising $10 for a potato salad four days ago

Brown, of Columbus, Ohio, has been 
creating 'stretch goals' as the money continued to pour in after the 
page was shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.

The
 initial request for $10 came with the simple pitch of: 'Basically I'm 
just making potato salad. I haven't decided what kind yet.'

He soon amended his goals to include a pizza party for $75 and two different potato salads at $100.

The latest stretch goal however, which again has been easily smashed, was to organize a potato salad party for the 'whole internet' if the project managed to raise $3,000.

Mr Brown has been adding 'stretch goals' as the amount of money raised continued to rise after the page was shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter

$1 - A 'thank you' posted to the website and Mr Brown will say your name while making the potato salad

$2 - A photo of Mr Brown making the potato salad

$3 - A bite of the potato salad

$5 - Choose a potato salad-appropriate ingredient

$10 - Hang out in the kitchen while the potato salad is made

$20 - A potato salad-themed haiku, your name carved into a potato used in the salad, a signed jar of mayonnaise and the potato salad recipe

$25 - A potato salad-themed hat

$35 - A limited edition t-shirt

$50 - A Potato Salads Of The World recipe book

Brown told MailOnline he was looking to use the money raised 'to do the most good possible'.

Asked
 why he thought people had been so keen to get involved in the project, 
he said: 'It's fun and it's creating a fun community. Potato salad has 
brought us together.

'People are offering to write potato salad themed songs and make potato salad themed iPhone apps.'

In the latest update to the page, Brown has posted a video in which he thanks all of those who have pledged money.

He
 said: 'This is amazing. When I started this campaign my secret goal was
 that we could make $60 and in three days we have made 1,000 per cent of
 that - $5,000 dollars.

'Thank you so much.'

Brown
 has also decided to give a little something back to all those who have 
pledged support with a series of 'gifts', depending on the amount 
pledged.

Those who 
pledge $3 will receive a bite of the potato salad, for $5 there is the 
chance to choose an ingredient and those who pledge $25 will receive a 
potato-salad themed hat.

Meanwhile,
 a pledge of $35 receives a t-shirt and those who pledge $50 or more 
will receive a Potato Salads Of The World recipe book.

Last
 month, Kickstarter loosened its guidelines for projects and now allows 
users to ask the internet to pay for basically anything that's not 
illegal.

Unfortunately the crowdfunding site’s terms don’t allow Brown to simply make his potato salad as originally planned and donate the huge excess of cash to charity.

Q: What are you going to do with the money?

A: I'm looking to do the most good possible with this opportunity.

Have you had any weird ingredient suggestions?

Marshmallows!!

Where did the idea come from?

It's potato salad season over here in the States so everyone is talking about it!

Why do you think people are so keen to get involved?

It's fun and it's creating a fun community. Potato salad has brought us together. People are offering to write potato salad themed songs and make potato salad themed iPhone apps.

How big will this potato salad be – how many people is it going to have to feed?

We need to get 1,000 bites. That's a lot of potatoes!!

How much will it cost to make?

No idea, sorry!

I know this is your first potato salad, but do you have much experience in cooking in general?

I follow Reddit.com/r/slowcooking and generally make whatever they're recommending.
