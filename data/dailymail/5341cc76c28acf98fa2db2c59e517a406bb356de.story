Lorry drivers are being ordered to avoid Calais because of confrontations with knife-wielding illegal immigrants who are trying to get to Britain.

Cross-Channel haulage firms are advising drivers to use other ports – including Cherbourg, Boulogne and Dunkirk – to transport goods to the UK to prevent migrants clambering into their vehicles.

Up to 2,000 foreigners – mainly Africans and Asians – have massed at Calais in a desperate bid to reach our shores where they will be able to claim benefits if they fail to find jobs.

Caught out: 16 immigrants were found in a tanker that was filling up at a Calais petrol station on Saturday

The growing problem has led to calls for a new Sangatte-style refugee camp – a successor to the notorious Red Cross centre closed in 2002 that was used by 60,000 people as a springboard for illegal entry to the UK.

Angry truckers have told of desperate migrants armed with knives, iron bars and other weapons who leap on to UK-bound ferries.

At the weekend police launched a hunt for an Iraqi Kurd people-smuggler who pointed a pump-action shotgun at them as they arrested 15 illegal immigrants who were attempting to stow away in the back of a wagon parked in Calais.

And three Sudanese migrants suffered severe knife wounds during a vicious fight in the centre of the town over the right to a favourite spot to leap onto passing lorries.

The migrants lie in wait in groups at junctions where lorries have to slow down and stop. Aided by unscrupulous criminal gangs, they risk their lives trying to open the trailers doors and jump inside before the targeted vehicles drive on.

On Saturday, 17 migrants suffering from lack of oxygen were discovered huddled inside a Dutch tanker and were rescued only after the driver heard them banging to be released – a chilling echo of the Afghan migrants, one of whom had died, who were discovered at Tilbury earlier this month.

Meanwhile, hundreds of migrants attempted to break into stationary UK-bound lorries when a motorway to Calais ground to a halt with a huge traffic jam.

Taking action: Theresa May held top-level talks with Calais officials on Friday in a bid to tackle the crisis

French Police were forced to divert trucks on other routes as the numbers of potential stowaways became so great they were unmanageable.

Now many haulage firms are telling drivers to use other French ports to reach the UK – raising concerns that new migrants camps will also spring up in those towns. Others, however, cannot avoid Calais because they have fixed-term contracts with ferry companies that depart from there.

Robin Walkam, 34, a trucker from Hartlepool, said transport company bosses had ordered drivers to avoid Calais when crossing the Channel amid fears of harm to employees and goods.

He said: ‘It is very dangerous to cross from Calais. The migrants cause a lot of damage.

‘In the old days it was easy to monitor their movements. They were much fewer. Now there are dozens at a time and they are more organised and quite capable of staging diversions.

‘It’s like being in a war zone. The only difference is that we have no body armour and can’t carry guns. Sooner or later some driver is going to get killed.’

A member of staff at a truck stop in Calais, close to the migrants’ camp, said: ‘It’s no wonder that drivers are now avoiding Calais if they can. You only have to look outside to see the scale of the problem.

‘The migrants are everywhere hanging around the trucks whilst they refill or the drivers have a meal or take a shower.’

On Friday Home Secretary Theresa May held top-level talks with French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve in a bid to come up with a solution to tackle the crisis.

Calais’ mayor Natacha Bouchart has called on the French minister to scrap British immigration controls based in France – a move that would open the floodgates to the UK – even if it ‘causes a diplomatic incident’.

She also announced plans for a ‘Sangatte 2’ hostel, providing shelter, food and washing facilities, for 400 refugees who are currently squatting in makeshift camps and disused buildings while seeking to reach Britain’s shores.

It would be built at a rundown summer camp for children on the Calais coast, less than 30 minutes’ walk from truck depots and Calais ferry terminal, with views towards the white cliffs of Dover.

She also demanded the UK would tear down its border controls in Calais – introduced in a 2002 agreement with Paris – a move rejected by Mrs May.
