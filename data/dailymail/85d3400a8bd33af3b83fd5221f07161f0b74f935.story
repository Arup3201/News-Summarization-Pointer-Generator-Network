A teenager with a rare disease who was an unofficial mascot for the New England Patriots died one day before he was due to lead them into the playoffs as an honorary team captain.

The Patriots held a moment of silence for Sam Berns, 17, before Saturday's game which saw them beat the Indianapolis Colts, 43-22 -- and scores of fans later dedicated the victory to the teen whose inspirational approach to life won him thousands of fans.

The team also held a moment of silence for Berns before the game kicked off and shared a photo of Berns and Patriots owner Robert Kraft, whom Berns befriended in the months leading up to his death. Berns suffered from progeria, a fatal
 genetic condition which causes premature aging. The average lifespan 
for patients is 13 years. Progeria is an extremely rare condition, affecting an estimated 250 children in the world.

Fans took to Tiwitter to express their condolences over Berns' death, with some writing that the Patriots' Saturday win against the Colts was for him

Kraft penned a heartfelt tribute on Saturday, and shared his hopes for Berns' family.

'I loved Sam Berns and am richer for having known him,' Kraft said. 'He was a special young man whose inspirational story and positive outlook on life touched my heart. I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to spend time with him and to get to know his incredible family. Together, they positively impacted the lives of people around the world in their quest to find a cure for progeria.'

Kraft also expressed his regret at not being able to see Berns honored at Saturday's game.

'I was looking forward to spending more time with Sam and his family. News of his passing came as a complete surprise,' Kraft said.

'It is another reminder that we can’t take anything for granted. Be sure to give your loved ones hugs and kisses and tell them how much you love them. My heart aches for his parents, Scott and Leslie, his aunt Audrey and the rest of Sam’s extended family. Words cannot express the sadness or the depth of sympathy I feel for them today.'

Berns was a junior at Foxborough High School, in Foxborough, Massachusetts. An Eagle Scout, he participated in marching band and baseball, ESPN reports.

Kraft became involved in Berns' life after reading about him in a local newspaper and invited him to a Saturday practice this past September, the website adds.

Kraft, so touched by the boy's condition, introduced Berns to the entire Patriots team. He reportedly even served as motivation for the team in its September 30-23 win against the Atlanta Falcons, NBC Sports reports.

'I asked Sam if he would be kind enough to give the team a little pep talk and tell them what they needed to do to get a win down in Atlanta,' Kraft told Patriots.com. 'He started telling them what they had to do to move [Falcons quarterback] Matt Ryan off the spot and get him to throw a few interceptions and how we could score.'

Berns is believed to have also touched the heart of quarterback Tom Brady.

'Brady was determined to be the player of the game down in Atlanta for Sam,' Kraft told the website. 'NBC gives a ball to the player who was most outstanding in the game and when I told Tom I was seeing Sam again, he pulled that game ball out of his locker, gave it to me and said, "I think Sam should have it."'

Berns later invited Kraft to a screening of  'Life According to Sam' in October. Kraft eventually donated $500,000 to the Progeria Research Foundation, according to ESPN.

Berns' family is requesting privacy until funeral arrangements are made, WCVB-TV reports. Condolesnces may be sent to the Progeria Research Foundation.
