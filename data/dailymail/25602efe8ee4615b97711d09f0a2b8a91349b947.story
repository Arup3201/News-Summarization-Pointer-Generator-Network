Inspired by Steve Irwin, a young man has quit his job to commit himself  to his goal of raising money for animal welfare through the creation of innovative paintings.

Mornington Peninsula-based artist Mtich Gobel has pledged to donate $50,000 to fund the animal hospital at Australia Zoon, donating the funds to Steve and Terri Irwin’s foundation ‘Australia Zoo Wildlife Warriors’.

‘It’s a great experience, it’s been a pretty crazy journey and it gives me a fuzzy feeling to know I can contribute to Steve’s legacy,’ said Gobel.

On Wednesday, it was announced that Gobel was halfway towards his goal and has donated $25,000 to the foundation.

Gobel will now spend two days at Australia Zoo working on the finishing touches on his custom artwork.

‘I named the painting after Steve – ‘The Crocodile Hunter,’ said Gobel.

‘The idea behind it was to incorporate animals into the design but still have it fairly abstract.

‘I wanted it to represent something like a billabong, something that was drying up and have their footprints to represent their tracks and where they have been,’ explained Gobel.

The aim is for the artwork to hang in the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital by Friday – another kind gesture from the 24-year-old art activist.

Wildlife Warriors director of development Cynthia Thompson says they are incredibly grateful for the compassionate contribution from the young artist.

‘Donations are incredibly important for the hospital, we don’t receive any regular government support so we’re an entirely non-profit organisation,’ Thompson said.

‘We depend on the gifts and generosity of individuals and companies throughout Australia and the world.’

The funds will go towards the ongoing treatment of sick, injured and orphaned wildlife at the hospital.

They have treated over 55,000 native Australian wildlife patients in its ten year history.

Nine months ago, Gobel quit his job in horticulture to pursue a life-long dream of creating art that reflects the beauty of the natural world and save wildlife in the process.

Gobel is an incredibly talented self-taught artist whose art is his ‘life and full-time occupation’.

His vision is to use his art to ‘create a voice to achieve goals in wildlife conservation'.

He is a resin artist, which according to Gobel is ‘basically liquid glass’. The resulting artwork has a beautiful, glossy finish.

Gobel has also created beautiful artworks to project his feelings about the inhumanity of whaling.

All the profits from his art were used to help fund the works of Sea Shepherd.
