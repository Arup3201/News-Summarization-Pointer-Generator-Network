It offers a prime city centre location, luxurious bedding and the ultimate panorama of picturesque Bath.

But there is one catch - everyone can see you getting ready for bed or having a soak in the tub.

Two lucky couples will be at the centre of attention when they check into the transparent bubble hotel in the historic Roman city this weekend.

The inflatable room is turning heads in the centre of SouthGate, the Somerset city's busiest shopping street, where it was set up by Laterooms.com.

'It's clearly not for the faint-hearted,' said LateRooms.com spokesman Andrea Tarpey.

'Our Bubble Room will have 360-degree views like no other hotel room, but will also be completely exposed to passers-by and will be situated in the heart of Bath's city centre.

'This will be a completely unique experience for the Bubble Room guests – they'll have all the comforts of a hotel room, but their stay will be a real one of a kind. Hopefully privacy isn't too high on their agenda.'

The capsule, measuring 13ft by 13ft (four metres by four metres) comes complete with its own six-foot high entrance tunnel, a freestanding bath, comfy bed, luxurious linen and fur throws.

It is powered by a generator and the bathtub is for display only.

Two couples are staying in the revealing hotel room for one night each after booking on LateRooms.com at £50 per night.

The Bubble Hotel is being guarded by security around the clock and guests will be able to nip to the nearby Abbey Hotel when nature calls.
