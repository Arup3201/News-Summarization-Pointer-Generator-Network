'I want to grieve': Louise Troh, 54, was trapped in confinement when she learned her fiance Thomas Eric Duncan had died of Ebola on October 8

The fiancée of Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan will be released from quarantine at midnight tonight - but will emerged with hardly any possession after they were destroyed by hazmat teams.

Louise Troh, 54, missed her boyfriend's funeral while she was locked away for the duration of the deadly virus's 21-day incubation period, which expires tonight.

During the frantic operation to seal off Duncan's apartment in Dallas and eliminate all traces of the disease, she also lost the majority of her belongings.

Only a few personal documents, some photographs, and a single Bible escaped the cleansing operation.

Speaking on Friday of her desperation to leave the quarantine - enforced by armed guards - she said: 'I want to breathe, I want to really grieve, I want privacy with my family.'

Her pastor George Mason said he is also coordinating efforts with the city, county and philanthropic community to help Troh and the family recover.

'They were left with nothing. They are completely devastated by this, so there's need to have their lives rebuilt,' Mason said.

Troh has also said she plans to repair some of the huge emotional and financial damage by writing a book about her relationship with Duncan, whom she met at a refugee camp on the Ivory Coast.

Troh, a Liberian like her fiancé, will also recount his story, including his years-long quest to come to America to be reunited with his girlfriend and their 19-year-old son, and his death in an isolation ward.

'It will be a love story,' she said.

Describing her ordeal, she said: 'My beloved fiancé, Thomas Eric Duncan, who was also the father of my son, Karsiah Eric Duncan, did not survive with us.

'We continue to mourn his loss and grieve the circumstances that led to his death, just at the time we thought we were facing a happy future together.

'Our hearts also go out to the two brave women who have been infected by this terrible disease as they were trying to help him.

'We are also aware of how much this has affected many other people of my city, Dallas, and my country, the United States of America, even as it has in the country of my birth, Liberia.

'We also know that many people who work in Presbyterian Hospital are hurting because of this tragedy. We pray that God will bring healing to all in our community soon.'

Duncan arrived in Dallas from Liberia in late September and went to the hospital complaining of headache and stomach pain. 

He was sent home with a prescription for antibiotics to treat a misdiagnosed sinus infection. 

He returned two days later, was diagnosed with Ebola and died on October 8.

Troh was told of his death while she was in confinement.

The day Duncan tested positive for Ebola, Troh, her 13-year-old son, Duncan's nephew and a family friend were ordered by a Dallas court to stay inside the apartment among Duncan's used linens and any lingering virus.

The unusual confinement order was imposed after the family failed to comply with a request not to leave the apartment, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said. The four were later taken to an undisclosed gated community. 

The other people who will have their quarantine period end at midnight include Youngor Jallah, Troh's daughter, a nurse's assistant who checked Duncan's vital signs before calling for an ambulance.

For nearly three weeks, Jallah has not left the cramped, second-story apartment she shares with her partner, Aaron Yah, their three children, ages 2, 4 and 6, and Yah's 10-year-old son.

Unlike Troh, Jallah is not prevented from leaving by an armed guard, but Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have come by daily to check everyone's temperature.

'I'm telling you, just to step outside will be so great. To hug my mom and grieve for Eric, not over the phone like we've been doing but in the flesh,' Jallah said. 

At Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas on Sunday, associate pastor Mark Wingfield said the congregation was eager to welcome Troh back.

'We look forward to welcoming Louise and her family members back to church after the quarantine is lifted and we want you to know that when that happens we will be glad to receive each one of them,' he said.
