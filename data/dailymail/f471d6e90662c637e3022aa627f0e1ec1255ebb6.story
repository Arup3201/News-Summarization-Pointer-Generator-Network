Despite crucial tips that led authorities to find Christopher Dorner, it has been revealed that nobody will be able to claim the $1.2million reward in the case of the killer ex-cop.

The rogue former police officer is believed dead after he was cornered in a burning cabin in the San Bernardino National Forest on Tuesday after a furious gunbattle with law enforcement officers.

Likely beneficiaries of the reward would have been Jim and Karen Reynolds, who surprised Dorner, who had been staying in an upstairs room in their condo near Big Bear Lake.

Big reward: Business leaders, police unions and governments across Southern California have offered a $1million reward for the capture of Christopher Dorner

Destroyed: Dorner is believed dead after he had taken refuge in a cabin that later burned to the ground

But the couple told reporters on Wednesday night that the reward would not be given because Dorner was neither arrested nor convicted in a trial, a stipulation of the cash sum.

When pressed about the reward by reporters, Mrs Reynolds said: 'No one is getting that because he needed to be captured and convicted.'

The Reynolds, who were tied up and had their heads wrapped in pillowcases, were able to break free after Dormer had stolen their car and fled the home.

The call set Dorner's final hours in motion when the car
was spotted by game wardens, who pursued it until Dorner crashed - and 
he fled to another cabin, which is now ravaged by fire.

The couple came forward to clear up earlier reports that it was their housekeepers who had surprised Dorner and were tied up in the home.

Killer: Dorner, pictured in a January surveillance tape, reportedly shot two deputies on Tuesday as tried to escape out of the back door of the cabin, killing one of them

But Dorner encountered one more 
person before his last stand - a driver whose pick-up truck Dorner stole
moments before the gunfight with officers.

The motorist, 61-year-old Rick Heltebrake, told the Los Angeles Times, that it is he who deserves the reward after he had called authorities to notify them about Dorner's latest movements.

He told the paper: 'Someone owes me $1 million. It was my call that led the officers to him.'

But he did say he was willing to share the reward with anyone else who may have helped authorities catch up with Dorner.

'I know there were two other women involved and I don’t mind parting it three ways.' 

Police departments, local governments, 
business leaders and police unions pool their money to offer a $1million
reward two days before Dorner's capture.

According to KCAL-TV, the reward was upped to $1.2million after donations by AEG, the Los Angeles Dodgers and various
business leaders and law enforcement groups.

But as TMZ reported, a technicality in the
wording of the reward offer would mean that no one is eligible to receive it.

LA
City Council sources told the site that the legislative analyst and the
city attorney were at odds earlier in the day about how the reward 
offer should be interpreted.

In the days leading up to the final showdown, Dorner gained national attention for his he was on the run and an bizarre online manifesto in which he detailed his plot to kill specific police officers.

His writings also included various shoutouts to celebrities, including Charlie Sheen, Larry David and Tim Tebow.

Los Angeles officials appealed to the public for help catching him after he killed three people, and several rewards were established to find Dorner.

The reward was announced by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa on Sunday as the initial leads regarding Dorner came up empty.
