On loan Aston Villa striker Darren Bent claims a new manager with a 'fresh approach' will give the whole club a lift following the departure of manager Paul Lambert.

The pair endured a strained relationship during their time together at Villa Park before the former England international was sent on a series of loan deals that has concluded with Derby County until the end of the season.

Lambert was sacked after a 2-0 defeat to Hull City left the Villa in the relegation zone without a Premier League win in 10 games dating back to December 7 - and Bent believes the club can move on under the right guidance.

Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: 'Aston Villa are a massive football club, a fantastic football club, and it is a shame where they are in the table. I'm sure whoever comes in will do a good job and get them out of there because they have good enough players for them to do that.

'There are some top, top players there who are maybe low on a bit of confidence but, on any given day, they can beat anyone, especially with the supporters there. With some big games coming up, I am sure the players will be able to turn it around and start looking in the right direction in the league table.

'I think maybe they just they need a fresh approach really. I don't know who they have got in mind to become their new manager but someone needs to go in there with a bit of freshness, mix things up a little bit, and just try something new.

'They are in a tough position. If someone comes in with fresh ideas, new tactics, it might just give the whole place a lift, including the supporters, the staff, everyone associated with the club.'

On returning to Aston Villa now Lambert has been sacked, he said: 'I'm not quite sure the details of the agreement but, for now, I am still a Derby player and we have got a big FA Cup game this weekend which I am concentrating on.

'It is nice to be getting minutes under my belt. Me going back to Aston Villa is out of my hands, to be honest. I am a Derby County player at the moment and I am enjoying my time here – it is nice to be playing.' 

The former England international has scored four goals in five appearances for Derby County
