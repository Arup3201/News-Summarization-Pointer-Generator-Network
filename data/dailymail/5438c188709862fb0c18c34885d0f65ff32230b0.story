A man who became the first person to win £1million on TV quiz show Red or Black has been jailed after bombarding a woman with more than 400 threatening text messages within just 48 hours.

Nathan Hageman, who became a millionaire in 2011 after winning the ITV show - which was fronted by Ant and Dec - was jailed after sending his victim abusive messages at the rate of one text every seven minutes.

The 34-year-old was jailed at Reading Magistrates' Court for four months after the woman, who is in her 30s, contacted police to report the harassment.

It is not the first time the former bricklayer has been hauled before the courts, as he had previously been jailed for attacking his former girlfriend.

In 2006, just five years prior to winning the show, Hageman was jailed for five years for attacking ex-partner Amy Edwards.

At the time, a spokesman for Reading Crown Court said: 'On November 7, 2006, Nathan Hageman pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated burglary and one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

'On December 8, 2006, he received a sentence of five years imprisonment for aggravated burglary and two years' imprisonment for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to run concurrently.

'The victim of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm named in the indictment was Amy Edwards.'

Officers swooped on Hageman last week, just 48 hours after he flew into a rage and launched his cruel campaign of text message abuse.

He was jailed on Thursday after admitting harassment and will serve at least two months behind bars before being eligible for parole.

Eight million people watched Hageman, who served two-and-a-half years of his five-year sentence for the attack on Ms Edwards, become the first winner of Simon Cowell's game show by correctly predicting red on the spin of a giant roulette wheel.

Shortly after his win he revealed how he had already blown £65,000 of his fortune on cars including a supercharged Range Rover and a BMW, a 10-day all-inclusive holiday in Cuba and an Armani watch.

Having been the first contestant to win the £1m prize, Hageman's spending included:

However, in the wake of his win, his former fiancée Jane Makepeace revealed how he threw her out of his penthouse, handing her just £60 for her cab fare.

At the time, she said: 'I thought the money would make Nathan a better person because he wouldn't have to struggle to get by, but it has just made him worse than ever.'

ITV's Red or Black was the brainchild of Simon Cowell and was hosted by popular duo Ant and Dec. 

Participants had to choose red or black on the spin of a roulette wheel, with those who chose incorrectly being eliminated from the show. 

It was the most expensive game show in television history, with a £15 million budget, and aired for a year between September 2011 and 2012 before being axed.
