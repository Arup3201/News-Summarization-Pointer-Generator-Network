In an all-too familiar echo of Tony Blair’s ‘dodgy dossiers’, the Government had yesterday published an intelligence report to support David Cameron’s case for strikes against the Syrian regime.

It concluded it was ‘highly likely’ that President Assad was responsible for launching chemical attacks against his own people.

But like the ‘dodgy dossiers’, which claimed in 2002 that Saddam Hussein had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction, Mr Cameron’s report contained the assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee.

Looking back: The Government's intelligence report to support David Cameron's case for strikes against the Syrian regime had an all-too familiar echo of the 'dodgy dossiers' from Tony Blair (pictured)

In an attempt to convince MPs and the public that attacks were imperative, Mr Cameron had released a two-page letter from the JIC, along with its one-page assessment.

But the report did not detail how spy chiefs reached their conclusions. It stated that to the ‘highest possible level of certainty’ the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons on ‘14 occasions from 2012’.

Without providing any obvious evidence, they had concluded this showed a ‘clear pattern of regime use’ of chemical weapons.

The JIC, which includes the heads of MI6, GCHQ and MI5, had found there was ‘no credible evidence’ that opposition fighters had deployed nerve agents which killed at least 350 civilians.

Comparison: Like the 'dodgy dossiers', which claimed that Saddam Hussein (pictured) had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction, Mr Cameron's report contained the assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee

But it had failed to answer a string 
of questions such as why chemical weapons were used when UN inspectors 
were in Syria, and who gave the order to deploy poison gas.

Persuasion: Prime Minister David Cameron had released a two-page letter from the JIC, along with its one-page assessment

It
 even admitted: ‘The JIC had high confidence in all its assessments 
except in relation to the regime’s precise motivation for carrying out 
an attack of this scale at this time – though intelligence may increase 
our confidence in the future.’

Acknowledging the disquiet lingering ten 
years on from the ‘dodgy dossiers’, Mr Cameron told the Commons: ‘I am 
of course deeply mindful of the lessons of previous conflicts and in 
particular the deep concerns in the country caused by what went wrong 
with the Iraq conflict in 2003.’

At the time Mr Blair justified dragging the UK into the bloody conflict by publishing two dossiers claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.

But it emerged that the evidence was limited, misleading and patchy, with chunks of intelligence ‘spun’ or fabricated.

However, yesterday’s report was markedly different from the Blair dossiers, as its language reflects probabilities rather than certainties that Assad’s regime carried out the chemical attack.

The Government had also claimed that military action against Syria would be legal even if Britain failed to get a fresh UN resolution.

In a highly unusual move, David Cameron ordered the release of a brief summary of the Government’s ‘legal position’ for launching retaliatory strikes against Assad.

The 660-word document was effectively a summary of the advice drawn up for the Cabinet by Attorney General Dominic Grieve.

The Prime Minister had told MPs the ‘excellent’ advice made it clear that intervention on humanitarian grounds would be legal even without a UN resolution.
