Shotgun Paddy’s connections are praying for better luck on Saturday when the gelding defends his title in the Betfred Classic Chase.

The eight-year-old, a six-length winner of the Warwick marathon 12 months ago, was strongly fancied for the Coral Welsh National but, after jumping away on terms first time in what was judged a false start, he missed the kick second time round prior to making an early error which left him detached.

Jockey Leighton Aspell pulled up on the first circuit ensuring he is fresh and ready for a repeat bid on Saturday. Trainer Emma Lavelle said: ‘Shotgun Paddy is perfect and it’s almost like he is asking us “when am I going to race again?”

‘Chepstow was a nightmare as he jumped away perfectly first time but never had a chance after the second start.

‘You never mind being beaten when you’ve had a fair crack of the whip — that is racing — but when something like that happens it is massively frustrating.

‘He never saw the second fence, where he made a mistake, but perhaps it was better he did that early on in the race rather than gallop round and make the mistake four fences from home. At least that way we still have a fresh horse with a great chance on Saturday.’
