Thomas Farage, the son of UKIP leader Nigel Farage (pictured) is facing court over a drunk and disorderly charge

The son of UKIP leader Nigel Farage is facing court over a drunk and disorderly charge, it was revealed yesterday.

City trader Thomas Farage, 21, was arrested at 3am in a London street earlier this month.

He did not appear for his first hearing at City of London Magistrates’ Court yesterday and his lawyers have asked prosecutors to deal with the case away from court.

The allegations are embarrassing for UK  Independence Party leader Mr Farage ahead of the May 2 county council elections, in which UKIP hopes to make record gains.

But the hearing was yesterday adjourned until May 10. There is no suggestion the case was deliberately delayed until after the elections.

Farage was arrested at 3am in St Martin’s Le Grand, a street in the Square Mile near St Paul’s Cathedral.

His lawyers asked the Crown Prosecution Service to consider medical evidence in the case, although no further details were given.

Prosecutor Catherine Baccas told magistrates: ‘There are discussions between the parties as to a more appropriate outcome.’

CPS guidelines state that low-level crimes by first-time offenders can be dealt with out of court using cautions, fines or community service if it is deemed appropriate.

A spokesman said: ‘In this particular case, the defence has asked that we take into consideration medical evidence concerning the defendant before proceeding with this prosecution.

‘It is only sensible that potentially relevant evidence should be taken into account, so we have asked the court to adjourn this case until we have received and reviewed the evidence.’

UKIP leader Mr Farage refused to comment, saying: ‘I have nothing to say, I have nothing to say, you’re ****ing in the wind with me.’

He has two adult sons from his first marriage and two young daughters with second wife Kirsten Mehr, a German broker. His first wife, Grainne Hayes, would only say: ‘I believe it’s all being dealt with by my ex-husband.’

Thomas Farage, who lives with his mother in Rochester, Kent, was unavailable for comment. He was granted unconditional bail.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
