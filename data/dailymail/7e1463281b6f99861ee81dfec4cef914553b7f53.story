Hundreds of NHS patients blighted by faulty hip replacements are embroiled in a landmark legal battle an investigation has revealed.

According to a report many have been left immobile after they were fitted with false joints made by DePuy - a medical device company owned by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson.

Lawyer Lisa Lunt is now representing 300 clients as they seek compensation payments, ranging from £25,000 to £1million.

Angry: 57-year-old Stephen Ellis, reported that black liquid drained from his hip after the metal joint, fitted over two years ago, started to poison his bones and muscles

One patient, 57-year-old Stephen Ellis, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, reported that black liquid drained from his hip after the metal joint started to poison his bones and muscles.

The Liverpudlian is among thousands of patients 
who have had to return to hospital for a second hip replacement, as a result of the defective parts.

A hip replacement is a surgical procedure where hip joints, damaged by injury or disease, are replaced with an artificial version.

Mr Ellis, who was originally treated in 2009, told the BBC: 'Not long after the operation I had a sharp pain when I lifted my left leg.

Mr Ellis had a further operation to correct the damage in August but he claims he still needs crutches

'After two years the pain was so severe I couldn't sit down. When they drained the fluid from the joint 
it was black like dirt.

'The surgeon was amazed and said to me on a scale
of 1-10 the damage was 10.'

The ASR hip implant is made of metal 
instead of traditional materials such as ceramic or plastic and was hailed as a medical breakthrough.

Patient will receive either a general anaesthetic (where they are put to sleep) or a spinal (epidural) anaesthetic plus sedation

The surgeon will then remove the existing hip joint completely

The upper part of the femur (thigh bone) is removed and the natural socket for the head of the femur is hollowed out

A plastic or ceramic socket is fitted into the hollow in the pelvis

A short, angled metal shaft with a smooth ball on its upper end (to fit into the socket) is placed into the hollow of the thigh bone

The plastic cup and the artificial bone head may be pressed into place or fixed with acrylic cement

Metal-on-metal (MoM) hip resurfacing is carried out in a similar way - the main difference is that much less of the bone is removed as only the joint surfaces are replaced with metal inserts

But many of the metal fittings eroded faster
than expected and released microscopic metals which could have led to poisoning in the bone and muscle.

Mr Ellis added: 'I feel like an old man in his eighties. I feel robbed of my life.

'I still can't lie on my left side and can't sleep well and now have a life of continual discomfort.'

Mr Ellis had a further operation to correct the damage in August but he claims he has been left with a limp and still needs crutches.

However not all joints have failed and DePuy has denied liability for any alleged faults.

In a statement the company said: 'Clinical studies and monitoring show the benefits of 
metal-on-metal technology often outweigh the risks for many patients.'

This week a new report in the 
British Medical Journal claimed that modern, all-metal hip implants 
appear no more effective than traditional implants - and could be less 
safe.

Researchers claimed that despite metal-on-metal implants being supposedly more durable than earlier metal-on-polyethylene implants over 
the past few years, metal implants have failed at a greater 
rate.

Lead researcher Dr Art Sedrakyan, of Cornell University, New York City said the analysis 
indicates patients implanted with the metal devices are twice at 
risk of needing a repeat operation years later.

Lawyer Lisa Lunt  added: 'It's had a terrible price on my clients psychologically.

"It's broken up relationships and some clients have said they would consider taking their own life because of the pain.'

At least 50,000 hip replacements are carried out each year in Britain, usually on adults aged over 65.
