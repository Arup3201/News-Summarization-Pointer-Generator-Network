Real Madrid's new signing James Rodriguez said winning the Golden Boot was a 'dream come true' as he posed with trophy.

The 23-year-old posted pictures on Twitter with the trophy he won after scoring six times at the World Cup in Brazil.

To celebrate, the Colombian midfielder will also play in gold boots this season - and is hoping they will extend his goal scoring run.

'I was hoping to win it because I have always dreamed of winning something like this,' James told The Associated Press. 'This is also a source of happiness to my country Colombia. Because they gave me lot of strength so I could win the award.'

James' first goal against Uruguay in the round of 16, when he chested the ball down and then volleyed it in, was voted the best of the competition.

'It was something so special that will always stay with me,' Rodriguez said about that spectacular strike. He also scored the second in a 2-0 win.

'Those are goals that stay in the memory. I think I left a mark with that goal. It made us pass to the quarterfinals and that was also historic,' he said.

Now the 23-year-old must find a way into a star-studded attack already featuring Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema.

'I have big hopes, but first I have to train well and earn my place in the team so I can play regularly and win titles,' James said. 'I am now in a club that is always hungry for titles. And I think that if you want to play here you must always keep a high level of performance. And I am prepared for that.'

James' quest for playing time could be further complicated if Angel Di Maria stays with Madrid, with other clubs apparently put off by the large price tag for the Argentina winger.

That would leave James competing for time with the versatile Argentine, Isco, Luka Modric and fellow new signing Toni Kroos.

'They are all stars,' James said. 'For me it is a pleasure to be with them. Even training with them. It is something unique and I hope I can play here together with them for many years.'

Rodriguez signed from Monaco in a  £63m deal after a hugely impressive World Cup with Colombia, scoring against Greece, Cameroon, Japan, Uruguay (twice) and Brazil.  

The former Porto man is the first Colombian to win the award, and in doing so has joined an elite list of players that includes Ronaldo, Eusebio and Gerd Muller.

Rodriguez will form part of a new-look midfield at Real Madrid this season, with World Cup winner Toni Kroos also joining the club.

Carlo Ancelotti's men will face Sevilla on Tuesday in the final of the European Super Cup. Real beat rivals Atletico to win their tenth Champions League while Sevilla beat Benfica on penalties to win the Europa League - the second time they have won it in the last eight years.
