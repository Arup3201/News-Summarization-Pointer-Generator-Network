One of Sgt Bowe Bergdahl's captors lost a son in a CIA drone strike in an incident that has intriguing similarities with the hit HBO Homeland, it was revealed today.

Four years ago, in an untelevised speech at an Idaho Republican Party fundraiser, Bergdahl's father, Bob, made an unusual request of his audience.

The grieving father asked attendees of the event to say a prayer for the head of the terrorist network he believed was holding his son hostage.

Prayer: bob Bergdahl (with wife Jani) made a speech making the drone claim and asked the audience to say a prayer for the terrorist holding his son hostage

'The man who we believe holds Bowe grew up on the lap of his mother learning the Koran. He is a powerful man,' Bergdahl said, according to a reporter there. 'We pray for him. He recently lost a son to a CIA missile drone strike. The fact that he didn't kill Bowe right then is incredible. So we pray for him.'

The man Bob Bergdahl spoke of was Sirajuddin Haqqani – leader of the Haqqani terrorist network.

Earlier that year, family members of Haqqani were allegedly killed in a U.S. drone strike intended for the Taliban commander.

According to a secret report created by the Pakistani government that was obtained and published by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism earlier this year, 19 missiles were fired in the February 2, 2010, attack and at least 23 people were killed.

CNN ran a report on the day of the strike confirming that 29 people total were killed in drone strikes that day in Pakistan.

That report made no mention of Haqqani’s home being hit, but CNN did quote an anonymous source as saying that Haqqani was indeed the target of the drone strikes.

A year and a
 half later, hit series Homeland would embark on a plotline eerily 
similar to the one in the story told by Bowe Bergdahl’s father at the 
Idaho GOP event in June of 2010.

In
 an episode revealing why Marine Sgt Nicholas Brody (played by Damian 
Lewis) became a terrorist after he was captured and tortured for eight 
years by Al Qaeda leader Abu Nazir in Afghanistan, Brody is brainwashed 
and becomes a devotee of Nazir and Islam.

Echoes: the incident has similarities with the plot from Homeland, in which Sgt Nicholas Brody turns terrorist after the son of his captor is blown up in a CIA drone strike

Nazir takes him back to his home, and asks him to teach his son Issa how to speak English. Brody falls in love with Issa, and, in shocking scene, witnesses the brutal death of Issa and eighty other children at his madrassa.

After this, Brody returns to the U.S. determined to seek revenge for Issa's death.

Bowe Bergdahl had written home before he was captured in 2009 about how deeply effected he was that his brothers in arms were not bothered when they ran over a young Afghan child in an armored car.

In May of 2011 Bob Bergdahl posted a video to YouTube thanking the Taliban for keeping his son safe.

'Strangely to some, we must also thank those who have cared for our son for almost two years. We know our son is a prisoner and also a guest in your home,' he said.

While his son was gone, Bob Bergdahl reportedly studied radical Islamic politics, the Bergdahl family’s former pastor told the Washington Post, and he kept a beard like the ones adorned by Bowe’s captors.

Bergdahl says he grew the lengthy beard to remind people how long his son had been gone, but skeptics believe the patriarch might have had an ulterior motive for keeping his facial hair long.

A few days before Bowe's release, Bob, sent the following tweet to a website that claims to be the ‘Voice of Jihad’: ‘I am still working to free all Guantanamo prisoners. God will repay for the death of every Afghan child, ameen.’

The tweet has since been deleted.

In a video posted by the Guardian on the weekend his son was released, Bob said he was just 'a father who wants his son back.’

His critics say he’s taken it too far, though. Friends of the Bergdahl’s worry that Bob may even have developed some sort of Stockholm syndrome, Henley said.

Meanwhile, Fox News reported on Thursday that Bowe Bergdahl was more than just a prisoner in a Taliban commander’s home.

According to documents based on eyewitness accounts that were obtained by Fox, after an initial period of harsh treatment, Bergdahl became a Taliban confidant and converted to Islam and jihadism while in captivity.

'Bergdahl enjoys a modicum of freedom, and engages in target practice with the local mujahedeen, firing AK47s. Bergdahl is even allowed to carry a loaded gun on occasion,' the report claims, according to Fox. 

'Bergdahl plays soccer with his guards and bounds around the pitch like a mad man,' it continues.

'He appears to be well and happy, and has a noticeable habit of laughing frequently and saying "Salaam" repeatedly.'

Salaam means 'peace'.

At
 that time, Bergdahl was being held in Pakistan by Haqqani Network 
commander Mullah Sangeen or men who are close to him, the report says. 
Not Sirajuddin Haqqani himself, as Bob Bergdahl claimed.

Claims: Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken today said that trying Bergdahl in the court of public opinion was 'repugnant' before he could defend himself. It followed reports that the POW had converted to Islam and even declared 'jihad' while in captivity

A retired U.S. Marine Corps General who served as CENTCOM commander for two years when Bowe Bergdahl was being held prisoner said the claims made in the documents were not true, though.

'We were always looking for actionable intelligence,' he said, referring to the military and the intelligence community. 'There was never any evidence of collaboration.'

Meanwhile, deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said trying Bergdahl in the court of public opinion was 'repugnant', The Hill reported.

He said 'we have seen no evidence' of the claims that Bergdahl converted or declared jihad, adding: 'The idea that we are trying Sergeant Bergdahl in the court of public opinion in absentia, without giving him an opportunity to give his story and to tell us what happened, frankly, I find repugnant'.

Blinken concluded: 'We don't know what happened. We are determined to get to the bottom of it. The military will investigate appropriately. Let's get the facts before we rush to judgment.'
