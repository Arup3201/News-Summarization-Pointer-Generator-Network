The French media today reacted mockingly to Mr Cameron’s refusal to pay Britain’s EU budget contribution – likening him to an angry diner out of Fawlty Towers.

All major outlets highlighted the Prime Minister’s fury, with the Dauphine Libere running the headline: ‘Angry Cameron refuses to take out his cheque book for Europe’.

Europe 1 radio station was typical of those which took up the Fawlty Towers theme, portraying Mr Cameron as the kind of ranting and very dissatisfied restaurant customer who used to visit Basil Fawlty’s hotel in the 1970s comedy sitcom starring John Cleese.

Ridiculed: French media today reacted mockingly to Mr Cameron’s refusal to pay Britain’s EU budget

Europe 1 writes on its website: ‘A diner unconvinced by the proposed EU menu, David Cameron refuses to pay the bill.

‘It has to be said this is a bit rich, because Brussels is demanding an additional two billion euros from Britain as part of its share of EU budget.

‘Faced with this request, the British Prime Minister has abandoned the traditional English reserve to rant at a press conference that was held on Friday.’

Le Parisien runs a picture showing Mr Cameron with his mouth wide open, and suggests that he was forced to act in such an angry manner by the success of the UK Independence Party.

Mocked: Le Parisien said David Cameron's angry reaction was really prompted by the recent success of UKIP

‘Under immense pressure from Eurosceptics, notably since the last European elections which saw Ukip win more than 27 per cent of the vote, David Cameron believes that this demand does not support the issue of Britain being in the EU,’ the Paris daily wrote.

Like many other papers, L’Express and Le Monde concentrate on the reaction of Francois Hollande to the growing crisis, quoting the clearly irritated Socialist president as saying: ‘Respecting treaties is for everybody.’
