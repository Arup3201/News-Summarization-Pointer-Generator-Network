Something quite ­magical happens when great-grandmother Paddy Jones dances. ­Shimmering in sequins, with a salsa swivel of the hips, she is ­transformed from the 79-year-old that she is into the ­nimble young woman she once was.

In the arms of her Spanish dance ­partner, Nico Espinosa — 40 years her junior — the years melt away as he tosses her in the air in a series of graceful, gravity-defying moves which would leave most ­pensioners needing an emergency hip replacement.

‘Nico throws me round like a whirling dervish. But I don’t even feel stiff ­afterwards, which is really quite amazing,’ explains Paddy, who last Saturday became an ­overnight sensation when her ­Britain’s Got Talent audition was shown.

She even managed to wipe the ­studied, weary look of boredom off the face of head judge Simon Cowell, who actually ­apologised for pressing his red buzzer to vote her off before he realised how good she was. Quite a feat in itself.

Gold tickertape rained down on her snowy white hair — which was perfectly shampooed and set — when Cowell’s ­fellow judge Amanda Holden, pressed the golden buzzer, ­catapulting Paddy into next month’s live semi-finals.

Quite how Paddy and Nico plan to top last Saturday’s performance remains to be seen, but let’s hope it won’t require the ­presence of an ­ambulance waiting in the wings.

‘I know my limits,’ says Paddy. ‘Nico wanted to try out a new move in rehearsals which involved going down on my haunches.

‘Well, I managed to get down, but I couldn’t get up again. We had to scrub that.

‘Sometimes Nico will get out the crash mats when we are trying something new, but he has never dropped me yet. I trust him completely.’

The 79-year-old made it into the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest ­acrobatic salsa dancer

Sarah ‘Paddy’ Jones is the perfect ­Britain’s Got Talent contestant, ­possessing the essential ‘wow’ ­factor and a ­moving back story.

A trained ballerina, she started dancing at the age of two-and-a-half and became a ­professional ­performer until she gave it all up after marrying her late ­husband David.

Paddy, a former dental nurse and fabric shop owner from ­Stourbridge, West ­Midlands, who retired to Spain with David in 2001, only took up dancing again ten years ago.

Devastated after her husband’s death from leukaemia in 2003, she found herself widowed and alone in a foreign country. Their four adult ­children and grandchildren were back in Britain, although they tried to visit as often as possible.

So to fill her lonely evenings and learn to have fun again she started taking salsa classes at Nico’s dance academy in Gandia near Valencia.

The rest, as they say, is television history. Today Paddy is being hailed as the dancing equivalent of Susan Boyle, who in 2009 stunned the BGT judges and the world when she sang I Dreamed A Dream from Les Miserables.

When I meet her, the gloss has been somewhat wiped off her achievement, with some critics ­suggesting she had no right to be on the show. 

In the wake of her jaw-dropping performance it emerged that Paddy and Nico — far from being plucked from obscurity — had in 2009 won a Spanish TV talent ­contest called Tu Si Que Vales (You Are Worth It). The following year the couple ­competed in the ­Argentinian ­equivalent of Strictly Come Dancing, from which they were voted off in round 11.

That year, Paddy made it into the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s oldest ­acrobatic salsa dancer.

On Twitter, Cowell defended his newest star, saying ‘Don’t knock Paddy . . . she is ­British and wants the chance to perform in front of the Royal Family.’ A spokesman for BGT, made by Thames TV and Cowell’s ­production company Syco ­Entertainment, added: ‘Anyone can apply for ­Britain’s Got Talent, ­irrespective of their past ­experience.

‘None of the judging panel had seen or knew of Paddy before her audition and her act was a ­complete surprise to them.’

Paddy, who will be 80 in July, finds it hard to understand what all the fuss is about. ‘I’m British and I’ve got ­talent, so why shouldn’t I enter?’ she asks, slightly flummoxed by the ­brouhaha. ‘It’s a terrible thing to admit — ­neither of us knew anything about the show. I think my son Philip mentioned it to me. I really didn’t think we’d stand a cat’s chance in hell of ­getting through.’

Despite the furore, who could ­honestly begrudge this soon-to-be octogenarian her late-life moment in the sun? ‘I’m very active and young at heart,’ explains Paddy, who has seven grandchildren aged from eight to 32, and a great-grandson aged three.

‘I once overheard one of my son’s friends at a fancy dress party asking “Is your Mum ever going to grow up?” I’d come as a pirate.’

The only child of a regimental ­tailor, Paddy performed in her first panto aged 12 and was working full-time in theatre when, aged 17, she met David, an electrical engineer.

‘When we married I gave it up — it was my choice — because if you’re working six days a week on stage you are going out for an evening show just as your better half is coming home from work,’ says Paddy.

‘I missed dancing terribly, ­especially as David had two left feet and didn’t know the difference between a quickstep and a waltz. But I never once regretted my ­decision. Family life was more important.’

Daughter Lesley, now aged 55, was followed by three brothers Nicolas, 54, a scout leader, Andrew, 51, a ­computer scientist and Philip, 49, a partner in an accountancy firm.

Paddy says she finds it hard to understand what all the fuss is about

Paddy kept her interest in ­showbusiness alive by founding the ­Stourbridge ­Pantomime Company — still going strong today.

The couple, happily married for 47 years, retired to Spain after Paddy collapsed on Christmas Eve 2000 with flu and David said he couldn’t let her endure another ­British ­winter.

They fell in love with a mountainside villa in Gandia, and had sold their semi-detached ­Victorian home in the Midlands when disaster struck.

The day before they were due to fly out to sign the paperwork, David fell ill and was rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. The Spanish villa lay empty for eight months while David ­underwent several rounds of ­chemotherapy — keeping a picture of their dream home by his hospital bed to give him a morale boost.

With David’s cancer in remission, they finally moved to Spain in ­September 2001, only for the ­leukaemia to return 18 months later. He was given two months to live after two further rounds of chemo failed.

‘I put his bed in the lounge ­overlooking the valley, but when the doctor came he said David had a week or ten days left,’ says Paddy.

‘Our children made ­immediate plans to fly out, but David died the exact time their plane took off from Britain. When they arrived I had to tell them, “I’m sorry, it’s too late, he’s gone.” ’

In the wake of her jaw-dropping performance it emerged that Paddy and Nico had in 2009 won a Spanish TV talent ­contest called Tu Si Que Vales (You Are Worth It)

‘By the end he was skin and bone, so I was prepared for his death and held him in my arms and talked to him at the end. Everyone assumed I would come home, but I was determined to stay because we’d been so happy.

‘I kept myself busy, gardening all day until it got dark and then ­falling into bed exhausted. I didn’t have a ­television, so when autumn came I thought I’d better find something else to keep me busy.

‘I was the oldest person at Nico’s by far, but salsa is very inclusive. Men over there don’t think, “Oh, I can’t dance with an old lady.” ‘

‘I think Nico was quite ­surprised by what I could do,’ says Paddy, who is 4ft 11 and a ­featherweight 7st. ‘One day he asked me how much I weighed and said “Bien” when I told him.

The first time he tried to throw me in the air, he  asked some other men to stand around him to catch me if I fell, but I just went for it. I didn’t even worry about being injured.’

Paddy describes her relationship with Nico, who is unmarried, as being like that of mother and son.

It was his idea to start entering ­competitions: ‘He couldn’t find someone willing to be thrown up in the air except a silly, elderly widow.

So could Paddy and Nico win ­Britain’s Got Talent? ‘It would be an absolute honour for me to perform in front of the Queen,’ says Paddy. ‘I went into dancing again because I was on my own. I had lost David. I just hope he’d be proud of me now.’
