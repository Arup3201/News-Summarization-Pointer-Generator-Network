The fashion photographer allegedly hit the couple's 11-year-old son during a meeting at Cheeburger Cheeburger restaurant in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn, New York.

Charles’ lawyer has claimed that his 
client was set up during the meeting on June 6, 2012 at the fast-food 
joint and that instead it was Dillon who beat his client with a cellphone.

The trial is expected to begin on February 4.

According to a lawsuit filed by Mr Charles, it is Ms Cypress who used their son to lure him to the burger spot where he was attacked by Dillon.

According to court documents, Dillon attacked Charles with a 'hard object', knocking him down and causing a concussion.

The couple then made up a sequence of events that led to Mr Charles spending six nights in jail, according to Charles' lawyer Robert Feldman.

Ms Cypress, who has most recently starred in TV series Blue Bloods and The Good Wife, was married to Mr Charles from 2000 to 2004.

She played the character Simone Deveaux, an art dealer without any special powers, in Heroes in the 2006-07 season.
