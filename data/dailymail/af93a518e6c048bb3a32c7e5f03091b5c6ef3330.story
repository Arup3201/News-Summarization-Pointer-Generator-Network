Ron Medich, the property developer accused of murdering businessman Michael McGurk, has sold his huge harbourside mansion.

His plush pad situated in Point Piper, Sydney, has reportedly sold for between $37 and $38 million.

Ken Jacobs of Christies International, who listed the stunning property, told Daily Mail Australia: 'I can't confirm the price. All I can say is it was sold last night to an Australian buyer.'

Grand design: The house features large windows that look out over the water onto the city. When lying on the stylish sunbeds you will also get a great view

With a turqoise sculptured pool and stylish modern design, featuring large windows that look out over the water onto the city, it would be no surprise if the home at 112 Wolseley Road earned a record price.

The property's new Australian owner can enjoy their own private jetty, plus panorama views of Sydney's iconic Harbour Bridge, the CBD's office towers and the Opera House from their back garden.

The building is described as a 'world-class contemporary harbour view residence', on estate agent LJ Hooker Double Bay's website.

'The postcard style views create a sense of seamless extension of this substantial home's multi-level layout,' the site says.

It's the perfect home for any A-lister looking for privacy, as it's hidden from the road and has a 4-car private garage.

But if the owner doesn't want to drive into town, they can jump into a water taxi from the jetty. 

Seriously stylish: The house was designed by leading architect David Katon and is the perfect pad to throw a party

Pull up a chair: The steel kitchen and breakfast bar is a magical place to grab a snack. There is also a built in bar stocked with the finest drinks

The building also boasts cutting edge security and a 'no expense spared approach to luxury and personal comfort'.

Elevators transport residents to all levels of the accommodation, which includes five bedrooms all featuring ensuite marble bathrooms.

White room: One of the lounge areas features pristine white sofas and chairs with plump looking cushions to lean back into and take in the views

Not a bad place to work: The office area of the house is incredibly unique. It boasts white leather recliner seats for visitors to sit on during meetings

Sweet dreams: The new owner can wake up to views of Sydney's blue Harbour while laying in a large cream and white bed

Ensuite: Every one of the house's five bedrooms features its own marble bathroom, including a large shower and bath that looks out onto the water

There are also separate self contained quarters 'ideal for guests or live in staff'.

Millionaire Mr Medich scooped up the house for $15.15 million in 2003 with his now estranged wife Odetta.

Mr Medich is now awaiting trial for the 2009 murder of Mr McGurk, 46, who was shot outside his Cremorne home on September 3, 2009.

Mr Medich has pleaded not guilty and has firmly maintained his innocence since he was charged in October 2010.

He will stand trial in the Supreme Court in late August.
