Cameras can do strange things to people's faces.

Having one around can cause natural expressions to transform into stiff smiles or ridiculous pouts.

Now, one Oxford-based company has developed a camera to banish these photos and instead capture 'real life' moments without the user ever having to click a button.

The Autographer is a small 5 million pixel camera with an 8GB internal memory and a 3mm focal length lens

The stealth 'Autographer' is a five-megapixel camera with a 136-degree wide-angle lens and features five on-board sensors to detect changes in light, motion, direction, colour and temperature.

It is clipped to a shirt pocket or hung around your neck and decides itself when to take a picture.

With no viewfinder and no preview screen the Autographer will give you a visual record of wherever you go.

By monitoring changes in colour, temperature, motion and acceleration, the camera will decide when and where to take pictures – so there is an element of luck involved.

Developed by Oxford-based firm OMG Life, the camera also pinpoints location using GPS allowing users to see exactly where their photographs were captured.

The device can store up to 16,000 images on its internal memory but also syncs up with iPhone and Android smartphones so users can view and edit photos on the go.

Simon Randall, head of OMG Life, said: ‘The Autographer creates greater memories by capturing “real life” rather than “posed life” images.

‘It allows people to completely enjoy and experience the moment without having to pause to take photos - perfect for live music events or more sentimental moments such as childrens' first steps.

‘Autographer ensures the best moments which may otherwise be missed are always captured."

The Autographer is available is available in Europe and the US from the OMG website for £299 or $399 with the app available on iTunes and for Apple phone users.
