London's commuters are well known to be a hard-nosed bunch.

And this video perhaps proves that theory - as even a man dancing wildly to techno doesn't seem to rouse these commuters on the packed Underground.

In hilarious footage, the gentleman - thought to be called Nathan - jumps around, throws his arms in the air and even does the robot on a central London platform to the dance track Sandstorm by Darude.

Surprised - and often bemused - commuters watch on as a man, thought to be called Nathan, dances outrageously to techno on the London Underground

Despite his smooth moves to dance track Sandstorm by Darude, many of those waiting for a train just ignore the man (pictured) - instead looking straight ahead in a bid to avoid him

His moves certainly gain some strange looks - but few even crack a smile let alone join him in his performance.

At one point, two alarmed looking women and a man tentatively make their way past the dancer - attempting not to look directly at him as they pass.

Another woman then stares at the man as he moves past her before rapidly turning her attention back to her newspaper.

One man, wearing a pair of large headphones, completely ignores all the action as it takes place next to him - instead focusing on the tube tracks ahead.

The footage later shows the man flailing around outside Oxford Circus tube station.

There, commuters made a point of moving out of the man's way - keeping quiet a distance between themselves and the dancer as they trudge past him.

At one point, the footage shows three teenagers glaring at the man before making their way in to the station.

The man continues to strut his stuff up and down the station, despite many commuters glaring at him

Later, the man can be seen dancing outside Oxford Circus tube station (pictured) - where shoppers look equally unimpressed with the dancer's moves

The dancer later takes to the lift to show off his moves - much to the evident disdain of one main (bottom left) who looks terrified at the man's moves

Later in the video, which has gained over 20,000 views since it was posted online two days ago, the man can be seen dancing in a lift.

There, one man looks terrified at the man's impressive moves - scratching his chin and occasionally looking tentatively into the camera lens.

The video was filmed and posted by Trollstation Vlogs.

Many viewers have reacted to the footage - which was posted on YouTube by the site.

Rikkerry25 said: 'All these people are lame as f***. It just goes to show you how so many people get so caught up in the daily grind that they forget to have fun and do something out of the ordinary.﻿'

Another, Sebastian Strnad, wrote: 'Would of joined in but that's just me.'

Carl Geers added: 'Dance your ass off man! Dance till you drop!﻿'﻿
