Carlos Condit will return to the Octagon for the first time in over a year to take on Thiago Alves at UFC Fight Night 67.

Condit hasn't fought since March 2014 after he tore his anterior cruciate ligament during the second round of a clash with Tyron Woodleyat UFC 171.

The former interim champion has been undergoing rehabilitation ever since but will make his long awaited return to the cage in May.

Alves himself has only just got back to competing regularly having also spent time out with injury.

He went more than two years without a fight after picking up a problem during a March 2012 defeat to Martin Kampmann.

But the Brazilian is back to both fitness and form having beaten Seth Baczynski and Jordan Mein.

A venue has not yet been revealed for UFC Fight Night 67 but a decision is expected soon, as is an undercard for the headline fight.
