Pressure to avoid offending minorities has caught up with Britain’s 150,000 users of sign language for the deaf, according to a Government-funded report.

It found that younger deaf people have changed the way they give the sign to say someone is gay, or to describe Chinese, French and Jewish people.

The old gesture that meant gay – a flicked limp wrist – is now considered offensive among some users of British Sign Language, researchers at University College London said.

Evolving: Britain's young deaf community have adapted signs they use so they don't offend other cultures

Similarly it is no longer acceptable among politically correct deaf people to give a slanted eye sign to indicate something Chinese, nor to mime a hooked nose to mean a Jewish person.

Over three years, scientists at the Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre at UCL filmed the signs for more than 100 words used by 250 people in eight cities.

Centre director Professor Bencie Woll said: ‘The younger deaf community doesn’t use these old signs because of a clear process of political correctness, in the same way that the hearing community no longer calls gay people “pansies” or “queer”.’

Young deaf people have also dropped the sign of twirling an imaginary moustache for France, said the researchers.

They sign a gay person with an upright thumb on one hand in the palm of the other, wobbling from side to side, and India is signed using the triangular shape of the subcontinent.

Professor Bencie Woll, director of DCal, said that the changes to sign language were much like the changes to spoken English

She said the change in sign language 
has been faster because when signers began to communicate over the internet
 they could see for the first time how 'foreign signers referred to 
themselves'.

Young deaf Britons have changed the way they sign certain words, including gay, Chinese and Jewish

British Sign Language (BSL) is the preferred language of between 50,000 – 70,000 people within the UK.

Within Britain the most common form of Sign Language is called British Sign Language (BSL).

Sign Language is a visual means of communicating using gestures, facial expression, and body language.

Sign Language is used mainly by people who are deaf or have hearing impairments.

Records exist of a sign language existing within deaf communities in Britain as far back as 1570.

British sign language has evolved, as all languages do, from these origins by modification, invention and importation.

Thomas Braidwood, an Edinburgh teacher, founded 'Braidwood's Academy for the Deaf and Dumb' in 1760 which is recognised as the first school for the deaf in Britain.

His pupils were the sons of the well-to-do.

His early use of a form of sign language, the combined system, was the first codification of what was to become British Sign Language.

She told the Guardian: 'The younger deaf community
 doesn't use these old signs because of a clear process of political 
correctness, in the same way that the hearing community no longer calls 
gay people 'pansies' or 'queer',' she said.

'But what the hearing community 
doesn't understand about sign language is that even though the 
traditional signs are now considered offensive, they are not producing a
 real-life insult when they are used because they are not just visual 
representations of a concept.'

The revelation follows a study by the British Sign Language Corpus Project which has been studying how deaf people use sign language.

They have filmed and interviewed 249 deaf people from 
eight cities across the UK.

Dr Kearsy Cormier, who was in charge of the three 
and a half year project, hopes that deaf children will benefit from the findings.

She said it would give deaf people a better understanding of regional variations in sign language. An online dictionary is expected to be created following the research.

However, there are concerns among the deaf community about these changing signs and new political correctness. 

Gwilym Morris, from the deafness cognition and language research 
centre (DCal) at University College London, told the newspaper: 'We are nervous about this being seen as 
another example of political correctness because the changes are more 
about evolution rather than dictat of some body that approves language.'

Those who took part in the survey, which was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council,  were filmed in pairs and had to recount a personal experience, engage in a 30 minute conversation and participate in an interview on language awareness and attitudes.

They also had to elicit 102 signs known to vary across the UK.

Today the only acceptable way to sign China is 
to indicate the shape of a Mao jacket, while the sign for a Jew is to make the shape of a beard

It is no longer acceptable to point to the middle of their foreheads as the sign for India - instead they make the triangular shape of the subcontinent
