A New York teen’s Facebook posts have led to his arrest for making terrorist threats against the police.

Osiris Aristy, 17, who lives in Bushwick, Brooklyn, posted a series of status updates that included emojis of policemen with guns pointed at them.

A criminal complaint states that the posts ‘caused New York City police to fear for their safety’.

Aristy was arrested on January 18 at 2:46 a.m. at his home on Wyckoff Avenue near Himrod Street.

While the specific posts and photos mentioned in the criminal complaint have either been deleted or are locked down, others remain with the same emoji combination of the policeman with the gun aimed at his head

In addition to making terrorist threats, his charges included criminal possession of a weapon, criminal use of drugs and criminal possession of marijuana, DNAinfo reported.

Routine Facebook monitoring by the police showed Aristy posted selfies with guns and marijuana joints, in addition to the emoji status updates threatening to kill cops.

Police then received an arrest warrant from District Attorney Ken Thompson's office.

Specific posts include a January 15 photo of Aristy with a revolver and rounds of ammunition captioned: ‘feel like katxhin a body right now’.

This was followed by a post that read: ‘N***a run up on me, he gunna get blown down'. There was then an emoji of a police officer with three gun emojis pointed at it, according to a criminal complaint.

Aristy's Facebook profile features many photos of him either smoking or preparing joints and blunts either alone or with friends

Later that night, Aristy posted: ‘F**k the 83 104 79 98 73 PCTKKKK’, again followed by the police officer emoji with two gun emojis pointed at it, according to the DA’s office.

Aristy then wrote: ‘U know how I rock skrap’.

‘As a result of this conduct, the defendant has caused informant and other New York City police officers to fear for their safety, for public safety, and to suffer alarm and annoyance,’ the criminal complaint reads.

Other posts include one from January 17 of him with a gun and a marijuana joint sticking out of his waistband, with the caption '.38 on me I do hits in my tims’.

Some of the posts in question appear to have been deleted from his Facebook page, but others remain.

When police arrested Aristy on Sunday, they found a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson firearm in his bedroom and more than 25 grams of marijuana in his living room packaged in 21 Ziplock bags.

Hi bail is set at $150,000 and he is due in court next Friday.

Police take posts to social media very seriously.

‘You make a threat on the internet, we’re going to be watching,’ 83rd Precinct Inspector Maximo Tolentino said. ‘We are going to attempt to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.’

Aristy’s attorney Fred Pratt said that his client’s Facebook posts did not constitute ‘an actual threat’ against the police.

He said that many people on Facebook use the gun and police emoji together without it meaning an actual threat to officers.

Police told a meeting of Bushwick Community Board 4 that Aristy has 12 prior arrests including for robbery, assault, possession of marijuana, disorderly conduct, and possession of a weapon

‘I understand that people found what he said distasteful and uncomfortable, but he never threatened to take action against police,’ Pratt said.

He had no comment on the weapon or drug charges.

Aristy was already known to police and has a lengthy rap sheet.

At a Bushwick Community Board 4 meeting on Thursday, Tolentino made it clear that Aristy ‘was not a good guy’ having already ‘targeted this community on numerous occasions’.

He has 12 prior arrests, including for robbery, assault, possession of marijuana, disorderly conduct, and possession of a weapon.

As recently as October he pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree after he attacked people on two separate occasions in robberies, once with a beer bottle and a second time  with a knife.

in the first incident,  Aristy and five others repeatedly beat a man with beer bottles before taking cash and a cell phone on Greene Avenue near Wyckoff Avenue at 4:45 a.m. on May 18, 2014.

Aristy is due in court on February 20 in relation to two separate robberies that took place in May 2014 in which the victims were beaten with beer bottles and had a knife held to their throat respectively

The victim suffered dizziness, bleeding, and cuts and bruises to his face, according to a criminal complaint.

Within 10 days, on May 27 at 3:00 a.m., he and another person placed a knife to a man's neck, knocked him to the ground and again took cash and cell phone.

Aristy’s plea deal for those crimes included six months in jail, which he has already served; five years of probation, and a court-mandated program of counseling, drug testing and school monitoring.

His next court date for the robberies is set for February 20, and the conditions of the plea deal may well change in light of the emoji terrorist threats.

Aristy's attorney had no comment on the previous charges.
