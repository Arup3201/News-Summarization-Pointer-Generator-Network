One moment Jen Whitelam was opening her front  door, holding her daughter’s hand to take her out for the day.

The next, she was sprinting back through the house with her child as a 32-ton lorry careered towards them.

The young mother described the terrifying moment she saw the driverless truck heading for her front door – and how she outran it as it smashed into her home. The kitchen, where she had been feeding 23-month-old Bella a few minutes earlier, was demolished.

Seconds from death: Jennifer Whitelam, 23, dived for safety with her daughter Bella, when this out of control truck rolled towards her front door as she was leaving

Miss Whitelam, 23, was halfway out of her front door with Bella at 8.40am when she saw the lorry.

‘It was literally seconds away,’ she 
said. ‘If I hadn’t opened the front door I wouldn’t have seen it. To see
it coming towards us was terrifying. Bella was stood next to me holding
my hand. I didn’t have time to pick her up, I just dragged her to the 
back of the house.

‘As we started to run, the sound of it coming through the wall was like nothing I have ever heard before.’

The force of the crash demolished Miss
Whitelam’s home in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, and crushed her £8,000 Ford
Focus car which was parked on the driveway as the vehicle came through.

Shock: Jen Whitelam, 23, with her daughter Bella inside her two-bedroom property where the truck left a huge hole in the wall

Wreckage: Jen's kitchen where she was eating breakfast five minutes before the lorry crashed in through the side of her rented two-bedroom property in Swadlincote, Derbyshire

Damage: A large hole the truck punched in the side of the property. It could be Christmas before Jen is allowed back into her rented home

Her lucky escape came after the driver
got out of the vehicle and forgot to apply the handbrake.The part-time 
dental assistant, added that she believes she and her daughter would 
have died had the crash happened minutes earlier.

‘The house was shaking and it was awful,’ she said.

‘The first thing it hit was my car, it
totally smashed it. And then it came through the kitchen. We had been 
eating breakfast there a few minutes before. If we had been five minutes
longer, we would have been dead.

‘It’s a good job my car was out there,
I think that slowed it down. Otherwise it might have come through to 
the room where we were hiding.’

Wrecked: Jen's £8,000 Ford Focus which was crushed by the truck as it rolled towards her property

Boarded up: Jen was walking out of the front door, right, when she saw the lorry rolling towards her - so dashed to the back of the house

Wreckage: The hole has been boarded up and Jen was forced to live in a hotel for three weeks while alternative living arrangements were made for her

Miss Whitelam’s sister, Rebekah, 20, was in the living room of the house and also managed to scramble away to safety.

The crash caused £69,000 damage and 
the single mother and her daughter had to live in a hotel for three 
weeks afterwards. They have now been warned they will not be able to 
return to the house before Christmas as repairs are carried out. The 
lorry company, JB Tool and Plant Hire, is negotiating with Miss 
Whitelam’s landlord a figure to cover the damage.

Pete Cox, manager at JB Tool and Plant
Hire, claimed that the company had reminded its drivers never to get 
out of their lorries without putting up the handbrake.

He added: ‘It’s one of those things. It is unfortunate and we apologised at the time. We have done everything we can do.’

The blundering lorry driver has apparently been disciplined by his employers.

Breakfast time horror: Jennifer, 23, holding her daughter Bella outside her property with her sister Rebekah, who was also inside when the accident happened

Damage: A hole in the ceiling following the accident in Swadlincote, Derbyshire

Battered: Damage to a wall in one of the bedrooms following the crash which happened just after Jen, 23, had breakfast with her daughter
