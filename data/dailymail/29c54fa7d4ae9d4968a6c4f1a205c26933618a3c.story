When baker Sarah Hardy placed this unappealing dish on the table for her family at Christmas, they might have assumed she had forgotten the most important task of the day - cooking the turkey.

But what looks like raw poultry is in fact an orange and rum spice cake iced with a marzipan 'skin'.

Ms Hardy said her bizarre raw turkey cake was such a hit with her relatives over the festive season she plans to start making them for her customers.

Tasty: What appears to be a raw turkey ready to be popped into the oven is in fact an orange and rum spice cake

The baker spent three days on her hyper-realistic cake, which was served on a foil tray and even featured a piece of string holding the turkey 'legs' together.

'I just made it as a one-off to freak out my family,' said the cake maker, who worked in secret at night to ensure her creation was a complete surprise on Christmas Day.

'The most unappealing thing I could think of to give them was raw meat. They're used to me doing beautiful things like wedding cakes, so this was something different.

'Nobody actually believed it was a cake until we sliced into it. When we did everyone stood up and I realised they were all crowding around to take pictures.'

The London baker, who runs her own business called Sarah Hardy Cakes, said that while her raw turkey creation might not look very tempting, it tastes delicious.

'It was really lovely, like an orange drizzle cake,' she said.

'I will definitely start making them for customers, I might do miniature ones next Christmas.'

Who wants a slice? Beneath the quirky cake's unappealing exterior lies sponge and icing

Ms Hardy is involved in the Eat Your Heart Out edible art movement, headed up by creative director Miss Cakehead, which aims to promote creativity in cake making.
