Brrrrr! We are bang in the middle of winter and, sadly, the tan from my recent holiday to Mexico is fading fast. 

Looking on the bright side, this gives me a rare chance to experiment with a pale and interesting make-up look. 

So this week I’m trying out modern Gothic glamour – a gorgeous look that’s all dark smoky eyes, deep mulberry lips and flawless foundation.

GET THE LOOK

Alluring Eyes

Naturally you’ll begin with your base. Go for the full works, applying foundation, concealer and powder to achieve the beautifully pale, creamy complexion that the Gothic look requires. 

After smoothing primer across your lids (try bareMinerals PrimeTime Brightening Eye Primer), take an inky shade and smooth it over your lids.

I used Too Faced Bulletproof Eyeliner Pencil in Black Out, which has a soft, smudgeable formula and boasts a handy blending sponge at the tip.

Don’t fret about it looking too perfect as next you’re going to blend more colour on top – I used a dark-chocolate shade called Panther from the Too Faced Cat Eyes Eyeshadow Palette, smudging it over the eye pencil to create really dark, sultry lids.

Multiple layers of black mascara will give you really long, thick, sooty lashes. I used Guerlain Maxi Lash Mascara, wiggling the wand right into the roots and along to the tips of my lashes to make sure each one was covered with colour.

Finally, it’s easy to scatter eyeshadow on to your cheeks when doing smoky eyes, so I smudge on a touch of Clarins Instant Concealer to tidy up any spills and conceal dark circles at the same time.

Beautiful Bone Structure

Yes, I’ve managed to sneak a little bronzer into this look but the object here is to add definition not colour. 

Blend Daniel Sandler Instant Tan Face Powder below your cheekbones and under your jawline to contour your face and sharpen up your bone structure. 

Blend in the velvety powder using a big fluffy brush, and you’ll have supermodel-style cheekbones in no time!

Luscious Lips

To create my Gothic pout I used a clever make-up artist’s trick. Begin by filling in your whole lip area with dark eyeliner pencil – I used Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet. 

Don't be alarmed by your matte-black lips as the effect will be softened when you smudge a glossy, berry coloured lip stain over the top – try Too Faced Melted Liquified Long Wear Lipstick in Ruby. 

The result is a luscious, wine-coloured pout that looks as dramatic as it does divine. You can get all the products I used to create this look from Escentual.com.

If you’re wary of sporting a deep, dark lip but still want to experiment with the modern Gothic look, a sheerer lipstick such as Lord & Berry Twistick in Rock & Rose will give the look a softer finish.

This is a stunning evening beauty look, and luckily the long winter nights offer up plenty of opportunities to give it a go. 

What I really love about ultra-glam make-up like this is that it calls for a similarly breathtaking outfit – a sultry dress, perhaps, and some spectacular statement jewellery. I mean, which girl doesn’t relish the chance to slip into a red-carpet gown and serious diamonds!?

Here, I’m wearing a £200,000 white-gold necklace decorated with 30 carats of diamonds, and a gorgeous £50,000, 15-carat ballroom bracelet from jeweller Vashi Dominguez.

Sadly these pieces were only mine for the duration of the photo shoot, and there was a security guard on hand to make sure I gave them back. But just draping on these gems was thrilling, nonetheless.

The good news? Head to Vashi.com and you’ll find there’s plenty to lust after in the jeweller’s more affordable range – glittering designs which boast the same fine quality but at more achievable prices. 

So excuse me while I shop for some new sparklers. Well, you know what they say: diamonds are a girl’s best friend!

Stay glam.
