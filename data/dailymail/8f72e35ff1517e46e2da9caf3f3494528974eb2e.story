Ejected from his cockpit: Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham, 35, was fatally injured in 2011

A Red Arrows aerial display team pilot who died after he was ejected from his cockpit while on the ground may have been impaired by Night Nurse medicine, an inquest heard today.

Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham, 35, was fatally injured after being ejected from his Hawk T1 aircraft while on the ground at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire.

The parachute on the ejector seat did not deploy and the South African-born airman - a well-respected and experienced pilot who was also an Iraq war veteran - died in hospital.

The inquest has now explored the possibility that the effects of Night Nurse might have played a part in his death. Central Lincolnshire Coroner Stuart Fisher read the findings of a post mortem exam report to the hearing in November 2011.

He said tests showed Flt Lt Cunningham had used Night Nurse, which includes the ingredient promethazine, the evening before the incident and, according to the report, the medication could cause some sedation and impair performance in pilots.

‘It is conceivable that side effects of this medication can include drowsiness, blurred vision, disorientation or poor concentration, and could have been responsible for a degree of cognitive impairment, but there is no way of proving this with certainty,’ the inquest heard.

However, in written evidence to the inquest another doctor reported it was very unlikely that any sedative effect had remained the following morning.

‘It's highly unlikely that the dose of Night Nurse taken on the evening of November 7 had any effects on the deceased's ability to fly a plane at 11 o'clock the following morning.’

Some of Flt Lt Cunningham's team-mates who were with him on the day of the incident told the inquest that he had appeared ‘chirpy’ and ‘jovial’ on the morning of November 8 and did not appear to be unwell or in an altered mood.

They had been preparing to fly in formation from RAF Scampton to RAF Valley in Wales when they heard a loud bang.

Flt Lt James McMillan said he was sitting in his aircraft and close to finishing his pre-flight checks, as was Flt Lt Cunningham who he could see from where he was positioned.

‘I just heard what to me seemed like an enormous bang very, very close,’ he told the inquest. ‘The first thing I thought was that there was something wrong with my aircraft because it was so close to me and I could feel it.’

Flt Lt McMillan said that once he had discounted the noise had come from his own plane he looked across at Flt Lt Cunningham, thinking he had experienced an ‘engine surge’.

‘I assumed it must have been Sean and I looked across at him and that's when I realised that things were not normal.’

Flt Lt McMillan said the canopy from the plane was missing and the ejector pole was sticking out, and he saw Flt Lt Cunningham was outside the aircraft, making him think he was going to see an ejection sequence in action.

‘I remember thinking that something appeared wrong and I expected the sequence to be happening a lot quicker, and the main thing was that I thought I should have seen a parachute in his apex,’ he said.

Flt Lt Cunningham was seen ‘windmilling’ his arms in the air before hitting the ground while still strapped to his ejector seat.

The inquest heard that he fell from around 200 to 300ft. His cause of death was found to be from multiple injuries due to a fall from height following ejection from an aircraft.

Following the incident, the RAF grounded all non-essential flying of aircraft fitted with the Mk10 Martin Baker-built ejector seat ‘as a precaution’, but flights later resumed in December 2011, with air chiefs saying they had ‘no remaining safety concerns’.

Lincolnshire Police handed over a file concerning Flt Lt Cunningham's death, but the Crown Prosecution Service subsequently said no charges would be brought in relation to the incident.

The tragedy happened just three months
 after the death of Red Arrows pilot Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging, 33, 
from Rutland, who died in an air show crash near Bournemouth Airport in 
Dorset in August 2011.

Flight
 Lieutenant Kirsty Stewart, who had also been part of the aerial display
 but has since moved to a ground-based role, told the inquest she flew 
the same aircraft that Flt Lt Cunningham had been in on November 4 and 
found nothing unusual about it.

The inquest also heard evidence in relation to features on the ejector seats relating to safety pins and the seat firing handle.

Flt Lt Stewart described an incident in September 2003 when she was an instructor at RAF Valley and had been made acutely aware of the positioning of the handle and pins in relation to the ejector seat.

She told the inquest that she had been flying with a student and became aware of a problem concerning the positioning of the handle after they had landed and were taxiing.

She said she thought that her handle had become covered by the straps used to secure her in the seat and moved into the wrong position, and it seemed she had not fully inserted her safety pin, meaning she could have been easily ejected from the plane.

‘Since that incident I truly believe that, if the handle is not correctly positioned, that seat pin will not go back in that hole.’

She continued: ‘It strengthened my belief that I was probably millimetres away from movement that meant I was ejected.’

Evidence from around 70 witnesses is expected during the inquiry, which is scheduled to last around three weeks. The inquest continues.
