Strange structures found inside a Martian meteorite could suggest that life may have existed on the red planet billions of years ago.

The meteorite, named Yamato 000593, was found in Antarctica in 2000 and is thought to have formed on Mars over 1.3 billion years ago.

Scientists believe the rock was thrown into space by a huge impact on Mars and fell to Earth within the past 10,000 years.

The discovery comes eighteen years after ‘nanofossils’ were found in a 4lb lump of rock that blasted off the surface of Mars millions of years ago.

That meteorite, named ALH84001, generated headline news in 1996 when Nasa announced it contained ‘biomorphic’ structures, tubule-like objects that look bacteria.

‘We're convinced that this is another one of the important data points that is going toward answering the big question: Was there life on Mars?’ Everett Gibson, a researcher at Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre who was involved in both studies, told NBC News.

That meteorite, named ALH84001, generated headline news in 1996 when Nasa announced it contained ‘biomorphic’ structures, tubule-like objects that look bacteria.  

The report caused a sensation but many experts maintained that the features weren't biological in origin.

He added, however, that the latest study won't answer the big question. ‘We don't come out and say we have found life on Mars,’ said Dr Gibson.

Writing in the journal Astrobiology, the scientists describe microscopic tunnels found throughout the meteorite's interior.

‘The observed microtunnels display curved, undulating shapes consistent with bioalteration textures observed in basaltic glasses,’ wrote the scientists.

They also discovered tiny blobs of carbon-rich minerals that are embedded within layers of rock, which the team claim reveals ancient weathering through biological processes.

The researchers say they ‘cannot exclude the possibility that the carbon-rich regions in both sets of features’ are the product of non-biological processes.

The team are now following up their findings with more detailed chemical analysis.
