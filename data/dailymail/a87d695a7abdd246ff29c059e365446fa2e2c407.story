Are the days of the traditional builder’s brew numbered?

Our enthusiasm for herbal and fruit teas means that Twinings is challenging PG Tips for the title of Britain’s most popular tea brand.

The company has already overtaken Tetley to bag second place, after its sales grew by 5 per cent to £107m in a year — compared to £149m worth of PG Tips.

No more builders: As the sales of black tea declines, Twinings is challenging PG Tips as Britain's most popular tea brand

Twinings has an Everyday range of traditional tea bags, but most of its growth has been driven by its herbal infusions and speciality blends, including green tea flavours such as popcorn, apple and elderflower and mango tango.

Te Grocer magazine said: ‘It’s a world apart from a cup of builder’s. The market average price of tea is about 2p a bag — this stuff sells for upwards of 29p.’

But people haven’t gone too potty on posh tea. Yorkshire Tea and Typhoo were fourth and fifth.

This follows a report from September last year, which showed that whilee sales of ordinary black tea bags have dropped by nearly five per cent in the past year, demand for green tea has rocketed by eight per cent.

Fans of the fruit and herbal infusions are opting for upmarket brands such as Twinings, Teapigs and Clipper and the biggest buyers are younger consumers who see them as beneficial for health and wellbeing.

Over the past two years more traditional tea brands such as PG Tips, Tetley and Taylors have now introduced fruit, green, herbal and decaffeinated teas to their range to cater for the nation's evolving taste in tea

PG Tips said health concerns and the average age of tea drinkers is driving a decline in sales of traditional builders' tea.

Kate Tilbury, head of beverages at PG Tips' owner Unilever adds that customers are opting for news flavours to make their drinking experience more interesting.

'The health issue is the most overriding trend. We need to drink a certain amount every day and there's a finite amount people will drink, so people switch beverages.'
