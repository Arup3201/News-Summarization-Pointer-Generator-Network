Firefighters have not yet found what caused the tragic house fire in Orrick, Missouri that killed two small boys after their mother left them alone in the house while their father was sleeping.

Roger Garrison, 3, and his brother Ashton Garrison, only 21-months, were trapped inside of their burning home just 35 miles Northeast of Kansas City.

Randy Garrison awoke to hear his sons screaming at 11:30 am and the boys mother, Tammy Willis, was not home, he told Fox 4.

A house in Orrick, Missouri burned to the ground on Tuesday killing two young children and injuring their father

Ashton Garrison was only 21-months when he died on Tuesday in a tragic fire of which the cause is still unknown

Roger Garrison,3, also died in the fire and was coincidentally named after his father's brother who died in a fire years ago

Garrison arrived home from work on Tuesday at 6 a.m. after working a 24-hour shift and went directly to bed. He saw the boys mother asleep with them on the couch.

'I Woke up hearing them screaming at the top of their lungs,' he said. 'Flames in my bedroom and flames in the hallway, flames through the whole house.'

When Garrison smelled smoke he tried to burst through his bedroom hall and when he couldn't he ran into the hallway and tripped. Something may have been holding the door to his children's bedroom shut.

'I fell over a bungee cord or something that was holding their bedroom door shut,' he said. 'I ran out the back door around to the front, started ripping the sheeting off the house and trying to punch through that way and I couldn’t.'

The Ray County Sheriffs Office asked for help from the patrol's drug and crime unit to investigate the case. They could not say whether or not something had been holding the door shut.

The home that burned down on Tuesday is entirely decimated and the cause of the fire in still unknown

Tammy's mother Marjorie Long claims that her daughter (right) pictured with her son Ashton, loved her children and would 'starve for them'

Garrison was hospitalized for burns and blisters and was never able to make it through the fire to save his boys.

Garrison claims he didn't know that the boy's mother was leaving. The couple were not married but lived together for the sake of the children.

'The mother was in the house whenever I went to sleep this morning,' he said. 'And I woke up to her not being here, but my kids were here. You’d think a parent would either wake up another adult in the house or take the kids with her.'

Willis' mother Marjorie Long claims that the daughter woke Garrison.

Long told Fox 4 that her daughter is in the hospital on heavy medication and deeply mourns the loss of her children.

'She was quite clearly upset,'  Long said to KCTV.

'Several of the 
firemen, police were holding her back because she was wanting to run 
into the still burning remains of the house to get them,' she continued.

Even though Ashton's (pictured) and Roger's parents have identified their bodies, police are still running DNA to confirm the children's identities

The cause of death remains a mystery and so does the cause of the fire but Garrison thinks arson may have been involved in the death of his two sons

'She is very loving, very caring. She puts her kids before anything else,' Long said.

'She would starve herself to make sure that the kids had food, to go without things she needed to make sure that they got what they needed,' Long continued. 

Long told reporters that their daughter is bi-polar.

Garrison told reporters that his children were very important to him.

'They were my rock, everything I had in life,' Garrison said. 'The only reason I woke up everyday was for my boys.'

'What would go through your mind after hearing your kids scream bloody murder and basically watching them die in front of you?' he asked KCTV5.

Investigators don't know what started the fire but Garrison told reporters, 'I'm still wondering if it's not arson.'

Coincidentally, Garrison named one of
his sons Roger after his brother who died in a fire a few years ago. 

Mail Online spoke with Sgt. Collin Stosberg, a spokesperson for the Highway Patrol, who said that the case is still under investigation.

Even though the parents have identified their children, officials will need to identify the boys DNA to confirm their identities.

They are not releasing more information at this time but will issue a statement once they know more about the cause of the fire and the cause of death.
