There is an 800lb elephant in the room for this Australian Open semi-final in the shape of Dani Vallverdu, but my advice would be: don’t make it personal.

Andy Murray’s match with Tomas Berdych will be won between the lines of the tennis court, although there is no doubt it can be strange for all concerned when a coach switches corners.

I experienced this in 2003 in my first match as a coach against Andre Agassi following our eight-year association. I was working with Andy Roddick at Queen’s Club and he won in three sets against Andre. The whole experience gave me a vaguely sick feeling.

The key to this match is whether Murray can maintain the more aggressive style he has been playing.

The stats don’t lie and there is a reason Andy has a 4-6 record against the Czech: too often he has tried to beat him relying on his more defensive game and most of the time it has not worked.

If I was coaching Andy, I would tell him he needs to keep playing ‘first-strike’ tennis — being aggressive with the first ball that is there to hit. He has to take the ball on if it is anywhere near the centre of the court, and must avoid giving Berdych ‘meatballs’, those more passive plays that give him the chance to belt heavy groundstroke winners.

The second serve will be crucial for Andy. He has been averaging 87mph on it here as opposed to 84mph in 2014 — an improvement, but still not enough by the highest standards. Novak Djokovic tends to average around 100mph and Murray needs to get closer to that.

If the Czech has a weakness, it is that his second serve tends to be the most predictable of the top 10, but there are already signs Vallverdu is doing a good job coaching him. Tomas is picking when to really go for a winner much better. 

Before he would strike out too soon, especially when out wide, but now he is more intelligent.

Another key for Tomas is that, at 29, he has improved his movement around the court significantly.

Conditions are going to play a part. If, as expected, it is a cool evening and the ball flies relatively slowly, that favours the greater power of Berdych. But if it is significantly breezy, then Murray’s control is superior in the wind.

Put me on the spot and I will say that there will be four tight sets, with the Brit going through to another final.

The two-time Grand Slam champion has been in fine form so far in Melbourne, aiming for a fourth final
