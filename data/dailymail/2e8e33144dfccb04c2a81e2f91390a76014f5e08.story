David Luiz claimed he was born with a genetic advantage as he explained his brilliant free-kick for Brazil against Colombia.

The former Chelsea defender scored from around 35 yards to put Brazil 2-0 up and on their way to the World Cup semi-final.

Luiz, voted man of the match after their 2-1 victory over Colombia in the quarter-final, said: ‘I think it was genetic, my legs were born like this. I hit the ball at the right point, it is difficult for the goalkeeper and I am happy to help the team.
