An anti-Islamic sign at the front of a remotely located restaurant has received a mixed reaction from Australians across the country.

Eagle's Nest Bar and Grill at Longreach in Central West Queensland, some 1000km north west of Brisbane, placed the controversial sign which read 'sorry, no Muslims,' outside of its entrance.

'2000 years ago Jesus Christ made headlines turning water into wine. The tradition continues...We turn money into beer (Sorry, no Muslims),' the full message on the blackboard read.

Eagle's Nest Bar and Grill at Longreach, in Central West Queensland, placed the controversial sign which read 'sorry, no Muslims,' outside its entrance

The sign was first posted online by local resident Helen Day, who took to the restaurant's Facebook page to complain, writing 'Just a bit surprised to see the sign up 'Sorry No Muslims' ... what's that about?'

While many took to social media to slam the business for the clearly discriminatory sign, a surprising number of reviewers showed support for the anti-Islamic sentiment.

John Hawkes, the owner of the business, told the ABC that he received over 200 phone calls about the sign, which was displayed for only nine hours.

'While the great majority are in support of free speech and are of patriotic sentiment, we have fielded too many abusive and threatening calls. For this I apologise to my family,' Mr Hawkes said.

'I sincerely hope I don't end up sanitising my every thought to the robotic degree that is evident in commercial life around us.' 

The sign was first posted online by local resident Helen Day, who took to the restaurant's Facebook page to complain, writing: 'Just a bit surprised to see the sign up 'Sorry No Muslims' ... what's that about?'

Since the original message, hundreds of people have also taken to the page to criticise the sign and urge others to boycott the business

She then added: 'I certainly won't be going into a place where my Muslim friends are not welcome!'

Since the original message, hundreds of people have also taken to the page to criticise the sign and urge others to boycott the business.

'This blackboard is a disgraceful example of racism and exacerbates fears and intolerance for decent people,' one Facebook user wrote.

'Get an education in history (yours and "theirs") and compassion and live the life you live kindly.'

However half of the reviews on the page have praised the bar for their attitude.

'We need more businesses supporting pro-Australian, non-halal, anti-Islamic sentiment. After all it's not islamophobia if they are really trying to kill us'.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the restaurant for comment. 

However a surprising number of reviewers showed support for the racist sentiment

However another outraged Facebook user described how his friend's attempt to question the restaurant over the racist slur ended with poor results. 

'A friend rang them and asked if they had a sign out front saying "Sorry no Muslims". He said "Yes, that's right",' The post read.

'He was asked "What's your reason for putting the sign there?", and he said "Just, no Muslims". When asked again "But what's your reason for putting the sign there?" he hung up.

'We were present when the call was made and confirm what was said. This is clearly discrimination and will be reported to the Australian Discrimination Commission.' 

The business is located at Longreach in Central West Queensland, some 100km north west of Brisbane

The islamophobic sign comes after a traumatic week in Sydney in which self-proclaimed sheik, Man Haron Monis took 18 people hostage at the Lindt café in Martin place (pictured: the tribute to the sieges two victims) 

This commenter was then verbally abused and threatened by another man on the Facebook page for his comment.

The mayor of Longreach, Joe Owens, called the sign 'an unfortunate thing,' telling the ABC that the town was one that welcomes 'all races and religions'. 

The islamophobic sign comes after a traumatic week in Sydney in which self-proclaimed sheik, Man Haron Monis took 18 people hostage at the Lindt café in Martin place, resulting in the death of two innocent people.

While the restaurant's sign stands as an example of the hateful sentiment that the event evoked in some Australians, many others have sent messages of solidarity by offering to accompany Muslims on public transport with the hashtag #IllRideWithYou, in an attempt dispel fears of anti-Islamic attacks.
