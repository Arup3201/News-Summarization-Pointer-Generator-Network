Schalke have signed Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic on a four-year contract after the German club activated a transfer clause in his contract.

The 21-year-old was on loan at the Bundesliga outfit, but will now remain at the Veltins Arena on a permanent basis.

A tweet from the club's Twitter account revealed the news, stating: 'Schalke have activated the transfer clause with Nastasic and he will remain at SO4.'

Speaking to Schalke's website, Nastasic said of the move: 'I am proud and happy to remain at Schalke. From day one, I was immediately a part of the team. In the future I would like to help achieve our goals as a team.' 

Nastasic made nine appearances during his loan spell at the club, including the full 90 minutes of their 4-3 win over Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday night. 

The Serbia international defender joined Manchester City in 2012, and immediately impressed in his first season at the club.

He was named City's Young Player of the Season in May 2013, but was hampered by injury for much of the following season, losing his place in the starting line-up.
