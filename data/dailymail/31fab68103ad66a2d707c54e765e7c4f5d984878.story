After suffering life-changing injuries at the hands of the Boston bombers, you would think that that fateful day would be one of pain in the memories of Caroline Reinsch and Christian Williams.

But the couple, who both sustained serious leg injuries, have said that it will always be one of joy - as they learned Reinsch was pregnant with their first child after she was rushed to the ER.

'Any pain or suffering I felt has been 
replaced with joy,' Williams told the Boston Globe. 'Discovering that I was going to be a
 father is how I'll always remember the Marathon.'

Reinsch, 39, and Williams, 41, who met through Williams' sister years prior, attended the marathon on April 15 to cheer for a friend. They settled beneath the flags near to the finish line.

As the terrifying blast went off, Williams' legs and right hand were ripped open, and Reinsch suffered a bloody hole in her thigh and a split quad muscle.

Images from the day show her being rushed away on a stretcher, while Williams is seen on the ground; she went to Faulkner Hospital and he was taken to Beth Israel.

'Is there a possibility you are pregnant?' an X-ray technician asked her when she arrived at the hospital, and she answered that no, she didn't think she was.

The couple told the Globe they had been trying to conceive since last fall without any luck.

When she left the hospital after 11 days, her first stop was Beth Israel, where she had an emotional reunion with her boyfriend, who was coming out of his sixth surgery.

He had survived the blast but doctors were still trying to save his right leg.

A few days later, her doctor called to talk over her discharge papers, the Globe reported.

'Did they give you a pregnancy test?' the doctor asked, adding that records showed a 'slight positive' for pregnancy. It was too early to tell if she was pregnant, but it looked possible, the doctor said.

'You might want to take a home pregnancy test,' she added.

She took one - which was positive - at home, before taking another in a hospital restroom down the hall from Williams' room. Again, it turned positive.

Back in his room, she told him: 'I have something for you' - before handing over the little stick.

She learned that she must have been just one or two weeks pregnant when the bomb went off. She is now more than two months along.

The couple must wear leg braces and their limbs are still scarred, but Williams told the Globe that the pregnancy has changed his life and he has never felt such joy.

They decided to go public with their brilliant news this weekend - Father's Day - and to share their story of life amid the tragedy of the bombings.

The couple has shared their progress on a blog on their fundraising website - revealing their happiness at being reunited and their battle to get back to normality.

'The best part of the last three weeks at home had nothing to do with being home and everything to do with seeing Christian every day,' Reinsch wrote after leaving hospital.

'Seeing him graduate from hospital to rehab, from bed to walker, from walker to cane, and this past weekendâ€¦from rehab to home.'
