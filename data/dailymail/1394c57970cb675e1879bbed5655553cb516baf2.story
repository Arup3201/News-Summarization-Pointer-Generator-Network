An ancient Japanese shrine dedicated to the curing of haemorrhoids, where people wash their bottoms in holy river water, has seen a resurgence in popularity.

The unusual ritual is growing in popularity as more people in Japan are said to be suffering from the condition.

According to Japanese tradition, anybody who heads to the shrine in Japan's Tochigi Prefecture simply needs to wash their naked bottom in a local river, point it in the direction of the 'holy egg' and then eat boiled eggs at the nearby temple to find themselves cured.

It also welcomes people who do not have haemorrhoids at all, on the premise that if they also carry out the ritual, they will never suffer from the problem later in life.

Its recent popularity is thought to be due to an increasing number of people suffering from haemorrhoids

The temple fell into disrepair in the 1980s but more recently after a resurgence in the number of people suffering from haemorrhoids, it has been refurbished and reopened and now has experienced a boom in popularity.

Temple priest Osamu Hayakawa said: 'In the modern world in which we live, it is not acceptable for people to be showing off their rear ends whilst public bathing in an open river but we believe that it is fine if the essence of the ritual is still maintained.

'We perform a short service and afterwards individuals come and have to point their rear end at the holy egg and say a special player.

'The devout will find that the trip to the Karube Shrine will have the desired effect.'

There is even a special holy day, known as the Kisai Festival, staged annually at the Kunigami Shrine, when visitors turn up in the hope of receiving a cure for the painful condition.

It is like many other ceremonies at Japanese temples apart from the fact that there are no benches or even cushions because most of the faithful as haemorrhoid sufferers would prefer to stand.
