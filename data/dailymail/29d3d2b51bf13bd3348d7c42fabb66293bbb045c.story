Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho insists he has no regrets over his running battle against referees this season.

The Blues manager has been outspoken in his views regarding Chelsea's treatment by officials, even claiming there is a 'campaign' against the Stamford Bridge club.

Earlier this week the club took an unusual step of posting an article on their official website claiming they had been awarded an 'abnormally low' number of penalties this season - just two in the Premier League.

Mourinho is admant he was not behind the article - but insisted he has not had any second thoughts about his stance against referees this season.

'Did I know about the article? No, I’m just the first team manager,' said the Portuguese, whose side face Hull on Sunday.

'I never regret when I speak from my feelings, I never carry it, the consequences. 'Was I surprised to see article? No. Did I think it was opinionated? No. Not for me. 'I don’t think the writer is going to win the Pulitzer with that article. It’s just the numbers.

'You gave so much importance to that article that I read it. It’s just an objective article. The number of penalties each team have in favour or against is another stat. 'It’s been working against us since the beginning of the season. That won’t change. 

'The numbers always tell the truth. It’s just pure numbers. 'No agenda, no intention. Just numbers.' Hull boss Steve Bruce was critical of Chelsea's players after the first clash between the two sides this season after two Chelsea players were booked for diving.

Willian and Diego Costa both received yellow cards for simulation in the encounter, while Bruce called a Gary Cahill tumble in the area like something out of 'Swan Lake'.

And when asked whether Bruce's comments in December has worked against Chelsea, the Blues boss added: 'I don't know, I don’t speak about it. I can’t. 'I’m punished, I don’t want to spend my energy thinking about the negative decisions and the points it cost us.

'I just want to focus all my energy, and now we have lots of time for that, which we didn’t when were in all the cups.

'So we focus on the training, analyse opponents, I want to focus on that. Two months to go and in two months we can be champions.'
