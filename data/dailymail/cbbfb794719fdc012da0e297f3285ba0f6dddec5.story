Ms Walch, had heard foxes were common at the campsite in the north-west of Canada, and so decided to put some food out in a bid to entice the animals and create a picture perfect moment

The schoolteacher fed the foxes for several days and happily took a few pictures before accidentally leaving her camera equipment unattended only to glance up and discover one snap happy creature poised behind it.

Shocked, Ms Walch, from Innsbruck in Austria, quickly grabbed a spare camera to capture the hilarious moment.

She said: 'At first I put a few leftovers around my van so that the foxes would come close to me and I could get a better view.

The clever creature looked as if he had truly mastered the art of photography as he appeared to aim the camera expertly (left). Then once his photoshoot was complete, he licked his lips with satisfaction

'After a short time I could see five foxes. I was impressed by them because they were all so different.

'They were very suspicious at first but over a couple of days I still managed to get a few nice pictures.

'One fox seemed instantly interested in my camera equipment but I couldn't believe it when one day I looked up and saw her trying to be a photographer.

'She even tried to press the shutter and I couldn't help but laugh. It was very impressive to see though.

'Foxes are often mistaken for odious animals but they are actually gorgeous creatures and very clever too.'
