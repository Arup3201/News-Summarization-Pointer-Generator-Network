A British couple worth more than £45 million have been arrested after allegedly being caught up in in a lewd incident in a U.S. nightclub toilet.

Police say tycoons Chris and Mary Gorman were found in the Roxy Club in Orlando, Florida, with her performing a sex act on another man as her husband watched.

Mrs Gorman has also been charged with possessing cocaine and battery after allegedly lashing out at a police officer.

He has been charged with interfering with a police officer who was trying to arrest his wife.

They were, however not charged with indecency, and the man in with them was released without charge.

Mr Gorman, 44, has made a fortune from his digital companies The Reality Group and The Gadget Shop, while Mary is also an entrepreneur, and they live in a £2 million mansion in Renfrewshire, Scotland.

The pair now face court after the incident in August, with Mary due before a judge on November 23.

The arrest affidavit for Mary, filed by the City of Orlando police officer Noah Pruitt, says: 'One of the club employees informed me that a white male, black male and a white female, later identified as defendant Mary Lang Gorman, were possibly having sex in the men's restroom.

'As we entered the men's restroom, I noticed the stall was locked.

'Once the stall door opened, the white male was watching defendant Gorman performing a sex act on the black male.

'The
white male and black male exited the stall, exiting the bathroom. 
Defendant Gorman was still inside the bathroom and was asked to leave 
several times.

'Defendant Gorman turned around and pushed me in the chest with an open hand.

'The
white male was later identified as Christopher Gorman. Search incident 
to arrest: defendant Mary Gorman black purse contained a black wallet. 
Inside the wallet were two pieces of white paper containing a white 
powdery substance.

Honoured: Chris and his wife Mary pictured when he received his OBE for services to business in 2005

'Based upon my training and experience in street level narcotics, the substance appeared to be "powder cocaine".'

In a statement the couple told 
MailOnline: 'We are obviously horrified by this as, although the arrest 
did happen, we firmly do not believe that we have done anything to merit
the charges or treatment we received.

Self-made man Chris Gorman accumulated his huge fortune in just 15 years despite coming from an impoverished background.

Living in a council house he went on to help organise Live 8 in Scotland and enjoy a millionaire’s lifestyle. 

With homes in Scotland and Spain, it is believed he is worth at least £35 million on his own.

Handed an OBE six years ago for services to business, he has also spent large periods encouraging and investing in young entrepreneurs.

The former mobile phone salesman's wealth came after he set up DX Communications with a friend, and from a humble investment of £25,000 it grew to 170 shops, which was sold for £4.2million, which he took a quarter of.

After investing this money in internet services, he sold his next business for £35 million, and has continued to make more money from other ventures.

He is still involved in the mobile and internet sectors with Truphone and Media Corporation as well as music and lifestyle companies like Lucid Group, ChartsNow! and Quintessentially Group.

His wife was also from a modest background but is also now a multi-millionaire from her own businesses, working in technology, music, and beauty sectors.

She is also an ambassador for Action for Children Scotland and a supporter of the Prince’s Scottish Youth Business Trust.

'We
totally refute all the charges and have appointed an attorney in 
Orlando who fully expects a successful resolution in due course. This is
an already horrendous situation for us and our children so anything 
that can be done to limit this would be very much appreciated.

'We are horrified by this.. we do not believe we have done anything to merit the charges.'

On August 13 Richard Roman was working alongside Pruitt, and it was he who arrested Chris Gorman

'I knocked on the door and it was opened by a white male later identified as Christopher S Gorman,' His affidavit says.

'With the door opened, both Pruitt and I observed the white male, a black male and a white female inside the stall.

'We ordered all of them out of the stall. The female became very loud and argumentative with us.

'We managed to escort the female outside the club after Pruitt had arrested her for battery on a law enforcement officer.

'I was standing with Pruitt outside the club when the white male came out the side door and came right at us.

'I ordered the male to stand back, that we were in the middle of writing a police report. The male stated, "I don't care, that's my wife".

'I explained to the white male that if he continued with his conduct that he would be arrested for interfering.

'The male again stated, "I don't care" and came at both Pruitt and myself. These actions caused Pruitt to stop what he was doing and assist me in detaining the male suspect.

'I placed the white male under arrest at this time for interfering.'

The couple were taken to police premises to be booked and photographed, before being freed.

Humble: The pair both came from relatively humble backgrounds and are multi-millionaires in their own right

Mary was required to pay just over £1000 and her husband around £300, and they were then allowed to return to Scotland.

The Roxy Club is where golf star Tiger Woods allegedly picked up one of several women he had affairs with.

Cocktail waitress Julie Postle, 20, was working in the club's VIP section, when she met him in 2004.
