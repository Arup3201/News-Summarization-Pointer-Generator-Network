The man suspected of strangling his lover before throwing her body into a river wrote a note to her teenage daughter telling her: 'Stay here, I've gone to look for mum', before killing himself, police believe.

John Didier, 41, is believed to have murdered Annette Creegan, 49, on the Norfolk Broads while the couple were on a boating holiday with her 13-year-old daughter.

Now it has emerged that the American scribbled a note to the girl while she was asleep before deliberately drowning himself or dying in an accident.

It is believed the girl found the note when she woke up and waited on board for several days, hoping that her mother, a 'devoted' hospice nurse, and her boyfriend would return.

Holidaymaker: John Didier strangled Annette Creegan on board a Norfolk Broads pleasure cruiser

Investigation: John Didier, who has family links in the U.S. state of Arkansas but lived with Annette Creegan in Surrey, worked for the National Health Service in an unspecified role

She was found alone on board the rented 38ft boat that witnesses said had been tethered to a tree at an isolated spot for an entire week.

The bodies of Didier and Ms Creegan
 were found in the River Bure, near Wroxham, on Sunday.

Ms Creegan, of Mitcham, Surrey, 
worked as a community nurse treating dying people in their homes for the
 Trinity Hospice charity in South West London.

Chief executive Anne Hooper said she 
was ‘a truly wonderful and well-respected’ member of the care team, 
adding: ‘She was devoted to improving the lives of her patients.’

A neighbour of Ms Creegan’s said 
she had lived alone with her daughter until just 
over two years ago when Didier, from Phoenix, Arizona, arrived.

He had been working as an IT analyst at the St Charles’ Hospital in Kensington but left the job to go travelling.

The neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘John was almost always indoors.

Aftermath: Police examine the couple's rented boat, which was found tied up on the Norfolk Broads

Clues: Detectives investigating the deaths of a couple on the Norfolk Broads took a large amount of evidence from the boat where Didier spent a week after killing his partner

Investigation: Police are believed to have removed a blood stained sheet, lengths of cable and cable ties from the boat discovered tied up to a tree last September

‘While Annette went out to work, and paid for and did all the shopping, he never did. She did everything for him.’

Among items removed from the boat by police were a bloodstained sheet and lengths of rope and cable.

Detectives confirmed that Ms Creegan’s death was being treated as a strangling while Didier’s death was not suspicious.

A spokesman said: ‘We believe the deaths were a result of a domestic incident.’

Police searched Ms Creegan's home last night and removed computers and boxes from the property.

Two officers stood guard in front of the two-story end terrace house about 5.30pm as forensic team members loaded the items into a nearby car.

Probe: Police also searched Ms Creegan's home in Mitcham, Surrey, as part of the investigation

Evidence: Forensic officers removed computers and boxes from the end-terrace property

A neighbour, who would give her name only as Jo, said Ms Creegan 'idolised' her daughter.

'She was a lovely lady - she’s lived here about 15 years now,' the woman said. 'Her daughter is being cared for by family. They’re devastated.

'I didn’t know she was going away. When I saw the police outside I thought it was a burglary.

'Annette was really lovely, really nice. She idolised her daughter and they were always together.

'A friend told me the news and I was devastated. I can’t believe it - it’s really sad.

'I think she worked in the care profession as a nurse or something but I’m not sure.'

Michael Sek, 35, who moved in next 
door to Ms Creegan’s house a month ago, said he was 'a little shocked' 
when he heard his neighbour had been killed.

Earlier, it emerged that officers 
telephoned local guest houses and hotels in the Norfolk Broads to check 
if the couple had booked
in as they had found a 'lost' child.

But
 the bodies of the couple, who were both in their 40s, were later found 
in water near the boat on Sunday, which was moored in a secluded 
spot on the River Bure, near Wroxham.

Police are still trying to establish how
 long the girl had been on board the vessel after they today revealed 
she may have 'sat there traumatised for days'.

Det Supt Jes Fry, of the Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team, said: ‘We are building a time line of events that we will put together in a file for the inquest.

‘But I was trying to allay people's fears that she hadn't been in that situation for weeks or whatever.

‘She has given an account and we will build on that to establish a time line.

‘Obviously there are concerns from the public as to the welfare of this young girl. And that is our paramount concern.

‘We are providing support for her and the welfare of her family.’

Mystery: Police guard the scene on the Norfolk Broads between Wroxham and Salhouse where the pleasure boat was found

Jacqueline Brown, an employee at the 18th century Regency guest house in
 Neatishead, Norfolk, confirmed that officers had called her at 9pm on 
Saturday to ask if she had seen 'a couple'.

She said: 'They just said they had a lost child and they were looking 
for the parents who they thought might have checked into a local B & 
B.'

Officers said the girl was being 
looked after by family in Norfolk.

Some
 reports suggest the boat had been moored at the same spot for most of 
the week with the curtains closed and few signs of life on deck.

But others reported seeing the family enjoying a barbecue on board on Friday night.

Det Supt Fry refused to 
comment on reports that the mother had been 
dead for several days.

But it is understood that the girl, 
who was found alone on board the family’s rental boat, was 
cared for and fed throughout last week.

Remote: Locals described the banks along the section of the River Bure as inaccessible

An ice cream seller said yesterday 
that he had seen the 38ft £1,000-a-week boat tied to a tree several 
times since the previous Sunday.

He became so worried that he 
approached the craft but said a man on board angrily waved him away, 
apparently wanting to be left alone.

The alarm about the boat was only 
raised when the hire company, Le Boat, realised it had not been returned
 as arranged on Saturday.

It was quickly found after a search that 
evening.

Police officers who searched the boat are understood to have 
retrieved duct tape, cable ties, a computer hard drive, a laptop, 
screws, brackets and lengths of cable.

The ice cream man, who has worked on the Broads for 
23 years, said the boat had been in the same place for ‘at least seven 
or eight days’.

After seeing no movement when passing 
the craft at the remote spot between Salhouse Broad and Wroxham Broad, 
near Hoveton, he became so concerned that he went up to it to check 
everyone was well.

The 49-year-old said: ‘I went up and 
down the river a few times to get a good look at it and it always had 
its curtains and windows closed even in the middle of the day.

‘On Tuesday at about 5.30pm I decided I
 would go and see if everything was OK because I was concerned for their
 safety as they’d been in the same place for a long time.

'I was about eight 
feet away and shouted over. The man came through in a hurry, from the 
toilet area to the main section.

‘He shouted back through the curtain 
something like, “Go away. I don’t want anything”, and he waved me away 
with his hand. I saw the boat in the same position every day after 
that.’

Steve Daniels, owner of Fineway Launch
 Hire, said that many passers-by had spotted the boat but didn’t think 
it was unusual.

He said: ‘It is a popular spot for fishing at this time 
of year and people often fish into the night then sometimes sleep in 
during the day.’

A spokesman for Le Boat 
said the family had hired craft through them for Norfolk Broads holidays
 on ‘several’ previous occasions.

A previous version of this article incorrectly reported that police had named the dead man as John Didier. In fact, police have not yet named the man and have not issued a photograph of him. The police did not reveal that the dead man was an American citizen. In fact, the officer confirmed during a briefing only that the man was a foreign national.

Didier and Ms Creegan hired the vessel from Le Boat, which operates across the UK and Europe with a fleet of 1,200 cruisers
