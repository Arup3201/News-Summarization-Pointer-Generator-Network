Third time lucky: German chancellor Angela Merkel has been named as the most powerful woman in the world by business magazine Forbes for the third year running

German chancellor Angela Merkel has been named as the most powerful woman in the world by business magazine Forbes for the third year running.

The Queen and JK Rowling are the only British women to appear in the top 100, in 40th and 93rd place respectively.

Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff is second in the list, and Melinda Gates, co-chairman of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is third in the list which, although international, is dominated by Americans.

The 10th annual ranking sees the Queen, who at 87 is the oldest on the list, drop 12 places from last year, while US first lady Michelle Obama who was number one in 2010, moved up three places from last year to fourth place.

According to Forbes, this year's index represents women who are pioneers in politics, business, media, humanitarian concerns, entertainment and the technology industry.

It also features a number of women who are listed due to their wealth, with all ranked by money, media presence and impact.

The top figures in the entertainment industry are Americans Beyonce Knowles in 17th place, Angelina Jolie in 37th, and Lady Gaga in 45th after dropping 31 places.

Mrs Merkel tops the list for the third year running and makes her eighth appearance on the list, while former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who was second last year, dropped down to fifth place.

leading multibillion-dollar companies, governing countries, shaping the
cultural fabric of our lives or spearheading humanitarian initiatives, 
collectively these women are changing the planet in profoundly powerful 
and dynamic ways.'
