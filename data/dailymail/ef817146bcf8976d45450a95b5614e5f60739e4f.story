Australian globetrotters will now be able to get their much-loved flat whites while travelling across the United States, with Starbucks finally adding the beverage to its menu.

While most bemoan the coffee-making abilities of Americans, the ABC put the coffee giant's version of the beloved hipster drink to the ultimate test by calling on radio announcer Red Symons to try out the new addition.

Symons is best known for his role as the prickly judge of Hey Hey It's Saturday's Red Faces and lead guitarist of rock bank Skyhooks.

The coffee giant's version of the beloved hipster drink was put to ultimate test by radio announcer Red Symons (pictured here with ABC journalist Ben Knight)

Along with journalist Ben Knight, Symons visited a Starbucks to Washington D.C. to get their hands on one of the first flat whites to be served on U.S. soil.

Symons - whose drink of choice is the flat white - told the national broadcaster he often had to coax American baristas through the process of making a good cup of joe.

'In order to get a decent coffee here you have to get a cup and you say "I'd like an espresso, and then can you put another espresso in that cup, and then can you pour some milk on top - no that's enough",' he said.

A Starbucks' flat white is made with 'steamed whole milk poured over two shots of espresso, topped with microfoam swirled into beautiful latte art', according to its website.

And it seems the cafe chain is on to something good but still has room for improvement.

In the initial first sips, Symons said the coffee was a bit weak for his liking but he was 'happy with the foam'.

He also questioned the lack of promised 'latte art'. 

'The important thing is, maybe it's not how coffee should be, but they're having a go,' he said.

For years, there has been much debate surrounding the origins of the flat white.

It has been reported the beverage first appeared in the early 1980s in Sydney but Melbournians have laid claim to creating the concoction, saying they were drinking them as early as the 1970s.

But over the ditch in New Zealand, Kiwi coffee makers credit themselves with the invention of the flat white we know today in the later 1980s, The New Zealand Herald reported.

Starbucks has started serving the flat white, which some say originated in Australia, in stores

While social media has been abuzz with the new drink options, Australians were less than enamored by the inclusion

Brisbane's Bec wrote: 'If starbucks u.s flat white attempt is similar to their "cappuccino" attempt, ill stick to black coffee while i am there'

While social media has been abuzz with the new drink options, Australians were less than enamored by the inclusion.

'So America is in a flap about the flat white. The really big deal is that Starbucks has found a new style of coffee to f**k up,' Melbourne's Tron Lord tweeted.

While Brisbane's Bec wrote: 'If starbucks u.s flat white attempt is similar to their "cappuccino" attempt, ill stick to black coffee while i am there'.

And for Americans, Starbucks' flat white is more of an acquired taste.

'The Starbucks Flat White is just a glass of warm milk,' Matt White said.

lisasharkey echoed his sentiments: 'The Starbucks Flat White is just a glass of warm milk.'
