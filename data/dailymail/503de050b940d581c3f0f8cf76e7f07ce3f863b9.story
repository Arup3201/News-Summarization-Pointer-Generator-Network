The people of the North East have a reputation for braving the cold without a coat – but this is ridiculous...

Heather Mills, who was raised in Tyne and Wear, shows off her incredible figure as she poses on an Alpine peak in just a swimsuit and ski boots to promote her appearance on winter sports reality show The Jump.

And in an exclusive interview with today’s Mail on Sunday Event magazine, the 47-year-old boasts: ‘I’m very sexy – there isn’t a part of my body I’m not happy with.’

The outspoken former model holds nothing back in the interview as she reveals the difficulties of living with former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, how it feels to be the dubbed ‘the most hated woman in Britain’ – and the bizarre moment her false leg fell off when she was on a ski lift.

‘I felt this “whoosh” from my trousers,’ she says. ‘Then there was a scream from behind with a kid shouting, “Her leg has dropped off!”

‘I was hopping around at the top of the lift and a snowboarder emerged carrying my leg shouting, “Whoa! Is this yours? That is so cool!” ’

Ms Mills lost her leg when she was knocked over by a police motorbike in 1993. 

But she says the amputation was ‘easier to cope with’ than her acrimonious 2008 divorce from Sir Paul. ‘When I woke up in hospital and was told I’d lost my leg I always knew I could cope,’ she says.

‘When I got married I thought I’d be protected, but I wasn’t, I was hung out to dry.

'It’s the worst thing I’ve ever gone through – and now I’m over it.’

Ms Mills says she has never regretted the marriage, as she had been ‘completely in love’ with Sir Paul – but warns ‘anyone who thinks marrying a rock legend is going to be paradise… it just isn’t’.

Trying to explain what went wrong, she says: ‘I say what I think. If I think something is wrong I’ll say it. 

'If I wasn’t that type of person we’d still be married now. 

'For years I was attracted to these very strong, powerful men who think they want a strong woman but actually they want someone who does what they want.’

Despite a hefty divorce settlement, Ms Mills insists she is not interested in money. 

She says she lives a simple life with Beatrice, her 11-year-old daughter with Sir Paul, flies economy and buys Topshop clothes.

And her appearance on The Jump, which starts on Channel 4 next Sunday, will showcase another side of her life – as a world-ranked Paralympic slalom skier. 

‘I wanted to do something I’d enjoy... something that would challenge me,’ she adds.
