First came the torrential weather, then the floods. Now residents living near the Somerset Levels say they are facing a new problem - a plague of mosquitoes.

The insects are are the latest blight on the flood-ravaged Somerset Levels.

One man has even been driven to invest in that staple of African exploration, the mosquito net, to get a good night’s sleep.

Jon Ryan says he has been forced to sleep with mosquito net after he was bitten between 30 and 40 times in one night

Jon Ryan lives at Godney where the flooded rivers Sheppey and Brue spread silt and rotting weed over hundreds of acres of land.

He is one of many bitten by the insects which have hatched in hordes.

He said: 'When we travel abroad to 
hot places we expect the occasional bite but this is exceptional. I woke
up one morning with 30-40 bites on my legs.

'We have tried various sprays but 
they don’t exactly do much for your breathing. A mosquito net over the 
bed at night was the answer and it’s proving effective.'

Nearby at Godney Farm beef and dairy 
farmer Michael Churches lives near 90 acres of land which could be the 
cause of Mr Ryan’s problem.

Mr Ryan said a mosquito net is the only way he can get a good night's sleep

He and eight other local farmers are 
among dozens across the Levels are still struggling to feed livestock as 
hundreds of acres lie covered in silt, tree trunks and rotting weed nine
weeks after floods first hit.

Mr Churches said: 'Some years ago they had a maintenance programme to desilt the rivers but it doesn’t happen now.

'The Sheppy and the Brue and Whitelake river, which is called the Division Rhine need to be dredged.

'They have trimmed the river, but they don’t desilt.

'The Environment Agency is financed by Defra and they say they haven’t been given the money.

'We know the land will flood but unless the rivers are desilted the water can’t be carried away quickly enough.

'Now we’ve got a thick black carpet of silt and debris.

'There are millions of mosquitoes and they carry disease such as Blue Tongue.

Flooding in the Somerset Levels, which includes the River Sheppey (pictured) has led to conditions described as an 'ecological disaster'

'In the past we have been highly 
commended in the Beautiful Farm awards and our land is really rich in 
wildlife species but they have been destroyed.'

Bridgwater and West Somerset MP Ian 
Liddell-Grainger said the Department for Food, the Environment and Rural
Affairs had created an ecological disaster.

He said Defra should fund Environment
Agency dredging of rivers and he called for machines currently at work 
on a £29 million scheme to create major new intertidal wetland for 
wildlife on the Bristol Channel coast, and protect the hamlet of Steart 
to be diverted to the Levels.

He claimed Richard Benyon, Minister 
for the Natural Environment, had done nothing to help farmers and called
on him to wake up and smell the problem.

An Environment Agency spokesman said:

'Mosquito numbers fluctuate naturally year on year for a variety of reasons, such as temperature. Anecdotal evidence suggests the number of mosquitoes on the Somerset Levels has increased this year.

'Environment Agency teams are working to remove all the remaing flood water from the Somerset Levels, and expect pumping operations to be complete by the end of the week. 

'We spend some £20 million annually on dredging in England and Wales. In many cases, however, dredging will not reduce the risk of flooding, simply because many rivers quickly silt up again as part of their natural processes. We therefore focus our efforts on dredging at those locations where it has a proven benefit of reducing flood risk.'

A Defra spokesman said: 'We are 
spending more than £2.1 billion on flood risk management, and are on 
course to exceed our goal to better protect 145,000 homes by March 2015.

'The Environment Agency has pumped 11
million cubic metres of water from the moors near the towns of Taunton 
and Bridgwater this year alone.

'We are doing all we can to keep the 
rivers in Somerset clear but dredging does not reduce the risk of 
flooding because rivers quickly silt up again naturally.'

A coalition of farmers, 
environmentalists and local authorities has been set up to address the 
problems faced on the Somerset Levels.

Anthony Gibson, who is heading up the
coalition in his role as chairman of Somerset Water Management 
Partnership, said: 'This must serve as a wake-up call to all concerned 
as to the damage which is caused if sufficient resources are not made 
available to manage water on the one hand, and to maintain the delicate 
balance between farming and wildlife on the other.'
