A daredevil who drowned taking close-up pictures of a whirlpool had posted a similar video of the tidal phenomenon online days before he died.

Jacob Cockle's clips of the vortexes from around the world have been viewed on YouTube more than two million times.

But the thrillseeker died after attempting to get 'just one more photograph' of a whirlpool in Carnsew Pool in the Hayle Estuary, Cornwall.

Tragic death: Jacob Cockle, 28, drowned while attempting to get close to a whirlpool

The disused man-made waterway was constructed by the Victorians in 1830 and was originally built to flush sand from the harbour.

Although onlookers raised the alarm, Jacob, 28, was airlifted to hospital and pronounced dead on Tuesday night.

The photographer had posted a close-up film of a whirlpool in Norway online less than a week before he died.

And in another video he is seen swimming in one of the vortexes. It is unclear where the clip, posted in January, was filmed.

Lee
Harvey, 35, a close friend of him for 20 years, said Jacob, of 
Penzance, Cornwall, was taking still photographs while his friend filmed
him when tragedy struck.

'Jacob was one of the friendliest, happiest and loving person you could ever meet. It is very hard to take,' he said.

'Jacob is a body boarder although he 
loved surfing and would also do that, he also loved filming whirlpools, 
which is what I believe happened.Â 

'He went to the pools with a guy who 
he goes out there with - he isn't reckless. Jacob said he was going back
for just one more photo.

'But then the guy lost sight of him and he went towards the centre of the whirlpools.

'The next thing he came out the other side and was unconscious. It is just such a tragedy and so hard to take.'

Jacob's mother Carolyn Sheard, 58, 
said yesterday: 'All I can say is imagine if it was your child, we are 
obviously absolutely devastated.

'He was a friend of everybody, he had 
so many friends and he held no grudges against any person at all. He 
lived life to the full.'

In December 2008 Jacob, of Hayle, cheated death while surfing after becoming trapped between a stone pier and a freak 30ft wave.

He clung to his board and was thrown into the air 'like a rag doll' as it broke over him at Newlyn, near Penzance in Cornwall.

The daredevil also caught his fair share of dramatic scrapes from behind the lens.

In January 2011 he captured two surfers being swept off a sea wall by 30ft waves - and hurled into the sea 15ft below.

The pair were playing around at the 
water's edge in Mousehole, Cornwall, during stormy weather as breakers 
lashed the coastline, where Jacob was looking for surfers to picture

As a giant wave crashed over the 
harbour wall, the pair were unexpectedly knocked off their feet before 
being hurled into the frothy raging torrent below.

Jacob said at the time: 'I couldn't 
believe what I was seeing. It was so dangerous. They disappeared and in a
matter of seconds were swirling around the water below.

'It could have been so much worse had they hit their head on a rock or something.'
