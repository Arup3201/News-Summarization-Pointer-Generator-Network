A new £30million academy has opened directly opposite a seedy sex club, complete with leather-clad clientele, a mock torture wheel and a fully-equipped dungeon.

North Durham Academy, which opened this month in Stanley, county Durham, boasts of its state-of-the-art design, with classrooms kitted out with projectors, interactive whiteboards and brand new science labs.

But its prospectus fails to mention the business just opposite - Clubf - which describes itself as the best sex club in the north east.

The club, which appears from the outside to be 'The Spa Hotel' was subject to vigorous resistance from local residence when its true intentions became apparent in 2004.

The addition of a school just cross the road has intensified the protests.

The website - which does not openly disclose the club's location - lists the club's facilities, including a dance floor complete with pole, a sauna and steam room, a 'public play area'.

The underground dungeon is also shown, featuring leather and chains, padded tables and a man-sized wheel to which guests can be strapped.

The club, which opens from 8pm most evenings, urges its visitors to be discreet, but locals still campaign against the establishment, which they say is 'unsuitable' for the location, and creates disturbances.

Ann Hilde, a member of a local residents' campaign, said said: 'From day one we feared this would happen. What started out as an event on a Saturday night at the spa has become a series of party nights on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.

State-of-the-art: Clubf is just around the corner from the £30million North Durham Academy

Unassuming: Clubf does not openly display itself, and urges customer to be discreet

'There are problems with cars parking in the area and visitors leaving in the early hours of the morning are causing a noise disturbance.

When the windows are open I can hear all sorts.'

Retired factory worker, 66-year-old grandmother Edith Errington, has lived nearby for the past 26 years has noted the exotic visitors to the site.

She said: 'Sometimes the people are dressed up in skirts up to here, both men and women, or PVC or as tarts and vicars but other times you just see them carrying a plastic bag in with them.

Campign: John and Edith Errington have said that Clubf's presence is 'unsuitable' in light of the new academy

'Some of them look sheepish but others aren’t bothered. You hear all kinds of stories.'

Her husband John said: 'It should be shifted. It is one thing if it is on a trading estate in the middle of nowhere, but it shouldn’t be right next to people’s homes, on a high street and opposite a school.'

The club has made efforts to downplay the disruption it causes - members must pay a subscription fee and be over 25, and the website asks visitors to 'appreciate we wish to stay at the club for the long term and not everyone is as open minded as we all are.'

The premesis needs no special license, as it does not sell alcohol and also the services it offers do not classify as 'sexual entertainment' - which means the police and council have no reason to intervene.

A spokesman for Durham County Council said: 'We are not aware of licensing issues surrounding this premises. It doesn’t have an alcohol license or a sexual entertainment licence that we are aware of.'

A spokeswoman from Durham Police said: 'It’s a hotel with themed rooms, bring your own booze policy so it does not need a licence under the licensing act.

'The county council licensing enforcement people visit regularly to ensure compliance and it fully complies with current legislation.'

Nobody wished to comment from the club.

A spokeswoman for North Durham Academy said they did not wish to comment.
