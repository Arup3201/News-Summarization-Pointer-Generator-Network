The Attorney General has ordered the Crown Prosecution Service to investigate whether a website in support of Ched Evans has committed criminal offences in relation to identifying the rape victim.

Jeremy Wright QC has also asked North Wales police to look into whether material served during the court case in 2012 has been dealt with 'properly'.

Evans was released from prison last year after serving two-and-a-half years for the rape of a 19-year-old woman in a hotel, but continues to protest his innocence.

A spokeswoman for the Attorney General said: 'The Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC MP, has asked the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether any criminal offences may have been committed in regards to identifying the victim in the Ched Evans case.

'He has also asked the North Wales police to investigate whether some of the material served during the course of the proceedings has been dealt with properly.

'If not, this may constitute a contempt of court.

'Given that there is now the possibility of proceedings being brought, it is very important that there is no comment in the media which might jeopardise either the investigation or any subsequent proceedings.'
