Bridesmaid: Laura Rees, 23, died in a car crash on her way to visit a friend who was getting married

A bridesmaid was killed in a car crash as she went to visit the bride-to-be on the day she went to be fitted for her dress, in inquest has heard.

Nursery worker Laura Rees died in the head-on collision in South Wales just hours after she had picked up her dress and got her nails done ahead of her friend's big day.

The 23-year-old, who was buried in her bridesmaid dress, was due to spend the night at the bride's house to discuss plans for the wedding.

A statement from Miss Rees's mother Angela was read out last Friday at the inquest into her death at Llanelli Town Hall in Carmarthenshire.

She told police her daughter had enjoyed a 'leisurely "me" day' before her death in October last year.

Mrs Rees added: 'She was so excited about the wedding and had just had a fitting for the dress - that dress was the dress she was buried in.'

The inquest heard that the bridesmaid was driving on the A40 near Whitland when she was involved in the two-car crash.

'We will never know what happened that night on that stretch of road,' Miss Rees's mother said as she described her daughter's commitment to her nursery work.

'Laura loved working,' Mrs Rees said in her statement. 'She would often not have a drink just in case she was needed to drive.

'She loved working with children - she had applied to go back university in 2013 to study midwifery.

'I never saw her take risks or exceed the speed limit.'

Miss Rees was vigilant in forcing passengers in her car to wear a seat belt, the inquest heard.

Carmarthenshire coroner Mark Layton ruled that the death of the nursery worker, who lived in St Clears, was an accident.

He concluded: 'Laura Mary Anne Rees was a talented young woman and on a return journey, she lost control of the car.'
