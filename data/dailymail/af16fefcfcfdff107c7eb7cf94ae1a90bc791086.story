A full-size granite Stonehenge replica has gone on the market on an Australian farm and it will set you back $5 million.

The replica was built on a 430 hectare property in Esperance, 700km south-east of Perth, three years ago and was carved to look exactly like the UK Stonehenge as it would have in 1950 BC.

The Stonehenge replica and a three-bedroom house are included in the $5 million price tag, which has become a tourist attraction of sorts in the West Australian town.

The full-size granite Stonehenge replica has gone on the market on an Australian farm for $5 million.

The whole Stonehenge concept started three years ago when a man just decided he wanted to replicate the piece of history

'The whole concept started when a gentleman decide he wanted to replicate the Stonehenge,' Rob Johnstone from Elders Real Estate told Daily Mail Australia.

'The financial crisis came along and that didn't turn out for that man.

'All the stones had been cut but had no where to go.'

But the man's neighbour put his hand up to buy the stones and build the replica on his property right next door.

The property was recently listed for sale and is being heavily marketed on the farm's unique Stonehenge addition.

It has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a homestead, workshop and plenty of room for cattle, according to Mr Johnstone.

The property also boasts a combined ocean and rural landscape setting.
