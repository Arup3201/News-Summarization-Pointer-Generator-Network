For most of us karate chopping the air like Bruce Lee is but a dream, but for one 11-year-old from California, his martial arts proficiency has won him the legend's accolade.

Nick-named 'mini Bruce Lee' on YouTube after the Jeet Kune Do master, young Noah Fort performs a range of moves so fast it's hard to keep up.

The youngster can be seen slashing a 'bō' - a stick that was used as a weapon in Japan - through the air with the skill of a true Bruce Lee disciple.

Lee was born in Chinatown, San Francisco, but moved to his parents' birth country Hong Kong when he was three months old where he was raised until he was 18.

He studied martial arts to fend off bullies at school and despite developing an enviable physique in later years, he was known as a weedy teenager, cementing himself as an idol for the weak and defenceless everywhere.

After moving back to America Lee appeared in several martial arts films in the seventies including Fist of Fury and Way of the Dragon.
