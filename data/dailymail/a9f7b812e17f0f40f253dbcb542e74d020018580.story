Children whose mothers work during their early years do not fare worse at school, according to comprehensive new research.

The study found no link between mothers who continue their careers and children performing less well academically – debunking a common parenting myth.

The research analysed six different studies over the past four decades looking at around 40,000 children.

The report attributed the academic improvement in children with working mothers to better childcare

It showed that children born since the mid-90s whose mothers worked during their early years fared just as well as those whose mothers did not.

However, those born to career mothers in the 1970s, 80s and early 90s did suffer a disadvantage, according to the research.

Children born in 2000 or 2001 showed no significant difference in cognitive ability or behaviour at the age of five whether their mothers had gone out to work or not in their first year.

Studies of previous decades showed children’s literacy and numeracy levels were around two percentage points lower when mothers worked.

Parenting groups said the report should ‘put an end to some of the emotional baggage’ for mothers deciding whether or not to return to work.

Fiona Weir, chief executive of the single-parent charity Gingerbread, said: ‘It’s clear that the changes in maternity leave and greater availability of childcare have played a big role in enabling parents to balance work and family.

The report comes as Parliament debates proposals to cut the ratio of childcare workers to children

‘However, for single parents in particular, the crippling cost of childcare and a shortage of family-friendly jobs are making it very difficult for those who do want to return to work.’

The report’s authors attributed the improvement in the academic performances of children with working mothers to the expansion of childcare in the 1990s. 

Professor Heather Joshi, of the University of London’s Centre for Longitudinal Studies, told the Independent: ‘There has traditionally been a concern that the employment of mothers comes at the expense of child development.

‘But as the percentage of mothers in work has gone up, any impact on children has diminished.

‘The most obvious thing that changed in the 90s was the New Labour government, which started taking childcare seriously as an area of public concern.

‘In the 80s, childcare was either something that only very rich families could purchase or very poor families got offered because their child was at risk, so everyone else in the middle had to make do with informal arrangements.’

The report comes as Parliament debates controversial proposals to cut the ratio of childcare workers to children.

And Prof Joshi warned the proposals could reverse the progress evidenced in the report.

She added: ‘This wouldn’t have happened without a big expansion of childcare and if anything happens to funds available for childcare, there may be consequences.’

Sharon Hodgson, shadow children's minister, said the research demonstrated the ‘great strides’ Labour made in raising the quality of childcare.

She added: ‘The Government’s plans to cut the number of staff needed to look after children risk putting those improvements into reverse.’

The research will be presented in central London today at a Campaign for Social Science event on longitudinal studies attended by universities and science minister, David Willetts.

On the proposed childcare reforms, a Department for Education spokeswoman said: ‘Parents want to be able to go out to work confident in the knowledge that their children are being well looked after.

‘Quality is central to our childcare reforms which will give parents more choice and ensure their young children have the best start in life.’
