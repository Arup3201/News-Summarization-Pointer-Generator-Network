He directed the film versions of Simon adaptations 'The Odd Couple,' 'Barefoot in the Park,' 'Last of the Red Hot Lovers' and 'Brighton Beach Memoirs.'

He also directed the stage and film version of 'Mame,' which starred his then-wife Bea Arthur. Saks directed Goldie Hawn to an Oscar for supporting actress in 'Cactus Flower.'

'He could direct actors to be funny, but he wasn’t funny himself,' Emanuel Azenberg, who produced nine Broadway shows directed by Saks, told the New York Times. 'He would say, "This is funny," in a very serious way. And you’d laugh, because that was funny. 

'All of those fundamentals - pacing, timing, line readings - that had to do with: If you said it this way it would be funny, but if you said it another way it wouldn’t be funny. That’s what he was good at,' Azenberg added.

Saks is survived by his wife Keren, their daughter, and his two adopted sons from his first marriage to Golden Girls star Bea Arthur. Saks and Arthur. Saks and Arthur were married for thirty years before divorcing in 1980. She passed away in 2009.
