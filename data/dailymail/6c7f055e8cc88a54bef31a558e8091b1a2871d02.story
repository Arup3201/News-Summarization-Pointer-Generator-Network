Thanks for joining us guys. It took a while but it was worth it. A quick recap of the highlights for you: 

Freddie Roach (Pacquiao's trainer): 'We are in the toughest fight of our lives, we are fighting the best fighter in the world... but we are going to kick his ass.'Manny Pacquiao: 'For the fans of boxing, I believe, this is what you are waiting for since five years ago. Both of us are going to undergo hard training for this fight and we will do our best on May 2 to make you happy.'Floyd Mayweather: 'This is a fight the world can't miss, it is an unbelievable match-up. I'm in the gym working right now, dedicating myself to the sport because I've never wanted to win a fight so much in my life.'

So, the boxers won't square up until the weigh-in on May 1 in Las Vegas. 

Until then stayed tuned as Sporstmail will bring you all the latest news, pictures and videos as we gear up to the biggest fight in boxing history.

See you all soon.

The fighters stand up and talk to their respective teams and step off stage. But no handshake between the two at the moment.

Mayweather: 'First off, I have to thank my father. Unbelievable trainer, unbelievable person. 

'It has been a long road but we are here now. Al Haymon - remarkable guy.

'May 2 - the fight of the century. It is all about the best fighting the best and Pacquiao is one of the best fighters of this era. It is all about timing and we couldn't choose a better time.

'Our game plan is to be smart and take one fight at a time - like all 47 fights.'

'This is a fight the world can't miss, it is an unbelievable match-up. I'm in the gym working right now, dedicating myself to the sport because I've never wanted to win a fight so much in my life.

'One thing I do know about any sport, when you lose it is in your mind. If you've lost once it is in your mind. If you've lost once, it is your mind. If you've lost twice, it is in your mind. From day one I've been taught to be a winner.'

Pacquiao: 'I'd like to thank God for providing us a wonderful day and giving us strength. 

'For the fans of boxing, I believe, this is what you are waiting for since five years ago. Both of us are going to undergo hard training for this fight and we will do our best on May 2 to make you happy. 

'I want to let the people know that God can raise someone from nothing to something - and that is me. I came from nothing to something and I owe everything to God. 

' I want to thank all the Flippino fans who are watching at home. I want to thank Freddie Roach for being very nice to me and Bob Arum. We have been working since 2001 and we have loyalty and are the longest working pair in boxing. '

Freddie Roach: 'This is the biggest challenge of my life and I've been looking forward to this for a long time. We are in the toughest fight of our lives, we are fighting the best fighter in the world... but we are going to kick his ass.'

Bob Arum and Stephen Espinoza joking about who is the biggest draw in boxing. 

Espinoza: 'Mayweather is the No 1 pay-per-view-draw in boxing'

Arum: 'Everybody has there own opinion, Steven'

The man who signed the £200m six-deal Show Time fight with Mayweather, says: 'Floyd is fighting an opponent many thought he would never fight.' 

Stephen Espinoza says Tyson-Lewis, Mayweather-Canelo did not generate anywhere near the excitement that Mayweather-Pacquiao has done so far.

He says that Pacquiao has been always been high on Mayweather's list and that the first fight didn't happen in 2009 because of the infamous drug-testing clause. 

Bob Arum talking about the importance of this fight - which he says the whole world will be watching. He says 'it is a credit to the sport of boxing' that this fight is happening. 

A lot of back-patting between here as everyone congratulates each other on getting this fight done. 

And the official time is in: 38 seconds Mayweather and Pacquiao stood face-to-face.

 

Mayweather now walking on to the stage to join Pacquiao... and he's walking out to 'We Will Rock You'

It is Pacquiao to come first on to the stage...

Ladies and Gentleman, boys and girls, let's get ready to rumble. After all the talk and hype, finally the two fighters are about to come on stage. 

Apparently, Mayweather made £2,500 in his first pro-fight when he beat Roberto Apodaca. On May 2 he will earn a little bit more than that. No wonder he is smiling...

The reel of highlights continues, with the audience now treated to Pacquiao's dominant performance against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 - a fight that turned Pacquiao into a superstar. 

Ok, now we are back to Mayweather and his unanimous points win over Juan Manual Marques back in 2009.  The Money man knocked down his opponent in the second round and dominated the fight from start to end. 

Ok, now it is the turn to relive one of Pacquiao's greatest moments. His destruction of Miguel Cotto in 2009. 

As we wait for the fighters, we are treated to re-run of Mayweather's 2001 fight with Diego Corrales and specifically the seventh round, when Floyd knocked down his opponent three times in a fight he would go to win with a TKO in round 10. 

Ken Hersham, the head of HBO, who will also be showing the fight in the States, says this fight will 'transcend boxing' and that May 2 'will be very special' and worth the wait. 

Let's hope so...

Stephen Espinoza, the head of Show Time, who will be showing the fight in the States, says he knew the fight would happen when Mayweather and Pacquaio meet at the Miami Heat basketball game and cleared the air. 

As we get nearer to the press conference kicking off, tension in the arena in L.A is growing. The pair's previous fights are being shown to the audience. Stayed tuned as we wait for the boxers to get on the stage.  

AS we gear up for the press conference - which is about to start in a matter of minutes - the red carpet is packed with media, fans and boxing lovers all wanting a piece of Mayweather and Pacquiao. 

Away from the two star turns, we have some pretty famous boxing faces in attendence - including ring announcers Michael Buffer (left) and Jimmy Lennon

Mayweather is a veteran at these promotional days and is clearly in his element, laughing and joking as he poses for pictures on the red carpet. 

Not to be out done by Pacquiao, Mayweather has showed up in an equally dapper grey suit. Although the pound-for-pound king has opted to leave the tie at home. 

Mayweather and his entourage - including two pretty imposing bodyguards - have arrived in Los Angeles for this first and only press conference ahead of the May 2 fight. 

Stay tuned as the fights are due to come face to face in the next half an hour (if everything runs on time)

And the man of the moment, Mr Floyd Mayweather has arrived in Los Angeles. 

As we wait for Mayweather to make his arrival, here is Pacquiao on why him winning the $300m mega-fight would be 'good for boxing'. READ the full story here. 

Do you agree? 

 

We've got less than 45 minutes until Pacquiao and Mayweather square off... but there is no sign of the pound-for-pound king yet. Stayed tuned because as soon as he shows up, you'll hear it here first.  

Pacquiao, Arum and Roach are deep in discussion on the red carpet. I wonder if Arum is asking over Pacquiao and Roach plan to stop the undefeated Mayweather on May 2?

Pacquiao, as is his way, looks relaxed and calm. May be because his training seems to be going so well. 

The 36-year-old has been keeping his fans up to date with his progress. Watch his latest video here. 

Pacquiao has certainly made the effort for today - shades and all!

Pacquiao and Roach have been full of confidence ahead of the May 2 fight - maybe it is because they've got a secret sparring partner from Floyd's camp - and they certainly look relaxed as they pose for pictures. 

First to arrive is Manny Pacquiao, accompanied by his hall of fame trainer Freddie Roach and promoter Bob Arum. 

And isn't Manny - in his crisp dark suit and purple tie - looking the part. 

Evening all and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of the first - and only - press conference between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquaio. 

We're due to get underway at 8.30 UK time but excitement is already building ahead of what should be an explosive day in Los Angeles.
