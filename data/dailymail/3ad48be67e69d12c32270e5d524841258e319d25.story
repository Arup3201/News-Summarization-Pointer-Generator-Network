Crank: A police mugshot shows Andrew Frey, who is accused of masturbating in a bar, resisting arrest and theft. The Beaverton, Oregon man later claimed he'd been using methamphetamine

An Oregon man was arrested for masturbating in a bar Sunday and it took 15 officers to finally haul him in.

Andrew Frey was Tasered to no effect by Marion County Sheriffs after employees at Iggy's Bar and Grill in Salem called to complain he was rubbing them the wrong way.

The 37-year-old apparently later came to, at which point he admitted to authorities he'd been using methamphetamine and had no recollection of his crazed behavior.

According to Oregon Live, Frey began acting strangley well before he made it inside Iggy's.

Around 1pm on Sunday, Frey called a locksmith but then allegedly refused to pay him for services rendered.

Authorities
 say Frey then wandered to a nearby convenience store and refused to 
leave until an employee escorted him off the premises.

That's when Frey entered Iggy's.

According to bartender, Frey began masturbating at the bar.

By the time police officers showed up, Frey had moved to the restroom for some privacy.

Frey allegedly resisted arrest, at which point cops tried to stun him into submission with a Taser.

It only served to enrage him, however, as police say he then began fighting with officers.

By the time Frey was hauled away, 15 officers from three jurisdictions had arrived to the scene to subdue him.

Frey now faces charges of public indecency, resisting arrest and theft.

Inconvenience: Frey allegedly first wandered into this Salem, Oregon convenience store after police say he stiffed a locksmith for services rendered. He was escorted from the premises by an employee

From the store, cops say Frey wandered here, to Iggy's Bar and Grill, where employees called the police to complain he was masturbating first at the bar and later in the bathroom. It took 15 officers to haul him out
