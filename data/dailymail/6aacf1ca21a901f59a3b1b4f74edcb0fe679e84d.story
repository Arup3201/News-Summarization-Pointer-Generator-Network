Millie Mackintosh is a walking advert for a healthy lifestyle - just one look at her Instagram feed confirms she is a huge advocate of work-outs and superfoods.

The former Made In Chelsea star is so into exercise that she works out up to six times a week and is addicted to Xbox Fitness - an interactive fitness app with celebrity personal 
trainers.

Speaking to MailOnline, Millie said: 'I exercise about four to six times per week. 
This is more than I used to as my Xbox has helped me as there would be 
no way that I could get to the gym this often.

Never off duty: Millie even wears her gym kit on her days off to stay in a healthy mindset

'Jillian Michaels is an inspiring trainer who makes me want to get ripped like her. I try to wear my gym kit when I have a day off to help me stay in a healthy mindset.'

Millie is also a huge fan of Tracy Anderson, who
is credited with honing the bodies of Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow.

She said: 'Her workouts really challenge my coordination - it's great that I can do them at home so nobody can see me wobbling around!

'I am going to take up weekly yoga in 2014 so I will be sure to use her workouts then. I am also planning on meditating more and trying to learn a new skill.'

As well as her passion for exercise, Millie follows a healthy diet regime, too. She loves green juice and is an avid fan of James Duigan's Clean and Lean plan, as well as the Honestly Healthy alkaline-based diet.

Speaking about juicing, the 24-year-old said: 'Cleansing is about general well being and health rather than losing weight. There are so many additional benefits for skin and energy too.'

And it seems her healthy lifestyle has been rubbing off on husband Professor Green. 'I've been making us healthy packed 
lunched recently with loads of protein and vegetables,' she said.

Treat day: Millie says she loves a treat day and Stephen makes the best roast potatoes

But, proving that she is human, Millie has treat days just like us. She said: 'I love a treat day. My favourite things are homemade chocolate brownies, a pizza from Pizza East or a dirty martini.

Stephen makes a great 
roast. His potatoes are the best.'

Millie, a former make-up artist who always manages looks flawless, revealed her top winter beauty tips as microdermabrasion facials, lots of water, a night-time hydrating face mask, body brushing for lymphatic drainage and argan oil for her hair and body.

Despite leaving BAFTA winning Made In Chelsea last year, it seems that Millie is keen to get back on the our TV screens.

Speaking about her future plans, the confectionery heiress revealed: 'I have a new TV project this year and I'm going to be expanding my product range.'

She may have trained as a make-up artist herself but Millie Mackintosh has called on Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne's favourite make-up artist to give her a 60s-style makeover.

Charlotte Tilbury, who is a fashion week and celebrity favourite, has transformed Millie into her icon: Brigitte Bardot. 

The video coincides with the launch of Charlotte’s limited edition Lip Lustre shade in Bardot Beige.
