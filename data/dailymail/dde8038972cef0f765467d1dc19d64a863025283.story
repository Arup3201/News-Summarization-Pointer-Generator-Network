A trainee beautician who is blind in one eye had half of her ponytail hacked off after two boys ran up behind her and hacked at her ponytail with scissors.

Emily Wilding, 17, from Northwich, Cheshire, was walking home along a main road at around 5pm after finishing work at a restaurant when the boys ran up behind her.

One of them used a pair of scissors to hack at her hair, which was tied in a ponytail, before fleeing into a nearby park.

Trainee beautician Emily Wilding, 17, who is also blind in one eye, was attacked as she walked home from her job at a restaurant in Northwich, Cheshire, by two boys who cut her hair with scissors

Mother Karen Wilding said: 'Emily came home and was panicking saying "mum I think somebody has just cut my hair" and I said "don’t be silly".

'But when I looked a huge chunk came away in my hand. She was devastated. Her hair means so much to her and she’s really conscious of the length of it. She’s always asking me to look at it.

According to police Miss Wilding saw the boys, who were wearing hoodies, approach from behind before hearing a snipping sound as they passed her

'I told her it could have been much worse though because she is blind in one eye already and if she had turned they could have had her other eye and she could have lost her sight completely.

'It has just completely knocked her confidence she’s been on a definite downer since it happened and she just doesn’t want to leave the house.

'She’s training to be a beautician at Hartford College and in that line of work they say that your appearance is everything so this has really knocked her.'

Emily lives just five minute's walk along main roads from her workplace in Northwich town centre, but this is not the first time she has been approached on her way home. 

Her mother added that just last year police were called after a man approached her and asked her to go with him, before also running away.

Since the latest attack the family have been supported by the local community, with a local hairdresser giving her a free haircut and extensions.

Police have appealed for anyone who might have witnessed the incident, which happened last Tuesday, or have information on the two attackers, to come forward.

A spokesman for Cheshire Constabulary said: 'The victim was walking along Castle Street when two males approached her from behind.

'As they went past her she heard a snipping noise and later discovered that some of her hair had been cut out.

According to Miss Wilding's mother the attack has left her daughter's confidence badly shattered, so she has been given free extensions and a haircut at a local beauty salon

'One was described as wearing a grey tracksuit with white trainers, the other one was wearing a blue tracksuit with black trainers.

'Both men are white and under five foot tall, and had their hoods pulled up at the time of the attack.' 

Officers say there is no indication at this stage that Miss Wilding knew either of the attackers. 

Anyone with information is asked to contact Cheshire Constabulary on 101.
