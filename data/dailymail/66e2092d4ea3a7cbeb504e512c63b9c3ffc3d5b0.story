Most people like to take a back seat 
after retiring, but passionate pilot Gordon Jones is still climbing into
the cockpit having just celebrated his 90th birthday.

The great grandfather is one of the world's oldest pilots and first started flying in a Tiger Moth as a Canadian Air Force recruit in August 1941 aged 18.

In 1992, Mr Jones brought his own 
Tiger Moth for £30,000 and remarkably later found out he had flown the
same plane 10 times before during his service.

Flying in the face of age: Gordon Jones is 90 but still climbing into the cockpit of his beloved Tiger Moth

Veteran: Mr Jones, left aged 90 and right in 1944, first flew when he joined the Canadian Air Force in 1941

Milestone: The passionate pilot celebrated his 90th birthday with wife Linora in January

Mr Jones last flew the 70-year-old 
plane in December, just weeks before his milestone birthday, which he 
celebrated with wife Linora and more than 100 family and friends.

The father-of-five, from High River, Canada, is such as familiar sight in the skies above his home that the access road to the airport is being renamed Gordon Jones Way.

Mr Jones, who became a farmer after leaving the Air Force, also caught the attention of writer Anne Gafiuk, who has written his biography.

Wings Over High River, was released at the end of last year and has sold more than 200 copies.

Ms Gafiuk said: 'I thought I'd write 
the book, a few people would buy it and then I'd move on but I've made a
great friend in Gordon and there's been so much interest in his life.

'The book is just like a scrap book with lots of pictures, letters, jokes and stories so it's great to read.'

Pride and joy: Mr Jones spent £30,000 on his Tiger Moth and realised later he had flown in 10 times before

Passionate pilot: The former airman tries to get around 50 hours of flying time every year

Mr Jones added: 'I try to get about 
50 hours of flying time a year but most of that has to be in the summer 
because it's usually too cold to go up in the winter.

'Unfortunately the weather wasn't good enough for me to go up and fly on my actual birthday which is a shame.

'My Tiger Moth plane has been fully restored and is still in very good shape considering it's more than 70 years old.

'I'd like to carry on flying for as 
long as I'm able to and I'd surely like to think my family are happy for
me to still be flying.

'I'm hoping to carry on flying until the Department of Transport tell me otherwise because my eye sight is still good enough.'
