Javier Mascherano believes 'the pain' of Argentina's 1-0 extra-time World Cup final defeat to Germany 'will be there for life'.

Mario Gotze's 113th-minute strike sealed Germany's fourth World Cup and condemned Argentina to an agonising defeat at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.

Lionel Messi was unable to follow in Diego Maradona's footsteps and inspire La Albiceleste to the trophy.

And Mascherano says that the players will never forget the horrible feeling of the final loss because it was Argentina's 'chance' to win it.

The 30-year-old Barcelona midfielder said: 'Unfortunately the pain will be there for life because this was our chance.

'It is difficult to explain. It escaped from us at the last minute, we did everything to try and win. We had the best chances until we ran out of gas.

'The pain is immense because we wanted to take the World Cup back to Argentina but we gave everything.

'We are empty - we gave what we had and we are sorry for ourselves, for the people that came here and for the people that are in Argentina.

'Football is like this and we have to raise our heads and deal with the pain.'Â
