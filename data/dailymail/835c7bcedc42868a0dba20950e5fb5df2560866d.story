MIssing: Tom Armstrong has disappeared after travelling to Thailand to take a diving course on the island of Koh Tao

A mother has fought back tears as she made a plea for her son to get in touch after he failed to return home from Thailand after a trip to the country over Christmas.

Tom Armstrong, 22, vanished after taking a dive master course on the island of Koh Tao.

He was due to return home over the festive period, but his mother, Helen Armstrong-Bland, said he had postponed his flight to January 8 after 'running into trouble' in the Thai capital Bangkok.

However, Mr Armstrong, who lived with his mother 
and two younger siblings in Kelsale, near Ipswich, Suffolk, did not get on the plane.

Mrs Armstrong-Bland said: 'He was due to come home before Christmas but for whatever reason didn't arrive.

'That sent alarm bells ringing, but we received an email from him saying he had run into some kind of trouble in Bangkok.

'We thought it may have taken some time to get back to the island and that's why he hadn't been in contact.'

Mr Armstrong has not been heard from since and Suffolk Police have launched an appeal urging anyone who knows where he is to contact them.

The Ipswich-based art and design teacher added: 'We spoke to somebody at the dive centre to see if he had returned there okay and they informed us by e-mail that he had booked a new flight to return on January 9.

Worried: Mr Armstrong's mother, Helen Armstrong-Bland, said she received an email from him saying he had 'run into some kind of trouble' in Bangkok (above)

'But we did not receive details of this so we waited to hear details from him when he landed back in the UK.

'We waited for the last train from London but he didn't arrive. That's when we spoke to the police.'

Mrs Armstrong-Bland said their close-knit family was very worried and they were preparing to fly out to the Far East in a bid to track down Tom.

'We all really miss him and love him and want him to come home,' said the mother-of-four, fighting back tears.

She said Mr Armstrong has a younger sister, younger brother, and an older brother who lives in Japan.

Police said they were growing very concerned for him.

They said he had been in regular contact with his family through e-mail and Facebook until suddenly disappearing.

Mr Armstrong is 6ft 2in, of medium build with fair, slightly wavy medium length hair, and sometimes has a short beard, which is more red than fair in colour.
