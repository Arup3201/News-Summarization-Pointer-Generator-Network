The rookie air controller involved in the Moscow crash that killed leading French oil chief Christophe de Margerie was today formally accused of causing his death.

Svetlana Krivsun, 23, currently under house arrest, faces up to seven years in jail if found guilty of giving the order to Total boss's Falcon business jet to takeoff when a snowplough was on the runway.

The plane clipped the vehicle moments after leaving the ground, and exploded in a fireball, killing de Margerie and the three crew.

'Trainee traffic controller Krivsun has been charged with violating part 3 of article 263 of the Russian Criminal Code (violating safety rules for the exploitation of an aircraft leading to the accidental death of two or more persons). 

'She has been questioned as an accused person', said Russian Investigations Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin.

Further charges maybe made but so far she is the only one of five held in custody or under house arrest to be formally accused in connection with the death of the 63-year-old Total oil boss. 

Her supervisor Alexander Kruglov, 40, 'drunk' snowplough operator Vladimir Martynenko, the head of air traffic controllers at Vnukovo airport, and the chief of runway cleaning have also been held.

'The investigation suggests that these people did not respect the norms of flight security and ground operations, which led to the tragedy,' it said. 'They have been detained as suspects'.

The fallout from the tragedy continued today as the international airport's general director Andrei Dyakov and his deputy Sergei Solntsev both resigned 'due to the tragic event'. Neither was detained.

Mr de Margerie, chief of French oil conglomerate Total, and three crew died in the accident, which happened when their Dassault Falcon clipped a snowplough with its front wheel on take off from Vnucovo airport.

It span and slammed into the ground, bursting into flames and killing everybody aboard.

The crash is seen as doing huge damage to Russia's reputation for air safety, but the oilman's death is in itself a blow to the country.

Mr de Margerie was one of Russia's leading friends in global business and was returning to Paris from a meeting with premier Dmitry Medvedev.

Krivsun - a graduate of Ulyanovsk Higher Civil Aviation School, the largest in Russia - is under suspicion for giving the order to the Falcon's pilot to takeoff before the snowplough had cleared to a safe distance.

A colleague described her as 'dedicated and extremely competent'.

The airport added it was doing all it could 'to ensure the aviation incident is investigated quickly and objectively'. Investigators have already accused the airport authorities of 'criminal negligence'.

Martyenko was formally arrested and remanded in custody for two months today after investigators said he was 'drunk' in control of the snowplough.

Investigators released the results of his blood alcohol test, which they said showed a level of .06 percent. Russia has zero tolerance of alcohol for all drivers, let alone those working at airports, but that is below the .08 percent that is the legal limit for driving in the U.S. and Britain.

Interfax news agency reported that he had admitted drinking coffee with a liqueur before taking the wheel of the snowplough.

'If he remains at liberty, Martyenko can hide from the investigation, put pressure on witnesses and destroy evidence,' a hearing was told.

But his lawyer told a Moscow court today that the medical evidence that his client was drunk was 'absurd'. 

Alexander Karabanov said the 'drunk' medical opinion was based entirely on 'visual examination' not on a blood or other test. It was made immediately after the crash when Martynenko was suffering acute shock, he said.

'Why should we trust this?' he asked Basmanny Court. 'We can only trust the analysis findings, which we don't have.'

Mr Karabanov queried why it would take up to a week for the detailed medical results. But the court rejected his plea to put Martynenko under house arrest.

Judge Natalya Dudar said: 'According to preliminary examination data, Martynenko was under alcoholic influence, the final results will be known within five or seven days.' 

Martynenko, speaking to the court, admitted he felt 'horribly bad' over the crash. He admitted his involvement in the accident but protested he was not drunk, and insisted he obeyed orders.

'I know that I won't escape anywhere. I co-operate with the investigation,' he said.

'I feel that I am involved in this incident. I feel horribly bad now.'

The daily newspaper Izvestia had earlier reported speculation in the wake of Tuesday's tragedy about an inexperienced air traffic controller being involved.

'The aircraft's actions were really run by girl trainee,' said a source at Vnukovo airport.

'The instructor actually controls all the actions of the trainee,' and can intervene at any time.

'In addition, there is also a flight director who supervises the work of air traffic controllers.

'However, in the case of the Falcon crashed at Vnukovo air traffic controllers were not able to do anything.'

Another insider said: 'No one could see the vehicle. There was strong fog.'

But this source complained the 'quality of display equipment' was 'very poor'.

'As a result, when the vehicle moved out onto the runway unauthorised, it was not seen.' 

Members of Mr de Margerie's family were reported to be on their way to Moscow to return his body to France, to be buried in Normandy.

It remains unclear when investigators will release the body.
