Sharon Dixon, 54, died two days after choking on an egg during a pub eating competition

A coroner is warning pubs about the dangers of eating competitions after a contestant choked to death on a boiled egg.

Sharon Dixon, 54, was taking part in the egg eating contest to win a free drink when she collapsed at the Wellington Arms pub in Grimsby.

Staff tried to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre but Ms Dixon died in hospital two days later from a lack of oxygen to her brain, an inquest into her death heard.

Now, Coroner Paul Kelly says he will write to North East Lincolnshire Council to warn licensing officers about the dangers of people who have been drinking taking part in eating competitions in pubs and bars.

Mr Kelly heard that Ms Dixon, of Grimsby, had eaten up to five hard-boiled eggs and had been drinking.

She was believed to be one of five people who took part in the speed eating contest.

Rebecca Wood, leaseholder of the Wellington Arms, told the inquest yesterday: 'It seemed a bit of fun. I never thought of any risks or that anything would happen.'

Pub manager Thomas Pigott told the inquest he had organised a game of Russian roulette, where customers hit each other on the head with the eggs to see if they were raw or hard-boiled.

He later laid out five bowls with five eggs each for pubgoers to race each other to eat them the quickest, the Grimsby Telegraph reported.

Mr Pigott, who holds a valid first aid certificate, tried to perform the Heimlich and placed Ms Dixon, a former hairdresser and pub landlady, on her side.

Paramedics arrived at the pub within eight minutes and took her to the Diana, Princess of Wales hospital, but she could not be saved and died of a lack of oxygen to the brain.

Mr Kelly ruled that Ms Dixon's death, which happened on April 1 this year, was accidental.

Her daughter Toni Dixon described her mother as a 'generous' person and said: 'She was a very outgoing and confident person who was the life and soul of party and loved to dance.'

Following her mother's death, Toni Dixon called for everyone to be trained in first aid.
