Jockey Ruby Walsh has ended weeks of speculation by announcing he will ride favourite Faugheen in Tuesday’s Champion Hurdle.

The announcement means colleague Paul Townend will be on Faugheen’s Willie Mullins-trained stablemate Hurricane Fly, a dual winner of the race.

Walsh, who is riding at Sandown on Saturday afternoon, said: ‘You can only ride one and you have to ride the one you think will win. Riding Faugheen, younger legs might be the difference but there is every chance I might be wrong.

‘The drying conditions did not come into it. I think Cheltenham will put plenty of water on. Faugheen is the one I want to ride.’
