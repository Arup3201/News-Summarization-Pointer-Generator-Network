Texas rancher found skull in an empty canal close to town where she went missing

The body parts of a missing teenage girl have been found scattered across a field, authorities confirmed.

Investigators said the remains found in a field last October belonged to Sharon West, 14, who went missing on July 30.

The girl had been staying with a family friend when she went missing in Fannett, Texas, a small town of around 100 people, an hour north of Houston. 

A rancher called authorities three months
 later to report he had found a human skull in an empty canal on his 
property close to the town.

Tragic outcome: The remains of Sharon West, 14, who was missing for six months, were found in a field in Fannett, Texas, close to where she was staying with a friend

The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office confirmed last Friday that the remains were of Sharon West, who had been identified using dental records.

The girl's mother Sandra West confirmed that pyjama shorts and glasses found with the remains belonged to her daughter. 

An autopsy was underway to determine the teenager's cause of death along with toxicology reports.

The night before she went missing, Miss West's boyfriend, Austin Meaux, said he had last seen her at the home of the family friend whom she had been living with on a short-term basis while her mother looked for work. 

He told police that he was still at the home after the rest of the family went to bed at 2am.

The last contact with Miss West was at 5.20am when she texted a friend to say she was at a soccer field, a few miles from where she was staying.

The spot was a popular hang-out for young people. She sent another text 40 minutes later before the signal for her cellphone died.

Sandra West had set up a Facebook page while her daughter was missing. On October 20, the mother wrote: 'Sharon has been missing since July 30, 2011. She literally just vanished. There are so many stories, rumors, and scenarios about her disappearance.

'None of that matters. The only thing that matters is finding her. She has family and friends that love and miss her terribly.'

A memorial service for Sharon West will be held on January 28 in Hamshire, Texas.
