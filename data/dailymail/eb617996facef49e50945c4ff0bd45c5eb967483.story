Investigators have started dismantling the container where Nathaniel Kibby allegedly held 15-year-old Abigail Hernandez captive for nine months – as it emerged the structure may have had three separate, sound-proofed rooms.

FBI officers and State Troopers have been working on the crime scene 24 hours a day, since Kibby’s dramatic arrest at his home in Gorham, New Hampshire on Monday afternoon.

And on Wednesday, they stepped up their search for evidence and seemed to be using some kind of mechanical saw to cut into the shipping container, located behind the 34-year-old’s trailer.

What did they find? Police seen Wednesday cataloging evidence from inside a shipping container on Nathaniel Kibby's property in Gorham, New Hampshire. He was arraigned Tuesday on charges of kidnapping Abigail Hernandez in October

Prison cell: A law enforcement source told a local news station that they believe the shipping container was used to keep Abby hostage during the nine months she was missing

Safety: Investigators later donned bomb disposal gearr. Another police officer pictured on the suspect's property today

At one point, around 2pm, officers suddenly kitted up in what appeared to be bomb disposal, protective uniform, before searching the crime scene.

Full evidence boxes marked with biohazard symbols were also visible as FBI technicians worked intensely packing away material to be taken off for analysis.

MailOnline can also reveal FBI agents have been asking Kibby’s neighbors a string of baffling questions, including whether they had ever seen him burn or bury anything and whether he was often spotted digging.

Outing: Abigail's appearance in court came as a surprise since family friends said she wouldn't show. It was her first public appearance since mysteriously reappearing in her hometown on July 20

One neighbor was even asked whether he thought Kibby could have dug a tunnel from his trailer to the container.

The resident, who did not want to be named, said: ‘The FBI have been asking lots of different questions and they all seem to come back to the same couple of things. Have we ever seen him burning anything, or digging.

‘They asked me about digging and burying twice and they specifically asked whether he would have been able to dig a tunnel from the container to the trailer.

‘It seems very strange and makes you wonder what they think he was doing in there. I knew the guy and unfortunately I sometimes saw him on social occasions, but I tried to avoid him as much as possible. He was a strange man.

‘I know people who have been in that container and they say it was split into three rooms. He did a lot of work back there. It was sound proofed as far as I know.

‘I have heard he kept Abby in there for the whole winter. It would not surprise me. There is a lot of noise round here, with kids screaming and shouting, so it is possible no one would have heard anything, especially if it was sound proofed. He was always going back there. No one thought anything of it.

‘Still people are shocked about all of this. We all thought he would end up blowing something up, or going out in a blaze of glory, not something like this.

‘He was a gun nut, who hated anyone in authority. When I saw the officers putting their protective equipment on, I thought maybe he had set up a booby trap or something like that.’

Another neighbor, Glen Alden, told MailOnline that he saw Kibby burning something in his yard towards the end of February. He thought it was strange to be having a fire at that time of year, so he decided to record it on video. After a couple of months, nothing further came of the incident, so he deleted the footage. But he has told State Troopers since Kibby’s arrest.

Investigators were also seen looking through Kibby's mobile home
