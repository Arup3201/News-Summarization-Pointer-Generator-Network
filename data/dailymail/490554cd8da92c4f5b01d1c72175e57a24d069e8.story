When I was asked to try the new product from Coca-Cola - I knew I would be instantly transported back down nostalgia lane to my childhood.

Daily Mail Australia was offered an exclusive taste test of the soft drink giant's new beverage for the slightly more health conscious consumers out there known as 'balance-seekers'.

A can of Coca-Cola Life boasts 35 per cent less sugar thanks to the introduction of the natural sweetener Stevia - meaning it only contains 290 calories compared to the classic can's 450 calories.

Coke Life for the 'balance-seekers'

'Coke Life is absolutely about not only keeping pace with consumer needs and demands but hopefully trying to out-pace them,' Coca-Cola Group Marketing Manager Dianne Everett said.

The gleaming green can almost looks like an impersonator next to the traditional colours of the red, white, black and silver branding across the three others kinds of Coke.

Coca-Cola Group Marketing Manager Dianne Everett said the colour was chosen to stand out above its carbonated competitors.

'It's really about making sure we stand out on shelf with something that’s vibrant so that we are clearly positioning ourself as yet another vibrant addition to the Coke family - and it also compliments the rest of the family,' she said.

Trying the new Coke was a serious blast from the past for me as it was designed to taste like the classic product which I haven't had for probably for the best part of three decades.

Never having been much of a soft drink fan, I compared the can of Life to the Zero product which is marketed towards men who aren't enticed by Diet version.

As subtle as it may be - I felt that Coke Life tasted more like the real deal than Zero - which has no sugar but contains the controversial artificial sweetener Aspartame - as does Diet Coke.

Coca-Cola Group Marketing Manager Dianne Everett says the soft drink giant was under no illusion that its products were considered as part of a health range

Just before tasting Coke Life, I wrote a story on buses needing to increase the load limit by two tonnes to cater for the fact that Australian's waistlines have expanded almost 20 per cent between 1989 and 2012.

Aloysa Hourigan from Nutrition Australia mentioned to Daily Mail Australia that although the statistics were not surprising - she hoped that a downward trend of junk food consumption in America would be picked up Down Under.

'There are little glimmers of hope around such as in the U.S where the consumption of McDonald's and Coca Cola has been decreasing and their sales are dropping,' she said.

'Perhaps it will be a bit of a trend that might reflect back eventually on weight loss but it takes time to see those changes.'

Ms Everett expressed that the multi-million dollar international company had never marketed its products as a healthy range.

'We don’t attempt to market Coca Cola or any of our products - and certainly not even our latest in the line with Coke Life - as a health drink,’ she said. 

‘We are under no illusions we are operating in that space.'

'We are a fun great tasting drink that people consume on occasions that are relevant to them.'

Coca-Cola Life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant Stevia, which has been in Japan as a sweetener for over 30 years

'We truly believe obesity is a very complex issue and the causes of which are multi-factorial and our responsibility in this current environment is we want to continue to provide range and choice,' Ms Everett said. 

'Consumers ultimately decide the kind of portions, sizes and flavours that they are seeking which is all part of what we think we need to do to have that responsible social footprint.' 

Set to be launched in New Zealand and Australia in April next year, Coca Cola Life has already been launched in America, the U.K. and Argentina - where the product actually has an astounding 60 per cent less sugar to cater to that particular South American market.

Whether the die-hard Aussie Coke fans will embrace the new Coca Cola Life remains to be green.... I mean seen.
