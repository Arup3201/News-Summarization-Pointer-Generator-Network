Even when Xabi Alonso was at his masterful best, pulling the strings on his 33rd birthday, Manchester City’s supporters stayed true to their team. In the end, they got a remarkable reward.

Much has been made of the sterile atmosphere and yet the place was bouncing after Sergio Aguero’s brilliant hat-trick. What a night.

When the Etihad is like this, you want the good times to roll for this team. They are a special group of supporters when they get behind their team.

‘We fight to the end’ they sang throughout this extraordinary clash with Pep Guardiola’s side and somehow emerged victorious. How? Who cares.

Sergio Aguero’s winner was something else, a throwback to the days when City’s disbelieving fans were on the road to their first Barclays Premier League title in 2012. More of this, please.

All that was missing when Aguero sealed this incredible comeback was the Poznan, the celebration that followed some of the most dramatic moments in City’s recent history.

It cranked up the volume, sending City’s supporters happy as their uneasy relationship with European football’s elite competition continues its journey.

There is still a long way to go before they can match the special atmosphere on the Kop on those special European nights, but this was a start.

By the time they sang ‘Sergio, Sergio’ at the end, in the moments when he was walking off the field after his last minute substitution, this place was rocking.

Despite the top four finishes, the two Barclays Premier League titles in three seasons, City haven’t quite taken to this competition. Still, the marketing bods tried to do their bit here.

Before the teams walked out of the tunnel at the Etihad a few lads opposite the main stand began waving giant blue and white chequered flags in an effort to drum up an atmosphere.

It still feels like a long time before they will cross the finishing line in the Champions League.

The Bayern fans got their wish initially as they supported their side but couldn't predict the final outcome

They should be relishing these nights - putting their spat with UEFA over their £50m fine for breaching FFP regulations behind them - and getting on with the business of the day.

Bayern Munich are one of the biggest tickets in town right now, what with their poster boy team and a coach who would look at home on the cover of Esquire magazine.

Bayern were down to 10 men following the dismissal of central defender Medhio Benatia in the 20th minute for a foul on Aguero inside the area.

Aguero put them ahead, but Bayern - who completed 664 passes compared with City’s 444 - were still by far the more accomplished side.

Their fans, were fresh from the pop-up bars in city centre hotels providing them with litres of Bitburger to down in the hours before kick-off, made a right racket in the South Stand.

At the final whistle they drowned their sorrows.

They had stood for the full 90 minutes and urging Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski to pull this out of the bag.

They got their wish, pretty much as we always knew they would.

Those fans are a credit to their team, up there with the best behaved and most humorous travelling supporters in the sport.

They were in raptures five minutes before the break, lifting their red and white Bayern scarves above their heads to celebrate Alonso’s clever free-kick.

Then, just before the Czech referee Pavel Kralovec stopped for half-time, Lewandowski got in between Vincent Kompany and Bacary Sagna to head them in front. The place fell silent.

Bayern boss Pep Guardiola can barely watch as the game slips away from his stars

There had been brief moment of unity before kick-off, when supporters from both teams held up bright orange banners demanding ‘No to football behind closed doors’.

Correctly, both clubs believe they have been punished by UEFA’s decision to order CSKA Moscow to play home games behind closed doors because of a racist incident.

Still, the biggest crime here was just how Bayern Munich will return to Germany without, at the very least, a draw.

When Aguero scored the the equaliser it was bedlam in the stands and it was then that this stadium, fans included, mustered everything they had.

When he scored the winner, it felt like QPR all over again.
