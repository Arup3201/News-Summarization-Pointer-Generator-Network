A single New York mother has defended her decision to give birth to her second child at the age of 51, claiming that she is 'feeling super healthy' and that she now has the 'perfect family'. 

Tracey Khan, a successful publicist who lives with her two daughters in a $1 million apartment on the Upper East Side, welcomed her second child, Eloise Becket, on February 18, having given birth to her first baby Scarlett in May 2012.

'I’m beyond thrilled, the happiest I’ve been in my life,' Miss Khan told the New York Post of her new arrival. 'I’m feeling super healthy, and the baby is beautiful.'

Both Eloise and Scarlett were conceived via IVF and are both the product of donor eggs and donor sperm. However the same donors were used for both pregnancies, meaning the girls are actually biological sisters.

But while Miss Kahn went through her first round of IVF to conceive Scarlett at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York - at the age of 49 - the clinic refused to give her IVF treatment the second time around because she was too old to qualify under their regulations.

The businesswoman therefore enrolled for treatment at the Manhattan-based Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York, a fertility clinic which specializes in treating women who are over the age of 50 and works with mothers as old as 55. 

And despite her age - which some have claimed is too old to give birth to a child - Miss Kahn insists that both her pregnancy and her daughter Eloise's arrival went exactly according to plan.  

The little girl weighed a healthy 7 pounds and 6 ounces when she was born via C-section at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital at 10:37am. 

'Towards the end of the pregnancy, I was getting a little uncomfortable because of the extra weight, but otherwise it was pretty good,' Miss Kahn added.

The mother-of-two was also thrilled to add that her eldest daughter Scarlett is overjoyed to have a little sister - and even delivered a handmade card to her younger sibling at the hospital the day after she was born.

Miss Kahn confessed that two-year-old Scarlett was 'a deer caught in the headlights' when she first caught sight of her newborn sister, but quickly came around and 'now she absolutely adores her'.

Earlier this year, Miss Kahn, who is breast-feeding her newborn, admitted that she had employed a $350-a-day baby nurse to help her care for Scarlett during her first few months, and revealed that she now employs a full-time nanny to look after her daughter while she continues to work a full-time job. 

But while the businesswoman admitted that the costs involved in sourcing such hands-on chldcare are expensive, she added that, with an annual business turns over of $500,000, it is a luxury she can easily afford

Miss Kahn isn't, however, closed to the idea of finding a father for her two children, and is confident that she will one day find someone that they can share their life. 

'There are so many positive things to having a baby this late in life,' she said. 

'Yes, I’m older, but I’m in great shape. I have a great head on my shoulders, with a great system of friends. 

'...Would I love to get married and give my daughters a father one day? Absolutely. That’s next on my bucket list.'
