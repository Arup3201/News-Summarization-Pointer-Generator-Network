She had an emotional weekend, bravely continuing to play her piccolo despite the tears that were falling over her team, the Villanova Wildcats, being defeated by North Carolina State on Saturday.

But just a few seconds of the tender moment that was caught on the stadium cameras has turned Philadelphia student Roxanne Chalifoux into a viral sensation.

'I saw myself on the Jumbotron and all I could think about was that my dad was at the game,' she told Philadelhia's 94WIP radio station.

'I didn't want him to see me crying. 

'Little did I know that it was going to end up all over the Internet and that (my dad seeing me crying) was the least of my worries.'

Roxanne explained she was crying because, as a senior, that would be her last stint with the Villanova band.

'It was heartbreaking,' Roxanne said. 

'I’m a senior in the band, so I knew that was my very last game. 

'It’s just so easy to get emotional especially being a senior, that just changed the game for me, knowing it was my last game.'

Her tears quickly spawned memes and vines, and grabs of the footage were picked up by media outlets all over the country.

'I can’t even explain it,' she said. 

'I think it’s like such a silly video and then that everyone just thinks it’s hysterical.  

Roxanne added: 'People made it memes, people put Joe Biden with me. 

'Oh my gosh, how can you miss it? I’ve just been taking it in good spirits.

'It doesn’t bother me, I think it’s funny.' 

After graduating with a degree in biology, she plans to attend optometry school in the fall and plans to become an eye doctor.

But, now her days in the band are over, will Roxanne continue to play the piccolo?

She's not sure yet.  

'At least it's so tiny that I could pull it out and play it if I really wanted to,' she said.

Fallon presented Roxanne with a 'goodie basket' full of Tonight Show presents.

A huge Taylor Swift fan, Fallon also presented her with tickets to the singer's upcoming 1989 concert, which also made Roxanne cry again.
