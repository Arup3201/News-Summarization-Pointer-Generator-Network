A dozen years after 3-year-old Rosita Gonzalez's death, her alleged killer has still not been brought to justice.

The toddler died on October 15, 2002, just one day after being admitted to the hospital for vomiting and seizures. 

Doctors reported her symptoms to the police, saying they were consistent water intoxication, and the finger of blame fell on babysitter Nancy Gayoso, now 45.

Twelve years later, Gayoso has still not been brought to trial and remains free on bond thanks to several delays in her case. 

Too young: Twelve years after the death of 3-year-old Rosita Gonzalez, her accused killer still has not been tried in court 

This has left Gonazlez's mother Carmen Saldarriago Pinedo unable to heal from the incredibly traumatic experience of losing a child.

'There is no justice. It's been 12 years that I've lived in frustration,' Pinedo told the Sun-Sentinel. 

In 2002, Pinedo was a single mother renting a room in Gayoso's Hollywood, Florida home. When Gayoso offered to take care of little Rosita while her mother worked clearing tables at a Peruvian restaurant, Pinedo accepted. 

Killer? Babysitter Nancy Gayoso, now 45 (pictured), is suspected of forcing Rosita to drink nearly a gallon of water in just a four hour period 

After Rosita's untimely death, the medical examiner ruled it a homicide, saying the girl had been forced to ingest nearly a gallon of water in the four hours before she was hospitalized. 

That caused her sodium levels to drop and her brain to swell, sending her into shock and shutting down her vital organs.

During those four hours, Rosita was in the care of Gayoso, though she says the little girl ingested the water herself, while taking a bath. 

Because forced water intoxication is such an uncommon accusation, it took five months to bring up charges against Gayoso and she was eventually arrested in April 2003.  She spent one month in jail before being freed on bond.

Then, from 2004 to 2007 the case was again delayed after Gayoso was deemed  mentally unfit to stand trial 

In January 2010 the case hit another road bump when her defense attorney dropped out. 

However, defense attorney Luara Chukwuma, to this day believes in her former client's innocence.  

'Nancy is innocent, no doubt about that,' Chukwuma said. 'She is completely innocent, she is a good woman … she can't hurt a fly.'

Due to a change in Florida law, Gayoso is now facing much less prison time if convicted. 

Initially she was charged with first-degree murder, with aggravated child abuse as the underlying cause, which carries a maximum of life in prison sentence. But those charges have now been downgraded to aggravated manslaughter due to a tweak in the law which requires a pattern of abuse to prove aggravated child abuse. Now she faces only a maximum of 30 years in prison. 

However, it appears the trial may soon take place since March 1 marks the cut-off date for any remaining depositions, expert testimony or evidence in the case. 

And that's good news for Pinedo, who can finally see justice in the case of her daughter, who would be 15 today had she survived. 

'There is no way to describe this loss because there is nothing in the world that is more horrid than for a mother to lose a child,' Pinedo says. 

Now 43, Pinedo has since married and is mother to her 11-year-old twins and a 20-year-old stepdaughter.
