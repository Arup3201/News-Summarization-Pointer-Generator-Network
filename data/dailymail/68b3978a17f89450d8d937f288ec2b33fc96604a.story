A mother, who wanted to create an extravagant cake for her daughter's fourth birthday, went all out - by baking a four foot tall Peppa Pig cake.

Devoted Maria Young spent four days creating the 133,000-calorie treat to look like piglet George.

She got builder husband Wayne to make a wooden frame and then covered it in sponge, icing and Rice Krispies.

It's life size! Brooke Young's mother Maria, created the extravagant Peppa Pig themed cake for Brooke's fourth birthday

The end result was a cake taller than daughter Brooke, which at five and a half stone, weighed as much as a ten year-old and was enough to feed 700 people.

But thrifty Maria, 30, says it cost her just Â£100 after she took advantage of as many multi-buy offers as she could find.

She melted 17 bags of marshmallow into almost 12 boxes of Rice Krispies to create the legs and head, which alone weighed in excess of 15lbs.

Quite a mouthful: Maria's hard work resulted in a cake weighing five and a half stone

Good effort! Maria, 30, spent four days creating the 133,000-calorie treat to look like piglet George

She then baked five 12-inch vanilla sponge cakes, using 4lbs of flour, 4lbs of sugar, 4lbs of butter and three dozen large eggs.

She covered the big cake in almost 9lbs of buttercream, using 3lbs of butter and 6lbs of icing sugar.

Finally the whole thing was coated in 28lbs of icing made from 22lbs of fondant, 4lbs of icing sugar and 4lbs of butter - and six full bottles of food dye.

Brooke, her sister Emily, eight, and brother Logan, nine, helped put the cake together in the lounge of their home in Dorking, Surrey.

Hungry? Maria's masterpiece was enough to feed 700 people

Calorific: Doctors recommend girls aged four need 1200 calories every day, meaning the huge cake contains enough calories to feed little Brooke for more than 110 days

Enough to go around: Maria cut 40 portions of cake at the party and she says it barely made a dent

It was unveiled on Tuesday night at daughter Brooke's fourth birthday party in front of dozens of stunned family and friends.

Maria said: 'I'm so proud of this cake. It took absolutely ages, but that's what Brooke wanted.

'I asked her what she wanted for her birthday and said she wanted a super tall George cake.

'I'm surprised she didn't want Peppa, but I didn't want to argue - making trousers out of icing is much easier than making a dress.'

She added: 'The party was brilliant, everyone was talking about the cake. We must have cut out about 40 portions of the cake, and it barely made a dent.

Slow and steady: The gigantic cake took Maria four days to construct

Prepared to share: Maria says that any leftover cake will be taken to local food banks

'All my children have taken about 30 more servings each to school for their classmates, and Wayne took about ten big slabs to work for his mates.

'But even after all that, we've still got well over half of it left. I'm going to speak to my local food bank and ask if I can donate some cake to them.'

Maria, who has no formal baking training, is planning on setting up her own bakery, specialising in massive cakes.

Earlier this year for Emily's birthday, Maria made a My Little Pony cake containing 250,000 calories.

She said: 'George was much more difficult than the pony cake, because it involved a lot more sculpting and precision work.

'After the pony, I vowed to never go baking mad again, but when Brooke asked for a special cake like her sister's, I just couldn't say no.'

Doctors recommend girls aged four need 1200 calories every day, meaning the huge cake contains enough calories to feed little Brooke for more than 110 days.
