These are the incredible hyper-realistic paintings by an artist who has created almost everything imaginable in stunning detail - including the kitchen sink.

Roberto Bernardi, 39, spends up to a month painstakingly creating his visual masterpieces which look real enough you could eat the sweets he has painted.

But amazingly Mr Bernardi, from Todi, Italy, combines his skill with traditional painting techniques of oil on canvas and no manipulation to make his work look more real.

Realistic: These stunning paintings were created by Italian artist Roberto Bernadi, 39

His work, which sells for between $20,000 and up to $125,000, is sold through the Bernarducci Meisel Gallery in New York.

He said: 'I can find inspiration from anything - I may see a scene that catches my attention anywhere and either photograph that scene or take the essence of that scene and create a totally new composition.

'I normally focus on subjects considered banal, like the inside of a fridge, a washing-up machine, the inside of a sweet machine or simply sweets themselves.

'I like to portray them from an interesting point of view that reveals how interesting they actually are.

'I don't know why but for me art is about stealing moments of everyday life and this is where I find my inspiration.'

Mr Bernardi began honing his skills aged 18 when he started work - restoring paintings at the church of San Francesco a Ripa in Rome.

He added: 'This experience allowed me to work hard at my technical ability and at the same time sell reproductions I did allowing me to earn money to continue painting.'

Fruit bowl: Mr Bernadi said: 'I don't know why but for me art is about stealing moments of everyday life and this is where I find my inspiration'

Even the kitchen sink: This work shows the washing up waiting to be done

The fridge has bottles of juice, branded cheese and yoghurts which all look incredibly realistic

Speaking about his subjects, the artist said: 'I like to portray them from an interesting point of view that reveals how interesting they actually are'

How sweet: These traditional sweets look incredible in Mr Bernardi's painting

Good enough to eat: Anyone looking at this piece of art could be forgiven for thinking the sweets pictured here are real
