A callous dog owner battered his pet to death before hurling the animal from the balcony of his 15th-floor flat in an attempt to cover up the attack.

Dean Edwards, 44, beat two-and-a-half-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier Diesel so badly at his home in Bloxwich, Walsall, that he suffered 'catastrophic injuries' to his internal organs.

Edwards was yesterday jailed for six months after the RSPCA and police found Diesel lying in a pool of blood on the ground.

The vicious dog owner claimed at the time that the first he was knew of Diesel being on the ground was when he was alerted by a neighbour.

He told the neighbour he had thought the dog had been sleeping on his balcony and must have rolled off the edge.

Inspectors decided sick Edwards was 
lying, however, after blood was found on the balcony and inside the flat
 following the dog's death on November 15 last year.

Specialist vets said heavy bruising discovered on the dog's body was not consistent with a fall and that it was likely that Diesel was dead before hitting the ground.

Edwards has been banned from keeping dogs for life after he was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

Sentencing him, District Judge Michael Morris said: 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt you struck a fatal blow to Diesel and attempted to throw Diesel to the ground to cover your actions.'

During a two-day trial, Walsall Magistrates Court heard that baseball and rounders bats were seized at Edwards' flat after Diesel was killed.

Prosecuting Nick Sutton, said: 'The prosecution's case is that this man killed the dog and threw it from the balcony.

'He attempted to cover up the act by fabricating a fall.'

A spokesperson for the RSPCA said: 'We are pleased to hear Mr Edwards was convicted of the offences and the sentence reflects the seriousness of the offence.'
