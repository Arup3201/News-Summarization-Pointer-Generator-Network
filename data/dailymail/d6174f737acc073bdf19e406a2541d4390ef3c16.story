A manhunt is under way for Owen Bonner, 47, who once boasted he was 'worse than the devil'

A manhunt was under way last night for a dangerous psychiatric patient – who once boasted he was worse than the devil – after he absconded in a busy city centre.

The public have been warned not to approach Owen Bonner, who was declared insane by a judge during his trial for holding two women hostage in a factory.

The 47-year-old was on escorted leave from a secure hospital on Friday when he escaped in Glasgow city centre.

He has been in psychiatric care for the past 20 years after a brutal knife attack on the women during a five-hour siege in 1994.

Bonner is described as being 5ft 10in tall and slim. He has blue eyes and short grey hair. When he was last seen he was wearing blue jeans, a black body warmer and a black beanie hat.

Bonner took fellow workers Geraldine Henderson and Louise Ward hostage while they were on their shift at the Marshall’s Chunky Chicken factory, in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire. 

He made a series of bizarre demands, saying he wanted TV cameras, a Michael Jackson outfit and the popstar’s album Thriller. 

At one point, he dragged Ms Henderson across the floor, his arm wrapped tightly round her neck, and shouted: ‘I am worse than the devil. Pray with me.’
