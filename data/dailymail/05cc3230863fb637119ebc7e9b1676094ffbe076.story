Gentlemen really do prefer blondes. 

According to new research, the average American male would describe their 'perfect woman' as having blonde hair, blue eyes and - perhaps surprisingly - a graduate degree.

The survey, which was conducted by dating auction website WhatsYourPrice.com, also revealed that the majority of men prefer non-smokers, and, in an ideal world, would rather that their date was more of a social drinker, rather than someone who indulged in alcohol on a regular basis.  

Celebrity status: The average U.S. male's ideal woman has blonde hair and blue eyes, like supermodels Gigi Hadid (L) and Candice Swanepoel (R) 

Each of the 145,000 men who took part in the poll, were asked to attach a specific financial value to each attribute in order to come up with a total 'cost' for their ideal first date. 

For example, blonde hair was valued at an average of $59.31, while a slender body came in at $55.43.

But the most valued attribute of all was a graduate degree; the average price men were willing to pay to date a woman who had boasts a post-graduate qualification was a whopping $59.90. 

'The perfect woman must possess both style and substance,' says Brandon Wade, Founder and CEO of the site.

'The study confirms that men are willing to spend just as much on a woman's intellect and education as her physical qualities.' 

Models Gigi Hadid and Candice Swanepoel possess the same physical ideals that were highly ranked throughout the study. In addition to meeting the strict physical criteria, Gigi, 19, is currently studying for a degree in Criminal Psychology at The New School in New York City.

WhatsYourPrice.com calculated how money money its male members were willing to offer to date a woman with specific traits.

According to the data, men would pay an average of:

$59.31 for blonde hair

$54.92 for blue eyes

$55.43 for a slender body

$51.16 for a non-smoker

$49.67 on someone who is a social drinker

$59.90 for a female with a graduate degree 

WhatsYourPrice.com offered participants a wealth of different attributes to choose from, including hair color, eye color, body type, smoking and drinking habits and level of education.

The site calculated how much money the men were willing to offer to date a woman with specific traits, and then the qualities were ranked in relation to the average price paid for a first date.  

Slender women with blond hair, blue eyes, a graduate degree who drink only in social situations, but never smoke were deemed ideal.

Those features, which earned the highest cash offers, were combined to define 'The Perfect Woman.

On average, men in the U.S. were reportedly willing to spend $135.07 for a first date with someone with 'perfect' traits.
