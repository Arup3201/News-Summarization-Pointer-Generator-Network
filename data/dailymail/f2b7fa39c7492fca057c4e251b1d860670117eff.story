KFC Thailand has issued an apology after being criticised for a Facebook message that urged people to rush home during Wednesday's tsunami scare and order a bucket of KFC chicken.

As people were being urged to evacuate from beach areas, the company posted this message: 'Let's hurry home and follow the earthquake news. And don't forget to order your favorite KFC menu.'

It prompted hundreds of angry comments on a variety of Thai web forums that denounced the company as insensitive and selfish.

By Thursday the message was removed and replaced by one that asked for forgiveness.

Wednesday's earthquakes in Indonesia revived memories of the 2004 Asian tsunami that claimed 230,000 lives, including more than 8,000 people in Thailand.

Panic: People in Banda Aceh scramble to ecsape the city after a tsunami warning was issued

It follows news that five people died after suffering
heart attacks with several more injured in the aftermath of yesterday's Indonesian
tsunami earthquakes that sparked mass panic.

Two powerful earthquakes in the 
region's westernmost province, Aceh, triggered hysteria for millions of 
people as they fled high ground when a tsunami warning was raised.

Aceh, close to
the epicenter of yesterday's tremors, bore the brunt of the tidal wave 
eight years ago but millions were breathing a sigh of relief after the 
tsunami warnings were lifted.

Life
quickly got back to normal today as residents assessed the damage left 
by the earthquake, consisting of cracks in the walls of houses and 
structural damage to a bridge.

Usman Basyah, 45, who lost one of his
sons in the 2004 disaster that killed 170,000 people in Aceh alone, 
said: 'I really feel my prayers were answered. I'm so grateful.

'We've gone through enough trauma already.'

Buildings shook for four minutes and there were reports of people jumping from windows in a desperate attempt to escape.

Patients also poured out of hospitals, some with drips still attached to their arms. In some places, electricity was briefly cut.

There were also scenes of panic in Bangalore, India and Columbo in Sri Lanka as terrified people fled their homes and offices.

Then, two hours later, a massive aftershock - with a similarly huge 
magnitude of 8.2 - struck only 110 miles further out to sea, unleashing 
even more panic.

Tsunami waves, measuring 3ft in height, hit Sumatra, the island Aceh is on. But experts discovered that both quakes were the wrong type to issue a disaster and the warnings were lifted.

Roger Musson, seismologist at the 
British geological survey who has studied Sumatra's fault lines, said 
the earthquake was a strike-slip quake.

The tsunami triggering 9.1-magnitude earthquake of seven years go - which killed 230,000 people, three quarters of whom lived in Aceh - was a thrust quake, which causes
the sea bed to flip up.

The earthquakes occurred as Prime Minister David Cameron visited Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, which is 1,600 miles south-east of Aceh and on a different island, Java. No tremors were felt there.

He told President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono: ‘Our thoughts should be with those who are affected.

‘Britain of course stands ready to help if help is required.

‘We will stand with you and your government and your people at this time of worry.

Impact: Both quakes hit just a few hundred miles off the coast of Aceh. The first hit at 8.38am GMT. It was followed by a massive aftershock (marked 2) at 10.43am GMT.  The black star indicates the epicentre of the 2004 earthquake that triggered a devastating tsunami.

Mr 
Yudhoyono moved to calm nerves, saying that there appeared to be no 
serious casualties and local residents had been taken to safety.

He added that ‘as of this time there is no threat of tsunami’ - despite an international warning being issued.

He added: ‘The situation is under control so far. It is a very different situation from 2004 when Aceh was faced with a deadly tsunami.’

The tremor was felt in Singapore, Thailand, Bangladesh, Malaysia and India. A tsunami warning has been issued for cities all along the coast of Sumatra.

There were also reports of the water level dropping in the Thai resort of Phuket - a sign that the sea is drawing back in preparation to launch an enormous wave.

A tsunami watch means there is the potential for a tsunami, not that one is imminent. Since 2004 such warnings are issued after every earthquake in the Pacific.

Indonesia straddles a series of fault lines that makes the vast island nation prone to volcanic and seismic activity.

Last year's devastating tsunami in Japan was triggered by an earthquake with a similar hypocentre depth 20 miles below the surface.

The earthquake that struck 
off the coast of Aceh today has chilling parallels with the disaster 
that obliterated the region on Boxing Day, 2004.

More
than 230,000 thousand people were killed by the resulting tsunami that 
swept inland and washed away homes.

A further 250,000 people were 
injured by the catastrophe, which was the sixth deadliest ever recorded.

But
so unpredictable is the whim of nature that today's earthquake - 
despite being almost as powerful - has not had the same fatal effects.

The
tsunami that struck in the Indian Ocean in 2004, was caused by a 9.1 
magnitude earthquake. Today's earthquake measures 8.7 on the Richter 
scale.

Damage: Residents are swept away in the 
raging torrents that engulfed parts of Sri Lanka after the earthquake 
off the coast of Indonesia in 2004. The quake was more catastrophic than
the recent one

Although there is a slight difference in the strength, it would still be strong enough to cause significant damage.

The
biggest tsunami ever recorded was triggered by an 8.3 magnitude 
earthquake in Lituya Bay, Alaska on July 9, 1958 - less powerful than 
the most recent quake in Indonesia. 

And the Japan 2011 tsunami was 
brought on by 9.0 magnitude quake.

So why has today's quake not caused a killer tsunami?

The quake struck 20.5 miles below the sea bed whereas the one in 2004 was slightly closer to the sea at just 19 miles.

However, due to continual movement of
the plates over the last eight years there position today will be 
different to when disaster struck before. The position of the plates 
when one of them breaks and causes seismic waves is a vital part of what
causes the tsunami.

Although both earthquakes formed on the 
fault line where the India and Burma plates meet, today's earthquake did not cause disruption in the water.

Roger
Musson, seismologist at the British geological survey who has studied 
the fault lines off Sumatra in northern Indonesia said that today's 
tremor was a strike-slip quake, not a thrust quake which causes the sea 
bed to flip up.

It is not impossible for strike-slip earthquakes to generate vertical uplift of water,

'When I first saw this was an 8.7 near Sumatra, I was fearing the worst,' Mr Musson said.

'But as soon as I discovered what type of earthquake it was, then I felt a lot better.'

Mega
tsunamis strike when the plates create changes in the water pressure. 
The plates will have moved under each other differently today than how 
they did in 2004, creating less change in the water pressure.

Moreover,
researchers studying the 2004 quake found small but significant jumps 
of between 5 and 10 millimeters at stations as far as 3000 kilometres 
from the epicentre. They also found the rupture was 1000km long and 
spread rapidly northwards from its origin.

This
damage makes a significant difference because it is the 'snapping' 
motion of the earth's crust below the ocean that causes movement in the 
water above it.  If the plates do not displace a large amount of water, 
the power of the underwater waves will be less.

In
this case it appears that even though an underwater earthquake has been
recorded, the disruption to the sea bed has not been strong enough to 
create momentum in the water.

The
analyusts from Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris studied GPS data
showing that the  damage caused by the earthquake was at least 200km 
north of its epicentre.  

The severity and location of the  damage to seabed caused by today's earthquake is still unclear.

One
aspect of tsunamis that is within man's control are the warnings that 
can be put in place. In 2004 there were no alerts telling people that a 
tidal wave was on its way.

Following
the damage, The Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System was established 
following a United Nations conference in Kobe, Japan, in January 2005.

Seventeen
seismic stations were placed in the ocean to detect plate movements and
tremors. These sensors then pass the information to two recording 
stations which sound sirens and even make automated phone calls and send
text messages and emails to residents.
