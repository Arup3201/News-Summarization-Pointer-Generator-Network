Labour was engulfed by bitter recriminations yesterday after a new book reopened the wounds of the Blair-Brown years.

Douglas Alexander was forced to deny claims from former spindoctor Damian McBride that he knifed his politician sister Wendy.

The shadow foreign secretary is said to have told Gordon Brown ‘that she had to quit’ following a row about donations to her Scottish Labour leadership campaign.

Allegations: Damian McBride claims that Douglas Alexander, left, knifed hi politician sister Wendy, right, allegations that he denies

‘If I was sometimes cold-blooded about how I did my job, I had nothing on Douglas that day,’ Mr McBride wrote in his memoir.

Mr Alexander said: ‘I always supported my sister and I never supported Damian McBride. That might explain why he writes about me in those terms.

'He was discredited when he left Downing Street and that’s really all there is to say.

‘The style and approach of the politics he embodied has been completely discredited and thankfully the Labour party has moved on.

'I support Ed Miliband’s efforts to remove that type of politics from our party.’

When asked whether Mr McBride was lying, Mr Alexander replied: ‘It’s what Damian McBride does.’

Explosive allegations: Damian McBride made a series of claims in his new book

The Mail asked his sister yesterday about the claims and she simply said ‘I’ll leave that’ before closing the door.

A senior Labour source said: ‘Damian McBride helped us lose the last election and now it looks like he’s trying to lose us the next one as well.’

Mr McBride revealed in his book that he sought to end the careers of former home secretaries John Reid and Charles Clarke by leaking damaging allegations about them.

Neither was prepared to comment yesterday but David Blunkett, another Labour home secretary, rounded on Mr McBride.

He said: ‘It takes no intellectual effort  at all to churn out scurrilous tittle tattle and to rubbish those who you were supposed to be supporting, and whose lives were spent improving the wellbeing of others.

‘I had very few dealings with Damian McBride and no policy or campaigning contact with him at all.

'This now turns out to be extremely fortunate. It also demonstrates that, whatever Damian thinks, the world did not revolve around him or his machinations.’

Tony Blair’s former spindoctor Alastair Campbell tweeted: ‘Politics is a team game and the best players are the team players.

‘Gordon Brown had many many strengths and did some great things. But why he needed people like Damian McBride and Charlie Whelan [is] a mystery.’

Mario Dunn, who was former Health Secretary Alan Johnson’s special adviser, said: ‘Usually I don’t get agitated but this McBride stuff is really p***ing me off. #traitor.’

Ian McKenzie, an adviser to the former deputy prime minister John Prescott and leader of the House of Commons Anne Taylor, suggested Mr Brown should have fired Mr McBride, who was branded ‘McPoison’ by his critics.

‘I never witnessed anything like McPoison confession,’ he wrote. ‘Both my ministers would’ve sacked me forthwith.’

Mark Davies, who worked for Jack Straw, said: ‘Exactly. I had a very clear understanding of what was acceptable and what was not. Transgression would have meant exit.’

In a bizarre echo of the Blair-Brown wars that tore Labour apart for a decade, Ben Wegg-Prosser – a former aide to Lord Mandelson – yesterday sought to undermine Mr McBride’s revelations.

He leaked his Downing Street emails at the time of the ‘Curry House Plot’, in which Mr Brown’s allies succeeded in forcing Tony Blair to name a date for his retirement.

Mr Wegg-Prosser calls Mr McBride ‘Damian McP***kface’ in the emails.

He wrote yesterday: ‘Brown’s team were convinced the answer to every problem which Labour faced was that Blair should go.

‘The sheer emotional energy these scrapes consumed does not reflect well on any of the participants – me included.

Everyone who participated in them, from ministers, MPs, advisers and many more civil servants than is ever acknowledged, should reflect on what else could have been achieved if we weren’t fighting.’

Mr McBride hit back, saying: ‘I suppose the virtue of publishing old emails and diaries is it doesn’t require any self-criticism from those whose egos prevent that.’

Hilary Benn, Labour communities spokesman, told the BBC: ‘This is the past, we’ve changed.

‘Some of what happened is pretty unedifying but it is a postscript on the past. Damian McBride in the end lost his job, and rightly so given what was revealed, but that was a long time ago.’
