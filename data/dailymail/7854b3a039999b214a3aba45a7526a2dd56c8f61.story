Vast numbers of NHS staff may still be prevented from acting as whistleblowers, the head of the NHS Sir David Nicholson has privately admitted.

Sir David, who refused to stand down over the scandal at Stafford Hospital, claimed he would personally help staff expose abuses.

He told MPs on the Health Select Committee two months ago it was not only a legal duty but ‘vitally important to patient safety to make it happen’.

He added: ‘As someone who was personally involved in whistleblowing some
 years ago, I personally regard this as a really important issue for me.

Sir David Nicholson, NHS chief executive, admitted in a letter to an employee that he could not help them speak out because 'legal process' concluded foundation trusts are 'separate legal bodies'

'Wherever I see it, or if I have a whiff of it I immediately intervene 
in the organisations themselves and tell them what their 
responsibilities are in relation to that.’

But doctors have described his pledge as a sham after a letter emerged, written days later, in which he tells an NHS employee he cannot help them speak out because a ‘legal process’ had concluded foundation trusts are ‘separate legal bodies’ from the Department of Health.

The letter, seen by Channel 4 News, suggests vast number of NHS staff are therefore not covered by this duty of candour.

Foundation trusts, which run their own 
finances, were championed by the last Labour government and all 
hospitals are expected to be part of one by 2014.

One anonymous doctor - known as ‘Dr A’ told the programme she repeatedly
 complained about staffing levels she believed were putting her 
patients’ lives at risk.

Dr Peter Wilmshurst, a retired former whistleblower, told the programme about a junior doctor who complained about unethical behaviour.

The doctor was accused of dishonesty by their trust, which then spent £5million to keep them quiet.

Dr Wilmshurst and other whistleblowers called for an independent system 
so the doctor or nurse is not being 'tried' by the very people wanting 
to get rid of them.

NHS England said: ‘Sir David has always been clear he would intervene where he believed individuals were being stopped from whistleblowing.

'Sir David though does not, and has not had, the power to direct NHS Foundation Trusts.

'However, when contacted directly by individuals who are raising issues of concern relating to Foundation Trusts Sir David has raised these with Monitor and CQC where appropriate.’
