Liverpool are hopeful of striking a deal for Marseille teenage prospect Maxime Lopez in the summer despite ongoing interest from Arsenal.

The 16-year-old playmaker is rated the brightest prospect in the French club's youth system and that has prompted scouts from Europe's elite clubs to visit the south of France to take a closer look.

Lopez has figured against Arsenal in their UEFA Youth League ties but played 24 minutes as a substitute in the first game which Marseille lost 4-1 before pulling the strings in the return in November in a 1-1 draw.

Gilles Grimandi has been to watch him again in recent weeks but Liverpool invited Lopez and his family as guests for the Merseyside derby at Anfield.

Lopez is understood to have met with Brendan Rodgers and club staff underlined how youngsters are getting a chance to progress into the first team at Liverpool.

Rodgers, who has taken Liverpool staff for a sunshine break in Tenerife this week, will be able to attract more top players in the summer if Liverpool continue their impressive Premier League challenge.

He remains interested in Swansea duo Ben Davies and Michel Vorm while a deal for Dnipro's Yevhen Konoplyanka could be revived although they are weighing up alternatives.

Valencia's 24-year-old midfielder Dani Parejo, who had an ill-fated loan spell at QPR in 2008, has also been watched by Liverpool chief scout Barry Hunter at their recent game with Granada.

Sevilla have revived interest in Liverpool midfielder Suso. The 20-year-old has had a moderately successful loan spell in La Liga with Almeria who are struggling to avoid relegation and Sevilla are willing to give him a better platform.

Sevilla, who sold Luis Alberto to Liverpool for £7m last summer, are keen to open negotiations on a permanent deal for Suso who was highly coveted as a youngster at Cadiz before he joined Liverpool in 2010.

Sevilla sporting director Ramon Rodriguez Verdejo or 'Monchi' is renowned for his ability to revive player's careers and spot new talent and he believes he can help Suso to fulfil his early potential.

Real Madrid are continuing to rival Manchester United for Juventus pair Arturo Vidal and Paul Pogba.

Talks between Madrid and Juventus took place yesterday with Juve general manager Beppe Marotta visiting Real Madrid HQ before attending the international friendly between Spain and Italy. Marotta confirmed to Sky Italia: 'Today I did visit Real Madrid, but even if I had spoken about Pogba and Vidal I wouldn’t tell you.'

Manchester City's interest in Victor Wanyama has understandably been welcomed by the Kenya midfielder camp.

The 22-year-old joined Southampton from Celtic last summer for £12m after protracted negotiations which prompted his agent Ivan Modia to declare: 'He will not be railroaded into a move that is not right for him.'

Despite proving a success in his defensive midfield role, with Southampton conceding only 13 goals while he has been on the pitch in 18 games, Wanyama has taken time to settle on the south coast.

His stuttering return from injury this last few weeks has further unnerved him and City will take this into account as they continue to evaluate targets.

Preferred option: City are also keen on Newcastle's Ivory Coast midfielder Cheick Tiote (right)

They are keen to bring in a defensive midfielder and Newcastle's Cheick Tiote remains the preferred option but they will also be wary that he and international team-mate Yaya Toure will be wanted by Ivory Coast for the Africa Cup of Nations next year while Wanyama's Kenya will not qualify.

Meanwhile, Manchester City teenage midfielder Bersant Celina is ready to turn his back on Norway to commit his international future to Kosovo.

Middlesbrough are facing a battle to hold on to Grant Leadbitter after rival Championship clubs made enquiries to take him on loan this week.

Nottingham Forest have a long-standing interest in the 28-year-old midfielder who only has one year left on contract. He is well liked by manager Aitor Karanka who would like to extend his deal but Boro may struggle to compete with greater financial offers from elsewhere.

Sunderland will rival Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle, Tottenham and Arsenal in the race for Jamaal Lascelles from Nottingham Forest. The 20-year-old defender has impressed again this season and Lee Congerton who is set to become Sunderland's new director of football is understood to be a fan.

Hull City have given a trial to West Ham United full back Fraser Shaw. The 19-year-old who was released by Arsenal as a boy has been told he can find a new club. Shaw impressed for Hull reserves on Wednesday in their 5-2 win over Hartlepool United.

Derby County defender Kieron Freeman is to join Sheffield United on a month's loan. Freeman impressed for Wales Under 21s against England on Wednesday and has been targeted to provide cover for the injured John Brayford who joined on loan from Cardiff.

Aaron Ramsey is expected to sign his new contract at Arsenal by Friday. The Wales midfielder has earned his new deal after Barcelona, Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain all sent scouts to check on his remarkable upturn in form earlier this season. The 23-year-old is due to return to training after being out since Boxing Day with thigh and knee injuries.
