Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard faces the wrath of the Welsh management on Monday after he ‘jeopardised’ his fitness by playing against Harlequins.

The 30-year-old was left out of the Wales squad to face Fiji on Saturday because of a foot injury and was wearing a protective boot when he left Cardiff on Tuesday.

With Gloucester facing a front-row shortage, Hibbard was named on the bench for the Aviva Premiership fixture and came on as a late replacement in the 22-15 defeat, despite an earlier decision from the Welsh medical team that he was not fit enough to feature this weekend.

Speaking ahead of last night’s kick-off, Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde said the ex-Osprey, replaced in the Wales side by Scott Baldwin, now faces the risk of missing out on next week’s Test against New Zealand.

‘There’s a conflict,’ said McBryde. ‘He’s gone to Gloucester and ended up on the bench so something isn’t right there. You have to take responsibility for your actions, I’m sure nobody’s holding a gun to his head.

‘I understand there are injuries at the hooker position for Gloucester, but if he takes the field he jeopardises his position next week, from a fitness point of view. We will have no decision to make if we have to manage his injury again.’

However, Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys insisted his club had the blessing of the Wales management to put Hibbard on the bench.

He said: 'We did not have any problems with Wales. Clearly, we have no impact on Welsh selection. All I will say is that we had discussions with the Welsh management yesterday and it was agreed with the Welsh management that Richard would be sitting on the bench tonight.

'We are unaware of what changed between last night and this morning. We want Richard to be playing against New Zealand and look forward to seeing him against them.

'The starting point in all these discussions is we wouldn’t do anything that jeopardised player welfare and, as far as we were concerned, Richard was fit to play and that was agreed with the Welsh management yesterday afternoon.

'We are very surprised by this. As far as we are concerned, there was no issue. I don’t think this is something which should been made a big issue.'
