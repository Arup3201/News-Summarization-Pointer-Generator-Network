Everton manager Roberto Martinez joked Ross Barkley looks more natural with a ball at his feet than without it after the 20-year-old made an inspirational comeback at Goodison Park.

The England midfielder is not just a huge talent, conservatively valued at £40million, he is also a talisman and leader for his club.

Having suffered knee ligament damage in pre-season, he showed remarkable fizz and energy in his first outing of the season to lift senior colleagues who had started the weekend on the fringes of the relegation zone.

Barkley helped set up the first two goals and earned a standing ovation when he was substituted in the second half, before Seamus Coleman added a third.

Martinez’s smile was only matched by that of Roy Hodgson’s assistant Ray Lewington, who will surely tell the England boss to pencil in Barkley’s name for the next Euro 2016 qualifier, against Slovenia.

‘I didn’t think there was any way eight days ago Ross could have started this game. But he’s been phenomenal in the last week and when he curled one in the top corner in training, it was a message to me,’ Martinez said.

‘It was like he’d been involved in every game this season. You ask yourself if he was born to play football. He looks more natural with a ball than without it. As humans, that’s not right!’

Everton had not won in their previous three League games but Barkley brought the feel-good factor rushing back with an audacious shot that was tipped around the post by Brad Guzan.

From the following short corner, Leighton Baines turned Ashley Westwood inside-out and delivered the perfect cross, right-footed for once, for Phil Jagielka to head in.

The 32-year-old skipper did not score at all for Everton last season but now has three in six games for club and country, including a Merseyside derby classic and a Wembley goal against San Marino.

Villa boss Paul Lambert, who gave Christian Benteke his first start since March, accepted his side were second-best. ‘We didn’t deserve anything out of the game,’ he conceded.

The only surprise was it took Everton until the 48th minute to extend their lead. Barkley played in Lukaku with the outside of his boot and Guzan let his shot squeeze through his hands.

With the game won, Martinez hooked the ‘sensational’ Barkley, though he admitted the player looked fresh and would have carried on if asked.

Everton did not need him by that stage. Seamus Coleman ran across Aly Cissokho to hook in another Baines cross for 3-0 after 76 minutes. ‘A ridiculous goal to give away,’ said Lambert.

Martinez seemed as pleased with the clean sheet as anything else. ‘We haven’t been solid enough in defence this season but today we had that right intensity. We stopped Villa being a threat and that is an incredible achievement against a team with Benteke and Gabby Agbonlahor,’ he said.

He knows he has a special talent on his hands in Barkley. ‘Normally players either have good technical ability or good physical ability. He has both,’ said the Spaniard.

For Villa, it is back to the drawing board. ‘Tom Cleverley and Alan Hutton were good but you can’t win games with only two of them,’ added Lambert.
