Demi Moore has announced she is ending her six year marriage to Ashton Kutcher.

The 49-year-old actress said in a statement today that she is filing for divorce with 'great sadness and a heavy heart'.

Hinting at Kutcher's infidelity, Demi said: 'As a woman, a mother 
and a wife, there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it
 is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life'.

Moore added that it's a trying time for her and her family and asked for people to respect her privacy.

Immediately after the announcement, 33-year-old Ashton posted his own statement on Twitter.

He wrote: 'I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi.

'Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail. Love and Light, AK.'

The pair are still following each other on Twitter in wake of the announcement and Demi's handle remains @mrskutcher - something she may now consider changing.

Despite their dignified statements, Demi is now gearing up to battle it out over their $290m fortune after enduring public humiliated because of his alleged infidelity.

Message
 to fans: Ashton released his own statement on Twitter following Demi's 
announcement, saying he will always cherish the time they had together

Moore and Kutcher wed in 
September 2005. The couple's relationship hit the headlines in recent months as rumours swirled about Kutcher's alleged infidelity.

The Two And A Half Men star allegedly
 shared a night of passion with party girl Sara Leal, 22, at the Hard 
Rock Hotel in San Diego.

Texas-born
 Leal sold her story on Kutcher weeks after the fling, which took place 
on Ashton and Demi's sixth wedding anniversary, September 24.

Leal relived the sordid details of 
the night - including how they had unprotected sex - detailing that she had cavorted naked with Kutcher and a gaggle of 
girls in a hot tub in the luxurious hotel suite.

She claimed Kutcher told her he was separated from Demi before the Two And A
 Half Men star tried to persuade her to have a threesome along with her best friend 
Marta Borzuchowski - but in the end he settled for a two-hour romp with 
her.

Speaking of the fling, she told The Sun: 'We had sex twice. 
Everything felt natural. We were having a good time. He was good, but it
wasn't weird or perverted or creepy.

'He had good endurance. We were up for a while. It was about two hours.'

In the weeks after the story broke, Kutcher and Moore made apparent attempts to heal their relationship with Kabbalah retreats, including a camping trip to Cachuma Lake near Santa Barbara, California, last month.

The couple were accompanied by some close friends along with their Kabbalah instructor Yehuda Berg and photos emerged of the pair sat around an outdoor fire.

It was first time they were pictured together since news of Kutcher's alleged booze-fuelled one-night stand broke.

In the weeks that followed, Demi appeared to be suffering under the strain of her marriage breakdown, becoming gaunt and scarily skinny - reportedly dropping down to just 7st (98lbs) which given her height of 5ft 5in is considerably underweight.

The Leal affair was not the first time Kutcher has been accused of being unfaithful to Demi.

Kutcher was first accused of  infidelity in September last year, when Brittney Jones, 21, said she had sex with the actor at the Beverly Hills home he once shared with his wife while she was away.

She also later claimed that Kutcher told her he had an open relationship with Demi and they would 'often engage in threesomes'.

Jones told Star: 'He looked over our 
texts and said he wanted me to delete all the messages from him. He then
 told me he wanted me to delete the texts I had sent to him. He said 
they could hurt him.'

At the time, the couple, who are worth  an estimated £95million, brushed off the allegations.

Kutcher, who took over Charlie 
Sheen’s role in hit U.S. TV series Two And A Half Men earlier this year,
 wrote on Twitter at the time: 'I think Star magazine calling me a 
"cheater" qualifies as defamation of character. I hope my lawyer 
agrees.'

He added: 'Star magazine – you don’t get to stand behind "freedom of the press" when you are writing fiction.'

Kutcher’s spokesman also denied the allegation while Miss Moore tweeted ‘Excellent point my love!’

Moore, who was previously married to Bruce Willis, started dating Kutcher in 2003. They married two years later.

In May last year Demi talked about wanting to start a family with Kutcher in an interview with Elle magazine - something that never came to pass.

The actress has three daughter with her ex Willis - Rumer, 23, Scout, 20, and Tallulah 17.

She
 has maintained a friendly relationship with the Die Hard star - even attending 
his wedding to underwear model Emma Heming in 2009. By the same token, 
Willis came to Demi and Ashton's wedding four years earlier.

Moore and Willis married in 1987 before divorcing 13 years later in 2000.

At the time of the split, Willis said: 'I felt I had failed as a father and a husband by not being able to make it work.'

Moore, who starred alongside Patrick Swayze in the 1990 movie Ghost, was first married to singer Freddy Moore.

They got hitched when she was aged 18 in 1980 and the relationship lasted four years. She still goes by his last name.

For Ashton - who is 16 years Demi's junior - Moore was his first wife.

He previously had relationships with the late Brittany Murphy and Mad Men's January Jones.

Today's news tops off a bad run for Ashton, who last week was at the centre of a Twitter fallout after posting messages of support for Pennsylvania 
State University football coach Joe Paterno.

Paterno, Penn State head coach for 46 years, had been fired for 
allegedly covering up sexual abuse by the school's former football 
defence coordinator Jerry Sandusky.

Kutcher responded to the news by tweeting: 'How do
 you fire Jo Pa? #insult #noclass as a hawkeye [the University of Iowa 
football team] fan I find it in poor taste.'

But his remarks cause a furious backlash - forcing Kutcher to admit he didn't have the full facts when he posted the message.

He then handed the control of his Twitter feed over to his management team at  Katalyst Media to 'ensure the quality of its content'.

MAY
 31, 2003: After two failed marriages and a spell away from the 
spotlight, Demi Moore surprises all of Hollywood by stepping out with 
younger man, Ashton Kutcher. The pair, who are 16 years apart, make

the father of her three children, Bruce Willis.

 intimate details of their home life. Ashton even posts a picture of 
Demi bending over in a bikini, adding: 'Shhh don't tell wifey'.

 At 47, Demi, tells UK ELLE that she dreams of starting a family with

doubt that if it’s in our future, it would be another incredible part of
 our journey together.' 

SEPT 2010:
 As their fifth wedding anniversary approaches, Ashton is accused of 
having an affair with a 21-year-old California in a tabloid magazine.

with Demi and her daughters. He
 brands the claims a 'defamation of character' and the pair maintain a 
united front. 

SEPT 2011 A tabloid magazine publishes claims 
that Ashton cheated on his wife during a weekend partying in San 
Diego. The encounter with party girl Sara Leal, 22, is said to have 
taken place on the 12th floor of the Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego, 
California, in the early hours of Saturday – the Hollywood couple’s 
sixth wedding anniversary.
