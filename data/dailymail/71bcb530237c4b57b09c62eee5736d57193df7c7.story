Clare Balding has revealed she wants to marry her civil partner Alice Arnold.

The TV presenter, who won acclaim this year for her coverage of the Olympic and Paralympic

Games, said: ‘As far as marriage is concerned, I’d like to marry for the verb.

'The “civilly partnered” phrase is a bit unwieldy. Otherwise I can’t see it making any difference to us.’

In an interview for today’s Mail on Sunday You magazine, the  41-year-old star insists that the pressures of fame have not impacted on the quiet domestic life she enjoys with her long-time partner Alice, 50, a Radio 4 announcer and newsreader.

She said: ‘Neither of us cooks. Anything. Apart from a roast –  but I’ve discovered you can’t eat  a roast every day, so we have a lot of lovely ready-meals.

'To relax, we play golf, very competitively, and Alice goes to bingo a lot when I’m away. We’re such a glamorous couple, aren’t we?

‘Being a lesbian is the least interesting thing about me. And the least relevant thing to my job. But it’s probably the most important characteristic in terms of changing the world, because if I am relaxed and comfortable about it, then other people are, too.’

Balding said she had considered shedding 10lb prior to the Olympics but changed her mind after taking advice from a friend.

She said: ‘I was mulling it over with swimmer Keri-Anne Payne. I asked rhetorically if she thought it would make a big difference and she said, “Yes, it will make a big difference,” and just as I was thinking, “You complete cow” she added that if I was starving myself my mind would be less sharp, my concentration lower and I’d be so busy thinking about eating or not eating that my on-screen performance would be seriously impaired. And, you know, she was so right.’
