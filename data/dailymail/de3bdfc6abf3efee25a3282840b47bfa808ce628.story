Rolando Aarons admits he has surprised even himself in emerging as the star of Newcastle’s pre-season after working throughout the summer in a bid to win a first-team breakthrough.

United manager Alan Pardew and assistant John Carver were taken aback by the sharpness of the 18-year-old when he reported for duty at the start of July.

And that was enough to win him a place on the tour of New Zealand last month and last weekend’s trip to Germany, where he won rave reviews having terrorised Champions League outfit Schalke.

Aarons, a tricky winger with a blistering turn of pace, is likely to earn a place on the bench for the Premier League opener with Manchester City a week on Sunday.

But now he’s had a taste of senior action it has left him wanting more.

‘It is up to the manager, but I’m going to try and make his decision as difficult as possible, it’s my job really,’ he said.

‘I’m no-one yet. It is just pre-season and I haven’t done anything in big games, so I’m just going to keep my head down and work hard.’

And Aarons would rather not head out on loan this season.

‘I’m hoping to get involved in a first team this season and make an impact,’ he added.

‘Before every game I pray to not be injured and just go out and be guided to a performance.

‘I worked so hard off-season. I wasn’t expecting to be pushing for the first team, so I’m surprised.But I’m happy with what I did off-season – it gave me the opportunity to do what I’m doing here.’

On the run: Aarons uses his pace to get away from Huddersfield's Phillip Billing at the John Smith's Stadium
