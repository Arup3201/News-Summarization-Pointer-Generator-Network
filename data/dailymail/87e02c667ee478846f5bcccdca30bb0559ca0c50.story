Clambering over each other, these adorable puppies look the picture of happiness.

But life could have been very different for the eight newborns, after their mother was bitten by a snake and nearly died - just two days after they were born.

A near lethal snake bite by an adder left Tatty the Golden Labrador fighting for her life just 48 hours after she gave birth to her pups.

Tatty was rushed to the vets leaving Ginny Faulkner and Chrissy Berry to round-the-clock bottle feed the puppies every three hours.

Tatty, who lives on Dartmoor in Devon, left her puppies for 10 minutes to stretch her legs in a nearby paddock and encountered the bad tempered snake that bite her on the shoulder.

Within minutes she was found slumped in with her pups howling in agony as her snake wound ballooned.

Dog owner Charlotte Faulkner said that the family were all shocked to see Tatty in such pain just a couple of days after the excitement of eight new puppies.

At one point Tatty was unconscious but still able to feed some of the pups with help from the vet

Said Charlotte: 'We noticed that she wasn’t herself when she came back in, she was in so much pain that she howled if you touched her shoulder.'

Tatty was rushed to Dart Vale Vet in Totnes where she was put on a drip and heavily sedated to ease her pain.

Tatty’s pups were brought in to visit and suckle on their mum even though she was barley conscious.

'Tatty went through a dangerous 48 hours but thankfully pulled through.' said Charlotte.

'It shows what a brilliant mum she is, to carry on feeding through all that was amazing of her.'

Dart Vale Vet Group reported that they have treated 6 dogs in the last week for adder bites on Dartmoor.

Adders are Britain’s only poisonous snakes and normally attack when they are disturbed.

Adders will only use their venom as a last means of defence, usually if caught or trodden on

Adders will only use their venom as a last means of defence, usually if caught or trodden on. No one has died from adder bite in Britain for over 20 years.

With proper treatment, the worst effects are nausea and drowsiness, followed by severe swelling and bruising in the area of the bite.

Adders usually eat small rodents, such as the short-tailed vole.

They will also eat lizards, frogs and newts, and have been seen taking young from the nests of ground nesting birds.

When hunting, adders strike swiftly at the prey, injecting a lethal dose of venom, the Forestry Commission says.

They then wait until the prey dies before starting the often lengthy swallowing process.
