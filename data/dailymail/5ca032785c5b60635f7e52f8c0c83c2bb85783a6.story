Developers want to bulldoze a 12th-century forest to make way for a motorway petrol station - in the first attempt to use a possible new planning loophole.

In a crucial test case, Extra MSA Group has submitted a formal planning application to destroy 20 acres of ancient woodland, and offered to plant twice as many new trees nearby.

The firm, which specialises in building motorway services, is the first to attempt to use the controversial process, known as ‘biodiversity offsetting’, for ancient woodland.

Smithy Wood is a haven for a variety of ancient woodland plants, fungi and butterflies. But developers want to bulldoze the 12th-century forest to make way for a motorway petrol station

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is very keen on the idea of offsetting as a way to balance economic development with environmental concerns.

In January he proposed the idea of ‘mandatory’ offsetting, in order to force developers to plant new trees.

But wildlife groups say it is a travesty to suggest that ancient woodlands, which in this case are 850 years old, could be replaced overnight.

They are worried the proposals will create a loophole that allows developers to freely concrete over Britain’s forests.

The new planning application is for £40million development at Smithy Woods near Sheffield, an ancient forest that dates back to 1161.

The plan for the site at junction 35 of the M1 includes filling stations, shops, a food court, an 80-bedroom hotel and a huge car park with space for 639 vehicles.

Smithy Wood is designated as a local wildlife site within Sheffield’s Green Belt, and is a haven for plants, fungi, butterflies and threatened birds including the song thrush, dunnock, bullfinch and stock dove.

Sheffield City Council’s treatment of the application will be a vital test of offsetting - and of the ability of the Government’s planning rules to protect ancient woodland.

Penistone and Stocksbridge MP Angela Smith, whose constituency includes Smithy Woods, said: ‘This application is a cynical attempt to overcome objections to the proposed destruction of ancient woodland by making use of “offsetting”. 

‘Local people, however, will not be easily bought and will fight hard to defend this precious habitat.

‘Once lost, this woodland can never be replaced.

‘Surely it’s time to strengthen the protection of ancient woodland, given that we’ve lost so much of it already; what we have left, we must conserve rather than destroy.’

The Environment Secretary recently said destroying ancient woodlands would be a ‘travesty’ but admitted that offsetting could be used for even the most cherished sites.

Crucially, he has said that planning regulations should be sufficient to protect ancient forests - something that will be put to the test in Sheffield.

Mr Paterson told the House of Commons in January: ‘Should we bring in offsetting, all the regulations remain. Only at the last moment would we consider offsetting.’

The Government has launched a consultation on the idea, which is due back this summer, but the Sheffield proposal will provide an early indication as to whether planning rules are robust enough to stop it being used for ancient woods.

Nikki Williams, campaigner at the Woodland Trust, said: ‘The plans revealed by Extra Motorway Services might look at first glance to be very grand and environmentally friendly, but you need only scratch the surface to discover that this is an example of the attempted use of biodiversity offsetting at its very worst.

‘There is no escaping that 21 acres of ancient woodland will be destroyed should this application be approved and no amount of compensation will ever make up for the loss of this irreplaceable habitat.’

Extra MSA Group chief executive Andrew Long said: ‘Having established a clear requirement for a new motorway services area at Junction 35 of the M1, we are confident that our proposals can facilitate another flagship, job-creating development that will significantly enhance the local economy.’

The firm has pledged to create a new 39-acre woodland with 60,000 new trees open to the public for recreational use.

Another 172 acres of privately owned woodland will be opened up to the public.

A Government spokesman said: ‘Ancient woodlands are safeguarded and the planning rules are very clear that development should be avoided.’
