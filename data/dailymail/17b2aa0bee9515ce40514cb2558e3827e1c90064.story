A three-year-old girl who is unable to speak or move her hands could be able to communicate with her family thanks to a computer which she would control with her eyes.

Georgia Edwards is 'locked inside her body' after Global Development Delay prevented her from communicating easily or feeding herself.

The condition has left the toddler completely dependent on her family.

'Locked in her body': Three-year-old Georgia Edwards is unable to speak or feed herself because of a condition called Global Development Delay

Loving: Georgia's mother Katie gives her three-year-old daughter a cuddle at the family home in Wrexham, north Wales

Her parents Gavin, 28, and Katie, 26, are unsure what the future holds for their daughter and hope that eye-gaze technology could help her development.

Georgia's mother Katie, from Wrexham, north Wales, said: 'She is completely dependent on us.

'It's a lot of hard work but she's very lovely so we can't complain.

'We want to give her as many opportunities as we can to allow her to live as fulfilling a life as possible.'

The couple believe that the eye-gaze computer would make life easier both for them and their daughter.

'It would give her a more independent way of life,' added Katie.

'She can get so frustrated.

Family support: The youngsters parents are hoping to raise £3,000 for new technology that will allow Georgia, pictured with her brother Charile, to communicate using her eyes

'It can be difficult to sooth her, she can get upset with everything.'

Despite her speech regressing, Georgia is still able to walk and has been receiving therapy at Wrexham Child Health Centre.

Her family is looking to raise £3,000 to buy eye-gaze equipment for their daughter having raised £2,500 for her treatment last year and a further £400 to buy an adapted pushchair with a big breakfast event.

They are now planning a range of similar events as part of the Georgie Pie's Brighter Future campaign.

Katie said: 'The amount of people who have been getting behind us is much appreciated. We've received overwhelming support from the local community.'
