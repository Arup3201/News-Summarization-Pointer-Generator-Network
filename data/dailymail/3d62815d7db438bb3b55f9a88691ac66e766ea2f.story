Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger confirmed his interest in signing Mings in early December, with the Frenchman expected to launch an £8million bid once the January transfer window opens.

Mings added: 'I have hands-free, which I would usually use. I am in a position to pay a penalty if the court sees fit.'

District Judge Celia Dawson gave Mings three points on his licence and a £200 fine, plus £85 statutory surcharge and £20 costs.

Mings made his debut for Ipswich in May 2013 after signing for £10,000 the year before, and the Championship club have been demanding between £8m and £10m for Wenger to get the defender.
