Wearing a hat and gown and graduating with three degrees, you could be mistaken for thinking Maadhav Shah is walking out of one of the country's top universities.

In fact, 16-year-old Shah isn't even out of high school yet, where he has just managed to get a perfect score on his SAT tests.

Shah graduated from American River College (ARC), Sacramento, on Wednesday with associates degrees in maths, physical science and social science while still studying at nearby Granite Bay High School.

According to Fox 40, Shah has been studying at ARC since he was ten. Usually students have to be at least 16 to start, but in Shah's case instructors made an exception.

The experience was far from typical for Shah, who had to take his mother to class with him because of his young age, but he says he managed to make friends and enjoyed his time at the college.

Alongside his three degrees, Shah also managed to pass his SAT tests with a perfect score of 2,400. Last year less than 500 students who took the tests, or just 0.03 per cent, achieved that score.

Shah completed courses at college while still studying at Granite Bay High School, where he will be a senior next year. He says he will now apply to study engineering at Stanford and Cal Tech

He told Fox: 'When I saw it (the score), I checked to make sure it was my name and my email, and then I was really happy.'

Shah is now preparing for his senior year in high school, and is planning to apply to the likes of Stanford and Cal Tech to study a four-year course in engineering.
