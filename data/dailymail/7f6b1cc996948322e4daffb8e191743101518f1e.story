Arsenal stars have been limbering up for this month's FA Cup final with a good old-fashioned sing-song.

Usually heard by fans on the terraces, members of the Gunners' first-team squad have recorded their own rendition of the Arsenal chant 'She wore a yellow ribbon' ahead of the club's Wembley showdown against Hull on May 17.

Giant German defender Per Mertesacker is first to show off his singing capabilities, starting the chant of 'She wore!' as he points towards the camera.

Sing-song: Arsenal players have recorded their own rendition of 'She wore' ahead of the FA Cup final

Giving it some welly: Per Mertesacker points forcibly at the camera after starting chants of 'She wore!'

Pals: Tomas Rosicky and Laurent Koscielny were in high spirits as the Arsenal pair took part in the sing-along

Czech winger Tomas Rosicky and French 
centre back Laurent Koscielny are next to take centre stage and are 
followed by English pair Carl Jenkinson, a boyhood Arsenal fan, and Alex
 Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Slightly out of tune, but giving their all for the Arsenal cause, the foursome belt out the line 'We're the famous Arsenal and we're going to Wembley!'

French defender Bacary Sagna, who seems to have picked up a cockney accent during his seven years in the capital, and compatriot Mathieu Flamini, appeared far more laid back as they took over singing duties before Thomas Vermaelen delivered the last line.

An annual occurrence in years gone by, the tradition of players joining together and releasing an FA Cup song has certainly faded in more recent times.

Arsene Wenger's side will be looking to end their nine-year trophy drought when they meet the Tigers in this month's Wembley showdown.

She wore! She wore! She wore a yellow ribbon!She wore a yellow ribbon in the merry month of May,And when I asked her why she wore that ribbon,She said: 'It's for the Arsenal and we’re going to Wembley!'Wembley! Wembley! We’re the famous Arsenal and we’re going to Wembley!

Passion: Boyhood Arsenal fan Carl Jenkinson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain sing loud and proud
