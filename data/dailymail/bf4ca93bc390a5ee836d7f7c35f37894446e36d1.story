The number of manhole covers exploding has dramatically increased according to new figures released by the Health and Safety Executive.

Experts believe the fireballs are caused by power surges in underground electric junction boxes which could have been damaged by last winter's record rainfall.

So far this year, the HSE has received 64 reports of exploding or burning manhole covers - compared with 51 for the whole of 2013. There were just nine in 2011.

The fire, which was outside the BAFTA headquarters in Piccadilly, London destroyed a van after the manhole cover exploded

Firefighters attached a long line to the burning van and pulled it away from the manhole cover which continued to explode and shoot flame into the sky

Experts believe that water may have seeped into the high-voltage electric cable causing the explosion

Experts believe that the cables may have been damaged by contractors digging in the road or repairing other services. This allowed water to seep through the protective insulation layer causing the violent explosions.

On Wednesday, a manhole cover blew up in Piccadilly destroying a van parked on the side of the street as theatre goers were heading home.

One eyewitness Jon Hornbuckle Tweeted to say there had been numerous explosions and thick black smoke.

'That was scary, I was ten steps away and then BANG,' he wrote.

According to London Fire Brigade the manhole cover exploded and the fire spread to a nearby van.

Firemen attached a towline to the rear of the van and managed to pull it away from the source of the fire. One the van was a safe distance from the manhole cover, firemen extinguished the flames burning the vehicle.

A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'Crews worked quickly to deal with the fire, which was contained within ten minutes. The Brigade has attended one fire a week involving manhole covers this year.'

In total, twenty one firefighters from Soho and Lambeth dealt with the incident.

John Steed, the HSE's principal 
specialist inspector told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Last year when we 
recorded the increase, UK Power Networks sent off failed link boxes for 
examination and it was concluded moisture was the predominant cause.

'We 
called directors in, and we had a couple of meetings with them, and we 
made it very clear to them that we are expecting them to manage their 
assets a lot better, to carry out more inspections.'

A spokesman for UK Power Networks said: 'We believe more faults are being reported and recorded, but this does not necessarily mean there has been an increase.

'Last year was one of the wettest years on record, which may also be a factor, because occasionally water can seep into cables which have been damaged by third parties.'

UK Power Networks supplies electricity to eight million customers in London, the South East and East of England.

Colin Wingate was severely injured when a manhole cover exploded in Harrow, north-west London in August 2011.

He was confined to a wheelchair for three months following the blast.

He told the BBC: 'There was a huge - and when I say huge I mean enormous - explosion. Huge to the point that the iron manhole cover left the ground, I left the ground - and it was Bedlam."

He added: 'They are not doing enough to ensure that these accidents, incidents, call them what you like, don't happen anymore. Because sooner or later, at the rate these explosions are continuing, someone is going to lose their life.'
