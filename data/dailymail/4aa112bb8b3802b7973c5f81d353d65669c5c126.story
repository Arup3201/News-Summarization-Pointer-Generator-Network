Former rap mogul Marion 'Suge' Knight told a judge that he is suffering from blindness and other health complications moments before he was taken to hospital for the third time since he was charged with murder. 

Knight, 49, also told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Brandlin on Monday that he had fired attorneys handling his case and was receiving inadequate medical treatment in custody.

The Death Row Records co-founder, who wore glasses during the brief court appearance, said he was blind in one eye and had only about 15 percent vision in his other eye.

Constant treatment: It is the third time Knight has been transferred to hospital after he was taken into custody and charged with murder 

Knight said he was having difficulty comprehending the proceedings and told the judge he had been shot six times last year and had a blood clot in his lungs and other complications. He also said he had lost 35 pounds as a result of his injuries.

Brandlin transferred Knight's case to another judge, and he was taken for medical care before his case could be called in Judge Ronald Coen's courtroom. Coen said before calling the case that Knight had been taken to a hospital, but he did not elaborate.

On February 19, Knight was taken into medical care, complaining about stomach problems to a shooting in a nightclub last summer.

The music producer was earlier hospitalized on February 3 when he had a panic attack moments after pleading not guilty to all charges.

Armed guards reportedly watched over Knight in hospital. At the time it was reported that he had suffered a blood clot and had been given blood thinners.  

Knight has pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges after he struck two men with his truck, killing one, on Jan. 29. He remains held without bail.

Knight was out on bail in the separate robbery case at the time. His lawyer claimed that Knight was ambushed and feared for his life prior to the hit-and-run. 

Authorities allege Knight killed Terry Carter, 55, and injured another, Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, with his pickup truck near a film set in Compton, California. Police said he fled the scene.

It is believed to have been a result of an argument 30 minutes before between Knight and others on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton.'

Attorney David Kenner, who has represented Knight since the case was filed, told Coen that his client has been jailed too long and a hearing to set bail should be convened as soon as possible. Coen ordered another hearing for Knight on March 9.

Knight said he had fired Kenner and his law partner, telling Brandlin, 'I fired these lawyers.' 

He repeatedly tried to speak during the hearing in Brandlin's courtroom, but the judge admonished him not to interrupt. Knight said down and muttered an expletive while Brandlin quickly concluded the proceedings.

He wore orange jail attire and glasses during the hearing, and spoke while flanked by deputies.

Knight was shot six times at a nightclub in August. Within days of his release from the hospital, he was accused by a celebrity photographer of stealing her camera.
