Dom Inglot, the hulking British doubles specialist from Middlesex, caused a major upset in the Australian Open doubles when he and Romanian partner Florin Mergea ousted top seeds the Bryan brothers.

The 28 year-old from Chiswick, nicknamed Dom the Bomb due to his huge serve, scored the best win of his career when he knocked out the formidable Americans 7-6, 6-3 to reach the quarter finals.

Standing 6ft 5in, Inglot held firm as they broke the six-times champions and the world's outstanding pair twice in the match to pull off the shock after taking the tiebreak 7-4. Former Wimbledon junior champion Mergea kept his nerve in the final game to serve it out and they now meet Holland's Jean-Julien Rojer and Romania's Horia Tecau.

Inglot, coached by another Brit in Nick Cavaday, may have given Davis Cup captain Leon Smith exactly the kind of headache he wants ahead of the World Group first round against the USA in Glasgow in March.

The world champion Bryans are sure to be the American doubles pairing there, and while Jamie Murray's fine early-season form has pushed him into contention Inglot could challenge him with this victory under his belt.

The Bryans have won the Australian Open six times, but could not combat the combination of Inglot's power game and the solid rallying skills of the more diminutive Romanian from the baseline.

Inglot and Mergea, who needed to recover from 1-4 down in the first set, are playing only their seventh tournament together after teaming up following the US Open. Inglot, who had broken up with his long-term partner Treat Huey, asked the Romanian for the number of Portugal's Joao Sousa, and the Romanian suggested they try out as a pairing.

This was their most spectacular success to date: 'As a player the Bryans are the one team who you don't want to be near in the draw, you don't really want to play them. They know how to put pressure on and you have always got to beat them,' said Inglot. 'You have got to be aggressive and push hard against them, and that's what we did.

Inglot and Mergea came from 1-4 down in the first set to win in straight sets 

'If you leave the door ajar they will push through. Our coach Nick (brother of Naomi Cavaday) is very thorough and we were well prepared. Bob and Mike have certain places they like to return and we weren't going to give them what is their bread and butter.'

Of the Davis Cup he said: 'Leon likes to keep his cards close to his chest. I haven't spoken to him about this tie. I haven't played with Andy and maybe he would feel like he knows what he is going to get with his brother. I would love to play and if Leon calls me that's great but for now I'm focussed on here.'
