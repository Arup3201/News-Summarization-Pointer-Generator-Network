He is the British Prime Minister who liked his martinis as dry as dust and famously said the way to get it right was to simply look at the vermouth bottle while pouring the gin.

And now, to honour Winston’s upcoming birthday, The Churchill Bar & Terrace has created a martini in his honour – with a very unusual ingredient.

The cocktail includes moisture extracted from the walls of his War Rooms, the underground complex in which he lived during the Blitz.

Vintage drink: Sir Winston Churchill loved a good martini and to celebrate his birthday, one bar has unveiled a cocktail in his honour - and they've used the moisture from the walls of the Churchill War Rooms to make it extra authentic

The signature ingredient of the War Rooms Martini is the Robin Collective's Churchill Historical Bitters, which is infused with essence sucked out of the walls using a device similar to a dehumidifier.

The bitters are expertly blended with the Churchill Bar's own Churchill Craft Gin, which is heavy in juniper and citrus.

The £15 drink has been created by 
members of the Experimental Food Society and is being served next 
month at the bar within the Hyatt Regency London to mark the great 
British icon's birthday on November 30.

The tipple is served in an antique martini glass and garnished with a gin-washed baby beetroot, which makers claim gives it an earthy flavour that deepens in taste and colour as the beetroot infuses the drink.

The Churchill Bar & Terrace's Bar Manager, Alan B, hopes the cocktail will offer patrons the chance to raise their glass to the great British icon who led Britain to victory in World War II.

The Churchill Bar & Terrace was designed with a young Winston and his beloved wife Clementine in mind.

It is home to an elegant library curated by local specialist booksellers - Daunt Books – and features a range of works Churchill and Clementine might have enjoyed.

Newly launched, the Churchill Historical Bitters are the third in a series created by The Robin Collective that have seen them painstakingly extract essences from the residences of some of Britain's most loved personalities.

Each is blended with a range of ingredients inspired by different aspects of the particular icon's life.

The Churchill Historical Bitters feature cigar tobacco, British orchard fruits, berries and nuts and numerous other botanicals including liquorice root, black walnut leaf, mustard, gentian root, grains of paradise and rosehip to represent the roses that Churchill's beloved wife Clementine sent to him every day.

The team recently created a bitter to pay tribute to Scottish physician and writer, Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes.

They extracted moisture from his central London office in Barts Pathology Museum, where he reportedly wrote the fictional series.

Next on the agenda is a Charles Dickens bitter, which they will obtain from the walls of his former home, now a museum.

History - and alcohol - fans will be able to get their hands on The Churchill Historical Bitters at the Experimental Food Society Spectacular at the Old Truman Brewery on Friday 8 and Saturday 9 November.
