These never-before-seen images show how the childhood friends of African American photographer Gordon Parks ended up 20 years after being school in segregated Kansas.

Parks, then 38, took the images after being assigned by Life magazine to find his classmates, with whom he was educated in Fort Scott, Kansas.

He found that almost everybody had moved out of town. One poignant image from Fort Scott shows a young black couple outside a movie theater they couldn't enter due to segregation laws.

Unveiled: The old Gordon Parks photographs were commissioned in 1950 and saw the photographer return to his hometown of Fort Scott, Kansas. Above, a black couple are seen outside a segregated movie theater they could not go inside

Homely: The pictures are being exhibited in Boston. According to the exhibit's curator, Karen Haas, the images are remarkable in showing black families in proud, domestic situations - often in front of their houses, such as this one in Chicago

Karen Haas, the Lane Curator of Photographs at MFA Boston, who is curating the images in a new exhibition, explained that showing African American subjects in a normal, dignified situation was revolutionary. 

She told Slate: 'This was a time when it would have been difficult for an African-American citizen walking down the street to look a white person directly in the eye on the sidewalk. Here, they’re being invited to look into the camera. I find their gazes incredibly stirring because they’re so strong.'

The finished feature, which was set to appear in a 1950 issue of life, then a 1951 edition, but was ultimately left on the shelf for reasons which remain unclear.

Casual: The images show families of Parks's classmates in relaxed positions, such as this couple posing with a child in Columbus, Ohio

Respectable: According to Haas, the images would have been a surprise for many of Life's mostly-white readership, were they published. Above, a husband and wife walk through Detroit on a Sunday morning

Real life: The images, which were slated for 1950 then 1951 publication but ultimately shelved, differ from contemporary depictions of African Americans. The above image is from Fort Scott, where hardly any of Parks's classmates had stayed
