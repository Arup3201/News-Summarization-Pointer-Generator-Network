Fresh agony: Convicted murderer Joshua Komisarjevsky's attorney said his client is contemplating asking for a new trial

A convicted killer who held the Petit family hostage before murdering the mother and two daughters may ask for a new trial, his attorney said on Tuesday.

Joshua Komisarjevsky is on death row after Jennifer Hawke-Petit was raped and 
strangled to death and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, were
 tied to their beds and died when the house in Cheshire, Connecticut was set alight 
on July 23, 2007.

The girls' father Dr William Petit was the only survivor who managed to escape the flames after being beaten and tied up.

Attorney Walter Bansley told courant.com this week that his client may seek a new trial because he was unaware of the existence of the 911 calls.

Some of the calls, posted online by the Hartford Courant, revealed that Connecticut police decided against 
sending a hostage negotiator to the Petit family home on that fateful morning and told a SWAT team to hold back.

Mr Bansley told the newspaper: 'There is no doubt that if we were aware of those calls we would have tried to use them at trial and it would have made for a different defense.'

The defense attorney said that he is discussing whether the information creates grounds for a new trial along with lawyers handling Komisarjevsky's death sentence appeal.

Mr Bansley said that the failure to turn over evidence in a death-penalty trial - where the judge allows almost everything to be included - is a 'big legal issue'. 

Komisarjevsky and accomplice Stephen Hayes were sentenced to death in 2011 for the murders.

On the sixth anniversary of the 
horrific killings, the Hartford Courant published calls from law enforcement sources showing that officers with the Cheshire 
Police Department doubted the danger underway at the household.

Torn apart: William Petit, right, was the only member of the family to escape alive. Jennifer Hawke-Petit was strangled and their daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, were killed in the flames

They were also outside the home when the murders were carried out and before the home was burned to the ground, it has emerged.

Facing death: Stephen Hayes was convicted of triple murder in 2011 and is set to be executed

Police were first alerted to trouble at the house when Hawke-Petit was taken to a Bank of America and forced to withdraw $15,000, where she told the teller she was being held hostage.

When a police officer went to the bank 23 
minutes after the initial 911 call, he told a dispatcher in a recorded 
phone call that he doubted the accuracy of Hawke-Petit's story.

'She came into the bank, she tried to get some money out,' Lt James Fasano told the dispatcher.

'One of the accounts was in her husband's name, and then she says, "Well, my kids are at home tied up". So we don't know if they really are or if she was just trying to get money out at this point.'

He added that she had entered the bank alone and appeared calm, and that her captor had said nothing would happen to her as long as she handed over the money.

The phone calls also include one in which a hostage negotiator Eric Granoth is told he was not 
needed at the scene. 

'I need to know whether you want me in or
 not,' he said in a 15-second conversation with dispatcher Donald Miller. 'I am the hostage negotiator and I got paged.'

Miller then asked Deputy Chief 
Joseph Popovich if he wanted the negotiator, and Miller can be heard telling Granoth 'not at this time' before hanging up.

Crime scene: The killers broke into this home in Cheshire and held the family hostage - but the police told a hostage negotiator not to report to the home. Authorities have not explained why

New Haven Public Defender Thomas Ullmann, who represented Hayes, said: 'The fact that a 
hostage negotiator, listening to what was going on during the dispatch 
communications, felt compelled to call central police headquarters 
offering his assistance and then being turned away is shocking.'

Miller then received a call from SWAT team member Kerry Nastri, who asks whether they should start suiting up and head to the scene - but Miller said officers said they would call on them if they were needed.

Ten minutes later, Nastri called back to say they were going there anyway.

Also shocking is how the police have never performed a review of the incident.

Town Manager Michael Milone would not 
provide a reason for this, nor one for why the hostage negotiator was 
told not to go to the home.

Looking forward: Five years after losing his family, Dr Petit married Christine Paluf last year

Cindy Renn, Jennifer Hawke-Petit's 
sister, told the Courant that authorities have never carried out a 
review of the incident or their actions.

'Nobody
 in that department ever looked at what they did or didn't do right or 
wrong,' Renn said.

'Admit when you make mistakes and do better the next 
time and save people's lives.'

An HBO documentary that aired on Monday included a timeline that placed police at the house before Hawke-Petit was raped or the house was set on fire.
