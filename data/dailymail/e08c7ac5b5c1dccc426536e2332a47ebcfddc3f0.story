Tragic: Dylan Walker, from Mexborough, South Yorkshire, was a passenger in a car that crashed

A four-year-old boy who was killed in a car crash just two days before Christmas has been named by police.

Dylan Walker, of Mexborough, South Yorkshire, was a passenger in a white Mazda MX-5 when it was involved in a crash with an Iveco-Ford lorry at 11.35am on December 23.

A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said the youngster's family were 'struggling to come to terms with Dylan's death'.

A Facebook page has been set up in memory of the youngster and people have been posting their messages of condolence.

One mother, Laura Ramsden, wrote: 'I didn't even know this little boy or mum and dad but was heartbroken to see he has passed away. Christmas morning when my kids were opening their presents my thoughts were with you.

'Fly high with the stars little angel, and all my love to the family for this tragic loss my heart goes out to you xxx'

Another, Jayne Sloan, wrote: 'I drive past where it happened many times through the day for my work, although I was not there at the time.

'I have laid some flowers and a little toy action man where people have laid theirs and I just wanted to say that even though many people, like me, do not know the family our hearts and condolences are with them....R.I.P little guy, you're an angel now xxx'

Police said the driver of the car - a 51-year-old Doncaster man - suffered slight injuries in the collision.

The lorry driver, a 49-year-old man from Doncaster, escaped unharmed.

'Heartbroken': Friends wrote their condolences to Dylan's family on a Facebook page set up in memory of him

The emergency serives closed the road for several hours after the crash and a police probe into the circumstances surrounding the collision is under way.

Local newspaper the Star reports there was a crash at the same site in November in which a 15-year-old girl was left with serious injuries. The Ford Fiesta she was a passenger in hit a stone wall.

Officers investigating want to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident.

The coroner has been informed of the death and an inquest is to be held.

Anyone with information about the crash is asked to call South Yorkshire Police on 101.
