Britain's elderly should be allowed to choose how to die, 'with a nice glass of whisky and a pleasing pill,' writer Dame Margaret Drabble said

Britain's elderly should be allowed to choose how to die, ‘with a nice glass of whisky and a pleasing pill,’ writer Dame Margaret Drabble said yesterday.

She claimed it was grotesque to refuse assisted suicide for the terminally or incurably ill and that medical advances artificially prolonged life.

Allowing assisted suicide would mean doctors could help people to die without fear of prosecution, she said.

Writing in The Guardian, Dame Margaret, 74, said: ‘Many of us feel gravely disappointed by the help and relief on offer at the end of life.

'We want a change in the law concerning assisted dying and voluntary euthanasia, and help to die with dignity.’ 

Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill would enable the terminally ill to be prescribed a fatal dose of drugs but critics argued the proposal would be a ‘blank cheque’ for euthanasia and could lead to abuses.

Lord Falconer’s assisted dying bill would enable terminally ill patients with no more than six months to live to be prescribed a fatal dose of drugs, if they can show they have a ‘clear and settled intention’ to end their lives.

Supporters say it offers a humane end to life for patients with a terminal diagnosis, although it does not address dementia or patients with a longer-term chronic condition.

But critics, including several senior peers, have argued the proposal would be a ‘blank cheque’ for euthanasia and a threat to public safety as it could be abused.

Dame Margaret, whose biographer husband Sir Michael Holroyd is a patron of the campaign group Dignity in Dying, said she feared doctors would not allow him to die in peace, despite his well-publicised wishes.

Sir Michael, 78, who underwent successful treatment for bowel cancer in 2005, supports a change in the law to enable people to legally register a wish for help to die, should they need it.

Dame Margaret is the latest in a series of writers to call for assisted dying legislation.

Novelist Martin Amis prompted a storm when he suggested suicide booths on every street corner where pensioners could end their lives with ‘a martini and a medal’, and writer Will Self has argued that society must change its attitude to suicide, saying he expected to kill himself.
