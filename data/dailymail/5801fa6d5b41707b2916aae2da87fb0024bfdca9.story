Stevan Jovetic and Sergio Aguero tormented Liverpool as Manchester City made a bold early statement in title race.

As Mario Balotelli watched on from the Directors’ Box, Brendan Rodgers will have been left to wonder whether his new £16million signing will lift Liverpool to City’s level.

Jovetic scored either side of half-time to take the game away from Liverpool, with substitute Sergio Aguero coming off the bench to finish Liverpool off with his first touch, as City ran out convincing 3-1 winners at The Etihad Stadium.

Injuries ruined Jovetic’s first season in Manchester but he has come back this season in good heart, thriving during City’s pre-season tour. It led Manuel Pellegrini to hail the Montenegrin’s performance and the manager insisted he will play a major role in City’s quest for honours this season.

Pellegrini said: ‘We are pleased with Stevan, he is working hard. He was unlucky last season but we never had any doubt of his quality. He deserved to start the season as he has done. We need four strikers and at this moment Stevan is doing really well.

‘We don’t forget Alvaro Negredo, who was important last year but is injured. It is important that we have four strikers. When you play at home it is very important to play well against a team like Liverpool. They will be challenging for the title.

Pellegrini, who insisted that the injury which forced Edin Dzeko off was nothing too serious, added: ‘We are just starting the season we had a very hard start and it was very important for us to win the second game.

'For me these are games of six points – especially when you play at home. For Jovetic to start the season in this way after an unlucky new season is good’

Rodgers, whose side pulled back a late consolation when Pablo Zabaleta put past Joe Hart under pressure from Rickie Lambert, accepts signing Balotelli is 'a calculated risk' and has warned the 24-year-old this is his last chance to thrive at elite level.

But the Liverpool manager, while irked by some of his team’s defending, does not believe this was setback will be too costly. He warned, though, that the club’s £117million spending spree is no guarantee that they will be successful.

‘I think that the market for strikers of that quality (is tough) and the deal was very good,’ said Rodgers. ‘He is a world class talent and it is an area that we needed to strengthen. Hopefully we can help him improve as a player and a man. I think he can do very well for us.

‘I don’t have any concerns. We know he is a football talent. There is no big-time Charlies in this squad. He knows that he needs to fit in to this squad. One thing he doesn’t lack is confidence. He has that football arrogance. Luis has gone, he brilliant for me for two years but we move on.

‘I have been very encouraged by him. He knows he has got flaws. There is no better club. Liverpool is a wonderful club. He has already sampled how we work. The goals we are disappointed with. The first one we were not alert. You have to complement their finishing.

Rodgers added: ‘You buy players but it does not guarantee you anything. I thought up until they scored we were the better side. We looked good going forward. But we switched off before half-time. We started the second half reasonably bright but then gave away poor goals.

‘For the new players, it should be reasonable quick. There is a period of adaptation. We have still got the core and the players will adapt in. It will take a bit of time. Alberto Moreno showed flashes of his quality. We knew there were areas we need to work on. Markovic showed his pace and his quality’
