Samuel Lee Bassett is accused of punching a cop after police stopped him from running into his house

A Chicago man has been arrested after he repeatedly tried to run into his burning house and save his beloved dog from a fire.

Police say that Samuel Lee Bassett lashed out and punched an officer after cops handcuffed and restrained him when he wouldn't stop trying to run into the blaze on Friday afternoon at his home in Chicago's Morgan Park neighborhood.  

Three firefighters became trapped in the basement and had to be hospitalized while battling the intense fire. 

Bassett's dog died in the blaze. 

The Chicago Tribune reports that Bassett, a 48-year-old US Air Force veteran, wasn't home when the fire broke out. He returned to find his home fully engulfed in flames with firefighters already inside. 

He frantically tried to get inside his house to save his dog, firefighters said, and resisted their attempts to keep him away from the blaze. 

When police handcuffed and detained Bassett, he allegedly punched one of the officers in the face, leaving a cut on the bridge of his nose.

Officers responded by hitting him in the face with a pair of handcuffs, the Tribune reports. 

He is charged with resisting the police and two counts of felony aggravated battery on a police officer. 

A judge ordered him held on $300,000 bail. 

Three firefighters became trapped after getting lost and disoriented in the basement of the home while battling the blaze. 

They were taken to the hospital with minor injuries after being rescued. 

Bassett, who works as a lighting designer, posted a Facebook photo from his Air Force days showing him in uniform with a German shepherd. On it, he wrote 'me and my best friend.'

Bassett, 48, posted this picture of him and a German shepherd form his days serving in the US Air Force. On the caption he wrote, 'me and my best friend'
