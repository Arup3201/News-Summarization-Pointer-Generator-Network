A video interview with Jerry Sandusky in 1987 offers a disturbing look into the earlier mind of the man now charged with 40 counts of sexual assault after sexually abusing at least eight young boys.

The former defensive line coach for Penn State University's football team was at the height of his career when he was interviewed by NBC news, talking about the charity he formed to help underprivileged youth.

Now, in light of the scandal that broke last Saturday, it is confirmed that he used that same charity as a way to pick his victims.

Behind the smile: Jerry Sandusky was interviewed by NBC in October 1987, ten years after starting his charity

Connected: Sandusky's name was inherently connected to Penn State and his coaching role made him a local hero

'I enjoy being around children,' he said, smiling.

'I enjoy their enthusiasm. I just have a good time with them.'

Sandusky created The Second Mile as a charity to help underprivileged Pennsylvania youth, often in need of foster homes. The court report filed against Sandusky says the self-described mission of the charity was to 'help children who need additional support and would benefit from positive human interaction'.

Sandusky was very much the head of the program until he retired last year, and was the emotional leader of the organization, respected and admired by the children as a fatherly figure both because of his charity and because of his position in the Penn State football program.

Founder: Sandusky created The Second Mile in 1977 and now it is known that is where he chose his victims

'One of the biggest things would be the trust that would developed,' he said of his goals for the program.

'What we're trying to be is, what we think to be of, is a true friend.

'Everybody needs people to care for them.'

He alludes to his role as a disciplinarian as well, which has an underlying message after having read the court reports which describe his sexual interactions with unwilling young boys.

'Sometimes they don't want it, sometimes they don't understand what you're trying to do but they want to be disciplined,' he said. 'Kids are growing up awfully fast today.'

Resigned: Jack Raykovitz, former CEO of The Second Mile, resigned amid allegations that Sandusky found his victims through the organization

The damage of the allegations continues 
to spread as the charity announced Sunday that Dr. Jack Raykovitz, who 
has served as the CEO of The Second Mile for the past 28 years, 
resigned, saying that he and the board of directors felt it was in 'the 
best interest' of the organization.

This old interview and the removal of Mr Raykovitz from The Second Mile comes just as one of Sandusky's victims hired an attorney to pursue a civil suit against anyone who potentially knew about the abuse and did nothing.

The lawyer, Ben Andreozzi, represents 
one of the unnamed victims and would not give any clues as to which one,
but said that his client is 'torn up' about the entire situation.

'It's
important to understand that these folks were involved in the Penn 
State football community,' Mr Andreozzi said in an interview with the 
Today Show.

'They were on 
the sidelines of football games, they were spending significant amounts 
of time travelling with the team and or in the locker room with the team
and getting to know members of that football team. to say that he's 
torn apart would be an emotion would really explain where he's at right 
now,' he continued.

Because of the victims close ties to Penn State, and really the town of State College as a whole, the ripple effects of the scandal are hard for Mr Andreozzi's client to handle.

'The general public may think that an abuse victim in his position would automatically have feelings of negativity towards the university and while I think he's very disappointed in the way that members of the University community handled his situation or the situation involving the cove rup, it's a complex issue and we need to understand that he has a variety of thoughts going through his head right now,' Mr Andreozzi said.

The civil suit is the first of its kind in this scandal, as so far Sandusky and two other university administrators have only been criminally charged.

Disturbing: 'Sometimes they don't want it, sometimes they don't understand what you're trying to do but they want to be disciplined,' he said in the 1987 interview

Tom Corbett, the governor of Pennsylvania, thinks that this is not the end of the case either and he expects more victims to come forward now that the incidents are public.

'When the word gets out, when people understand that authorities are actually doing something about this, that they may be believed, then more people come forward, Mr Corbett said to Fox News Sunday. "

'If I had to speculate I wouldn't be surprised if we had more victims come forward.'
