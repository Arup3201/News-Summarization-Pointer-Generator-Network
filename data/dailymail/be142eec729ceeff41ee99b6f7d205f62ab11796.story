Bacary Sagna and his wife are enjoying a sun-soaked trip to Miami Beach, as he prepares to take his footballing skills to a new club.

The former Arsenal defender was spotted on the balmy Florida shores with his stunning wife Ludivine as they relaxed on the beach.

Sagna joined Premier League champions Manchester City at the end of his Arsenal contract putting an end to months of speculation about his future.

Time out: Manchester City defender Bacary Sagna and wife Ludivine relax in Miami after a long season

Resolved: After a long contract stand-off with Arsenal, Sagna departed the club to join City

Take a break: Since resolving his future, Sagna has holidayed in Miami with wife Ludivine

Recuperating: City have already begun their pre-season but Sagna is on break due to playing in the World Cup

The France
 international will compete with Pablo Zabaleta for a spot in Manuel 
Pellegrini's side, but both men are on extended summer breaks after 
their World Cup exploits.

Sagna
 helped Les Bleus reach the World Cup quarter-finals where they lost to 
Germany, while Zabaleta's Argentina reached the final where they also 
succumbed to the Germans.

Bacary
 agreed to join City on a £150,000-a-week deal with Manchester City 
after eight years with the Gunners, but denies he left for financial 
reasons.

'I’m going to clear everything up because I keep reading that I did it for money and I’m greedy,' he said.

'What I want to say is I have stayed with Arsenal on the same contract since 2008 and I never asked for more money.

'For
 people who think it’s for money, it’s not. I just wanted to change. I 
needed a boost in my career and I think it was about time.

'It
 was not an easy time because we were still involved in the FA Cup and 
it was hard to stay focused. I stayed focused on my team because I have a
 lot of respect for Arsenal.’

Happy ending: Sagna ended his seven-year spell at Arsenal with silverware by winning the FA Cup

Les Bleus: Sagna represented France at the 2014 World Cup where they reached the quarter-finals
