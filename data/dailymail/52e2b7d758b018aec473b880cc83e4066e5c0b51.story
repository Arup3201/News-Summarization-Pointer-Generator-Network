Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that some of the information that was used to locate and kill Osama bin Laden was attained using torture.

The admission comes after months of speculation about the role that waterboarding plays in CIA interrogations following its graphic depiction in the Oscar-nominated film Zero Dark Thirty.

'In order to put the puzzle of intelligence together that led us to Bin Laden, there were a lot of pieces out there that were a part of that puzzle. Yes, some of it came from some of the tactics that were used at that time, interrogation tactics that were used,’ Panetta said Sunday during an appearance on Meet The Press.

'But the fact is we put together most of that intelligence without having to resort to that.

'First of all, it’s a movie, let's remember that. I lived the real story with the Bin Laden operation.’

This is not the first time that Panetta, who is portrayed by James Gondolfini in the controversial film, has admitted that American investigators were aided by the information gathered using torture.  

Even in the months prior to the release of the film in December, many were raising concerns about the graphic torture scene that takes up much of the first fifteen minutes of the movie.

Dianne Feinstein, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, says that the interrogation of Bin Laden's courier, who then led U.S. military teams to the Al Qaeda leader's compound, did not involve any waterboarding.

That particular questioning session was key to the case, as American authorities then trailed the courier who lead them to Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, but Feinstein told The New Yorker that waterboarding was not used during the interrogation of the man.

Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal counter her claim without giving any specific details, saying that the film is based fully on first-hand accounts of the years of investigations.

Their response to Feinstein's claims, however, gave a bit more room for creative license.

'It’s a movie, not a documentary,' Boal told The New Yorker.

Waterboarding is a controversial torture tactic that has been used been used by the CIA in their interrogation of terror suspects.

The specifics of the tactics differ, but in most cases a cloth or plastic wrap is put over the suspect's face and then the agent proceeds to tour water on their head.

It is thought to simulate drowning, and the bound suspect fears that their are about to die.

The official stance on it's use has varied over the years, though the CIA has publicly confirmed that they have used the technique on at least three al Qaeda operatives, including self-proclaimed '9/11 mastermind' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

'We’re trying to make the point that waterboarding and other harsh tactics were part of the C.I.A. program.'

Another criticism of the film was that
 Bigelow and Boal (both of The Hurt Locker fame) received special 
treatment by the Obama administration during the production stages of 
the film, but both have denied such claims.

'It was all based on first hands 
accounts so it really felt very vivid and very vital and very, very 
immediate and visceral of course which is very exciting as a film 
maker,' Bigelow said without revealing any specific sources.

For the director, the jarring waterboarding scenes were the most difficult to film.

‘I wish that it wasn't a part of history, but it is and was,’ she said.
