We are constantly being nagged to floss, with dental experts  claiming it can add years to our life.

But according to one dentist, most of us have been doing it incorrectly for years.

Dr Carlos Meulener, a  dentist from New Jersey, has released a video showing the best way to floss teeth in order to have the healthiest smile. 

‘Brushing is great but it’s not enough - you need flossing to remove the bacteria between the teeth,’ he says. 

Dr Calos Meulener has released a video showing his 'one minute flossing technique' which he says helps rid the mouth of bacteria. He is pictured holding floss between two thumbs, about an inch apart

He advises taking a piece of wax dental floss and winding it up with the index fingers, but not so tightly that it hurts.

When flossing the upper row of teeth, put the thumbs around an inch apart from each other on the floss.

Dr Meulener said: ‘The reason why most people have a problem flossing is that they try to get too much floss in their mouths.

‘The way to control it is to use your thumbs for your upper teeth and middle fingers for your lower teeth.

‘Put that amount of floss between these fingers so you can manipulate it easily from one side to the next.’

Then, put the floss between two teeth and floss in and up and down motion along the teeth, rather than a sawing motion from side to side.

1. Take a piece of wax dental floss and put each thumb about and inch apart

2. Put the floss between the upper teeth

3. Keeping the back thumb stationary, move the front thumb up and down to floss the tooth

4. Do not floss in a 'sawing motion' - back and forth - but up and down, rubbing the floss up and down the tooth

5. Repeat using the middle fingers for the bottom teeth 

‘We’re flossing the walls of one tooth and the other tooth and polishing the bacteria off those surfaces,’ Dr Meulener said.

One thumb should stay stationary while the other thumb is moved up and down, creating the flossing motion.

Similarly, when flossing the lower teeth, one middle finger should stay stationary while the other is moved, it in order to manipulate the floss so it rubs up and down against the inside of the tooth.

Dr Meulener says this method, which takes just a minute, is the best and most efficient way to floss.

He said: ‘It takes a minute and it really makes a difference to dental health.’

In the past, studies have shown that flossing teeth can prevent the build up of plaque, which sticks to teeth and causes irritation, inflammation to gums known as gum disease.

Gum disease causes bad breath, bleeding gums and, if untreated, cavities, receding gums and tooth loss.

Worldwide, 15- 20 per cent of adults aged 35-44 years have severe gum disease, which may result in the loss of teeth.

He advises using two thumbs for the upper teeth, or two middle fingers for the lower teeth, and flossing in an 'up and down' motion rather than 'sawing' from side to side

In the UK, the The Adult Dental Health Survey of 2009 found 47 per cent of  the population had moderate to severe gum disease - around 30 million people.

Research shows losing teeth could signal a higher risk of suffering heart disease and diabetes.

Swedish researchers found people with fewer teeth and bleeding gums were more likely to have a range of cardiovascular problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

They found poor dental hygiene and bleeding gums could allow up to 700 different types of bacteria to get into the bloodstream, which increases the risk of a heart attack regardless of how fit and healthy the person is. 

Previous studies have also linked bad teeth to Alzheimer's, heart disease, strokes, diabetes, lung disease and even miscarriage and premature birth.
