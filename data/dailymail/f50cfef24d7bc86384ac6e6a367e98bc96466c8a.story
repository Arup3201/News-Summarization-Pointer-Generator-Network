Sunderland vs West Ham United (Stadium of Light) 

Team news

Sunderland

Steven Fletcher could return to the Sunderland starting line-up for Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with West Ham at the Stadium of Light.

Fletcher was an unused substitute in last week's goalless draw at Liverpool after limping off during the defeat to Manchester City with a back injury, but is fit to return.

Sebastian Coates is available again after being ineligible for the trip to Anfield, but Emanuele Giaccherini (ankle) and Billy Jones (hamstring) are both still ruled out.

Provisional squad: Pantilimon, Mannone, Reveillere, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Coates, Cattermole, Rodwell, Bridcutt, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Alvarez, Mavrias, Fletcher, Wickham, Altidore.

West Ham United

West Ham midfielder Mark Noble is Sam Allardyce's only injury concern for the Barclays Premier League trip to Sunderland on Saturday.

The 27-year-old recently broke the record for Premier League appearances for a Hammers player but will not add to his tally due to a problem with his Achilles tendon.

Allardyce has a selection headache in attack with Andy Carroll, Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho, Carlton Cole and Mauro Zarate all fully fit and in contention to feature against the Black Cats.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, O'Brien, Reid, Tomkins, Collins, Jenkinson, Kouyate, Song, Nolan, Amalfitano, Downing, Jarvis, Vaz Te, Zarate, Carroll, Sakho, Valencia, Cole
