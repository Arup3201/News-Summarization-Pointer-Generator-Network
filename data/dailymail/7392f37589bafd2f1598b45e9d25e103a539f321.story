Nigel Pearson is confident Leicester City will be able to obtain a work permit for new £9million signing Andrej Kramaric - because Chelsea launched a bid too.

The Premier League’s bottom club will need to win their case on appeal as the Croatia striker does not meet current criteria, but Pearson thinks the high-level interest in him provides a strong argument.

Kramaric, 23, has scored 28 goals this season for Croatian team Rijeka this term and found the net twice in his five international appearances.

‘It would be fair to say he has a very bright future and hopefully that will be taken into consideration,’ said Pearson. 

‘The very fact there has been interest from some very big clubs would be significant in the sense that he is a player who is rated domestically and certainly across Europe.

'I think we have a pretty strong case with his international status and his form, internationally and at club level. He has represented Croatia at every level.

'It is never easy to get these situations finalised but I have been very impressed with him as a person and I think he will be a very important signing for us. It speaks volumes for the lad that he is prepared to come to us in our own situation.'

Chelsea had looked to be edging ahead in the race for Kramaric’s signature before the Premier league leaders were unable to guarantee him a place in their squad next season. Pearson hopes Kramaric can fire the goals that get Leicester to safety.

'He is a player we have had on the radar for a while,’ he said. 'It is really important for us to strengthen. Clearly his goalscoring record speaks for itself. He has good energy levels. It is just a very important signing for us.’

As the Foxes await news on the Kramaric deal, the club have re-opened talks with Mainz over striker Shinji Okazaki.

Sportsmail revealed this week that Leicester had made an £8million offer for the Japan international but Mainz want £10million.

Leicester have been rebuffed in other bids for Shaun Maloney at Wigan Athletic and Danny Ings at Burnley while Jermain Defoe is awaiting other offers.

Leicester have also re-opened talks with Shinji Okazaki (right), here playing for Japan against Auckland City during an Asian Cup warm-up match in Cessnock, Australia

Okazaki said: ‘I haven’t heard all the details personally and I am not overvaluing myself but obviously it is nice to get that kind of offer. It has been a dream of mine since my youth to play in the Premier League and I have been watching the Premier League since I turned pro.

‘I am not saying that the level is higher than the Bundesliga but the leagues have a different kind of quality and different culture.’ 

Okazaki is in Australia ahead of Japan's defence of the Asian Cup alongside AC Milan's Keisuke Honda and Borussia Dortmund's Shinji Kagawa,
