One of the largest-ever security operations will be mounted on the Thames today – with 6,000 police and 7,000 stewards on call to protect the Royal Family.

At its heart will be the barge carrying the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

They will be protected by Royal Navy vessels, marines and armed police in speed boats.

Scotland Yard has committed all 21 of its patrol craft along with a further two from Essex Police.

SAS teams will also operate from the riverside.

The operation is bigger than last year’s Royal Wedding.

Measures have been drawn up to combat potential threats from Al Qaeda-inspired extremists, dissident Irish republican terrorists, anarchists and even lone stalkers.  

More than 30,000 individual security checks have been carried out  on flotilla participants and anyone with access to boats and bridges.
