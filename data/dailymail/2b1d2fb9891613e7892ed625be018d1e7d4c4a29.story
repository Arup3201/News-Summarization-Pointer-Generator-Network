A Facebook post castigating Alaska Airlines for shoddy customer service toward an elderly man stricken with late-stage Parkinson's Disease has gone viral on the Web - and engendered a backlash against the company.

Cameron Clark unwittingly incited the furor on Friday with a Facebook post labeling the Alaska Airlines personnel involved in the matter 'the worst of humanity.'

The longtime Oregon concert promoter had witnessed Alaska Airlines workers repeatedly ignore an elderly, disabled man who was awaiting a flight at Oregon's Redmond Airport.

'The Worst of Humanity': Alaska Airlines faces a backlash from a Facebook post that went viral detailing poor customer service toward an elderly, disabled man

The man, who Clark said appeared to be in 70s, was flying to a long-awaited rendezvous with his daughter in Washington. He wound up missing the flight - even after Clark tried to intervene on his behalf.

'What happened to our 
collective sense of decency, of compassion, of our disposition to help 
those in need of extra help,' Clark later wrote in a post to his hundreds of Facebook friends.

'Alaska airlines. you broke a man's heart 
today. you maintained your policy, and ignored an opportunity to do the 
right thing. you broke my heart too.'

KTVZ in Central Oregon reports Clark's dramatic account of the incident spread quickly on the Web, and sparked a series of angry Facebook posts directed at Alaska Airlines.

Some posters urged the elderly man to sue the airline for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. Others vowed never to fly with the carrier again until it did right by all those involved, the television station reported.

For its part, the airline says employees did their best to accommodate the passenger.

Officials posted on Facebook that the man's ticket was refunded, and he boarded a new flight Saturday morning. A spokesman said the man never said he was disabled and airline employees, smelling alcohol, believed he was intoxicated.

collective sense of decency, of compassion, of our disposition to help 
those in need of extra help. Alaska airlines. you broke a man's heart 
today. you maintained your policy, and ignored an opportunity to do the 
right thing. you broke my heart too.

In his Facebook post, Clark said the man appeared to be in his 70s and told him that he missed a limited window of time he had to meet his daughter in Bellingham, Wash.

Clark told KTVZ that he never intended for his post to become viral, but that the many people who responded to the story 'show(s) that the best of humanity is alive and well. that light exists. that accountability is possible.'

The man never told airline employees that he had Parkinson's disease or any other disability, spokesman Paul McElroy reiterated to The Associated Press on Saturday. Officials believed he was intoxicated because they smelled alcohol.

'We are prohibited from asking customers if they have a disability, and the customer never told us that he had Parkinson's, or any disability for that matter,' McElroy said. 'He did appear disoriented to us, and later, when we smelled alcohol, we were led to the conclusion he was intoxicated.'

'We don't know whether this customer has
Parkinson's or not,' said McElroy, who added that the passenger has not
complained to the airline over the incident.

After hearing of the airline's response, Clark said he was troubled.

'I was closer to him than any of their employees,' he told KTVZ in a written statement after the fact. 'I stood right next to him for fifteen minutes, and we spoke to each other within inches of each other. I smelled absolutely nothing.

'It's unreal what they are doing now.'.
