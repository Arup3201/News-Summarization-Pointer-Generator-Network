A gardener has relived the horrific moment he nearly drowned on the Queen’s country estate in an accident with a lawnmower.

Lee Abel, 33, was cutting the grass at Sandringham when his machine slid down a grass verge into a lake, pinning him underwater for 10 minutes.

He was saved by royal protection officers Pcs Keith Hunt and Darren Wynne who pulled him out with head gardener Martin Woods.

They began CPR before paramedics arrived and Lee was taken to hospital in a coma when he spent a month after the accident last July.

It is understood the Queen was at Sandringham on a private visit less than an hour after the accident.

He still suffers from extreme fatigue and his three rescuers have been honoured with a bravery award.

Lee said: 'I can’t recall what happened at all. The first I knew about it was when I was told by friends and family in hospital.

'It was as if someone had told me a story and it was hard for me to recognise that it was actually about me.'

He added: 'They definitely should get an award for what they did for me.

'Everyone was just fantastic. They are all unbelievable. I owe them so much and it is so hard to describe how I feel.

'They were brilliant from the moment they saw the mower they just got in and hauled me out and started to resuscitate me.

'The air ambulance crew said they did an incredible job.'

The three rescuers were presented with a certificate of bravery and the two officers also received a Chief Constable’s Commendation.

Superintendent Kevin Clarke, head of royalty protection for Norfolk Constabulary, said: 'I am incredibly proud of PCs Wynne and Hunt for how they conducted themselves, and also the actions of Mr Woods.

'Their actions in rescuing Lee undoubtedly saved his life, and the fact that Lee was able to attend the evening to see all three receiving their awards was incredibly poignant and moving.'

An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive into the accident states that no health and safety issues were found in the management of the estate.

It is thought the machine rolled into the lake after the rear wheels lost traction on the grass.

Lower Lake is next to the Estate Office, also known as York Cottage. The converted house was the residence of King George V.

The lake, which is around 200m wide with an island in the middle, is the largest of four inter-connected lakes and ponds in the grounds of Sandringham House.
