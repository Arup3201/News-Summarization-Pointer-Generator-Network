Daniel Sturridge and his Liverpool team-mates were in jubilant mood as they took to a frosty Melwood training ground on Monday morning.

Following on from their 2-0 win against West Ham at Anfield on Saturday, Brendan Rodgers put his men through their paces as they look to work their way back into the Champions League places.

And it's no surprise Sturridge's beaming grin was on show for all to see after ending a five-month injury absence with a goal against the Hammers.

It took the England star just 11 minutes to get himself back on the scoresheet for the first time since the opening game of the season after he replaced Lazar Markovic. 

Sturridge's timely return will be a huge boost for the Reds, who have struggled in front of goal since the striker suffered a thigh injury on international duty in September.

Despite bringing in Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli over the summer, and recalling Fabio Borini from a season-long loan spell at Sunderland, the frontmen had managed just four Premier League goals this term.

With Sturridge back in the fold in such emphatic fashion, boss Rodgers will be hoping the England man can kickstart the campaign for the Merseyside club.

Rodgers is also still keen to land a deadline-day deal for Burnley striker Danny Ings however the Clarets have insisted the England Under 21 international will not be leaving before the window closes.

Sturridge's goal during his cameo against West Ham will likely put him back at the top of the pecking order
