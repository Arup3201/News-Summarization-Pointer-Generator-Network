Waste: Soldiers have been told to stop 'firing off' unused rounds of ammunition at the end of training exercises

Cash-strapped army officers have ordered soldiers to cut the amount of ammunition they use.

Bullets unused during training exercises must now be returned to stores to help save money, instead of being fired off by troops.

The army penny-pinching emerged as leaked documents showed the Ministry of Defence has wasted millions of pounds on a botched computer system.

The armed forces have been forced to save billions by cutting troop numbers, equipment budgets and deployments.

Now senior officers have told soldiers to stop the practice of firing off left over bullets at the end of training exercises, the Daily Telegraph reported.

One squaddie revealed in a letter to Soldier magazine revealed that despite the financial crisis faced by the military, officers still tell them to ‘start bombing up, we can’t take any ammo back' even when bullets are sealed in boxes.

Officers claim that it is ‘too much paperwork when we return them’ ‘it’s good training to feel what full automatic feels like’.

Lt Col Dom Cooper, of the Army’s ammunition management department, replied: ‘It is unfortunate that some unit personnel appear to have engaged in ammunition “firing off”.

‘Such behaviour is wasteful and there can be no excuse for it.’

The MoD said the ‘firing off’ Is ‘wasteful’ and has been banned.

But the ministry faced fresh criticism about waste over its bungled handling of an IT system to recuit thousands of new reservists and full-time personnel.

The Recruitment Partnering Project, a £1.3 billion scheme intended to enable the Army to recruit online, is almost two years behind schedule and will not be fully operational until April 2015 at the earliest, The Times said.

Up to £15.5 million has been spent on the computer system, but according to the newspaper, the problems are so serious that Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is considering spending nearly £50 million on a new solution.

According to a confidential report by technology research company Gartner, the Army's recruitment wing picked the wrong bidder to build the IT system after failing in 2011 to challenge an MoD policy that favoured the less suitable of two competing offers.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has been urged to get a grip on the bungled IT project which has already cost millions

The project management team was inexperienced and under-resourced and when delays started the Army failed to take charge and put in a suitable contingency plan.

Mr Hammond was being urged to pay Capita, the MoD's partner in the project, £47.7 million to build a new IT platform.

A briefing note sent from the MoD's director general finance David Williams to Mr Hammond in December recommended scrapping the flawed IT system and paying Capita to build its own model.

He wrote: ‘If the ICT hosting solution is not put in place then the MoD risks not gaining the appropriate number of recruits needed. Given recent criticism of army recruitment . . . and the use of reserves, this would lead to further negative media reporting and reputational damage for MoD.’

Another briefing note revealed that the MoD will incur additional costs of £1 million a month until the IT problem is resolved.

Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said: ‘This leaked report points to the latest series of catastrophic failures at the Ministry of Defence on David Cameron's watch.

The Army is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 while the newly-renamed Army Reserve - formerly the Territorial Army - is being expanded from 19,000 to 30,000

‘Labour warned that the Government was taking risks with Britain's security by not fixing the reserve recruitment crisis before reducing numbers in the regular Army. We specifically raised the worrying IT problems and Capita's performance as causes for concern. But the Government recklessly pressed ahead.

‘Now we learn that the problems were worse than anyone thought and still haven't been fixed. The blame for this latest fiasco - which is wasting £1m of taxpayers money every month - lies squarely with government.

‘Philip Hammond needs to get a grip and sort this shambles out.’

In a paper lodged in Parliament in December Mr Hammond said that recruitment in 2013 ‘has been well below historic levels’ and acknowledged there were problems with the IT system.

An MoD spokeswoman said: ‘In December last year we acknowledged a number of problems with the Army and Capita recruitment partnership. Ministers have gripped these problems and put in place a number of fixes to correct the issues that had emerged.

‘As we have previously said, in the medium-term we are building a new IT platform that will be ready early next year and in the short term we are introducing work-arounds and mitigation measures to the old IT platform to simplify the application process.

‘With an improved Army recruitment website, streamlined medicals and an increase in the number of recruiting staff, recruits should see a much improved experience at the end of this month.’
