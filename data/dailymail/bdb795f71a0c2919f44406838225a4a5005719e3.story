Two nurses and an orderly dragged a mentally disabled man from his bed and beat him so severely that he will be paralysed for life if he survives.

CCTV footage shows the horrific moment the hospital staff kicked Zhao Yanli in his bed, before pulling him onto the floor and stamping on his head.

The patient was then moved to the television room at the psychiatric hospital in the city of Shenyang in north-eastern China's Liaoning province where he was found by his brother, Cheng.

CCTV: Footage shows Zhao Yanli being kicked in his bed, before being dragged onto the floor and stamped on

Bruised: Zhao was found injured and barely conscious in the television room by his brother Cheng

'I asked where he was and they told me he was in the TV room,' Cheng said. 'When I went there I found him barely conscious and covered in bruises. He was in a really bad way.'

Zhao was immediately taken to the emergency ward at the local hospital but medics said there was little they could do for him. 

They said it appeared he is crippled and would probably never have the use of his legs again if he survived.

The footage was caught on a CCTV camera seized by police as part of an investigation into the horrific injuries that Zhao sustained.

It is believed the attack was in response to an offensive comment Zhao apparently made to a female nurse, which had offended her honour.

His family is now suing Shenyang People’s Military Psychiatric Hospital, not only for allowing the staff to beat the mentally disabled man so severely, but also for failing to alert them to the injuries, meaning they missed the opportunity to get him immediate medical attention.

The family complained to police shortly after taking him to hospital in November and officers subsequently raided the hospital and seized the CCTV footage.

Offensive: It is believed the attack was in response to an offensive comment Zhao apparently made to a nurse

At least 10 other people seem to be in the room. Although it is not known if these are staff or patients, it is clear none of them tried to protect the mentally ill patient. 

The family has hired a lawyer after refusing to accept the £37,000 in compensation offered by the hospital. They said they also want to see the staff prosecuted and jailed.

Cheng added: 'We put my beloved brother there because we wanted him to be well cared for in a way that we didn't have time for a home, and we were shocked to find this sort of abuse happening. 

'He is a good man who would never harm anybody, I can't believe he got a beating like this for apparently saying something rude to a female nurse.'
