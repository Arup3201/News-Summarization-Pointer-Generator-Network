Russian gay rights activists have condemned a St Petersburg law fining anyone who 'promotes homosexuality' as a way of 'keeping gay people off the streets'.

A bill has been passed in Russia's second largest city declaring that anyone who committed 'public acts' promoting homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgender issues could be fined up to 3,000 roubles (£61 approx).

However, the bill has given no clear definition of what a public act is, leading equality activists to claim the law is an an attempt to crack down and permanently ban gay pride events.

Targets: Despite homosexuality being decriminalised in Russia in 1993, gay rights groups are still targeted by right-wing protesters

Gay rights groups described the bill tentatively passed by St Petersburg lawmakers as a 'disgrace'.

The bill was passed by the dominant United Russia party with a majority of 27 to 1 on Wednesday.

The law could also see companies who 'promote homosexuality' fined between 10,000 and 50,000 roubles (around £1,000), according to technorati.com.

Nikolai Alexeyev of the GayRussia.ru group said the bill could become 'the main legal reason to deny any public actions by the LGBT community.'

He said: 'It theoretically allows the ban of anything anywhere where kids could be present.'

Homosexuality was decriminalized in Russia in 1993 and gay clubs operate in most big cities, but discrimination is still widespread.

Most attempts by Alexeyev's group to hold rallies have been thwarted by riot police and activists with Russia's dominant Orthodox Church and pro-Kremlin youth movements.

Gay rights demonstrations are not permitted in Moscow, whose mayor has called homosexuality 'satanic.'

In May 2007, former politician Peter Tatchell and pop singer Richard Fairbrass were punched and kicked by right-wing thugs while attempting to take part in a gay rights protest in Moscow.

Mr Fairbrass, 53, the Right Said Fred singer, was being interviewed on TV during the Moscow march when an anti-gay activist, dressed all in black, surged forward and began raining blows on his head and punched him full in the face.

Ex-politician Peter Tatchell was also attacked by homophobic Russian thugs while supporting gay rights

The attack left him with blood dripping from cuts around his eyes and nose.

Mr Tatchell, 55, was repeatedly beaten and kicked before being taken away by two riot policemen.

In August 2009, a lesbian couple kissed in protest outside a court in Russia, after a legal battle to decide whether they should be allowed to marry was postponed.
