Spurs claim him as one of their own. Arsenal fans beg to differ. But it is starting to get to the point now where, for the rest of football, it doesn’t really matter. Match by match, week by week, Harry Kane is announcing himself as the kind of talent who will soon belong to all of us.

Kane did not just score the two clinically taken goals that took Tottenham to victory over QPR at Loftus Road on Saturday and lifted them into the scrap for the Champions League places. He led the line with authority and verve. He was not only the best finisher; he was a constant source of creativity, too.

The England manager, Roy Hodgson, watched from the directors’ box and it must surely have reached the stage now where naming Kane in his squad for the forthcoming matches against Lithuania and Italy later this month is a formality.

Kane has not just knocked on Hodgson’s door. He has smashed straight through it.

The sub-plot in west London was that the Tottenham striker won his personal goalscoring duel with Charlie Austin. Kane has now scored in six consecutive away games for Spurs, whose victory took them to within three points of Manchester United, the side sitting uneasily in fourth place.

Kane’s 15th and 16th league goals of the season also lifted him above Austin in the goalscoring charts. Only Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa, of Chelsea, have scored more.

Austin did not do his own reputation any harm with another full-blooded performance brimming with threat and endeavour, but he could not prevent his team from being dragged deeper into the mire at the foot of the table. Austin crashed one left-footed shot off the underside of the bar, leaving Chris Ramsey ruing his side’s bad luck and complaining about two penalty decisions that did not go his way.

Even though QPR mounted a spirited late comeback, they were again undone by familiar defensive failings that leave them in danger of being cut adrift.

Defender Rio Ferdinand was singled out for particular criticism from disgruntled home supporters, but it was a collective failure at the back that undid Ramsey’s team.

‘We need to go away and regroup,’ the QPR head coach said.

Rangers had started the match well. Striker Bobby Zamora forced a flying save out of Hugo Lloris inside 60 seconds but referee Craig Pawson got his own afternoon off to a poor beginning by awarding a goal-kick.

Spurs soon shook off their uncertainty, though, and five minutes later Kane met a cross from Kyle Walker at the near post with a glancing header and brought a brilliant point-blank save out of Robert Green. This time, even Mr Pawson realised it was a corner.

The half sank into a stalemate until a defensive error by Walker almost allowed QPR to snatch the lead. The England full-back attempted a headed backpass but Austin saw it coming and intercepted it, turning it goalwards. Lloris got his hand to the ball and scrambled it clear. 

Even though Tottenham were dominating possession and Christian Eriksen was orchestrating play beautifully, the best chance of the half fell to QPR after half an hour.

Matt Phillips played the ball into the box and when it ran on to Austin, his left-footed rising drive beat Lloris but smashed against the underside of the bar and away to safety. On the QPR bench, Ramsey held his head in his hands.

All of QPR’s efforts were undone 10 minutes before half time when Andros Townsend floated a free kick into their box. None of the QPR defenders attacked the ball, Nedum Onuoha ducked under it and Kane beat Green to the ball to head it past the onrushing keeper and into the empty net.

Luck ran against the home team before the interval when Mauricio Isla ran on to a clever through ball from Steven Caulker and appeared to be brought down by Lloris. To bitter protests from QPR, referee Pawson waved play on.

Kane showed in stoppage time at the end of the half what a fine all-round player he is becoming with a fine pass out to Townsend. Townsend’s shot took an awkward deflection and Green scrambled to his right to push it out. And Spurs began the second half in the same vein when a ferocious, whipped shot from Eriksen beat the despairing dive of Green only to rebound off the inside of a post.

QPR were desperately trying to stay in touch now and it took some desperate defending to stop Spurs extending their lead.

Kane showed great vision again to play in Walker on the right and when Green smothered his attempted cross, Eriksen followed up with a crisp volley that was blocked on the line by Austin.

QPR couldn’t hold Spurs at bay any longer, though, and midway through the half, Kane put the match out of their reach. He beat the offside trap and ran on to a ball from Ryan Mason, whose energy and ability will also have caught Hodgson’s eye, before taking the ball round Green and sliding it into an empty net. That goal sparked a frantic QPR fightback. Fifteen minutes from the end, Austin, who had worked himself into the ground, crossed for Zamora. He laid the ball back into the path of the Brazilian, Sandro, whose neat side-foot beat Lloris low to his left.

Rangers then laid siege to the Spurs goal in the dying minutes but Tottenham defended stoutly and Ramsey’s team were left to rue their shortcomings at the back and contemplate an increasingly forlorn fight for Premier League survival.

Ramsey, whose side have lost their last three games, was asked after the match whether he would pick Kane for England.

‘Me?’ he said, smiling. ‘Yes, I would. But the way I’m going, I’m not likely to be in that position any time soon.’
