Four pipe bombs were thrown out of a car in the middle of a chase with Portland police officers Tuesday afternoon, authorities said.

Sgt. Pete Simpson with the Portland Police Department said the incident occurred just after 4:40pm.

'East Precinct officers attempted to stop a silver Honda Civic 2-door on Southeast Flavel Drive but the driver sped away from police,' he said in a release.

Suspect: Authorities are looking for Neal Allen Panschow, who is suspected of driving the car when the four pipe bombs were thrown

Hunt: The bomb technicians found four pipe bombs in a Portland neighborhood, a police spokesman said 

He continued, 'As the driver began to elude officers, an item that appears to be an explosive device was tossed from the vehicle and was left in the roadway, on Flavel Drive at 45th Avenue.' 

Traffic was shut down before bomb technicians showed up, Simpson said.

Joe Reed, who lives in the neighborhood, told KGW 'I heard sirens, lots of sirens. This is the first time we've had an incident like this.' 

The technicians later found four pipe bombs in the area - but they did not go off, Simpson said. He stated that police performed several evacuations. 

Another neighbor, David Horenstein, told KGW he felt 'Just sort of uncomfortable because it's been a safe neighborhood.'

The evacuated areas are open again, KGW reported. 

History: Neil Panschow (seen left and right in older mugshots) already has multiple convictions, including for theft, public indecency, reckless driving, and attempting to elude a police officer

Authorities are looking for a 2002 Honda Civic that has two doors, is silver, and has 064CPJ Oregon plates, Simpson said.

They are also trying to find Neal Allen Panschow, who is suspected of having been behind the wheel during the chase.

The 43-year-old 'has an active warrant from Tillamook County and investigators believe he has been driving the vehicle for the past few days and has led police on three pursuits in Clackamas and Multnomah Counties,' Simpson said.

Panschow weighs 170 pounds and stands 5'10 tall, and is considered armed and dangerous, Simpson said. 

He has theft, public indecency, reckless driving, attempting to elude a police officer, and driving while suspended convictions, plus two attempting to elude a police officer convictions, KPTV reported.

The Tillamook County warrant stems from reckless driving and attempting to elude charges, according to the affiliate station.
