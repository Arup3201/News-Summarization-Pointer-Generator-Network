A mother has criticised the Passport Office and its photo rules after it took her five hours to get a useable snap of her newborn baby for his passport.

Six-week-old Lucas Thursby is due to fly with parents Emma Mitchell and Graeme Thursby to Costa Del Sol, Spain, in August.

But Miss Mitchell, 29, from Inchinnan, Renfrewshire, wishes she picked a holiday in Scotland after the passport photo session with a professional photographer turned into an all-afternoon marathon.

The ones that didn't work: Lucas tries his best at the marathon photo shoot. Rules state that babies must look directly into the camera with a straight face, both ears must be visible and no one else can be in the frame

Strict rules on passport pictures mean 
the subject has to be looking directly at the camera with a straight 
face, both ears visible and no-one else in the frame.

Miss Mitchell said: 'My hands couldn’t be in it at all. I was holding him at the waist and I was scared that his neck was getting sore.

'I think the rules are ridiculous. The are too constraining.'

What
 the family hoped would be a 15-minute photo shoot turned into an 
endurance test that stretched from midday to 5pm before they finally got
 a suitable image.

That's the one! After five hours, Lucas took a photo that passed the Passport Office's rules. The application form and precious photo have joined a queue of nearly 500,000 in the backlog

Mrs Mitchell, a company administrator, said Lucas remained calm, but admitted: 'I was stressed and I was getting upset.'

She
 added: 'The passport lasts five years. How do you expect strangers to 
identify babies from photos, that in a couple of years, they won’t look 
anything like?

'I am trying to plan something that is meant to be exciting and fun, but this has put a bit of a dampener on things.'

Family holiday: Emma Mitchell and her fiance Graeme Thursby are planning to take their six-month-son Lucus on a to Costa Del Sol, Spain in August. Miss Mitchell called the passport rules 'ridiculous' and 'constraining'

The family paid a £90 fee for Lucas’ passport but the photographer is a family friend who gave his time for free.

To add insult to injury, the application form and precious photo have joined a queue of nearly 500,000 passports in the backlog.

'It
 was so difficult,' said Miss Mitchell. 'But I’m not the first and I 
certainly won’t be the last parent to struggle with this.

'I just hope his passport comes on time.'
