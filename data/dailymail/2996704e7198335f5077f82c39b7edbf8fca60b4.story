Travel giant First Choice has been ordered to pay £1.7million compensation to British holidaymakers who fell ill at a 'luxury' Turkish resort which had faeces in the swimming pool.

The four-star Holiday Village complex in Sarigerme was inundated with complaints after 595 visitors’ dream vacations turned into holidays from hell in 2009.

Tourists complained about dirty toilets and cutlery, a lack of hot water and floating faeces in the pool.

The food was left uncovered for long periods - and was even reheated to be served up as an evening meal.

In total 160 children and 435 adults fell ill with chronic gastric bugs after staying at the resort on the coast in southern Turkey.

Some travellers were so ill they 
needed hospital treatment at the time while others needed medical help 
after returning to Britain.

Deputy
 Senior Master Leslie sitting in the High Court in London ordered First 
Choice Holidays and Flights Limited to pay the families involved up to 
£25,000 compensation each.

Holidaymakers were struck down by a range of conditions including Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter and E-Coli.

Suki Chhokar, from law firm Irwin Mitchell, said that some of the victims have not yet made a full recovery.

'Many of our clients suffered illnesses that continued after they returned home and some have still not made a complete recovery more than four years after their original illness commenced,' he said.

'Holidaymakers have a right to expect all reasonable steps will be taken to protect their health abroad in hotels or on cruise ships.

'Our clients in this case have proven failure to do so will not be tolerated and, if necessary, holidaymakers will turn to the courts to secure justice.'

Stuart Harvey, 24, fell ill while staying at the resort in September 2009 to celebrate his engagement to fiancee Michaela Bradley, 25.

He was struck down by crippling stomach cramps after going swimming in the pool and has now been told he will receive a £9,015 payout.

Anger: Stuart Harvey, 24, said he has not gone abroad after falling sick in Turkey and being forced to have a month off work

After undergoing tests he discovered he had been infected with the parasite Cryptosporidium, and he was forced to take a month off from his job at a bread factory.

He said: 'It was awful, a real holiday from hell. I was crippled in the foetal position for the last couple of days of my holiday.

'I thought it was just a bug from some dodgy food and wanted to forget about it so we could enjoy our holiday.

'Although I couldn’t eat, drink or sleep and it felt like someone was stabbing me in the stomach.

'I found out I’ve got Irritable Bowel Syndrome and I have to be really careful now, I haven’t been abroad since and don’t know when I will next go.

'I definitely won’t be going with First Choice again, that’s for sure. This has led to so much stress.

'I was in the pool all the time, there were families and children in the pool too, it is awful that First Choice knew people were going to get ill.

'You don’t expect something like this to happen, I was left in shock, we both were, somehow, luckily, Michaela didn’t get ill.'

David Knighton, 45, from Birmingham saw his sons Keiron, 14, and Shane, 17, suffer severe vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps after their two-week break.

Another unhappy customer, Nicola Nugent, 39, from Carlisle, has her two-week holiday ruined when two of her children, Abbye, 13, and Zakary, six, suffered from e-coli.

A spokesman for First Choice refused to comment.

The case happened after our operators agreed to pay out £5.5million last year to almost a thousand British tourists struck down by food poisoning at a hotel in the Dominican Republic.

First Choice agreed a £1.9m settlement of claims brought by over 400 holiday-makers, 60 of them children, who stayed in 2007 at the Bahia Principe resort, in San Juan.

The deal was on top of settlements previously reached with Thomas Cook, My Travel and Thomson in hundreds of other cases of tourists who claimed there were struck down by severe gastric illnesses including Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter.

The claimants' solicitors, Irwin Mitchell, said weddings, honeymoons and birthday celebrations were ruined by food-poisoning outbreaks which at one stage saw a fleet of ambulances ferrying guests to hospital daily.
