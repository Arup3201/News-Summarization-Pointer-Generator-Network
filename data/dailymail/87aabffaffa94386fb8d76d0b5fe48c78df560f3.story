A Palestinian man was shot by a passing civilian after he attacked an Israeli family who were picking up a hitch-hiker near Jerusalem.

The attacker threw a 'chemical substance' at the father, four young children, and another man - before chasing them with a screwdriver, the Israel Defence Forces have said.

A civilian who was driving past at the time, stopped his car and opened fire at the assailant.

He shot him twice in the legs before the authorities arrested him near a checkpoint south of Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank. The severity of his injuries are unclear and no groups have claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Israeli family were taken to a nearby hospital after suffering 'light wounds'.

Palestinians residents at the scene named the attacker as Jamal Ghayyada, 46, from the nearby village of Nahalin.

They claim he was mentally unstable and had previously received treatment at a mental health clinic in Bethlehem. They added that he had been arrested before.

The Israeli Army said in a statement: 'A vehicle carrying a family with four girls picked up a hitchhiker near a checkpoint outside Bethlehem, and close to the Gush Etzion settlement area.

'The hitchhiker threw acid on the passengers, injuring them lightly.' 

This latest incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two nations - following the death of a Palestinian official during a confrontation with Israeli troops on Wednesday.

Ziad Abu Ain died shortly after an Israeli soldier grabbed him by the neck in a scuffle, and hit him in the chest with the butt of his rifle. 

An Israel official who attended the autopsy said the minister had died of a heart attack, possibly brought on by stress, while a Palestinian pathologist concluded the grab to his neck lead to heart failure.

The Palestinian leadership blamed Israel for his death and threatened retaliation, amid speculation they would suspend security coordination with Israel in the West Bank.

US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Rome Sunday as part of efforts to defuse the fall-out caused by the death.

Violence: At least 10 Israeli's and one foreigner have been killed by Palestinians in knife or car-based attacks in the last four months

Retracted: The Israeli military originally said the attack was carried out by the hitch-hiker but later rescinded that statement

Anger: The acid attack comes two days after a Palestinian official, Ziad Abu Ain (pictured), died shortly after an Israeli soldier hit him in the chest with a rifle butt 

Over the past four months, 10 Israelis and one foreign visitor have been killed by Palestinians in knife or car-based attacks.

Meanwhile at least a dozen Palestinians have also been killed, including most of those who carried out the killings. 

The burning alive of a Palestinian in July - a revenge attack for the murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank - sparked months of unrest which led to a bloody 50-day war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas.

Israel blamed Hamas for the Israeli murders, and rounded up hundreds of its members in the West Bank.
