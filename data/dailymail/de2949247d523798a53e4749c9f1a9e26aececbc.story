Lena Dunham, creator of the popular HBO series Girls  called Woody Allen a 'perv,' on a panel at the Sundance Film Festival.

Dunham spoke about a relationship Woody Allen's character has with a 17 year old in the film Manhattan, and then about the fact he later married his young stepdaughter Sun Yi.

'Woody Allen is proof that people don't think that everything he does in his films is stuff that he does,' she started, 'because all he was doing was making out with 17-year-old girls for years and we didn't say a word about it. And then he did it. A bunch. No one went, 'Oh, Woody Allen is making out with a 17-year-old in the film Manhattan and then lo and behold ...'

The Girls creator has said the allegations that Allen sexually molested his estranged daughter, Dylan Farrow, made her 'nauseated.'

Something to talk about: Dunham gave her two cents on campus rape, abortion, and director Woody Allen. In her recent book 'Not That Kind of Girl' she reveals that she was actually a victim date rape in college

Opening-up: She openly aired her disgust about Woody Allen's allegations of molestation to Mia Farrow

Outspoken:  'In some ways America is at its most puritanical,' Lena Dunham said Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival' 

Disliked: Dunham has been critical of the director ever since his former girlfriend Mia Farrow and her son tweeted about the Golden Globes tribute to Allen in 2014

Dunham has been critical of the director ever since his former girlfriend Mia Farrow and her son tweeted about the Golden Globes tribute to Allen in 2014. 

Of course, Dunham has her own skeletons in the closet, which were not even given a second mention during the discussion. 

In her memoir, 'Dunham admits to, for no apparent reason, inspecting her one year old sister's vagina. She writes her 'curiosity got the best' of her.

In addition, she admitted to bribing her little sister to kiss her on the mouth, 'Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl, I was trying.'

Dunham shared the stage with The Mindy Project creator Mindy Kaling, Bridesmaids star and co-writer Kristen Wiig and Orange Is the New Black show-runner Jenji Kohan for a discussion on women in Hollywood.

In the end, the conversation was far more wide ranging as they ladies went onto  discuss pushing humor boundaries, as well as rape on college campuses in America.

'In some ways America is at its most puritanical,' said Dunham in response to a question regarding some of the reactions Girls has received. 

'The fact is people are forgetting that humor is a tool for debate. That boycott, censorship, shut 'em down approach to humor shows a very basic lack of understanding of what humor can do for us culturally and what it has always done.'

Reality check: Dunham say that the character she plays on 'Girls' is also a privileged, intelligent twenty-something writer living in New York. The actress said many viewers assume the two are one and the same

Opinionated: Dunham, 28, who recently published the bestselling memoir Not That Kind of Girl, said the phenomenal popularity of her series Girls has seen her tagged with the dreaded 'voice of a generation' label

Speaking out: The actress ended the talk with her thoughts on the increasingly prevalent issue of sexual assaults taking place in colleges across the country 

She also told the audience that she is quite different from her character, Hannah Horvath.

'People equate the words coming out of your character's mouth with a real life philosophy that you don't possess.' 

The topic then shifted to that of abortion and campus rape.

'The idea that women can't be complete and total citizens until they have control over the destiny of their own bodies is important to me' Dunham said of reproductive rights in America. 

'It's not just a political issue, it's a lot about class, race and it feeds into all these other forms of inequality and injustice that exist in our country.'

Topical: The Girls star and creator candidly worked in her thoughts on abortion, campus rape, and Woody Allen into a panel at Sundance

Dunham  wrote in her recent best selling memoir Not That Kind of Girl about an assault on her when she was in college.

'One of the reasons it is important to talk about campus assaults is that that these women in positions of incredible privilege are still being forced every day to fight for their truth and that is indicative of the fact that sexual assault is an epidemic and so many people are voiceless.

 I think campus' are a great place to start because that's where we're being educated and that's where we're told we're going to be safe.'

The four women on the panel also weighed in how they broke into the entertainment industry and the challenges they face as its minority gender. 

All said they realized early on that if they wanted to tell the stories they cared most about, they'd have to take the reins and do it themselves. And they found TV a far friendlier environment for female voices than film.

'There's just a lot more opportunity,' Kohan said. 'It seems like film is really behind.'

Even with the success of 'Weeds' and 'Orange Is the New Black,' Kohan said the only scripts she's been offered to write involve 'weddings and moms.'

Dunham, too, said after earning acclaim for her first film, 'Tiny Furniture,' she was given opportunities to pen such scripts as 'Strawberry Shortcake.' She wasn't interested, so she created 'Girls.'

They hope their current successes help pave the way for other women with Hollywood dreams. All four rely on writing teams populated by mostly women, but they don't count men out.

'You shouldn't have to just limit yourself to one gender,' Kohan said. 'You want to work with whoever is the best at what they're doing.'.
