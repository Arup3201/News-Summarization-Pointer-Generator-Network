Big Brother star Jade Goody has been revealed as the inspiration behind the government’s wide-ranging reforms of the education system.

She was ridiculed in her first appearance on the Channel 4 show when she thought East Anglia was a foreign country.

But Education Secretary Michael Gove launched a spirited defence of the late TV celebrity, insisting she was let down by her teachers but was bright enough to turn her notoriety into millions of pounds which she used to send her children to a top school.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said Jade Goody had proved that she was intelligent but had been let down by her schooling

Mr Gove even ranked Goody, who died from cervical cancer in 2009, alongside Italian Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci when naming the influences on his reforms.

He insisted Goody’s ‘lack of knowledge’ was the fault of her poor education but proved her intelligence by turning her brief spell in the limelight coming in Big Brother 2002 into a multi-million pound career.

‘When she first appeared on our screens in Big Brother Jade was regarded as paragon of invincible ignorance,’ Mr Gove said.

‘She was derided and mocked because she thought that Cambridge was in London. On being told that Cambridge is in East Anglia, she assumed that to be abroad, and referred to it as ‘East Angular’.

‘Her other misconceptions included the belief that Rio de Janeiro was a person and not a city.’

Mr Gove said that his reforms were not really Conservative, but uncompromisingly radical

Mr Gove said it was a ‘double cruelty’ to mock these errors. ‘Deriving entertainment from another’s misfortunes is wrong in itself. But in any case, her lack of knowledge was not her fault but the education system’s.’

But he said there was ‘no doubt’ that she was intelligent. ‘She exploited the notoriety she had earned to make herself a ubiquitous television and magazine presence, earning huge sums in the process and becoming in due course far wealthier than most of her detractors.’

And when diagnosed with cervical cancer she ‘husbanded her earnings’ for her two sons to attend ‘the most traditional, academically demanding prep school she could find’.

‘So they could enjoy the best education reality TV could buy.’

Mr Gove said Goody was an example of thousands of parents who want their children to do better.

‘Because parents – especially poorer parents – want their children to get up and get on. And that means acquiring a proper rounded rigorous education. In the hope that they can choose to go to university.

‘Jade knew that the most precious thing she could bequeath her children was not money but knowledge and the best guarantee of their future happiness was not the power to indulge whims with cash but the power to choose your own future through education.

‘The idea that there is a significant number of parents who lack ambition for their children, who are not aspirational, who scorn book learning and are hostile to academic excellence is just not true.’

He said that pupils should have a 'stock of knowledge' about history, 
culture, maths and science in order to understand the world around them.

Ministers are due to set out their new curriculum for primary and secondary schools within days.

But Labour's Stephen Twigg today accused Mr Gove of pursuing an 'outdated' measure of educational achievement based on a narrow group of academic subjects.

The shadow education secretary said he wants to see 'rigour in the whole curriculum', rather than in selected subjects.

Mr Twigg said: 'For him it's only aspirational to pursue an academic route. This is one of the many false choices that he argues.

'I believe that high quality vocational education is something to aspire to, and as the evidence shows from many high performing countries in vocational education - like Switzerland and Germany - it's the high flyers who choose to study it. I want high quality academic and high quality vocational education.'

Goody appeared on Big Brother in 2002 and the Celebrity version in 2007, turning her notoriety into a multi-million pound career before her death in 2009

In a speech to the Social Market 
Foundation last night, Mr Gove said his reforms were not conservative 
'but rather uncompromisingly radical'.

He said: 'Because conservatives have always tended to suspect that many of the things which need to be protected from generation to generation - the Royal Opera House, the House of Lords, the Bar, Oxford High Table, agreeable homes with lovely views over the Downs, marriage, the bench of bishops, Lord Lieutenancies and Tate Gallery directorships - can only be protected if they're enjoyed by a minority.

'I don't look at the world that way. I think the things we need to protect and enhance - a love of literature, pride in our history, scientific curiosity, beautiful written English, innovative and creative mathematical thinking, joy in discovery, colleges and universities, liberal learning and openness to the world, female emancipation and social mobility - are all better protected if we make them as universal as possible.

'And I suspect that even if not every Conservative agrees with me, Jade Goody and Antonio Gramsci would.'
