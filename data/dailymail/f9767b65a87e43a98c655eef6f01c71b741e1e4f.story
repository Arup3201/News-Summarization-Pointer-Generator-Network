A lesbian barmaid who changed her name in homage to Doris Day was subjected to a barrage of homophobic abuse at work, an employment tribunal heard.

Clancey Von Kappelhoff-Day, who altered her surname to match that of her heroine, claims she was physically and verbally attacked by colleagues at the trendy East London pub.

The American singer, actress and gay icon was born Doris Mary Ann Von Kappelhoff before picking out a stage name.

Ms Von Kappelhoff-Day said she was labelled a 'lezza' by senior members of staff at Hoxton's fashionable Commercial Tavern, threatened with a hammer and invited to gay orgies.

She told the East London Tribunal that 
the pub owner, Michael Burgess, and bar manager Maria Bather subjected
her to months of verbal abuse and even violence between July to October last year.

The management of the Commerical Tavern, which is a sister pub to Soho gay bar the Friendly Society, strongly deny her allegations.

'Abuse': Ms Von Kappelhoff-Day said she was pushed down the stairs, invited to gay orgies and threatened with a hammer

'With my sexuality mostly it was Michael Burgess,' Ms Von Kappelhoff-Day told the pre-hearing review.

'He occasionally used the word "lezza". More often he would discuss my sexuality
with customers in the bar and tell them I was his lesbian girlfriend 
and discuss lesbian sexual acts.

'Michael verbally and physically 
assaulted me because I was gay and I experienced more discrimination 
than the other females because of it.

'Michael Burgess only assaults 
women. He wouldn’t have assaulted me if I was a man. With women, Michael physically touches 
them. He also asks them to perform sex acts and if people make 
complaints then basically they get more harassment.'

Ms Von Kappelhoff-Day said bar manager Ms Bather, with whom Mr Burgess is
in a relationship, would join in the homophobic abuse and 
even invited her to gay orgies.

The claimed the alleged
abuse escalated when she was pushed down the pub’s stairs by Mr Burgess
after he accused her of having an affair with Ms Bather.

Just a fortnight later, on October 7, 
she said Mr Burgess physically assaulted her and then Ms Bather turned
up at her house to threaten her with a hammer.

The bartender, who suffers from bi-polar disorder, also claims she was subjected to belittling comments accusing her of being a 'mentalist' and was refused breaks, despite both bosses knowing about her condition.

Harriet Davies, representing Brimheath Developments, which owns the pub, said they were shocked by the 'extreme allegations' and said Ms Von Kappelhoff-Day’s claims were 'bordering on fanciful.'

She said: 'To a certain extent it was clear that the claimant was making things up as she went along.

'She was unspecific about things. These allegations are bordering on fanciful.'

Ms Davies told the tribunal that Mr Burgess strongly denies claims he pushed the bartender down the stairs, and that a case brought against Ms Bather for threatening her with a hammer was eventually dropped by police.

Ms Von Kappelhoff-Day is suing Ms Bather, Mr Burgess and Brimheath Developments for sex and disability discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of her sexual orientation and breach of contract.

The hearing was adjourned until January.
