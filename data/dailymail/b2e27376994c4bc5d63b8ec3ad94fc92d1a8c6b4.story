Facial recognition is helping improve everything from gaming to fighting crime - and now it could help in the battle against cat obesity.

A new gadget that uses ‘cutting-edge cat facial recognition technology’ promises to monitor our feline friends’ appetites and alert owners to any problems.

The Bistro system, created by Taiwanese company 42Ark, uses a camera at the front of a feeder to identify each of the cats.

A new gadget that uses ‘cutting-edge cat facial recognition technology’ promises to monitor our feline friends’ appetites and alert owners to any problems. The Bistro system, created by Taiwanese company 42Ark, uses a camera at the front of a feeder to identify each of the cats

Alongside the camera, weight sensors beneath both the animal and the bowl calculate how much they have eaten.

The information is then sent via Wi-Fi to a connected smartphone app where owners can keep tabs on their pet’s 'diet history'.

The system analyses the history automatically to ﬁnd out about abnormal intake and warn the owner if necessary.

The Bistro system, created by Taiwanese company 42Ark, uses a camera at the front of a feeder to identify each of the cats.

Alongside the camera, weight sensors beneath both the animal and the bowl calculate how much they have eaten.

The information is then sent via Wi-Fi to a connected smartphone app where owners can keep tabs on their pet’s 'diet history'.

The system analyses the history automatically to ﬁnd out about abnormal intake and warn the owner if necessary.

It also provides better food suggestions for cat owners to keep their cats in shape.

Owners can even watch their cats feeding in real-time via the app. ‘It's like having a full-time nanny taking care of your kitties,’ 42Ark says.

The idea came about after the Bistro’s creator, Mu-Chi Sung, discovered that his pet cat Momo developed pancreatitis and had stopped eating.

But the realisation came late, as Mr Sung’s other pets had been eating Momo’s food while she was wasting away.

The product is currently in the middle of a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo with 29 days left to go.

The gadget has an expected retail price for £175 ($299) but early backers can order Bistro on Indiegogo now for half the price.
