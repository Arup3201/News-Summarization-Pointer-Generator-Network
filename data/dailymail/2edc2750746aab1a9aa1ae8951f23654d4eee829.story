Sisters Tallulah and Sequoia Ferguson spent today basking joyously in a poppy field - and things can only get better.

Thursday could be the hottest day of the year so far with south east England expected to nudge 27C or 28C - seizing the current record from Cuper in Fife, an honour Scottish regions don't often hold.

The first day of July saw walkers and picknickers stream into the sunshine and the usual array of pleasure boats in spots like the Serpentine in London's Hyde Park and the River Cam in Cambridge.

Heavenly! Three-year-old Tallulah Ferguson and her two-year-old sister Sequoia bask in the summer weather in a poppy field overlooking Mount's Bay, Penzance. Britain could enjoy the hottest day of the year so far on Thursday with temperatures nudging 27C or 28C in the south east - which is set to steal the crown from Cuper in Fife

Sun! The first day of July saw walkers and picknickers stream into the warm weather and sparked the usual array of pleasure boats and sun-worshippers

But those who want to enjoy the weather had better make the most of it. Although things will clear by Thursday, tomorrow will see bands of showers sweep down from northern Scotland with up to a centimetre of rain falling in an hour in some areas.

And on Friday, once the mini-heatwave has passed, large parts of the country are set to be hit by rain again especially towards the evening.

Showers are expected to persist through some of the weekend - which could mean a damp welcome for the glitterati of the cycling world when they descend on Leeds for the first stage of the Tour de France on Saturday.

And strawberries and cream sales at Wimbledon could be affected as the eyes of the world fixate on Centre Court for the ladies' singles final on Saturday, followed by the men's final on Sunday.

A Met Office spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Tomorrow’s looking fairly dry and sunny – there’s bits of cloud around for most people and there’s a chance that there could be some showers moving into north west Scotland in the afternoon.

‘Some areas could have 10mm in an hour as the band of showers moves down across the north of the country.

Picturesque: With these scenes today in the south west of England, the rain and mud of Glastonbury seems like an age ago - and things are due to peak on Thursday

Careful! Tallulah Ferguson, three, (pictured) had better not be a hayfever sufferer as Thursday's hot temperatures and clear skies will send pollen counts soaring

Enjoy it while you can: Showers will begin to sweep across Britain on Friday and could persist into the weekend, dampening Wimbledon and the Tour de France

‘Thursday is probably going to be the warmest day of the week. We could see temperatures in the mid-20s for most of England and Wales and the south east will see temperatures of 25C or 26C.

‘We may just bump a 27C which was the warmest day of the year so far on June 18 in Cuper, Fife – a rare honour for Scotland.

‘Unfortunately grass pollen levels will be high or very high which isn’t helped by the hot weather and clear skies.

‘Into the weekend it becomes a bit more changeable. The south east will hold on to that dry weather the longest but we’ll see increasingly showery weather.'

The warm weather comes after seven warmer-than-average months in a row - which have brought autumn forward and led to a bumper year for British wine.

Growers claim 2014 could be a vintage year for British plonk, once widely sneered at, with growers at home taking on the legendary names from historic European vineyards and the New World.

Clive Vickers, who co-owns the Halfpenny Green Vineyard in 
Bobbington, Shopshire, said: 'We've been growing grapes here for 30 
years now and going back to the 1980s there was definitely a stigma 
attached to what we were doing.

Idyllic: The River Cam was as crowded as ever today as tourists flocked to Cambridge, where temperatures could reach their highest level of the year so far on Thursday

A dog's life: Pleasure-seekers of all species enjoyed the sunny weather today on the River Cam, and there could be more to come, but only while most people are at work

Plonk: There is plenty for those punting on the River Cam to drink while they enjoy themselves, as a warm seven months have led to bumper British wines

'But during the last two or 
three years, as a country, we have realised we can now make really 
decent wine, which is now winning awards on a regular basis.

'Such is the interest we are no longer producing enough wine to deal with the demand.'

English Wine Producers, a group representing many top vineyards, said: 'The 2013 harvest figures for the UK revealed the highest production on record, a total of 33,384 hectolitres, equating to just below 4.5million bottles.

'This is the highest volume ever, breaking the previous record of four million bottles in 2010. The increase reflects the on-going rise in planting that the industry continues to experience. In the last seven years, hectarage has doubled. 

'Sparkling wine now accounts for around two thirds of England's total production with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier accounting for just under 50 per cent of recent plantings, followed by Bacchus.'

Today conservationists, including from the National Trust, Woodland Trust and RSPB, united to say our fields, woodlands and hedgerows are displaying signs of change they would not usually expect to see until August or September.

Sizzling! Crowds enjoyed a bright day at Wimbledon, but things could turn before the weekend - bad news for the ladies' singles final on Saturday and the men on Sunday

Forecast: Which areas could be facing rain over the next few days. Despite some rain Thursday could be the hottest day of the year in the south east

Hawthorn berries are already turning red, holly berries are ripening, and beech and hazel nuts are developing months ahead of schedule.

Leon Brown, meteorologist at The Weather Channel, said the first tropical weather system of the summer is due to move over the northern Atlantic towards the end of this week.

He said: 'It looks like we will see quite a drop in temperatures this weekend as a cold front moves south east from Friday night to Saturday morning. North west England and north Wales may receive over 30mm of rainfall.

'Wimbledon should be fine and sunny for the women's final with the roof open, but there is risk of showers on Sunday afternoon for the men's final.

'For the Tour de France early rain Saturday morning should clear to sunshine and isolated showers, and much of the afternoon fine and quite sunny with a moderate west wind.'

Mr Brown agreed Thursday could be the hottest day of the year - saying temperatures may nudge 28C in the south east.
