Marc-Andre ter Stegen played a crucial part in Barcelona's victory against Manchester City as he thwarted Sergio Aguero's 78th-minute penalty effort, but it looks like the Barca goalkeeper has one of his team-mates to thank for his spot-kick heroics. 

Trailing 1-0 on the night, and 3-1 on aggregate, City were handed a lifeline when Aguero was tripped by Gerard Pique in the penalty area.  

Referee Gianluca Rocchi pointed to the spot with City's top scorer stepping up to take the penalty. As Aguero got ready for his spot-kick, Barca midfielder Javier Mascherano pointed in the direction he thought his fellow Argentine would shoot.

Ter Stegen admitted that Mascherano advised him but he decided to make up his own mind in the end 

Lo and behold, Aguero fired his penalty effort in the same direction with Ter Stegen taking Mascherano's advice and diving the same way.

Mascherano admitted trying to advise his keeper on which way to dive for Aguero's penalty. 'I know from international duty how he takes spot-kicks,' said the midfielder after the game. 

Ter Stegen admitted being advised by both Mascherano and Rafinha but in the end made his own mind up.
