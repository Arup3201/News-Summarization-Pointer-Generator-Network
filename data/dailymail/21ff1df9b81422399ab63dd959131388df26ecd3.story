Up to £100,000 of fuel is being wasted by police who leave their car engines running even when they are not in them, it has been claimed.

The force cars are fitted with technology which means they have to stay on in order for the in-car computers to work, despite no officers being in the car.

The Met Police have a fleet of 700 vehicles with the Runlock technology. It works by linking with a control centre, which remotely controls the lights and radio.

If the engine is switched off it can take seven minutes to restart the computer.

The Sun reports that the BMW cars used by the Met use 1.5 litres of diesel an hour - which for 1,000 cars left on for an hour a week would cost in the region of £104,000.

Green party peer Jenny Jones told the paper that more and more homeowners were coming to her with concerns.

She said: 'It's polluting our streets and is a potential drain on public money.'

It comes as one London council has introduced fines for motorists who leave their diesel engines running, in a bid to cut pollution.

Islington council has begun issuing on-the-spot £20 penalties for drivers who 
fail to turn their engines off when stationary, and others are likely to follow suit in order to meet European environmental targets.

London mayor Boris Johnson has already revealed plans to charge owners of diesel cars £10 extra to enter the centre of the capital from 2020.

Officials from Islington Council in North London are to issue the on-the-spot fines, and will target buses, lorries and diesel cars

Communities
 minister Brandon Lewis called the fines a way to ‘tax drivers by 
stealth’ and warned that they could push people away from high streets.

Councils gained the power to issue penalties for idling in 2002 but the rule has not been widely enforced until now. 

A Met Police spokesman said: 'Short journeys use lots of powered equipment and flatten batteries much faster.

'Most of the fleets are now fitted with a secondary battery. New systems expected later this year will negate the need to leave engines running irrespective of the time away from the vehicle.'
