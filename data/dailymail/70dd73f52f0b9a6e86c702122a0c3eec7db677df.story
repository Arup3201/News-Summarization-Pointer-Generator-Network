A three-year-old girl was murdered after being abducted from her kindergarten.

The body of Viktoria Vylegzhanina was found five days after she was snatched by an apparent stranger.

Her mother Galina only realised her daughter was missing when she went to collect her at the end of the day.

After an hour of searching in all her daughter's favourite places, including the swings at the local park, she called police who launched a full-scale search operation.

By the second day, the numbers involved in the search in the Siberian city of Tomsk had increased to over 1,000.

But five days later tragedy struck when the toddler's body was found, it was reported by The Siberian Times.

Mrs Vylegzhanina said: 'I was told that a man had collected her and I called my husband Eduard but it was not him.'

Eduard said: 'My wife called me and asked me "Did you take Vika from kindergarten?"

'I said no and then she said "In that case our girl is missing".'

Hunt for killer: A one million rouble (£15,000) reward has been offered for information Viktoria's murder

He is convinced it is not anyone known to the family.

'Any child could be in our Vika's place,' he said.

'It was not someone we knew. I think that he pulled her over the fence.'

All that is known of the man who abducted the girl is that he was in his 40s and wearing a coloured T-shirt.

A one million rouble (£15,000) reward has been offered for information on her abductor.

Tomsk mayor Ivan Klein earlier praised volunteers who joined the hunt for the missing girl, many with dogs, saying: 'We examined almost the entire territory.

'But at the end we can only offer our condolences to the family, and redouble our efforts to find Vika's killer.'
