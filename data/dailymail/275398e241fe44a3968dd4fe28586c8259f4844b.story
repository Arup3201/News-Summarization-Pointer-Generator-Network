Drunk and swaying in a T-shirt and trilby, Mick Philpott performs karaoke at a pub party just days after killing six of his children in a house fire.

Locals watched in disgust as he downed shots, embraced his wife Mairead and took centre stage to sing Elvis Presley’s hit Suspicious Minds.

The bizarre behaviour in the wake of the deaths prompted witnesses to call the police, who arrested the couple just nine hours later.

Philpott, 56, was last week jailed for
life for killing children Duwayne, 13, Jade, ten, John, nine, Jack, 
eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five. Mairead and best friend Paul Mosley
were also jailed for 17 years for manslaughter.

They set the fire in a botched attempt
to frame Philpott’s former live-in lover Lisa Willis, who had moved out
of their family home earlier in the year with her five children, taking
with her the £1,000 a month they were worth in benefit payments.

The scorched home where the Philpott 
children died will now be bulldozed in an attempt to help the community 
move on from the tragedy.

On May 26 last year, just 15 days 
after the fatal fire, Philpott and his wife went to the Navigation Inn 
in Derby, located across the road from the conference centre where they 
sobbed for the cameras days earlier at a now infamous press conference.

Killer: Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead speak at a press conference after the fatal house fire he started in his home. Detectives became suspicious because of his unusual behaviour in the days after the deaths

They arrived at about 4.30pm and were 
seen drinking vodka, gin, rum and Jack Daniel’s before Philpott, clearly
revelling in the attention, got up to the microphone.

He sang the 1975 
Elvis classic Suspicious Minds, with the line: ‘We’re caught in a trap, I
can’t walk out, because I love you too much baby.’

CCTV footage shows his wife, also in a
trilby, giggling and sitting on his lap before joining him for a duet 
of Elvis’s My Boy, a song they would sing to their children at night.

A number of people who had seen the 
performance were so stunned they called the police to report them acting
suspiciously. Staff at the pub then handed the CCTV footage to 
officers.

Jeanette Doherty, landlady of the 
Navigation Inn, said she was appalled when Philpott started singing. 
‘The two of them were up dancing and having a good time,’ she said.

‘She
was round the pool table grinding up against young lads.

‘It was bizarre behaviour. At first 
people were just shocked that Mick and Mairead were even there. You 
don’t expect to see a couple whose six children have just died to be out
partying.

'They were laughing and joking. I don’t know how they could 
live day to day knowing they had caused their six kids to die, let alone
go out enjoying themselves.’

Her husband Russell added: ‘People 
just couldn’t believe it. It made them think something strange was going
on and there was something not quite right.’

The Philpotts were already
under suspicion by that point. They had been acting increasingly 
erratically, ordering that thousands of pounds donated for the 
children’s funeral be given to them as an Argos voucher.

Philpott had also demanded friends 
collect teddy bears from outside their home to auction off for cash.

The
footage has emerged amid news that the Philpott’s house will be 
bulldozed. The house has stood empty and boarded up since the fire.

Local council leader Paul Bayliss 
said: ‘Who would want to live in a house where six children have died 
and why would you want to live next door to where six children have 
died?’
