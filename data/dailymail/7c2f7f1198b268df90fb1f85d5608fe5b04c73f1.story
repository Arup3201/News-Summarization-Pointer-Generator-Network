Missing: Madeleine McCann was last seen in a flat in the Algarve in May 2007 and is the subject of a global police search

Police have identified a new suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann and are set to release an 'e-fit' photograph of him, it was claimed today.

Officials apparently hope the photograph will enable them to track the man down, more than six years after Madeleine went missing from a flat in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz.

Sky News reported that the picture is set to be released by the Metropolitan Police, which has taken over the investigation into the girl's disappearance from Portuguese police.

The man was apparently seen near the flat around the time that Madeleine, then aged three, disappeared while her parents Kate and Gerry were dining at a nearby restaurant in May 2007.

Scotland Yard today refused to confirm or 
deny the claims, saying that it was planning 'a series of public 
appeals' in a variety of countries.

A police statement said: 'We are not prepared to discuss, comment or speculate on the content of the upcoming appeal in relation to the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.

'This has been weeks in the planning and each element of the investigation must be set into the overall context of the appeal.

'We will be asking for help from the public in a number of countries, delivered through a series of public appeals.

'We will do nothing to jeopardise the effectiveness of these appeals and we have repeatedly stated that media speculation can be damaging to our efforts.

'The MPS will release the relevant material at the relevant time.'

Parents: Kate and Gerry McCann are currently suing a disgraced Portuguese police chief

The image will be released within a few days and will form part of the new push to find Madeleine, according to Sky News.

The possible breakthrough has apparently
been warmly received by the McCanns, who are confident that the search 
for their daughter is progressing.

However, police are currently unsure how the man might be connected to the case and are appealing for more witnesses to come forward.

British detectives launched a fresh investigation in July this year - two years into a review of the case - and a BBC Crimewatch appeal on the case is to be aired on Monday.

The appeal will include a reconstruction
of the 'latest, most detailed understanding' of the events around the 
time Madeleine went missing.

Scotland Yard has revealed a comprehensive record log of mobile phone traffic could be the key to finding out what happened to the girl.

Madeleine's parents have said they remain 'optimistic' of finding their daughter and will not accept she is dead until they are presented with clear evidence.

The Metropolitan Police now has a team of six Portuguese detectives based in Faro who are carrying out inquiries on its behalf.

Several e-fits of possible suspects have emerged since Madeleine's disappearance - including one, dubbed the 'egg with hair', which sparked ridicule because of its lack of facial features.

Police refused to release the picture to the public, citing strict Portuguese laws covering investigations, but those who saw it were convinced that it was completely useless.

In January 2008 the McCanns' team released an artist's impression of an olive-skinned man with straggly, collar-length hair and a drooping moustache based on a statement given by a British holidaymaker.

Court case: Gerry McCann pictured in Lisbon outside the libel trial of former police chief Goncalo Amaral

In July 2008 Portuguese authorities 
shelved their investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, and the next
month thousands of pages from the official police files were released.

The
documents included computer-generated e-fits of two suspicious men seen
around Praia da Luz before Madeleine went missing which were never made
public by detectives.

The McCanns are currently suing former Portuguese police chief Goncalo Amaral for libel after he claimed that they were responsible for their daughter's disappearance.

Both Kate and Gerry McCann have asked to give evidence in the trial in Lisbon over the policeman's book, The Truth of the Lie.

The couple say Amaral's allegations that they hid Madeleine's body after she died in an accident, then faked her abduction, damaged the hunt for the girl and exacerbated their grief.
