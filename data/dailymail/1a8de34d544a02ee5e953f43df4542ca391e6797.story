Newcastle's fears that Gabriel Obertan had suffered a serious thigh injury have been realised with the winger set to be sidelined for the next four months.

The 25-year-old pulled up during the first half of Saturday’s 1-0 win over Liverpool and needed lengthy treatment before being taken away on a stretcher.

And following surgery on his torn thigh muscle, Obertan is now unlikely to return before March.

Obertan was carried off on a stretcher and is likely to be sidelined until March

His absence is a blow for manager Alan Pardew, who turned to the out-of-favour Frenchman following the club’s seven-match winless start to the season.

Obertan has since played his part in four straight wins for the Magpies, a run which has seen Pardew nominated for Manager of the Month.

But the United boss will have to negotiate the winter months without the player he signed for £3million from Manchester United in 2011.

Obertan’s injury is likely to open the door for Rolando Aarons, the 18-year-old wideman who was yesterday included in the England Under-20 squad.

Meanwhile, Papiss Cisse is expected to feature at West Brom on Sunday, despite coming off at half-time against Liverpool.

The Senegal striker has been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks related to the broken kneecap he suffered in April.

Cisse did not want to be withdrawn at the break but Pardew overruled his player and introduced match-winner Ayoze Perez. He is, however, set to be included for the trip to the Hawthorns.
