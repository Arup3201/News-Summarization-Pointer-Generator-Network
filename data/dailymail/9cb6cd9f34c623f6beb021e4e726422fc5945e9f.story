Hey, big spender! Lisa Harman is so obsessed with clothes that she's spent a staggering £50,000 on the latest fashion ranges, shoes and handbags

The 25-year-old dedicates at least three hours a day to shopping and has a total of eight store cards to keep up to date with the latest styles.

Single Lisa says past boyfriends have grown tired of her addiction - but now she’s trying to find a man who loves splashing the cash on clothes as much as her.

Can you see the floor? Her rails of clothes and stacks of shoes are rapidly taking over her parents' four-bedroom house

What to wear today...? Single Lisa says past boyfriends have grown tired of her addiction but she's never going to curb her love of shopping

Lisa says she has treated old flames like her personal shoppers - texting them pictures of her favourite clothes and making them go out to buy them for her.

She has filled their homes with her outfits when her four wardrobes are full.

And she says she’s tried to dress them - insisting she won’t be seen out in public with them until they look ‘right’.

Hobby: The shopping lover says she has treated old flames like her personal shoppers and would ask their opinions on her clothing choices 

Finding love: Lisa wants to find a man who loves fashion as much as she does but won't be seen out in public with them until they look 'right'

Credit cards at the ready! The legal secretary loves snapping up the high street's latest offerings but says it has caused issues in her previous relationships 

Keeping track: Despite spending around three quarters of her salary on clothes - she has a special filing system so she can keep track of payments

Lisa said: 'Men don’t really understand my love of clothes. In the early stages of the relationship, they’ve come along to shops with me and have waited patiently outside the changing room.

'But after a while they started to get really annoyed - and it’s often led to arguments.

'I’ve made them do my shopping for me, I’ve had my clothes orders sent to their houses, I’ve even tried to dress them.

'I need to find a man who loves shopping as much as me - but so far I’ve had no joy.'

Judging? Lisa says her family - including identical twin, Kirsty - think her addiction is out of control and want her to cut back on spending

She wouldn't be seen dead in the same outfit twice! Lisa admits that a lot of her clothes have never been worn and she would never consider outfit repeating

Will she ever wear that? The fashionista orders so many outfits online that she can't keep track and forgets what she's bought

To date, legal secretary Lisa, who lives with her mother and stepfather in Hornchurch, Essex, has spent more than £50,000 on her addiction and admits she never wears the same outfit on a night out twice.

The fashionista orders so many outfits online that she can’t keep track and forgets what she’s bought.

She has even ordered clothes after coming home drunk after a night out.

Amazingly, Lisa has never been in debt - despite spending around three quarters of her salary on clothes - and has a special filing system so she can keep track of payments.

Lisa says her family - including identical twin, Kirsty - think her addiction is out of control and want her to cut back on spending.

But she insists she can’t help splashing the cash.

She said: 'I love clothes and shoes and I can’t see myself ever cutting back.

'I work hard for my wages and there are definitely worse ways to waste money.'

Oops! The fashion fan has even been known to order clothes after coming home drunk after a night out

Can't stop, won't stop: Lisa says she won't curb her spending and doesn't she why she has to because she earns her own money and can spend it how she wants
