Newcastle United goalkeeper Rob Elliot has admitted he may need to leave St James' Park in order to earn regular first-team football elsewhere. 

The 28-year-old, who arrived in the North-East from Charlton Athletic, has made just 12 first-team appearances since joining the club back in 2011.

Keen to be a No 1 goalkeeper rather sitting on the bench as Tim Krul's deputy, Elliot admits he may have to reluctantly leave a place where he has settled well in order to achieve this.

Pecking order: Tim Krul (right) is Newcastle's No 1 at the moment and Elliot is frustrated at not playing

The Republic of Ireland international told Sky Sports: 'It's been really tough and I've been a bit frustrated.

'I don’t want to just get the tag of being a No.2 keeper. You get times when you think "I need to play".

'I love it at Newcastle but I want to play football. I hope it is at Newcastle but if it’s not, it’s not.'
