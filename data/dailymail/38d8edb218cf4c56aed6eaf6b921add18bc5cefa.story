A New Yorker has set the record for building the world’s largest gingerbread village after spending the past nine months working on the impressive construct which weighs over 1.5 tons.

Gingerbread Lane as the village is called includes 152 gingerbread houses, 65 trees, four gingerbread cable cars, five gingerbread train cars, an underground candy subway station, candy trees and sugar signage.

It is chef Jon Lovitch’s pride and joy and he estimates that it includes 2,240 pounds of icing, 400 pounds of candy and 500 pounds of gingerbread dough.

Lovitch, 37, started work on the village in February and built it piece by piece in the closet-sized kitchen of his South Bronx apartment using a conventional convection oven that handles one baking pan at a time.

The Guinness Book of World Records last week declared it the world’s largest entirely edible gingerbread exhibit. It is currently on display at the New York Hall of Science in Queens.

All of the pieces were made by Lovitch, usually late at night after returning from his work as the executive sous chef at the New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge.

‘My wife likes the fact that I work on it at home and I’m not out gambling or drinking,’ Lovitch told the New York Times.

He baked the houses one at a time and stored them until recently in an empty bedroom until recently when he started to construct it at the Hall of Science.

The village, which includes an ice rink, a firehouse and the ‘Cinnamon and Nutmeg’ railroad station, will be disassembled after the holiday season.

Lovitch plans to give pieces away to visitors. He paid for it himself and admits it cost ‘a few grand.’

‘I save money on ingredients by shopping when I’m out of town,’ he said. ‘I look for rural grocery stores and just clean them out, of their flour or candy or sugar or whatever.’

Ultimately, Lovitch would like to make a living solely off making, and teaching, gingerbread construction.

‘Being a chef, people may remember my meals for a day or two, but with the gingerbread, I can get thousands of people at a time checking out my work,’ he said. ‘I’ve gotten emails a year later, thanking me for it.’
