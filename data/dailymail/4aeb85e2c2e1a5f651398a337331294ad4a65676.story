Jeremy Paxman has admitted that Newsnight viewers would sometimes do better to turn off the television and go to bed rather than watch the programme.

The anchor of BBC2's flagship news broadcast revealed that on some nights he wanted to say, 'Not much happened today' - but added that he would feel guilty about betraying his colleagues if he did so.

The presenter's comments came during a wide-ranging interview in which Mr Paxman suggested that the current 'cosseted' generation might benefit from National Service, and said that he feels guilty about never serving in the Armed Forces.

Nothing on? Jeremy Paxman admits that sometimes he wants to tell Newsnight viewers to stop watching

Last year, Newsnight's editor made headlines by tweeting that one of the guests on his own show was 'boring snoring'.

And
 Mr Paxman appears to support that view some of the time, telling the 
Radio Times that on slow news days it is hardly worth watching the 
programme.

'News is not
 easily predicted and a certain amount of time has to be filled,' the 
63-year-old said. 'I'd often like to see the presenter say, "Not much 
happened today, so I'd go to bed if I were you."

'I've
 often felt like that on Newsnight. I wouldn't do it, because it's 
disloyal to colleagues who have slaved long and hard to make bricks 
without straw. That's the nature of journalism.'

However,
 the veteran broadcaster denied the suggestion that he fails to hide his
 boredom on camera, saying: 'I can't help my face. It's long, and I can 
do nothing about it.'

And
 he dismissed criticism that the programme has dumbed down thanks to 
recent segments such as a long interview with comedian Russell Brand and
 presenter Kirsty Wark dancing to Thriller on Halloween.

Controversy: The presenter's interview with comedian Russell Brand was criticised by some viewers

Reflecting
 on the furore cause by his decision to grow a beard last summer, Mr 
Paxman said he was ‘naïve’ not to expect the attention, adding it was 
‘absurd, but funny’.

In
 September last year, Newsnight editor Ian Katz caused controversy when 
he accidentally sent out a Twitter message describing one guest, Labour 
frontbencher Rachel Reeves, as 'boring snoring'.

The
 show boss, who joined after the previous editor was forced to resign 
over the Jimmy Savile scandal, apologised for the blunder.

In
 the Radio Times interview, Mr Paxman revealed his guilt at having such a
 privileged life while his parents’ generation had to fight in the 
Second World War.

The presenter - whose father Keith served in the North Atlantic convoys - said conscription and National Service taught the importance of duty, whereas modern generations are ‘cosseted’ and expected to do nothing but ‘gratify themselves’.

Dumbing down? Mr Paxman denied that segments such as Kirsty Wark's Thriller dance proved Newsnight's standards were slipping

He said: ‘I’d have done better for 
having time in uniform. The more we see of other members of our society,
 we realise we’re all human beings with the same hopes and fears.

‘I’m not arguing in favour of National Service, but I feel in awe of my parents’ generation who had to do that, and a bit guilty having such a privileged life. We’ve had it pretty easy and never been tested.

‘Obviously I’m not wishing war on anyone, but it might have been better for all of us if we’d been obliged to do something rather than choosing for ourselves.

'It’s difficult to comprehend today a society where people were expected to do things other than gratify themselves.'

Reflecting on the First World War, he said: ‘It’s such an imaginative leap from our cosseted, indulged lives to something other than the achievement of personal pleasure. That’s really why people find it so hard to come to terms with the War.’

Reintroduced before the Second World War in 1939, National Service ended in the UK in 1960, when Mr Paxman was 10.

'In awe': Mr Paxman spoke of his respect for those who were obliged to fight, such as these British infantrymen at the Battle of the Somme

Asked about the case of Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman, who last December was sentenced to life for killing a wounded Taliban insurgent in 2011, the interviewer said those who have not fought for their country should not judge those who have.

He said: ‘It’s not attractive seeing people who have never been in extremis passing judgment on others who have. Who knows how we’d behave? Imagine seeing your best friend blown to pieces, unable even to retrieve the body for burial.'

Next week, Mr Paxman’s new TV series Britain’s Great War will start the BBC’s four-year commemoration of the First World War centenary.

In recent months, the presenter has been embroiled in a row with Education Secretary Michael Gove, who said hit sitcom Blackadder perpetuated a ‘myth’ that the War was a ‘misbegotten shambles’.

Mr Paxman also commented on Mr Brand, who called for a revolution and told people not to vote in a Newsnight interview . He said: ‘He’s not full of rubbish. His diagnosis of disenchantment with politicians is spot on, but his prescription won’t work. There’ll be a government whether or not you vote, so why absent yourself?

'If you don't take part, you'd better belt up and not grumble. There should be a place on the ballot paper for "None of the above", and if enough people filled that in, the system might start to change.

'But we're stuck with what we have and I can't think of a better one, although I find the whole green-bench pantomime at Westminster a bit silly. You and I don't have to stand on our hind legs and make speeches. We can have a civilised discussion.'
