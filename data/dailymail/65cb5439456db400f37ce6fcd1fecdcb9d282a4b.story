Water death: Jacob Cockle, 28, died after being dragged out of the water near the Hayle Estuary in Cornwall

A photographer drowned taking close-up pictures of a whirlpool just seconds after he apparently told friends 'I just want one more phoograph'.

Jacob Cockle, 28, was trying to capture footage of the dangerous tidal phenomenon at the Carnsew Pool in the Hayle Estuary, Cornwall.

The disused man-made waterway was constructed by the Victorians in 1830 and was originally built to flush sand from the harbour.

Friends say Jacob was in the water to take photographs of the large, fast-moving whirlpools it creates when he was sucked under.

But they claimed he was pulled into the swirling vortex of water when he paddled too close to get the perfect photo.

Jacob was pulled out of the water before RNLI lifeboat crews tried to revive him. He was airlifted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where he was later pronounced dead

Lee Harvey, 35, a close friend of him for 20 years, said Jacob, of Penzance, Cornwall, was taking still photographs while his friend filmed him.

But he says Jacob fatally went back for more photos and drowned at around 9pm on Tuesday.

Lee said: 'Jacob was one of the friendliest, happiest and loving person you could ever meet. It is very hard to take.

'Jacob is a body boarder although he loved surfing and would also do that, he also loved filming whirlpools, which is what I believe happened.

'He went to the pools with a guy who he goes out there with - he isn't reckless. Jacob said he was going back for just one more photo.

'But then the guy lost sight of him and he went towards the centre of the whirlpools.

'The next thing he came out the other side and was unconscious. It is just such a tragedy and so hard to take.'

Jacob's mother Carolyn Sheard, 58, said : 'All I can say is imagine if it was your child, we are obviously absolutely devastated.

'He was a friend of everybody, he had so many friends and he held no grudges against any person at all. He lived life to the full.'

The whirlpools are now part of a nature reserve but residents say while the water looks tempting to bathers the swirls are too powerful for even the strongest of swimmers.

A spokesperson for the RNLI said: 'Being the first emergency services on the scene, the volunteer lifeboat crew immediately began giving CPR to the casualty who was unconscious when they arrived.

'After approximately five minutes the search and rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose also arrived on scene, after which the casualty was handed to the care of the helicopter crew and taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro.'

Police have appealed for witnesses to the tragic 9pm incident but are not treating it as suspicious.

A
 spokesman added: 'It is believed the male
 may have been swimming in or near an area renowned for whirlpools.'

Tragedy: Mr Cockle, 28, drowned in Carnsew Pool, near Hoyle, Cornwall

In December 2008 Jacob, of Hayle, cheated death while surfing after becoming trapped between a stone pier and a freak 30ft wave.

He almost drowned when the monster wave emerged from nowhere and charged towards him at speeds of more than 40mph.

Clinging helplessly to his board, he was tossed into the air 'like a rag doll' when the wave - with a mass of seven tonnes - broke over him at Newlyn, near Penzance in Cornwall.

His work has also previously featured on the Mail Online.

Andy Hughes, a former friend from the Royal College of Art, said on Facebook: 'We remember Jacob at college and have one of his great photographs on permanent display.

'I remember looking at his underwater shots, he was very good and will be missed by many'.

Georgie Burdett wrote: 'RIP Jacob Cockle. Beautiful soul, positive personality, fantastic surfer, amazing photographer, all round good guy taken to soon'.

Detective Constable Damien Ayling, of Devon and Cornwall Police, warned that whirlpools are highly dangerous.

'This
 is a very dangerous area to swim. The amount of water and the speed of 
the water is dangerous for anyone, no matter how strong that person 
thinks they are at swimming, or no matter what equipment they use in the
 water,' he told ITV News.

David
 Walker, leisure safety manager for the Royal Society for the Prevention
 of Accidents, said: 'In general, currents can catch out even the most 
experienced swimmers.

'For
 holidaymakers looking for somewhere to swim, it is worth swimming on 
beaches with lifeguards and between the safety flags. Also ask advice 
about prevailing conditions and swimming information about the area.'
