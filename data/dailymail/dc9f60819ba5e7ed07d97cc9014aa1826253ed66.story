Andy Murray has a season-defining fortnight ahead of him; the month of January will certainly go some way to teeing up the rest of the year.

It is one of the most important starts to a calendar the Scot's ever encountered - and he's putting in the hard work to make sure he doesn't come up short, although he appears to have turned into Danny Cipriani given his latest Instagram picture. 

This snap looks rather like the fly-half - but the star on the physio bed is someone who has excelled far more in their field.

Murray is the man ironing out any potential problems before the Australian Open in Melbourne, which starts a week on Monday.

The Scot, who was knocked out in the quarter-finals Down Under this time 12 months ago, warms up for Great Britain this week.

Murray is playing alongside Heather Watson at the Hopman Cup in Perth, with GB having won once and lost once thus far. 

The pair take on hosts Australia on Friday before Murray travels east for the first Grand Slam of the year.

He has enjoyed a good start to season, winning the Mubadala World Tennis Championships exhibition event in Abu Dhabi last week, albeit opponent Novak Djokovic was forced to withdraw before the final due to illness.
