Sued: Kris Humphries is being sued by a woman who claims he gave her Herpes

He is in the midst of a messy divorce battle with estranged wife Kim Kardashian.

But now Kris Humphries is facing even more legal troubles.

The NBA star is being sued by a woman who claims he gave her Herpes after they spent the night together two years ago.

According to legal documents obtained by Radar Online, Kayla Goldberg is suing the 27-year-old for sexual battery.

The woman claims the pair met on 
August 31 2010 - two months before he met Kardashian - at Los Angeles café The Newsroom and met up later that 
night at Trousdale nightclub.

The pair then allegedly went to Humphries’ hotel room at The Thompson where they had unprotected sex.

The court documents state the two ‘had 
sexual intercourse more than once’ and ‘Defendant Humphries did not at 
any time inform Plaintiff that he was infected with the incurable 
venereal disease, Herpes Simplex Virus.’

Goldberg claims she was ‘free of any 
venereal diseases at the time she commenced her intimate relationship 
with Kris Humphries’ and developed symptoms four or five days later 
before being diagnosed on September 8.

However
reports have now emerged that Humphries is claiming to friends there is
no way he could have given Goldberg Herpes, because he apparently 
recently tested negative for the sexually transmitted disease.

Tryst: Kris allegedly had unprotected sex with Kayla Goldberg on August 31, 2010 - exactly one year before this photo of him with then-wife Kim Kardashain was taken

A source told Radar Online: ‘Kris was recently accused by another woman of giving her Herpes, this happened within the last two months.

‘Kris tested negative for it though and for any other sexually transmitted disease and he is absolutely steadfast that he has never given anyone Herpes.’

And the insider alleges that Humphries won’t be going down without a fight and may counter-sue.

Biting back: Reports have emerged that the NBA star, pictured in November 2010, may counter-sue for defamation

The source said: ‘Kris plans on vigorously fighting the lawsuit filed against him by Kayla Goldberg and is considering counter-suing her for defamation.’

They added: ‘Kris will take the advice of his lawyers, but he absolutely wants to take legal action against Kayla Goldberg for her actions and this lawsuit.’

Humphries married Kardashian one year after the alleged illicit encounter on August 20, 2011. The reality star famously filed for divorce just 72 days later.
