Toddler Gavin Foust lives his life by one rule and one rule only: he does NOT share pizza.

With any other food the two-year-old is the picture of generosity, but when pizza is on the menu, the stubborn youngster will defend his plate with uncompromising passion and purpose.

And as this hilarious video shows, two-year-old Gavin won't even let his father, Tyler, swipe a slice, yelling 'no' and putting up a firm hand each time he approaches.

'He will sit there and eat half a pizza in one sitting, but don't even think about getting the other half - he won't let you anywhere near it.
