Former Manchester United and Everton defender Phil Neville is more used to putting his kit on but it seems wife Julie has gone the other way by removing all her clothes.

Julie Neville decided to go nude in an advertising campaign to help launch her new health shop in Manchester's Arndale Centre.

She has even successfully converted husband Phil to vegetarianism, and she supplies the England team and several Premier League clubs with supplements.

The shop, Win Naturally, is due to open on Saturday and Mrs Neville wanted to show that you can be fit and healthy naturally, so she stripped down to show off her physique.

The 38-year-old told the Manchester Evening News: 'Nowadays people are always looking for quick fixes – be it ready meals, weight loss or recovering from illness, and are too keen to put food and chemicals into their body without thinking about the long-term consequences.

'The idea behind the naked photo shoot was to highlight there are ways to be the way we want to be but naturally – the way nature intended.' 

When asked about why he had embraced his wife's healthy methods, Phil Neville said: 'I started to feel healthier, leaner. I started to feel great. You can get your proteins, you can get every kind of nutritional values in vegetarian dishes.'

Julie Neville, a mother-of-two, suffered complications during the birth of the couple's second child, Isabella, and she became determined not to be stuck on medication so she changed her diet and added natural supplements to it.

Her first shop was opened in the Trafford Centre in 2013 and she began the business online in 2011.
