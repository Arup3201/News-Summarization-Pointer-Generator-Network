Quiz show king: David St John, 64, has appeared on 28 television quiz shows over 31 years

For more than 30 years, no one has questioned his passion for entering TV quiz shows. In fact, David St John claims to be Britain’s most prolific contestant.

The trivia-mad 64-year-old has racked up 27 appearances on game shows including 15 to 1, Eggheads, The Chase and The Weakest Link.

He first put his grey matter – and his seemingly unchanging hairstyle – to the test on TV in 1982 on Sale Of The Century, and won two motorcycles.

It was the beginning of an obsession that has seen the married father of two from Cannock, Staffordshire, crowned champion on nine different shows.

He even travelled to Australia to take part in an Ashes-style clash of Sale Of The Century champions in 1986, where team mates included future Egghead Daphne Fowler.

Over the decades, Mr St John, a professional comedy entertainer, reckons he has won about £5,000 in cash, holidays and other prizes.

His latest appearance was last week on Face The Clock, hosted by impressionist Rory Bremner, although he lost.

‘I love taking part in any TV quiz show and to win is a bonus,’ he says. ‘If I lose then it makes me more determined to win the next one.’

He has sometimes been a victim of his success. ‘I did get voted off the Weakest Link quite quickly as some of the other contestants recognised me and saw me as a threat. That was probably the worst experience. But that’s the nature of the game.’

In 1990 Mr St John competed on Gyles Brandreth’s quiz and talent show Star Quality. But his favourite appearance was on Wipeout in 1998, when he got to meet his comedy hero Bob Monkhouse.

Losing on Face The Clock has, typically, only whetted his appetite for more. ‘My holy grail is Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,’ he says. ‘It’s the ultimate TV quiz.’

'I've always had my nose in some book or other and I always loved exams.  I love taking part in any TV quiz show and to win is a bonus.  If I lose then it makes me more determined to win the next one.

'I've always loved learning. I used to really enjoy exams: people thought I was mad.

'I'm also comfortable in front of the camera as I've been performing since I was 10.  I just generally have a thirst for knowledge.'

Mr St John, who is married to Maria, 
59, and has two daughters, says his family are very supportive of his 
passion for gameshows.

'Maria doesn't mind, especially when I come home with a few bob,' he said.

He added: 'Bob Monkhouse was a comedy
hero of mine so it was a pleasure to meet him. He was a really top guy.
An absolute legend.

'Nicholas Parsons is also an iconic figure of the quiz show genre. Those two are definitely my favourite.

'But Sale Of The Century is my 
favourite, I think. It was just such a classic and regularly gets voted 
in the greatest of all time.
