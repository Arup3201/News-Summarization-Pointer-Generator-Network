An e-fit of one of the two suspects police believe is responsible for a chemical assault - during which a 56-year-old victim was badly hurt

Police have issued an e-fit of a suspect believed to have left a disabled man with ‘life-changing’ injuries following a chemical attack - believed to be a case of mistaken identity.

The 56-year-old, who has not been named, was reportedly assaulted with the 'harmful' liquid at the modern three-storey block in Witham, Essex, at around 10.45am on Friday - as he collected his post.

The victim, who believe he was not the intended target, encountered two men banging on the main door.

Following a brief exchange the two men threw the harmful liquid, which was in a bottle, over the man and ran off.

The victim was taken to Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital with serious injuries to his face and hands, while police immediately cordoned off the area to members of the public.

Despite neighbours describing the attack as 'targeted', police confirmed this evening that the victim had not been the intended target.

He remains in hospital receiving treatment for his burns.

DS Becky Young said: 'We believe this e-fit to bear a strong likeness to the man involved. He had a distinctive braided hairstyle and we are sure if anyone knows this man they will recognise this picture.

'As we have indicated already the information that we currently have suggests that the victim was not the intended target of this attack.

'The two suspects are described as a white man and a black man and if anyone saw them either in the area prior to this attack or afterwards we would urgently like to speak to them.'

Cordons initially put in place in the road have now been released but police have today been carrying out further house to house enquiries in the Bramble Road area.

Six fire engines and an air ambulance were called to the scene in Bramble Road following the incident, while the East of England Ambulance Service Trust also dispatched its Hazardous Area Response Team.

On Friday afternoon detectives and forensic officers were seen going in and out of a ground-floor flat in the block.

Donning protective clothing, they bagged up a number of items from the communal entrance to the block, including a drink bottle.

The post boxes outside the doorway were also swabbed, while a Police Community Support Officer was posted outside a ground-floor flat to the rear of the building.

A neighbour claimed the two male suspects had appeared to 'target' their victim.

The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It was a definitely a targeted attack. We saw the car pull up and two men get out.

'They definitely weren't from round here. The police have told us not to say anything more though I am afraid.'

Response: Six fire engines, paramedics and an air ambulance attended the scene in Bramble Road

Inspector Dean Stratford, of Essex Police, described the incident as an 'assault' on the day of the incident and said 'chemicals were involved'.

'A man has been assaulted and chemicals were involved,' he said. 'We're making sure the area is safe for the public and the cordon will be in place until that time,' he added.

'At the moment we're trying to ascertain the circumstances around what happened and the investigation is ongoing.'

Another neighbour said the attack had come as a 'surprise', saying: 'I've lived here for two years and there's never been any trouble.

'It's a nice area. I don't know the people who live there but it's come as a real surprise.'

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Police were notified by the ambulance service at 10.45am today that a man had suffered injuries at an address in Bramble Road, Witham.

'Officers attended to find that the man had suffered injuries to his hands and face consistent with the use of a harmful liquid.

'The air ambulance were called to the scene but the man was subsequently taken to Broomfield Hospital for treatment by road ambulance.

'The man’s injuries are not believed to be life threatening, but are potentially life-changing.'

Police are now appealing for witnesses to the incident.
