Sunderland striker Connor Wickham could follow Jack Colback to Newcastle United this summer.

The 21-year-old has one year to run on his current deal and has not been offered a new contract – this despite manager Gus Poyet issuing the player with an ultimatum last week.

The Uruguayan said: 'For me, Connor’s situation is clear. He needs to sign a new contract or we let him go – we sell him. There is nothing in between.'

Deal or no deal: Connor Wickham could head to Newcastle if Sunderland don't offer him a new deal

But Sportsmail can reveal that no new terms have been put to Wickham and this has alerted North-East rivals Newcastle, who are in the market for another forward.

United boss Alan Pardew tried to sign him in 2011 and was manager of Reading when the youngster played in their academy.

West Ham are also monitoring the situation and Wickham – who lives in Newcastle - could be available for around £6million, £2m less than the fee Sunderland paid Ipswich Town three years ago.

Will he stay or will he go? Sunderland are keen to keep Wickham after he scored some important goals last season

The England Under-21 star scored the goals which kept the Black Cats in the Premier League last season and he is happy at the Stadium of Light.

However, the club's failure to offer him a new deal has left him considering his options.

Sunderland, though, can ill afford to lose another first-team player with Phil Bardsley, Craig Gardner, David Vaughan and Colback having already left since the end of last season.

Reunited: Alan Pardew was manager of Reading when Wickham was in the academy there

Colback joined the Magpies on a free transfer after his contract expired but Sunderland will not allow the same situation to unfold with Wickham - although being under 24 compensation would be due - and he will be sold if an agreement is not reached.
