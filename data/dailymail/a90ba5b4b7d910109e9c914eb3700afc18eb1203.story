The Californian Democrat, 41, with the help of Mr Gallego, 51, used a defibrillator to restart the heart of the passenger, thought to be in his 60s, and give oxygen.

'I'm an emergency medicine physician by heart, and my spirit felt alive, I was in my element. I was providing emergency care to somebody who needed it at the time and it felt real good,' Ruiz told NBC 5 DFW after the plane landed in Dallas.

As the mid-air drama unfolded on Thursday evening, Mr Gallego tweeted: 'Medical emergency on flight from DC to TX. Passenger collapses. @Congressmanruiz, an MD, on board. Passenger stabilized. Landing in Raleigh.'He added in another tweet: 'Hope @Congressmanruiz is on all my flights home! An emergency room Dr by training, was impressive to see him in action. He saves lives!'

The flight was diverted to nearby Raleigh airport where the ill passenger was taken to hospital. It is understood he was conscious and talking to medics when he was taken from the plane.

Mr Ruiz is the latest congressman to intervene in a medical emergency.

According to Politico website, in September 2011, Phil Roe, R-Tenn., an obstetrician by trade who served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, helped revive a man who suffered a heart attack.

He performed CPR and used a defibrillator to restart his heart at the Charlotte, N.C., airport.

On Aug. 26, last year, Andy Harris, a Republican from Maryland, was able to revive a toddler who appeared to have stopped breathing during a seizure.

In 1998, then-Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a former heart and lung transplant surgeon, performed lifesaving measures on a gunman who was wounded after killing two on-duty Capitol Police officers.
