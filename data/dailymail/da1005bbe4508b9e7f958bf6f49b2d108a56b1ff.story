Choosing Christmas gifts can either be the best or the worst part of the festive season, depending on who you are buying for. 

But a new app is aiming to take all of the stress out of picking the right present by using the information from a person's Twitter page. 

Clubcardsecretscanta.com from Tesco searches through a person's tweets and then picks out a present depending on the types of messages that person sends.

Femail decided to to try the site out by picking some well-known celebrities and politicians and seeing what they would end up with. 

Some of the results were surprisingly apt, For instance, the well-read Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was recommended the board game Articulate. 

Selfie-lover Kim Kardashian was matched to a high-end camera so that she can continue to document her glamorous lifestyle on Instagram.
