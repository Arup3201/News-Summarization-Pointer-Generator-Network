A 63-year-old woman has been fined £2,250 and could receive ASBO for refusing to trim a 32ft garden hedge by 6ft.

Sheila Spiers has been given one month to cut the tree that is said to block sunlight from her neighbour's gardens in Evesham, Worcerstershire.

She said she won't do so because cutting the tree would destroy the habitats of birds and bats who nest in it.

The 32ft confier towers over 63-year-old Sheila Spiers. She refuses to cut it by the recommended amount because of the birds that nest in it

Miss Spiers said: 'I would rather be given an ASBO than kill the birds and the bats.

'I
will not cut them down because I do not want to destroy the pigeons 
which are nesting there and the bats which I see roosting in the 
branches.

'The whole thing has been ridiculous, there needs to be some kind of inquiry into how these councils are acting.

'I had someone come round last 
September, he had got most of the way through when he found a nest with 
some fledgling pigeons in it and we couldn't do it legally.'

Miss Spiers, who works as an administator for a financial advisor, was ordered to reduce the height of her hedge by May 2012 under the Anti-Social Behaviour Act.

The 63-year-old said in return that she would be 
breaching the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act which forbids the 
cutting of vegetation during the nesting season.

'The council claimed cutting off just six feet would solve the problem,' she said.

'You
aren't allowed to cut the trees when nesting birds are around between 
May and August due to the Wildlife and Countryside Act.'

Miss Spiers' neighbours have complained that the hedge blocks sunlight and leaves their gardens in darkness for two hours a day

The tree leans over Miss Spiers' garden fence. The 63-year-old was ordered to reduce its height by May last year

District Judge 
Nigel Cadbury fined Miss Spiers £250 last Friday at Worcester 
Magistrates Court for deliberately preventing work from being carried 
out.

She was ordered to pay £2,000 court costs 
and a £15 victim surcharge.

She was given 28 days 
to cut the hedge or risk further legal action which could include being 
slapped with an ASBO.

Miss Spiers said: 'The council claim they are a hedge 
which are subject to height restrictions but I maintain they are trees 
which do not need to be cut.

'The thing is the trees don't even 
boarder my neighbour's garden and they have never been cut into a hedge 
so shouldn't be classed as such.

Graeme Duerden, Development Control 
Officer at Wychavon District Council, said: 'In this case the defendant wilfully ignored our advice and offered no evidence to support her lack of co-operation."

These images show the scale of the problem. Miss Spiers said the tree should not be classified as a hedge because it does not boarder on her neighbour's garden

Miss Spiers has live in the £200,00 semi-detached house in Evesham, Worcestershire for ten years. She was first advised to cut the tree in September 2011
