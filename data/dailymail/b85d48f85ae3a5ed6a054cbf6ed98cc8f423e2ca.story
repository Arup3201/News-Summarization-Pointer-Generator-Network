Cristiano Ronaldo has gone almost a year without scoring a free-kick in La Liga despite being Real Madrid’s designated taker, and supporters are now asking if the ball shouldn’t be taken off the Portuguese and given to Gareth Bale.

The 30-year-old last hit the back of the net from a set-piece in the Spanish league on March 26 last year against Sevilla. His last goal from a free-kick in any competition came in the Champions League last April against Bayern Munich.

He has now failed to score a single goal with any of his last 51 free-kicks.

In any straw poll of best set-piece deliverers Ronaldo would be top of many people’s lists but the statistics tell a completely different story, and while his figures are poor Bale’s are far more impressive.

Ronaldo has sent 21 of his efforts straight into the wall and placed 14 high or wide of the target; while keepers or posts and crossbars have done for the rest. Gareth Bale has only scored once this season but it is Real’s only goal scored from a free-kick. 

And although Bale insisted recently on Spanish radio that he tends to take the kicks that favour a left-footer and Ronaldo those that favour a right foot, more often than not it is the Portuguese who takes precedence.

When Bale scored from a free-kick against Espanyol in January the strike-rates of Europe’s set-piece specialists were published by Spanish football statistician Mister Chip and they made tough reading for Ronaldo.

Bale scores a free-kick every 9.5 attempts while Ronaldo's ratio is one every 15.6 attempts. Bale also came out ahead of Andrea Pirlo who scores one every 10.5 attempts and Leo Messi who scores every 14 times he takes a free-kick.

Madrid have various options from a dead ball with Toni Kroos and Isco both ready to step in. 

They also have James Rodriguez and Sergio Ramos on their way back from injury to put more pressure on Ronaldo, and with Martin Odegaard being tipped to play some part in Real’s Champions League second leg with Schalke on Tuesday there is even a 16-year-old pretender to the crown.
