A 24-year-old man has become a prisoner in his own home because he suffers from a rare condition that means his bones won't stop growing - and he has grown out of his wheelchair.

Robert Smith suffers from proteus syndrome, which causes his ones and skin to grow in an abnormal way. 

The devastating condition is thought to 
have afflicted Joseph Merrick, famously dubbed the Elephant Man, in the 
late 19th century.

Robert Smith, 24, has died at his home in Cambridgeshire, having suffered a massive heart attack despite his mother Rita's desperate attempts to save his life

Robert, who weighs 19 stone, has size 16 feet and a 40-inch inside leg, also has sight and hearing problems. To date, he has undergone a staggering 74 operations.

He also suffers from gigantism, which means at 7 ft tall he is still growing, along with hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain) and epilepsy.

Since suffering from meningitis three years ago, when he was unconscious for seven weeks, he has been unable to walk.

Family and friends from Walsoken, near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, are now desperately fundraising to buy him a new £8,000 wheelchair - because he has grown out of his current one.

Robert's mother Rita, 66, his main carer, said: 'Robert has only been out four times in three years - I can't push him out because he is too big and heavy.

Proteus syndrome, thought to affect only a few hundred people worldwide, results in bone overgrowth.

The word 'Proteus' comes from the name of the ancient Greek god of change.

This overgrowth is usually asymmetrical, so corresponding body parts are not affected in the same way.

Robert, for example, has 21 more bones in his hand than he should - and, as a result, suffers a great deal of pain.

More men are affected than women and the cause is unknown.

The syndrome became more widely known when it was determined that Joseph Merrick (the patient depicted in the play and film 'The Elephant Man') had severe Proteus syndrome rather than Neurofibromatosis, as had been suggested previously.

Mrs Smith, who manages to look after her son despite 
battling osteoporosis, arthritis, high cholesterol and high blood 
pressure herself, added: 'A motorised wheelchair would totally transform our lives.'

'The longer Robert is forced to spend in the house, the more depressed he is becoming.'

Robert added: 'I just want to go out 
with my sister Marie Louise and visit Asda in Wisbech to buy some DVDs, 
CDs and chocolate caramel sweets.'

Robert was born a month prematurely 
at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, Norfolk, and it was 
immediately clear he was unwell.

'He was born by Caesarean section and doctors said he would only live for a month,' said Mrs Smith.

Robert was diagnosed with hydrocephalus and taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.

He started fitting as a baby and had eight shunts draining fluid from his brain by the time he was two.

At the age of 10 he had a titanium plate inserted into his head, before being diagnosed with Proteus syndrome at 16.

Robert's mother Rita, 66, his main carer, said: 'I can¿t believe he has gone. I was on my own with him at the time - and I¿m absolutely devastated. I don¿t know what I¿ll do without him'

Proteus syndrome, thought to affect 120 people worldwide, results in bone 
overgrowth. This overgrowth is usually asymmetrical, so corresponding body parts are not affected in the same way.

Robert, for example, has 21 more bones in his hand than he should - and, as a result, suffers a great deal of pain. 

'His knees and elbows are also very large and his skin is so thin that only a tap will make it rip,' his mother explained.

Such is the level of care he needs that his mother sleeps next to him in a recliner chair.

'The only respite I have is when a carer sits with Robert for three hours, once a week,' she said.

'But I wouldn't change Robert for the world - he is a gentle giant and very loving.'

'It will be wonderful when we get the wheelchair.'
