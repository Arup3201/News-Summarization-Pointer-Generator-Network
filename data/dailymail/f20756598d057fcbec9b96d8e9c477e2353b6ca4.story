A high school journalism teacher has shot dead her former police officer ex-husband after an argument during a messy split, police have said.

Cara Ryan, 45, killed John Joseph Rush, also 45, at her home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida around 11pm on Saturday.

The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office initially said the shooting occurred during a domestic dispute and they did not bring any charges, but on Friday, they said that Ryan had been arrested.

The sheriff said he would share more details about the incident at a press conference on Friday afternoon.

Authorities previously said they had been arguing before the shooting, Fox 13 reported.

The couple, who have a grown daughter together, had divorced in 2003 but then they later moved back in with each other, Fox reported.

But Rush's family told the channel that the relationship had soured again in recent months and he had moved out of the home in February. It was not clear why he returned at the weekend. 

Rush, known to friends as 'JJ', had retired from the  St Petersburg Police, where he had worked in the forensic unit, with an injury following an on-duty car crash in 2005.

Afterwards he went to work for the county medical examiner's officer, family members said.

Sergeant Joe Pratt, who had worked with Rush, said he was stunned that his friend, who had survived working a dangerous job, was ultimately killed at home, WTSP reported. 

'Something like this, you just never anticipate, so it's really a shock when something like this happens to someone you know and care about and has been a part of your life the past 25 years,' he said.

Ryan, who owns the home where he was shot, is a media production teacher at Clearwater High School. According to her LinkedIn page, she has been with the school district for two decades.

Her Facebook profile features a picture of her and her ex-husband sitting close together and looking into each other's eyes. Another image shows them walking on a beach with their daughter.

On a gofundme page set up in her father's memory, their daughter Meghan paid tribute to his service. The page has raised more than $5,000 of a $10,000 goal.

'The unexpected death of John has been an emotional roller coaster for our family,' she wrote.

'We are all proud of John’s service and we always greatly appreciate the day to day sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make just like John has.'
