Princess Diana’s step-brother last night revealed he had been arrested following a domestic dispute during which his wife called the police.

The Earl of Dartmouth, 63, was taken into custody on suspicion of assault following the late-night incident in November, during which officers were called to the couple’s flat in the fashionable Bayswater district of London.

He was not charged, and yesterday described the event as the ‘worst day of my life’.

Dispute: The Earl of Dartmouth, seen with his wife Fiona, was taken into custody on suspicion of assault following the late-night incident in November

His wife Fiona, a former model, insisted she had called the police after becoming ‘disorientated’, adding that ‘nothing had happened’.

The Earl, a hereditary peer and member of the European Parliament for the UK Independence Party, spoke out after details of the incident began to emerge.

A friend said the couple had had a row on the evening of November 15 over an apparently innocuous decision about which room the television should be put in at their home in Devon.

Lady Dartmouth went to bed and fell into a ‘deep sleep’. But the Earl later wanted to pursue the matter and ‘shook her awake’.

The friend insisted there was no physical altercation and said the couple had not been drinking.

The Earl of Dartmouth is the son of Raine McCorquodale, who was Princess Diana's step-mother

He said the couple were ‘very close’, adding that they were due to travel to Strasbourg together this weekend.

In a statement yesterday the Earl said: ‘After my wife went to bed I decided to wake her and clarify my point of view. Looking back it was an unwise thing to do as Fiona was deeply asleep and became disorientated. Her alarm resulted in a call to the police.

‘By the time the police arrived, there was no issue. Fiona told them repeatedly she did not wish to take the matter further and there had been no physical altercation.

‘The police attempted to persuade her to say she had been assaulted and she should press charges even though we both separately explained it was just the sort of disagreement which often happens within a marriage.

They then placed me under arrest and I was held for several hours until they realised nothing of consequence had occurred and no charges could be made.’

Lady Dartmouth said: ‘When William woke me from a deep sleep I was rather disorientated and rang the police.

‘When they arrived I emphasised I was never going to press any charges because absolutely nothing had happened.’

The Earl of Dartmouth’s mother, Raine McCorquodale, divorced his father in 1976 and married the then Earl Spencer later that year, becoming Lady Diana Spencer’s step-mother in the process. Lady Dartmouth was born Fiona Campbell, in Melbourne, Australia.

Her first husband, Matt Handbury, is Rupert Murdoch’s nephew, son of Geoff Handbury and Helen Murdoch. The couple divorced in 2000 and she married the Earl of Dartmouth in 2009.

A friend last night said Lord Dartmouth had not ruled out a complaint against the police over the apparent leak of information about the incident.

A UKIP source described the incident as a ‘private matter’.
