The wintry conditions claimed the life of a 37-year-old man today who reportedly fell through a frozen lake in East Dunbartonshire after trying to rescue his dog who had gone into the water.

Strathclyde Police said the man's body was recovered from the Gadloch in Lenzie following an extensive search involving divers and a police helicopter.

Police said investigations are continuing but they believe it was an accident and there were no suspicious circumstances.

The incident in central Scotland came after thermometers hit -5C in Eskdalemuir yesterday, and there were gloves and scarves abound as far south as Benson, where the temperature reached -4.7C

The surges of snow as we head towards December 25 had led some bookmakers to slash the odds of a white Christmas at the end of last week, with Ladbrokes offering a 3/1 chance that London will have snow on the big day, while the odds were 9/4 for Edinburgh and Glasgow.

However, there was precious little 
snow around the UK with only the Highlands of Scotland and North and 
West Wales seeing much in the way of truly white weather. And
 the forecast for the weeks ahead is milder, with a much drier and 
brighter day across the country today with wintry showers less 
widespread and frequent.

The
 East of the country can expect to see the best of the sunshine, but it 
will stay staying cold for everyone who is chilled by the northwesterly 
wind. Despite
 the milder conditions, however, Christmas shoppers and motorists were 
still warned they could expect treacherous driving conditions.

'It
 is getting milder, particularly from midweek onwards so it will be 
quite clear with fewer wintry showers,' said Met Office forecaster 
Michael Lawrence.Â 

'There is rain on the way and we are expecting a milder wind direction. There
 are still some patches of high pressure coming in from the Atlantic, 
and we can't rule out the chances of a white Christmas in some places, 
but the signs are at the moment are that it won't be a white Christmas 
for the majority of us.'

Despite the worst of weather predictions not coming to pass this weekend there were still major problems on the roads. Treacherous icy conditions left two 
motorist in hospital after a five car pile-up on the A41, in Kingswood, 
near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

The
collision happened as dozens of other drivers were crashing and sliding
off the roads as a result of black ice across the South East of 
England.

A man and a woman 
were taken to hospital suffering from an arm injuries and cuts after the
vehicles skidded into each other on the ice covered route.

It
 happened just before 9am and involved a a green BMW 520, a black Ford 
KA, a red Ford KA, a black Toyota Corolla, and a black BMW 320.

The road was closed down for several hours so that the vehicles could safely be recovered.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police 
said: 'Officers on the scene have reported the road is icy and driving 
conditions are treacherous.'

South
 Central Ambulance Service were advising motorists to take extra care 
after attending a number of crashes across Hampshire, Berkshire, 
Oxfordshire, and Buckinghamshire due to the icy conditions.

Black ice also caused a spate of crashes across Gloucestershire over the weekend.

Gloucestershire Police said there were dozens of accidents on high ground in the Cotswolds and Forest of Dean on Saturday morning.

In the Forest area a silver Renault Clio careered into a ditch on the B4215 at Rudford at just after 6am but the driver escaped uninjured.

A green Vauxhall Astra collided with a bus stop on the A48 in Minsterworth, near Gloucester, at 6.15am and the driver, a 36 year-old man was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital as a precautionary measure.

The bus stop was described as completely demolished.

The Highways Agency insisted it is equipped to cope with the cold snap, saying it has 500 state-of-the-art winter vehicles on standby and enough salt to deal with severe conditions.
