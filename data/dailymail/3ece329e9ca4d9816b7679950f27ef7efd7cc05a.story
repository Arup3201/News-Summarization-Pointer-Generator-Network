Brendan Rodgers has confirmed Mario Balotelli was right to take the penalty that secured Liverpool a crucial Europa League win as he clarified the moment of controversy.

The Italy striker was accused of being a little bit disrespectful by Steven Gerrard after he took the ball off Jordan Henderson in the dying moments of their last 32 clash with Besiktas.

But Rodgers, who feels 'a drama' has been made out of the incident, explained the system that is in place for what happens if Liverpool get a penalty.

Gerrard is the No1 taker but, in his absence last night, Henderson was designated to take over, given that Balotellli was a substitute. Once Balotelli came on, however, he was entitled to take charge of the situation as Rodgers says he is Gerrard's deputy.

Rodgers said: 'Steven and Mario are the top two penalty takers, but obviously neither of them were on the pitch at the start so you have to nominate someone. Jordan was nominated, but when we had a penalty Mario had come onto the field.

'So Jordan, being someone with responsibility and trust, gave the penalty to Mario so there was no issue. There was a little bit of a kerfuffle around it because he wanted to make sure Mario was happy to take it, but that was it really.

'I always assign responsibility every single game and I think in my time here that was been the first time this has ever reared its head. We have a whole raft of penalty takers here who are outstanding. Rickie Lambert has hardly missed a penalty in his career, so there is another taker if he is on the pitch.

'If you are the vice captain and the captain is on the bench and then he comes on, then it is the etiquette to give him the armband. It is a similar thing with the penalty. 

'If Steven is on the field there is no drama. He is the first choice penalty taker. After that if Mario is on the field he takes the penalty. His history shows he scored nearly 30 penalties in big games and he is an outstanding penalty taker.

Steven Gerrard, working as a pundit for ITV, accused Balotelli of being a little bit disrespectful

'But at the start none of them were on, so Jordan was the nominated penalty taker. Jordan was happy enough to take it, but he gave it to Mario. It is his goal there is no drama.'

Rodgers, whose side travel to Southampton on Sunday, was quick to praise Henderson for his maturity in the situation but he made a point of stressing that no decision has been made about whether the England international will take over the club captaincy when Gerrard eventually moves to LA Galaxy.

Rodgers said: 'Jordan showed what a team player he is. Mario is an outstanding penalty taker and we won the game. Jordan showed what a leader he is.

'People see him as that automatic next captain but that is not necessarily the case. People are trying to catapult him into the next Steven Gerrard but he is a totally different player. He is working his role very well. It is a very, very important role.'

The Italian striker eventually stepped up to fire in the winning penalty for Liverpool on Thursday night

All was well in the end though when Balotelli fired the penalty into Cenk Gonen's bottom corner for a 1-0 win

Balotelli's actions  angered some of his team-mates, and the striker's long-term future could be in doubt
