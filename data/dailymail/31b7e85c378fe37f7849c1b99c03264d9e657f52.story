Christopher Brassington caused £120,000 of damage to Rinaldi's restaurant in Wakefield, West Yorkshire after hearing claims the owner was seeing his wife

A jilted boyfriend who drunkenly ploughed a truck into a restaurant - after hearing a rumour the owner was seeing his ex - has been spared jail.

Christopher Brassington, 39, flew into a rage after hearing the mother of his children may have started a relationship with Glyn Margrave, the owner of Rinaldi's Italian restaurant in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

Leeds Crown Court heard that former property developer Brassington snatched a friend's truck and caused over £120,000 of damage to the eaterie on January 7 last year after downing six pints of lager.

Matthew Harding, prosecuting, told the court that Brassington heard the rumour during an pub drinking session with his former business partner Nigel Coxan.

Leaving the bar, Brassington jumped into the driver's seat of Mr Coxan's Toyota Hilux and drove to the restaurant, while his friend pleaded with him to stop.

Brassington then revved the engine and smashed it into the building, shattering glass and bulldozing chairs and tables inside, before it was stopped by a supporting post.

Johnny Watson, representing Brassington at an earlier hearing, claimed his client had not acted out of jealousy, but was having mental health problems.

He said: 'This is a bizarre entirely freakish incident which seems to have almost been taken from a Quentin Tarantino movie.'

Although Brassington, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, admitted criminal damage, dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and driving with excess alcohol, a judge deferred sentencing for six months to give him time to address his problems.

And at Leeds Crown Court yesterday, Judge Neil Clark was told that Brassington had got psychiatric help, stopped drinking and stayed out of trouble.

The pick-up screeched through the restaurant, smashing glass and scattering tables and chairs

The court heard Brassington was attempting a three-point turn in the devastated eatery before he was stopped by police

Judge Clark told Brassington that the previous judge in the case indicated that he would not jail him immediately if he had got help and he would honour that promise.

He handed Brassington a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with supervision and an 18 months driving disqualification.

During the hearing in October, prosecutor Mr Harding had told how, on the night in question: 'His friend said that the mother of the defendant's children was believed to be having a relationship with an individual that owned a local restaraunt, Rinaldi's.

'Mr Coxan said that he believed the defendant was aware of the relationship. He [Brassington] was surprised but not upset.'

The court heard how Coxan was sat in the passenger's seat screaming while the jilted lover committed his revenge.

The prosecutor said: 'He was relieved to see the restaurant was in darkness. The defendant went to the adjacent car park, facing the restaurant. He reversed the car about five metres.

'He said the only words he spoke during the journey were "I'm sorry". Then he accelerated towards the window.

'Mr Coxan was screaming. He recalled the defendant screaming. He remembers glass smashing and tables and chairs within the restaurant scattering.

The restaurant was left picking up the bill after the smash in January last year

Brassington got a suspended sentence this week after a judge heard he has since stopped drinking and sought psychiatric help

'The defendant drove four to five metres inside the restaurant before hitting a supporting post which stopped the vehicle.'

Mr Harding said that Brassington then appeared to attempt a three-point turn.

Police later arrived and pulled him out the car window before he held out his hands 'as if he was going to be handcuffed'.

The court previously heard Brassington had built a million pound property portfolio in the 1990s before suffering a mental breakdown.

At the time of the incident, he was also receiving psychiatric treatment, following the collapse of his business and a series of debts and financial hardship, the court heard.
