The angry father of Justin Lee Collins' ex-girlfriend said he hoped the disgraced comedian would be 'scrubbing toilets' following his conviction for harrassing her.

Just 24 hours after a jury convicted the long-haired, bearded performer of harassing recovering alcoholic Anna Larke, her father Jerry joined domestic violence 
charities in claiming the sentence was 'not hard enough'.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, he added: 'I 
would like to see him scrubbing toilets for the abuse he did to my 
daughter.'

Mr Larke's comments came after Mr Collins today refused to accept that he violently abused Ms Larke - but ruled out a legal appeal.

Collins, 38, issued a 
statement saying he would 'never accept the allegation that I am violent
or an abuser'.

The television presenter was found guilty of abusing his ex-girlfriend during a stormy
nine-month relationship last year. It followed a  ten-day trial which ended 
yesterday.

The former star of Channel 4’s Friday Night Project was ordered to carry
out 140 hours unpaid work as part of an 18-month community order.

Ms Larke, a recovering alcoholic, claimed Collins humiliated and 
controlled her, including forcing her to detail her sexual past in a 
notepad.

The jury also heard 
that during their relationship last year the entertainer 
made Ms Larke sleep facing him, and assaulted her.

Mr Larke, 67, of Welwyn Garden City, said he was initially charmed by 
Collins and only found about his behaviour toward his daughter when she 
went to the police.

He said: 'If I were to see Collins I would ask him one question - why? 
He has two beautiful little children, I have seen photographs of them.

'He is a very strange man, there is something wrong with him. In some 
respects I feel sorry for him, though that may be hard to believe. I 
think maybe something happened in his childhood, but it is difficult to 
say.

'She is a changed girl now, she has no confidence. Emotionally she is 
depressed. They kept on about her being a severe alcoholic, but she 
never had a drop of drink when she was with Collins.

'I think it will be a difficult job for her to recover, it will be very 
difficult. She was absolutely besotted with him. She is completely 
deflated now, there is no go in her at all.'

The court was told Collins even abused Ms Larke’s pet cat Jak, and her 
father said the family were distressed by an incident where Collins 
apparently left the animal with severe head injuries after putting him 
in a suitcase and swinging it around.

He said: 'He put the cat into a suitcase and swung it round in the air, the cat’s head was smashed.

'It had a terrible wound on the side of his head. Anna was very upset 
about it. The cat now is very strange, it is not the cat it used to be.'

After Collins was convicted he was photographed laughing, which he said today did not reflect how he really felt.

He said: 'The pictures that have been released of me laughing are in no way a reflection of my current mood.

'I
deeply regret the distress and anguish I have caused by my behaviour in
what was a very troubled and difficult relationship with Anna Larke.

'After careful reflection in the last 24 hours I have decided not to proceed with an appeal against my conviction.

'I
would like to re-iterate what I made clear in court, that I have never 
used or threatened violence against Anna Larke or anybody in my life.

'I
accept that the jury have found elements of my conduct amounted to 
harassment which I apologise for unreservedly, but I will never accept 
the allegation that I am violent or an abuser.'

Collins
insisted he only ever gently slapped Ms Larke twice - when she was 
hysterical and relapsing into alcoholism. And he told the court she was 
jealous, obsessive and possessive.

The trial at St Albans Crown Court heard Collins, who met Ms Larke while
he was still married, frequently grabbed her hair, slapped her, made 
sexually derogatory comments about her and deprived her of sleep.

He even made her throw away DVDs because they featured actors she found 
attractive, she said, and on one occasion on a drunken night out with 
fellow comic Alan Carr, he pushed her in front of a taxi.

After deliberating for nearly 12 hours over three days, the jury agreed 
by a 10-1 majority that he had subjected her to months of harassment and
abuse after they moved in together in January last year.

Sentencing Collins and ordering him to pay £3,500 costs, Judge John 
Plumstead told him his community service should be 'humbling work' for 
someone with such a prominent career in showbusiness.

He said: 'This is not a run-of-the-mill case of domestic violence, as I 
see it. What happened between you and Miss Larke was genuinely out of 
character.

'You became increasingly unable to deal with the difficulties in your 
relationship and on more than one occasion you lost your self-control 
and acted in a violent way.'

Collins, of Kew,, had denied the charge of harassment by causing fear of 
violence. He claimed Ms Larke, 38, was obsessive, jealous and described 
the relationship as 'absolute hell'.

Her brother Alex, 33, a musician, said he hoped Collins would get help 
after being convicted, adding: 'I don’t wish that his career is damaged 
or anything like that. He has been through a lot but it is his own 
doing.

'There was an opportunity for him to say "I have done this and now I want to get help" and people would have had more sympathy.'

Domestic violence charities hit out at the sentence.

Sandra Horley, 
chief executive of Refuge, said: 'Until the courts give sentences that 
fit the crime, men like Justin Lee Collins will get away with campaigns 
of terror and thousands of women, like Anna, will continue to be at 
risk.'

Vivienne Hayes, chief executive of the Women’s Resource Centre, said: 'The problem with such a light sentence is that it sends out a message 
to both men and women that domestic violence is not that serious, when 
in reality we know that its impacts are devastating.'

But Collins’s wife Karen, who is divorcing the presenter and gave 
evidence saying he was "gentle, kind and generous", defended him after 
the sentence.

Speaking from her home in Bristol yesterday, she told the Daily Mail the
guilty verdict was 'ridiculous’. She said: 'At the moment my priority 
is the children. But I can say that I think the verdict is ridiculous. I
don’t believe it even for one second.'
